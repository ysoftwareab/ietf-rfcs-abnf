Abstract

   [USRK] proposes a new mechanism for deriving cryptographically
   separate usage specific root keys (USRK) from the EAP extended master
   session key (EMSK).  This document follows the procedure suggested in
   [USRK] to derive root keys for Mobile IPv4, Mobile IPv6, and proxy
   Mobile IP.

Internet-Draft                MIP root key                  October 2006


1.  Introduction

   Many network protocols require keys for supporting various security
   mechanisms associated with these protocols.  With the growing number
   of users and devices, manual configuration of such keys is no longer
   feasible due to system scalability and cost requirements set for
   networks today.  This calls for dynamic key management mechanisms for
   most of these protocols so that the administrative burden of
   configuring devices with the required keys is reduced.  However, with
   the increasing number of protocols needing short term keys and
   employing dynamic key management, both the implementation burden of
   deploying various key management mechanisms and the amount of real
   time spent executing these mechanisms during a power up are becoming
   issues.

   Extensible authentication protocol authentication [RFC3748] and key
   management framework [EAPkeying] provide a powerful tool for key
   management by authenticating an end client to a central AAA/ EAP
   server and establishing a master session key (MSK) and an extended
   master session key (EMSK).

   However, EAP documentations [RFC3748] and [EAPkeying] do not provide
   any specification for use of EMSK.  There has been several proposals
   within and outside IETF to use EMSK to arrive at the so called
   application master session keys (AMSK) for various applications or
   later called as usage specific root keys (USRK) [USRK].  There has
   been a growing tendency to use EMSK resulting from the EAP exchange
   to derive keys for other network protocols and thereby reduce the
   need for multiple key management mechanisms.  Different
   specifications have been using arbitrary key derivation functions
   (KDF), arbitrary KDF inputs, and arbitrary key labels, legitimizing
   the following imminent concerns:

   1) At no circumstance should the compromise of an USRK for an
   application lead to the compromise of the parent EMSK, since this
   would lead to jeopardizing all other applications.  This is called
   cryptographic separation of EMSK from the child-USRKs for all the
   application that have used that EMSK.  This means a strong key
   derivation function should be used.  For instance deriving an EMSK
   from a known USRK should be as complex as reversing a hash function.

   2) Deriving USRK-1 for usage 1 (application 1) from an EMSK, should
   not jeopardize the integrity of keys for other usages that have used
   the same EMSK to derive their USRKs.  This would not only mean strong
   KDF functions should be used, but also that different derivations
   using the same EMSK do not arrive at the same USRKs.  Therefore, to
   assure cryptographic separation between different USRKs and to reduce
   the over all key management implementation burden in a system, it is

   desired that all the usages within the system use the same default
   KDF.  Furthermore, since a KDF always produces the same output for
   the same input, various usages need to follow a standardized
   procedure in using the KDF.

   [USRK] is the latest attempt towards specific keys for various usages
   in a coordinated manner to address the aforementioned concerns.  This
   draft discusses the use of procedures in [USRK] to specify USRK
   derivations for both Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 security needs.
   Note that the draft may not go into the details of using the USRK in
   deriving all the keys within the Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 key
   hierarchy.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are taken from [RFC3748]: EAP Server, peer,
   authenticator, Extended Master Session Key (EMSK).

   HA

   Home agent.  It is defeined in Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344] and Mobile IPv6
   [RFC3775] specifications.

   FA

   Foreign Agent, It is defined in Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344] specification.

   MSA

   Mobility Service Authorizer.  It is defined in mip6 bootstrapping
   problem statement [RFC4640] specification.

   MSP

   Mobility Service Provider.  It is defined in mip6 bootstrapping
   problem statement [RFC4640] specification.

   USRK

   Usage specific root key.  It is keying material derived from the EMSK
   for a particular usage definition.  It is used to derive child keys
   in a way defined by its usage definition.

   MIP4_USRK

   MIP4_USRK is the root key for mip4 protocol usages.  It is derived
   from the EMSK, while other child keys for mip4 usage are derived from
   MIP4_USRK.

   MIP6_USRK

   MIP6_USRK is the root key for mip6 protocol usages.  It is derived
   from the EMSK , while other child keys for mip6 usage are derived
   from MIP6_USRK.

   KDF

   KDF is the abbreviation of key derivation function.  The USRK key
   derivation function (KDF) derives an USRK from the Extended Master
   Session Key (EMSK) .  The USRK KDF is expected to give the same
   output for the same input.

   PRF/PRF+

   Pseudo random function.  PRF and PRF+ are defined in [RFC4306].

   MIP6_MN_HA_key

   MIP6_MN_HA_key is used for protecting Mobile IPv6 signaling between
   MN and HA.

   MIP6_IKEv2_key

   MIP6_IKEv2_key is the IKEv2 pre-shared key which is used in the IKEv2
   exchange needed for establishment of an MN-HA IPsec SA.

   MN_HA_MIP4_key

   MN_HA_MIP4_key is used for protecting Mobile IPv4 signaling between
   MN and HA.

   PMN_HA_MIP4_key

   PMN_HA_MIP4_key is used for protecting proxy MIP4 signaling between
   proxy mobile node and HA.

   MN_FA_MIP4_key

   MN_FA_MIP4_key is used for protecting Mobile IPv4 signaling between
   MN and FA.

3.  Key Distribution function (KDF)

   We are following the [USRK] recommendation on KDF.

   KDF = PRF(key, US_data)

   [USRK] suggests the use of PRF+ from IKEv2 specification [RFC4306] as
   a default PRF for derivation of USRK for derivations of root keys for
   all usage definitions, unless otherwise specifically stated.
   "US_data" stands for usage specific data and will be defined shortly.
   The PRF+ is defined as follows:

   prf+ (Key, US_Data) = T1 | T2 | T3 | T4 | ...

   Where:

   T1 = PRF (Key, US_Data | 0x01)

   T2 = PRF (Key, T1 | US_Data | 0x02)

   T3 = PRF (Key, T2 | US_Data | 0x03)

   T4 = PRF (Key, T3 | US_Data | 0x04)

   The notion of PRF+ means the same PRF will be executed over and over
   to provide as long keying material as needed (T1, T2, T3, etc).  In
   deriving Mobile IP usage specific root keys (MIP4_USRK, MIP6_USRK),
   we will follow this recommendation and suggest the use of HMAC_SHA-
   256 as PRF (defined in [SHA256]). for deriving USRKs from the EMSK.
   Furthermore, the "key" above is the extended master session key
   (EMSK) derived from execution of an EAP method.  So the expression
   for PRF+ used in Mobile IP USRK derivations is defined as follows

   prf+ (EMSK, US_Data) = T1 | T2 | T3 | T4 | ...

   Where:

   T1 = HMAC-SHA-256 (EMSK, US_Data | 0x01)

   T2 = HMAC-SHA-256 (EMSK, T1 | US_Data | 0x02)

   T3 = HMAC-SHA-256 (EMSK, T2 | US_Data | 0x03)

   T4 = HMAC-SHA-256 (EMSK, T3 | US_Data | 0x04)

   The usage_specific data (US_Data) is defined as follows.

   US_data=Key label + "\0" + op-data + length

Internet-Draft                MIP root key                  October 2006


   Key label = ASCII key label

   The ASCII key label will be defined for each usage (Mobile IPv4 and
   Mobile IPv6) in the relevant sections of this document later on.

   op-data = optional data

   The "optional data" will be defined for each usage (Mobile IPv4 and
   Mobile IPv6) later in this document.

   length = 2 byte unsigned integer in network byte order

   '\0' = is a NUL byte (0x00 in hex)

   + denotes concatenation

   It should be noted that only the USRKs for Mobile IPv4 and Mobile
   IPv6 (MIP4_USRK, MIP6_USRK) need to follow this procedure; it is not
   required for each of these applications to use the same PRF+ in
   creating further child keys from the USRKs.  For instance, the Mobile
   IPv4 function may use a different PRF when deriving MN-HA-key from
   MIP4_USRK, if necessary.  The mandate on use of PRF+ for the Mobile
   IP USRK, while allowing for use of weaker PRFs for usage specific
   child keys, assures the EMSK and the USRK for other non-Mobile IP
   usages are not compromised unnecessarily.

4.  Mobile IPv6 USRK derivation

   Section 3 defines the USRK formula.  This section will explain the
   mip6 usage specific data according to the USRK formula.  The MIP6-
   USRK is generated below:

   MIP6_T1 = HMAC-SHA-256 (EMSK, "MIP6 USRK derivation"|<MSA_ID>|
   <MSP_ID> |EAP session ID| MN_ID| 128 | 0x01 )

   MIP6_T2 = HMAC-SHA-256 (EMSK, MIP6_T1 | "MIP6 USRK derivation" |
   <MSA_ID>|<MSP_ID>| EAP session ID| MN_ID|128 | 0x02)

   MIP6_USRK=MIP6_T1 | MIP6_T2

   The details are explained as follows:

   -The MIP6_USRK is generated from EMSK.

   -We assume a key length of 256 bits is sufficient for MIP6_USRK.

   -SHA256 [SHA256] creates 128 security bits and hence we will create
   both MIP6_T1 and MIP6_T2 to have a total of 256 security bits, even
   though the result of the hash after running PRF twice would be 512.

   -The key label of MIP6_USRK is "MIP6 USRK derivation"

   -op-data = <MSA_ID>|<MSP_ID> |EAP session ID| MN_ID

   <> indicates that an attribute is optional.

   MSA is Mobility service authorizer (can be AAA server authorizing MN
   for MIP6 service) and MSP is mobility service provider providing MIP6
   service to the MN.  So it is up to deployment scenario and operators
   policy to include these identifiers in the key generation data.

   MN_ID is an identifier for the MN, so that the MN is recognizable by
   the entity that generates the MIP6_USRK.  Depending on the MIP6
   bootstrapping scenario and instance and entity at which the MIP6_USRK
   is being generated and the MIP6 service to MN is being authorized at,
   the MN_ID may be different.  A number of alternatives for MN_ID is as
   follows:

   -FQDN for the MN.

   -NAI for the MN.

   -IPv6 HoA address for MN.

   EAP session ID is used for identifying the EAP session.

   The MIP6-USRK key name is defined below:

   MIP6 USRK key name = HMAC-SHA-256( EAP Session-ID, "MIP6_USRK
   derivation"| 64)

   All other MIP6 related keys, including MN-HA key and IKEv2 pre-shared
   key are derived as child keys of the MIP6-USRK.  Even though, it is
   not required to use the same KDF in derviation of these child keys,
   for simplicity, we use HMAC_SHA_256 in those derivation.

   MN-HA key is required in [RFC4285] which is used for building
   security association between mobile node and Home Agent.

   IKEv2 pre-shared key is required in [RFC3776] which is used for
   generating AUTH value.

   Figure 1 shows the key hierarchy of the mip6 key:
                                ---------
                               |MIP6_USRK|
                                ---------
                                   |
                 +---------------------------------+
                 |                 |               |
                 |                 |               |
                 |                 |               |
         --------------    --------------    ---------------
        |MIP6_MN_HA_key|  |MIP6_IKEv2_key|  |other MIP6 keys|
         --------------    --------------    ---------------

                       Figure 1 Mip6 key hierarchy

   The MIP6_MN_HA_key key generation formula is shown below:

   MIP6_MN_HA_key = HMAC-SHA-256(MIP6_USRK, "MN-HA key derivation"|
   <HA_ID> | MN_ID | 128)

   The details are explained as follows:

   - [RFC4285] requires the MIP6_MN_HA_key length must be 16 octets.

   -The key label of MIP6_MN_HA_key is "MN-HA key derivation"

   -op-data = <HA_ID> | MN_ID

   <> indicates that an attribute is optional.

   MN_ID and HA_ID is used for identifying the two entities who share
   the key.  The MN_ID should match that used in Mobile IPv6 signaling
   or bootstrapping.  Depending on whether at the time of the key
   derivation an HA is assigned to the MN, The HA_ID may be left out.
   It is however recommended that MN_HA_keys are derived including HA_ID
   and after the HA is assigned to assure proper key scoping.

   The MIP6_IKEv2_key key generation formula is shown below:

   MIP6_IKEv2_key=HMAC-SHA-256(MIP6_USRK, "IKEv2 pre-shared key
   derivation" | MN_ID| HA_ID | 128)

   The details are explained as follows:

   - [RFC4306] requires the length of the IKEv2 pre-shared key to rely
   on the length requirement of the negotiated prf.  If the pre-shared
   key length does not match the requirement of prf, the key will be
   truncated or padded with zeros as necessary.  So we set the default
   length of the IKEv2 pre-shared key to 128 bits.

   -The key label is "IKEv2 pre-shared key derivation"

   -op-data = MN_ID| HA_ID

   MN_ID and HA_ID are used for identifying the two entities who share
   the key.  The MN_ID should match that used in Mobile IPv6 signaling
   or bootstrapping.  MN_ID and HA_ID are both important, since they are
   used for IKEv2.

   It is possible that MIP6 application or its related protocols, such
   as fast Mobile IPv6 will require other keys for their operation.
   Such keys can be generated in a similar manner from the MIP6_USRK as
   shown in figure 1.

5.  Mobile IPv4 USRK derivation

   The mobile ipv4 key generation is similar to mip6 key generation.
   This section explains the mip4 usage specific data according to the
   USRK formula defined in section 3.  The MIP4_USRK is generated below:

   MIP4_T1 = HMAC-SHA-256 (EMSK, "MIP4 USRK derivation"|AAAH_ID |MN_ID|
   EAP session ID| 128 | 0x01 )

   MIP4_T2 = HMAC-SHA-256 (EMSK, MIP4_T1 | "MIP4 USRK derivation" |
   AAAH_ID| MN_ID|EAP session ID| 128 | 0x02)

   MIP4_USRK=MIP4_T1 | MIP4_T2

   The details are explained as follows:

   -The MIP4_USRK is generated from EMSK.

   -We assume a key length of 256 bits is sufficient for MIP6_USRK.

   -SHA256 [SHA256] creates 128 security bits and hence we will create
   both MIP4_T1 and MIP4_T2 to have a total of 256 security bits, even
   though the result of the hash after running PRF twice would be 512.

   -The key label of MIP4_USRK is "MIP4 USRK derivation".

   -op-data = AAAH_ID |MN_ID|EAP session ID

   AAAH_ID is used for identifying the operator attributes.  So it is up
   to deployment scenario and operators policy to include these
   identifiers in the key generation data.

   MN_ID is an identifier for the MN, so that the MN is recognizable by
   the entity that generates the MIP4_USRK.  Depending on the MIP4
   bootstrapping scenario and instance and entity at which the MIP4_USRK
   is being generated and the MIP4 service to MN is being authorized at,
   the MN_ID may be different.  A number of alternatives for MN_ID is as
   follows:

   -FQDN for the MN

   -NAI for the MN

   -IPv4 HoA address for MN

   EAP session ID is used for identifying the EAP session.

   The MIP4-USRK key name is defined below:

   MIP4 USRK key name = HMAC-SHA-256( EAP Session-ID, "MIP4 USRK
   derivation"| 64)

   All other MIP4 related keys including MN-HA-MIP4-key, MN-HA-PMIP4-
   key,FA-MIP4-root-key and MN-FA-MIP4-key are derived as child keys of
   the MIP4-USRK.  Figure 2 shows the MIP4 key hierarchy.

   The MN_HA_MIP4_key key generation formula is shown below:

   MN_HA_MIP4_key = HMAC-SHA-256(MIP4_USRK, "MN-HA key derivation"|
   <HA_ID> | MN_ID | AAAH_ID |128)

   The details are explained as follows:

   -The length of MN_HA_MIP4_key is set default to 128 bits.

   -The key label of MN_HA_MIP4_key is "MN-HA key derivation".

   -op-data = <HA_ID> | MN_ID | AAAH_ID

   <> indicates that an attribute is optional.

   AAAH_ID is used for identifying the operator attributes.  So it is up
   to deployment scenario and operators policy to include these
   identifiers in the key generation data.

   MN_ID and HA_ID is used for identifying the two entities who share
   the key.  The MN_ID should match that used in Mobile IPv4 signaling
   or bootstrapping.  Depending on whether at the time of the key
   derivation an HA is assigned to the MN, The HA_ID may be left out.
   It is however recommended that MN_HA_keys are derived including HA_ID

   and after the HA is assigned to assure proper key scoping.

   The PMN_HA_MIP4_key key generation formula is shown below:

   PMN_HA_MIP4_key = HMAC-SHA-256(MIP4_USRK, "PMN-HA key derivation"|
   <HA_ID> | PMN_ID | AAAH_ID |128)

   The details are explained as follows:

   -The length of PMN_HA_MIP4_key is set default to 128 bits.

   -The key label of MN_HA_PMIP4_key is "PMN-HA key derivation".

   -op-data = <HA_ID> | PMN_ID | AAAH_ID

   AAAH_ID is used for identifying the operator attributes.  So it is up
   to deployment scenario and operators policy to include these
   identifiers in the key generation data.

   PMN_ID and HA_ID is used for identifying the two entities who share
   the key.  The PMN_ID should match that used in proxy Mobile IPv4
   signaling.

   The MN_FA_MIP4_key key generation formula is shown below:

   MN_FA_MIP4_key = HMAC-SHA-256(MIP4_USRK , "MN-HA MIP4 key
   derivation"| FA_ID | MN_ID | AAAH_ID |128)

   The details are explained as follows:

   -The key label of MN_FA_MIP4_key is "MN-HA MIP4 key derivation".

   -The length of MN_FA_MIP4_key is set default to 128 bits.

   -op-data = FA_ID | MN_ID | AAAH_ID

   AAAH_ID is used for identifying the operator attributes.  So it is up
   to deployment scenario and operators policy to include these
   identifiers in the key generation data.

   MN_ID and FA_ID is used for identifying the two entities who share
   the key.  The MN_ID should match that used in Mobile IPv4 signaling
   or bootstrapping.

   The FA_HA_MIP4_Root key generation formula is shown below:

   FA_HA_MIP4_Root = HMAC-SHA-256(MIP4_USRK, "FA-MIP4 root key
   derivation"| HA_ID|FA_ID | AAAH_ID |128)

   The details are explained as follows:

   -The length of FA_HA_MIP4_Root is set default to 128 bits.

   -The key label of FA_HA_MIP4_Root is "FA-MIP4 root key derivation".

   -op-data = HA_ID| FA_ID | AAAH_ID

   AAAH_ID is used for identifying the operator attributes.  So it is up
   to deployment scenario and operators policy to include these
   identifiers in the key generation data.

   FA_ID and HA_ID is used for identifying the two entities who share
   the key.  This key be used as is, or as a pre-shared key for an FA-HA
   IKE.  So FA_ID and HA_ID are both important.

6.  security considerations

   This draft recommends the use of a default PRF (PRF+) according to
   [RFC4306] for deriving all USRKs from an EMSK.  There may be cases
   where a system operator has specified a policy and/or configured
   devices within a system to use a different system-wide PRF.  The
   other exception to this rule would be if Mobile IPv4 or Mobile IPv6
   had specific messaging process for PRF negotation, but this is not
   the case.
