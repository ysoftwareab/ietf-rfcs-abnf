Internet-Draft         Extended Auth Names for Bos         December 2010


1.  Introduction

   AFS-3 provides a management service (the "basic overseer service", or
   "bos" for short) which manages service wide configuration
   information, and launches the daemons which provide each of the
   individual AFS services.  This management service also maintains a
   list of identities which are granted super user privileges to bos
   itself, and to the services it manages.  This list is maintained via
   a number of RX remote procedure calls which can be used to list, add,
   and remove identities.  Traditionally, AFS-3's security model was
   Kerberos v4 based, and the existing RPCs for managing the super user
   list are based around Kerberos v4 names.

   Extended authentication names [I-D.brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names]
   provide a mechanism for encapsulating a wider variety of name types
   within the AFS-3 system.  These new identity types bring with them a
   requirement to be able to manipulate bos super user lists containing
   extended identities.


2.  Error codes

   The existing BZNOENT, BZEXISTS and BZPERM error codes are used by the
   RPCs defined within this document.


3.  RPC Interface

   Three new RPCs are defined for the bos service.  These are direct
   equivalents of existing RPCs, with the exception that they add
   support for extended authentication names.

3.1.  AddSuperIdentity

   This is a direct equivalent of the existing AddSUser call.  It adds
   an identity to the service's super user list.

           AddSuperIdentity(IN struct PrAuthName *name) = XXX;

   On success, the call returns 0.  If the user doesn't have sufficient
   permission, then BZACCESS is returned.  If the given identity already
   exists within the super user list BZEXISTS is returned.

   When called with a name with the PRAUTHTYPE_KRB4 data type (a
   Kerberos v4 name), the behaviour of this function MUST be identical
   to that of the existing AddSUser function.

3.2.  DeleteSuperIdentity

   This is a direct equivalent of the existing DeleteSUser call.  It
   deletes an identity from the service's super user list.

           DeleteSuperIdentity(IN struct PRAuthName *name) = XXX;

   On success, the call returns 0.  If the user doesn't have sufficient
   permission, then BZACCESS is returned.  If the identity doesn't exist
   within the super user list, then BZNOENT is returned.

   When called with a name with the PRAUTHTYPE_KRB4 data type the
   behaviour of this function MUST be identical to that of the existing
   DeleteSUser function

3.3.  ListSuperIdentities

   This is an equivalent to the existing ListSUsers call.  It provides a
   mechanism for building an iterator over the server's super user list.

           ListSuperIdentities(IN afs_int32 cookie,
                               OUT struct PRAuthName *name,
                               OUT afs_int32 *newcookie) = XXX;

   The first time this function is called, cookie MUST be set to 0.  The
   server will then return the first entry in the super user list (or
   BZNOENT, if the super user list is empty).  In newcookie, it will
   return a value that can be used to obtain the next entry from the
   server, or 0 if the current entry is the last one.  The client may
   then repeat its call using newcookie as the cookie value, until it
   has obtained the desired number of entries, or until newcookie is 0,
   and the iteration is complete.

   This call MUST return all super users registered with the bos server,
   regardless of whether they were created using the RPCs defined in
   this document, or by the existing AFS-3 bos RPCs.  Names created
   through the AddSUser interface should be returned as PRAuthNames with
   the PRAUTHTYPE_KRB4 type, as detailed in the extended authentication
   name specification.

   On success, the RPC will return 0.  If the user doesn't have
   sufficient permissions to read the super user list, then BZACCESS is
   returned.  If an entry pointed to by a specific cookie has ceased to
   exist, or if the super user list is empty, then BZNOENT is returned.

4.  Behaviour of existing RPCs

   The existing RPCs, and the ones described within this document, MUST
   both provide access to the same super user list.  Where equivalent
   functionality is available to both new, and old, RPCs, there should
   be no observable difference between using the old or new forms.

   Calling AddSUser must have an identical result to calling
   AddSuperIdentity on the corresponding Kerberos v4 name

   Calling DeleteSUser must have an identical result to calling
   DeleteSuperIdentity on the corresponding Kerberos v4 name

   The ListSUsers RPC only iterates over Kerberos v4 form names.  Due to
   the behaviour of existing clients spaces MUST NOT be left in the
   iteration sequence for extended identities in the user list.  This
   means that ListSUsers will present an incomplete view of the super
   identities present on a particular server.  Consideration SHOULD,
   therefore, be given to removing the ListSUsers call when support for
   the RPCs listed in this document is added.


5.  Security Considerations

   Current AFS-3 implementations provide a high degree of access to
   identities on the super user list.  Whilst this document doesn't
   proscribe particular levels of access control for the RPCs it
   specifies, implementers should consider whether restricting these
   RPCs to particular security classes, and protection levels, is
   appropriate

   PrAuthNames contain both display and exported name forms, with the
   display name being provided purely for user interface purposes.  When
   returning names to the client, servers MUST regenerate the display
   name from the given exported name.  Where regeneration is impossible
   (for instance, because the name's underlying mechanism is
   unavailable), servers must indicate that the display name is
   unverified.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document doesn't require any IANA registrations.


7.  AFS-3 Registry Considerations

   This documentation requires the registration of code points for the 3
