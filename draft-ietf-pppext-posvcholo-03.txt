Abstract

   The RFC 1661 Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard
   method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point
   links. The RFC 1662 PPP in HDLC-like Framing [2] and RFC 2615 PPP
   over SONET/SDH (POS) [3] documents describe the use of PPP over
   Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and Synchronous Digital
   Hierarchy (SDH) circuits.

   This document proposes an extension to the mapping of PPP into
   SONET/SDH defined in RFC 2615 PPP over SONET/SDH (POS) [3], to
   include use of SONET/SDH SPE/VC virtual concatenation and use of
   both high order and low order payloads.

   This document has two objectives. The first is to provide the status
   of this proposal in the telecommunications standards definition
   process. The second is to propose the establishment of an RFC for
   this extension to RFC 2615 in order to facilitate industry adoption
   of the technique.

   With respect to the former objective, the current situation is that
   work in ANSI, ETSI & ITU-T has resulted in the establishment of a
   global standard for virtual concatenation. The next updates to ANSI
   T1.105/ANSI T1.105.02, ITU-T G.707/G.783 and ETSI EN 300 417-9-1
   will contain a formal definition of SONET/SDH payload virtual
   concatenation.

   This document is the product of the Point-to-Point Protocol
   Extensions Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF). Comments should be submitted to the ietf-ppp@merit.edu
   mailing list.

1. Introduction

   Current implementations of PPP over SONET/SDH are required to select
   transport structures from the relatively limited number of
   contiguously concatenated signals that are available

   The only currently supported SONET/SDH SPE/VCs in RFC 2615 [3] are
   the following:

          SONET                   SDH
      ----------------------------------------
      STS-3c-SPE                  VC-4
      STS-12c-SPE                 VC-4-4c
      STS-48c-SPE                 VC-4-16c
      STS-192c-SPE                VC-4-64c

   Note that VC-4-4c and above are not widely supported in SDH networks
   at present.

   The use of virtual concatenation means that the right size SONET/SDH
   bandwidth can be selected for PPP links.

   For the convenience of the reader, the equivalent terms are listed
   below:

          SONET                   SDH
      ---------------------------------------------
      SPE                         VC
      VT (1.5/2/6)                Low order VC (VC-11/12/2)
      STS SPE                     Higher Order VC (VC-3/4/4-Nc)
      STS-1 frame                 STM-0 frame (rarely used)
      STS-1 SPE                   VC-3
      STS-1-nv                    VC-3-nv (virtual concatenation)
      STS-1 payload               C-3
      STS-3c frame                STM-1 frame, AU-4
      STS-3c SPE                  VC-4
      STS-3c-nv                   VC-4-nv (virtual concatenation)
      STS-3c payload              C-4
      STS-12c/48c/192c frame      STM-4/16/64 frame, AU-4-4c/16c/64c
      STS-12c/48c/192c-SPE        VC-4-4c/16c/64c
      STS-12c/48c/192c payload    C-4-4c/16c/64c

   This table is an extended version of the equivalent table in RFC
   2615 [3]. Additional information on the above terms can be found in
   Bellcore GR-253-CORE [4], ANSI T1.105 [5], ANSI T1.105.02 [6] and
   ITU-T G.707 [7].

2. Rate Comparisons

   Currently supported WAN bandwidth links for PPP over SONET/SDH:

        ANSI                   ETSI
     -----------------------------------------------------
       STS-3c (150Mbit/s)     STM-1 (150Mbit/s)
       STS-12c (620Mbit/s)    STM-4 AU-4-4c (620Mbit/s)
       STS-48c (2.4Gbit/s)    STM-16 AU-4-16c (2.4Gbit/s)
       STS-192c (9.6Gbit/s)   STM-64 AU-4-64c (9.6Gbit/s)

   Note that AU-4-4c and AU-4-16c are not generally available in SDH
   networks at present.

   With virtual concatenation the following additional WAN bandwidth
   links would be available for PPP over SONET/SDH:

         SONET

       STS-1-nv  (n=1-64)       49Mbit/s-3.1Gbit/s
       STS-3c-nv (n=1-64)       150Mbit/s-10Gbit/s

         SDH

       VC-3-nv  (n=1-64)        49Mbit/s-3.1Gbit/s
       VC-4-nv  (n=1-64)        150Mbit/s-10Gbit/s

   Higher levels of virtual concatenation are possible, but not
   necessarily useful. Lower levels of virtual concatenation are
   defined in the telecommunications standards for use if needed.

   Table 1 and Table 2,respectively depict the SONET/SDH transport
   structures that are currently available to carry various popular bit
   rates. Each table contains three columns. The first column shows the
   bit rates of the service to be transported.

   The next column contains two values:

   a) the logical signals that are currently available to provide such
   transport and, b) in parenthesis, the percent efficiency of the
   given transport signal without the use of virtual concatenation.

   Likewise, the final column also contains two values:

   a) the logical signals that are currently available to provide such
   transport and, b) in parenthesis, the percent efficiency of the
   given transport signal with the use of virtual concatenation.

Internet Draft           POS with VC, HO & LO            December 2000



   Note, that Table 1, contains SONET transport signals with the
   following effective payload capacity: STS-1 SPE = 49.536 Mbit/s,
   STS-3c SPE = 149.760 Mbit/s, STS-12c SPE = 599.040 Mbit/s, STS-48c
   SPE = 2,396.160 Mbit/s and STS-192c SPE = 9,584.640 Mbit/s.

        Table 1. SONET Virtual Concatenation

      Bit rate     Without            With
     --------------------------------------------

      100Mbit/s   STS-3c (67%)  STS-1-2v (100%)
      200Mbit/s   STS-12c(33%)  STS-1-4v (100%)
      1Gbit/s     STS-48c(42%)  STS-3c-7v (95%)


   Similarly, Table 2, contains SDH transport signals with the
   following effective payload capacity: VC-3 = 48.960 Mbit/s, VC-4 =
   149.760 Mbit/s, VC-4-4c = 599.040 Mbit/s, VC-4-16c = 2,396.160
   Mbit/s and VC-4-64c = 9,584.640 Mbit/s.

        Table 2. SDH Virtual Concatenation

      Bit rate     Without            With
     -------------------------------------------

      100Mbit/s   VC-4 (67%)    VC-3-2v (100%)
      200Mbit/s   VC-4-4c(33%)  VC-3-4v (100%)
      1Gbit/s     VC-4-16c(42%) VC-4-7v (95%)



3. Physical Layer Requirements

   There are two minor modifications to the physical layer requirements
   as defined in RFC 2615 when virtually concatenated SPEs/VCs are used
   to provide transport for PPP over SONET/SDH.

   First, the path signal label (C2 byte) value is required to be the
   same for all constituent channels. This is in contrast to the use of
   a single C2 byte for PPP transport over contiguously concatenated
   SONET/SDH SPE/VCs. The values used for the C2 bytes should be in
   accordance with RFC 2615.

   Second, the multi-frame indicator (H4) byte will be unused for
   transport links utilizing contiguously concatenated SONET/SDH
   SPE/VCs. When the concatenation scheme is "virtual" as opposed to
   "contiguous" the H4 byte must be populated as per ITU-T G.707 or
   T1.105.02.

4. Standards Status

   ITU-T (SG13/SG15), ANSI T1X1 and ETSI TM1/WP3 have developed global
   standards for SONET/SDH High Order and Low Order payload Virtual
   Concatenation. These changes will appear in the following standards:

        ITU-T G.803 Architecture of transport networks based on the
        synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH)

        ITU-T G.707 Network Node Interface for the Synchronous Digital
        Hierarchy (SDH)

        ITU-T G.783 Characteristics of Synchronous Digital Hierarchy
        (SDH) Equipment Functional Blocks

        ANSI T1.105 Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) - Basic
        Description including Multiplex Structure, Rates and Formats

        ANSI T1.105.02 Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) - Payload
        Mappings

        ETSI EN 300 417-9-1 Transmission and Multiplexing (TM) Generic
        requirements of transport functionality of equipment Part 9:
        Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) concatenated path layer
        functions. Subpart 1: Requirements

   Work in ITU-T, ANSI T1X1 and ETSI TM1/WP3 has ensured global
   standards alignment.

   With the completion of a standard for SONET/SDH SPE/VC virtual
   concatenation  it is now  appropriate to consider the use of this
   standard for PPP transport over SONET/SDH. In this regards, and with
   a view to preserving RFC 2615 "as is", we propose that a separate
   RFC be issued for this extension to RFC 2615

5. Security Considerations

   documents that arise from it would contain security consideration.
