Internet-Draft    DSTM IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel profile for Tunnel Setup Protocol(TSP)                                        July 2002


1. Introduction

   Based on the actions they perform, The network model presented in
   DSTM [1] defines three types of equipments: a DSTM server, DSTM nodes
   and a Tunnel End Point (TEPs).  Within this model, a protocol is
   required for configuration data exchange among these equipments.
   This document presents a method to perform these actions based on TSP
   [2].

   The Tunnel Setup Protocol, TSP, is a protocol designed to negotiate
   tunnel information, such as IP addresses, network prefixes and
   routing information.  TSP provides optional authentication, transport
   over IPv6 and redundancy of the service.  Other protocols, such as
   DHCPv6 [4], can be used to deploy DSTM but, in the short term, such
   protocols may be more complex to implement.

   The use of TSP for DSTM address allocation and tunnel set up demands
   the definition of four types of messages:

   o  'Tunnel Create' messages are used to request the establishment of
      a 4over6 tunnel between a node and a given TEP.  For first-time
      requests, tunnel creation implies the allocation of a temporary
      IPv4 address to the requesting node.  In addition, this type of
      message is also used to ask for extension of the validity of an
      already allocated address.

   o  'Tunnel Delete' messages are sent by the server to destroy an
      existing 4over6 tunnel.  The server MUST send this type of message
      to the client (and to the TEP, if server and TEP are not co-
      located) when the allocation timer for a given address expires.

   o  'Tunnel Info' messages are sent as a reply to Tunnel Create or
      Tunnel Delete requests.  This type of message may contain
      configuration data to be used by a node, or simply confirm the
      creation/deletion of a 4over6 tunnel.

   o  Finally, Error Messages inform about the impossibility to allocate
      a temporary address or establish a 4over6 tunnel.

   TSP provides authentication services using SASL [5].  If DSTM client
   authentication is required, the DSTM server can be configured to
   negotiate with the client the authentication scheme that will be
   used.  In this mode, only authenticated clients are authorized to
   receive an IPv4 address.  If no authentication is required, the
   ANONYMOUS authentication scheme can be used to allow any client to
   receive a temporary IPv4 address.

2. General Description of the Protocol

   Figure 2.1 presents the message exchanges required by DSTM when the
   allocation process is started by a DSTM node.  In this document we do
   not explain the different mechanisms that can be put in place to
   detect the need of an IPv4 address in a Dual Stack node.  As required
   by DSTM, all TSP message exchanges take place in IPv6 using TCP
   transport.  Remark that exchanges between DSTM Servers and TEPs are
   not required if both functionalities are implemented in the same
   host.

   The allocation process greatly depends on a parameter called
   "Lifetime".  It specifies the time (in seconds) over which an IPv4
   address is assigned to a node, defining implicitly how often requests
   for allocation renewals are to be sent.

   TSP message exchange starts whenever a DSTM node requires an IPv4
   address.  The node may start the exchange, but it may also be
   possible that DSTM servers send Unsolicited Allocation messages to
   nodes.  This would be useful for implementations where it is allowed
   to originate connections from outside the DSTM domain (probably using
   a DNS-ALG).  The exact description of this possibility is outside the
   scope of this document.

   As shown in the figure, DSTM makes use of three types of TSP message:
   Create, Delete and Info.  'Tunnel Create' messages are sent by a DSTM
   node to ask for 4over6 Tunnel Configuration Parameters (implicitly
   including the request for a temporary IPv4 address).  The same type
   of message is used by the DSTM server to configure the TEP and by the
   DSTM node to ask for renewal of the allocation.  'Tunnel Info'
   messages are usually sent as a reply to a previous 'Tunnel Create'
   request.  Such a message may also be used to acknowledge the
   reception of a 'Tunnel Delete' command.  Finally, DSTM servers send
   'Tunnel Delete' messages to destroy 4over6 tunnels when the
   allocation time for an address expires.

2.1 Initial Address Allocation

   As described in TSP [2], the first phase in TSP involves
   authentication (which can be ANONYMOUS).  If authentication fails, an
   'Authentication Failure' error message (type 300) is generated and no



Blanchet, et al.        Expires December 30, 2002               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    DSTM IPv4 over IPv6 tunnel profile for Tunnel Setup Protocol(TSP)                                        July 2002


   address is allocated to the requesting node.  If authentication
   succeeds, TSP enters into command phase and the allocation process
   can take place.

   As shown on figure 2.1, the address allocation process starts when a
   DSTM node sends a 'Tunnel Create' request to the DSTM Server.  This
   message contains the Link-Local address of the node and the Global
   IPv6 address that the node would use to establish the 4over6 tunnel.
   No other information is needed.

   Next, the DSTM server processes the request.  It may result in an
   error due to Address Pool exhaustion (error type 306).  If an IPv4
   address is available, the server configures the TEP using another
   'Tunnel Create' message.  The message includes the global IPv6 and
   the allocated IPv4 addresses of the requesting node.

   The TEP MUST be configured to accept TSP messages only from a valid
   DSTM server.  At the arrival of a 'Tunnel Create' Request, the TEP
   updates its IPv4/IPv6 mapping table and sets up the 4over6 tunnel as
   requested.  If, for some reason, it is not possible to update the
   table, or the 4over6 tunnel cannot be set up, the TEP replies with an
   error message (error type 307).  In that case, the DSTM server SHOULD
   forward the error message to the requesting node.

   If tunnel configuration succeeds, the DSTM server receives a 'Tunnel
   Info' message from the TEP.  This message contains the IPv6 and IPv4
   addresses of the TEP for the new tunnel.

   At this point, the server updates its own tables and sends a 'Tunnel
   Info' message to the requesting node.  This message contains the
   temporary IPv4 address of the node, its period of validity (the 'Life
   Time') and address information of the TEP.  TEP information MUST be
   the same that the TEP provided.

   Finally, the IPv4 stack of the node is configured.  A 4over6 tunnel
   is established between the node and the TEP.  An IPv4 default route
   is added pointing to the 4over6 tunnel.  Communication in IPv4 can
   take place.  A timer configured with the 'Life Time' parameter
   informs the node when to ask for renewal of allocation, if needed.

2.2 Allocation Renewal

   As long as an IPv4 address is needed at the node, 'Tunnel Create'
   messages are sent to the DSTM Server as a request for allocation
   renewal.  The frequency of such requests depends on the 'Life Time'
   parameter.  The temporary IPv4 address for which allocation renewal
   is requested MUST be included in the messages.

   Based on the contents of the message and local policy, the server may
   reply with a 'Tunnel Info' message.  At the node, the reception of
   such a message means that allocation time has been extended: the
   timer is reset to the value contained in the 'Life Time' field.  No
   modification is needed in the IPv4 stack nor in the TEP.  If
   allocation cannot be extended, an error message MUST be sent to the
   node (error type 308) and tunnel information MUST be deleted at the
   TEP.

2.3 End of Allocation

   If properly configured, there will be a time where the node will no
   longer need an IPv4 address.  At this time, it will stop sending
   'Tunnel Create' requests for renewal.  At the server, when allocation
   time expires, a 'Tunnel Delete' message MUST be sent to both the node
   and the corresponding TEP.  The server SHOULD NOT wait for an
   acknowledge from the node before updating its own tables and deleting
   the configuration at the TEP.  However, implementations may wait
   until the server receives a reply before releasing the address.

   A 'Tunnel Delete' message contains the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the
   node for which the entry in the mapping table is to be deleted.  The
   TEP MUST stop forwarding packets for that node as a reaction to this
   type of message.  Depending on implementation, TEPs may acknowledge
   tunnel deletion using a 'Tunnel Info' message.

3. TSP Profile for DSTM

   This section describes the TSP profile for IPv4 over IPv6 tunnels in
   DSTM.

3.1 Overview

   The TSP profile uses the included DTD for the XML format of the
   message.  The DTD (c.f.  Annexe) contains the description of the
   tunnel XML message.  This message is used by a TSP-DSTM compliant
   server to provide the necessary information to DSTM nodes and the TEP
   in order to establish 4over6 tunnels.  Three types of action are
   defined in a 'tunnel' message: Create, Delete and Info.

   The 'Create' action is used to request a new tunnel or to renew an
   address allocation.

   The 'Delete' action is used by the server to remove an existing
   tunnel from a node and the TEP.

   The 'Info' action is used by the server to send tunnel configuration
   data.  It is also used by nodes and the TEP to acknowledge a previous

   command (Create or Delete).

   The 'tunnel' message may have one or two elements:

   o  client: Client's information

   o  server: Server's information

   Server is used in the context of the other party in the TSP
   connection.  It can be the DSTM server if the client is the DSTM
   node, or the TEP if the client is the DSTM server.

3.2 Client element

   The client element contains 'address' elements.  The 'address'
   element is used to identify the client IPv6 endpoint of the 4over6
   tunnel.  The client MUST send its link- local and global IPv6
   addresses to the server.  The server will then return a temporary
   IPv4 address inside the 'client' element when the tunnel is created
   or allocation is renewed.

3.3 Server element

   The 'server' element contains 'address' elements.  This element is
   used to identify the addresses at the TEP.  The 'address' element
   provides both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the TEP.

4. DSTM protocol using TSP

   TSP message exchanges are done using TCP over IPv6 transport.  Once
   the TCP session is established between the DSTM node and server, it
   MAY be kept connected for the duration of the address allocation
   lease time.  This TCP connection can be used by the server to send
   requests to the client on a communication channel already established
   (and potentially authenticated) by the client.

   This section presents an example of a DSTM host requesting an IPv4
   address allocation to a DSTM server.  As described in TSP[ref], the
   first TSP phase involves authentication (which can be ANONYMOUS)
   followed by a command phase that takes care of the allocation
   negotiation.

4.1 Initial Address Allocation

   Allocation Requests coming from a node consist of a 'tunnel' element
   using the attributes action set to 'create' and type set to 'v4v6'.
   The 'tunnel' element contains one 'client' element.

   element with the attribute 'action' set to 'info', 'type' set to
   'v4v6' and the 'lifetime' attribute set to the period of validity or
   lease time of the allocation.  The 'tunnel' element contains 'server'

4.2 Allocation Renewal

   a 'Tunnel Create' message to a DSTM server.  The request consists of
   a 'tunnel' element using the attributes action set to 'create' and

   If the allocation request is accepted, the DSTM server will
   acknowledge the renewal to the client by sending a 'tunnel' element
   with the attribute 'action' set to 'info', 'type' set to 'v4v6' and
   the 'lifetime' attribute set to the period of validity or lease time
   of the allocation.  No message is sent to the TEP in this case.  At
   the node, the reception of such a message means that allocation time
   has been extended; the timer is reset to the value contained in the
   'lifetime' field.

4.3 End of Allocation

   A DSTM server uses a 'Tunnel Delete' message to end the IPv4 address
   allocation of a client.  The release request consists of a 'tunnel'
   element using the attributes action set to 'delete' and type set to
   'v4v6'.  The 'tunnel' element contains 'server' and 'client' elements
   representing the address allocation that is released.

7. Security

   TSP provides authentication services using SASL [RFC2222].  If DSTM
   client authentication is required, TSP can be configured at the
   server to negotiate with the client the authentication scheme that
   will be used.

   In the context where the server sends a request to the client, some
   form of authentication is required so that the client can be sure
   that the request comes from a trusted DSTM server.

   This document proposes that in the case where the client initially
   authenticates to the DSTM server, this TCP session MAY be kept
   connected for the duration of the address allocation lease time.
   This TCP connection can be used by the server to send requests to the
   client on a communication channel already established by the client.
   A more secure solution would be to provide mutual authentication
   between the parties.
