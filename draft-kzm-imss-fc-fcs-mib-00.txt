Internet Draft       Fabric Configuration Server MIB      September 2005


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related
   to a Fibre Channel network's Fabric Configuration Server function
   which provides a means by which a management application can discover
   Fibre Channel fabric topology and attributes.  Discovered topology
   includes Interconnect Elements (i.e., switches, hubs, bridges, etc.)
   and their ports, as well as "platforms" which consist of one or more
   Fibre Channel nodes.

   At present, this memo is a work item of T11.5 (http://www.t11.org).
   The plan is that it will later be a work item of the IETF's IMSS
   working group.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel

   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point
   serial data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre Channel
   provides a general transport vehicle for higher level protocols such
   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-
   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet
   Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.

   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple
   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a
   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A
   Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may

Internet Draft       Fabric Configuration Server MIB      September 2005


   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are
   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch
   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single
   port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port
   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The
   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The
   term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A
   switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an
   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a
   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset
   of E_Port functionality.

   Many Fibre Channel components, including the fabric, each node, and
   most ports, have globally-unique names.  These globally-unique names
   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information
   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].  WWNs are expected to be persistent
   across agent and unit resets.

   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers which
   identify the frame's source and destination ports.  Each FC port has
   both an address identifier and a WWN.  When a fabric is in use, the
   FC address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.
   Each octet of a 24-bit address represents a level in an address
   hierarchy, with a Domain_ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.

   The Fibre Channel Fabric Configuration Server provides a way for a
   management application to discover Fibre Channel fabric topology and
   attributes.  The Fabric Configuration Server is designed so that it
   can be distributed among switches and it can be accessed from any
   Nx_Port.  However, the Fabric Configuration Server is not restricted
   or required to be part of/within a fabric.

   The information registered with and available from each Fabric
   Configuration Server is modelled as a fabric consisting of one or
   more Interconnect Elements, that each have some number of physical
   Ports, and one or more Fibre Channel nodes grouped together into
   Platforms to facilitate discovery and management.  The Ports are
   connected either to other Ports on other Interconnect Elements, or to
   Nx_Ports outside of the physical fabric.  Each Interconnect Element
   may have attributes including its name, type, Domain Identifier,
   Management Identifier, Logical Name, Management Address(es),
   Information List, Zoning Enforcement Status, etc.  Each Port may have
   attributes including its name, type, TX type, Module type, physical
   port number, attached port name(s), port state, speed, etc.

Internet Draft       Fabric Configuration Server MIB      September 2005


   The Fibre Channel Fabric Configuration Server is defined in the FC-GS
   specification.  The latest specification is [FC-GS-5].


4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel [RFC2837] was focussed
   on Fibre Channel switches.  It has been replaced by the more generic
   Fibre Channel Management MIB [FC-MGMT] which defines basic
   information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including
   extensions to the standard IF-MIB for Fibre Channel interfaces.

   This MIB extends beyond [FC-MGMT] to cover the functionality, in
   Fibre Channel switches, of providing Fibre Channel's Fabric
   Configuration Server function.

   This MIB imports some common Textual Conventions from T11-TC-MIB,
   defined in [FC-FAM-MIB].


5.  MIB Overview

   This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation of,
   and configuring some parameters of, one or more Fabric Configuration
   Servers (FCS) in a Fibre Channel (FC) network.  The capabilities
   provided include triggering a discovery of the configuration of one
   or more Fabrics, retrieving the results of such a discovery, as well
   as controlling and monitoring the operation of an FCS.  The
   discovered configuration contains information about:

   - Interconnect Elements (IEs), i.e., switches, hubs, bridges, etc.,
   - Ports on IEs, and
   - Platforms which consist of one or more FC nodes.

5.1.  Fibre Channel management instance

   A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [FC-MGMT] as a
   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.  Fibre
   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management
   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the
   implementation(s).  For example, one such grouping accommodates a
   single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with
   each sub-agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management
   instance.

Internet Draft       Fabric Configuration Server MIB      September 2005


   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB
   [FC-MGMT] as the index value to uniquely identify each Fibre Channel
   management instance within the same SNMP context ([RFC3411] section
   3.3.1).

5.2.  Switch Index

   The FC-MGMT-MIB [FC-MGMT] defines the fcmSwitchTable as a table of
   information about Fibre Channel switches which are managed by Fibre
   Channel management instances.  Each Fibre Channel management instance
   can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.  The Switch Index,
   fcmSwitchIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB as the index value
   to uniquely identify a Fibre Channel switch amongst those (one or
   more) managed by the same Fibre Channel management instance.

5.3.  Fabric Index

   [FC-SW-4] is the latest specification for an interconnecting Fabric
   consisting of multiple Fabric Switch elements.  It describes the
   operation of one or more Fabrics within one (or more) physical
   infrastructures.  With multiple fabrics, each fabric has its own
   management instrumentation.  Thus, this MIB defines all Fabric-
   related information in tables which are INDEX-ed by an arbitrary
   integer, named a "Fabric Index".  The syntax of a Fabric Index is
   T11FabricIndex, imported from T11-TC-MIB.

   In a Fabric conformant to [FC-SW-4], multiple Virtual Fabrics can
   operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures, and the Fabric
   index value is used to uniquely identify a particular (physical or
   virtual) fabric within a physical infrastructure.

   In a fabric conformant to versions of the specification earlier than
   FC-SW-4, only a single fabric could operate within a physical
   infrastructure, and for such cases, the Fabric index is defined to
   always be 1.

5.4.  The MIB Groups

   This section describes the six MIB groups contained in the MIB
   module.

5.4.1.  The t11FcsDiscoveredConfigGroup group

   This group contains the fabric configuration information discovered
   by Fabric Configuration Servers.

5.4.2.  The t11FcsDiscoveryStatusGroup group

   This group contains objects by which to monitor the status of
   discovery of fabric configurations by Fabric Configuration Servers."

5.4.3.  The t11FcsDiscoveryControlGroup group

   This group contains objects for requesting a Fabric Configuration
   Server to discover the configuration of one or more fabrics.

5.4.4.  The t11FcsStatisticsGroup group

   This group contains objects for Fabric Configuration Server
   statistics information.

5.4.5.  The t11FcsNotificationGroup group

   This group contains three notifications, generated when an FCS:

   - rejects a registration, deregistration or query request;
   - completes discovery on a range of fabrics;
   - learns that a management address of an Interconnect Element
      has changed.

5.4.6.  The t11FcsNotificationInfoGroup group

   This group contains notification control and notification information
   objects for monitoring Fabric Configuration Server request rejection
   and discovery of remote toplogy information.

11.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to make a MIB OID assignment under the appropriate
   subtree.

12.  Security Considerations

   There are several management objects defined in this MIB module with
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability is:

      t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeLow
      t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeHigh
      t11FcsFabricDiscoveryTimeOut
      t11FcsFabricDiscoveryStart -- the ability to specify parameters
                                    for, and trigger the start of,
                                    a topology discovery
      t11FcsDiscoveryStatus      -- the ability to abort a discovery, or
                                    invalidate discovered information.
      t11FcsReqRejectNotifyEnable
      t11FcsDiscoveryCompNotifyEnable
      t11FcsMgmtAddrChangeNotifyEnable -- the ability to enable/disable
                                          notifications.

   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  For example, the ability to invalidate
   discovered topology may afford an attacker the ability to hide the
   presence of unauthiorized equipment on the network.  The support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection
   can have a negative effect on network operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to

Internet Draft       Fabric Configuration Server MIB      September 2005


   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      t11FcsIeTable
      t11FcsMgmtAddrListTable
      t11FcsPortListTable
      t11FcsPortTable
      t11FcsAttachPortNameListTable
      t11FcsPlatformTable
      t11FcsNodeNameListTable -- contains information about the topology
                                 of the Fibre Channel network.

      t11FcsStatsTable -- contains statistics information about the
                          operation of the Fabric Configuration Server.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
