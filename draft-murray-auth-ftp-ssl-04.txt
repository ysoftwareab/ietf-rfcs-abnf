Internet-Draft            Secure FTP using TLS         27th August, 1998


1. Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism that can be used by FTP clients
   and servers to implement security and authentication using the TLS
   protocol defined by the IETF TLS working group and the extensions to
   the FTP protocol defined by the IETF CAT working group.  It describes
   the subset of the extensions that are required and the parameters to
   be used; discusses some of the policy issues that clients and servers
   will need to take; considers some of the implications of those
   policies and discusses some expected behaviours of implementations to
   allow interoperation.

   TLS is not the only mechanism for securing file transfer, however it
   does offer some of the following positive attributes:-

      - Flexible security levels.  TLS can support privacy, integrity,
      authentication or some combination of all of these.  This allows
      clients and servers to dynamically, during a session, decide on
      the level of security required for a particular data transfer,

      - Formalised public key management.  By use of X.509 public
      certificates during the authentication phase, certificate
      management can be built into a central function.  Whilst this may
      not be desirable for all uses of secured file transfer, it offers
      advantages in certain structured environments such as access to
      corporate data sources.

      - Co-existence and interoperation with authentication mechanisms
      that are already in place for the HTTPS protocol.  This allows web
      browsers to incorporate secure file transfer using the same
      infrastructure that has been set up to allow secure web browsing.

   The TLS protocol is a development of the Netscape Communication
   Corporation's SSL protocol and this document can be used to allow the
   FTP protocol to be used with either SSL or TLS.  The actual protocol
   used will be decided by the negotiation of the protected session by
   the TLS/SSL layer.

   Note that this specification is in accordance with the FTP RFC and
   relies on the TLS protocol and the CAT FTP security extensions.



2.  Introduction

   This document is an attempt to describe how three other documents
   should combined to provide a useful, interoperable, secure file
   transfer protocol.  Those documents are:-

Internet-Draft            Secure FTP using TLS         27th August, 1998


      RFC 959 [RFC-959]

         The description of the Internet File Transfer Protocol

      draft-ietf-tls-protocol-03.txt [TLS-DESC]

         The description of the Transport Layer Security protocol
         (developed from the Netscape Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
         protocol version 3.0).

      draft-ietf-cat-ftpsec-09.txt [CAT-FTPSEC]

         Extensions to the FTP protocol to allow negotiation of security
         mechanisms to allow authentication, privacy and message
         integrity.

   The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) currently defined in [RFC-959] and
   in place on the Internet is an excellent mechanism for exchanging
   files.  The security extensions to FTP in [CAT-FTPSEC] offer a
   comprehensive set of commands and responses that can be used to add
   authentication, integrity and privacy to the FTP protocol.  The TLS
   protocol is a popular (due to its wholesale adoption in the HTTP
   environment) mechanism for generally securing a socket connection.
   There are many ways in which these three protocols can be combined
   which would ensure that interoperation is impossible.  This document
   describes one method by which FTP can operate securely in such a way
   as to provide both flexibility and interoperation.  This necessitates
   a brief description of the actual negotiation mechanism (if used); a
   much more detailed description of the policies and practices that
   would be required and a discussion of the expected behaviours of
   clients and servers to allow either party to impose their security
   requirements on the FTP session.


3.  Audience

   This document is aimed at developers who wish to use TLS as a
   security mechanism to secure FTP clients and/or servers.


4.  Session negotiation on the control port

   4.1  Negotiated Session Security

      In this scenario, the server listens on the normal FTP control
      port {FTP-PORT} and the session initiation is not secured at all.
      Once the client wishes to secure the session, the AUTH command is
      sent and the server may then allow TLS negotiation to take place.



Carpenter, Ford-Hutchinson, Hudson & Murray                      [Page 4]





Internet-Draft            Secure FTP using TLS         27th August, 1998


    4.1.1  Client wants a secured session

        If a client wishes to attempt to secure a session then it
        should, in accordance with [CAT-FTPSEC] send the AUTH command
        with the parameter requesting TLS or SSL {TLS-PARM}.


        The client then needs to behave according to its policies
        depending on the response received from the server and also the
        result of the TLS negotiation.

    4.1.2  Server wants a secured session

        The FTP protocol does not allow a server to directly dictate
        client behaviour, however the same effect can be achieved by
        refusing to accept certain FTP commands until the session is
        secured to an acceptable level to the server.

    4.2  Implicit Session Security

      In this scenario, the server listens on a distinct port {FTP-
      TLSPORT} to the normal unsecured FTP server.  Upon connection, the
      client is expected to start the TLS negotiation.  If the
      negotiation fails or succeeds at an unacceptable level of security
      then it will be a client and/or server policy decision to
      disconnect the session.


5. Data Connection Behaviour

   The Data Connection in the FTP model can be used in one of three
   ways.  (Note: these descriptions are not necessarily placed in exact
   chronological order, but do describe the steps required.)

         i) Classic FTP client/server data exchange

         - The client obtains a port, sends the port number to the
         server, the server connects to the client.  The client issues a
         send or receive request to the server on the control connection
         and the data transfer commences on the data connection.

         ii) Firewall-Friendly client/server data exchange (as discussed
         in [FTP-SOCKS]) using the PASV command to reverse the direction
         of the data connection.

         - The client requests that the server open a port, the server
         obtains a port and returns it to the client.  The client
         connects to the server on this port.  The client issues a send



Carpenter, Ford-Hutchinson, Hudson & Murray                      [Page 5]





Internet-Draft            Secure FTP using TLS         27th August, 1998


         or receive request  on the control connection and the data
         transfer commences on the data connection.

         iii) Client initiated server/server data exchange (proxy or
         PASV connections)

         - The client requests that server A opens a port, server A
         obtains a port and returns it to the client.  The client sends
         this port number to server B.  Server B connects to server A.
         The client sends a send or receive request to server A and the
         complement to server B and the data transfer commences.  In
         this model server A is the proxy or PASV host and is a client
         for the Data Connection to server B.

   For i) and ii) the FTP client will be the TLS client and the FTP
   server will be the TLS server.

   That is to say, it does not matter which side initiates the
   connection with a connect() call or which side reacts to the
   connection via the accept() call, the FTP client as defined in [RFC-
   959] is always the TLS client as defined in [TLS-DESC].

   In scenario iii) there is a problem in that neither server A nor
   server B is the TLS client given the fact that an FTP server must act
   as a TLS server for Firewall-Friendly FTP [FTP-SOCKS].  Thus this is
   explicitly excluded in the security extensions document [CAT-FTPSEC],
   and in this document.



6. Mechanisms for the AUTH Command

   The AUTH command takes a single parameter to define the security
   mechanism to be negotiated.  As the SSL/TLS protocols self-negotiate
   their levels there is no need to distinguish SSL vs TLS in the
   application layer.  The proposed mechanism name for negotiating
   SSL/TLS will be the character string "TLS".  This will allow the
   client and server to negotiate SSL or TLS on the control connection
   without altering the protection of the data channel.  To protect the
   data channel as well, the PBSZ, PROT command sequence should be used.
   We call this "Explicit Data Channel Protection".

   However, there are clients and servers that exist today which use the
   string "SSL" to indicate that negotiation should take place on the
   control connection and that the data connection should be implicitly
   protected (i.e. the PBSZ 0, PROT P command sequence is not required
   but the client and server will protect the data channel as if it
   had). This is "Implicit Data Channel Protection" and is included



Carpenter, Ford-Hutchinson, Hudson & Murray                      [Page 6]





Internet-Draft            Secure FTP using TLS         27th August, 1998


   primarily for backward compatibility.

   To allow for streamlining of the negotiation, whilst allowing the
   "SSL" string to sink peacefully into disuse, the strings "TLS-P" and
   "TLS-C" will also be defined.  "TLS-C" will be a synonym for "TLS"
   and "TLS-P" a synonym for "SSL". Thus we allow for strict compliance
   with [CAT-FTPSEC] by use of "TLS" or "TLS-C" and a quicker (2 less
   commands) and perhaps more sensible option "TLS-P" which will
   implicitly secure the data connection at the same time as securing
   the control connection.

   Note: Regardless of the manner in which the data connection is
   secured (either implicitly by use of "TLS-P", "SSL" or connection to
   a well-known port for FTP protocol over TLS, or explicitly by use of
   the PBSZ/PROT sequence) the data connection state may be modified by
   the client issuing the PROT command with the new desired level of
   data channel protection and the server replying in the affirmative.
   This data channel protection negotiation can happen at any point in
   the session (even straight after a PORT or PASV command) and as often
   as is required.

      See also Section 12, "IANA Considerations".


7. SASL Considerations

   SASL is the Simple Authentication Security Layer. Currently, its
   definition can be found in the internet draft [SASL]. This document
   attempts to define the means by which a connection-based protocol may
   identify and authenticate a client user to a server, with additional
   optional negotiation of protection for the remainder of that session.

   Unfortunately, the SASL paradigm does not fit in neatly with the
   FTP-TLS protocol, mainly due to the fact that FTP uses two
   (independent) connections, and under FTP-TLS these may be at
   different (and possibly renegotiable) protection levels.
   Consequently, it is envisaged that SASL will sit underneath TLS on
   the control connection, and TLS (on both, either or neither
   connection) will be used for privacy and integrity (with optional
   authentication from TLS on either connection).


8. Data Connection Security

   The Data Connection security level is determined by two factors.

      1) The mechanism used to negotiate security on the control
      connection will dictate the default (i.e. un-negotiated) security



Carpenter, Ford-Hutchinson, Hudson & Murray                      [Page 7]





Internet-Draft            Secure FTP using TLS         27th August, 1998


      level of the data port.

      2) The PROT command, as specified in [CAT-FTPSEC] allows
      client/server negotiation of the security level of the data
      connection.  Once a PROT command has been issued by the client and
      accepted by the server, the security of subsequent data
      connections should be at that level until another PROT command is
      issued, the session ends, or the security of the session (via an
      AUTH command) is re-negotiated).

   Data Connection Security Negotiation (the PROT command)

      Note: In line with [CAT-FTPSEC], there is no facility for securing
      the Data connection with an insecure Control connection.

      The command defined in [CAT-FTPSEC] to negotiate data connection
      security is the PROT command.  As defined there are four values
      that the PROT command parameter can take.

         "C" - Clear - neither Integrity nor Privacy

         "S" - Safe - Integrity without Privacy

         "E" - Confidential - Privacy without Integrity

         "P" - Private - Integrity and Privacy

      As TLS negotiation encompasses (and exceeds) the
      Safe/Confidential/Private distinction, only Private (use TLS) and
      Clear (don't use TLS) are used.

      For TLS, the data connection can have one of two security levels.

         1) Clear

         2)Private

      With "Clear" protection level, the data connection is made without
      TLS at all.  Thus the connection is unauthenticated and has no
      privacy or integrity.  This might be the desired behaviour for
      servers sending file lists, pre-encrypted data or non-sensitive
      data (e.g. for anonymous FTP servers).

      If the data connection security level is 'Private' then a TLS
      negotiation must take place, to the satisfaction of the Client and
      Server prior to any data being transmitted over the connection.
      The TLS layers of the Client and Server will be responsible for
      negotiating the exact TLS Cipher Suites that will be used (and



Carpenter, Ford-Hutchinson, Hudson & Murray                      [Page 8]





Internet-Draft            Secure FTP using TLS         27th August, 1998


      thus the eventual security of the connection).


      In addition, the PBSZ (protection buffer size) command, as
      detailed in [CAT-FTPSEC], is compulsory prior to any PROT command.
      This document also defines a data channel encapsulation mechanism
      for protected data buffers.  For FTP-TLS, which appears to the FTP
      application as a streaming protection mechanism, this is not
      required.  Thus the PBSZ command must still be issued, but must
      have a parameter of "0" to indicate that no buffering is taking
      place and the data connection should not be encapsulated.

   Initial Data Connection Security

      For backward compatibility and ease of implementation the
      following rules govern the initial expected protection setting of
      the data connection.

         Connections accepted on the 'secure FTP' port (see
         {FTP-TLSPORT}).
            The initial state of the data connection will be "Private"
            (Although this does not follow [CAT-FTPSEC], this is how
            such clients tend to work today).

         Connections accepted on the normal FTP port {FTP-PORT} with
         TLS/SSL negotiated via an "AUTH SSL" command.
            The initial state of the data connection will be "Private"
            (Although this does not follow [CAT-FTPSEC], this is how
            such clients tend to work today).

         Connections accepted on the normal FTP port {FTP-PORT} with
         TLS/SSL negotiated via an "AUTH <Mechanism>" command.
            The initial state of the data connection will be "Clear"
            (this is the correct behaviour as indicated by [CAT-
            FTPSEC].)

      Note: Connections made on other ports may be still behave in one
      of these ways, but that will be a local configuration issue.


9. A Discussion of Negotiation Behaviour

   All these discussions assume that the negotiation has taken place by
   issuing the AUTH command with a mechanism that does not implicitly
   protect the data channel.  Using a mechanism which does implicitly
   secure the data channel or connecting to a port which is implicitly
   protected will have similar issues.




Carpenter, Ford-Hutchinson, Hudson & Murray                      [Page 9]





Internet-Draft            Secure FTP using TLS         27th August, 1998


   9.1. The server's view of the control connection

      A server may have a policy statement somewhere that might:

         - Deny any command before TLS is negotiated (this might cause
         problems if a SITE or some such command is required prior to
         login)
         - Deny certain commands before TLS is negotiated (such as USER,
         PASS or ACCT)
         - Deny insecure USER commands for certain users (e.g. not
         ftp/anonymous)
         - Deny secure USER commands for certain users (e.g.
         ftp/anonymous)
         - Define the level(s) of TLS/SSL to be allowed
         - Define the CipherSuites allowed to be used (perhaps on a per
         host/domain/...  basis)
         - Allow TLS authentication as a substitute for local
         authentication.
         - Define data connection policies (see next section)

         Note: The TLS negotiation may not be completed satisfactorily
         for the server, in which case it can be one of these states.

            The TLS negotiation failed completely

         In this case, the control connection should still be up in
         unprotected mode and the server should issue an unprotected 421
         reply to end the session.

            The TLS negotiation completed successfully, but the server
            decides that the session parameters are not acceptable (e.g.
            Distinguished Name in the client certificate is not
            permitted to use the server)

         In this case, the control connection should still be up in a
         protected state, so the server can either continue to refuse to
         service commands or issue a 421 reply and close the connection.

            The TLS negotiation failed during the TLS handshake

         In this case, the control connection is in an unknown state and
         the server should simply drop the control connection.

      Server code will be responsible for implementing the required
      policies and ensuring that the client is prevented from
      circumventing the chosen security by refusing to service those
      commands that are against policy.




Carpenter, Ford-Hutchinson, Hudson & Murray                     [Page 10]





Internet-Draft            Secure FTP using TLS         27th August, 1998


   9.2. The server's view of the data connection

      The server can take one of four basic views of the data connection

         1 - Don't allow encryption at all (in which case the PROT
         command should not allow any value other than 'C' - if it is
         allowed at all)
         2 - Allow the client to choose protection or not
         3 - Insist on data protection (in which case the PROT command
         must be issued prior to the first attempted data transfer)
         4 - Decide on one of the above three for each and every data
         connection

      The server should only check the status of the data protection
      level (for options 3 and 4 above) on the actual command that will
      initiate the data transfer (and not on the PORT or PASV).  The
      following commands cause data connections to be opened and thus
      may be rejected (before any 1xx) message due to an incorrect PROT
      setting.


         STOR
         RETR
         NLST
         LIST
         STOU
         APPE


      The reply to indicate that the PROT setting is incorrect is "521
      data connection cannot be opened with this PROT setting"
      If the protection level indicates that TLS is required, then it
      should be negotiated once the data connection is made.  Thus, the
      150 reply only states that the command can be used given the
      current PROT level.  Should the server not like the TLS
      negotiation then it will close the data port immediately and
      follow the 150 command with a 522 reply indicating that the TLS
      negotiation failed or was unacceptable.  (Note: this means that
      the application can pass a standard list of CipherSuites to the
      TLS layer for negotiation and review the one negotiated for
      applicability in each instance).

      It is quite reasonable for the server to insist that the data
      connection uses a TLS cached session.  This might be a cache of a
      previous data connection or of the control connection.  If this is
      the reason for the the refusal to allow the data transfer then the
      522 reply should indicate this.
      Note: this has an important impact on client design, but allows



Carpenter, Ford-Hutchinson, Hudson & Murray                     [Page 11]





Internet-Draft            Secure FTP using TLS         27th August, 1998


      servers to minimise the cycles used during TLS negotiation by
      refusing to perform a full negotiation with a previously
      authenticated client.

      It should be noted that the TLS authentication of the server will
      be authentication of the server host itself and not a user on the
      server host.

   9.3. The client's view of the control connection

      In most cases it is likely that the client will be using TLS
      because the server would refuse to interact insecurely.  To allow
      for this, clients must be able to be flexible enough to manage the
      securing of a session at the appropriate time and still allow the
      user/server policies to dictate exactly when in the session the
      security is negotiated.

      In the case where it is the client that is insisting on the
      securing of the session, it will need to ensure that the
      negotiations are all completed satisfactorily and will need to be
      able to inform the user sensibly should the server not support, or
      be prepared to use, the required security levels.

      Clients must be coded in such a manner as to allow the timing of
      the AUTH, PBSZ and PROT commands to be flexible and dictated by
      the server.  It is quite reasonable for a server to refuse certain
      commands prior to these commands, similarly it is quite possible
      that a SITE or quoted command might be needed by a server prior to
      the AUTH.  A client must allow a user to override the timing of
      these commands to suit a specific server.
      For example, a client should not insist on sending the AUTH as the
      first command in a session, nor should it insist on issuing a
      PBSZ, PROT pair directly after the AUTH.  This may well be the
      default behaviour, but must be overridable by a user.

      Note: The TLS negotiation may not be completed satisfactorily for
      the client, in which case it will be in one of these states:

            The TLS negotiation failed completely

            In this case, the control connection should still be up in
            unprotected mode and the client should issue an unprotected
            QUIT command to end the session.

            The TLS negotiation completed successfully, but the client
            decides that the session parameters are not acceptable (e.g.
            Distinguished Name in certificate is not the actual server
            expected)



Carpenter, Ford-Hutchinson, Hudson & Murray                     [Page 12]





Internet-Draft            Secure FTP using TLS         27th August, 1998


            In this case, the control connection should still be up in a
            protected state, so the client should issue a protected QUIT
            command to end the session.

            The TLS negotiation failed during the TLS handshake

            In this case, the control connection is in an unknown state
            and the client should simply drop the control connection.

   9.4. The client's view of the data connection

   Client security policies

      Clients do not typically have 'policies' as such, instead they
      rely on the user defining their actions and, to a certain extent,
      are reactive to the server policy.  Thus a client will need to
      have commands that will allow the user to switch the protection
      level of the data connection dynamically, however, there may be a
      general 'policy' that attempts all LIST and NLST commands on a
      Clear connection first (and automatically switches to Private if
      it fails).  In this case there would need to be a user command
      available to ensure that a given data transfer was not attempted
      on an insecure data connection.

      Clients also need to understand that the level of the PROT setting
      is only checked for a particular data transfer after that transfer
      has been requested.  Thus a refusal by the server to accept a
      particular data transfer should not be read by the client as a
      refusal to accept that data protection level in toto, as not only
      may other data transfers be acceptable at that protection level,
      but it is entirely possible that the same transfer may be accepted
      at the same protection level at a later point in the session.

      It should be noted that the TLS authentication of the client
      should be authentication of a user on the client host and not the
      client host itself.

10. Who negotiates what, where and how

   10.1. Do we protect at all ?

      Client issues AUTH <Mechanism>, server accepts or rejects.
      If server needs AUTH, then it refuses to accept certain commands
      until it gets a successfully protected session.

   10.2. What level of protection do we use ?

      Decided entirely by the TLS CipherSuite negotiation.

   10.3. Do we protect data connections in general ?

      Client issues PROT command, server accepts or rejects.


   10.4. Is protection required for a particular data transfer ?

      A client would already have issued a PROT command if it required
      the connection to be protected.
      If a server needs to have the connection protected then it will
      reply to the STOR/RETR/NLST/... command with a 522 indicating that
      the current state of the data connection protection level is not
      sufficient for that data transfer at that time.

   10.5. What level of protection is required for a particular data
   transfer ?

      Decided entirely by the TLS CipherSuite negotiation.

   Thus it can be seen that, for flexibility, it is desirable for the
   FTP application to be able to interact with the TLS layer upon which
   it sits to define and discover the exact TLS CipherSuites that are to
   be/have been negotiated and make decisions accordingly.  However it
   should be entirely possible, using the mechanisms described in this
   document, to have a TLS client or server sitting on top of a generic
   'TLS socket layer'.  In this case, interoperability for a client with
   a smart TLS-aware server may not be possible due to server policies.

Note: the order of the PBSZ/PROT pair and the USER/PASS pair (with
respect to each other) is not important (i.e. the USER/PASS can happen
prior to the PBSZ/PROT - or indeed the server can refuse to allow a
PBSZ/PROT pair until the USER/PASS pair has happened).

    Note: Implementors should be aware that then connect()/accept()
    function is performed prior to the receipt of the reply from the

    is performed after the reply from the aforementioned STOR has been
    dealt with.

12. Security Considerations

   This entire document deals with security considerations related to
   the File Transfer Protocol.


13. IANA Considerations

   {FTP-PORT} - The port assigned to the FTP control connection is 21.

   {FTP-TLSPORT} - A port to be assigned by the IANA for native TLS FTP
   connections on the control socket.  This has been provisionally
   reserved as port 990.

   {TLS-PARM} - A parameter for the AUTH command to indicate that TLS is
   required.  It is recommended that "TLS", "TLS-C", "SSL" and "TLS-P"
   (all uppercase only) are acceptable, and mean the following :-

      "TLS" or "TLS-C" - the TLS protocol or the SSL protocol will be
      negotiated on the control connection.  The default protection
      setting for the Data connection is "Clear".

      "SSL" or "TLS-P" - the TLS protocol or the SSL protocol will be
      negotiated on the control connection.  The default protection
      setting for the Data connection is "Private".


14. Network Management

   NONE


15. Internationalization

   NONE


16. Scalability & Limits

   There are no issues other than those concerned with the ability of
   the server to refuse to have a complete TLS negotiation for each and
   every data connection, which will allow servers to retain throughput
   whilst using cycles only when necessary.

Internet-Draft            Secure FTP using TLS         27th August, 1998


17. Applicability

   This mechanism is generally applicable as a mechanism for securing
   the FTP protocol.  It is unlikely that anonymous FTP clients or
   servers will require such security (although some might like the
   authentication features without the privacy).

A.  Summary of [TLS-DESC]

   The TLS protocol is developed by the IETF TLS working group.  It is
   based on the SSL protocol proposed by Netscape Communications
   Corporation.  The structure of the start of a TLS session allows
   negotiation of the level of the protocol to be used - in this way, a
   client or server can simultaneously support TLS and SSL and negotiate
   the most appropriate for the connection.

   The TLS protocol defines three security mechanisms that may be used
   (almost) independently.  They are Authentication, Integrity and
   Privacy.  It is possible to have an Authenticated session with no
   Privacy and with or without Integrity (useful for anonymous FTP
   sites, or sites with pre-encrypted data). For example, sessions with
   Authentication, Privacy and Integrity would be useful for control
   connections over an insecure network and data connections
   transferring confidential material.

   The TLS protocol allows unauthenticated sessions; server
   authentication or client and server authentication.  There is no
   mechanism for authenticating a client without first authenticating
   the server.

   The basic mechanism of the TLS protocol is that (for an
   Authenticated, Private session) asymmetric encryption is used to
   authenticate clients and servers and exchange a session key for
   symmetric encryption which is to be used for the rest of the session.

   The structure of the TLS session initialisation is that the client
   initiates the session with a "ClientHello" message.  The server will
   respond with a "ServerHello" and the session negotiation will
   continue.

   The TLS protocol allows session caching which is achieved by the
   client requesting that the server re-use a session context (Cipher
   Suite and symmetric key) in the ClientHello message.  There is no
   reason why a second connection could not request a 'cached' session
   with the same context as an existing session.

B.  Summary of [CAT-FTPSEC]



   Extensions to FTP

   The FTP Security Extensions document has 8 new commands to enhance
   the FTP protocol to allow negotiation of security and exchange of
   security data.  Three of these commands (the AUTH, PBSZ and PROT
   commands) are used by this document to allow an FTP client to
   negotiate TLS with the server.  The other commands are not required.

   i) AUTH

      This command is a request by the client to use an authentication
      and/or security mechanism.

      The client will issue an "AUTH <Mechanism>" command which will be
      a request to the server to secure the control connection using the
      TLS (or SSL) protocol. It also governs the initial protection
      setting of the data channel (which may be changed by a subsequent
      PROT command).

   ii) ADAT

      This command is used to transmit security data required by the
      security mechanism agreed in a preceding AUTH command.
      This document does not use the ADAT command.

   iii) PROT

      This command is used by the client to instruct the type of
      security that is required on the Data connection.

      The "PROT C" command will mean that TLS should not be used to
      secure the data connection; "PROT P" means that TLS should be
      used.  "PROT E" and "PROT S" are not defined and generate a 536
      reply from the server.

   iv) PBSZ

      This command is used to negotiate the size of the buffer to be
      used during secured data transfer.

      The PBSZ command must be issued prior to the PROT command.  The
      PBSZ command cannot be sent on an insecure control connection.
      For FTP and TLS the only valid value for the parameter is "0", all
      other values should receive a 200 reply with the text "PBSZ=0"

      included.

   v) CCC

      This command is used to specify that the control channel no longer
      requires protection.
      This document does not use the CCC command.

   vi) MIC

      This command is used to send a normal FTP command with integrity
      protection.
      This document does not use the MIC command.

   vii) CONF

      This command is used to send a normal FTP command with
      confidentiality protection (encrypted).
      This document does not use the CONF command.

   viii) ENC

      This command is used to send a normal FTP command with
      confidentiality and integrity protection.
      This document does not use the ENC command.
