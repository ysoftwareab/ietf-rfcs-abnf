Internet-Draft      Legacy Message Header Field Names         April 2005

1. Introduction

   [I1.RFC4021]provides registration templates for several Internet
   Message Format [I2.RFC822], [I3.RFC2822] header field names.
   However, there are more than a dozen message header field names which
   have been defined in published RFCs but which are not included in
   [I1.RFC4021].

   This memo provides registration templates for field names defined in
   early RFCs for use in Internet Message Format documents so as to
   preclude contradictory redefinition of those field names.  Messages
   may be kept in archives for long periods of time, and contradictory
   use of defined field names would be highly undesirable.  The
   registration templates are provided in accordance with [N1.BCP90].
