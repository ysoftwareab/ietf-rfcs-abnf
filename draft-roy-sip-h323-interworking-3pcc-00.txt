                                 Abstract

   This contribution describes a generalized interworking mechanism
   between SIP and H.323 for third party call control where the
   controller function can reside anywhere within the IP Telephony
   network. The proposed generalized interworking mechanism offers
   transparent IP Telephony services between the SIP and H.323
   endpoints considering the third party call control function resides
   in a separate application server. The implementation of the third
   party call control function on a SIP proxy, SIP endpoint, H.323 GK,
   H.323 endpoint, MCU, or IWF is a special case of the generalized
   mechanism proposed in this document.

1. Introduction

   The work for the third party call control [2] using Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [3] is in near completion. The third party
   call control mechanism in H.323 [4] can also be done. The work for
   SIP-H.323 Interworking standard [5] that is defining the Interowking
   Function (IWF) for providing transparent communications between the
   SIP and H.323 users is also progressing. Recently, a mechanism has
   been defined for interworking of the third party call control [6]
   between SIP and H.323 using IWF as the controller that can be termed
   as one of the implementation schemes.


   We are considering that the third party call control mechanism will
   be able to reside anywhere within the SIP-based or H.323-based IP
   Telephony network including the IWF. To provide a generalized
   solution, we have considered that the third party call control
   application will reside in a separate application server that
   provides the transparent services among the SIP and H.323 users.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [7].


3. Call Control Applications

   The application which is responsible for the call control is known
   as the call control application. A call control application can be
   termed as the first party application or third party application
   depending on how the call is controlled.


3.1 First Party Call Control Application

   The application which is responsible for call control also becomes a
   party in the call that is being controlled is termed as the first
   party application. For example, a first party application will
   operate locally for the controlled terminal when it is one of the
   parties in the call. The call control application can use a SIP user
   agent (UA) or H.323 terminal/endpoint (EP) to initiate a call to
   another SIP UA or H.323 terminal/EP, and if the call control
   application and its users become a party for communication in this
   call that is being controlled, it is termed as the first party call
   control application.

3.2 Third Party Call Control Application

   A third party call control application performs actions on calls,
   but the controlling application itself is not a party of the
   controlled call. The third party application is also termed as the
   controller and allows to set up calls among two or more than two
   parties. If needed, it can also manage the communication
   relationship among the communicating parties.

   It has the ability to perform all of the call control functions that
   a first party call control application does. The third party
   application can run on a separate application server, on a SIP
   proxy, on an H.323 GK, on an MCU, on a SIP terminal, on an H.323
   terminal, on an IWF, or on other terminals. Typical third party call
   control applications are media server, conferencing server, call
   center, click-to-dial, mid-call announcement, and group control
   applications.


4. SIP-H.323 Interworking and Third Party Call Control

4.1 SIP-H.323 Interworking Architecture

   An IWF [5] is used for interconnection between the SIP- and H.323-
   based IP Telephony network to provide seamless communications among
   all users. The SIP-side of the IWF works, as if, as a SIP signaling
   entity while the H.323-side of the IWF works as an H.323 signaling
   entity. Basically, IWF provides the conversion between the SIP [3]
   and H.323 [4] signaling protocol. However, media is sent directly
   between the SIP and H.323 entities directly.

   Figure 1 shows a high-level configuration for SIP-H.323
   Interworking. There can be more that one IWF interconnecting the
   SIP- and H.323-based IP Telephony network. Similarly, there can be a
   single or multiple GKs or MCUs in the H.323 system. In the same
   token, a single or multiple SIP proxies or MCUs can reside in the
   SIP system.



             ---------   -------        ------   -------
             | Proxy |   | MCU |        | GK |   | MCU |
             ---+-----   ---+---        ---+--   ---+---
                |           |              |        |
   SIP          |           |              |        |      H.323
   Endpoints    |           |              |        |  Endpoints
            +---+-----------+--+       +---+--------+---+

   Figure 1: SIP-H.323 Interworking Architecture

   It may so happen that both SIP and H.323 IP Telephony services can
   be owned by a single service provider. In other situations, SIP
   services are provided by one service provider while H.323 services
   are provided by another service provider. In the case of multiple
   service providers, there may have to be some kind of service level
   agreement (SLA) how the third party calls will be handled and
   managed.


4.2 Third Party Call Control Applications

   The third party call control applications are usually installed in
   the application server. However, they can also be installed in
   proxies, GKs, and MCUs including IWFs when these entities are
   equipped with the third party call control application features.
   There may be some complications when the third party call
   applications need to initiate calls among multiple parties where
   some parties may involve both SIP and H.323 users while others may
   only be either for SIP users or for H.323 users. In those
   situations, more complicated call scenarios need to be worked out
   for SIP-H.323 interworking. We will analyze each situation case by
   case basis. Some of the scenarios may not be addressed now because
   the SIP standard is yet to work out for all scenarios.

   However, we are assuming that the third party call control
   application will maintain the call states for the duration of the
   call in order to manage the call.


5. Third party Call Control in the Context of SIP-H.323 Interworking

   We are assuming that the third party call control application that
   controls and manages calls reside anywhere in the network. However,
   we are considering a separating application server where the third
   party call control application resides. It will provide a
   generalized solution for the SIP-H.323 interworking.


   In a more complicated scenario, it may so happen that some of the
   users may have sub-conferencing among the parties of SIP or H.323
   users only in addition to the primary conferencing that consists of
   both SIP and H.323 users. These kinds of scenarios require further
   work in SIP standard and will not be addressed here.

   Radhika R. Roy                                             [Page 6]

Internet Draft            3pcc Interworking           February 22, 2002




   We will consider SIP RFC 2543 [3] and H.323 Version [2] for
   interworking first for the third party interworking. We will then
   consider the revised SIP RFC 2543-bis07 (or its updated version), if
   there are any differences that we may need to make. Similarly, the
   subsequent versions of H.323 will also be considered accordingly as
   appropriate.

   However, the third party call control application server capability
   may be implemented to a SIP proxy, an H.323 GK, an MCU, or an IWF to
   act as the controller. These solutions will be a matter of
   implementation of the generalized interworking mechanisms described
   here.


5.1 SIP Third Party Call Control

   The SIP third party call control (3pcc) draft [2] provides the
   baseline how the 3pcc is required to be implemented. If this draft
   is finalized and accepted, the 3pcc will be implemented using the
   two types of call flows: Case A. Second entity other than the human
   being is known to the controller and answers the call immediately
   and Case B. Endpoints are not known to the controller or the second
   endpoint can be a human being.

   Figure 1 (Flow 1 _ Figure 1 [2] and Flow 4 - Figure 4 [2]) shows the
   flow for Case A when the controller sends an INVITE to the first SIP
   user and knows that the second SIP entity which will communicate
   with the first entity will answer the call immediately (e.g., an
   automata like a media server, conferencing server).


           A                Controller            B
           |                   |                  |

   Figure 2: SIP Third Party Call Control Flows: Second Entity other
   than the Human being Known to Controller and Answers Immediately
   (Flows 1 - Figure 1 [2] and Flow 4 - Figure 4 [2])

   The flow in Figure 2 does not require the SDP manipulation by the
   controller and works for any media types supported by both
   endpoints. It is assumed that the second endpoint (e.g., Entity B)
   will be like a media server, conference server or other entity (but
   not people) that will answer the call immediately. Otherwise, it
   will have timeout problems because it will cause A to retransmit the
   200 OK response periodically.

   Figure 3 (Flow 3 _ Figure 3 [2] and Flow 4 - Figure 4 [2]) shows the
   flows when the controller does not know SIP entities or if calls are
   made to entities that represent people.

   Figure 3: SIP Third Party Call Control Flows: Entities are Unknown
   to the Controller or Second Entity is a Human Being (Flow 3 _ Figure
   3 [2] and Flow 4 - Figure 4 [2])

   The above flow (Figure 3) solves the timeout problems (it still may
   happen if re-INVITE is not responded to quickly), does not require
   the controller to guess the media that will be used by the
   participants, or does not assume that a device responds properly to
   an INVITE with SDP on hold.

   However, the drawbacks of this flow (Figure 3) are: A. Needs to
   perform SDP manipulations (e.g., takes some SDP and generates
   another SDP which has the same media composition, but is on hold) by
   the controller and B. Needs to reorder an SDP X so that its media
   line match up with those in some other SDP Y.

   Flows shown in Figures 2 and 3 will indicate that the From field is
   of the controller and each communicating endpoint will assume that
   it is in a point-to-point call with the controller. So, the
   controller will have the complete control of the call. If the
   controller receives a BYE from an endpoint, it can also create a new
   BYE and hang up with the other participant.

   It is interesting to note that the controller can also add, remove,
   transfer, and so on another endpoint if one endpoint sends BYE after
   establishment of the call.


5.1.1 Implementation of SIP Third Party Call Controller

   A SIP user agent (UA) will be sufficient to implement the features
   of the controller. All UA features may not need to be implemented

   Radhika R. Roy                                             [Page 9]

Internet Draft            3pcc Interworking           February 22, 2002



   for acting as the controller. A user agent server (UAS) should be
   sufficient to implement the controller functions [2].  However, it
   is also possible for the controller to take ownership of a call
   setup by a different party by acting as a back-to-back UA (B2BUA)
   and the call flows will be little different than those shown in
   Figures 2 and 3 when the controller acts as the B2BUA [2].

   There can also be SIP proxies in addition to endpoints and
   controller. The call flows will still remain the same because
   stateful or stateless proxies will be routing the signaling messages
   among the endpoints and controllers. If the controller function is
   implemented to a SIP proxy, the call flows will still remain the
   same. The only difference may be that some fields within the SIP
   signaling messages may be modified for routing while it will be
   functioning as a proxy in addition to the controller role.


5.1.2 SIP Third party Call Management

   The third party controller itself invites the participants and
   control the calls for establishment, modify, and terminate the
   calls. The controller itself becomes the SIP entity and it is
   desired to register itself. In turn, it is also desired to get
   access to the SIP REGISTRATION server, possibly through a location
   server [8-10], to know the actual addresses, as opposed to the
   logical addresses, of the participants.

   The controller itself also needs to identify who it is and why it is
   doing so. SIP [3] provides mechanisms for authentication, but
   nothing is specified why a third party controller is trying to
   establish the call. A separate work (e.g., service level agreement
   [SLA] in the case of multi-carrier environment) is needed at the
   time of service provisioning that a third party call control is
   allowed.


5.2 H.323 Third Party Call Control

   Like SIP, H.323 third party call control application will also have
   the same capabilities to control and manipulate the call. The
   important point is that H.245 is used to media control where the
   capability negotiation is very powerful. The implementation of the
   third party call control in H.323 is cleaner and straightforward
   and, unlike SIP, no assumption is required whether an endpoint is
   human or priori known non-human to avoid the timeout or media
   control/manipulation problems. However, the complex negotiation
   takes too many round trips.

   Figure 4: H.323 Third Party Call Control (TCS = Terminal Capability
   Set, MSD = Master Slave Determination, OLC = Open Logical Channel,
   CLC = Close Logical Channel)


5.2.1 Implementation of H.323 Third Party Call Controller

   The flow of Figure 4 clearly shows that the controller needs to
   understand H.323 signaling messages. From implementation point of
   view, a controller at least needs to be aware of H.225.0 Q.931/932
   and H.245 signaling messages. Indirectly, it has to act almost like
   an H.323 endpoint that does not deal with H.225.0 RAS signaling
   messages and RTP media streams. However, it seems to be prudent to
   implement H.225.0 RAS in the controller as well so that it can take
   advantages of the services that GKs provide specially for the large-
   scale network.

   If there are GKs, the call flows will still remain the same, but the
   controller needs to be the aware of the H.225.0 RAS signaling

   Radhika R. Roy                                            [Page 12]

Internet Draft            3pcc Interworking           February 22, 2002



   messages so that a GK will be able to know there is an H.323
   controller at the time of registration. However, this will require
   additional signaling messages between the controller and the GK
   should any resources need to be reserved/released (e.g., messages
   like ARQ/ACF/ARJ and DRQ/DCF/DRJ) in addition to the endpoints and
   have not been shown in Figure 4.


5.2.2 H.323 Third Party Call Management

   Like SIP, H.323 third party controller itself also invites the
   participants and controls the calls for establishment, modification,
   and termination of the calls. The controller itself becomes the
   H.323 entity and it is desired to register itself.

   Like SIP, the controller itself also needs to identify who it is and
   why it is doing so. H.323 [4] provides mechanisms for
   authentication. As mentioned earlier, a separate work (e.g., service
   level agreement [SLA] in the case of multi-carrier environment) is
   needed at the time of service provisioning that a third party call
   control is allowed.

   So, the controller needs to register with a GK in order to
   participate in the H.323 services. Before registration of the GK, a
   controller needs to discover who will be the GK. H.323/H.225.0 RAS
   protocol has discovery and registration services using GRQ/GCF/GRJ
   and RRQ/RCF/RRJ messages, respectively. The controller can have
   these services using H.225.0 RAS protocol.

   In order to set up the communications among the participants, a
   controller needs to obtain the actual addresses, as opposed to the
   logical addresses, of the participants before the setup of the call.
   In addition, a controller may also need to reserve the bandwidth
   resources for the participants. The controller can use the
   ARQ/ACF/ARJ and other messages of H.225.0 RAS protocol for
   registration, admission, address translation, bandwidth reservation,
   call management, and other purposes.


5.3 SIP-H.323 Interworking Third Party Call Control

   The third party call controller can be placed anywhere in the SIP-
   or H.323-based IP Telephony network either as a separate entity or
   as a part in conjunction with SIP proxy, H.323 GK, MCU, or IWF. We
   are assuming that there is a single third party call controller that
   provides seamless services to both SIP and H.323 endpoints. The
   situation can be such that there are two third party controllers:
   One in SIP-based IP Telephony network while the other one is in the
   H.323-based IP Telephony network. In this case, the interworking


   Radhika R. Roy                                            [Page 13]

Internet Draft            3pcc Interworking           February 22, 2002



   between the two controllers is also needed, and we are not
   considering this situation in this document.


5.3.1 Two-Party Call: SIP and H.323 Endpoint

   We are considering the case where two endpoints, one in the SIP-
   based IP Telephony network while the other one in H.323 side, will
   be communicating and the controller will help to set up the call
   between the endpoints. The controller can be located anywhere and
   there can be many scenarios for interworking based on the location
   of the controller as follows:

     A. Third party call controller in the SIP-based IP telephony
     network (First endpoint in the SIP side while the second endpoint
     in the H.323 side)

        A.1 Initially INVITE without SDP sent to the SIP endpoint first
        (assumption): Second endpoint located in the H.323 side known
        (may be pre-provisioned with non-human endpoint like media
        server, conferencing server, or other) to the controller and
        the controller expects that this entity will answer the call
        immediately without causing any spurious retransmissions or
        timeouts in the SIP side

                A.1.1  If the IWF does not set up the call to the H.323
                side priori

                A.1.2 If the IWF sets up the call to the H.323 side
                priori

        A.2 Initially INVITE without SDP sent to the SIP endpoint first
        (assumption): Second endpoint located in the H.323 side and the
        answering behavior of the H.323 side is not known (e.g., human
        user) to the controller so that that the delay for response in
        the H.323 side should not cause timeout in the SIP side

                A.2.1 If the IWF does not set up the call to the H.323
                side priori

                A.2.2 If the IWF sets up the call to the H.323 side
                priori

        A.3 Initially INVITE without SDP sent to the H.323 endpoint
        first (assumption): Second endpoint located in the SIP side

   B. Third party call controller in the H.323-based IP telephony
   network



   Radhika R. Roy                                            [Page 14]

5.3.1.2 Third Party Call Control Application in the SIP-based IP
Telephony Network

   Figure 1 shows that IWF interconnects the SIP- and H.323-based IP
   Telephony network. We are assuming that the first endpoint resides
   in the SIP side while the second endpoint is the H.323 side.


5.3.1.2.1 H.323 Endpoint other than human being Known to the Controller
Answers the Call Immediately

   If the behavior of the H.323 endpoint is known to the controller
   along with its media capabilities, the controller can then deal with
   the unknown SIP endpoint easily in accordance with its media
   capabilities that are not known to the controller.


5.3.1.2.1.1 Controller does Not Setup the Call to the H.323 side Priori
via IWF

   The key point of this flow (Figure 5) is that the controller knows
   that the behavior of the H.323 endpoint will not cause spurious
   transmissions or timeouts to the SIP side before sending the final
   response ACK. In addition, when SDP of the SIP endpoint is sent to
   the controller, the controller will be able to determine whether the
   media capabilities will be supported by the H.323 endpoint or not.

   A.


5.3.1.2.1.2 Controller Sets Up the Call to the H.323 side Priori via
IWF

   The only benefit of this flow (Figure 6) compared to that of the
   earlier flow (Figure 5) is that there is a some saving in time to se
   up the connection in the H.323 side. As a result, the relatively
   less delay in the call set up time to the H.323 side will help not
   to cause spurious transmissions or timeouts to the SIP side.

   Figure 6: H.323 Endpoint other than a Human being: Controller Sets
   Up the Call to the H.323 side Priori via IWF

   The detail description for each message flow may be seen in Appendix
   A.


5.3.1.2.2 H.323 Endpoint not Known to the Controller or Entities
Represent People

   If the both SIP and H.323 endpoint are not known to the controller,
   the flow needs to be carefully handled to manipulate the media
   capabilities in the SDP of the SIP side.


5.3.1.2.2.1 Controller Does Not Setup the Call to the H.323 side Priori
via IWF

   The controller does not know both endpoints and the flow shown in
   Figure 7 needs to be manipulated by the controller carefully in the
   SIP side to have the same common capability to the both sides. The
   controller must take some SDP and generates another SDP which has
   the same media composition, but is on hold. The controller may need

   to reorder the SDP B, so that its media lines match up with those in
   some other SDP B'.

   However, the advantage of this flow is that it does not cause any
   spurious transmissions or timeouts. It does not require the
   controller to guess the media that will be used by the participants.
   Most importantly, this flow does not assume that a device responds
   properly to an INVITE with SDP on hold and, consequently, the long
   call setup time to the H.323 side will not cause any problems to the
   SIP side.

5.3.1.2.3 Fast Connect to the H.323 Endpoint: SIP Endpoint

   The fast call setup in the H.323 side will reduce the call setup
   time significantly for all cases what have described earlier (Flows
   of Figures 5-8).

   Figure 9 shows the flow when the fast call setup is made to the
   H.323 side. It clearly shows that it will reduce the probability of
   the spurious retransmissions or timeouts to the SIP side. This flow
   is recommended when it is possible to implement.

   Figure 9: Fast Call Setup to the H.323 side: H.323 Endpoint other
   than a Human being

   The other scenarios for the H.323 fast call setup can also be
   described case by case basis. We will address those flows in
   separate Internet drafts.


5.3.1.2.4 Tunneling to the H.323 Endpoint: SIP Endpoint Known/Unknown
to the Controller

   These scenarios will also be addressed in separate Internet drafts.
   However, it may be mentioned that the H.323 tunneling mechanisms
   will also reduce the overall call setup time. However, it will not
   reduce the call setup time as much it is done using the fast call
   setup.


5.3.1.3 Third Party Call Control Application in the H.323-based IP
Telephony Network

   The flow scenarios for this case when the controller is placed to
   the H.323 side are similar what has been described earlier in the
   case when the controller is placed in the SIP side. The detail call
   flows will be described later.

5.3.2 Multi-Party Call

   The multi-party call scenarios will be addressed later as SIP's
   standards for conferencing are still to be addressed while the
   conferencing standards for H.323 have been completed sometime ago.


6.  Third Party Call Control Service Transparency for SIP-H.323
Interworking

   The third party call control mechanisms proposed here will provide
   service transparency for both SIP and H.323 endpoints. The
   controller can be placed in any IP Telephony network whether it uses
   SIP or H.323 protocol. The functionality of the controller can be
   implemented over a separate server residing in a SIP- or H.323-based
   IP Telephony network, SIP Proxy, SIP Endpoint, H.323 GK, H.323
   Endpoint, or SIP-H.323 IWF. The transparent third party call control
   requires several services for working in the SIP-H.323 interworking
   environment.


6.1 Location of the Third Party Controller

6.1.1 Controller Located in SIP Side

   The controller can be in either SIP- or H.323-based IP Telephony
   network. If the controller is in the SIP side of the IP Telephony
   network, it address will be SIP URL as specified in SIP RFC 2543
   [2]. When controller needs to establish calls among the participants
   of both SIP and H.323 endpoints transparently, its SIP URL needs to
   be a common address space that can be mapped between SIP URL and
   H.323 alias address as specified in SIP-H.323 Interworking standard
   [5]. So, when the controller uses SIP URL of a participant and that
   participant remains in the H.323 side, the call will be routed via
   SIP-H.323 IWF. The IWF will then map the SIP URL to the H.323 alias
   address and route the call to the H.323 endpoint.

   One interesting problem is that there may be many SIP-H.323 IWFs
   between SIP and H.323 system and a given IWF is the keeper of
   addresses of many SIP and H.323 endpoints. A controller being in the
   SIP side or a SIP proxy on behalf of the controller needs to select
   the appropriate IWF to route the call. Although the SIP side of an
   IWF will be able to act as a SIP UA that can register only one SIP
   URL. SIP does not have the mechanism to register all the addresses
   that an IWF keeps. So, separate mechanisms [9, 10] are needed for
   discovery of the IWF and registration of the addresses (SIP URL,
   H.323 alias address) by the IWF to the location server/SIP proxy.




   Radhika R. Roy                                            [Page 22]

Internet Draft            3pcc Interworking           February 22, 2002



6.1.2 Controller Located in the H.323 Side

   If a controller is in the H.323 side of the network, it will do the
   similar thing as it has been described when it remains in the SIP
   side. The controller will use the H.323 alias addresses for both SIP
   and H.323 participants. For the endpoint that is located in the SIP
   side, the call will be sent via an IWF that will convert the H.323
   alias address to a SIP URL assuming that the alias address will be
   one of the addresses of the common subset both SIP URLs and H.323
   alias addresses as specified in SIP-H.323 Interworking standard [5].

   The important difference is that the H.323 side of the IWF will be
   able to work as the H.323 GW. Unlike SIP, an H.323 GW will also be
   able to discover the H.323 GK and can register all the H.323 alias
   addresses to a GK. As a result, a controller itself or a controller
   with the help of a GK will be able to select the appropriate IWF to
   route a call to the SIP side.


6.2 Address Resolution

   The actual addresses of the controller and participants need to be
   known irrespective of the fact that some parties will be in the SIP
   side while others will be in the H.323 side of the network. For
   example, the SIP URL provided in the contact becomes the actual
   address of the SIP participant. In H.323, the alias address of the
   H.323 participant becomes the actual address. DNS and/or other
   mechanisms can be used to map the actual address to the physical
   address where necessary.

   However, a SIP-H.323 IWF [5] is used to map between the SIP URL and
   H.323 alias address when the call is routed from the SIP to the
   H.323 side and vice versa.


6.3 Accounting, Authentication, and Authorization

   Participants need to know that they will be asked to accept the call
   from the third party controller and there should be an established
   standard mechanism how to perform billing or accounting in addition
   to authentication and authorization. The key point is that the
   controller is not a direct party between the communicating
   endpoints. Rather, it facilitates the communications among the
   participants. As a result, each party knows that each one is
   communicating with the controller with a point-to-point logical mode
   although the media goes directly between the participants. The
   controller is not a direct party among the participants so far the
   media is concerned.



   Radhika R. Roy                                            [Page 23]

Internet Draft            3pcc Interworking           February 22, 2002



   The third party role of the controller raises an important issue how
   to deal with billing, authentication, and authorization. If both SIP
   and H.323 system belongs to the same service provider, the situation
   is not so complicated. If there are different service providers for
   the SIP- and H.323-based IP Telephony, the situation becomes more
   complicated.

   A careful observation will reveal the fact that there is a complete
   transparency between the SIP and H.323 system because both use the
   same RTP media stream and both SIP and H.323 endpoints can send RTP
   media streams directly once the call is set up using two dissimilar
   SIP and H.323 signaling protocols.

   It implies that all issues related to the authentication,
   authorization, and accounting (AAA) need to resolved at the time of
   call setup.

   Both SIP and H.323 have their own authentication and authorization
   mechanisms. An interworking between these two systems for security
   also needs to be addressed. The SIP-H.323 Interworking [5] is yet to
   be worked out for this standard. Similar is the case for
   interworking of the accounting. Once the interworking for security
   and accounting standard are developed, the same can be used to
   develop the standard for the third party call control with
   transparency between SIP and H.323 endpoints.


6.4 Bandwidth Management

   H.323 has the mechanisms to provide bandwidth reservation for both
   pre-call setup and call setup time. So, H.323 endpoints can have the
   opportunity to have the guaranteed bandwidth for the H.323 side of
   the call. However, there is no standard defined in SIP FRC 2543 [3]
   how SIP endpoints can have the opportunity to reserve the bandwidth
   either during the pre-call setup or during the call setup time. As a
   result, there will be no standard mechanism that will provide
   complete transparency for both SIP and H.323 endpoints for the third
   party call control.

   The subsequent SIP RFC 2543-bis07 (or its updated version) may take
   care of the bandwidth reservation during the call setup time, but
   there still new works needs to be done in the SIP side how the
   bandwidth can be reserved during the pre-call setup time as it is
   done using ARQ/ACF/ARJ messages in the case of H.225.0 RAS to make
   the transparent SIP-H.323 interworking.

6.5 Media Control

   SIP uses SDP as a message body to manipulate media while H.323 uses
   H.245 protocol for control of media. However, the third party
   controller does not have the media information of the participants
   in priori. A controller needs to initiate communications with each
   party in such a way, as if, each participate believes that it is in
   point-to-point communications mode with the controller although
   media goes directly between the participants bypassing the
   controller.

   The above communication mode requires that the controller needs to
   initiate communications in such a way that will force the
   participant to respond with its media capabilities although the
   controller does not know the media capability of the participant
   priori. In SIP, the controller sends the INVITE message to a
   participant without SDP and, in turn, the controller responds with
   its media capability in SDP. Then the controller sends the same SDP
   of the participant to the other participant. The communication for
   negotiation of media among the participants is done via the
   controller. In this way, a controller helps to establish the call so
   that media can be sent directly between the participants.

   In H.323, as we have proposed, a controller starts media
   negotiations by sending the empty terminal capability set (TCS) to
   the participant. In turn, the participant sends its own TCS and the
   same TCS of the participant is sent to the other participant. Then
   the controller helps to negotiate media so that the media can go
   directly among the participants.

   The above generic principle of the controller is applicable whether
   the controller is in the SIP side or in the H.323 side. However,
   when SDP goes from the SIP side to the H.323 side and vice versa, a
   mapping needs to be done between SDP and H.245 messages within the
   IWF as defined in the SIP-H.323 Interworking standard [6]. The
   important point is that the signaling messages will be going through
   the controller. That is, the controller's address also needs to be
   registered to the IWF. There are some issues in discovery of the IWF
   and registration of the SIP URL with the SIP side of the IWF and the
   suggested solution has been described in other internet drafts [9,
   10].


6.6 Discovery

   Like the discovery of the IWFs and GKs in H.323, it is also seen
   that the discovery of the IWFs and SIP proxies/Location servers is
   needed in the SIP side if one needs to use the third party call
   control services transparently across both SIP and H.323 IP
   Telephony services. The discovery mechanism for IWFs and SIP

   Radhika R. Roy                                            [Page 25]

Internet Draft            3pcc Interworking           February 22, 2002



   proxies/Location servers can be done as proposed in another Internet
   draft [9].


6.7 Registration

   We have discussed the difficulty of registration of the IWF in SIP.
   An IWF will be the keeper of 100s and 1000s of SIP URLs. However, a
   IWF can register only one SIP URL acting as a single SIP UA. Unlike
   H.323, the IWF can not advertise the SIP URLs of all other endpoints
   to the SIP proxies/location servers in the SIP side that can be
   reachable through it. The registration mechanism for IWFs to the SIP
   proxies/Location servers can be done as proposed in another Internet
   draft [10].


6.8 Policy

   A third party call controller will be able to apply its independent
   policy to initiate calls to the participants as a third party
   whether it is located in the SIP-side or in the H.323 side of the IP
   Telephony network. The policy of the controller will also be
   dependent whether both SIP- and H.323-side of the IP Telephony
   network is controlled by the same service provider or different
   service providers. The accounting, authentication, and authorization
   services of the third party calls will be highly dependent on the
   policy of the controller. The detail discussion of the policy of the
   third party controller will done in separate Internet drafts.


7. Conclusion

   In this contribution, we have discussed a generalized third party
   call control mechanism that provides transparent services over the
   both SIP- and H.323-based IP Telephony network assuming that SIP-
   H.323 IWFs will be used to provide the mapping between SIP and H.323
   signaling messages. The following have been accomplished in this
   document:

     1.         We have explained the difference between the first and third
        party call control.

     2.         We have described how the third party call management can be
        done by the third party call controller with the help of SIP
        REGISTRAR and Location server.

     3.         We have proposed a third party call control service for H.323
        along with the third party call management using H.323
        discovery and registration messages.

Internet Draft            3pcc Interworking           February 22, 2002



     4.         We have shown how the third party call control entity can offer
        transparent services interworking between SIP- and H.323-based
        IP Telephony network whether the controller is placed within
        the SIP- or H.323-side of the network. The fast call setup of
        the H.323 side has also been addressed to reveal the fact it
        helps to reduce the call setup time drastically. H.323 fast
        call setup time helps  the SIP side not to cause spurious
        retransmissions or timeouts. The H.323 tunneling mechanisms
        will also help to reduce the call setup time, but as much as it
        is done in the case of the fast call setup time.

     5.         We have analyzed that the third party call control function is
        a generic one and can be implemented over a application
        separate server, over a SIP proxy, over a SIP endpoint, over an
        H.323 GK, over an H.323 endpoint, or on a SIP-H.323 IWF based
        on the cost, performance, and policy decision.

     6.         We have described the mechanisms for address resolution and
        media control when the third party call controller establishes
        the call between the SIP and H.323 endpoints.

     7.         We have provided solution for discovery and registration
        related to the IWFs and SIP proxies/Location servers in the SIP
        side that may be needed to accomplish the transparent services
        by the third party call controller interworking between SIP-
        and H.323-side.

     8.         We have identified the issues related to the bandwidth
        reservation, accounting, authentication, authorization, policy
        in the context of the third party call control services.

     9.         We have described that the call flows (what have been shown in
        the case of the controller in the SIP side) will be similar if
        the controller is placed to the H.323 side.

     10.        Although we have shown the call flows for the two-party
        case where one endpoint in the SIP side while the other party
        in the H.323 side, the multiparty call scenarios for SIP-H.323
        interworkig can also be done in a similar way as in the case of
        the two-party scenarios.

     11.        We have explained that the implementation of the third
        party call control function in a SIP proxy, SIP endpoint, H.323
        GK, H.323 endpoint, MCU, or SIP-H.323 IWF is a special case of
        the generalized mechanism that has been described in this
        contribution.
