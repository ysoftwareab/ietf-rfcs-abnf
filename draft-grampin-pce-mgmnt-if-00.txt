Abstract 
   
  The Path Computation Element (PCE) Architecture provide a framework 
  to support the Constraint-Based Routing (CBR) functionality for 
  traffic engineering systems in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) 
  and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks.  
  The model define the PCC and PCE entities at the Control Plane, which 
  communicate using a Request/Reply protocol. 
  The PCE architecture enable network operators a tight control of the 
  resource assignment by means of the administrative constraints that 
  are included in the Traffic Enginnering Database (TED), and used in 
  the path computation process. Moreover, appropriate objective 
  funtions assist operators in the fulfillment of the overall network 
  objectives. 
   
  This document present a system architecture for the PCE, namely 
  Routing and Management Agent (RMA), with  a standard management 
  interface, which permit established management frameworks to rely on

1.   Introduction 
   
  The Routing and Management Agent (RMA), interacts with both the 
  Control Plane and the Management Plane, assuming the PCE role in the 
  PCE Architecture [PCE-ARCH], as shown in Figure 1.  
   
  This entity, while enabling a Control Plane-based provisioning, can 
  be used as a traffic engineering tool by management applications, 
  using its interface towards the Management Plane. This interface can 
  be used to establish cooperative relationship with other RMAs in the 
  "multi-PCE path computation with PCE-intercommunication model" , as  
  specified in [PCE-ARCH]. 
   
  The RMA management interface is reachable in the management DCN, 
  therefore integrating the RMA into a distributed management 
  framework.

2.1      Signalling Interface 
   
  This component interfaces with PCCs via a suitable Request/Reply 
  protocol, as required by [PCE-COMM-REQ], and is out of the scope of 
  this document.  
   
2.2      IGP Interface 
   
  The RMA gathers network topology running an instance of the network 
  TE IGP (OSPF-TE [RFC3630] or ISIS-TE [RFC3784]), communicating 
  through this interface. The RMA is like any node in the routing 
  graph, usually without forwarding capabilities, even though the PCE 
  functionality is orthogonal to packet forwarding, as defined in [PCE-
  ARCH]. The goal of this component is to maintain the Topology 
  DataBase (TDB), which in turn is used to feed the Traffic Engineering 
  DataBase (TE-DB), the basic information source for CBR computation.  
   
2.3      CBR Computation Component 
   
  This is the core of the RMA, which provides the intended 
  functionality: a computation engine for Constraint-Based Routing. The 
  component implements the needed algorithms to solve the Path 
  Computation problem with multiple restrictions. Well-known algorithms 
  and heuristics can be used to accomplish the intended goal, making 
  sure that route computation time is limited (i.e. by the usage of 
  polynomial-time CBR algorithms).  
   
  The two tier architecture with a computation cluster is presented in 
  Section 3 is able to fulfill this objective.  
   
2.4      Traffic Engineering DataBase Component 
   
  The TE-DB contains the up-to-date information regarding link states 
  in the network, gathered by the IGP Interface. Additional 
  information, like constraints and administrative policies can also be 
  made persistent in the TE-DB. This information, which defines the TE  
  objectives of the network, will typically come from Policy-Based 
  Management applications. 
 
2.5      Management Plane Interface 
   
  This component implements the interaction with management 
  applications, which enables the RMA to be used as a traffic 
  engineering component for high-level applications. Other 
  possibilities of this interface include the usage of the RMA as a 
  network-wide monitoring agent.

  This interface may be based in well-known distributed component 
  frameworks like CORBA, widely used by telecommunication operators, 
  and/or J2EE, .NET or other usual packages in use in the enterprise 
  and Internet environments. 
   
  The information model used in this interfaces, as well as object 
  access granularity issues (coarse or fine grain) are out of the scope 
  of this document, and may be further standardized.  
 
   
3.   Two Tier RMA Architecture 
   
  The RMA is designed as a component-based system, as detailed in the 
  previous section. As described in other documents of the PCE WG, 
  several issues arise regarding the design and implementation of a PCE 
  Architecture; in particular availability and fault tolerance are of 
  major impact in network operation. This section review some of these 
  problems and propose some implementation guidelines. 
   
3.1    RMA availability and fault-tolerance 
   
  A PCE centralized solution may suffer potential bottleneck problems 
  and is a single point of failure is not careful designed. 
   
  A Two Tier Architecture comprises a reliable communication front-end 
  with a computation back-end cluster, where the well-known High 
  Performance Computing paradigm may be of use. This architecture is 
  shown in Figure 3. This is a proven architecture used by Service and 
  Content Providers for high-availability services such as web-server 
  farms, VoD headends, E-Mail distributed servers. In the figure there 
  are two front-end sets, one to handle Control Plane communication, 
  and the other for the Management Plane. This separation, while not 
  mandatory, is advisable given that very different kind of protocols 
  need to be supported. 
   
  High availavility is given by two factors:  
   
  a) arbitrary large set of front-end (i.e. signaling) processors and,  
  b) arbitrary large set of computation nodes in the back-end cluster. 
   
  The remaining point of failure is network connectivity (both internal 
  and external). Internal connectivity (i.e. between front and back-
  ends) can be protected by redundant LAN switches, while different 
  options exist to overcome potential external connectivity failure. A 
  straightforward (and expensive) solution is to place disjoint RMA 
  clusters in the network, while an acceptable solution would be to 
  have a multi-homed approach, i.e. use multiple load-sharing links. 
  Other useful techniques include VRRP [RFC3768] and DNS Round-Robin, 
  among others.

3.2    Traffic Engineering Database (TE-DB) 
   
  The construction of the TE-DB involves two asynchronous process: 
   
  a) update of Topology Database (TDB) by the IGP 
  b) policy and administrative information insertion from management 
  applications. 
   
  The topology database (TDB) suffer intrinsic innacuracies, due to the 
  update mechanisms of the IGPs and the hierarchical routing approach 
  with information summarization. Some form of inaccuracy reduction 
  shall be implemented to reduced the gap between the gathered TDB and 
  the actual network state. This, consequently, will reduce the 
  blocking probability and the need for cranckback procedures in 
  provisioning time.  
   
  Policy and administrative information is inserted in the TE-DB by 
  management processes. Policy-Based Network Management enable network 
  administrators to manage network behaviour using high-level 
  definitions, or policies, which shall be expressed unambiguously. 
  These policies, associated with an abstract model of the managed 
  objects and accurate network status information permit to trigger or 
  refrain certain actions on network elements, resulting in an 
  enforcement of the high level policies. The policy language and 
  information model is out of the scope of this proposal.

                      PCE Management Interface             July 2005 
 
 
  Typical administrative information comprises link resource class 
  (colour), SRLGs, etc, while a simple routing policy is to deny the 
  establishment of LSPs with bandwith grater than a certain value, to 
  tune the load sharing of traffic demands and minimize blocking 
  probability. 
   
3.3    The CBR process 
   
  There are a number of heuristics and a few exact algorithms to solve 
  the CBR process in near real time. The implementation shall evaluate 
  the applicable approaches to the RMA, taking into account the 
  objective functions, the system of demands, network and 
  administrative constraints that need to be satisfied.  
 
4.   Autodiscovery of RMAs 
   
  Autodiscovery requirements are defined in [PCE-DISC-REQ]. The RMA 
  architecture could implement a very basic static strategy, relying on 
  LSRs' local configuration; since the RMA architecture is redundant 
  and fault-tolerant, this may be considered a minor drawback. 
   
   
5.   Security Considerations 
   
  A potential security issue is raised by the fact that the proposed 
  architecture has connections to the network elements via the Control 
  Plane interface, and to the management applications via the 
  Management Plane interface. Specially crafted packets in the Control 
  Plane could eventually be used to gain access to the RMA with 
  potential incidence in network management applications. This is for 
  further study.
