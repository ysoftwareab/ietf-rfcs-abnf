          2. Abstract

          This document defines an experimental portion of the Management
          Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols
          in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular, it defines objects for
          managing the operation of the Integrated IS-IS routing protocol
          (defined in RFC 1195 [1]).


          3. Introduction

          The Integrated IS-IS routing protocol is an extension of the ISO
          Intra-Domain Routeing Protocol defined in ISO 10589 [2]. The
          extension provides the ability for the protocol to include IP
          reachability information together with OSI reachability
          information.

          This document defines an experimental portion of the MIB
          containing objects for managing the operation of the Integrated
          IS-IS protocol. The objects are mainly derived from the GDMO



          Gunner   (Internet-Draft expires end September 1993)    [Page 3]

          Internet-Draft        Integrated IS-IS MIB            March 1993



          definitions in ISO 10589 and from the GDMO definitions in ISO
          10733 [5]. There are also additional objects to manage the
          IP-specific functionality of Integrated IS-IS operation.


          4. Overview of Objects

          The object definitions are fully contained in Section 5.

          Objects are split into a number of groups. Some of these groups
          are optional either because implementations may choose to omit
          certain pieces of optional functionality or because the
          implementation in a system does not enable some piece of
          functionality. For example, a router which does not implement
          the authentication procedures need not implement the
          authentication group.

          In order to keep the number of groups and tables defined in this
          MIB reasonably small, some tables contain objects which will not
          always be relevant in each entry in the table. For example, the
          system table (isisSysTable) contains objects for both level 1
          and level 2 operation of the protocol, but each specific
          instance of the protocol is only level 1 or level 2. The objects
          which are irrelevant must still exist in the table entry
          (following the standard MIB conformance requirement) but their
          values are undefined.

          The defined groups are:

          - System
          - System Integrated
          - Level 2 IP
          - Authentication
          - Partition Repair
          - Circuit
          - Circuit IS
          - Circuit Authentication
          - IS Adjacency
          - IS Adjacency IP
          - IS Adjacency Integrated
          - ES Adjacency
          - Reachable Address
          - IP Reachable Address
          - Level 1 CLNP Destination
          - Level 2 CLNP Destination
          - IP Destination

          The object definitions in general follow the dynamic model of
          creation that is a property of the managed objects defined in
          ISO 10589. This means, for example, that most tables allow



          Gunner   (Internet-Draft expires end September 1993)    [Page 4]

          Internet-Draft        Integrated IS-IS MIB            March 1993



          dynamic creation and deletion of entries (rows) and that many
          other objects have read-write access. However, these operations
          are often restricted according to various states of the system
          as described by the BEHAVIOUR clauses in the ISO 10589 GDMO
          descriptions of the managed objects from which they are derived.
          For example, some objects may only be written when Integrated
          IS-IS operation is disabled. These restrictions are explained in
          line with the object definitions in section 5 together with
          references to general behaviour definitions defined in section 5.

          The MIB provides for multiple instances of the Integrated IS-IS
          protocol to exist on the same system. This is accomplished by
          providing multiple table entries in the system table and, in
          general, by adding an instance index object to other tables.


          4.1. Row creation

          Row creation in the tables defined in this MIB may be
          accomplished according to the mechanisms outlined in [3]. An
          agent is permitted to follow any of the mechanims defined in
          [3]. If the agent permits row creation then the following
          description shows one method by which this can be done (note:
          this is only an example, the agent is free to choose any other
          method compatible with [3]).

          Row creation may be actioned when an SNMP Set PDU is received
          which sets the value of the xxxExistState object in a
          non-existant row in a table to the value on. The agent may then
          create a new row for the table setting the values of any other
          following objects in the Set PDU and those index objects whose
          values are implicitly set by the OID for the xxxExistState
          object. The xxxOperState object for the row should be set to off
          if not explicitly set; and all objects not explicitly set but
          which have a default value defined may have their values set to
          the default. At this stage, there may be objects in the row
          which still have no defined value because they do not have a
          default value defined and because they were not explicitly set
          by the Set PDU. Before the xxxOperState object can be set to on,
          such objects should have their values set by further Set PDUs.

          If the agent permits rows to be incompletely created (i.e. not
          all objects which have no defined default value are set in the
          same Set PDU that sets the xxxExistState object) then the agent
          may impose a time limit on the creation of a row so that an
          incompletely created row may be garbage-collected should the
          initiating management station fail to complete the row creation.

          Alternatively the agent may simply not permit incomplete row
          creation, requiring instead that all objects which have no

          Internet-Draft        Integrated IS-IS MIB            March 1993



          defined default value are present in the single Set PDU that
          creates the row.


          4.2. Row Deletion

          Row deletion is accomplished by setting the value of a single
          object, generally named "xxxExistState" in the row defined to
          have that semantic. Agents may optionally remove the complete
          row from the MIB or leave it present. The semantics of a row
          which is left present but which has been "deleted" are that it
          appears in Get Response PDUs but that it is treated as
          non-existant for all other purposes including row creation.


          4.3. Events and Traps

          No attempt has been made in this MIB to define SNMP traps
          equivalent to the Notifications defined in ISO 10589.


          4.4. Format of Definitions

          The object definitions in Section 5 use the OBJECT-TYPE macro
          defined in [3] These definitions are self-describing.

          The definitions make use of the new type OSINSAddress in some
          INDEX clauses of the OBJECT-TYPE macro. In forming the
          instance-identifier associated with such an INDEX clause usage,
          the OSINSAddress is treated as a variable length OCTET STRING so
          that it forms n+1 sub-identifiers, where n is the length of the
          OCTET STRING (the first sub-identifier is n itself, following
          this, each octet of the OCTET STRING is encoded in a separate
          sub-identifier).

                    explicit: The subnetwork address in the object
                    isisRASNPAAddress is to be used.

          6. Security Considerations

          Security issues are not discussed in this memo but readers
          should note that this MIB does contain support for the
          authentication mechanisms defined in [2]. As currently defined
          these do not provide any real security.
