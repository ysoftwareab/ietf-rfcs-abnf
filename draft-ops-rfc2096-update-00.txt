                                Abstract

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
particular, it describes managed objects used for implementations of the
Internet Protocol (IP) in an IP version independent manner.

1.  The SNMP Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [2].

o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
  purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
  Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16,
  RFC 1155 [3], STD 16, RFC 1212 [4] and RFC 1215 [5]. The second
  version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [6], STD 58,
  RFC 2579 [7] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [8].

o Message protocols for transferring management information.  The first
  version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in
  STD 15, RFC 1157 [9]. A second version of the SNMP message protocol,
  which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c
  and described in RFC 1901 [10] and RFC 1906 [11]. The third version of
  the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [11],
  RFC 2572 [12] and RFC 2574 [13].

o Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The first
  set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
  STD 15, RFC 1157 [9]. A second set of protocol operations and
  associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [14].

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: August 2001             February 2001


o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [15] and the
  view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [16].

A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
can be found in RFC 2570 [17].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB
conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.

2.  Revision History

Changes from first draft posted to v6mib mailing list:

23 Feb 2001

     Update MODULE-IDENTITY

     Delete inetCidrRouteTos, add inetCidrRouteInstance in INDEX of
     inetCidrRouteTable.

     Use InterfaceIndex, InetAddressPrefixLength and
     InetAutonomousSystemNumber TC's, and limit the SIZE of
     inetCidrRouteDest and inetCidrRouteNextHop

     Update conformance info.

     Added copyright and table of contents.


3.  Overview

The MIB consists of three tables and one? global object.

(1) The object ipForwardNumber indicates the number of current routes.
    This is primarily to avoid having to read the table in order to
    determine this number.




Fenner                                              Section 3.  [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: August 2001             February 2001


(2) The ipForwardTable updates the RFC 1213 ipRouteTable to display
    multipath IP Routes.  This is in turn obsoleted by the
    ipCidrRouteTable.

(3) The ipCidrRouteTable updates the RFC 1213 ipRouteTable to display
    multipath IP Routes having the same network number but differing
    network masks.

(4) The inetCidrRouteTable updates the RFC 2096 ipCidrRouteTable to
    contain IP version independent routing information.

5.  Open Issues / To Do

Trash this completely and start from scratch with a new MIB?

Routing table instance identifier?

Any other objects from RFC 2465's ipv6RouteTable?

Figure out what the inetCidrRouteTos object really should be -- DSCP?
Arbitrary mapped with no specified default?

Better wording for ipForwardCompliance2?

Note: more open issues / to do items scattered in comments in MIB.

6.  Acknoledgments

8.  Security Considerations


There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a
MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may be
considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The



Fenner                                             Section 8.  [Page 27]

INTERNET-DRAFT            Expires: August 2001             February 2001


support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
sensitive information. These are:

The routing table can be used to discover information about the network
topology within a domain.

It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
for such a secure environment.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model RFC 2574 [13] and the View-based Access Control
Model RFC 2575 [16] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give
access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
