Abstract

   This specification defines a file format for annotating and indexing
   time-continuous bitstreams for the World Wide Web.  The format has
   been named ANNODEX(TM) for annotating and indexing.  The ANNODEX(TM)
   format enables the specification of named anchor points in
   time-continuous bitstreams together with textual annotations and
   hyperlinks in URI [4] format.  These anchor points are merged
   time-synchronously with the time-continuous bitstreams on authoring a
   file in ANNODEX(TM) format.  The ultimate aim of the ANNODEX(TM)
   format is to enable an integration of time-continous bitstreams into

   the browsing and searching functionality of the World Wide Web.

   At this point in time, the right to produce derivative works is not
   granted to the IETF as the authors are uncertain about the necessity
   to create a working group.  The specification is not encumbered by
   patents.  The ANNODEX(TM) format is protected by a trademark to
   prevent the use of the term "annodex" for any related but
   non-conformant and therefore non-interoperable technology.

1. Introduction

   When searching the World Wide Web, continuous media files such as
   audio and video files are still treated as "dark matter".  It is not
   possible to look inside such files, search for their content through
   common text-based search engines, and actually directly access points
   of interest inside them.  The file can only be consumed in its
   entirety until the point of interest is reached.  In addition, such
   files are "dead ends" in that by consuming their content the
   hyperlinking functionality of the Web is left behind.

   This document specifies a file format for interleaving of XML markup
   with time-continuous data giving ANNODEX(TM) format media.  The
   ANNODEX(TM) format together with the Continuous Media Markup Language
   (CMML) [14] and the URI standard [4], extended by temporal URI
   references [13] build the basis technology to enable searching and
   surfing of time-continuous data via existing Web infrastructure.  The
   ANNODEX(TM) format enables encapsulation of any type of streamable
   time-continuous bitstream format thus being independent of current or
   future compression formats.  The XML tags were chosen to be very
   similar to XHTML to enable a simple transfer of knowledge for HTML
   authors.

   The file extension of ANNODEX(TM) files is ".anx".  This document
   also applies for registration of the mime-type "application/annodex"
   for ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams.

   The structure of this document is as follows: the introduction
   describes the architecture of a Continuous Media Web based on
   ANNODEX(TM) format media files and give an overview of the
   ANNODEX(TM) media file format.  The XML tags required to create
   ANNODEX(TM) format media consist of two types of frames: header and
   anchor frames.  They form the annotation bitstream and are described
   in section 4.  The section on media encapsulation then describes the
   mutiplexing format.  The handling of the different time constructs in
   ANNODEX(TM) format media is quite complex and gets discussed in
   detail in section 6.  The MIME type application and security
   considerations build the final sections.  Last but not least the
   appendices give the actual specifications of the "head" and "a" DTDs
   and definitions and acronyms.

   Please note that this document assumes that the reader has a fluent
   working knowledge of XML [1], HTML [2], XHTML [3] and the World Wide
   Web.  Deep knowledge of the Ogg encapsulation format version 0 [10]
   is also a prerequisite to understanding of this specification.  It is
   also a sister document to the specification of the Continous Media
   Markup Language (CMML Version 1.0) [14] for authoring ANNODEX(TM)
   format bitstreams.

2. The architecture of a Continuous Media Web

   As with Webpages, ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams first have to be
   authored and then published on a Server.  Authoring includes the
   creation of the media bitstream plus the creation of annotations
   (i.e.  textual data descriptions), indexes (i.e.  anchor points) and
   hyperlinks (i.e.  URIs [4]) for fragments of the media data.
   Annotations, indexes and hyperlinks are encoded in XML [1] according
   to the DTDs given in the appendix and interleaved into the media
   document to create ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams in a
   time-synchronous fashion.  This procedure can be performed both on
   files and live streams.  The collection of ANNODEX(TM) format
   bitstreams on the Internet is called the Continuous Media Web as it
   builds a Web of time-continuous resources.

   Distribution of ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams happens via a network
   protocol such as HTTP [5] or RTP/RTSP [6].  The basic process is the
   following: The client dispatches a download or streaming request to
   the server with a certain URI.  The server resolves the URI and
   starts packetising ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams, taking into account
   temporal URI fragment specifications.

   In case of packet loss due to an unreliable transport, media data or
   anchor data may get lost; this may be important to the application or
   not.  Both media and mark-up data are treated with the same
   importance.  If a user doesn't care whether the media data is
   completely received, then the mark-ups will be regarded the same way.
   Anchors are typically treated as state changes; if an anchor tag gets
   lost, the next anchor tag will restore the proper state.  We
   envisage, however, that a client may require the current state
   information, so there should be a protocol request for sending the
   current state again.  This will be delivered by the server by
   inserting another copy of the currently active anchor into the
   ANNODEX(TM) bitstream.

   To access the Continuous Media Web, a client such as a conformant Web
   browser is required.  A client can link to an ANNODEX(TM) bitstream
   via a URI.  A URI can point to a temporal offset in the ANNODEX(TM)
   bitstream using temporal URI fragment identifiers [13] or to a named
   offset by using the id tag of an anchor frame as a URI fragment
   identifier.  In this way, direct access to points of interest in the
   media document is enabled.  While playing back ANNODEX(TM) format
   bitstreams, a user is being offered hyperlinks (URIs) to other Web
   resources which (in the author's eye) are related to the currently
   displayed media content.

   A client may be a special player or a browser plugin.  This
   application must split an ANNODEX(TM) format bitstream into its

   constituent header and anchor frames, and the media document.  A
   decoder is required to display the encapsulated media document after
   decoding it with the appropriate media decoder.  While playing back
   the media document, the application displays the hyperlinks and the
   annotations for the active anchor frames.

   Search engines can include published ANNODEX(TM) format files into
   their search repertoire by finding annotations in the anchor frames
   in a standard way independent of the encoding and packetising format
   of the media document.  This allows any media format to be spidered.
   In addition, the protocol should allow to download only the CMML
   mark-up from a published ANNODEX(TM) format file.  This will stop
   spiders from creating extensive network loads as they do not need to
   download the media bitstream to gain the necessary information.  It
   also reduces the size of search archives, even for large amounts of
   published ANNODEX(TM) format files, because a CMML file contains all
   searchable annotations for the media fragments of its ANNODEX(TM)
   format file.

3. Overview of the ANNODEX(TM) bitstream format

   The format of ANNODEX(TM) bitstreams consists of a bitstream of
   time-continuous data interspersed with structured XML mark-up of an
   annotation bitstream.  It is designed to be used both as a persistent
   file format and as a streaming format.  Any encoding format for
   time-continuous data can be encapsulated in the ANNODEX(TM) format as
   long as it is streamable and is based on a regular data sampling rate
   (called granulerate).  XML mark-up is inserted between media packets
   at the synchronised point in time.

   There are two types of XML mark-up that are inserted: a header frame
   ("head"), and an arbitrary number of anchor frames ("a").  There is
   only one head at the start of an annotation bitstream.  It contains
   structured and unstructured meta data describing the complete
   time-continuous data bistream.  In the simple case, an anchor frame
   contains information on the fragment of media between the current
   anchor and the next one (or the end of the document if none follows).

   The following figure gives an example of such an ANNODEX(TM) format
   bitstream and the temporal regions during which the "head" and "a"
   frames are valid.  It describes the simple case where anchor frames
   don't overlap in time and there is only one media bitstream.

     |head|   |a|           |a|             |a|                  |a|        |
     |    |   | |           | |             | |                  | |        |

     |----------------------------------------------------------------------|


   There is also a more complex scheme of authoring anchors for
   ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams.  In it, anchors are grouped together
   by giving them a type.  Anchors of one type are not allowed to
   overlap in time, but anchors of different type may overlap.  This
   enables the creation of different tracks of annotation.  The
   advantage is that it gives the author the choice to describe a
   specific media file from different aspects, e.g.  by giving different
   language tracks.  The client application then has the choice to
   display only the default track or offer all existing tracks to the
   user.

4. The annotation bitstream

   The annotation bitstream consists of a "head" frame and and arbitrary
   number of "a" frames.  These tags are briefly explained in this
   section.

4.1 The 'head' frame

   A "head" frame is an XML document that contains information about the
   complete ANNODEX(TM) format bitstream.  It is enclosed in "head"
   tags.  The DTD for the "head" frame can be found at http://
   www.annodex.net/DTD/anxhead_1_0.dtd .  It can be used for validation
   of a "head" frame.

   An example for a "head" frame is the following:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE head SYSTEM "anxhead_1_0.dtd">
   <head lang="en" defltlang="de">
     <title lang="en">The Matrix</title>
     <base href="http://www.foo.bar/"/>
     <meta name="Movie"     content="The Matrix"/>
     <meta name="Producer"  content="Joel Silver"/>
     <meta name="Director"  content="Larry Wachowski"/>
     <meta name="Director"  content="Andy Wachowski"/>
     <meta name="Writer"    content="The Wachowski Brothers"/>
   </head>

   The xml declaration and the reference to the DTD make the "head"
   frame a proper xml document.  The DTD of the "head" frame is given in
   the appendix and technically fully specifies the "head" frame.  The
   semantic meaning of each of the tags and attributes is the same as in
   the CMML [14].  Please refer to the CMML specification document for
   details.

4.2 The 'a' frame

   An anchor frame is an XML document that contains information about a
   fragment of the encapsulated time-continuous bitstream.  It is active
   from the time instant in the time-continuous bitstream at which it is
   inserted until the time instant at which it is deactivated either
   through another anchor frame (on the same annotation track) or
   through the end of the file.  It is enclosed in "a" tags.  The DTD
   for the "a" frame can be found at http://www.annodex.net/DTD/
   anxa_1_0.dtd .  It can be used for validation of an "a" frame.

   An example for an "a" frame is the following:

     instead only try to realize the truth." Neo: "What truth?" Spoon
     boy: "There is no spoon." Neo: "There is no spoon?" Spoon boy: "Then
     you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only
     yourself." Neo tries again...

     L&ouml;ffel durch Telekinese zu verbiegen, bekommt er von dem Kind den
     Rat: "Den L&ouml;ffel gibt es nicht."
     </desc>
   </a>

   Unlike the "head" frame, the anchor frame contained within an
   ANNODEX(TM) format media file does not contain an xml declaration and
   a reference to the DTD.  This information can be extrapolated from
   the information stored in the "head" frame and would create an
   unnecessary overhead if included in every anchor frame.  It is
   however necessary when extracting the anchor frame into a proper XML
   document.  The used version of xml can be extracted from the related
   head frame, the dtd reference is the same as the one for the head
   frame with replacing every occurance of "head" by "a".  For example:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE a SYSTEM "anxa_1_0.dtd">

   Although the "a" element can be considered as the root element of an
   anchor frame described as an XML document, it also does not contain a
   xmlns attribute.  The reason is that the same namespace as in the
   associated "head" frame is valid for all "a" frames in an ANNODEX(TM)
   format bitstream and a repetition would only spend bandwidth
   unnecessarily and be a cause for error.  Similarly the default
   language and directionality specified in the "head" frame are also
   valid for the anchor frames.

   The DTD of the anchor frame is given in the appendix and technically
   fully specifies the frame format.  The semantic meaning of each of
   the tags and attributes is the same as in the CMML [14].  Please

5. Media encapsulation format

   An ANNODEX(TM) format bitstream consists of XML markup in the
   annotation bitstream interleaved with the related media frames of the
   media bitstreams into a single bitstream.

   It is not possible to use straight XML as encapsulation because XML
   cannot enclose binary data except encoded as Unicode.  The use of
   Unicode would introduce too much overhead.  Therefore, an
   encapsulation format that could handle binary bitstreams and textual
   frames was required.

   The following list gives a summary of the requirements for the
   ANNODEX(TM) format bitstream:

   o  framing for binary time-continuous data and XML.

   o  temporal synchronisation between time-continuous media bitstreams
      and XML on interleaving.

   o  temporal resynchronisation after parsing error.

   o  detection of corruption.

   o  seeking landmarks for direct random access.

   o  streaming capability (i.e.  the information required to parse and
      decode a bitstream part is available at the time at which the
      bitstream part is reached and does not come e.g.  at the end of
      the stream).

   o  small overhead.

   o  simple interleaving format with a track paradigm.

   The Ogg encapsulation format version 0 [10] was chosen as the
   encapsulation format for ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams as it provides
   for all the requirements and has proven reliable and stable.

5.1 Media mapping for Ogg encapsulation

   This section specifies the way the Ogg media encapsulation framework
   is used for creating ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams.  As such,
   knowledge of the Ogg bitstream format as specified in the Ogg RFC
   [10] is presumed.  Please also refer to that document for
   descriptions of the terms used in this document.  This section
   describes the specific media mapping that is used for ANNODEX(TM)
   format bitstreams.

Internet-Draft                  ANNODEX                        June 2003


   ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams consist of one or more time-continuous
   media bitstreams and an XML annotation bitstream concurrently
   interleaved (in Ogg terms: multiplexed) into an Ogg bitstream.
   Sequential multiplexing is allowed, but can only happen with complete
   ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams.

   Every ANNODEX(TM) format bitstream consists of at least two logical
   bitstreams: the ANNODEX(TM) media mapping bitstream and the
   annotation bitstream that contains the "head" and the "a" tags.  The
   bos pages of these two (in order) are followed by the bos pages of
   any number of media bitstreams.  Then all the secondary header pages
   of all the media bitstreams follow, including a packet of the
   annotation bitstream containing the "head" tag as secondary header
   for the annotation bitstream.  Then, the bitstream data is
   multiplexed in time-synchronous fashion.

5.2 The format of the ANNODEX(TM) media mapping bos

   The ANNODEX(TM) media mapping bitstream consists only of one bos page
   which contains information for the complete physical bitstream.  The
   bos page has the following format:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   The LSb (least significant bit) comes first in the Bytes.  Fields
   with more than one byte length are encoded LSB (least significant
   byte) first.

   The fields in the ANNODEX(TM) bos page have the following meaning:

   1.  Identifier: a 8 Byte field that identifies this file to be of
       ANNODEX(TM) format.  It contains the magic numbers:

          0x41 'A'

          0x6e 'n'

          0x6e 'n'

          0x6f 'o'

          0x64 'd'

          0x65 'e'

          0x78 'x'

          0x00 '\0'

   2.  Version major: 2 Byte short integer number signifying the major
       version number of the ANNODEX(TM) format bitstream.  This
       document specifies the major version 1.

   3.  Version minor: 2 Byte short integer number signifying the minor
       version number of the ANNODEX(TM) format bitstream.  This
       document specifies the minor version 0.

   4.  Timebase numerator & denominator: 8 Byte integer number each.
       They represent together the timebase of the ANNODEX(TM) format
       bitstream given as a rational number.  The denominator represents
       the temporal resolution at which the timebase is given.  E.g.  5
       on 1000 results in a timebase of 0.005 sec.  This enables a very
       high temporal resolution without having to store floating point
       numbers.

   5.  UTC: a 20 Byte string containing a UTC time in the form of
       YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.sssZ.  It associates a calendar date and a
       wall-clock time with the timebase.  It is a zero length string if
       not in use.

   Please note: The possible temporal resolution of the timebase is on
   the order of 2^-64.  However the time formats in use for media that
   are described in this document range from 1/24 to 1/60 for the
   different smpte formats and to 1/1000 for npt.  Thus, this resolution
   is enough for anyone of them.  What's more, this resolution is
   expected to accommodate any future needs of time resolution for any
   other time format (and time-continuous sampled data).

5.3 The format of the media and annotation bitstream media mapping bos

   The media and annotation bitstreams start each with one bos page
   containing information required for the decoding of the bitstream.
   After that, secondary header pages follow that contain information to
   set up the decoder for the bitstream and other stream-specific
   information.  Then, the pages that contain the actual data follow.
   For the annotation bitstream, the "head" frame is encapsulated into
   one (or more) secondary header pages.  The anchor frames represent
   the actual data of the annotation bitstream.

   The bos page of a media or annotation bitstream has the following
   format:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   The LSb (least significant bit) comes first in the Bytes.  Fields
   with more than one byte length are encoded LSB (least significant
   byte) first.

   The fields in the ANNODEX(TM) bos page have the following meaning:

   1.  Identifier: a 8 Byte field that identifies this file to be of a
       logical input bitstream with encoded information.  It contains
       the magic numbers:

          0x41 'A'

          0x6e 'n'

          0x78 'x'

          0x44 'D'

          0x61 'a'

          0x74 't'

          0x61 'a'

          0x00 '\0'

   2.  Granule rate numerator & denominater: 8 Byte integer number each.
       They represent the temporal resolution of the logical bitstream
       in Hz given as a rational number in the same way as the timebase
       attribute above.

   3.  Number of secondary header pages: a 4 Byte integer number that
       contains the number of secondary header pages of that particular
       logical bitstream following after this bos page.

   4.  Number of bytes used for mime type string: a 4 Byte integer
       number giving the length of the Mime type field following
       directly after this field and including the final NUL character.

   5.  Mime type string: a character sequence containing the mime [8]
       type of the data encoded in this logical bitstream.  E.g.  for
       the annotation bitstream it will be "text/cmml" as upon
       extraction of the annotation bitstream from the ANNODEX(TM)
       format bitstream a CMML document [14] results.

   6.  Number of bytes used for identifier string: a 4 Byte integer

6. Handling time in the ANNODEX(TM) format bitstream

   ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams inherently represent one timeline only,
   where the different media and the annotation bitstream can be thought
   of as content tracks on that timeline.  All of these tracks relate to
   the same timeline which starts at a certain time point and ends when
   the last bitstream ends.  An example bitstream can be seen in the
   following figure.  It consists of an ANNODEX(TM) format bitstream
   that contains 4 media bitstreams and the annotation bitstream.  In
   the flat representation these will be multiplexed such that the data
   frames of each of these bitstreams occurs at the correct time.

   The following bitstream is a conceptual representation of the time
   intervals covered by the different logical bitstreams:

   t0                                                                   tn

   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   | a1    | a2     | a3                   | a4                         |

   ---------------------------------------------
           --------------------------------------------------------------
           | video bitstream 1                                          |
           --------------------------------------------------------------
                    -----------------------------------------------------
                    | audio bitstream 2                                 |
                    -----------------------------------------------------
                           ------------------------------
                           | video bitstream 2          |
                           ------------------------------

   The time point at which the ANNODEX(TM) format bitstream starts (t0
   in the above example) is called the "timebase" and represents the
   playback time in seconds associated with the beginning of the
   ANNODEX(TM) format bitstream.  This start time may but does not have
   to be 0 - it can be any positive time offset.  This time offset is
   stored in the ANNODEX(TM) bitstream bos page.

   Each one of the encapsulated media bitstreams and the annotation
   bitstream have their own temporal resolution at which they can
   provide data to cover the given timeline.  This temporal resolution
   is usually given through the sampling rate of the particular
   bitstream.  For example, a raw audio bitstream at CD quality is
   sampled with a sampling rate of 44100 Hz.  A video bitstream may be



Pfeiffer & Parker       Expires December 7, 2003               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                  ANNODEX                        June 2003


   sampled with a frame rate of 25 frames per second.  This temporal
   resolution is stored in the "granulerate" field of the bos page of
   the bitstream.

   The "granulerate" is used for the calculation of the time position
   for which a data packet of the media bitstreams contains data.  The
   "granulepos" field in an Ogg page when divided by the "granulerate"
   of that page's logical bitstream provides the time position that is
   reached in that bitstream after decoding all data packets finished on
   this page.  E.g.  if an audio bitstream has a granulerate of 44100
   and starts at 0, then a granulepos of 88200 signifies that the
   bitstream has reached the second sec after the end of decoding this
   page's packets.

   The annotation bitstream's "granulerate" can be chosen arbitrarily by
   the bitstream multiplexer.  One option is to choose the least common
   multiple of the granulerates of all the media bitstreams to gain at
   least the resolution of the bitstreams.  However, that resultion may
   not be enough compared to the one that the author of anchors is
   asking for on insertion time.  One solution is to accommodate for all
   possible time schemes of the anchors.  Thus, a time resolution of the
   least common multiple of the resolution of all the npt and smpte time
   schemes is another option.

   The possible time schemes with their respecitve resolutions are:

   o  npt: 1000

   o  smpte-24: 24

   o  smpte-24-drop: 24/1.001 = 23.976 (approx.  as per SMPTE)

   o  smpte-25: 25

   o  smpte-30: 30

   o  smpte-30-drop: 30/1.001 = 29.970 (approx.  as per SMPTE)

   o  smpte-50: 50

   o  smpte-60: 60

   o  smpte-60-drop: 60/1.001 = 59.940 (approx.  as per SMPTE)

   To get to integer values, it is necessary to multiply all resolutions
   by 1000 and then take the least common multiple: lcm(1000000, 24000,
   23976, 25000, 30000, 29970, 50000, 60000, 59940) = 2997000000.  The
   "granulerate" would therefore be 2997000.  This provides for a

   temporal resolution on the order of 10^-6, accommodating for a mixed
   use of all the above given time schemes.

   The "granulepos" of the (set of) page(s) holding an anchor frame of
   the annotation stream has to signify the start time of that anchor
   frame.  E.g.  if the "granulerate" of the annotation bitstream is
   1000, the "timebase" is 0, and an anchor is to be inserted at
   npt=12.020, its "granulepos" will be 12020.  Anchors can be repeated
   in the ANNODEX(TM) format bitstream, which will be signified by
   having the same "track" attribute and the same page_sequence_number
   as the previous anchor frame.

7. MIME media type registration for 'application/annodex'

   This section contains the registration information for the
   'application/annodex' media type.  While this media type is not
   approved by the IANA, 'application/x-annodex' may be used.

   To: ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject: Registration of MIME media type application/annodex

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: annodex

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding Considerations: the ANNODEX(TM) enables encapsulation of any
   type of encoding format.  The authoring software has to provide for
   the encoders, while the client software has to look out for the
   browsers.

   Security considerations: see next section.

   Interoperability considerations: the ANNODEX(TM) bitstream format is
   a free specification that is independent of any media encoding
   format.  It is designed to provide interoperability with the existing
   World Wide Web.  Its specification is not patented and can be
   implemented by third parties without patent considerations.

   Additional information:

      Magic numbers: "OggS" identifies an Ogg page, "Annodex" identifies
      an Ogg page with an ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams, and "AnxData"
      signifies an Ogg page with media or annotation bitstream

      File extension: .anx

      Macintosh File Type Code: "ANDX"

      Intended usage: COMMON

   Fragment identifiers: Any named element, i.e.  element that contains
   an "id" attribute, may be referenced through a fragment identifier of
   a URI.  However, the values of the id attribute of the anchor tags
   are the most important ones used for addressing the identified "a"
   tags in the ANNODEX(TM) format bitstream.  Also, the generic temporal

   URI fragment addressing scheme [13] can be used as a fragment
   identifier on ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams and then relates to that
   specific time offset in the ANNODEX(TM) format bitstream, calculated
   with respect to the "timebase" of the ANNODEX(TM) bos page.

   An example for a URI to a named media fragment is the following:

   	      http://www.foo.bar/matrix.anx#no_spoon

   Examples for URIs to temporal fragments are the following:

   	      http://www.foo.bar/matrix.anx#@npt=21.4
   	      http://www.foo.bar/matrix.anx#@smpte-25=01:00:21:10

8. Security considerations

   ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams contain several multiplexed binary
   media and one XML annotation bitstream.  There is no generic
   encryption or signing mechanism provided for the complete bitstream
   or anyone of its parts.  As the format of the encapsulated media
   bitstreams is not prescribed and is identified through the "mimetype"
   field in that bitstream's bos page, it is possible to encrypt or sign
   that media bitstream and then mark it accordingly with a mime type
   that signifies the encryption.  It is up to the applications that use
   this bitstream to provide an appropriate codec to handle such
   bitstreams.

   As ANNODEX(TM) format bitstreams contain binary media bitstreams, it
   is possible to include executable content in them.  This can be an
   issue with applications that decode these bitstreams, especially when
   they are used in a network scenario.  Such applications have to
   ensure correct handling of manipulated bitstreams, of buffer overflow
   and the like.

Appendix C. Definitions of terms and abbreviations

   Anchor frame: XML data containing information on a fragment of a
      time-continuous bitstream.

   Fragment: a subpart of a media document covering some temporal
      interval.

   Mark-up: XML tags and their content used to describe a media
      document.

   ANNODEX(TM) media: encapsulated time-continuous bitstream with Head
      and Anchor frames.

   Annotating: the task of giving textual descriptions to fragments of
      media documents.

   Indexing: the task of identifying index points for media documents or
      fragments thereof.

   Hyperlinking: the task of linking from one Web resource to another.
      If a link has an offset into the resource, this is sometimes
      called deep hyperlinking.

   Head frame: XML data containing information on an ANNODEX(TM)ed media
      file.

   media packet: a block of digital data that represents a temporal
      subpart of a stream of continuous media.  Media packets of one
      continuous media file do not overlap in time.

   bitstream: a sequence of time-continuous data.
