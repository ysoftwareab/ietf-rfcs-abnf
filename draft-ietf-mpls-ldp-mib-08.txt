INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                   August 2001


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a MIB for the Label Distribution Protocol
   (LDP).  The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [18] is one of the MPLS
   protocols.  This MIB allows a user to configure LDP sessions as well
   as monitor all LDP sessions on the device.  This MIB also supports
   configuration for LDP using IP, ATM or FrameRelay media.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [21].


2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3.  Structure of the MIB

   This section describes the structure of the LDP MIB.


3.1.  Overview

   The MIB provides objects to configure/set-up potential LDP sessions
   on a specific LSR.  A table is used to configure potential LDP
   Sessions, where each row in the table initiates a potential LDP
   Session. This is the mplsLdpEntityTable.

   Another table, the mplsLdpPeerTable, is a read-only table which
   records information learned via discovery or from the session
   initialization message.  Each row in the Peer Table represents an LDP
   Peer.  This table contains information which is specific to the
   Entity-Peer interactions but is not appropriate for the
   mplsLdpSessionTable.  In other words, the Peer table contains
   information which is useful but is not strictly part of the Session.

   A third table is used to show the actual sessions which have been, or
   are in the process of being established.  Each row represents a
   specific session between an Entity (on this LSR) and a peer.


3.2.  Future Considerations

   The LDP Specification [18] does not specify the use of VPNs or
   multicast for LDP, and thus, objects related to these areas have not
   been included in the MIB.

   This MIB does not include VP merge configuration either.  [30] does
   not yet describe this capability and so it has been excluded from the
   MIB.

   These areas need to be specified in the LDP Specification prior to
   being added in this or any other MIB.


3.3.  Interface Indexing

   Interface Indexes as specified in [27] are used in the MIB.  The
   descriptions of the ifIndexes denote which ifIndex is being used.
   NOTE:  the use of ifIndex is for actual existing connections.


3.4.  Differences from the LDP Specification

   Currently, there are 3 differences between this specification and the
   LDP Specification.  As previously mentioned, this MIB is almost


Expires February 2002                                           [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                   August 2001


   entirely based on the LDP specification.  The differences are
   documented here in the hope to avoid any confusion between the two
   documents.

   The first difference is that the LDP Entity Table contains some
   DEFVAL clauses which are not specified explicitely in the LDP
   Specification.  These values, although not documented in the LDP
   Specification are widely used by existing LDP MIB implementations and
   thus, have been adopted within this MIB.  Please note, they can
   certainly be changed during row creation or a subsequent set request.

   A second difference is the mplsLdpEntityConfGenericLabelRangeTable.
   This table, although provided as a way to reserve a range of generic
   labels, does not exist in the LDP Specification.  It was added to the
   MIB due to a request from the working group and because this table
   was considered useful for reserving a range of generic labels.

   The third difference is documented by the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION,
   MplsAtmVcIdentifier which is in the MPLS-TC-MIB [36]. This TC was
   added to restrict vci values to be greater than 31 as described in
   RFC 3032 [30].


3.5.  Discussion of MIB Groups

   Currently, there are six groups: the MPLS LDP General Group, the MPLS
   LDP Generic Group, the MPLS LDP ATM Group, the MPLS LDP Frame Relay
   Group, the MPLS Mapping Group and the MPLS LDP Notifications Group.
   The MPLS LDP General Group and the MPLS LDP Notifications Group
   should always be supported.  The MPLS LDP Generic Group is specific
   to Generic labels and should be supported only if LDP is using
   Generic Labels.  The MPLS LDP ATM Group is specific to ATM and should
   be supported only if LDP is using ATM.  Likewise, the MPLS LDP Frame
   Relay group is specific to Frame Relay and should be supported only
   if LDP is using Frame Relay.  The MPLS LDP Mapping group should be
   supported if and only if the tables, mplsInSegmentTable,
   mplsOutSegmentTable and mplsXCTable from the LSR MIB are supported.


3.6.  The MPLS LDP General Group

   This group contains information about the specific LDP Entities which
   are associated with this agent. Each LSR must have at least one LDP
   Entity.


3.6.1.  The LDP Entity Table

   The LDP Entity Table provides a way to configure the LSR for using
   LDP.  There must be at least one LDP Entity for the LSR to support

   LDP.

   Each entry/row in this table represents a single LDP Entity.


3.6.2.  Changing Values After Session Establishment

   According to the LDP specification [18] there is no way to manually
   modify a session once session initialization starts.  One way to
   manually modify a session's parameters is by using SNMP to change the
   MIB objects related to that session.  Please note special care should
   be taken if MIB objects which are used in the MPLS LDP Session
   Initialization need to be modified.  If the modification of any of
   these MIB variables takes place anytime after the start of session
   intialization, then the entire session must be halted.  Any
   information learned by that session must be discarded. The objects
   should then be modified, and session initialization started.

   For example, assume that a user wishes to change the configuration of
   a Label Range which is used by a Session that has already been
   established.  The user should change the mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus to
   "disable(2)".  Setting the mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus to "disable(2)"
   will cause the session to be torn down and all LSPs established due
   to that session will also be torn down.  Also, all information
   related to that session should be removed from this MIB, and if the
   LSR MIB is implemented and the optional Mapping Table objects are
   implemented, then all information related to the LSPs in this session
   should be removed from these MIBs. [For more information please see
   the section on "The Mapping Tables".] At this point, the user could
   modify the Label Range.  Lastly, the user should set the
   mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus to "enable(1)".  At this point session
   initialization should occur.  The LDP Entity goes through the Session
   Initialization in order to communicate the new Label Ranges to the
   Peer and establish new LSPs.


3.6.3.  mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus and mplsLdpEntityRowStatus

   The mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus object could be viewed as having a
   subset of the functionality of the mplsLdpEntityRowStatus object.
   For example, the AdminStatus object has states of enable(1) and
   disable(2).  Setting the mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus object to
   disable(2) and setting the mplsLdpEntityRowStatus object to
   notInService(2) are functionally the same.  The motivation behind
   keeping the mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus object is that there could be
   situations where a user would be given write permission to the
   mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus object, but would not be given write
   permission to the mplsLdpEntityRowStatus object.   Having write
   permission to the mplsLdpEntityRowStatus object would mean that a
   user would be able to destroy a row.  This was the motivation for

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                   August 2001


   keeping the two objects.


3.6.4.  The LDP Entity Generic Objects

   The mplsLdpEntityConfGenericLabelRangeTable is for configuring LDP
   for using Generic Labels ranges.  Although the LDP Specification does
   not provide a way for configuring Label Ranges for Generic Labels,
   the MIB does provide a way to reserve a range of generic labels
   because this may be useful for LDP implementations which deploy
   generic labels.


3.6.5.  The LDP Entity ATM Objects

   There exists two tables to configure LDP for using ATM.  These tables
   are the mplsLdpEntityAtmParmsTable and the
   mplsLdpEntityConfAtmLabelRangeTable.

   The mplsLdpEntityAtmParmsTable provides a way to configure
   information which would be contained in the 'Optional Parameter'
   portion of an LDP PDU Initialization Message.

   The mplsLdpEntityConfAtmLabelRangeTable provides a way to configure
   information which would be contained in the 'ATM Label Range
   Components portion of an LDP PDU Intialization Message, see  [30] and
   [18].


3.6.6.  The LDP Entity Frame Relay Objects

   There exists two tables to configure LDP for using Frame Relay.
   These tables are the mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayParmsTable and the
   mplsLdpEntityConfFrLabelRangeTable.

   The mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayParmsTable provides a way to configure
   information which would be contained in the 'Optional Parameter'
   portion of an LDP PDU Initialization Message.

   The mplsLdpEntityConfFrLabelRangeTable provides a way to configure
   information which would be contained in the Frame Relay Label Range
   Components portion of an LDP PDU Intialization Message, see [32] and
   [18].


3.6.7.  The LDP Entity Statistics Table

   The mplsLpdEntityStatsTable is a read-only table which contains
   statistical information related to failed attempts to establish
   sessions. Each row in this table is related to a single LDP entity


Expires February 2002                                           [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                   August 2001


   and this table AUGMENTS an mplsLdpEntityEntry.  This table could be
   used to give insight into how to reconfigure values so that a session
   could be successfully established.  For example, if the
   mpslLdpSessionRejectedLabelRangeErrors Counter object was increasing,
   then this would indicate that the label range may need to be
   adjusted.


3.6.8.  The LDP Peer Table

   The LDP Peer Table is a read-only table which contains information
   about LDP Peers known to LDP Entities. A row in this table is related
   to one or more rows in the Hello Adjacency Table and related to a
   single row in the Session Table. The values in the Peer table are
   relevant to a Peer and may or may not be the same values used in the
   session.  For example, the Peer's PathLimit information is learned
   from the session initialization phase.  The actual value for the
   PathVectorLimit is the Peer's value and may not be part of the
   session.  There could be a mismatch in this value between the Entity
   and the Peer. In the event of a mismatch, then the session will use
   the PathLimit set by the Entity (and not the Peer).

   A separate table allows for a  more comprehensive and coherent MIB
   model.


3.6.9.  The LDP Hello Adjacencies Table

   This is a table of all adjacencies between all LDP Entities and all
   LDP Peers.  A Session may have one or more adjacencies.


3.6.10.  The LDP Session Table

   The LDP Session Table is a read-only table.  Each entry in this table
   represents a single session between an LDP Entity and a Peer. The
   mplsLdpPeerEntry AUGMENTS entries in this table.


3.6.11.  The LDP ATM Session Table

   The MPLS LDP ATM Session Table is a read-only table which contains
   session information specific to ATM.


3.6.12.  The LDP Frame Relay Session Table

   The MPLS LDP Frame Relay Session Table is a read-only table which
   contains session information specific to Frame Relay.

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                   August 2001


3.6.13.  The LDP Session Statistics Table

   The MPLS LDP Session Stats Table is a read-only table which contains
   statistical information on sessions.


3.6.14.  The LDP Session Peer Address Table

   The MPLS LDP Session Peer Address Table is a table which extends the
   mplsLdpSessionTable.  This table is a read-only table which stores
   Addresses learned after session initialization via Address Message
   advertisement.


3.6.15.  The Mapping Tables

   The Label Information Base (LIB) contains information about labels
   learned by the LSR.  The LIB for LDP, CR-LDP and MPLS-RSVP (i.e. all
   currently defined MPLS protocols) is represented in the LSR MIB [23].
   The LIB is represented by the LSR MIB's mplsXCTable (mpls Cross
   Connect Table), mplsInSegmentTable (mpls In Segment (ingress label)
   Table) and the mplsOutSegmentTable (mpls Out Segment (egress label)
   Table).  The mplsXCTable models the cross-connection of the ingress
   label with a specific egress-label.  The mplsInSegmentTable stores
   the ingress label's information, and the mplsOutSegmentTable stores
   the egress label's information.

   The LDP Session that created the LSP and the LSP's (ingress label,
   egress label) pair along with other information is contained in the
   LSR MIB's mplsXCTable, the mplsInSegmentTable and the
   mplsOutSegmentTable.

   In order to utilize the LSR MIB's mplsXCTable, mplsInSegmentTable and
   mplsOutSegmentTable for LDP sessions, there needed to be a mechanism
   to associate (or map) LDP sessions with LDP LSPs created as a result
   of those LDP sessions.  The mapping tables in this MIB
   (mplsLdpSesInLabelMapTable, mplsLdpSesOutLabelMapTable and
   mplsLdpSesXCMapTable) are used to associate LDP LSP information in
   this MIB, with the relevant entries in the LSR MIB.

   The mplsInSegmentTable, the mplsOutSegmentTable and the mplsXCTable
   in the LSR MIB could contain rows which were created as a result of
   an LDP LSPs.  Three mapping tables were added to this MIB to map LDP
   Sessions to these tables in the LSR MIB.  These mapping tables are
   described in the next few subsections.  Please note, these mapping
   tables are optional and need only to be implemented if the
   mplsInSegmentTable, mplsOutSegmentTable and mplsXCTable from the LSR
   MIB are implemented.

   In order to expedite development, these mapping objects have been

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                   August 2001


   made optional in the conformance section of the MIB.

   As discussed in the section, "Changing Values after Session
   Establishment", if a session is torn down, then all the information
   related to this session, must be removed from the both LDP MIB and,
   if implemented, from the LSR MIB.


3.6.15.1.  The LDP Session In Label Map Table

   The mplsLdpSesInLabelMapTable provides a way to map LDP LSPs in the
   LSR MIB's mplsInSegmentTable to the LDP session which created them in
   this MIB's mplsLdpSessionTable.  When a session is torn down, the
   mapping table, mplsLdpSesInLabelMapTable, provides a way to clean up
   the related LDP entries in the mplsInSegmentTable.  If an LSP is
   terminated on this LSR then there will be an entry in the mapping
   table which maps the session and the entry in the mplsInSegmentTable.
   Please note, there may be entries which are also effected by session
   teardown in the mplsXCTable. (The relationship between the
   mplsInSegmentTable and the mplsXCTable and cleanup scenarios will
   need to be handled and are outside of the scope of this MIB.)

   This table is optional and only needs to be implemented if the LSR
   MIB's mplsInSegmentTable and/or mplsXCTable are implemented.


3.6.15.2.  The LDP Session Out Label Map Table

   The mplsLdpSesOutLabelMapTable provides a way to map a LDP LSPs in
   the LSR MIB's mplsOutSegmentTable to the LDP session which created
   them in this MIB's mplsLdpSessionTable.  When a session is torn down,
   the mapping table, mplsLdpSesOutLabelMapTable, provides a way to
   clean up the related LDP entries in the mplsOutSegmentTable.  If an
   LSP is created by this LSR then there will be an entry in this table
   which maps the session and the entry in the mplsOutSegmentTable.
   Please note, there may be entries which are also effected by session
   teardown in the mplsXCTable.  (The relationship between the
   mplsOutSegmentTable and the mplsXCTable and cleanup scenarios will
   need to be handled and are outside the scope of this MIB.)

   This table is optional and only needs to be implemented if the LSR
   MIB's mplsOutSegmentTable and/or mplsXCTable are implemented.


3.6.15.3.  The LDP Session XC Map Table

   The mplsLdpSesXCMapTable provides a way to map LDP LSPs in the LSR
   MIB's mplsXCTable to the LDP session which created them in this MIB's
   mplsLdpSessionTable. When a session is torn down, the mapping table,
   mplsLdpSesXCMapTable, provides a way to clean up the related LDP

   entries in the mplsXCTable.  If an LSP is cross-connected on this
   LSR, then there will be an entry in this mapping table which maps the
   session and the entry in the mplsXCTable. Please note, only true
   cross-connects are represented in the mplsLdpSesXCMapTable.

   This table is optional and only needs to be implemented if the LSR
   MIB's mplsXCTable is implemented.


3.6.16.  The FEC Table

   The FEC Table is a table which contains FEC (Forwarding Equivalence
   Class) information.  Each entry/row represents a single FEC Element.
   There is also a FEC Mapping table which maps FECs associated with the
   Cross-connects.


3.7.  The LDP Notifications Group


3.7.1.  LDP Notifications

   Currently, there are several notifications which are specific for
   LDP.  These are described in this section.

   The mplsLdpInitSesThresholdExceeded notification indicates to the
   operator that there may be a misconfigured mplsLdpEntityEntry because
   the session associated with this Entity is not being established, and
   the Entity keeps trying to establish the session.  A side effect of
   this situation is that a row in the mplsLdpSessionTable may not be
   reaching the operational state as indicated by the mplsLdpSesState
   object.  If the value of mplsLdpEntityInitSesThreshold is 0 (zero)
   then this is equal to specifying the value of inifinity for the
   threshold, and the mplsLdpInitSesThresholdExceeded Trap will never be
   sent.

   The object, mplsLdpEntityPVLMisTrapEnabled is used to enable or
   disable the sending of the mplsLdpPVLMismatch trap.  If enabled, then
   this trap is sent when there is a mismatch in the Path Vector Limits
   between the Entity and Peer during session initialization between
   that Entity and that Peer. In this situation a session could still be
   established between that entity and that peer.  The session uses the
   value which is configured as the Entity's Path Vector Limit.
   However, a trap should be sent to indicate that a mismatch occurred.
   For further details, please see Section 3.5.3 of the LDP
   Specification [18].

   The object, mplsLdpSesUpDownTrapEnable is used to enable or disable
   the sending of the mplsLdpSessionUp and mplsLdpSessionDown traps.  If
   enabled, then these traps are sent when there is an appropriate

   mplsLdpSessionUp trap).

             Range Table.  One entry in this table contains
             information on a single range of labels
             represented by the configured Upper and Lower
             Bounds VPI/VCI pairs.  These are the same
             data used in the Initialization Message.

             NOTE:  The ranges for a specific LDP Entity
             are UNIQUE and non-overlapping.  For example,
             for a specific LDP Entity index, there could
             be one entry having ConfLowerBound vpi/vci == 0/32, and
             ConfUpperBound vpi/vci == 0/100, and a second entry
             for this same interface with ConfLowerBound
             vpi/vci == 0/101 and ConfUpperBound vpi/vci == 0/200.
             However, there could not be a third entry with
             ConfLowerBound vpi/vci == 0/200 and
             ConfUpperBound vpi/vci == 0/300 because this label
             range overlaps with the second entry (i.e. both
             entries now have 0/200).

             A row will not be created unless a unique and
             non-overlapping range is specified.  Thus, row
             creation implies a one-shot row creation of
             LDP EntityID and ConfLowerBound vpi/vci and

5.  Revision History

   This section should be removed when this document is published as an
   RFC.


5.1.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-07.txt>

   There were three types of changes:  the first change was that all the
   MPLS Textual Conventions from this MIB, the LSR and MPLS-TE MIBs were
   moved into a new document [36], "draft-ietf-mpls-tc-mib-00.txt".  The
   Textual Conventions are now IMPORTED from [36]. The second type of
   change was updates based on comments from the IESG.  These changes
   will be discussed below.  The third type of changes were based on
   minor editorial changes from the co-authors.

   The "Introduction" and "Structure of the MIB" sections were reworded
   since they were repetitive.

   The "Overview" was rearranged.

   References were added to "The LDP Entity ATM Objects" and "The LDP
   Entity Frame Relay Objects" Sections.

   The Working Group mailing list and Chairs were added to the CONTACT-
   INFO.

   Updated the DESCRIPTION clause for the "mplsLdpEntityLdpId" object.

   Updated the mplsLdpEntityProtocolVersion to include a range
   (1..65535).

   Updated the "References" Section.

   Running the MIB through the smilint MIB compiler showed that some
   object names were longer than 32 characters, these were shortened to
   32 characters or fewer.

   The following changes were from the co-authors.

   Other minor editorial changes such as fixing typographical errors,
   and removing MIB comments which are no longer meaningful.

   Page 17 (also page 46) the description was enhanced to describe the
   version field in the LDP header from RFC3036.

   Removed WellKnown from the tcp and upd port names. It's the ports
   that get set, and the default value is the well known (actually the
   registered) port number.

   mplsLdpEntityInitSesTrapEnable object is useless and was removed
   since setting mplsLdpEntityInitSesThreshold=0 acheives the same
   thing.  Also removed it from the descriptive text in section 3.

   Page 47, mplsLdpSessionDiscontinuityTime The initial value of this
   was changed to be sysUpTime instead of zero.  sysUpTime for when the
   session starts is more meaningful and was added to the Session
   Up/Down Traps also.  Also, added the Session specific stats to the
   up/down traps.


5.2.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-06.txt>

   All changes were from the second last call which took place Thursday,
   July 20th, until Thursday, July 27th, 2000 and are described in the
   remainder of this section.

   Remove the reference to the MPLS framework document.

   Add an mplsFecIndexNext type of object.

   Change the conformance of the FEC table objects to be part of the
   mplsLdpGeneralGroup.

   The mplsLdpEntityConfGenericTable is no longer needed because the
   functionality has been absorbed by the
   mplsLdpEntityConfGenericLabelRangeTable. The
   mplsLdpEntityConfGenericTable has been removed and the front section
   was updated accordingly.

   Other editorial issues, updating references, typos and so forth.


5.3.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-05.txt>

   The majority of changes in this revision are based on Last Call
   comments which were received during the last call from Thursday,
   March 9, 2000 to Friday, March 17, 2000, or slightly thereafter.
   Also, changes were made to agree with the latest specifications.
   These changes are described in this section.

   Changes due to draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-07.txt and draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-
   08.txt. Specifically, removing references to IPv4/IP and using router
   id, as appropriate.

   Removed vpMerge and vpAndVcMerge choices from the object,
   mplsLdpEntityAtmMergeCap.  VP Merge is not described in [30].

   The LIB Table was removed and replaced by mapping tables to map LDP
   LSPs created by LDP sessions to the mplsInSegment, mplsOutSegment and

   mplsXC  tables in the LSR MIB.  The conformance section was updated
   to include a Mapping Group which is to be implemented iff these LSR
   MIB tables (mplsInSegmentTable, mplsOutSegmentTable and mplsXCTable)
   are implemented.

   The front section was updated to include information on the Generic
   label table.

   Added more in the front section on on Row
   Creation/adminStatus/OperStatus in the LDP Entity and related tables.

   Added a generic label range table. NOTE: there is NO corresponding
   LDP message which relates to the information in this table, however,
   this table does provide a way for a user to 'reserve' a generic label
   range.

   A new TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, MplsAtmVcIdentifier was added.  This TC has
   the same upper bounds as AtmVcIdentifier (from rfc2514) except that
   the lower bound is 32 (and not 0).  The lower bound is 32 since this
   value is specified by [30].

   Removed the scalar object mplsLsrLabelRetentionMode and added
   mplsLdpEntityLabelRetentionMode.  The change was made to allow
   configuring the retention mode on a per LDP Entity basis, as opposed
   for the entire LSR.

   Typo in section 3.5.2 was fixed.

   Typo in the mplsLdpSessionUp notification description was fixed.

   Section 'LDP Notifications' was expanded to cover both the
   'mplsLdpSessionUp' and 'mplsLdpSessionDown' traps.  Also, the objects
   which enable and disable these traps have been described in this
   Section:

   The 'mplsLdpEntityHopCountLoopDetection' object and the
   'mplsLdpEntityHopCount' object have been combined into the new
   object, 'mplsLdpEntityHopCountLimit'.

   MplsLabel has been updated to reflect the VPI value of 12 bits and
   not 8.

   Added DEFVAL clause to the 'mplsLdpEntityWellKnownDiscoveryPort'
   object.  The default value is 646.

   Added UNITS and DEFVAL clauses to the 'mplsLdpEntityMaxPduLength'
   object.  The default value is 4096 and the units is octets.

   Added DEFVAL clause to 'mplsLdpEntityProtocolVersion' object.  The
   default value is 1.

    Added DEFVAL clause to 'mplsLdpEntityKeepAliveHoldTimer' of 40
   seconds.

   Added DEFVAL clause to 'mplsLdpEntityInitSesThreshold' object.  The
   default value is 8.

   The mplsLdpEntityWellKnownDiscoveryPort was changed into two objects,
   one for TCP and one for UDP.  The names are

   The mplsLdpEntityPeerTable was (re-)named mplsLdpPeerTable.  The
   mplsLdpSessionTable now AUGMENTs the mplsLdpPeerTable in order to
   show that these two tables are related.  There has been wording added
   to the mplsLdpSessionEntry description and to the description for the
   mplsLdpPeerTable.


5.4.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-04.txt>

   Editorial changes, fixing typo's, fixing wrapping lines, etc.

   Updated references for latest drafts, and added [31] and [32] to
   Reference Section.

   Added to the Acknowledgements Section.

   Changed the SYNTAX and DESCRIPTION of the
   'mplsLdpLsrLoopDetectionCapable' object, so that it will also support
   the loop detection by hop count.

   Combined the 'mplsLdpEntityLoopDetectionForPV' and 'mplsLdpEntityPVL'
   objects.  The functionality of the 'mplsLdpEntityLoopDectionForPV' is
   now denoted by the value of 0 (zero) in the 'mplsLdpEntityPVL'
   object.  This results in one less object
   'mplsLdpEntityLoopDectionForPV' but does not sacrifice functionality.

   Changed 'mplsLdpLibLabelType' into two objects:
   'mplsLdpLibInLabelType' and differ from the egress label type.  The
   MIB now reflects this.

   The following items were changed as a result of the Frame Relay Forum
   dropping support for 17-bit DLCIs:  the MplsLabel TC description has
   been modified, and other Frame Relay Object descriptions were also
   modified (as specified in this section).

   The MplsLabel TC was also modified and reference 3. was added to the
   REFERENCE Clause.

   MplsLdpLabelTypes TC was modified to use an enum.

   InterfaceIndex support was added to the Entity information.  This was
   specifically requested by several members of the working group.  An
   additional table, mplsLdpEntityConfGenericTable as a way to configure
   Generic Labels, and an object, 'mplsLdpConfGenericIfIndexOrZero was
   added to map the InterfaceIndex used by Generic Labels.  Objects were
   also added to the 'mplsLdpEntityAtmParmsTable' and the and
   'mplsLdpEntityFrIfIndex', respectively.

   Changed the name of the 'mplsLdpEntityMtu' object to be
   'mplsLdpEntityMaxPduLength' which is more consistent with the LDP
   Specification.  Also, the description and SYNTAX were changed.

   Changed the SYNTAX of the 'mplsLdpSessionMaxPduLength' to unsigned32
   and changed the Range from (0..65535) to (1..65535).

   Added and improved the front section discussion on SNMP
   Notifications.

   Also, modified the DESCRIPTION clause of the

   Added objects to enable/disable the sending of traps:

   Added an object to enable/disable sending traps for Sessions changing
   from Up to Down, or Down to Up.

   Added notifications to generate traps from session changing from Up
   to Down, or Down to up.

   Added a StorageType object to the Entity and associated tables which
   are configurable.

   Added a Discontinuity Time object to the Entity Table,

   Added discussion on row creation in the Entity and other associated
   Entity tables.  This is a new Section in the Front part of the
   document called:

   Removed the 'mplsLdpEntityControlMethod'.

   Made 'mplsLdpFecLspId' as part of the INDEX for the FEC table.  This
   is to allow FECs to map to multiple LSPs.  Also add a RowPointer to a
   row in the Session Table.

   Added an operation status object, 'mplsLdpLspOperStatus' and a last
   Change object, 'mplsLdpLspLastChangeto the LIB Table.  This will be
   used to detect whether an LSP has changed its status.

   Changed the name of the mplsLdpPeerTable to the
   mplsLdpEntityPeerTable.  This table contains information relevant to
   Peers which are known to specific Entities.  The indexing of this

   table has also changed to include the Row in the Entity Table that
   this Peer is known by.  The mplsLdpHelloAdjacencyTable and the
   mplsLdpSessionTable have been moved under this table.  Since Hello
   Adjacencies are related to Entity-Peer information and Sessions are
   related to Entity-Peer information this was seen as a comprehensive
   and coherent modelling.  Associated descriptions in the front section
   and in the tables have been changed to reflect this change.

   Moved the 'mplsLdpConfFrLen' object from the
   'mplsLdpEntityConfFrLabelRangeTable' to the
   'mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayParmsTable' since the Frame Relay
   interface/port can only use one header length at a time, i.e. a
   specific FR interface supports one address length for all VCs on that
   interface. Also, changed the object so that it only supports 10 and
   23 bit DLCI lengths. (The 17 bit length was dropped by the Frame
   Relay Forum and thus, is no longer required.)  The name of this
   object was changed from 'mplsLdpConfFrLen' to 'mplsLdpEntityFrLen' to
   fit in with the 'mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayParmsTable'.

   Removed the seventeenDlciBits(1) value from the mplsLdpFrSessionLen
   object.  (The 17 bit length was dropped by the Frame Relay Forum and
   thus, is no longer required.)

   Corrected the range of the 'mplsLdpEntityIndexNext' object to include
   0 (zero).


5.5.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-03.txt>

   Reworded the description of the mplsLdpAtmSessionTable to clarify
   that one or MORE label range intersection(s) is/are represented in
   this table.

   Reworded the description of the mplsLdpFrameRelaySessionTable to
   clarify that one or MORE label range intersection(s) is/are
   represented in this table.

   Added a new index, mplsLdpSessionPeerIndex, to the
   mplsLdpSessionPeerAddressTable.  This new index uniquely identifies
   the entry within a given session.  (Since  adding
   mplsLdpSessionPeerNextHopAddressType,
   mplsLdpSessionPeerNextHopAddress to the INDEX clause of the
   mplsLdpSessionPeerAddressTable leaves a table with only indices and
   no objects, the work around was to add a new index which uniquely
   differentiates an entry within a given session.)

   Quite a few changes to the mplsLdpPeerTable. First, removed the
   mplsLdpPeerIndex from the mplsLdpPeerTable and other tables.  This
   index served no purpose, so was removed.  Second, removed the
   objects:  mplsLdpPeerInternetworkAddrType, and

   mplsLdpPeerInternetworkAddr. Third, reworded the description of this
   table to include information which is known during Session
   Intialization attempts, the specific information has to do with Loop
   Dection based on Path Vectors.  Since Section 3.5.3 of the LDP Spec
   when describing the PVLim says:  "Although knowledge of a peer's path
   vector limit will not change an LSR's behavior, it does enable the
   LSR to alert an operator to a possible misconfiguration." and the
   object mplsLdpPeerPVL is sent as a varbind in the mplsLdpPVLMismatch
   notification.

   Removed the mplsLdpPeerIndex from the mplsLdpHelloAdjacencyTable.

   Removed the "IANA Address Family Numbers" MIB section.

   Updated the boiler.me from the ops web page dated Weds., Dec 22,
   1999.

   Updated the Security Section from the ops web page.

   Added the following objects to the mplsLdpEntityTable:
   mplsLdpEntityControlMethod, mplsLdpEntityLoopDectionForPV, and
   mplsLdpEntityPathVectorLimit.

   Removed mplsLdpSessionLabelAdvertisement,
   mplsLdpSessionLoopDetectionForPV, and mplsLdpSessionPathVectorLimit
   from the mplsLdpSessionTable.

   Changed the mplsLdpPathVectorLimitMismatch Notification to send
   mplsLdpEntityPathVectorLimit (instead of
   mplsLdpSessionPathVectorLimit).

   Copied the MplsLabel TC from draft-ietf-mpls-lsr-mib-00.txt and
   replaced the MplsLdpGenAddr for mplsLdpLibInLabel and
   mpslLdpLibOutLabel with MplsLabel.

   The mplsLdpSessionIndex was removed throughout the MIB. This was
   replaced by the object mplsLdpSessionDiscontinuityTime.  The
   motivation was to reduce the number of indices.

   The descriptions for the objects in the mplsLdpSessionStatsTable,
   mplsLdpSessionStatsUnknownMessageTypeErrors and
   mplsLdpSessionStatsUnknownTlvErrors, have been updated to include a
   reference to the mplsLdpSessionDiscontinuityTime object.

   mplsLdpEntityProtocolVersion, mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus,
   mplsLdpEntityOperStatus, mplsLdpEntityTargetedPeer,
   mplsLdpEntityTargetedPeerAddrType, mplsLdpEntityTargetedPeerAddr, and

   mplsLdpEntityAtmLsrConnectivity, mplsLdpEntityDefaultControlVpi,
   mplsLdpEntityDefaultControlVci, mplsLdpEntityUnlabTrafVpi, and
   mplsLdpEntityUnlabTrafVci.  NOTE:  the last four objects were in
   Version 01 of the MIB but were mistakenly omitted from Version 02.
   Now, they are back.

   Changed the indexing of the mplsLdpEntityConfAtmLabelRangeTable to
   include the minimum VPI/VCI.  This is to ensure that indices in this
   table are unique.

   Changed the indexing of the mplsLdpEntityConfFrLabelRangeTable, to
   include the minimum DLCI value.  This is to ensure that indices in
   this table are unique.

   Added [30] to Reference Section.


5.7.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-01.txt>

   The MIB was updated to correspond to draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-06.txt of
   the LDP Specification [18].

   The front section was updated.

   The MIB was made to be less ATM-centric.  Essentially, the ATM
   specific objects where removed from the tables and placed in ATM
   specific Tables.  A type was added to the base tables and a row is to
   be created in the ATM/FR/etc.  type table.  Apropos compliance
   statements were added to reflect the separation of ATM and Frame
   Relay objects into their respective tables.

   Objects for Loop Detection were removed from describing the LDP
   implementation (i.e. the scalars were removed) and Loop Dection
   objects were added to the Session Table.  (Although as the LDP
   Specification indicates loop detection should be for an LSR within a
   domain.)

   The following tables were added:  mplsLdpEntityAtmParmsTable,
   mplsLdpEntityConfAtmLabelRangeTable, mplsLdpFrameRelayParmsTable,
   mplsLdpConfFrLabelRangeTable, mplsLdpAtmSessionTable,
   mpslLdpFrameRelaySessionTable, mplsLdpSessionPeerAddressTable,
   mplsLdpLibTable, and the mplsLdpFecTable.

   removal.

   The following objects were removed from the Session Table:
   mplsLdpSessionRole was removed (this can be determined by comparing
   LSR Ids and does not need to be explicitely in the MIB.)  ATM
   specific objects (mplsLdpSessionAtmLabelRangeLowerBoundVpi
   mplsLdpSessionAtmLabelRangeLowerBoundVci,
   mplsLdpSessionAtmLabelRangeUpperBoundVpi
   mplsLdpSessionAtmLabelRangeUpperBoundVci) were removed and put into a

   Hello Adjacency Table was updated.

   The objects, mplsLdpSessionRejectedParamErrors,
   mplsLdpSessionRejectedNoHelloErrors, mplsLdpBadLdpIdentifierErrors,
   mplsLdpBadPduLengthErrors, mplsLdpBadMessageLengthErrors,
   mplsLdpBadTlvLengthErrors, mplsLdpMalformedTlvValueErrors,
   mplsLdpKeepAliveTimerExpiredErrors, mplsLdpShutdownNotifReceived, and
   mplsLdpShutdownNotifSent were added to the mplsLdpEntityStatsTable.

   The mplsLdpSessionStatsTable was added to count statics based on a
   per Session basis.

   The mplLdpPeerConfAtmLabelRangeTable has been removed.  There is no
   need to configure information for a Peer.  All information for a peer
   is learned, thus peer information is read-only.

   (Editorial) References were updated to reflect the documents which
   this version was based on.


5.8.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-00.txt>

   Textual conventions were added for the LSR Identifier and the LDP
   Identifier.

   Top-level mib structure was added. The LDP MIB falls under a proposed
   hierarchy of mpls.mplsProtocols.

   The mib hierarchy within the LDP MIB was also changed.  A new branch,
   under mpls.mplsProtocols.mplsLdpMIB.mplsLdpObjects was added.  This
   branch is mplsLdpLsrObjects.  Currently, this contains several new
   scalar objects:  mplsLdpLsrID, mplsLdpLsrLoopDetectionPresent,
   mplsLdpLsrLoopDetectinAdminStatus, mplsLdpLsrPathVectorLimit,
   mplsLdpLsrHopCountLimit, mplsLdpLsrLoopPreventionPresent,
   mplsLdpLsrLoopPreventionAdminStatus, and
   mplsLdpLsrLabelRetentionMode.

   mplsLdpEntityTable is now indexed by mplsLdpEntityIdentifier, which

   is the LDP Identifier used in Session establishment.
   mplsLdpEntityLoopDetection and mplsLdpEntityLoopPrevention objects
   were removed from this table.

   The following objects were added to the mplsLdpEntityTable:
   mplsLdpEntityLabelSpaceType, mplsLdpEntityUnlabTrafVpi,
   mplsLdpEntityUnlabTrafVci, mplsLdpEntityMergeCapability,
   mplsLdpEntityVcDirectionality, and
   mplsLdpEntityLabelDistributionMethod.

   The following objects were added to the mplsLdpPeerEntityTable:
   mplsLdpPeerLabelDistributionMethod.

   The following object was removed from the mplsLdpEntityStatsTable:
   mplsLdpEntityEstablishedSessions.

   References were added and revised.

8.  Security Considerations


There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may
   be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.


There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information. These are contained in the mplsLdpEntityTable.
   The objects contained in this table are responsible for setting up or


Expires February 2002                                          [Page 81]

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                   August 2001


   tearing down LSPs.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.


SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
