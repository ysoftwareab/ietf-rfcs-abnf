     ABSTRACT
     
     IETF specifications do not receive formal review until
     they are submitted to the IESG. Hence, significant
     problems with a specification often are not detected
     until considerable effort has been wasted and changes
     to fix the problems are difficult to add. The procedure
     described in this document is intended to solve, or
     palliate, a number of related problems that have been
     observed in the IETF process. The basic model is to
     create a team of Senior IETF Reviewers (SIRS), and have
     all documents receive a certain number of reviews by
     SIRs, prior to being submitted for publication. Review
     at a very early stage is strongly encouraged.
     
     
     
     STATUS OF THIS MEMO
     
     This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full
     conformance with all provisions of Section 10 of
     RFC2026.
     
     Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet
     Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its
     working groups.  Note that other groups may also
     distribute working documents as Internet Drafts.
     
     Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum
     of six months and may be updated, replaced, or
     obsoleted by other documents at any time.  It is
     inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference
     material or to cite them other than as "work in
     progress."

     Introduction
     
     IETF specifications do not receive formal review until
     they are submitted to the IESG. Hence, significant
     problems with a specification often are not detected
     until considerable effort has been wasted and changes
     to fix the problems are difficult to add.  We can
     speculate that this problem explains a large part of
     the long tail in the distribution of IESG document
     approval times, as well as a perception that the IESG
     has too much authority.
     
     The procedure described in this document is intended to
     solve, or palliate, a number of related problems that
     have been observed in the IETF process [PROBLEM]:
          
          *    overload of the IESG (leading to delay)

          *    perception that authority and influence 
               in the IETF are concentrated in too few 
               hands

          *    submission of documents to the IESG that 
               still have significant problems (leading 
               to delay)

          *    failure to detect fundamental problems 
               and Internet- wide issues at an early 
               stage
     
     Particularly because of the last point, it is
     impossible to resolve all these problems simply by
     giving additional responsibility to working groups
     themselves. An additional procedure is needed.
     
     The procedure specified here calls for a team of 'sirs'
     to 'card'.  The term 'card' is used for textiles and
     pubs.  The former usage removes detritus from textiles
     and prepares it for weaving.  The latter vets
     participants at the door. The term also is an acronym
     for 'Careful Additional Review of Documents.'
     
     The carding procedure initially makes no change to the
     formal process of IETF document development, review,
     approval, and publication. It is an additional
     procedure intended to tackle the problems listed above.
     If successful, it can be transformed into a formal
     process in due course.
     
     The basic model is that the IETF will create a team of
     Senior IETF Reviewers (SIRs, who need be neither male
     nor knighted) chosen in a way designed to create trust,
     and that all documents must receive a certain number of
     reviews by SIRs, prior to being submitted to the IESG
     or the RFC Editor for publication. Furthermore, review
     at a very early stage is strongly encouraged.
     
     The model is intended to be compatible with, and
     complementary to, existing mechanisms such as the
     various Directorates within the IETF and the MIB Doctor
     system.
     
     The remainder of this document described how the team
     of SIRs is created and refreshed, how the review
     process works, and how it is used by document authors
     and working groups to achieve their objectives.



2.   SIRS


2.1. The Body of Senior Internet Reviewers
     
     2.1.1.    Initial Set of SIRs
     
     With approximately 200 RFCs published per year, and
     with most of them having existed in multiple Internet
     Drafts, a large team of SIRs is needed.
     
     A target of 100 people is suggested.
     
     The goal is to identify a team of people with adequate
     experience contributing to IETF technical work, who are
     likely to be trusted as a group to be both technically
     expert and unbiased.
     
     The initial team is defined by objective criteria, to
     avoid any bias in their selection. It will consist of:
          
          *    all current IAB members

          *    all former IAB and IESG members, and former 
               WG Chairs, who the Secretariat can contact 
               and who are willing to serve

          *    all current MIB Doctors

          *    all members of existing IETF Directorates

          *    all authors of at least three RFCs, who the 
               Secretariat can contact and who are willing 
               to serve

          *    (other suggestions???)
     
     (Current IESG Area Directors are excluded from the
     pool.)
     
     2.1.2.    Addition and Removal of SIRs
     
     The team of SIRs is augmented each year [[schedule
     TBD]] by a public nomination process and a voting
     procedure (TBD) among the existing SIRs.
     
     SIRs who do not produce at least [[five ??]] reviews in
     a given year will be retired from the team. In
     extremis, SIR status may be removed by a simple
     majority vote of the team of SIRs.


2.2. Obtaining SIR Participation
     
     For Working Group documents, Working Groups solicit the
     assistance of SIRs.  That is, the general IETF
     community controls who is authorized as a SIR, but WGs
     control which specific SIRs provides the formal review
     that is needed for a given document.
     
     A primary goal of this proposal is to ensure that
     Working Groups benefit from broad experience in the
     design of Internet technology. Hence it is entirely
     reasonable that some SIRs reviewing a given document
     should be subject matter experts. However the full set
     of input from SIRs is substantially more useful when it
     includes SIRs from other areas.  In particular, cross-
     area review makes it more likely that architectural and
     operational impacts outside of the subject matter will
     be detected.  It is therefore strongly recommended that
     WGs seek a diverse set of SIRs to participate in
     evaluations, able to cover most if not all IETF Areas
     between them.
     
     Each WG will make its own decision about how its SIRs
     are selected (e.g. chosen by the WG Chairs, chosen by
     the document authors concerned, etc.)
     
     For individual submissions, the document author(s) will
     solicit SIR reviews, according to the same principles
     applied to Working Group documents.
     
     There is no fixed number of SIR reviews required prior
     to submission to the IESG or the RFC Editor. However,
     it is likely that drafts with at least three positive
     reviews from SIRs in different areas will experience
     much shorter IESG review cycles than drafts with fewer
     positive reviews. Other common sense rules will apply;
     for example a MIB that has not been reviewed by a MIB
     Doctor is unlikely to be published.
     
     In all likelihood, Drafts without reviews will get
     worse IESG response time than today, whereas Drafts
     with reviews will be processed much more rapidly,
     especially as the IESG's confidence in the SIR
     procedure increases.



3.   CARDING


3.1. Reviewing in Public
     
     The current list of SIRs will be available on the IETF
     web site. All reviews will be published on the web
     site, with adequate tooling (similar to or linked to
     the ID Tracker) so that every review can be readily
     found. In fact, a WG or document author in need of
     reviews should be able to request them through the web
     site.


3.2. Form of a Review
     
     Each review must start with a summary statement chosen
     from or adapted from the following list:
          
          *    This draft is ready for publication as a 
               [type] RFC.

          *    This draft is on the right track but has 
               open issues, described in the review.

          *    This draft has serious issues, described 
               in the review, and needs to be rethought.

          *    This draft has very fundamental issues, 
               described in the review, and further work 
               is not recommended.
     
     The length of a review will vary greatly according to
     circumstances, and it is acceptable for purely
     editorial comments to be sent privately. All
     substantive comments must be included in the public
     review.
     
     SIRs should review for all kinds of problems, from
     basic architectural or security issues, Internet-wide
     impact, technical nits, problems of form and format
     (such as IANA Considerations or incorrect references),
     and editorial issues. As a draft progresses from its
     initial, "-00" version towards one that is ready for
     submission, successive SIR reviews should progress from
     the general architectural level to the editorial level.
     
     The intention is that before a draft is submitted by a
     WG to the IESG, or by an individual to the RFC Editor,
     it has already benefited from a level of review
     equivalent to that traditionally applied by the IESG.


3.3. Iterative Carding
     
     The carding of textiles is an iterative process, and so
     is the carding of documents by SIRs. It is not required
     that every version of an Internet Draft should be
     submitted for SIR review. However, it is advisable to
     request reviews at the very beginning (to check for
     fundamental issues), as major technical issues are
     resolved, and again just before the document is
     submitted for IESG approval. Thus three SIR review
     cycles per document may be considered the minimum.
     
     Both Working Groups and individual submitters should
     realise that carding should start early (to detect and
     hopefully fix fundamental problems) and be repeated as
     often as needed (to avoid submitting inadequate
     documents to the IESG). By these means, it should be
     possible to avoid most cases where a document spends a
     long time in IESG review or, worse, is fundamentally
     unacceptable to the IESG.
