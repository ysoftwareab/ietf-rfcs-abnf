                 TRILL: Interface Addresses APPsub-TLV
                 <draft-ietf-trill-ia-appsubtlv-06.txt>



Abstract
   This document specifies a TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots
   of Links) IS-IS application sub-TLV that enables the reporting by a
   TRILL switch of sets of addresses. Each set of addresses reports all
   of the addresses that designate the same interface (port) and also
   reports the TRILL switch by which that interface is reachable. For
   example, a 48-bit MAC (Media Access Control) address, IPv4 address,
   and IPv6 address can be reported as all corresponding to the same
   interface reachable by a particular TRILL switch. Such information
   could be used in some cases to synthesize responses to or by-pass the
   need for the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), the IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery (ND) protocol, or the flooding of unknown MAC addresses.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      TRILL: IA APPsub-TLV


1. Introduction

   This document specifies a TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots
   of Links) [RFC6325] IS-IS application sub-TLV (APPsub-TLV [RFC6823])
   that enables the convenient representation of sets of addresses where
   all of the addresses in each set designate the same interface (port).
   For example, a 48-bit MAC (Media Access Control [RFC7042]) address,
   IPv4 address, and IPv6 address can be reported as all three
   designating the same interface.  In addition, a Data Label (VLAN or
   Fine Grained Label (FGL [RFC7172])) is specified for the interface
   along with the TRILL switch, and optionally the TRILL switch port,
   from which the interface is reachable.  Such information could be
   used in some cases to synthesize responses to or by-pass the need for
   the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP [RFC826]), the IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery (ND [RFC4861]) protocol, the Reverse Address Resolution
   Protocol (RARP [RFC903]), or the flooding of unknown destination MAC
   addresses.  If the information reported is complete, it can also be
   used to detect and discard packets with forged source addresses.

   This APPsub-TLV appears inside the TRILL GENINFO TLV specified in the
   ESADI RFC [RFC7357] but may also occur in other application contexts.
   Directory Assisted TRILL Edge services [DirectoryScheme] are expected
   to make use of this APPsub-TLV.

   Although, in some IETF protocols, address field types are represented
   by Ethertype [RFC7042] or Hardware Type [RFC5494], only Address
   Family Number (AFN) is used in this APPsub-TLV to represent address
   field type.

2. Format of the Interface Addresses APPsub-TLV

   The Interface Addresses (IA) APPsub-TLV is used to advertise a set of
   addresses indicating the same interface (port) within a Data Label
   (VLAN or FGL) and to associate that interface with the TRILL switch,
   and optionally the TRILL switch port, by which the interface is
   reachable.  These addresses can be in different address families.
   For example, it can be used to declare that a particular interface
   with specified IPv4, IPv6, and 48-bit MAC addresses in some
   particular Data Label is reachable from a particular TRILL switch.
   While those three types of address are likely to be the only types of
   interest, any address type for which an AFN (Address Family Number)
   has been assigned by IANA can be represented.

   The Template field in a particular Interface Addresses APPsub-TLV
   indicates the format of each Address Set it carries. Certain well-
   known sets of addresses are represented by special values. Other sets
   of addresses are specified by a list of AFNs. The Template format
   that uses a list of AFNs provides an explicit pattern for the type
   and order of addresses in each Address Set in the IA APPsub-TLV that
   includes that Template.

   A device or application making use of IA APPsub-TLV data is not
   required to make use of all IA data. For example, a device or
   application that was only interested in MAC and IPv6 addresses could
   ignore any IPv4 or other types of address information that was
   present.

   The figure below shows an IA APPsub-TLV as it would appear inside an
   IS-IS FS-LSP using an extended flooding scope [RFC7356] TLV, for
   example in ESADI [RFC7357].  Within an IS-IS FS-LSP using traditional
   [ISO-10589] TLVs, the Type and Length would be one byte unsigned
   integers equal to or less than 255 but with an extended TLV the Type
   and Length are a two byte unsigned integer.

                 Figure 1. The Interface Addresses APPsub-TLV

   o  Type: Interface Addresses TRILL APPsub-TLV type, set to TBD1 (IA-
      SUBTLV).

   o  Length: Variable, minimum 7. If length is 6 or less or if the
      APPsub-TLV extends beyond the size of an encompassing TRILL
      GENINFO TLV or other context, the APPsub-TLV MUST be ignored.

   o  Addr Sets End: The unsigned integer offset of the byte, within the
      IA APPsub-TLV value part, of the last byte of the last Address
      Set. This will be the byte just before the first sub-sub-TLV if
      any sub-sub-TLVs are present (see Section 3). The processing is as
      follows:
       - If this field is greater than Length or points to before the
         end of the Template, the IA APPsub-TLV is corrupt and MUST be
         discarded.
       - If this field is equal to Length, there are no sub-sub-TLVs.
       - If this field is less than Length, sub-sub-TLVs are parsed as
         specified in Section 3.
      Note: This field is always two bytes in size.

   o  Nickname: The nickname of the TRILL switch by which the address
      sets are reachable. If zero, the address sets are reachable from

      the TRILL switch originating the message containing the APPsub-TLV
      (for example, an ESADI [RFC7357] message).

   o  Flags: A byte of flags as follows:

          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |D|L|   RESV    |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         D: Directory flag: If D is one, the APPsub-TLV contains
            Directory information [RFC7067].

         L: Local flag: If L is one, the APPsub-TLV contains information
            learned locally by observing ingressed frames [RFC6325].
            (Both D and L can be set to one in the same IA APPsub-TLV if
            a TRILL switch that had learned an address locally and also
            advertised it as a directory.)

         RESV: Additional reserved flag bits that MUST be sent as zero
            and ignored on receipt.

   o  Confidence: This 8-bit unsigned quantity in the range 0 to 254
      indicates the confidence level in the addresses being transported
      (see Section 4.8.2 of [RFC6325]). A value of 255 is treated as if
      it was 254.

   o  Template: The initial byte of this field is the unsigned integer
      K. If K has a value from 1 to 31, it indicates that this initial
      byte is followed by a list of K AFNs (Address Family Numbers) that
      specify the exact structure and order of each Address Set
      occurring later in the APPsub-TLV. K can be 1, which is the
      minimum valid value. If K is zero, the IA APPsub-TLV is ignored.
      If K is 32 to 254, the length of the Template field is one byte
      and its value is intended to correspond to a particular ordered
      set of AFNs some of which are specified below. The value of 255
      for K is reserved for future definition and causes the IA APPsub-
      TLV to be ignored.

      If the Template uses explicit AFNs, it looks like the following,
      with the number of AFNs, up to 31, equal to K.

         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      For K in the 32 to 39 range, values indicate a specific sequence
      as specified below. The values of K from 40 to 254 are reserved
      for future such specification. If the value of K is not understood
      by a receiver of the IA-APPsub-TLV, any Address Sets present are
      ignored.

          K   Addresses in order of occurrence
         ---  --------------------------------
          32  48-bit MAC
          33  48-bit MAC, IPv4
          34  48-bit MAC, IPv6
          35  48-bit MAC, IPv4, IPv6
          36  48-bit MAC, RBridge port
          37  48-bit MAC, IPv4, RBridge port
          38  48-bit MAC, IPv6, RBridge port
          39  48-bit MAC, IPv4, IPv6, RBridge port

      For ease of decoding, note that for values of K between 32 and 39
      inclusive, the 0x01 bit indicates an IPv4 address is present, the
      0x02 bit indicates an IPv6 address is present, and the 0x04 bit
      indicates that an RBridge port ID is present.

   o  AFN: A two-byte Address Family Number. The number of AFNs present
      is given by K except that there are no AFNs if K is greater than
      31. The AFN sequence specifies the structure of the Address Sets
      occurring later in the TLV. For example, if Template Size is 2 and
      the two AFNs present are the AFNs for a 48-bit MAC and an IPv4
      address, in that order, then each Address set present will consist
      of a 6-byte MAC address followed by a 4-byte IPv4 address. If any
      AFNs are present that are unknown to the receiving IS and the
      length of the corresponding address is not provided by a sub-sub-
      TLV as specified below, the receiving IS will be unable to parse
      the Address Sets and MUST ignore the IA APPsub-TLV.

   o  Address Set: Each address set in the APPsub-TLV consists of
      exactly the same sequence of addresses and types as specified by
      the Template earlier in the APPsub-TLV. No alignment, other than
      to a byte boundary, is provided. The addresses in each Address Set

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      TRILL: IA APPsub-TLV


      are contiguous with no unused bytes between them and the Address
      Sets are contiguous with no unused bytes between successive
      Address Sets. The Address Sets must fit within the TLV.

   o  sub-sub-TLVs: If the Address Sets indicated by Addr Sets End do
      not completely fill the Length of the APPsub-TLV, the remaining
      bytes are parsed as sub-sub-TLVs [RFC5305]. Any such sub-sub-TLVs
      that are not known to the receiving TRILL switch are ignored.
      Should this parsing not be possible, for example there is only one
      remaining byte or an apparent sub-sub-TLV extends beyond the end
      of the TLV, the containing IA APPsub-TLV is considered corrupt and
      is ignored. (Several sub-sub-TLV types are specified in Section
      3.)

   Different IA APPsub-TLVs within the same or different LSPs or other
   data structures may have different Templates. The same AFN may occur
   more than once in a Template and the same address may occur in
   different address sets. For example, a 48-bit MAC address interface
   might have three different IPv6 addresses. This could be represented
   by an IA APPsub-TLV whose Template specifically provided for one
   EUI-48 address and three IPv6 addresses, which might be an efficient
   format if there were multiple interfaces with that pattern.
   Alternatively, a Template with one 48-bit MAC and one IPv6 address
   could be used in an IA APPsub-TLV with three address sets each having
   the same MAC address but different IPv6 addresses, which might be the
   most efficient format if only one interface had multiple IPv6
   addresses and other interfaces had only one IPv6 address.

   In order to be able to parse the Address Sets, a receiving TRILL
   switch must know at least the size of the address for each AFN or
   address type the Template specifies; however, the presence of the
   Addr Set End field means that the sub-sub-TLVs, if any, can always be
   located by a receiver.  A TRILL switch can be assumed to know the
   size of the AFNs mentioned in Section 5. Should a TRILL switch wish
   to include an AFN that some receiving TRILL switch in the campus may
   not know, it SHOULD include an AFN-Size sub-sub-TLV as described in
   Section 3.1. If an IA APPsub-TLV is received with one or more AFNs in
   its template for which the receiving TRILL switch does not know the
   length and for which an AFN-Size sub-sub-TLV is not present, that IA
   APPsub-TLV MUST be ignored.

3. IA APPsub-TLV sub-sub-TLVs

   IA APPsub-TLVs can have trailing sub-sub-TLVs [RFC5305] as specified
   below.  These sub-sub-TLVs occur after the Address Sets and the
   amount of space available for sub-sub-TLVs is determined from the
   overall IA APPsub-TLV length and the value of the Addr Set End byte.

   There is no ordering restriction on sub-sub-TLVs. Unless otherwise
   specified each sub-sub-TLV type can occur zero, one, or many times in
   an IA APPsub-TLV. Any sub-sub-TLVs for which the Type is unknown are
   ignored.

   The sub-sub-TLVs data structures shown below, with two byte Types and
   Lengths, assume that the enclosing IA-APPsubTLV is in an extended LSP
   TLV [RFC7356] or some non-LSP context. If they were used in a IA-
   APPsubTLV in a non-extended LSP [ISO-10589], then only one byte Types
   and Lengths could be used. As a result, any sub-sub-TLV types greater
   than 255 could not be used and Length would be limited to 255.



3.1 AFN Size sub-sub-TLV

   Using this sub-sub-TLV, the originating TRILL switch can specify the
   size of an address type. This is useful under two circumstances as
   follows:

   1. One or more AFNs that are unknown to the receiving TRILL switch
      appears in the template. If an AFN Size sub-sub-TLV is present for
      each such AFN, then at least the IA APPsub-TLV can be parsed and
      possibly other addresses in each address set can still be used.

   2. If an AFN occurs in the Template that represents a variable length
      address, this sub-sub-TLV gives its size for all occurrences in
      that IA APPsub-TLV.

      size of an address type identified by an AFN,

   o  AFN: The AFN whose length is being specified by the AFN Size
      Record.

   o  AdrSize: The length in bytes of addresses specified by the AFN
      field as an unsigned integer.

   An AFN Size sub-sub-TLV for any AFN known to the receiving TRILL
   switch is compared with the size known to the TRILL switch. If they
   differ the IA APPsub-TLV is assumed to be corrupt and MUST be
   ignored.



3.2 Fixed Address sub-sub-TLV

   There may be cases where, in a particular Interface Addresses APP-
   subTLV, the same address would appear in every address set across the
   APP-subTLV.  To avoid wasted space, this sub-sub-TLV can be used to
   indicate such a fixed address. The address or addresses incorporated
   into the sets by this sub-sub-TLV are NOT mentioned in the IA APPsub-
   TLV Template.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Length: variable, minimum 2. If Length is 0 or 1 or less, the sub-
      sub-TLV MUST be ignored.

   o  AFN: Address Family Number of the Fixed Address.

   o  Fixed Address: The address of the type indicated by the preceding
      AFN field that is considered to be part of every Address Set in
      the IA APPsub-TLV.

   The Length field implies a size for the Fixed Address. If that size
   differs from the size of the address type for the given AFN as known
   by the receiving TRILL switch, the Fixed Address sub-sub-TLV is
   considered corrupt and MUST be ignored.



3.3 Data Label sub-sub-TLV

   This sub-sub-TLV indicates the Data Label within which the interfaces
   listed in the IA APPsub-TLV are reachable. It is useful if the IA
   APPsub-TLV occurs outside of the context of a message specifying the
   Data Label or if it is desired and permitted to override that
   specification.  Multiple occurrences of this sub-sub-TLV indicate
   that the interfaces are reachable in all of the Data Labels given.

      o  Type: Data Label sub-TLV type, set to 3 (LABEL).

      o  Length: 2 or 3. If Length is some other value, the sub-sub-TLV
         MUST be ignored.

      o  Data Label: If length is 2, the bottom 12 bits of the Data
         Label are a VLAN ID and the top 4 bits are reserved (MUST be
         sent as zero and ignored on receipt). If the length is 3, the
         three Data Label bytes contain an FGL [RFC7172].



3.4 Topology sub-sub-TLV

   The presence of this sub-sub-TLV indicates that the interfaces given
   in the IA APPsub-TLV are reachable in the topology given. It is
   useful if the IA APPsub-TLV occurs outside of the context of a

4. Security Considerations

   The integrity of address mapping and reachability information and the
   correctness of Data Labels (VLANs or FGLs [RFC7172]) are very
   important.  Forged, altered, or incorrect address mapping or Data
   Labeling can lead to delivery of packets to the incorrect party,
   violating security policy. However, this document merely describes a
   data format and does not provide any explicit mechanisms for securing
   that information, other than a few simple consistency checks that
   might detect some corrupted data. Security on the wire, or in
   storage, for this data is to be providing by the transport or storage
   used. For example, when transported with ESADI [RFC7357] or RBridge
   Channel [RFC7178], ESADI security or Channel Tunnel [ChannelTunnel]
   security mechanisms can be used, respectively.

   The address mapping and reachability information, if known to be
   complete and correct, can be used to detect some cases of forged
   packet source addresses [RFC7067]. In particular, if native traffic
   from an end station is received by a TRILL switch that would
   otherwise accept it but authoritative data indicates the source
   address should not be reachable from the receiving TRILL switch, that
   traffic should be discarded. The data format specified in this
   document may optionally include TRILL switch Port ID number so that
   this forged address filtering can be optionally applied with port
   granularity.

   See [RFC6325] for general TRILL Security Considerations.

5. IANA Considerations

   The following subsections specify IANA actions.



5.1 AFN Number Allocation

   IANA has allocated the following AFN values that may be useful for IA
   APPsub-TLVs:

              Hex    Decimal   Description      References
             -----   -------   -----------      ----------

              0001        1    IPv4
              0002        2    IPv6
              4005    16389    48-bit MAC       [RFC7042]
              4006    16390    64-bit MAC       [RFC7042]
              4007    16391    OUI              This document.
              4008    16392    MAC/24           This document.
              4009    16393    MAC/40           This document.
              400A    16394    IPv6/64          This document.
              400B    16395    RBridge Port ID  This document.

   Other AFNs can be found at http://www.iana.org/assignments/address-
   family-numbers

   The OUI AFN is provided so that MAC addresses can be abbreviated if
   they have the same upper 24 bits.  A MAC/24 is a 24-bit suffix
   intended to be pre-fixed by an OUI to create a 48-bit MAC address
   [RFC7042]; in the absence of an OUI, a MAC/24 entry cannot be used.
   A MAC/40 is a suffix intended to be pre-fixed by an OUI to create a
   64-bit MAC address [RFC7042]; in the absence of an OUI, a MAC/40
   entry cannot be used.

   Typically, an OUI would be provided as a Fixed Address sub-sub-TLV
   (see Section 3.2) using the OUI AFN.

   After Fixed Address sub-sub-TLV processing, each address set is
   processed by combining each OUI in the address set with each MAC/24
   and each MAC/40 address in the address set. Depending on how many of
   each of these address types is present, zero or more 48-bit and/or
   64-bit MAC addresses may be produced that are considered to be part
   of the address set.  If there are no MAC/24 or MAC/40 addresses
   present, any OUI's are ignored. If there are no OUIs, any MAC/24
   and/or MAC/40s are ignored. If there are K1 OUIs, K2 MAC/24s, and K3
   MAC/40s, K1*K2 48-bit MACs are synthesized and K1*K3 64-bit MACs are
   synthesized.

   IPv6/64 is an 8-byte quantity that is the first 64 bits of an IPv6

   address. IPv6/64s are ignored unless, after the processing above in
   this sub-section, there are one or more 48-bit and/or 64-bit MAC
   addresses in the address set to provide the lower 64 bits of the IPv6
   address. For this purpose, an 48-bit MAC address is expanded to 64
   bits as described in [RFC7042]. If there are K4 IPv6/64s present and
   K5 48- and 64-bit MAC addresses present, K4*K5 128-bit IPv6 addresses
   are synthesized.



5.2 IA APPsub-TLV Sub-Sub-TLVs SubRegistry

   IANA is requested to establish a new subregistry of the TRILL
   Parameter Registry for sub-sub-TLVs of the Interface Addresses
   APPsub-TLV with initial contents as shown below.

      Name:       Interface Addresses APPsub-TLV Sub-Sub-TLVs

5.3 IA APPsub-TLV Number

   IANA is requested to allocate TBD1 as the Type for the IA APPsub-TLV
   in the "TRILL APPsub-TLV Types under IS-IS TLV 251 Application
   Identifier 1" registry from the range under 256. In the registry the
   Name is "IA" and the Reference is this document.

Appendix A: Examples

   Below are example IA APPsub-TLVs. "0x" indicates that the following
   quantity is in hexadecimal. "0b" indicates that the following
   quantity is in binary. Leading zeros are retained.



A.1 Simple Example

   Below is an annotated IA APPsub-TLV carrying two simple pairs of
   EUI-48 MAC addresses and IPv4 addresses from a Push Directory
   [RFC7067]. No sub-sub-TLVs are included.

      0x0002(TBD)   Type: Interface Addresses
      0x001B        Length: 27 (=0x1B)
      0x001B        Address Sets End: 27 (=0x1B)
      0x1234        RBridge Nickname from which reachable
      0b10000000    Flags: Push Directory data
      0xE3          Confidence = 227
      33            Template: 33 (0x21) = 32 + 1(IPv4)

            Address Set One
      0x00005E0053A9   48-bitMAC address
      198.51.100.23    IPv4 address

            Address Set Two
      0x00005E00536B   48-bit MAC address
      203.0.113.201    IPv4 address

   Size includes 7 for the fixed fields though and including the one
   byte template, plus 2 times the Address Set size. Each Address Set is
   10 bytes, 6 for the 48-bit MAC address plus 4 for the IPv4 address.
   So total size is 7 + 2*10 = 27.

   See Section 2 for more information on Template.



A.2 Complex Example

   Below is an annotated IA APPsub-TLV carrying three sets of addresses,
   each consisting of an EUI-48 MAC address, an IPv4 addresses, an IPv6
   address, and an RBridge Port ID, all from a Push Directory [RFC7067].
   The IPv6 address for each address set is synthesized from the MAC
   address given in that set and the IPv6/64 64-bit prefix provided
   through a Fixed Address sub-sub-TLV. In addition, a sub-sub-TLV is
   included that provides an FGL which overrides whatever Data Label may
   be provided by the envelope (for example an ESADI-LSP [RFC7357])
   within which this IA APPsub-TLV occurs.

      192.0.2.139      IPv4 address
      0x01DE           RBridge Port ID

      0x20010DB800000000   IPv6 Prefix: 2001:DB8::

   See Section 2 for more information on Template.

   The Fixed Address sub-sub-TLV causes the IPv6/64 value given to be
   treated as if it occurred as a 4th entry inside each of the three
   Address Sets. When there is an IPv6/64 entry and a 48-bit MAC entry,
   the MAC value is expanded by inserting 0xFFFE immediately after the
   OUI and the resulting 64-bit value is used as the lower 64 bits of
   the resulting IPv6 address [RFC7042]. As a result, a receiving TRILL
   switch would treat the three Address Sets shown as if they had an
   IPv6 address in them as follows:








D. Eastlake and Y Li                                           [Page 19]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      TRILL: IA APPsub-TLV


            Address Set One
      0x20010DB80000000000005EFFFE0053DE  IPv6 Address

            Address Set Two
      0x20010DB80000000000005EFFFE0053E3  IPv6 Address

            Address Set Three
      0x20010DB80000000000005EFFFE0053D3  IPv6 Address

   As an alternative to the compact "well know value" Template encoding
   used in this example above, the less compact explicit AFN encoding
   could have been used. In that case, the IA APPsub-TLV would have
   started as follows:

      0x0002(TBD)   Type: Interface Addresses
      0x003C        Length: 60 (=0x3C)
      0x0027        Address Sets End: 39 (=0x27)
      0x4321        RBridge Nickname from which reachable
      0b10000000    Flags: Push Directory data
      0xD3          Confidence = 211
      0x3           Template: 3 AFNs
      0x4005        AFN: 48-bit MAC
      0x0001        AFN: IPv4
      0x400B        AFN: RBridge Port ID

   As a final point, since the 48-bit MAC addresses in these three
   Address Sets all have the same OUI (the IANA OUI [RFC7042]), it would
   have been possible to just have a MAC/24 value giving the lower 24
   bits of the MAC in each Address Set. The OUI would them be supplied
   by a second Fixed Address sub-sub-TLV proving the OUI. With N Address
   Sets, this would have saved 3*N or 9 bytes in this case at the cost
   of 9 bytes (2 each for the type and length of the sub-sub-TLV, 2 for
   the OUI AFN number, and 3 for the OUI). So, with just three Address
   Sets, there would be no net saving; however, with a larger number of
   Address Sets, there would be a net savings.
