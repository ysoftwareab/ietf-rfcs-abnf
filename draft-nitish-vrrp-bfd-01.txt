      Fast failure detection using peer learning in VRRP with BFD
                        draft-nitish-vrrp-bfd-01

Abstract

   This draft presents an enhanced failure detection mechanism to detect
   the failure of VRRP Master router on the LAN using a peer learning
   mode.  Typically the VRRP protocol is able to perform the transparent
   fail-over detection within a time period of 3 seconds with default
   fail-over timers.  Real-time protocols (voice/video/real-time
   transactional) require a maximum network disruption in the order of
   150ms for traffic on the network.  A failure detection and fail-over
   time of 150ms on conventionally configured VRRP protocol is extremely
   aggressive and may impact the reliability and performance of the
   network.

   A more efficient mechanism for real-time failure detection can be
   enabled in VRRP protocol by building a peer table, using a new VRRP
   Advert packet type.  This will help in forming a mesh of BFD
   sessions.  Once the BFD sessions are created, VRRP can receive faster
   notification of failures, without the overhead of increased VRRP
   protocol Advert messages.

1.  Introduction

   Fast failure detection in the network is becoming increasingly
   important.  VRRP helps in providing redundant Virtual gateways in the
   LAN, which is typically the first point of failure for end-hosts
   sending traffic out of the LAN.  A faster failure detection of VRRP
   master becomes very critical as it can isolate all end-hosts that are
   unable to detect any alternate path.  In VRRP [RFC5798] protocol
   specification, Backup routers depends on Advert packets generated at
   a regular interval by the Master router, to detect the health of the
   VRRP Master.  Faster failure detection can be achieved within VRRP
   protocol by reducing the Advert and hold down timers.  But Aggressive
   timers can put extra load on the network bandwidth which may not be
   desirable.

   As the VRRP protocol depends on the availability of L3 IPv4 or IPv6
   between redundant peers, VRRP protocol can interact with the L3
   variant of BFD as described in [RFC5881], to achieve a much faster
   failure detection of the VRRP Master in the LAN.  BFD as specified by
   the RFC [RFC5880] can provide a much faster failure detection in the
   range of 150ms.

   BFD IPv4 or IPv6 [RFC5881] requires that for a BFD session to be
   formed, both peers participating in a BFD session need to know to its
   peer IPv4 or IPV6 address.  This poses a unique problem with the
   definition of the VRRP [RFC5798] protocol, that makes the operation
   with BFD IPv4 or IPv6 [RFC5881] more challenging.  As in VRRP it is
   only the Master peer that sends Advert packets.  This means that a
   Master peer is not aware of any Backup peers, and Backup peers are
   only aware of the Master peer.  This also means that Backup peers are
   not aware of other Backups in the Network.

   Since BFD IPv4 or IPv6 [RFC5881] requires that a session be formed by
   both peers using a full destination and source address, there needs
   to be some external means to provide this information to BFD on
   behalf of VRRP.  Once the peer information is made available, VRRP
   can form BFD sessions with each of the peers that exist in the
   Virtual Router.  The most important BFD session for a given Virtual
   Router is identified as the Critical Path BFD Session, which is the
   session that forms between the current VRRP Master, and the highest
   priority Backup.  Should the Critical Path BFD Session be identified
   by the VRRP as having changed state from UP to DOWN, then this will
   be interpreted by the VRRP state machine on the highest priority
   Backup peer as a Master Down event.  A Master Down event means that
   the highest priority Backup peer will immediately become the new
   Master for the Virtual Router.

   NOTE: At all times, the normal fail-over mechanism defined in the

   VRRP [RFC5798] will be unaffected, and the BFD fail-over mechanism
   will always resort to normal VRRP fail-over.

   This draft defines the mechanism used by VRRP protocol to Build a
   peer table that will help in forming a mesh of BFD sessions and the
   detection of Critical Path BFD session.  If the Critical Path BFD
   session were to go down it will signal a Master down event and make
   the most preferred Backup router as the VRRP Master.  This requires
   an extension to the VRRP protocol.

   This can be achieved by defining a new type in the VRRP Advert
   packet, and allowing VRRP peers to build a peer table in any of the
   operational state, Master or Backup.

3.  Extension to VRRP protocol

   In this mode of operation VRRP peers learn the adjacent peers, and
   form BFD sessions between the learnt peers.  In order to build the
   peer table, all peers send VRRP Advert packets whilst in any of the
   operational states (Master or Backup).  Normally VRRP [RFC5798] peers
   only send Advert packets whilst in the Master state, however in this
   mode VRRP Backup peers will also send Advert packets with the type
   field set to BACKUP ADVERTISEMENT type defined in Section 3.2.  VRRP
   Master peer will still continue to send packets with Advert type as
   ADVERTISEMENT as defined in the VRRP [RFC5798] protocol.  This is to
   maintain inter-operability with peers complying to VRRP [RFC5798]
   protocol.

   Additionally Advert packets sent from Backup Peers must not use the
   Virtual router MAC address as the source address.  Instead it must
   use the Interface MAC address as the source address from which the
   packet is sent from.  This is because the source MAC override feature
   is used by the Master to send Advert packets from the Virtual Router
   MAC address, which is used to keep the bridging cache on LAN switches
   and bridging devices refreshed with the destination port for the
   Virtual Router MAC.

3.1.  VRRP Peer Table

   VRRP peers can now form the peer table by learning the source address
   in the ADVERTISEMENT or BACKUP ADVERTISEMENT packet sent by VRRP
   Master or Backup peers.  This allows all peers to create a mesh of
   BFD sessions with all other operational peers.

   A peer entry should be removed from the peer table if Advert is not
   received from a peer for a period of (3 * the Advert interval).

   The type field specifies the type of this VRRP packet.  The type
   field can have two values.  Type 1 (ADVERTISEMENT) is used by the
   VRRP Master Router.  Type 2 (BACKUP ADVERTISEMENT) is used by the
   VRRP Backup router.  This is to distinguish the packets sent by the
   VRRP backup Router.  Rest of the fields in Advert packet remain the
   same.

      1 ADVERTISEMENT
      2 BACKUP ADVERTISEMENT

   A packet with unknown type MUST be discarded.

                       BR    =  Backup Router
                       PR    =  VRRP Router priority
                       VRID  =  VRRP Router ID
                       VRIPVX=  IPv4 or IPv6 address protected by

                                the Virtual Router


   In the above configuration there are three routers on the LAN
   protecting an IPv4 or IPv6 address associated to a Virtual Router ID
   1.  The Rtr1 is the master router as it has the highest priority
   compared the Rtr2 and Rtr3.  Now if peer learning extension is
   enabled on all the peers.  Rtr1 will send the Advert packet with type
   field set to 1.  While Rtr2 and Rtr3 will send the Advert packet with
   type field set to 2.  In the above configuration the peer table built
   at each router is shown below:

   Once the peer tables are formed, VRRP on each router can form a mesh
   of BFD sessions with all the learnt peers.

5.  Critical BFD session

   Critical BFD Session is determined to be the session between the VRRP
   Master and the next best VRRP Backup.  Failure of the Critical BFD
   session indicates that the Master is no longer available and the most
   preferred Backup will now become Master.

   In the above example the Critical BFD session is shared between Rtr1
   and Rtr2.  If the BFD Session goes from UP to DOWN state, Rtr2 can
   treat it as a Master down event and immediately assume the role of
   VRRP Master router for VRID 1 and Rtr3 will become the critical
   backup.

6.  Scalability Considerations

   When forming mesh of BFD sessions one possible scenario can occur if
   the system is not able to scale well with the increased load of
   multiple BFD sessions.  To mitigate this problem sharing of BFD
   sessions with other protocols and opening less number of BFD sessions
   should be considered, i.e between Master and the most preferred
   Backup router part of the VRRP instance.

   To reduce the number of packets generated at a regular interval,
   Backup Advert packets may be sent at a reduced rate as compared to
   Advert packets sent by the VRRP Master.

7.  Operational Considerations

   A VRRP [RFC5798] peer that forms a member of this Virtual Router, but
   does not support this feature or extension must be configured with
   the lowest priority, and will only operate as the Router of last
   resort on failure of all other VRRP routers supporting this
   functionality.

   It is recommended that mechanism defined by this draft, to interface
   VRRP with BFD should be used when BFD can support more aggressive
   monitoring timers than VRRP.  Otherwise it is desirable not to
   interface VRRP with BFD for determining the health of VRRP Master.

   This Draft does not preclude the possibility of the peer table being
   populated by means of manual configuration, instead of using the
   BACKUP ADVERTISEMENT as defined by the Draft.
