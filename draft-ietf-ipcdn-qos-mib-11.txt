IPCDN DOCSIS QoS MIB                            January 2005



1.  Introduction

   This memo is a product of the IP over Cable Data Network (IPCDN)
   working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
   Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's
   mailing list at ipcdn@ietf.org and/or the authors.


1.1  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [1], STD 58, RFC 2579 [2] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [3].

1.2  Glossary



   Active QPS     Active QoS Parameter Set (QPS). The set of QoS
                  parameters that describe the current level service
                  provided to a Service Flow (SF).

   Active SF      Active Service Flow. An SF with a non-empty Active
                  QPS.

   Admitted QPS   Admitted QoS Parameter Set. The set of QoS parameters
                  that describe a level of service which the Service
                  Flow is not currently using, but which it is
                  guaranteed to receive upon the SF's request to make
                  the set Active.

   Admitted SF    A Service Flow with a non-empty Admitted QPS.

   CATV           Cable TV

   CM             Cable Modem, a modem connecting a subscriber's LAN the
                  CATV RF network. DOCSIS CMs operate as a MAC layer
                  bridge between the home LAN and the RF network.

   CMTS           Cable Modem Termination System, the "head-end" device
                  providing connectivity between the RF network and the
                  Internet.

   Downstream     The direction from the head-end towards the
                  subscriber.

   DSA            Dynamic Service Addition, a DOCSIS MAC management
                  message requesting the dynamic creation of a new
                  Service Flow. New SFs are created with a three-message
                  exchange of a DSA-REQ, DSA-RSP, and DSA-ACK.

   DSC            Dynamic Service Change, a DOCSIS MAC management
                  message requesting a change to the attributes of a
                  Service Flow.  SFs are changed with a three-message
                  exchange of a DSC-REQ, DSC-RSP, and DSC-ACK.

   DSD            Dynamic Service Delete, a DOCSIS MAC management
                  message requesting the deletion of a Service Flow. SFs
                  are deleted with a two-message exchange of a DSD-REQ
                  and DSD-ACK.

   Head-end       The origination point in most cable systems of the
                  subsriber video signals. It is generally also the
                  location of the CMTS.

   PHS            Payload Header Suppression, a feature of DOCSIS 1.1
                  and 2.0 in which header bytes that are common in a
                  sequence of packets of a Service Flow are replaced by
                  a one-byte PHSI Index (PHSI) when transmitting the
                  packet on the RF network.

   Provisioned QPS A QoS Parameter Set describing an envelope of service
                  within which a Service Flow is authorized to request
                  admission.  All existing Service Flows must have a
                  non-empty Provisioned QPS, hence all SFs are
                  considered to be "Provisioned".

   SCN            Service Class Name -- a named set of QoS parameters.
                  A Service Flow may or may not be associated with a
                  single named Service Class.  A Service Class has as an
                  attribute a QoS Parameter Set that is used as the
                  default set of values for all Service Flows belonging
                  to the Service Class.

   SID            Service ID. A 16-bit integer assigned by the CMTS for
                  an Upstream Service Flow with a non-empty Active QoS
                  Parameter Set.

   SF             Service Flow. A unidirectional stream of packets
                  between the CM and CMTS. SFs are characterized as
                  upstream or downstream.  The SF is the fundamental
                  unit of service provided on a DOCSIS CATV network.

   SFID           Service Flow ID.  A 32-bit unsigned integer assigned
                  by the CMTS to each Service Flows

   Upstream       The direction from a subscriber CM to the head-end
                  CMTS.




2.  Overview

   This MIB module provides a set of objects required for the management
   of DOCSIS 1.1 and 2.0 compliant Cable Modems (CM) and Cable Modem
   Termination Systems (CMTS). The specification is derived from the
   DOCSIS 2.0 Radio Frequency Interface specification [4]. Please note
   that the referenced DOCSIS specifications only requires Cable Modems
   to process IPv4 customer traffic. Design choices in this MIB module
   reflect those requirements. Future versions of the DOCSIS standard
   are expected to require support for IPv6 as well.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [5].


2.1  Textual Conventions

   The textual convention "DocsIetfQosRfMacIfDirection" is defined to
   indicate the direction of a packet classifier relative to an
   interface. It takes the values of either downstream(1) or
   upstream(2).

   The textual convention "DocsIetfQosBitRate" corresponds to the bits
   per second as defined for QoS Parameter Sets in DOCSIS 1.1 and 2.0.
   This definition includes all bits of the Ethernet MAC frame as
   transmitted on the RF network, starting with the Destination Address
   and ending with the Ethernet Frame Check Sequence (FCS). It does NOT
   includes bits in the DOCSIS MAC header.





2.2  MIB Organization


   The structure of the IPCDN QoS MIB module (DOCS-IETF-QOS-MIB) is
   summarized below:

   The docsIetfQosPktClassTable reports the Service Flow Classifiers
   implemented by the managed device. The table is indexed by the tuple
   { ifIndex, docsIetfQosServiceFlowId, docsIetfQosPktClassId }. The
   ifIndex corresponds to an CATV MAC interface. Each CATV MAC interface
   has a set of Service Flows, identified with a
   docsIetfQosServiceFlowId value that is unique for that interface.
   Each Service Flow may have a number of packet classifiers that map
   packets to the flow. The ClassifierId for the classifier is unique
   only within a particular Service Flow.

   The semantics of packet classification are provided in [4]. Briefly,
   the DOCSIS MAC interface calls for matching packets based on values
   within the 802.2 (LLC), 802.3, IP, and/or  UDP/TCP headers.  Packets
   which map more than one classifier are prioritized according to their
   docsIetfQosPktClassPriority value. The docsIetfQosServiceFlowId (an
   index object) indicates to which Service Flow the packet is
   classified.

   The docsIetfQosPktClassTable is distinct from the
   docsDevIpFilterTable of [6] in that docsIetfQosPktClassTable is
   intended only to reflect the state of the Service Flow Classifiers.
   Service Flow Classifiers may be created only via a CM configuration
   file or from the Dynamic Service Addition (DSA) messages.  For this
   reason, docsIetfQosPktClassTable is read-only.

   The docsDevIpFilterTable is intended for external policy-based
   administration of packet classifiers.  See the section "Externally
   Administered Classification", below.

2.2.2  docsIetfQosParamSetTable

   The docsIetfQosParamSetTable reports the values of Qos Parameter Set
   as defined in Section C.2.2 of [4].

   In general, a Service Flow is associated with three different QoS
   Parameter Sets (QPSs): an "active" QPS, an "admitted" QPS, and a
   "provisioned" or "authorized" QPS.  The relationship of these three
   sets is represented below:





                         +---------------------+
                         | Provisioned         |
                         |                     |

                         |  |  Admitted     |  |

                         |  |  +---------+  |  |

                         +---------------------+

                       Figure 1: QoS Parameter Sets



   The Provisioned QPS describes the maximum service envelope for which
   the SF is authorized. The Admitted QPS is the set of services for
   which a Service Flow has requested admission to the DOCSIS RF
   network, but which is not yet active. The Admitted QPS is used during
   the two-phase process of IP Telephony/PacketCable Service Flow
   admission to admit the bandwidth for a bidirectional voice call when
   the far end is ringing.  Since ringing may occur for up to four
   minutes, this permits the bandwidth to be reserved but not actually
   consumed during this interval.  The Active QPS is the set of services
   actually being used by the Service Flow. The DOCSIS v1.1
   specification [4] defines what it means for a QPS envelope to be
   "within" another.  In general, an inner QPS is considered to be
   "within" an outer QPS when all QoS parameters represent demands of
   equal or fewer resources of the network.

   In addition to their use as attributes of a Service Flow, a QPS is
   also an attribute of a Service Class.  A DOCSIS CM configuration file
   or DSA message may request the creation of a new SF and give only the

   Service Class Name. The CMTS "expands the macro" of a Service Class
   Name creation by populating the Provisioned, Admitted, and/or Active
   QPSs of the Service Flow with the QPS of the Service Class Name. All
   of the QPSs of a Service Flow must be expansions of the same Service
   Class, and in this case the SF is said to "belong" to the Service
   Class. Changing the contents of a Service Class' QPS does not affect
   the QPS of any Service Flow earlier expanded from that Service Class
   name. Only the CMTS implements docsIetfQosServiceClassTable.

   See [4] section 8 for a full description and the theory of operation
   of DOCSIS 1.1 QoS operation.

   The docsIetfQosParamSetTable sets are indexed by { ifIndex,
   docsIetfQosServiceFlowId, docsIetfQosParamSetType}. ifIndex indicates
   a particular "DOCSIS MAC Domain". docsIetfQosServiceFlowId uniquely
   identifies a Service Flow on that MAC domain. The
   docsIetfQosParamSetType indicates whether the row describes an
   active, admitted, or provisioned QoS Parameter Set.

   The docsIetfQosParamSetTable is read-only, because it indicates the
   QoS Parameter Set contents as defined by DOCSIS signaling. The
   docsIetfQosServiceClassTable is read-create to permit managers to
   define a template of Qos Parameters that can be referenced by DOCSIS
   modems when creating their QoS Parameter Sets.


2.2.2.1  Interoperation with DOCSIS 1.0

   The DOCS-IF-MIB [7] specifies a docsIfQosProfileTable to describe the
   set of Class Of Service (COS) parameters associated with a COS
   "profile". The docsIfCmServiceTable, which contains one entry per
   SID, references this table with a  docsIfCmServiceQosProfile number.

   The DOCSIS 1.1 and 2.0 CM registration process allows a modem to
   register as operating either with DOCSIS 1.0, DOCSIS 1.1, or DOCSIS
   2.0 functionality. For ease of expression, we call a modem
   registering with DOCSIS 1.0 functionality a "DOCSIS 1.0 modem",
   regardless of the modem's capabilities.

   A CMTS or CM supporting both DOCSIS 1.0, DOCSIS 1.1, and DOCSIS 2.0
   implements both the tables of [7] and the tables of this MIB module.
   The interoperation goal is that before modem registration, the DOCSIS
   1.0 MIB [7] applies. After registration, either the DOCSIS 1.0 or
   DOCSIS 1.1/2.0 MIB applies, depending on the mode with which the
   modem registered. The specific interoperation rules are:


     1.  When a CM initially ranges, the CM implements a row in the
         DOCS-IF-MIB docsIfCmServiceTable and the CMTS implements a row
         in the DOCS-IF-MIB docsIfCmtsServiceTable corresponding to the
         default upstream Service ID (SID) used for pre-registration

         upstream traffic. For historical compatibility a row may be
         created for the docsIfQosProfileTable with default values,
         which may be referenced by the docsIfCmServiceTable entries.


     2.  Both a CMTS and CM implementing this MIB MUST NOT implement
         docsIetfQosParamSetTable or docsIetfQosServiceFlowTable rows
         until after the CM registers with DOCSIS 1.1 or 2.0 modem
         operation.


     3.  When a modem registers with the CMTS as a "DOCSIS 1.1" or
         "DOCSIS 2.0" modem, any exclusively-referenced row in DOCS-IF-
         MIB docsIfQosProfileTable representing the modems upstream QoS
         profile for pre-registration traffic MUST be removed.
         Multiply-referenced rows may remain. The
         docsIfCmServiceQosProfile object in the CM's row of
         docsIfCmServiceTable MUST be set to zero. The
         docsIfCmServiceTable row for the DOCSIS 1.1 or DOCSIS 2.0 modem
         continues to exist, and the various statistic objects in that
         row are incremented. The CMTS should retain a
         docsIfCmtsServiceTable entry for the DOCSIS 1.1 or DOCSIS 2.0
         CM.


     4.  When a DOCSIS 1.1 or DOCSIS 2.0 modem registers, both the CMTS
         and CM represent all Service Flows described in the modem
         configuration file in docsIetfQosParamSetTable and
         docsIetfQosServiceFlowTable.


     5.  DOCSIS 1.0 modems do not have entries in the DOCS-IETF-QOS-MIB.



2.2.3  docsIetfQosServiceFlowTable

   The docsIetfQosServiceFlowTable provides read-only information about
   all of the Service Flows known by the device. It is indexed by the
   combination of { ifIndex, dosQosServiceFlowId }, where ifIndex
   corresponds to a CATV MAC interface and docsIetfQosServiceFlowId is
   the 32- bit integer assigned by the CMTS controlling the MAC domain.
   A CM typically has only a single CATV MAC interface, while a CMTS may
   have several. See [7] for a description of the ifIndex numbering for
   DOCSIS devices.

   The table indicates whether a given SF is in the upstream or
   downstream direction, and whether it is the "primary" SF in that
   direction.  The primary SF carries traffic that is not otherwise
   classified to any other SF in that direction.

2.2.4  docsIetfQosServiceFlowStatsTable

   The docsIetfQosServiceFlowStatsTable provides statistics for all
   currently existing SFs known by the managed device.  It provides
   basic packet and octet counters, as well as certain other SF-specific
   stats such as the time at which the flow was created and how many
   seconds it has been active.

   The table also provides objects which can be used to fine-tune
   admission control decisions, namely the number of packets dropped or
   delayed due to QoS policing decisions enforced by the managed device.

   The model of the Service Flows stats table is that there exists a
   Service Flow Classification function followed by a Service Flow
   maximum rate Policing function for packets transmitted onto the
   DOCSIS RF network, as depicted below


                                              +----------+

                                                +----+  Delayed

   Packets intended for transmission onto the DOCSIS RF network
   (upstream or downstream) are first classified to a Service Flow by
   matching one of several possible classifiers associated with that
   Service Flow.  The docsIetfQosPktClassPkts count includes the number
   of packets that match the classifier, regardless of the eventual
   disposition of the packet.

   DOCSIS requires that each Service Flow be policed to maintain a
   maximum rate of transmission. This is performed by either dropping or
   delaying a packet on that Service Flow.  The
   docsIetfQosServiceFlowPolicedDropPkts object counts the number of
   Service Flow packets dropped by the policing function.  The
   docsIetfQosServiceFlowPolicedDelayPkts counts the number of packet
   delayed but still forwarded.  The docsIetfQosServiceFlowPkts object
   counts the total number of packets forwarded beyond the policing
   function intended for eventual transmission onto the DOCSIS RF
   network. Although packets may be latter dropped by other functions
   (e.g. a transmit queue overflow on a DOCSIS hardware transmitter),
   the docsIetfQos MIB per service-flow counters are not affected in
   this case.

2.2.5  docsIetfQosUpstreamStatsTable

   This table provides statistics that are measured only at the CMTS in
   the upstream direction. These include a count of the number of
   fragmentation headers received, fragments discarded, and the number
   of concatenation headers received.


2.2.6  docsIetfQosDynamicServiceStatsTable

   This table provides read-only stats on the operation of the Dynamic
   Service state machines as specified in section 9.4 of [4]. It
   provides a set of 14 counters *in each direction* for a DOCSIS MAC
   layer interface. That is, each DOCSIS MAC layer interface has one row
   for downstream stats, and a second row for upstream stats.

   Eight of the counters are DSx packet type counts, one counter for
   each of the eight DSx packet types. For example, the
   docsIetfQosDSAReqs object in the upstream row at the CMTS counts the
   number of DSA-REQ messages received by the CMTS from that interface.
   The docsIetfQosDSAReqs object in the downstream row at the CMTS
   counts the number of DSA-REQ messages transmitted by the CMTS on that
   interface.

   The remaining six counters per (interface, direction) combination
   count the number of successful and unsuccessful *transactions* that
   were initiated on the interface and direction. For example, the
   upstream docsIetfQosDynamicAdds on a CMTS is the number of
   successfully completed CM-initiated dynamic additions, because at the
   CMTS a CM-initiated DSA starts in the upstream direction.  The
   downstream docsIetfQosDynamicAdds at a CMTS is the number of
   successful CMTS-initiated DSA transactions.

   Dynamic service transactions can fail for a number of reasons, as
   listed in the state machines of section 9.4. Rather than include
   still more counters for each different failure reason, they are
   grouped into a single count, e.g docsIetfQosDynamicAddFails.  Again,
   this object exists in both directions, so that locally originated vs
   remotely originated transaction failures are counted separately.
   Further troubleshooting of transaction failures will require
   vendor-specific queries and operation.


2.2.7  docsIetfQosServiceFlowLogTable

   This table contains a log of the Service Flows no longer existing in
   the docsIetfQosServiceFlowTable. It is intended to be periodically
   polled by traffic monitoring and billing agents. It is implemented
   only at the CMTS.

   It contains a chronological log of SF session statistics, including a

   total count of packets and octets transferred on the SF.  It includes
   time stamps of the SF creation and deletion time, as well as its
   number of active seconds. The active second count is the count of
   seconds that the SF had a non-empty Active QoS Parameter Set, i.e. it
   was eligible to pass data.  For unicast SFs, it includes the CM MAC
   address associated with the flow for billing reference purposes.

   The maximum number of log records kept by a CMTS, and the duration
   that a log record is maintained in the table is vendor-specific.  An
   explicit control object is provided so that the monitoring
   application can explicitly delete records it has read.


2.2.8  docsIetfQosServiceClassTable

   This table defines the Service Class Name and references a QoS
   Parameter Set for each Service Class defined in a CMTS.  It is
   indexed by the Service Class Name string itself. The table is
   read-create on a CMTS, and is not implemented in a CM.  Each entry of
   the docsIetfQosServiceClassTable should define a template for flows
   in a given direction (upstream or downstream). Some parameters of the
   docsIetfQosServiceClassTable are specific to a particular direction,
   and so their values are not-applicable when used as a template for
   flows in the other direction.



2.2.9  docsIetfQosServiceClassPolicyTable


   The docsIetfQosServiceClassPolicyTable can be referenced by the
   docsDevFilterPolicyTable of [6] in order to have a "policy" that
   classifies packets to a named Service Class. This is one mechanism by
   which "external" entities (like an SNMP manager) may control the
   classification of packet for QoS purposes. Entries are indexed by a
   small integer docsIetfQosServiceClassPolicyIndex.  They provide a
   Service Class Name and a Rule Priority.  A policy referencing a row
   of this table intends the packet to be forwarded on a Service Flow
   "belonging" to the named Service Class. See the section "Externally
   Administered Classification", below.

   This table is implemented on both the CM and CMTS, and is read-create
   on both.


2.2.10  docsIetfQosPHSTable

   The Payload Header Suppression (PHS) feature of DOCSIS 1.1 and 2.0
   permits packets to replace the unchanging bytes of the Ethernet, IP,
   and UDP headers with a one-byte index when transmitting on the cable
   network.  This is especially useful for IP Telephony packets, where

IPCDN DOCSIS QoS MIB                            January 2005



   such suppression can result in almost twice the number of calls
   supported within the same upstream channel.

   Each entry of the table corresponds to a PHS Rule as described in
   section 8.4 of [4].  The rules are identified by their corresponding
   Service Flow ID and docsIetfQosPktClassId. A PHS rule is associated
   with exactly one classifier.  The table is therefore indexed by the
   tuple { ifIndex, docsIetfQosServiceFlowId, docsIetfQosPktClassId}.

   This table is read-only, and MUST be implemented on both the CM and
   CMTS when PHS is supported.


2.2.11  docsIetfQosCmtsMacToSrvFlowTable

   The docsIetfQosCmtsMacToSrvFlowTable provides describes the mapping
   of CM mac addresses to the  Service Flow Ids that are uniquely
   identified with that CM.  External applications may collect
   statistics on all packets flowing through a CM by determining the
   SFID of all of its flows, and then collecting the statistics of
   packets and bytes for each flow.

   Downstream multicast Service Flows are not indicated in the
   docsIetfQosCmtsMacToSrvFlowTable because they are not associated with
   only one CM.




3.  Externally Administered Classification

   DOCSIS 1.1 and 2.0 provide rich semantics for the classification of
   packets to Service Flows with it Service Flow Classifier table.
   Service Flow Classifiers may be created statically in the DOCSIS CM
   configuration file, or may be created dynamically with Dynamic
   Service Addition (DSA) and Dynamic Service Change (DSC) DOCSIS MAC
   messages.

   Several major issues arose with the concept of externally
   administered classification, i.e. should an external SNMP manager be
   permitted to create classification rows? One problem was the
   co-ordination of classifier IDs, since such an approach would require
   either separate classifier ID number spaces or objects to co-ordinate
   both internal and external classifier ID assignments. A more serious
   problem, however, was the requirement that external creation of SF
   Classifiers would require "knowledge" of the individual Service Flow
   ID for Service Flows by external applications.  It was strongly felt
   by the committee that SFIDs should remain an internal DOCSIS object,
   and not be transmitted as part of protocol flows, e.g. for IP packet
   telephony signaling.  DOCSIS 1.1 introduced the concept of named
   Service Classes for ease of administration within a domain of CMs and

   CMTSs.  What was desired was to permit external classification of
   packets to a Service Class, not a particular Service Flow.

   The DOCSIS committee therefore decided to use the already-defined IP
   Packet Filter Table [6] for the external classification of packets
   for QoS purposes.  The docsDevIpPacketFilterTable defines similar
   packet matching criteria as docsIetfQosPktClassTable, but it matches
   a packet to an arbitrary "policy set" instead of a particular Service
   Flow. One of the policies in the policy set then selects the Service
   Class of the SF on which to forward the packet.  The
   docsIetfQosServiceClassPolicyTable of this MIB module defines the
   Service Class Name to which a packet is classified.

   The interaction of external and internal packet classification is
   depicted below.

          Figure 2: DOCSIS Packet Classification


   The processing of an outgoing packet proceeds as follows:

          1.  The packet is first checked for matches with rows of the
              docsDevIpFilterTable. If it matches, the matching row
              provides a docsDevFilterPolicyId integer.

          2.  The docsDevFilterPolicyId indexes into one (or more) rows
              of docsDevFilterPolicyTable. Each row provides an
              arbitrary RowPointer (docsDevFilterPolicyPtr),
              corresponding to a policy to be applied to the packet.

          3.  This MIB module defines a
              docsIetfQosServiceClassPolicyTable whose entries may be

              pointed to by docsDevFilterPolicyPtr in order to
              administratively classify packets to a named DOCSIS
              Service Class.  The docsIetfQosServiceClassPolicyEntry
              provides a Service Class Name (SCN) as
              docsIetfQosServiceClassPolicyName and a classification
              rule priority as
              docsIetfQosServiceClassPolicyRulePriority. These are
              submitted to the device's DOCSIS MAC Layer entity as a
              special form of the MAC_DATA.request primitive, as
              described in Section E.2.1 of [4].

          4.  The MAC Layer selects an SFID ("Y") of an active Service
              Flow belonging to the named class, choosing an SF
              arbitrarily if there is more than one.

          5.  The packet is then classified according to the
              docsIetfQosPktClassTable, which may classify the packet to
              a different SFID "X".  Associated with the classifier is a
              docsIetfQosPktClassPriority.

          6.  In the event of a conflict between the SCN-determined SFID
              and the classified SFID, the greater of
              docsIetfQosPktClassPriority and
              docsIetfQosServiceClassPolicyRulePriority determines which
              SFID is selected to forward the packet.

        A packet which does not match a
        docsIetfQosServiceClassPolicyEntry is directly submitted to the
        DOCSIS MAC layer, where the docsIetfQosPktClassTable selects the
        SID on which it is to be forwarded.

        By convention (in [4]), the "internal"
        docsIetfQosPktClassPriority values should be in the range of
        64-191, while the "external" priorities may be either in the
        range 192-255 to override the internal classification or the
        range 0-63 to be overridden by internal classification.

        This classification mechanism applies both upstream from the CM
        and downstream from the CMTS.



4.  DOCSIS and IPv4 Type-of-Service(ToS) Field

   The DOCSIS-IETF-QOS-MIB MIB module relies on the DOCSIS MAC layer
   protocols and uses objects that reflect the IPv4 Type-of-Service
   (ToS) octet as defined in [14]. The applicability of these objects is
   limited to the DOCSIS access network. The past and current versions
   of the DOCSIS specifications for which this MIB module is defined do
   not reflect Differentiated Services [9] on the DOCSIS access network.
   However, with proper selection of values for these objects, the

   network operator can enforce Differentiated Services Per-hop
   Behaviors (PHBs) on the DOCSIS Access Network, and can configure the
   modification of the DSCP for certain packet flows as they enter the
   metro network from the access network, essentially making the DOCSIS
   access network TOS marking compatible with the wider use of DSCP
   outside DOCSIS networks. It should be noted that because the entire
   IPv4 TOS octet may be available for modification via the latter
   mechanism (due to the current MAC level DOCSIS protocols and CLI
   interface configuration), there is the possibility that the DOCSIS
   network could be configured to modify the Explicit Congestion
   Notification (ECN) bits [10] of certain packets. This modification of
   the ECN bits is prevented by the MIB module's design.  The MIB module
   prohibits the modification of the TOS octet (read-only objects:
   docsIetfQosPktClassIpTosLow, docsIetfQosPktClassIpTosHigh
   docsIetfQosPktClassIpTosMask, docsIetfQosParamSetTosAndMask,
   docsIetfQosParamSetTosOrMask) and allows the DSCP field to be
   modified (read-create object: docsIetfQosServiceClassDSCPOverwrite).

                    DOCSIS 1.0 QOS service profiles are not
                    represented in this table.

                    Each row corresponds to a DOCSIS QOS Parameter Set
                    as signaled via DOCSIS MAC management messages.
                    Each object in the row corresponds to one or
                    part of one DOCSIS 1.1 Service Flow Encoding.
                    The docsIetfQosParamSetBitMap object in the row
                    indicates which particular parameters were signaled
                    in the original registration or dynamic service
                    request message that created the QOS Parameter Set.

                    In many cases, even if a QOS Parameter Set parameter
                    was not signaled, the DOCSIS specification calls
                    for a default value to be used. That default value
                    is reported as the value of the corresponding object
                    in this row.

                    Many objects are not applicable depending on
                    the Service Flow direction or upstream scheduling
                    type.  The object value reported in this case

                    message that created or modified the QOS Parameter

                    by the indicated reference section is present
                    in the original request.

                    Note that when Service Class names are expanded,
                    the registration or dynamic response message may
                    contain parameters as expanded by the CMTS based
                    on a stored service class. These expanded
                    parameters are *not* indicated by a 1 bit in this
                    object.

                    Note that even though some QOS Parameter Set
                    parameters may not be signaled in a message
                    (so that the paramater's bit in this object is 0)
                    the DOCSIS specification calls for default

                    reported as the corresponding object's value in
                    the row.

                    Note that BITS objects are encoded most
                    significant bit first. For example, if bits
                    1 and 16 are set, the value of this object
                    is the octet string '400080'H.

                corresponding values from the named Service Class.

                    A bit value of '0' indicates that
                    the byte should not be suppressed by the sending
                    device or restored by the receiving device.

6.  Security Considerations


   This MIB module relates to a agent which will provide metropolitan
   public internet access.  As such, improper manipulation of the
   objects represented by this MIB module may result in denial of
   service to a large number of end-users [6].  Manipulation of the
   docsIetfQosServiceClassTable and docsIetfQosServiceClassPolicyTable
   may allow an end-user to increase their service levels, or affect
   other end-users in either a positive or negative manner.  In
   addition, manipulation of docsIetfQosServiceFlowLogControl could
   allow an attacker to remove logs of packet and byte counts forwarded
   on a Service Flow. If such logs were used for billing, the attacker
   would obtain free service.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

     o    The docsIetfQosServiceClassTable provides a template of QOS
          parameters such as maximum rate limits for a named service
          class. Changing these parameters would allow an attacker to
          obtain unauthorized class of service.

     o    The docsIetfQosServiceClassPolicyTable applies CMTS vendor
          proprietary policies for packet forwarding, including
          dropping, scheduling, notification, or other policies.
          Changing this table could allow an attacker to deny service
          to all subscribers of the CMTS or grant the attacker
          unauthorized forwarding policies.

     o    The docsIetfQosServiceFlowLogControl object controls the
          deletion of entries in the docsIetfQosServiceFlowLogTable,
          which acts as a historical "detail record" of DOCSIS Service
          Flow packets and bytes transmitted. Such records may be used
          for billing purposes, so the unauthorized deletion of the
          records can result in free service.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt
   the values of these objects when sending them over the network via
   SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

     o    Unauthorized SNMP GET access of the docsIetfQosPktClassTable

          or docsIetfQosPHSTable can allow an attacker to learn IP
          addresses permitted to have enhanced quality of service, for
          possible spoofing.  This table typically contains the IP
          addresses involved in voice-over-IP sessions, for example.

     o    Unauthorized SNMP GET access of the docsIetfQosParamSetTable
          allows an attacker to learn the names of Service Classes
          which are permitted to have enhanced QoS service, and the
          values of that enhanced service. That name can be referenced
          in an unauthorized DOCSIS cable modem configuration file to
          obtain enhanced service.

     o    Unauthorized SNMP GET access of the
          docsIetfQosServiceFlowTable can tell an attacker when
          Service Flows are active, e.g. when a voice-over-IP call is
          in progress.

     o    Unauthorized SNMP GET access of the
          docsIetfQosServiceFlowStatsTable,
          docsIetfQosUpstreamStatsTable,
          docsIetfQosDynamicServiceStatsTable,
          docsIetfQosServiceFlogLogTable,
          and docsIetfQosCmtsMacToSrvFlowTable can tell an attacker the
          volume of traffic to and from any Service Flow in the system,
          resulting in loss of privacy of the amount and direction of
          data transfer.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.  It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the
   security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [15],
   section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic
   mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).  Further, deployment of
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is
   RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.
   It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.



7.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

   --------------    -----------------------
   docsIetfQosMIB    { mib-2 xx }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for xx under the mib-2 subtree and to
   record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace xx (here
   and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove this
   note.
