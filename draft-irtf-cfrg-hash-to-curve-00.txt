1.  Introduction

   Many cryptographic protocols require a procedure which maps arbitrary
   input, e.g., passwords, to points on an elliptic curve (EC).
   Prominent examples include Simple Password Exponential Key Exchange
   [Jablon96], Password Authenticated Key Exchange [BMP00], and Boneh-
   Lynn-Shacham signatures [BLS01].

   Let E be an elliptic curve over base field GF(p).  In practice,
   efficient (polynomial-time) functions that hash arbitrary input to E
   can be constructed by composing a cryptographically secure hash
   function F1 : {0,1}^* ->GF(p) and an injection F2 : GF(p) -> E, i.e.,
   Hash(m) = F2(F1(m)).  Probabilistic constructions of Hash, e.g., the
   MapToGroup function described by Boneh et al.  [BLS01].  Their
   algorithm fails with probability 2^I, where I is a tunable parameter
   that one can control.  Another variant, dubbed the "Try and
   Increment" approach, was described by Boneh et al.  [BLS01].  This
   function works by hashing input m using a standard hash function,
   e.g., SHA256, and then checking to see if the resulting point E(m,
   f(m)), for curve function f, belongs on E.  This algorithm is
   expected to find a valid curve point after approximately two

   attempts, i.e., when ctr=1, on average.  (See Appendix Appendix A for
   a more detailed description of this algorithm.)  Since the running
   time of the algorithm depends on m, this algorithm is NOT safe for
   cases sensitive to timing side channel attacks.  Deterministic
   algorithms are needed in such cases where failures are undesirable.
   Shallue and Woestijne [SWU] first introduced a deterministic
   algorithm that maps elements in F_{q} to an EC in time O(log^4 q),
   where q = p^n for some prime p, and time O(log^3 q) when q = 3 mod 4.
   Icart introduced yet another deterministic algorithm which maps F_{q}
   to any EC where q = 2 mod 3 in time O(log^3 q) [Icart09].  Elligator
   (2) [Elligator2] is yet another deterministic algorithm for any odd-
   characteristic EC that has a point of order 2.  Elligator2 can be
   applied to Curve25519 and Curve448, which are both CFRG-recommended
   curves [RFC7748].

   This document specifies several algorithms for deterministically
   hashing onto a curve with varying properties: Icart, SWU, Simplified
   SWU, and Elligator2.  Each algorithm conforms to a common interface,
   i.e., it maps an element from a base field F to a curve E.  For each
   variant, we describe the requirements for F and E to make it work.
   Sample code for each variant is presented in the appendix.  Unless
   otherwise stated, all elliptic curve points are assumed to be
   represented as affine coordinates, i.e., (x, y) points on a curve.

1.1.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The SWU variant from Section Section 4.2 applies to any curve.  As
   such, this algorithm SHOULD be used if no other better alternative is
   known.  More efficient variants and their curve requirements are
   shown in the table below.  These MAY be used if the target curve
   meets the listed criteria.

3.  Generic Interface

   The generic interface for hashing to elliptic curves is as follows:

   hash_to_curve(alpha)

   where alpha is a message to hash onto a curve.

3.1.  Utility Functions

   Algorithms in this document make use of utility functions described
   below.

   o  HashToBase(x): H(x)[0:log2(p) + 1], i.e., hash-truncate-reduce,
      where H is a cryptographic hash function, such as SHA256, and p is
      the prime order of base field Fp.

   o  CMOV(a, b, c): If c = 1, return a, else return b.

   Note: We assume that HashToBase maps its input to the base field
   uniformly.  In practice, there may be inherent biases in p, e.g., p =
   2^k - 1 will have non-negligible bias in higher bits.

4.  Hashing Variants

4.1.  Icart Method

   The following hash_to_curve_icart(alpha) implements the Icart method
   from [Icart09].  This algorithm works for any curve over F_{p^n},
   where p^n = 2 mod 3 (or p = 2 mod 3 and for odd n), including:

   o  P384

   o  Curve1174

   o  Curve448

   Unsupported curves include: P224, P256, P521, and Curve25519 since,
   for each, p = 1 mod 3.

   Mathematically, given input alpha, and A and B from E, the Icart
   method works as follows:

   u = HashToBase(alpha)
   x = (v^2 - b - (u^6 / 27))^(1/3) + (u^2 / 3)
   y = ux + v

   where v = ((3A - u^4) / 6u).

   The following procedure implements this algorithm in a straight-line
   fashion.  It requires knowledge of A and B, the constants from the
   curve Weierstrass form.  It outputs a point with affine coordinates.

  hash_to_curve_icart(alpha)

  Input:

    alpha - value to be hashed, an octet string

  Output:

    (x, y) - a point in E

  Steps:

  1.   u = HashToBase(alpha)   // {0,1}^* -> Fp
  2.  u2 = u^2 (mod p)         // u^2
  3.  t2 = u2^2 (mod p)        // u^4
  4.  v1 = 3 * A (mod p)       // 3A
  5.  v1 = v1 - t2 (mod p)     // 3A - u^4
  6.  t1 = 6 * u (mod p)       // 6u
  7.  t3 = t1 ^ (-1) (mod p)   // modular inverse
  8.   v = v1 * t3 (mod p)     // (3A - u^4)/(6u)
  9.   x = v^2 (mod p)         // v^2
  10.  x = x - B (mod p)       // v^2 - b
  11. t1 = 27 ^ (-1) (mod p)   // 1/27
  12. t1 = t1 * u2 (mod p)     // u^4 / 27
  13. t1 = t1 * t2 (mod p)     // u^6 / 27
  14.  x = x - t1 (mod p)      // v^2 - b - u^6/27
  15. t1 = (2 * p) - 1 (mod p) // 2p - 1
  16. t1 = t1 / 3 (mod p)      // (2p - 1)/3
  17.  x = x^t1 (mod p)        // (v^2 - b - u^6/27) ^ (1/3)
  18. t2 = u2 / 3 (mod p)      // u^2 / 3
  19.  x = x + t2 (mod p)      // (v^2 - b - u^6/27) ^ (1/3) + (u^2 / 3)
  20.  y = u * x (mod p)       // ux
  21.  y = y + v (mod p)       // ux + v
  22. Output (x, y)


4.2.  Shallue-Woestijne-Ulas Method

   ((TODO: write this section))

4.3.  Simplified SWU Method

   The following hash_to_curve_simple_swu(alpha) implements the
   simplfied Shallue-Woestijne-Ulas algorithm from [SimpleSWU].  This
   algorithm works for any curve over F_{p^n}, where p = 3 mod 4,
   including:

   o  P256

   o  ...

   Given curve equation g(x) = x^3 + Ax + B, this algorithm works as
   follows:

   1. t = HashToBase(alpha)
   2. alpha = (-b / a) * (1 + (1 / (t^4 + t^2)))
   3. beta = -t^2 * alpha
   4. z = t^3 * g(alpha)
   5. Output (-g * alpha) * (g * beta)

   The following procedure implements this algorithm.  It outputs a
   point with affine coordinates.

   hash_to_curve_simple_swu(alpha)

   Input:

     alpha - value to be hashed, an octet string

   Output:

     (x, y) - a point in E

   Steps:

   1.     t = HashToBase(alpha)
   2. alpha = t^2 (mod p)
   3. alpha = alpha * -1 (mod p)
   4. right = alpha^2 + alpha (mod p)
   5. right = right^(-1) (mod p)
   6. right = right + 1 (mod p)
   7.  left = B * -1 (mod p)
   8.  left = left / A (mod p)
   9.    x2 = left * right (mod p)
   10.   x3 = alpha * x2 (mod p)
   11.   h2 = x2 ^ 3 (mod p)
   12.   i2 = x2 * A (mod p)
   13.   i2 = i2 + B (mod p)
   14.   h2 = h2 + i2 (mod p)
   15.   h3 = x3 ^ 3 (mod p)
   16.   i3 = x3 * A (mod p)
   17.   i3 = i3 + B (mod p)
   18.   h3 = h3 + i3 (mod p)
   19.   y1 = h2 ^ ((p + 1) // 4) (mod p)
   20.   y2 = h3 ^ ((p + 1) // 4) (mod p)
   21.    e = (y1 ^ 2 == h2)
   22.    x = CMOV(x2, x3, e)    // If e = 1, choose x2, else choose x3
   23.    y = CMOV(y1, y2, e)    // If e = 1, choose y1, else choose y2
   24. Output (x, y)

4.4.  Elligator2 Method

   The following hash_to_curve_elligator2(alpha) implements the
   Elligator2 method from [Elligator2].  This algorithm works for any
   curve with a point of order 2 and j-invariant != 1728.  Given curve
   equation f(x) = y^2 = x(x^2 + Ax + B), i.e., a Montgomery form with
   the point of order 2 at (0,0), this algorithm works as shown below.
   (Note that any curve with a point of order 2 is isomorphic to this
   representation.)

   1. r = HashToBase(alpha)
   2. If f(-A/(1+ur^2)) is square, then output f(-A/(1+ur^2))^(1/2)
   3. Else, output f(-Aur^2/(1+ur^2))^(1/2)

   Another way to express this algorithm is as follows:

   1. r = HashToBase(alpha)
   2. d = -A / (1 + ur^2)
   3. e = f(d)^((p-1)/2)
   4. u = ed - (1 - e)A/u

   Here, e is the Legendre symbol of y = (d^3 + Ad^2 + d), which will be
   1 if y is a quadratic residue (square) mod p, and -1 otherwise.
   (Note that raising y to ((p -1) / 2) is a common way to compute the
   Legendre symbol.)

   The following procedure implements this algorithm.

   4.   r = nu

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

8.  Security Considerations

   Each hash function variant accepts arbitrary input and maps it to a
   pseudorandom point on the curve.  Points are close to
   indistinguishable from randomly chosen elements on the curve.  Some
   variants variants are not full-domain hashes.  Elligator2, for
   example, only maps strings to "about half of all curve points,"
   whereas Icart's method only covers about 5/8 of the points.

9.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Adam Langley for this detailed
   writeup up Elligator2 with Curve25519 [ElligatorAGL].  We also thank
   Sean Devlin and Thomas Icart for feedback on earlier versions of this

Appendix A.  Try-and-Increment Method

   In cases where constant time execution is not required, the so-called
   try-and-increment method may be appropriate.  As discussion in
   Section Section 1, this variant works by hashing input m using a
   standard hash function ("Hash"), e.g., SHA256, and then checking to
   see if the resulting point E(m, f(m)), for curve function f, belongs
   on E.  This is detailed below.

   1. ctr = 0
   3. h = "INVALID"
   4. While h is "INVALID" or h is EC point at infinity:
      A.  CTR = I2OSP(ctr, 4)
      B.  ctr = ctr + 1
      C.  attempted_hash = Hash(m || CTR)
      D.  h = RS2ECP(attempted_hash)
      E.  If h is not "INVALID" and cofactor > 1, set h = h^cofactor
   5. Output h

   I2OSP is a function that converts a nonnegative integer to octet
   string as defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC8017], and RS2ECP is a
   function that converts of a random 2n-octet string to an EC point as
   specified in Section 5.1.3 of [RFC8032].
