<h1><br />MPLS-TP OAM Analysis<br />draft-ietf-mpls-tp-oam-analysis-01.txt</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document analyzes the set of requirements for Operations,
      Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) for the Transport Profile of
      MPLS(MPLS-TP) as defined in <a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, to
      evaluate whether existing OAM tools (either from the current MPLS
      toolset or from the ITU-T documents) can be applied to these
      requirements. Eventually, the purpose of the document is to recommend
      which of the existing tools should be extended and what new tools should
      be defined to support the set of OAM requirements for MPLS-TP. This
      document reports the conclusions of the MPLS-TP design team discussions
      concerning the MPLS-TP OAM tools at IETF75.

Scope</h3>

<p>OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance) plays a
        significant role in carrier networks, providing methods for fault
        management and performance monitoring in both the transport and the
        service layers in order to improve their ability to support services
        with guaranteed and strict Service Level Agreements (SLAs) while
        reducing their operational costs.

<p><a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Niven-Jenkins, B., Nadeau, T., and C. Pignataro, &ldquo;Requirements for the Trasport Profile of MPLS,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> in general, and <a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> in particular define a set of
        requirements for OAM functionality in MPLS-Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
        for MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs) (network infrastructure) and
        Pseudowires (PWs) (services).
</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to analyze the OAM requirements and
        evaluate whether existing OAM tools defined for MPLS can be used to
        meet the requirements, identify which tools need to be extended to
        comply with the requirements, and which new tools need to be defined.

<p>This document reports the conclusions of the MPLS-TP design team
        discussions on the MPLS-TP OAM tools at IETF75 and the guidelines that
        were agreed. The guidelines refer to a set of existing OAM tools that
        need to be enhanced to fully support the MPLS-TP OAM requirements and
        identify new tools that need to be defined. The organizational
        structure of the documents on MPLS-TP OAM tools was also discussed and
        agreed at IETF75 and is described later in this document.

Organization of the document</h3>

<p>Sections 1.4 &ndash; 1.8 provide an overview of the existing MPLS
        tools.
</p>
<p>Section 2 of the document analyzes the requirements that are
        documented in <a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> and provides
        basic principles of operation for the OAM functionality that is
        required.
</p>
<p>Section 3 evaluates which existing tools can provide coverage for
        the different OAM functions that are required to support MPLS-TP.
</p>
<p>The recommendations are summarized in section 4, and reflect the
        guidelines which were agreed by the MPLS-TP design team during the
        meetings at IETF 75. These guidelines relate to the functionality
        could be covered by the existing toolset and what extensions or new
        tools would be needed in order to provide full coverage of the OAM
        functionality for MPLS-TP.
</p>
<p>The OAM tools for MPLS-TP OAM will be defined in a set of
        documents. Section 5 describes the organization of this set of
        documents as agreed by the MPLS-TP design team at IETF75.

LSP Ping</h3>

<p>LSP Ping is a variation of ICMP Ping and traceroute <a class='info' href='#ICMP'>[ICMP]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Internet Control Message Protocol,&rdquo; Sept&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a> adapted to the needs of MPLS LSP. Forwarding, of
        the LSP Ping packets, is based upon the LSP Label and label stack, in
        order to guarantee that the echo messages are switched in-band (i.e.
        over the same data route) of the LSP. However, it should be noted that
        the messages are transmitted using IP/UDP encapsulation and IP
        addresses in the 127/8 (loopback) range. The use of the loopback range
        guarantees that the LSP Ping messages will be terminated, by a loss of
        connectivity or inability to continue on the path, without being
        transmitted beyond the LSP. For a bi-directional LSP (either
        associated or co-routed) the return message of the LSP Ping could be
        sent on the return LSP. For unidirectional LSPs and in some case for
        bi-directional LSPs, the return message may be sent using IP
        forwarding to the IP address of the LSP ingress node.
</p>
<p>LSP Ping extends the basic ICMP Ping operation (of data-plane
        connectivity and continuity check) with functionality to verify
        data-plane vs. control-plane consistency for a Forwarding Equivalence
        Class (FEC) and also Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) problems. The
        traceroute functionality may be used to isolate and localize the MPLS
        faults, using the Time-to-live (TTL) indicator to incrementally
        identify the sub-path of the LSP that is successfully traversed before
        the faulty link or node.
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, LSP Ping requires the presence of the MPLS
        control plane when verifying the consistency of the data-plane against
        the control-plane. However, LSP Ping is not dependent on the MPLS
        control-plane for its operation, i.e. even though the propagation of
        the LSP label may be performed over the control-plane via the Label
        Distribution Protocol (LDP).
</p>
<p>It should be noted that LSP Ping does support unique identification
        of the LSP within an addressing domain. The identification is checked
        using the full FEC identification. LSP Ping is easily extensible to
        include additional information needed to support new functionality, by
        use of Type-Length-Value (TLV) constructs.
</p>
<p>LSP Ping can be activated both in on-demand and pro-active
        (asynchronous) modes, as defined in <a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#P2MP LSP Ping'>[P2MP LSP Ping]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nadeau, T. and A. Farrel, &ldquo;Detecting Data Plane Failures in Point-to-Multipoint           Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) - Extensions to LSP           Ping,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> clarifies the applicability of
        LSP Ping to MPLS P2MP LSPs, and extends the techniques and mechanisms
        of LSP Ping to the MPLS P2MP environment.

        over MPLS tunnels or for a stitched LSP.
</p>
<p>As pointed out above, TTL exhaust is the method used to terminate
        flows at intermediate LSRs. This is used as part of the traceroute of
        a path and to locate a problem that was discovered previously.
</p>
<p>Some of the drawbacks identified with LSP Ping include - LSP Ping
        is considered to be computational intensive as pointed out in <a class='info' href='#MPLS BFD'>[MPLS BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aggarwal, R., Kompella, K., Nadeau, T., and G. Swallow, &ldquo;BFD For MPLS LSPs,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. The applicability for a pro-active mode of
        operation is analyzed in the sections below. Use of the loopback
        address range (to protect against leakage outside the LSP) assumes
        that all of the intermediate nodes support some IP functionality. Note
        that ECMP is not supported in MPLS-TP, therefore its implication on
        OAM capabilities is not analyzed in this document.

MPLS BFD</h3>

<p>BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) <a class='info' href='#BASE BFD'>[BASE BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Katz, D. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> is a mechanism that is defined for fast
        fault detection for point-to-point connections. BFD defines a simple
        packet that may be transmitted over any protocol, dependent on the
        application that is employing the mechanism. BFD is dependent upon
        creation of a session that is agreed upon by both ends of the link
        (which may be a single link, LSP, etc.) that is being checked. The
        session is assigned a separate identifier by each end of the path
        being monitored. This session identifier is by nature only unique
        within the context of node that assigned it. As part of the session
        creation, the end-points negotiate an agreed transmission rate for the
        BFD packets. BFD supports an echo function to check the continuity,
        and verify the reachability of the desired destination. BFD does not
        support neither a discovery mechanism nor a traceroute capability for
        fault localization, these must be provided by use of other mechanisms.
        The BFD packets support authentication between the routers being
        checked.
</p>
<p>BFD can be used in pro-active (asynchronous) and on-demand modes,
        as defined in <a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, of
        operation.
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#MPLS BFD'>[MPLS BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aggarwal, R., Kompella, K., Nadeau, T., and G. Swallow, &ldquo;BFD For MPLS LSPs,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> defines the use of BFD for P2P LSP
        end-points and is used to verify data-plane continuity. It uses a
        simple hello protocol which can be easily implemented in hardware. The
        end-points of the LSP exchange hello packets at negotiated regular
        intervals and an end-point is declared down when expected hello
        packets do not show up. Failures in each direction can be monitored
        independently using the same BFD session. The use of the BFD echo
        function and on-demand activation are outside the scope of the MPLS
        BFD specification.
</p>
<p>The BFD session mechanism requires an additional (external)
        mechanism to bootstrap and bind the session to a particular LSP or
        FEC. LSP Ping is designated by <a class='info' href='#MPLS BFD'>[MPLS BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Aggarwal, R., Kompella, K., Nadeau, T., and G. Swallow, &ldquo;BFD For MPLS LSPs,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> as the
        bootstrap mechanism for the BFD session in an MPLS environment. The
        implication is that the session establishment BFD messages for MPLS
        are transmitted using a IP/UDP encapsulation.
</p>
<p>In order to be able to identify certain extreme cases of
        mis-connectivity, it is necessary that each managed connection have
        its own unique identifiers. BFD uses Discriminator values to identify
        the connection being verified, at both ends of the path. These
        discriminator values are set by each end-node to be unique only in the
        context of that node. This limited scope of uniqueness would not
        identify a misconnection of crossing paths that could assign the same
        discriminators to the different sessions.

PW VCCV</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#PW VCCV'>[PW VCCV]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nadeau, T. and C. Pignataro, &ldquo;Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV):           A Control Channel for Pseudowires,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> provides end-to-end fault detection
        and diagnostics for PWs (regardless of the underlying tunneling
        technology). The VCCV switching function provides a control channel
        associated with each PW (based on the PW Associated Channel Header
        (ACH) which is defined in <a class='info' href='#PW ACH'>[PW ACH]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bryant, S., Swallow, G., Martini, L., and D. McPherson, &ldquo;Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Control Word for Use           over an MPLS PSN,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>), and allows
        sending OAM packets in-band with PW data (using CC Type 1: In-band
        VCCV)
</p>
<p>VCCV currently supports the following OAM mechanisms: ICMP Ping,
        LSP Ping, and BFD. ICMP and LSP Ping are IP encapsulated before being
        sent over the PW ACH. BFD for VCCV supports two modes of encapsulation
        - either IP/UDP encapsulated (with IP/UDP header) or PW-ACH
        encapsulated (with no IP/UDP header) and provides support to signal
        the AC status. The use of the VCCV control channel provides the
        context, based on the MPLS-PW label, required to bind and bootstrap
        the BFD session to a particular pseudo wire (FEC), eliminating the
        need to exchange Discriminator values.
</p>
<p>VCCV consists of two components: (1) signaled component to
        communicate VCCV capabilities as part of VC label, and (2) switching
        component to cause the PW payload to be treated as a control
        packet.
</p>
<p>VCCV is not directly dependent upon the presence of a control
        plane. The VCCV capability negotiation may be performed as part of the
        PW signaling when LDP is used. In case of manual configuration of the
        PW, it is the responsibility of the operator to set consistent options
        at both ends.

IETF Performance Measurement</h3>

<p>OWAMP (One-Way Active Measurement Protocol) <a class='info' href='#RFC4656'>[RFC4656]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shalunov, S., Teitelbaum, B., Karp, A., Boote, J., and M. Zekauskas, &ldquo;A One-way Active Measurement Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a> 
		enables measurement of unidirectional characteristics of IP networks, 
		such as packet loss and one-way delay. For its proper operation OWAMP 
		requires accurate time of day setting at its end points.
</p>
<p>TWAMP (Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol) <a class='info' href='#RFC5357'>[RFC5357]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hedayat, K., Krzanowski, R., Morton, A., Yum, K., and J. Babiarz, &ldquo;A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol,&rdquo; Oct&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> 
		is a similar protocol that enables measurement of two-way (round trip) 
		characteristics. TWAMP does not require accurate time of day, and, 
		furthermore, allows the use of a simple session reflector, making it 
		an attractive alternative to OWAMP.
</p>
<p>Both OWAMP and TWAMP consist of inter-related control and test 
		protocols, although &quot;TWAMP Light&quot; eliminates the need for 
		the control protocol.
</p>
<p>OWAMP and TWAMP control protocols run over TCP, while the test 
		protocols run over UDP. The purpose of the control protocols is to 
		initiate, start, and stop test sessions, and for OWAMP to fetch results. 
		The test protocols introduce test packets (which contain sequence 
		numbers and timestamps) along the IP path under test according to a 
		schedule, and record statistics of packet arrival. Multiple sessions 
		may be simultaneously defined, each with a session identifier, and 
		defining the number of packets to be sent, the amount of padding to be 
		added (and thus the packet size), the start time, and the send schedule 
		(which can be either a constant time between test packets or exponentially 
		distributed pseudo-random).  Statistics recorded conform to the relevant 
		IPPM RFCs.
</p>
<p>OWAMP defines the following logical roles: Session-Sender, 
		Session-Receiver, Server, Control-Client, and Fetch-Client. The 
		Session-Sender originates test traffic that is received by the 
		Session-receiver. The Server configures and manages the session, as well 
		as returning the results. The Control-Client initiates requests for test 
		sessions, triggers their start, and may trigger their termination. The 
		Fetch-Client requests the results of a completed session.  Multiple roles 
		may be combined in a single host &ndash; for example, one host may play 
		the roles of Control-Client, Fetch-Client, and Session-Sender, and a 
		second playing the roles of Server and Session-Receiver.
</p>
<p>In a typical OWAMP session the Control-Client establishes a TCP 
		connection to port 861 of the Server, which responds with a server 
		greeting message indicating supported security/integrity modes. The 
		Control-Client responds with the chosen communications mode and the 
		Server accepts the modes.  The Control-Client then requests and fully 
		describes a test session to which the Server responds with its acceptance 
		and supporting information.  More than one test session may be requested 
		with additional messages.  The Control-Client then starts a test session 
		and the Server acknowledges.  The Session-Sender then sends test packets 
		with pseudorandom padding to the Session-Receiver until the session is 
		complete or until the Control-Client stops the session. Once finished, 
		the Fetch-Client sends a fetch request to the server, which responds with 
		an acknowledgement and immediately thereafter the result data.
</p>
<p>TWAMP defines the following logical roles: session-sender, 
		session-reflector, server, and control-client. These are similar to the 
		OWAMP roles, except that the Session-Reflector does not collect any 
		packet information, and there is no need for a Fetch-Client.
</p>
<p>In a typical TWAMP session the Control-Client establishes a TCP 
		connection to port 862 of the Server, and mode is negotiated as in OWAMP.  
		The Control-Client then requests sessions and starts them.  The 
		Session-Sender sends test packets with pseudorandom padding to the 
		Session-Reflector which returns them with insertion of timestamps.
</p>
<p>OWAMP and TWAMP test traffic is designed with security in mind. Test 
		packets are hard to detect because they are simply UDP streams between 
		negotiated port numbers, with potentially nothing static in the packets.  
		OWAMP and TWAMP also include optional authentication and encryption for 
		both control and test packets.

Architectural requirements and general principles of operation</h3>

<p>
</p>
<p><a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> defines a set of requirements
      on OAM architecture and general principles of operations which are
      evaluated below:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li><a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> requires that OAM mechanisms
          in MPLS-TP are independent of the transmission media and of the
          client service being emulated by the PW. The existing tools comply
          with this requirement.
</li>
<li><a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> requires that the MPLS-TP OAM
          MUST be able to support both an IP based and non-IP based
          environment. If the network is IP based, i.e. IP routing and
          forwarding are available, then the MPLS-TP OAM toolset MUST be able
          to operate by relying on the IP routing and forwarding capabilities.
          All of the existing MPLS tools (i.e. LSP Ping, VCCV Ping, MPLS BFD,
          and VCCV BFD) can support this functionality. The Y.1731 toolset
          does not specifically support this functionality, but rather relies
          on underlying technologies for forwarding. The forwarding could also
          be supported over IP, e.g. by using a VCCV extension. Note that some
          of the MPLS-TP tools such as Alarm Report are very transport
          oriented and may not support IP functionality.
</li>
<li><a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> requires that MPLS-TP OAM MUST
          be able to operate without IP functionality and without relying on
          control and/or management planes. It is required that OAM
          functionality MUST NOT be dependent on IP routing and forwarding
          capabilities. Except for the LSP Ping operation of verifying the
          data-plane vs. the control-plane, the existing tools do not rely on
          control and/or management plane, however the following should be
          observed regarding the reliance on IP functionality:
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>LSP Ping, VCCV Ping, and MPLS BFD make use of IP header
            (UDP/IP) and do not completely comply with the requirement. In the
            on-demand mode, LSP Ping also may use IP forwarding to reply back
            to the source router. This dependence on IP, has further
            implications concerning the use of LSP Ping as the bootstrap
            mechanism for BFD for MPLS. There are extensions to LSP-Ping that
            are under discussion that allow LSP-Ping to restrict replies to
            the backside of a bidirectional LSP.
</li>
<li>VCCV BFD supports the use of PW-ACH encapsulated BFD sessions
            for PWs and can comply with the requirement.
</li>
<li>Y.1731 PDU are technology agnostic and thereby not dependent on
            IP functionality. These PDU could be carried by VCCV or G-ACH
            control channels.
</li>
</ul>
<li><a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> requires that OAM tools for
          fault management do not rely on user traffic, and the existing MPLS
          OAM tools and Y.1731 already comply with this requirement.
</li>
<li>It is also required that OAM packets and the user traffic are
          congruent (i.e. OAM packets are transmitted in-band) and there is a
          need to differentiate OAM packets from user-plane ones.
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>For PWs, VCCV provides a control channel that can be associated
            with each PW which allows sending OAM packets in band of PWs and
            allow the receiving end-point to intercept, interpret, and process
            them locally as OAM messages. VCCV defines different VCCV
            Connectivity Verification Types for MPLS (like ICMP Ping, LSP Ping
            and IP/UDP encapsulated BFD and PW-ACH encapsulated BFD).
</li>
<li>Currently there is no distinct OAM payload identifier in MPLS
            shim. BFD and LSP Ping packets for LSPs are carried over UDP/IP
            and are addressed to the loopback address range. The router at the
            end-point intercepts, interprets, and processes the packets. <a class='info' href='#MPLS G-ACH'>[MPLS G&#8209;ACH]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bocci, M., Bryant, S., and M. Vigoureux, &ldquo;MPLS Generic Associated Channel,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> generalizes the use of the PW ACH and
            enables provision of control channels at the MPLS LSP and sections
            levels. This new mechanism would support carrying the existing
            MPLS OAM messages or the Y.1731 messages at the LSP and the
            section levels to be transmitted over the G-ACH.
</li>
</ul>
<li><a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> requires that the MPLS-TP OAM
          mechanism allows the propagation of AC (Attachment Circuit) failures
          and their clearance across a MPLS-TP domain
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>BFD for VCCV supports a mechanism for "Fault detection and
            AC/PW Fault status signaling." This can be used for both IP/UDP
            encapsulated or PW-ACH encapsulated BFD sessions, i.e. by setting
            the appropriate VCCV Connectivity Verification Type.This mechanism
            could support this requirement. Note that in the PWE3 WG there are
            two proposals regarding how to transmit the AC failures over an
            ACH that may be applicable to this requirement.
</li>
</ul>
<li><a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> requires a single OAM
          technology and consistent OAM capabilities for LSPs, PWs, and
          Sections. The existing set of tools defines a different way of
          operating the OAM functions (e.g. LSP Ping to bootstrap MPLS BFD vs.
          VCCV). Currently, the Y.1731 functionality is defined for Ethernet
          paths, and the procedures could readily be redefined for the various
          MPLS-TP path concepts.
</li>
<li><a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> requires allowing OAM packets
          to be directed to an intermediate point of a LSP/PW. Technically,
          this could be supported by the proper setting of the TTL value. It
          is also recommended to include the identifier of the intermediate
          point within the OAM message to allow the intermediate point to
          validate that the message is really intended for it. The information
          can be included in an ACH-TLV according to the definitions in <a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP ACH TLV'>[MPLS&#8209;TP ACH TLV]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Boutros, S., Bryant, S., Sivabalan, S., Swallow, G., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Definition of ACH TLV Structure,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. The applicability of such a solution
          needs to be examined per OAM function. For details, see below.
</li>
<li><a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> suggests that OAM messages MAY
          be authenticated. BFD defines support for optional authentication
          fields using different authentication methods as defined in <a class='info' href='#BASE BFD'>[BASE BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Katz, D. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. Other tools should support this capability as
          well. Y.1731 functionality uses the identification of the path for
          authentication. Authentication information could be included in an
          optional TLV field according to the definitions in <a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP ACH TLV'>[MPLS&#8209;TP ACH TLV]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Boutros, S., Bryant, S., Sivabalan, S., Swallow, G., and D.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Architectural and Principles of Operation &ndash; Recommendations and Guidelines</h3>

<p>Based on the requirements analysis above, the following guidelines
        should be followed to create an OAM environment that could more fully
        support the requirements cited:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Define a generalized addressing scheme that can also support
            unique identification of the monitored paths (or connections).
</li>
<li>Use G-ACH for LSP and section levels.
</li>
<li>Define architectural element that is based on LSP hierarchy to
            apply the mechanisms to segments and concatenated segments.
</li>
<li>Apply BFD to these new mechanisms using the control channel
            encapsulation, as defined above &ndash; allowing use of BFD for
            MPLS-TP independent of IP functionality. This could be used to
            address the CC-V functionality, described below.
</li>
<li>Similarly, LSP Ping could be extended to use only the LSP path
            (in both directions) without IP Forwarding. Addressing for PW can
            be included by using the VCCV mechanism. LSP Ping could be used to
            address the CC-V, Route Tracing, RDI, and Lock/Alarm Reporting
            functionality cited in the requirements.
</li>
<li>The Y.1731 PDU set could be used as a basis for defining the
            information units to be transmitted over the G-ACH. The actual
            procedures and addressing schemes would need to be adjusted for
            the MPLS-TP environment.
</li>
<li>Define a mechanism that could be used to idnetify an
            intermediate point of a path in a unique way, to support the
            maintenance functions. This addressing should be flexible to allow
            support for different addressing schemes, and would supplement the
            TTL exception mechanism to allow an OAM packet to be intercepted
            by intermediate nodes.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating these extensions/mechanisms would fulfill the following
        architectural requirements, mentioned above:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Independence of IP forwarding and routing, when needed.
</li>
<li>OAM packets should be transmitted in-band.
</li>
<li>Support a single OAM technology for LSP, PW, and Sections.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, the following additional requirements can be
        satisfied:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Provide the ability to carry other types of communications
            (e.g., APS, Management Control Channel (MCC), Signaling Control
            Channel (SCC)), by defining new types of communication channels
            for PWs, Sections, and LSPs.
</li>
<li>The design of the OAM mechanisms for MPLS-TP MUST allow the
            ability to support vendor specific and experimental OAM
            functions.
</li>
</ul>

MPLS-TP OAM Functions</h3>

Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification</h3>

<p>Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification (CC-V) are OAM
        operations generally used in tandem, and compliment each other. These
        functions may be split into separate mechanisms. Together they are
        used to detect loss of traffic continuity and misconnections between
        path end-points and are useful for applications like Fault Management,
        Performance Monitoring and Protection Switching, etc. To guarantee
        that CC-V can identify misconnections from cross-connections it is
        necessary that the tool use network-wide unique identifiers for the
        path that is being checked in the session.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.1.1.&nbsp;
Existing tools</h3>

<p>LSP Ping provides much of the functionality required for
          co-routed bidirectional LSPs. As observed above, LSP Ping may be
          operated in both asynchronous and on-demand mode. Addressing is
          based on the full FEC identification that provides a unique
          identifier, and the basic functionality only requires support for
          the loopback address range in each node on the LSP path.
</p>
<p>BFD defines functionality that can be used to support the
          pro-active OAM CC-V function when operated in the asynchronous mode.
          However, the current definition of basic BFD is dependent on use of
          LSP Ping to bootstrap the BFD session. Regarding the connectivity
          functional aspects, basic BFD has a limitation that it uses only
          locally unique (to each node) session identifiers.
</p>
<p>VCCV can be used to carry either LSP Ping or BFD packets that are
          not IP/UDP encapsulated for CC-V on a PW. Note that PW
          termination/switching points use only locally unique (to each node)
          labels. The PW label identifies the path uniquely only at the LSP
          level.
</p>
<p>Y.1731 provides functionality for all aspects of CC-V for an
          Ethernet environment, this could be translated for the MPLS-TP
          environment. The CCM PDU defined in <a class='info' href='#Y.1731'>[Y.1731]<span> (</span><span class='info'>International Telecommunications             Union - Standardization, &ldquo;OAM functions and mechanisms for Ethernet based           networks,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>
          includes the ability to set the frequency of the messages that are
          transmitted, and provides for attaching the address of the path (in
          the Ethernet case &ndash; the MEG Level) and a sequencing number to
          verify that CCM messages were not dropped.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.2"></a><h3>3.1.2.&nbsp;
Gap analysis</h3>

<p>LSP Ping could be used to cover the cases of co-routed
          bidirectional LSPs. However, there is a certain amount of
          computational overhead involved with use of LSP Ping (as was
          observed in sec 1.1), the verification of the control-plane, and the
          need to support the loopback functionality at each intermediate
          node. LSP Ping uses a fully qualified LSP identifier, and when used
          in conjunction with VCCV would use the PW label to identify the
          transport path. LSP Ping can be extended to bypass the verification
          of the control plane
</p>
<p>BFD could be extended to fill the gaps indicated above. The
          extension would include: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>A mechanism should be defined to carry BFD packets over LSP
              without reliance on IP functionality.
</li>
<li>A mechanism should be defined to bootstrap BFD sessions for
              MPLS that is not dependent on UDP.
</li>
<li>BFD needs to be used in conjunction with "globally" unique
              identifiers for the path or ME being checked to allow
              connectivity verfication support. There are two possibilities,
              to allow BFD to support this new type of identifier &ndash;
              
<ul class="text">
<li>Change the semantics of the two Discriminator fields that
                  exist in BFD and have each node select the ME unique
                  identifier. This may have backward compatibility
                  implications.
</li>
<li>Create a new optional field in the packet carrying the
                  BFD that would identify the path being checked, in addition
                  to the existing session identifiers.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extensions to BFD would be needed to cover P2MP
              connections.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Use of the Y.1731 functionality is another option that could be
          considered. The basic PDU for CCM includes (in the flags field) an
          indication of the frequency of the packets [eliminating the need to
          "negotiate" the frequency between the end-points], and also a flag
          used for RDI. The procedure itself would need adaptation to comply
          with the MPLS environment.
</p>
<p>An additional option would be to create a new tool that would
          give coverage for both aspects of CC-V according to the requirements
          and the principles of operation (see section 2.1). This option is
          less preferable.

Alarm Reporting</h3>

<p>Alarm Reporting is a function that is used by an intermediate point

        condition indirectly affecting that path. Such information may be used
        by the endpoints, for example, to suppress alarms that may be
        generated by maintenance end-points of the path. This function should
        also have the capability to differentiate an administrative lock from
        a failure condition at a different execution level.

      (especially for performance monitoring) could also be adapted.
</p>
<p>The guidelines that are used in this document are as follows:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Re-use/extend existing IETF protocols wherever applicable.
</li>
<li>Define new message format for each of the rest of the OAM
        functions, which are aligned with the ACH and ACH-TLV definitions, and
        includes only relevant information.
</li>
<li>Adapt Y.1731 functionality where applicable (mainly for performance
        monitoring).
</li>
</ul>
<p>The recommendations on the MPLS-TP OAM tools are as follows:
</p>
<p>
        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Define a maintenance entity that could be applied both to LSPs
          and PWs that would support management of a sub-path. This entity
          should allow for transmission of traffic by means of label stacking
          and proper TTL setting.
</li>
<li>Extend the control and the management planes to support the
          configuration of the OAM maintenance entities and the set of
          functions to be supported by these entities.
</li>
<li>Define a mechanism that would allow the unique addressing of the
          elements that need to be monitored, e.g., the connections,
          end-points, and intermediate points of a path. This mechanism needs
          to be flexible enough to support different addressing schemes, e.g.
          IP addresses, NSAP, connection names. As pointed out above, LSP Ping
          uses the full FEC identifier for the LSP - this could easily be
          applied to Section OAM since this would be considered as a stacked
          LSP.
</li>
<li>The appropriate assignment of network-wide unique identifiers for
          transport paths, needed to support connectivity verification, should
          be considered.
</li>
<li>Extend existing MPLS tools to disengage from IP forwarding
          mechanisms.
</li>
<li>Extend BFD to support the proactive CC-V functionalities. The
          extensions should address the gaps described above.
</li>
<li>Extend LSP Ping to support the on-demand Connectivity
          Verification functionality. The extensions should address the gaps
          described above.
</li>
<li>Define a new PDU which will be transmitted over G-ACH to support
          the Alarm Reporting functionality for data-plane implementations.
          Describe how Alarm Reporting can be supported by a control-plane and
          by a management-plane.
</li>
<li>Define a new PDU which will be transmitted over G-ACH to support
          the Lock Reporting functionality. Use the same procedures as for

Proactive CC and CV BFD tool analysis</h3>

<p>This appendix is focused on analyzing possible solutions and evaluating 
	  their pros&amp;cons for defining an MPLS-TP OAM mechanism BFD based,to meet 
	  the requirements for proactive Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification 
	  functionality as required in <a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. 
</p>
<p>The BFD tool needs to be extended for the CV functionality by the addition 
	  of a unique identifier in order to meet the requirements.  Proactive Continuity 
	  Check (CC) and Continuity Verification (CV) function are used together to detect 
	  loss of continuity (LOC), unintended connectivity between two MEs (e.g. 
	  mismerging or misconnection) as well as unintended connectivity within the ME 
	  with an unexpected MEP. It MUST operate both in bidirectional p2p and in 
	  unidirectional p2mp connection.
</p>
<p>The mechanism MUST foresee the configuration of the transmit frequency.
</p>
<p>The mechanism is RECOMMENDED be the same for LSP, (MS-)PW and Section (See 
	  <a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Reqs'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Reqs]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vigoureux, M., Betts, M., and D. Ward, &ldquo;Requirements for OAM in MPLS Transport Networks,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>)

Possible Solution</h3>

<p>Several solutions have been analyzed:
</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Define a new BFD version (BFDv2) that extends the current BFD (BFDv1) 
			to support also CV functionality. The new BFD version can be obtained by:
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>changing the semantic of MY discriminator and Your discriminator 
			  fields <a class='info' href='#BASE BFD'>[BASE BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Katz, D. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>,
</li>
<li>adding a new globally unique source MEP ID field in the BFD packet 
			  for the CV functionality to the existing session identifier.
</li>
</ul>
<li>Define two separate tools, running with two different ACH encapsulations 
			(i.e. two different ACH channel types):
</li>
<ul class="text">
<li>the current BFD with only CC functionality however profiled in behavior 
			  to meet the CC MPLS-TP requirement;
</li>
<li>a new tool that meet all the MPLS-TP OAM proactive CV requirement.
</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>The new tool can be:
</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>based on current BFD;
</li>
<li>an extension of the ACH encapsulation for the current BFD;
</li>
<li>a new tool like Y.1731 CCM;
</li>

		to include the MPLS-TP OAM mechanism too. This is due to the fact that VCCV also

<a name="rfc.section.A.2"></a><h3>Appendix A.2.&nbsp;
Backward compatibility</h3>

<p>For backward compatibility, it is possible to run the current BFD that supports 
		only CC functionality on some transport paths and the new tool that supports CC 
		and proactive CV functionality on other transport paths. In any case only one tool 
		for OAM instance at time, configurable by operator, can run.
</p>
<p>A MEP that is configured to support proactive CV functionality MUST be capable 
		to receive existing BFD packets (encapsulated with GAL/G-ACH or PW-ACH) that 
		supports only CC functionality and MUST consider them as an unexpected packet, 
		i.e. detect a misconnection defect and vice versa.
</p>
<p>The context of MPLS-TP OAM packets is based on MPLS label and G-ACH, 
		eliminating in the BFD the need to exchange Discriminator values. An MPLS-TP node 
		that desires to interoperate with a current BFD can apply the same discriminator 
		field semantic as described in <a class='info' href='#BASE BFD'>[BASE BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Katz, D. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> or:
</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>It MUST set the My discriminator field to a nonzero value (it can be a 
		  fixed value);
</li>
<li>It MUST reflect back the received value of My discriminator field into the 
		  transmitted Your discriminator field, or set it to zero if that value is 
		  unknown.

Remote Defect Indication</h3>

<p>Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is used by a MEP to notify its peer MEP that 
		a defect is detected on a bi-directional connection between them). RDI is only 
		used for bidirectional connections and is associated with proactive CC &amp; 
		CV packet generation.<a class='info' href='#MPLS-TP OAM Frwk'>[MPLS&#8209;TP OAM Frwk]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Busi, I. and B. Niven-Jenkins, &ldquo;MPLS-TP OAM Framework and Overview,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> The Diagnostic (Diag) 
		field of the Current BFD can be used for this functionality. However, there 
		isn&#039;t a total correspondence among the values foreseen by <a class='info' href='#BASE BFD'>[BASE BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Katz, D. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> and the defect conditions detected by the proactive CC-CV 
		tool that require the RDI function.
</p>
<p>A solution could be that any defect that requires the RDI information being 
		sent to the peer MEP is encoded in the Diagnostic (Diag) field with the value 1 
		(corresponding to the &quot;Control Detection Time Expired&quot; in 
		<a class='info' href='#BASE BFD'>[BASE BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Katz, D. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. The value 0 indicates RDI condition has been 
		cleared.
</p>
<p>For the solution in section <a class='info' href='#A4s3'>Appendix&nbsp;A.4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>New tool like Y.1731 CCM</span><span>)</span></a> , RDI is foreseen in 
		the packet format with a single bit.

<a name="rfc.section.A.6"></a><h3>Appendix A.6.&nbsp;
Point to Multipoint transport paths</h3>

<p>Solution described in section <a class='info' href='#A4s3'>Appendix&nbsp;A.4.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>New tool like Y.1731 CCM</span><span>)</span></a> is valid for both 
		bidirectional and unidirectional connection: in unidirectional connection only 
		source MEP is enabled only to generate CC/CV OAM packets and sink MEP is 
		enabled only to receive CC/CV OAM packets.
</p>
<p>The BFD tool has a straightforward state machine for bidirectional path. 
		Anyway the behavior and state machine need to be modified for the unidirectional 
		connection; this is described in <a class='info' href='#bfdMultipoint'>[bfdMultipoint]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Katz, D. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection for Multipoint Networks,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.A.7"></a><h3>Appendix A.7.&nbsp;
Security Considerations</h3>

<p>Base BFD <a class='info' href='#BASE BFD'>[BASE BFD]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Katz, D. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> foresees an optional authentication 
		section; that can be extended even to the tool proposed in this document.
</p>
<p>Authentication methods that require checksum calculation on the outgoing 
		packet must extend the checksum even on the ME Identifier Section. This is 
		possible but seems uncorrelated with the solution proposed in section 
		<a class='info' href='#A4s1'>Appendix&nbsp;A.4.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>New tool based on current BFD</span><span>)</span></a> in this case it could be better to use the simple 
		password authentication method.
</p>
<p>It is also worth noticing that the interactions between authentication 
		and connectivity verification need further analysis.
