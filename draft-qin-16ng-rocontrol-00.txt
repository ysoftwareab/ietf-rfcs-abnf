1.  Introduction

   According to RFC 3775[RFC3775], mobile nodes can provide current
   care-of address to correspondent nodes through the correspondent
   registration.  Mobile nodes may use route optimization and send
   packets with the Home Address destination option.  This manner of
   delivering packets does not require going through the home network,
   and typically will enable faster and more reliable transmission.
   However, home network will not be able to transport, control and
   account mobile nodes' traffic by itself, though access service
   provider could offer accounting information to home service provider
   which has accounting agreement with access service provider.  This
   feature restricts service control and account policy which could be
   exploited by network service provider.  This document proposes a
   method for network to control whether to allow mobile nodes to
   optimize route.


2.  Route Optimization Controlled by Network

   Either Home network or local access network can gate route
   optimization procedure.  This section introduces both of them.

2.1.  Controlled by Home Network

   Home agent can inform mobile nodes that route optimization feature is
   not supported and mobile nodes should not initialize Return Route
   test procedure.  As mobile nodes register binding entries with home
   agent, home agent could identify whether route optimization function
   is allowed in Bind Acknowledgement message by using a bit, as shown
   in Section 3.

   Before correspondent registration, the return routability procedure
   should be executed to authorize registrations.  The return
   routability procedure is formed by four messages as below:

      Home Test Init

      Care-of Test Init

      Home Test

      Care-of Test

   The Home Test Init message is reverse tunneled through the home
   agent.  In order to control route optimization, Home agent may gate
   return route test procedure.  For example, home agent can identify
   the Home Test Init message, and gate it according to mobile node's

   profile which sources from AAA infrastructure.  While correspondent
   nodes do not receive Home Test Init message, return route test
   procedure could not be finished.  Then, mobile nodes always route
   datagrams through home agent.

2.2.  Controlled by Access Network

   Access network may acquire whether route optimization feature could
   be supported according to mobile nodes' profile sourced from home AAA
   infrastructure during access authentication.  If mobile node who is
   assigned care-of address sends datagrams to correspondent nodes'
   address instead of home agent address, access router may dump these
   packets.  Similarly, access router may dump packets sourced from
   correspondent nodes.


3.  Message Formats

3.1.  Binding Acknowledgement Message

   The Binding Acknowledgement is used to both acknowledge receipt of a
   Binding Update and inform support of route optimization.

   Route Optimization (O)

      If this bit is cleared, route optimization is not supported by
      home agent.  Mobile nodes should not initialize return route test
      procedure after this flag is received.

   Other bits and options are not changed in this document.
