                      draft-templin-aeromin-00.txt

Abstract

   Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO) specifies both a
   control messaging facility and an encapsulation format for managing
   tunnels over an enterprise network or other Internetwork.  Although
   AERO can operate with any tunnel encapsulation format, the base
   document considers IP-in-UDP-in-IP encapsulation as the default.
   This document presents a minimal encapsulation format for AERO for
   use when a UDP header is not needed.

1.  Introduction

   Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO) [I-D.templin-aerolink]
   specifies both a control messaging facility and an encapsulation
   format for forwarding Internet Protocol (IP) packets [RFC0791]
   [RFC2460] over an enterprise network or other Internetwork through a
   process known as tunneling.  Although AERO can operate with any
   tunnel encapsulation format, the base document specifies the
   insertion of a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) header [RFC0768] with
   port 8060 between the inner and outer IP headers, i.e., as IP-in-UDP-
   in-IP.  This document presents a minimal encapsulation format for
   AERO for use when a UDP header is not needed.

   In its minimal form, AERO can use direct IP-in-IP encapsulation
   [RFC2003][RFC2473][RFC4213] with no intermediate layer between the
   inner and outer IP headers for interior routing and addressing
   services.  The encapsulation is therefore only differentiated from
   other IP-in-IP tunnel types through the application of AERO control
   messaging facilities.

   However, the tunnel fragmentation required by AERO to support a
   guaranteed minimum 1500 bytes cannot be accomplished by inserting an
   IPv6 Fragment Header immediately following the UDP header, since the
   UDP header is not included for minimal encapsulation.  Instead, the
   IPv6 fragment header is inserted directly between the inner and outer
   IP headers when needed, i.e., even if the outer header is IPv4.  The
   IPv6 Fragment Header is identified to the outer IP layer by its IP
   protocol number, and the Next Header field in the IPv6 Fragment
   Header identifies the inner IP header version.

3.  When to Insert the IPv6 Fragment Header

   The IPv6 Fragment Header is inserted whenever the AERO tunnel ingress
   needs to apply fragmentation to accommodate packets no larger than
   1500 bytes.  Fragmentation is performed on the inner packet while
   encapsulating each inner packet fragment in identical outer IP and
   IPv6 Fragment Headers.  Fragmentation therefore follows the same
   procedure as for the case when a UDP header is included, which
   follows the same procedure as for standard IPv6 fragmentation.

   The IPv6 Fragment Header can also be inserted in order to include a
   coherent Identification value with each packet, e.g., to aid in
   Duplicate Packet Detection (DPD).  In this way, networking devices
   can cache the Identification values of recently-seen packets and use
   the cached values to determine whether a newly-arrived packet is in
   fact a duplicate.

   Finally, the Identification value within each packet could provide a
   rough indicator of packet reordering, e.g., in cases when the tunnel
   egress wishes to discard packets that are grossly out of order.

4.  Considerations for Using Minimal Encapsulation

   Minimal encapsulation is preferred in environments where UDP
   encapsulation would add unnecessary overhead.  For example, certain
   low-bandwidth wireless data links may benefit from an 8-byte-per-
   packet overhead reduction.  This is not likely to be a prime
   consideration for many modern wireless data links nor for most modern
   wired-line data links.

   UDP encapsulation can traverse network paths that are inaccessible to
   minimal encapsulation, e.g., for crossing Network Address Translators
   (NATs).  More and more, network middleboxes are also being configured
   to discard packets that include anything other than a well-known IP
   protocol such as UDP and TCP.  It may therefore be necessary to
   consider the potential for middlebox filtering before enabling
   minimal encapsulation in a given environment.

   Evidence seems to suggest that IPv6 fragmentation does not work along
   all paths, since well-meaning network middleboxes may consider it as
   an attack.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no IANA considerations.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are discussed in the base AERO specification
   [I-D.templin-aerolink].
