   o  Multiple implementations of Classic (non-SRv6 capable) P nodes
      were tested to validate that a transit node only needs to be IPv6
      capable.

4.3.  EANTC 2019

   In March 2019, the European Advanced Networking Test Center (EANTC)
   successfully validated multiple implementations of [RFC8754],
   [RFC8986], [I-D.ietf-bess-srv6-services], [draft-bashandy-isis-
   srv6-extensions], [draft-ietf-rtgwg-segment-routing-ti-lfa-01] and
   [draft-ietf-6man-spring-srv6-oam].  The Results from this event were
   showcased at the MPLS + SDN + NFV World Congress conference in April
   2019 [EANTC-19].

   Five different implementations of the SRv6 drafts, including
   [RFC8754] and [RFC8986] were used in this testing:

   o  Hardware implementation in Cisco NCS 5500 router.

   o  Hardware implementation in Huawei NE9000-8 router.

   o  Hardware implementation in Huawei NE40E-F1A router.

   o  Spirent TestCenter.

   o  Keysight Ixia IxNetwork.

   SRv6 interoperability, including processing as described in [RFC8754]
   and [RFC8986], was validated for the following scenarios:

   o  L3VPN for IPv4 traffic using the SRv6 H.Encaps and End.DT4
      behaviors.

   o  L3VPN for IPv6 traffic using the SRv6 H.Encaps and End.DT6
      behaviors.

   o  The testing validated the interoperability of H.Encaps and
      End.DT4/ End.DT6 behaviors combined with the End and End.X
      functions.

   o  SRH based Topology Independent (TI-LFA) Fast Reroute mechanisms
      using H.Insert.Red for link protection.

   o  OAM procedures (Ping and traceroute) [draft-ietf-6man-spring-

   the decapsulation (END.DT4/ END.DT6) functionality, simultaneously.
   Multiple implementations of Classic (non-SRv6 capable) P nodes were
   tested to validate that a transit node only needs to be IPv6 capable.

4.4.  SIGCOM 2017

   The following interoperability testing scenarios were publicly
   showcased on August 21-24, 2017 at the SIGCOMM conference.

   Five different implementations of SRv6 behaviors were used for this
   testing:

   o  Software implementation in Linux using the srext kernel module
      created by University of Rome, Tor Vergata, Italy.

   o  Software implementation in the FD.io Vector Packet Processor (VPP)
      virtual router.

   o  Hardware implementation in Barefoot Networks Tofino NPU using the
      P4 programming language.

   o  Hardware implementation in Cisco NCS 5500 router using
      commercially available NPU.

   o  Hardware implementation in Cisco ASR 1000 router using custom
      ASIC.

   SRH interoperability including processing as described in [RFC8754]
   and [RFC8986] was validated in the following scenarios:

   o  L3VPN using the SRv6 behaviors H.Encaps and End.DX6.

   o  L3VPN with traffic engineering in the underlay.  The testing
      validated the interoperability of H.Encaps and End.DX6 behaviors
      combined with the End and End.X functions.

   o  L3 VPN with traffic engineering and service chaining.  This
      scenario validated the L3 VPN service with underlay optimization
      and service programming using SRH.

   The results confirm consistency among SRH [RFC8754], network
   programming [RFC8986] and the dependent SRv6 drafts.

4.5.  EANTC 2018

   In March 2018, the European Advanced Networking Test Center (EANTC)
   successfully validated multiple implementations of [RFC8754] and

   [RFC8986].  The Results from this event were showcased at the MPLS +
   SDN + NFV World Congress conference in April 2018 [EANTC-18].

   Four different implementations of the SRv6 drafts, including
   [RFC8754] and [RFC8986] were used in this testing:

   o  Hardware implementation in Cisco NCS 5500 router.

   o  Hardware implementation in UTStarcom UAR500.

   o  Spirent TestCenter.

   o  Ixia IxNetwork.

   SRv6 interoperability, including processing as described in [RFC8754]
   and [RFC8986] was validated for the following scenarios:

   o  L3-VPN for IPv4 traffic using the SRv6 H.Encaps and End.DT4
      behaviors.

   o  L3VPN with traffic engineering in the underlay.  The testing
      validated the interoperability of H.Encaps and End.DT4 behaviors
      combined with the End and End.X functions.

   o  SRH based Topology Independent (TI-LFA) Fast Reroute mechanisms
      using H.Insert.Red.

   The results confirm consistency among SRH [RFC8754], network
   programming [RFC8986] and the dependent SRv6 drafts.

5.  Significant industry collaboration for SRv6 standardization

   The work on SRv6 started in IETF in 2013 and was later published in
   6man working group as [I-D.previdi-6man-segment-routing-header-00] in
   March 2014.  The first implementation was done in 2014 [WC-2015].

5.1.  Industry Collaboration for RFC8754

   A significant industry group of operators, academics and vendors
   supported and refined the initial submission [I-D.previdi-6man-
   segment-routing-header-00] according to the IETF process:

   o  Twenty-four revisions of the document were published.

   o  Over 1000 emails were exchanged.

   o  Over 16 IETF presentations were delivered.

Internet-Draft           SRv6 Deployment Status            February 2022


   o  Over 50 additional drafts were submitted to the IETF to specify
      SRv6 protocol extensions and use-cases [SRH-REF-BY].  These
      documents are either working group drafts or are well on their way
      to be adopted by their respective working group.  The work spans
      13 working group, including 6man, Spring, idr, bess, pce, lsr,
      detnet, dmm, mpls, etc.  Appendix A lists IETF contribution on
      SRv6.

   The outcome of this significant support from the operators and
   vendors led to the adoption of the draft by the 6man working group in
   December 2015.

   The first last call for the SRH document was issued in March 2018.

   A significant industry group of operators, academics and vendors
   supported and refined the idea according to the IETF process:

   o  63 tickets were closed.

   o  Hundreds of emails have been exchanged to support the closure.

   o  Sixteen revisions of the document have been published to reflect
      the work of the group and the closure of the tickets.

   After about 7 years of the above-mentioned collaboration from
   operators, academics and vendors led to the publication of RFC8754 in
   March 2020.

5.2.  Industry Collaboration for SRv6 Network Programming

   The same collaborative pattern is apparent as part of the
   standardization process SRv6 network programming [RFC8986].

   The work on SRv6 Network Programming draft started in March 2017.
   The initial version contained the SRv6 Endpoint behaviors with PSP
   and USP flavors, source SR node behaviors and illustrations.

   Since the inception of the idea of the SRv6 network programming, a
   large number of contributors, operators, vendors and academics
   supported and refined the document resulting in:

   o  22 revisions of the document were published.

   o  1360+ emails exchanged on SPRING (emails containing the draft
      name).

   o  About 66 additional drafts were submitted to the IETF that
      references network programming [NETPGM-REF-BY].  The work spans 12

      working group(spring, 6man, idr, bess, pce, rtg, lsr, detnet, dmm,
      lisp, teas, bier and more).

   The outcome of this significant support from the operators and
   vendors led to start of the Working Group last call on Dec 5, 2019.

   It resulted in 27 issues addressed through 10 new revisions of the
   draft (6-15):

   o  Rev6 (Dec 11th 2019): 594 lines changed (64.6%).

   o  Rev7 (Dec 19th 2019): 148 lines changed (16.1%).

   o  Rev8 (Jan 10th 2020): 24 lines changed (2.7%).

   o  Rev9 (Feb 7th 2020): 25 lines changed (2.7%).

   o  Rev10 (Feb 23rd 2020): 101 lines changed (11.0%).

   o  Rev11 (Mar 2nd 2020): 23 lines of editorial changes (2.5%).

   o  Rev12 (Mar 4th 2020): 3 lines of editorial changes (0.3%).

   o  Rev13 (Mar 9th 2020): 9 lines of editorial changes (1%).

   o  Rev14 (Mar 16th 2020): 11 lines of editorial changes (1%).

   o  Rev15 (Mar 27th 2020): 11 lines of editorial changes (1%).
