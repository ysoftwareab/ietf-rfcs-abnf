Abstract 
    
   It is highly desirable for Path Computation Clients (PCCs) to be 
   able to dynamically discover a set of Path Computation Elements 
   (PCEs) when PCCs/PCEs request a path computation to PCEs within an 
   AS and across ASs. In such a scenario, specifically BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs, 
   it is advantageous to use BGP to distribute PCE information. This

1. Introduction 
    
   [RFC4655] describes the motivations and architecture for a Path 
   Computation Element (PCE)-based path computation model for Multi 
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) / Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic 
   Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). In this model, path 
   computation requests are issued by a PCC to PCE that may be composite 
   or external. In case the PCC and PCE are not composite, a 
   request/response communication protocol is required to carry the 
   request and return the response. The requirements for such a 
   communication protocol are described in [RFC4657]. The communication 
   protocol between PCC and PCE, and between PCEs, is defined in [PCEP]. 
    
   In order for a PCC and PCE to communicate, the PCC must know the 
   location of the PCE. Also, in order for PCEs to communicate, the PCE 
   must know the location of another PCE as well. Actually, a number of 
   PCEs can be contained in BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs, where it is assumed that a 
   PCC will be CE and a PCE will be PE. Requirements for PCE in BGP/MPLS 
   IP-VPN [E2E-RSVP-TE] are described. In that sense, it is highly 
   desirable to have a mechanism for dynamic PCE discovery. Here, our 
   aim is to discover PCEs selectively and automatically in BGP/MPLS IP-
   VPNs. The point here is that all PCEs are not necessarily discovered 
   automatically and only specific PCEs that know VPN routes should be 
   discovered automatically. However, if a PCE discovers other PCEs by 
   IGP discovery [RFC5088] [RFC5089], the PCE establishes PCEP sessions 
   for discovered PCEs. In a BGP/MPLS IP-VPN, PCEs should not establish 
   full mesh PCEP sessions regardless of VPN routes. The disadvantage is 
   a scalability of PCE based on the number of PCEP sessions. Therefore, 
   in order to discover PCEs, BGP will be extended based on RFC4364 and 
   needs to carry PCE information. Specifically, a PCE address for a 
   VPNv4/VPNv6 tail-end address(es) (VPNv4/VPNv6 route(s)) is required.

               draft-kumaki-pce-bgp-disco-attribute-01      April 2008 
 
 
   Afterwards, PCEs discover the PCE address or some PCE addresses 
   automatically and establish PCEP session(s) for discovered PCE(s).  
    
   As described in [PCE-DISCO-BGP], PCE discovery information consists 
   of PCE location, PCE inter-domain functions, PCE domain visibility, 
   PCE destination domains and a set of general PCECP capabilities. The 
   PCE discovery information is described in [RFC5088] and [RFC5089], 
   and the same TLVs can be used for BGP. Therefore, in order to 
   establish a BGP session, a BGP speaker needs to have this capability. 
    
   However, if RRs are deployed in BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs, service providers 
   need to upgrade all RRs to recognize this capability. From the 
   service provider perspective, it is not desirable to upgrade all RRs 
   in order to add only one function (i.e., PCE function). Therefore, 
   BGP PCE discovery attribute is defined in this document. In this case, 
   needless to say, RRs are not required to upgrade and only PEs that 
   speaks PCE protocol are required to upgrade. 
    
   This document defines BGP PCE Discovery Attribute and describes how 
   PCE information can be carried in the Path Attributes of the UPDATE 
   message described in [RFC4271]. The BGP PCE discovery attribute is 
   defined in section 3 and BGP specific procedure is described in 
   section 4.

3. PCE Information 
 
   The PCE discovery information as described in [PCE-DISCO-BGP] 
   consists of PCE location, PCE inter-domain functions, PCE domain 
   visibility, PCE destination domains and a set of general PCECP 
   capabilities. The PCE discovery information is described in [RFC5088] 
   and [RFC5089], and the same TLVs can be used for BGP. 
    
   Here, the PCE discovery attribute for PCE in the Path Attributes of 
   BGP is defined.  
   
3.1  BGP PCE Discovery Attribute 
    
   The PCE information is carried in the Path Attributes of the UPDATE 
   message described in [RFC4271]. Here, the Transitive bit is defined 
   as non-transitive. However, it is a future work though the transitive 
   bit can be defined as 1 (transitive). 
 
   The Attribute Flags will be set as follows: 
    
   The Optional bit set to 1(optional). 
   The Transitive bit set to 0(non-transitive). 
   The Partial bit set to 0(complete). 
   The Extended Length bit set to 1(2 octets). 
    
   The Attribute Type will be set to some value. <TBD> 
    
   The Path Attributes will be encoded as < Length, List of TLV >. 
    
            +---------------------------+ 
            |   Length (2 octets)       | 
            +---------------------------+ 
            |   List of TLVs(variable)  | 
            +---------------------------+ 
    
   The meaning of the fields is described as follows: 
    
   a) Length : 
    
   The length in bytes of the list of TLVs carried in the Path Attribute. 
    
   b) List of TLVs : 
    
   This contains a list of TLVs each of which can be a PCE Discovery TLV. 
   The encoding of the PCE discovery TLV and its sub-TLVs will be the

               draft-kumaki-pce-bgp-disco-attribute-01      April 2008 
 
 
   same as that of the corresponding OSPF PCE TLVs described in 
   [RFC5088] and [RFC5089]. 
    
4. BGP Specific Procedure 
    
   The PCE Discovery Attribute can be carried in the Path Attribute of 
   BGP update messages. It can be handled regardless of IPv4/IPv6 and 
   VPNv4/VPNv6 routes in BGP update message. 
    
   Transmission processing: 
    
   BGP speakers advertise the PCE address with routes. The PCE address 
   is included in Path Attribute of BGP update message as BGP PCE 
   Discovery attribute. It can be configurable whether to advertise the 
   PCE address or not. 
    
   PCE address decision: 
    
   If a BGP speaker is PCE capable, the PCE address is the same as an 
   assigned address for BGP speaker itself. It may be a vrf interface 
   address or a loopback address. If a BGP speaker is not PCE capable, 
   it is decided by configuration or another method. This method is out 
   of scope of this document. 
    
   receiving processing: 
    
   BGP speakers that receive PCE Discovery Attributes register in their 
   RIB with routes. 
    
   procedure at path computation request: 
    
   This part describes an inner process within a router between BGP 
   process and path computation process. If the inquiry of a PCE address 
   is received from path computation process, the BGP process retrieve 
   the pertinent route of RIB, and returns the address of PCE Discovery 
   Attribute. Path computation process transmits path computation 
   request to this address. If this attribute is not in RIB, the BGP 
   process notify path computation process error. If two or more PCE 
   addresses of PCE Discovery Attribute exists, all the addresses are 
   returned to path computation process. 
    
5.  Security Considerations 
    
   This document defines BGP extensions for PCE discovery across an 
   administrative domain. Hence the security of the PCE discovery relies 
   on the security of BGP. 
    
   The security issues are described in the existing BGP. [RFC2385]

6.  IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA will assign BGP PCE Discovery Attribute type.
