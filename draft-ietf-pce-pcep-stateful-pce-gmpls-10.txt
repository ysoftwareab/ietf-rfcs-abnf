  Path Computation Element (PCE) Protocol Extensions for Stateful PCE
                   Usage in GMPLS-controlled Networks

                 draft-ietf-pce-pcep-stateful-pce-gmpls-10


Abstract

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) facilitates Traffic Engineering
   (TE) based path calculation in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or
   multi-layer networks. The PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) has been
   extended to support stateful PCE functions where the PCE retains
   information about the paths already present in the network, but
   those extensions are technology-agnostic. This memo provides
   extensions required for PCEP so as to enable the usage of a stateful
   PCE capability in GMPLS-controlled networks.

1. Introduction

   [RFC4655] presents the architecture of a Path Computation Element
   (PCE)-based model for computing Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched
   Paths (TE LSPs).  To perform such a constrained computation, a PCE
   stores the network topology (i.e., TE links and nodes) and resource
   information (i.e., TE attributes) in its TE Database (TED).  Such a
   PCE is usually referred as a stateless PCE. To request path
   computation services to a PCE, [RFC5440] defines the PCE
   communication Protocol (PCEP) for interaction between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE, or between two PCEs.  PCEP as
   specified in [RFC 5440] mainly focuses on MPLS networks and the PCEP
   extensions needed for GMPLS-controlled networks are provided in
   [PCEP-GMPLS].

   Stateful PCEs are shown to be helpful in many application scenarios,
   in both MPLS and GMPLS networks, as illustrated in [RFC8051].
   Further discussion of concept of a stateful PCE can be found in
   [RFC7399].  In order for these applications to able to exploit the
   capability of stateful PCEs, extensions to PCEP are required.

   [RFC8051] describes how a stateful PCE can be applicable to solve
   various problems for MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks and the benefits it
   brings to such deployments.

   [RFC8231] provides the fundamental extensions needed for stateful
   PCE to support general functionality, but leaves out the
   specification for technology-specific objects/TLVs. This document
   focuses on the extensions that are necessary in order for the
   deployment of stateful PCEs in GMPLS-controlled networks.

   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3. Context of Stateful PCE and PCEP for GMPLS

   This document is built on the basis of Stateful PCE [RFC8231] and
   PCEP for GMPLS [PCEP-GMPLS].

   There are two types of LSP operation for Stateful PCE.

   For Active Stateful PCE, PCUpd message is sent from PCE to PCC to
   update the LSP state for the LSP delegated to PCE. Any changes to
   the delegated LSPs generate a PCRpt message by the PCC to PCE to
   convey the changes of the LSP. Any modifications to the Objects/TLVs
   that are identified in this document to support GMPLS technology-
   specific attributes will be carried in the PCRpt and PCUpd messages.

   For Passive Stateful PCEs, PCReq/PCRep messages are used to convey
   path computation instructions.  GMPLS-technology specific Objects
   and TLVs are defined in [PCEP-GMPLS], so this document just points
   at that work and only adds the stateful PCE aspects where applicable.
   Passive Stateful PCE makes use of PCRpt messages when reporting LSP
   State changes sent by PCC to PCEs. Any modifications to the
   Objects/TLVs that are identified in this document to support GMPLS
   technology-specific attributes will be carried in the PCRpt message.

   [PCEP-GMPLS] defines GMPLS-technology specific Objects/TLVs and this
   document makes use of these Objects/TLVs without modifications where
   applicable. Some of these Objects/TLVs may require modifications to
   incorporate stateful PCE element where applicable.

4. Main Requirements

   This section notes the main functional requirements for PCEP
   extensions to support stateful PCE for use in GMPLS-controlled
   networks, based on the description in [RFC8051].  Many
   requirements are common across a variety of network types (e.g.,
   MPLS-TE networks and GMPLS networks) and the protocol extensions to
   meet the requirements are already described in [RFC8231].  This
   document does not repeat the description of those protocol
   extensions.  This document presents protocol extensions for a set of
   requirements which are specific to the use of a stateful PCE in a
   GMPLS-controlled network.

   The basic requirements are as follows:

  o  Advertisement of the stateful PCE capability.  This generic
     requirement is covered in Section 5.4. of [RFC8231].  This


Lee et al.              Expires September 2019                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Stateful PCEP for GMPLS               March 2019


     document assumes that STATEFUL-PCE-CAPABILITY TLV can be used for
     GMPLS Stateful PCE capability and therefore does not provide any
     further extensions.

  o  LSP delegation is already covered in Section 5.7. of [RFC8231].
     Section 2.2. of this document does not provide any further
     extensions.

   o  Active LSP update is covered in Section 6.2 of [RFC8231]. Section
      4.1. of this document provides extension for its application in
      GMPLS-controlled networks.

  o  LSP state synchronization and LSP state report. This is a generic
     requirement already covered in Section 5.6. of [RFC8231].  However,
     there are further extensions required specifically for GMPLS-
     controlled networks and discussed in Section 4.2.

5. PCEP Extensions

5.1. LSP Update in GMPLS-controlled Networks

   [RFC8231] defines the Path Computation LSP Update Request (PCUpd)
   message to enable to update the attributes of an LSP. However, that
   document does not define technology-specific parameters.

   A key element of the PCUpd message is the attribute-list construct
   defined in [RFC5440] and extended by many other PCEP specifications.

   For GMPLS purposes we note that the BANDWIDTH object used in the
   attribute-list is defined in [PCEP-GMPLS].  Furthermore, additional
   TLVs are defined for the LSPA object in [PCEP-GMPLS] and MAY be
   included to indicate technology-specific attributes. There are other
   technology-specific attributes that need to be conveyed in the
   <intended-attribute-list> of the <path> construct in the PCUpd
   message. Note that these path details in the PCUpd message are the
   same as the <attribute-list> of the PCRep message. See Section 4.2
   for the details.

5.2. LSP Synchronization in GMPLS-controlled Networks

   PCCs need to report the attributes of LSPs to the PCE to enable
   stateful operation of a GMPLS network.  This process is known as
   LSP state synchronization.  The LSP attributes include bandwidth,
   associated route, and protection information etc., are stored by the
   PCE in the LSP database (LSP-DB).  Note that, as described in
   [RFC8231], the LSP state synchronization covers both the bulk
   reporting of LSPs at initialization as well the reporting of new or
   modified LSP during normal operation. Incremental LSP-DB

Internet-Draft         Stateful PCEP for GMPLS               March 2019


   synchronization may be desired in a GMPLS-controlled network and it
   is specified in [RFC8232].

   [RFC8231] describes mechanisms for LSP synchronization using the
   Path Computation State Report (PCRpt) message, but does not cover
   reporting of technology-specific attributes. As stated in [RFC8231],
   the <path> construct is further composed of a compulsory Explicit
   Route Object (ERO) and a compulsory attribute-list and an optional
   Record Route Object (RRO). In order to report LSP states in GMPLS
   networks, this specification allows the use within a PCRpt message
   both of technology- and GMPLS-specific attribute objects and TLVs
   defined in [PCEP-GMPLS] as follows:

     o  Include Route Object (IRO)/ Exclude Route Object (XRO)
        Extensions to support the inclusion/exclusion of labels and
        label sub-objects for GMPLS. (See Section 2.6 and 2.7 in [PCEP-
        GMPLS])

     o  END-POINTS (Generalized END-POINTS Object Type. See Section 2.5
        in [PCEP-GMPLS])

     o  BANDWIDTH (Generalized BANDWIDTH Object Type. See Section 2.3
        in [PCEP-GMPLS])

     o  LSPA (PROTECTION ATTRIBUTE TLV, See Section 2.8 in [PCEP-GMPLS].

   The END-POINTS object SHOULD be carried within the attribute-list to
   specify the endpoints pertaining to the reported LSP. The XRO object
   MAY be carried to specify the network resources that the reported
   LSP avoids and a PCE SHOULD consider avoid these network resources
   during the process of re-optimizing after this LSP is delegated to
   the PCE.  To be more specific, the <attribute-list> is updated as
   follows using the notations of [RFC5511]:

   <attribute-list> ::= [<END-POINTS>]
                        [<LSPA>]
                        [<BANDWIDTH>]
                        [<metric-list>]
                        [<IRO>]
                        [<XRO>]

   <metric-list>::= <METRIC>[<metric-list>]


   If the LSP being reported protects another LSP, the PROTECTION-
   ATTRIBUTE TLV [PCEP-GMPLS] MUST be included in the LSPA object to

Internet-Draft         Stateful PCEP for GMPLS               March 2019


   describe its attributes and restrictions. Moreover, if the status of
   the protecting LSP changes from non-operational to operational, the
   PCC SHOULD synchronize the state change of the LSPs to the stateful
   PCE using a PCRpt message. This use case arises, for example, when
   the protecting LSP becomes operational due to the failure of the
   primary LSP.



5.3.  Modification of Existing PCEP Messages and Procedures

   One of the advantages mentioned in [RFC8051] is that the stateful
   nature of a PCE simplifies the information conveyed in PCEP messages,
   notably between PCC and PCE, since it is possible to refer to PCE
   managed state for active LSPs. To be more specific, with a stateful
   PCE, it is possible to refer to an LSP with a unique identifier in
   the scope of the PCC-PCE session and thus use such identifier to
   refer to that LSP. Note this is also applicable to packet networks.

5.3.1. Modification for LSP Re-optimization

   The Request Parameters (RP) object on a Path Computation Request
   (PCReq) message carries the R bit.  When set, this indicates that
   the PCC is requesting re-optimization of an existing LSP. Upon
   receiving such a PCReq, a stateful PCE SHOULD perform the    re-
   optimization in the following cases:

     o  The existing bandwidth and route information of the LSP to be
         re-optimized is provided in the PCReq message using the
         BANDWIDTH object and the ERO.

     o  The existing bandwidth and route information is not supplied
         in the PCReq message, but can be found in the PCE's LSP-DB.
         In this case, the LSP MUST be identified using an LSP
         identifier carried in the PCReq message, and that fact
         requires that the LSP identifier was previously supplied
         either by the PCC in a PCRpt message or by the PCE in a PCRep
         message.  [RFC8231] defines how this is achieved using a
         combination of the per-node LSP identifier (PLSP-ID) and the
         PCC's address.

   If no LSP state information is available to carry out re-
   optimization, the stateful PCE should report the error "LSP state
   information unavailable for the LSP re-optimization" (Error Type =
   TBD1, Error value= TBD2).

Internet-Draft         Stateful PCEP for GMPLS               March 2019


5.3.2. Modification for Route Exclusion

   [RFC5521] defines a mechanism for a PCC to request or demand that
   specific nodes, links, or other network resources are excluded from
   paths computed by a PCE.  A PCC may wish to request the computation
   of a path that avoids all link and nodes traversed by some other LSP.

   To this end this document defines a new sub-object for use with
   route exclusion defined in [RFC5521].  The LSP exclusion sub-object
   is as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |X|Type (TBD3) |     Length    |   Attributes  |    Flag        |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                                                               |
     //                    Symbolic Path Name                       //
     |                                                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


     X bit and Attribute fields are defined in [RFC5521].

     Type: Subobject Type for an LSP exclusion sub-object. Value of
     TBD3. To be assigned by IANA.

     Length: The Length contains the total length of the subobject in
     bytes, including the Type and Length fields.

     Flags: This field may be used to further specify the exclusion
     constraint with regard to the LSP. Currently, no values are
     defined.

     Symbolic Path Name: This is the identifier given to an LSP and is
     unique in the context of the PCC address as defined in [RFC8231].

     Reserved: MUST be transmitted as zero and SHOULD be ignored on
     receipt.

   This sub-object is OPTIONAL in the exclude route object (XRO) and
   can be present multiple times.  When a stateful PCE receives a PCReq
   message carrying this sub-object, it SHOULD search for the
   identified LSP in its LSP-DB and then exclude from the new path
   computation all resources used by the identified LSP.  If the
   stateful PCE cannot recognize one or more of the received LSP
   identifiers, it should send an error message PCErr reporting "The
   LSP state information for route exclusion purpose cannot be found"

   (Error-type = TBD1, Error-value = TBD4).  Optionally, it may provide
   with the unrecognized identifier information to the requesting PCC
   using the error reporting techniques described in [RFC5440].

5.3.3. Modification for SRP Object to indicate Bi-directional LSP

   The format of the SRP object is defined in [RFC8231].  The object is
   used in PCUpd and PCInit messages for GMPLS.

   This document defines a new flag to be carried in the Flags field of
   the SRP object.   This flag indicates a bidirectional co-routed LSP
   setup operation initiated by the PCE as follows:

     o  B (Bidirectional LSP -- 1 bit):  If set to 0, it indicates a
        request to create a uni-directional LSP.  If set to 1, it
        indicates a request to create a bidirectional co-routed LSP.

   The bit position is TBD5 as assigned by IANA (see Section 5.3)



5.4. Object Encoding

   Note that, as is stated in Section 7 of [RFC8231], the P flag and
   the I flag of the PCEP objects used on PCUpd and PCRpt messages
   SHOULD be set to 0 on transmission and SHOULD be ignored on receipt
   since these flags are exclusively related to path computation
   requests.

6. IANA Considerations

6.1. New PCEP Error Codes

   IANA is requested to make the following allocation in the "PCEP-
   ERROR Object Error Types and Values" registry.

   Error Type        Meaning                                Reference

   TBD1         LSP state information missing              [This.I-D]

   Error-value TBD2:    LSP state information unavailable  [This.I-D]

                    for the LSP re-optimization

   Error-value TBD4:   LSP state information for route

                   exclusion purpose cannot be found       [This.I-D]

Internet-Draft         Stateful PCEP for GMPLS               March 2019




6.2. New Subobject for the Exclude Route Object

   IANA maintains the "PCEP Parameters" registry containing a
   subregistry called "PCEP Objects".  This registry has a subregistry
   for the XRO (Exclude Route Object) listing the sub-objects that can
   be carried in the XRO.  IANA is requested to assign a further sub-
   object that can be carried in the XRO as follows:

      Value       Description                    Reference

   ----------+------------------------------+-------------

      TBD3        LSP identifier sub-object     [This.I-D]

6.3. New "B" Flag in the SRP Object

   IANA maintains a subregistry, named the "SRP Object Flag Field",
   within the "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers"
   registry, to manage the Flag field of the SRP object.

   IANA is requested to make an assignment from this registry as
   follows:

          Bit      Description                        Reference
          ---      ----------------------------       ----------

          TDB5     Bi-directional co-routed LSP       [This.I-D]


7. Manageability Considerations

   The description and functionality specifications presented related
   to stateful PCEs should also comply with the manageability
   specifications covered in Section 8 of [RFC4655]. Furthermore, a
   further list of manageability issues presented in [RFC8231] should
   also be considered.

   Additional considerations are presented in the next section.

7.1. Requirements on Other Protocols and Functional Components

   When the detailed route information is included for LSP state
   synchronization (either at the initial stage or during LSP state
   report process), this requires the ingress node of an LSP carry the
   RRO object in order to enable the collection of such information.

8. Security Considerations

   This draft provides additional extensions to PCEP so as to
   facilitate stateful PCE usage in GMPLS-controlled networks, on top
   of [RFC8231].  The PCEP extensions to support GMPLS-controlled
   networks should be considered under the same security as for MPLS
   networks, as noted in [RFC7025]. Therefore, the security
   considerations elaborated in [RFC5440] still apply to this draft.
   Furthermore, [RFC8231] provides a detailed analysis of the
   additional security issues incurred due to the new extensions and
   possible solutions needed to support for the new stateful PCE
   capabilities and they apply to this document as well.

9. Acknowledgement

   We would like to thank Adrian Farrel and Cyril Margaria for the
   useful comments and discussions.
