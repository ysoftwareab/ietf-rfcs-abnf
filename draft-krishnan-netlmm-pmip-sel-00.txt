Abstract

   Proxy MobileIPv6 describes a protocol solution for network based
   mobility management that relies on Mobile IPv6 signaling and reuse of
   home agent functionality.  This document describes a mechanism by
   which a mobile node in a PMIPv6 network can signal to the network
   whether it would like to make use of the Proxy Mobility service.

2.  Introduction

   Proxy MobileIPv6 [PMIPv6] describes a protocol solution for network
   based mobility management that relies on Mobile IPv6 signaling and
   reuse of home agent functionality.  A proxy mobility agent in the
   network which manages the mobility for a mobile node is the reason
   for referring to this protocol as Proxy Mobile IPv6.  This protocol
   is targeted mainly towards mobile nodes that are incapable or
   unwilling to do their own mobility signaling.  If a mobile node that
   wishes to do its own mobility signaling enters a PMIPv6 network it
   cannot do so since the PMIP domain makes the MN believe that it is in
   fact in its home network.  This document describes a mechanism by
   which a mobile node in a PMIPv6 network can signal to the PMIPv6
   network whether it would like to make use of the Proxy Mobility
   service or not.

3.  Mechanism

   According to [PMIPv6] the mobile node uses the Router Advertisements
   from the Access Router (which is the proxy mobility agent) to
   autoconfigure its address on the new link.  The PMA receives a Router
   Solicitation from the MN and responds with a Router Advertisement
   containing the MN's home prefix.  The proposed mechanism uses this
   Router Solicitation to signal to the PMA as to whether it requests
   the Proxy Mobility Service or not.  For this purpose, this document
   creates a new flag bit in the IPv6 Router Solicitation called the C
   bit.  A mobile node that utilises this mechanism and wants to perform
   its own signaling, MUST set the C bit to one.  The PMA that receives
   it SHOULD respond with a Router Advertisement containing a
   topologically correct prefix for the link (i.e.  Not the home
   prefix).

4.  Changes to Router Solicitation Message Format

   This document modifies the format of the Router Solicitation Message
   specified in [RFC2461] to look like the following

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Type      |     Code      |          Checksum             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |C|                          Reserved                           |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   Options ...
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
   ICMP Fields:

      Type           133

      Code           0

      Checksum       The ICMP checksum.  See [ICMPv6].

      C              If this bit is set, it means that the sending MN
                     would like to perform its own signaling.

      Reserved       This field is unused.  It MUST be initialized to
                     zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the
                     receiver.

5.  Backward Compatibility

   MNs which are not aware of this specification will not set the C bit
   and hence the PMA would provide them with proxy mobility service.
   PMAs not aware of this bit when a client sets the C bit to 1 will
   ignore it as specified in [RFC2461]

6.  Security Considerations

   The mechanism described in this document signals to the network
   infrastructure that the sending MN is capable of doing its own
   mobility signaling and does not wish to avail of the proxy mobility
   service.  If a node is incapable of doing so, an on-link attacker can
   send a spoofed router solicitation and deny proxy mobility service to
   the node.  The usage of SEND [RFC3971] would prevent this from
   happening.
