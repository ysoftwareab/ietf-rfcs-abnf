Abstract

   Prior to the publication of RFC2489 (which was updated by RFC2939),
   several option codes were assigned to proposed DHCP options that were
   subsequently never used. This document lists those unused option
   codes and directs IANA to make these option codes available for
   assignment to other DHCP options in the future.

   The document also lists several option codes that are not currently
   documented in an RFC but should not be made available for
   reassignment to future DHCP options.

1. Introduction

   Section 2 of this document lists the unused DHCP option codes from

   the IANA list of BOOTP and DHCP option codes [1].  Each option code
   includes any known documentation and contact information from the
   IANA list.  IANA will make these option codes available for
   assignment to other DHCP options in the future.

   Section 3 lists several DHCP option codes that are not currently
   documented in an RFC but should not be made available for
   reassignment to future DHCP options.

2. Unused DHCP Option Codes to be Reassigned to Future DHCP Options

   The option codes listed in this section are to be returned to IANA
   for reassignment to new options.  Responses from associated contact
   persons are noted where they have been received.

3. Option codes to be reserved by IANA

   The option codes listed in this section are the subject of ongoing
   work in the dhc working group.  These options codes should remain on
   the IANA list of assigned option codes [1] until the dhc working
   group has made a final decision about their disposition.

3.1 Option codes used in PXE Specification

   The following option codes are used in the "Preboot Execution
   Environment (PXE) Specification, Version 2.1" [4].  However, although
   these options are in widespread use by devices that use PXE, none of
   these option codes have been described in a published RFC.

   The dhc WG will endeavor to have specifications for these options
   published.

   Contact:           Dan Harrington, Michael Johnston


3.2 Option Code Extensions

   Note that these option codes are identified in "Extending DHCP
   Options Codes" [5] as part of a mechanism for extending the set of
   option codes available to DHCP.  If these option codes are not used
   for DHCP option code extension, they will be returned to IANA for
   reassignment to other DHCP options.

   Codes:             126, 127

   Name:              Option Code Extensions

4. Already Returned for Reassignment

   The option codes 99, 102-107, 109 and 111 have already been returned
   for reassignment to future DHCP options.

5. IANA Considerations

   When this document has been published as an Informational RFC, IANA
   will be requested to return the unused DHCP option codes to the list
   of available option codes. These option codes may be reassigned to
   new DHCP options, according to the procedures in RFC 2939 [6].
