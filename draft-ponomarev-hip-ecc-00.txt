1.  Introduction

   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key
   cryptography offering equivalent security with smaller key sizes than
   RSA or DSA [nist-key-management].  The smaller keys result in less
   computational costs and therefore better performance for HIP
   [RFC4423].  Its reduced power consumption is also important for
   mobile devices.

    Symmetric  |   ECC   |  DH/DSA/RSA
   ------------+---------+-------------
        80     |   160   |     1024
       112     |   224   |     2048
       128     |   256   |     3072
       192     |   384   |     7680
       256     |   512   |    15360

                  Table 1: Comparable Key Sizes (in bits)

   This document describes additions to HIP to support ECC, applicable
   to RFC5201 [RFC5201].  ECC keys may be used both as Host Identity to
   authenticate the hosts and in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange to
   generate a piece of keying material.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[RFC2119].

2.  Additions to Host Identity Protocol

2.1.  DIFFIE_HELLMAN

   The following additional Group IDs MAY be used:

   NAME (NIST)                      |   NAME (SECG)  | Value
   ---------------------------------+----------------+-------
   192-bit Random ECP Group         |    secp192r1   |  7
   224-bit Random ECP Group         |    secp224r1   |  8
   256-bit Random ECP Group         |    secp256r1   |  9
   384-bit Random ECP Group         |    secp384r1   | 10
   521-bit Random ECP Group         |    secp521r1   | 11

   The groups are defined in RFC 5114 [RFC5114].

2.2.  HOST_ID

   The following additional algorithm MAY be supported by the Host
   Identity Protocol Implementations

           Algorithms       Values
