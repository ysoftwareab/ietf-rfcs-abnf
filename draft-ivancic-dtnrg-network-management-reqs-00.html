Introduction</h3>

<p>The initial Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking has it origins in
      research performed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboritory to establish an
      Interplanetary Internet. Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) has
      been defined as an end-to-end store-and-forward architecture capable of
      providing communications in highly-stressed network environments
      considered unusual from the perspective of the terrestrial Internet. To
      provide the store-and-forward service, a "bundle" protocol sits at the
      application layer of some number of constituent internets, forming a
      store-and-forward overlay network <a class='info' href='#RFC4838'>[RFC4838]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cerf, V., Burleigh, S., Hooke, A., Torgerson, L., Durst, R., Scott, K., Fall, K., and H. Weiss, &ldquo;Delay-Tolerant Networking Architecture,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC5050'>[RFC5050]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Scott, K. and S. Burleigh, &ldquo;Bundle Protocol Specification,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. Key capabilities of the Bundle Protocol
      include: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Custody transfer the ability for a bundle node to take full
          responsibility for a bundle reaching its final destination.
</li>
<li>Ability for implementations to cope with intermittent
          connectivity if required.
</li>
<li>Ability for implementations to cope with long propagation delays
          if required.
</li>
<li>Ability to take advantage of scheduled, predicted, and
          opportunistic connectivity (in addition to continuous
          connectivity).
</li>
<li>Late binding of overlay network endpoint identifiers to internet
          addresses
</li>
</ul>

<p>DTN technologies are well-suited to applications that are mostly
      asynchronous and insensitive to large variations in delivery conditions.
      DTN networks differ sufficiently from traditional terrestrial networks
      in their characteristics and connectivityi. Network and
      transport protocols must be carefully considered and chosen to cope with
      these different characteristics. New transport protocols may be designed that
      are suited for the problems that these DTN network conditions
      impose.
</p>
<p>In a low-propagation-delay environment, such as may occur in
      near-planetary or terrestrial environments, bundle agents can utilize
      chatty underlying Internet transport protocols, such as TCP, that
      negotiate connectivity and handshake connections in real-time.
</p>
<p>In high-propagation-delay environments such as deep space, DTNRG
      bundle agents must use other methods, such as some form of scheduling,
      to set up connectivity between the two bundle agents.
</p>
<p>DTN runs the Bundle Protocol over subnet-specific transport
      protocols, called convergence layers. Each of these convergence layers
      may have widely varying characteristics which must be considered.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that DTN does not presume any particular
      underlying network. As such, DTN can be used to effectively perform a
      bridge between network types (i.e IP to Bluetooth or IP networks to
      Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) data-link
      connected space systems.)

DTN Senarios</h3>

<p>To gain a better understanding of Delay/Disruption Tolerent Networks
      the following section decribes various scenarios. These concepts of
      operations (CONOPS) will provide a framework from which network
      monitoring requirments are derived.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Deep Space Mars Relay</h3>

<p>The following is an example of the Mars Exploration Rover 
	Communications Operations taken from appendix A of a NASA 
	In-Space Routing Study <a class='info' href='#AC1L179'>[AC1L179]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cerf, V. and K. Scott, &ldquo;In-Space Routing Study,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. This
	example also provides some insight into current deep space
	communications operations.
</p>
<p>Mars Exploration Rovers use two primary means of
	communication: Direct-to/from-Earth (DTE/DFE)
	communications via X-band radio with both low gain and high
	gain antennas, and Relay operations using a UHF
	transceiver, fixed low gain omni-directional antenna, and a
	choice of two relay satellites.
</p>
<p>The original program requirement was to return 80 Mbits of
	data every 2 Sols (1 Sol = 1 Martian day), and the primary
	means of communication was to be the DTE/DFE link. The UHF
	relay concept had never been tried before on a Mars
	mission, and the MER UHF capability was viewed as a
	secondary experimental option for both data return and
	commanding.
</p>
<p>As the mission progressed, it was quickly recognized how
	versatile and robust the UHF relay operations were, and UHF
	operations quickly became the preferred means of data
	acquisition. (The first attempt to use the UHF link at 256
	kbps returned 110 Mbits of data in one sol, nearly triple
	the original program requirement. To date, the best relay
	pass was on MER B Sol 450 when 190.3 Mbits were received
	via the Odyssey relay.)
</p>
<p>To date, about 96% of the MER data has been returned using 
  	the UHF radio and the two relay satellites.
</p>
<p>ODYSSEY RELAY OPERATIONS
</p>
<p>The primary and preferred means of obtaining data from MER is
	the UHF relay through the Mars Odyssey satellite. Launched in 
	2001, Odyssey has a duplicate of the UHF radio flown on MER, 
	and full duplex operations are possible, using a reliable link 
	protocol, and at double the maximum data rate possible with MGS. 
	Approximately 88% of the MER data returned to date have been through
	Odyssey.

<p>Odyssey affords an average of 1.8 communication passes per Sol
	(assuming a 20 deg elevation mask to avoid multipath and
	line-of-site blockage), with an average data collection time
	per pass of about 6 minutes.
</p>
<p>The UHF radios in both MER and ODY use a 
	built-in CCSDS Proximity Link 1
	protocol, which automatically will manage the retransmission of
	missed or corrupted data frames. The normal use of the UHF relay is
	to transmit in Reliable Bit Stream Mode, sending DTE TM frames
	encapsulated in Prox-1 data units. 
</p>
<p>The basic operations cycle is that the 
	data are acquired from one of the
	three possible sources, along with a catalog of what MER thought it
	had sent, a data operations team compiles data from the various
	possible paths (DTE/DFE/relays through different DSN stations and
	different mission operations centers), and full and partial data
	products received are examined by a Data Management Team to
	determine what might be missing or corrupted. This is work that
	reliable protocols such as CFDP or DTN could be doing automatically
	in future missions.
</p>
<p>Once data is manually examined, the Data Management Team forwards
	retransmission requests  to the Operations team, along with a
	tabulation of what data products stored on MER have satisfactorily
	been received and which therefore may be erased from the rover's
	data storage.
</p>
<p>The Operations team then crafts the 
	commands to request retransmission
	during a future pass, and eventually radiated to MER in either an
	X-band DFE pass or via the Odyssey relay spacecraft. The DTE/DFE
	command sequences have to be crafted by one team and reviewed by
	another prior to radiation to the spacecraft by a third team. In
	the case of retransmit commands to be relayed through Odyssey to
	the rover, a fourth ODY spacecraft team has to review the command
	load and get the commands uplinked to ODY. Much of this manual work
	would be eliminated by well-engineered end-to-end use of CFDP
	and/or DTN. 
</p>
<p>The location of received data has to be 
	tracked down sometimes, as when
	files come in to a ground DSN station or a relay spacecraft GDS and
	for whatever reason fail to be forwarded to the MER GDS. Often this
	requires manual searches of directories and a little detective
	work. Automated routing protocols would alleviate this
	situation.
</p>
<p>One of the tasks of the data operations 
	team is to determine WHERE the
	data gaps occurred; sometimes the data are missing or corrupted
	during the UHF relay, sometimes the relay satellite link to earth
	is the source of the gap. Where the data has gone missing is a
	factor in subsequent mission planning and commanding. With the
	current implementation of the system, the relay satellites do not
	store the data for retransmission, so data gaps must be filled by
	the rover on a subsequent pass. CFDP with store and forward and
	custody transfer would alleviate much of this manual work.
</p>
<p>In addition to the business of manually
	examining what data the rover
	thought it sent and comparing to what had been received (after
	finding it all from the 3 possible paths), each and every radio
	link has to be commanded in terms of data rates, pass durations and
	paths. For example, during any one day, MER would have the
	opportunity to pass critical data via 2 relay paths or one DTE
	path. These routing decisions are made by the Operations team every
	day.
</p>
<p>OPERATIONS COMPARISON WITH CFDP
</p>
<p>The MER mission was been a great success and  proved the viability 
	of UHF Relay and Store and Forward operations. The utility and
	reliability of this method of communications is so great that the 
	Phoenix mission (a Mars lander) is a UHF-only mission; all data 
	and commands to Phoenix are via a relay satellite and a UHF proximity 
	link radio.
</p>
<p>The current process has various inefficiencies 
	that can be improved upon
	in future missions. The use of common end-to-end protocol stacks
	will reduce some header overhead by eliminating the need for frame
	encapsulation, and the whole manual process of having to hunt for
	data, and having to use custom software to merge multiple sources,
	evaluate missing data and create replay commands can be replaced
	with the use of standardized protocols such as DTN which can
	automate the process of recovering missing data. The option of
	using DTN in unacknowledged mode will allow ground team control of
	retransmissions when power considerations might make automatic
	retransmissions inadvisable.
</p>
<p>The original X-band design of the MER mission, 
	and the power-saving
	operations concept of severely limiting the use of the deep space
	transmitter on MER meant that bidirectional communications was
	difficult, and it may have been impractical to rely on a protocol
	where transactions need to be acknowledged within the time of a
	pass; the operational limit of the X-band transmitter was just
	about one round-trip light time to Earth, so that any NAKs
	generated automatically by a protocol at the DSN could not be acted
	upon during that transmission session. Subsequent communications
	opportunities would next come up via the relay satellites, or
	possibly at another DSN station, and none of those entities would
	have any knowledge of the transaction the NAK response would
	pertain to.
</p>
<p>The MER uplink strategy used a very compressed and uplink-efficient
	method of requesting retransmissions and file deletions. One
	comparison from a study that looked at a particular day of
	operations showed that the MER commands for retransmission/deletion
	took 4254 bytes, whereas if CFDP was used to automate, the traffic
	would be 22498 bytes. (This was on Sol-73, MER-A, where there were
	1066 file deletions and 66 file retransmissions required.) 
</p>
<p>The difference is due to the fact that CFDP deals with each file
	separately without the "shorthand" used by MER (which can delete
	ranges of files in one step). The trade is that CFDP automates the
	process, whereas with the MER process, a Data Management team has
	to manually determine what is missing and what data seta are
	complete and therefore can be deleted from on-board storage.
	Essentially, the MER process was designed to minimize uplink
	requirements, whereas CFDP is designed to allow for automated and
	rapid release of file storage space onboard.   Note
	CFDP is a predecessor to the DTN bundle protocol. DTN with security
	would likely increase these overhead numbers relative to CFDP.

Simple Sensor Networks</h3>

<p>Simple sensor networks consisting of low-power devices are likely
	to either run with extremely reduced DTN capabilities or
	utilize a sensor network to DTN proxiy.  The latter is more
	likely as low-power sensors with limited processing
	capabilities or radio transmission range are not
	likely to have much onboard storage or be synchronize, 
	capable of routing, name resolution, or running the DTN security 
	protocol.
</p>
<p>There may be cases where simple sensor networks are asleep often, 
	but synchronized to the extent that they can wake up a nearly the same 
	time to communicate some information.  These simple nodes would 
	probably have limited network management capability.  How DTN bundle
	agent discovery and routing is performed in such networks is to be
	determined.
</p>

Rapid Disruption</h3>

<p>Many wireless networks - particularly military  wireless networs
	are episodicalty connected because of terrain, foiliage,
	weather, and jamming.  Furthermore, radio signal power fades can
	cause rapid very-short periods of disconnection.  All of these 
	instances may result short periods of disruption as well as rapid 
	changes in topology.
</p>
<p>Applications that use the transmission control protocol (TCP) may
	perform very poorly in such environments due to TCP's
	congestion control algorithms - even in a non-congested
	environment.  Furthermore, any use DNS is problematic in a
	disrupted network as one is likely to be unable to reach the
	DNS server.  Caching DNS locally is one possible solution.
</p>
<p>DTN provides some potential solutions for such networks.  DTN
	routing may be capable of moving messages towards destination
	via store and forward if the proper naming structures and
	routing algorithms can be developed.  Late Binding does not
	require DNS lookups, but still requires localized name-to-address
	resolution which is somewhat analogous to a cached DNS.
</p>
<p>DTN routing (or any type of routing) in a rapidly changing
	topology is problematic and can result in very poor
	performance over wireless technologies as there is a
	potential to have the routing algorithms self-congest the
	wireless links and still not be able to converge properly.
</p>
<p>In tactical edge military networks there may be a mix of IP and
	non-IP radios.  DTN Bundling, as a network overlay, provides
	a means to bridge IP networks and non-IP data-links together.

<p>Low Earth Orbit (LEO) is a low-propagation-delay environment of

	Thus, the more ground system that are available,

<p>NASA's Advanced Tracking and Data Relay
	Satellites (TDRS) are bent pipe relays.  They have no onboard
	processing or storage.  Only RF energy is relayed between
	ground and 
	lower oribiting spacecraft such as the International Space
	Station.  The relay satellite performs the tracking function
	to keep the LEO system in site as long a possible or for some
	predefine time period.  The TDRS system is a highly scheduled
	system.  Thus DTN for TDRS is as much a function of disruption
	due to scheduling of limited resources than disruption due to
	the inability to physically make a connection.
</p>
<p>KU-band Geostationary satellites are another form of bent pipe
	relay.  In the scenario described, a KU-band GEO satellite 
	provides the RF
	connectivity between the satellite ground station and an
	unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Unlike the TDRS case,here, the antenna
	system onboard the moving UAV tracks the GEO satellite. The GEO
	satellite performs no tracking function.  
</p>
<p>As in the case of the LEO sensor satellite, 
	the space/ground link is a private
	link that is congestion free.  
	Communication may be more symmetric than for the
	LEO sensor satellite.  In fact, for systems which utilize
	commercial Ku-band GEO satellites, the link to the aircraft is
	likely to of a higher data rate than the link from the
	aircraft. This is due to regulatory issues regarding mobile systems at
	KU-band frequencies. Regardless, the desire is to fully utilizes
	the RF link when it becomes availabe. In order to obtain maximum
	performance, transport protocols that operate well in this
	enviroment are required .
</p>
<p>As in the LEO sensor satellite case, the ground/ground link

	a dramatically reduced bandwidth - perhaps only enough to send
	meta-data down.  The return flight is over the Pacific Ocean along
	the Korean and Japanese coastal areas.  At this time, Ku-Band
	connectivity is again available, but through a different satellite
	and to a different ground station located somewhere in Japan.
	Thus, we have a multihomed store-and-forward system with vastly
	different link capacities between the Ku-Band satellite service and
	the Ka-Band Iridium Low Earth Orbiting satellite constellation service.

General Requirements</h3>

<p>DTN is in its infancy.  Understanding what is useful to
	   monitor and what is necessary to configure is currently
	   unknow with the exception of some basic bundling
	   characteristics.  DTN networks can be viewed as
	   both ad hoc in nature as well as having an added complexity
	   due to varying degrees of delay and/or disruption and/or
	   disconnection. In addition, DTN networks will likely consist
	   of connecte systems with with wide-bandwidth, low-delay links
	   and disconnected systems with low-bandwidth, noisy, and
	   perhaps long-delay links, Thus DTN network management will be much more
	   complex than managing a connected system.
</p>
<p>The notion that one may be disconnected for long periods of time
	   make network management, performance measurement and remote 
	   configuration an extremely interesting an difficult problem. 
	   Performance information may be stale. State information such
	   as available storage capacity may be stale.  In addition,
	   remote configuration is quite problematic as one may lock
	   themselves out of a system.  Thus remote validation and 
	   graceful way to recover need to be developed.
</p>
<p>A DTN Network Managment system MUST be capable of both Local and
	   Remote  Network Management.  The Network Managment system
	   MUST be capable of monitoring bundle processing and system 
	   characteristics such as: Convergence Layers, Multi-Homing,
	   Radios parameters, Processing Power, and Onboard Storage. A
	   DTN Network Managment systems MUST be capable of configuring
	   routing, local name resolution caches, local time, security
	   and security policy configurations and any convergence layer
	   and radio parameters necessary to operate the system.
</p>
<p>The goal of the Management and Configuration is that it should work 
	   for all DTN environments 
	   including systems with high-delay, long periods of
	   disconnection and  low-bandwidth.  System may be multiple
	   hops away and never reachable in a single hop.  In addition,
	   system may not be synchronized (although current bundling RFC 5050 assumes 
	   synchronization). 
</p>
<p>It is understood that there may be extreme cases where due to long
	  propogation delays, limited processing power and memory, and
	  extremely limited bandwidth, that standard DTN network
	  management techniques are not use and that a custom
	  implementation will be required. 
</p>
<p>Remote Configuration MUST be Incremental and Include Test and
	  Validation.  In addition, there MUST be a mechanism for the
	  DTN node to recovery to the last know good state.  The
	  rational here is that one cannot access this sytem locally and
	  is likely to misconfigure some parameter and get locked out of
	  the DTN node and perhaps render the DTN node non-functional.
	  Thus the DTN node must have some autonomous capability to
	  sense it is non-functional and attemp to restore itself to
	  some last known good state.  Incrementally appling
	  configuration changes with some test and validation will help
	  to aliviate misconfigurations or indentify them at the
	  earliest state possible.

</p>
<p>Local Network Management will likely be performed prior to
		deploying a DTN node, at least for initial default
		configurations.
</p>
<p>The network administrator may be physically colocated with
	the DTN agent and capable of direct login via a consule
	port. One example may be a milatary personnel onboard an
	aircraft that contains a DTN forwarding agent.  Other DTN 
	systems may be part of a DTN network overlay,
	but reside on a network that is alway connected.  An example of
	this is a ground station for a Deep Space Network.  That ground station
	is always connected to the Internet via wide bandwidth links.
	Neither of these situations require operation over disconnected
	links.
</p>
<p> Early testbed configurations are likely to emulate
	disconnections and long delays while incorporating
	real-time back channels for monitoring and
	configuration.

<p>It may be desirable for a UDP CL to send "keep-alive" packets during

Licklider Transport Protocol</h3>

<p> The Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP), is designed to
	   provide retransmission-based reliability over links 
	   characterized by extremely long message round-trip times (RTTs) 
	   and/or frequent interruptions in connectivity. LTP is 
	   principally aimed at supporting "long-haul" reliable transmission

</p>
<p>LTP is a complex protocol and is required to maintain numerous
	   amounts of state information in order to be able to perform in the
	   environment it was designed for.  In order to manage a DTN
	   network that utilizes LTP, maintaining measurements of the state
	   parameters in Section 3, Session Management Segement, Section 4,
	   Requests from the Client Service and Section 6, 
	   Internal Procedures of the LTP Protocol is desirable.

DARPA Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) Radio</h3>

<p>The United States Defense Advanced Research Program Agency
  	(DARPA)is sponsoring development of a congnitive radio
	that is capable of finding available spectrum and is
	cabable of operatin over multiple channels.  DTN is
	expected to be a main component of this system and will
	be used for secure content storage and distribution with
	multi-tier security for content search. 
</p>
<p> At this time, the author is uncertain if the radio will
	operate on multiple simultaneous available links or just
	operate over multiple channels.  In one case, there are two or
	more physical interfaces from which bundles can be transmitted
	or recieve.  In the other, that may not be the case.  However,
	if one is bouncing between multiple channels and each channel
	has its own physical address, that could be considered a
	multi-homed radio system.

Deep Space / Proximity</h3>

<p>A system such as a space relay may be multi-homed -
	paricularly if one of the RF links is between
	Earth and the Relay and the second is between
	the relay and a terrestial over.  In such an
	example, the radios and antenna systems and
	associated transmission characteristics for
	proximity communications will be vastly
	differnet than the characteristics for the
	long-haul deep-space commnuications.  Note, the
	links may not be active at the same time due to
	orbital dynamics or simple for power resource
	scheduling.

Radios</h3>

<p>Many, if not most DTN agents will be mobile and connect to
	the DTN network via radio systems.  As such, those radio
	systems SHOULD expose critical configuration and
	performance parameters to the network management
	system.  This capability is often built into current
	radio systems via vendor defined MIBS, or, for radio
	systems that have vast deployement by multiple vendors,
	industy defined MIBS. 
</p>
<p>Radios can be Fixed-Rate or Bandwidth-On-Demand (BOD) radios.
      Fixed-rate radios implies that the rate is set prior to or at the
      beginning of communication and remains that way through the
      duration of communications.  BOD implies that the communicaiton
      rate may very throughout the transimssion duration.
</p>
<p>It is expected that specific parameters will be extremely
      useful to monitor in order to troubleshoot systems as well
      as accertain performance.  In addition, there are likely
      to be specific radio configuration parameters.
      Unfortunately, for the forseeable future, many of these
      are likely to be implementation specific.

Processing Power</h3>

<p>Whereas on may DTN devices, resources may be limited, it is
	likely to be useful to monitor and record processing
	power.  Such information may be used for future desing
	or to determine what bundles can be transmitted over
	what radio system.  One may hold onto a bundle or change
	the  routing weights based on the amount of power
	available for use by the entire system (i.e
	transmission power).

Onboard Storage</h3>

<p>DTN is a store and forward technology.  One of the DTN bundle
	forwarding agents main functions will be storage and management
        of bundles.  Thus, it will be important to monitor this storage usage
        including total amount of storage and how that storage may be
	partitioned.  For example, one may have policies in place that
	limit the amount of storage particular sources or groups may
	use. Exceeding configured limits may result in bundles being
	denied or dropped.  The ability to obtain information regading
	such denials or drops is expected to greatly aid in trouble
	shooting systems and configuration management.

Routing</h3>

	endpoints.  The Route Tables MUST be exposed to the network
	managment system The routing configuration parameters and all
	default and static routes MUST be expose to the network
	management system.
</p>
<p>A DTN routing agent (a system that act as an intermediary and
	can both send and recieve bundles) MUST be capable of default and
	static routing.  A bundle routing agent SHOULD be
	capable of some dynamic routing capability.  There are
	cases were bundle agent is and end system and does not act as an
	intermediary (i.e. simple sensor webs, space-based sensor
	platforms). In such cases, default routes or static routing MAY
	be sufficient.

Name Resolution</h3>

<p>Since DTN systems are name-base, not address-base, it will be
	important to monitor what the DTN router precives as the current
	name-to-next-hop address (name resolution).  The ability to
	monitor and correlate this information to the precived state of
	the overall DTN network will be critical for trouble shooting
	DTN network operation.  Thus, the DTN bundle agent MUST be
	provide the ability to monitor and
	configure the local cached name resolution system.  In addition,
        reports that include the name resolution database should include
	a timestamp indicated what the DTN agent beleive is its current time.
	This can be used to correlate the state of this particular DTN
	agent with other DTN agents in the network.

	RFC5050.  It will be extermely useful to expose what the bundle

Security</h3>

	Furthermore, misconfigured security can be extemely
	diffucult to track down because one

Multi-layer Security</h3>

<p>Most DTN routing agents will likely implement mult-layer
	security.  A system SHOULD have different layers of
	security for monitoring versus configuration.  A system
	may also have different layers of security for
	monitoring different properties of the DTN node.  For
	example, one may wish to allow most users to monitor
	bundle and radio performance, but may require higher
	levels of security to monitor security configurations.
	This is likely to also be the case for configuration.
	Configuration SHOULD require higher security credentials
	than monitoring.

	date, DTN firewalls have not been implemented.  This is
	likely to change if DTN becomes common place and

	exposing the firewall rules to the network managment
	system for monitoring and configuration.  This exposure
	SHOULD require appripriate security credentials.

Network Management Utilities</h3>

<p> In order to perform the most simple of network management
		functions and network troubleshooting, a set of tools is
		needed.  Some of these tools are listed below.
		</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>DTN-ping:  An echo request and reply using
			bundles.
</p>
<p>DTN-send/receive:  An application the sends and
			recieves bundles.
</p>
<p>DTN-traceroute:  An application that can provide
			information on how a bundle move through the
			system from source to destination and back. It
			is not obvious has to how one may wish to do
			this in a DTN.
</p>
<p>DTN-perf:  An applicaiton that provides performance
			measurements between a source and destination
			similar to IPerf for Interent Protocol
			networks.
</p>
<p>DTN-heartbeat: An application that sends a periodic
			status to some monitoring node in order to know
			all is well and the node is still alive. This
			application should not use much bandwidth and
			should have a configurable heart rate.
</p>
<p>DTN-email: A DTN mail application.
</p>
<p>DTN-chat:  A DTN chat application that would be
			useful for troubleshooting systems.  A
			conference capability would be useful.
</p>
<p>Bundle Count / Traffic Measurement:  A simple
			application that provide the very basics of
			network monitoring.  Something the help the DTN
			community get started with monitoring before a
			full network management applicaiton is
			developed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many  of these tools exist in various forms today for DTN.
	However, they currently are not interoperable between various
	implementations of DTN such and DTN-2 and ION.
</p>
<p>It is apparent that one of the first items that should be
		accomplished in order to obtain interoperability for
		the tool sets listed above as well as for network
		management applications will be a DTN application
		interface, a standard DTN API.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p> Security is likely to play a major role in many DTN deployments.
	Since DTN is a network overlay, in order to understand why
	something may not be working as expected one will have to
	understand not only what is happening at the DTN layer, but
	also at the lower layers.  Security at any of these layers is
	likely to render the system inoperable to some degree.  Thus,
	it is desirable to communicate various security settings to the
	network management system.  This, however, becomes a security
	issue and protecting such information and who can obtain access
	to such information is critical.
