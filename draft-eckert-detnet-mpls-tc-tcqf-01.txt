   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) Data Plane - MPLS TC Tagging for
              Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (MPLS-TC TCQF)
                  draft-eckert-detnet-mpls-tc-tcqf-01

Abstract

   This memo defines the use of the MPLS TC field of MPLS Label Stack
   Entries (LSE) to support cycle tagging of packets for Multiple Buffer
   Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (TCQF).  TCQF is a mechanism to support
   bounded latency forwarding in DetNet network.

   Target benefits of TCQF include low end-to-end jitter, ease of high-
   speed hardware implementation, optional ability to support large
   number of flow in large networks via DiffServ style aggregation by
   applying TCQF to the DetNet aggregate instead of each DetNet flow
   individually, and support of wide-area DetNet networks with arbitrary
   link latencies and latency variations.

1.  Introduction (informative)

   Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding [CQF], is an IEEE standardized queuing
   mechanism in support of deterministic bounded latency.  See also
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-bounded-latency], Section 6.6.

   CQF benefits for Deterministic QoS include the tightly bounded jitter
   it provides as well as the per-flow stateless operation, minimizing
   the complexity of high-speed hardware implementations and allowing to
   support on transit hops arbitrary number of DetNet flow in the
   forwarding plane because of the absence of per-hop, per-flow QoS
   processing.  In the terms of the IETF QoS architecture, CQF can be
   called DiffServ QoS technology, operating only on a traffic
   aggregate.

   CQFs is limited to only limited-scale wide-area network deployments
   because it cannot take the propagation latency of links into account,
   nor potential variations thereof.  It also requires very high
   precision clock synchronization, which is uncommon in wide-area
   network equipment beyond mobile network fronthaul.  See
   [I-D.eckert-detnet-bounded-latency-problems] for more details.

   This specification introduces and utilizes an enhanced form of CQF
   where packets are tagged with a cycle identifier, and a limited
   number of cycles, e.g.: 3...7 are used to overcome these distance and
   clock synchronization limitations.  Because this memo defines how to
   use the TC field of MPLS LSE as the tag to carry the cycle
   identifier, it calls this scheme TC Tagged multiple buffer CQF (TC
   TCQF).  See [I-D.qiang-DetNet-large-scale-DetNet] and
   [I-D.dang-queuing-with-multiple-cyclic-buffers] for more details of
   the theory of operations of TCQF.  Note that TCQF is not necessarily
   limited to deterministic operations but could also be used in
   conjunction with congestion controlled traffic, but those
   considerations are outside the scope of this memo.

   TCQF is likely especially beneficial when MPLS networks are designed
   to avoid per-hop, per-flow state even for traffic steering, which is
   the case for networks using SR-MPLS [RFC8402] for traffic steering of
   MPLS unicast traffic and/or BIER-TE [I-D.ietf-bier-te-arch] for tree
   engineering of MPLS multicast traffic.  In these networks, it is
   specifically undesirable to require per-flow signaling to P-LSR
   solely for DetNet QoS because such per-flow state is unnecessary for
   traffic steering and would only be required for the bounded latency
   QoS mechanism and require likely even more complex hardware and
   manageability support than what was previously required for per-hop
   steering state (e.g.  In RSVP-TE).  Note that the DetNet architecture
   [RFC8655] does not include full support for this DiffServ model,
   which is why this memo describes how to use MPLS TC TCQF with the
   DetNet architecture per-hop, per-flow processing as well as without
   it.

2.  Using TCQF in the DetNet Archticture and MPLS forwarding plane
    (informative)

   This section gives an overview of how the operations of T-CQF relates
   to the DetNet architecture.  We first revisit QoS with DetNet in the
   absence of T-CQF.

                     Figure 1: A DetNet MPLS Network

   The above Figure 1, is copied from [RFC8964], Figure 2, and only
   enhanced by numbering the nodes to be able to better refer to them in
   the following text.

   Assume a DetNet flow is sent from T-PE1 to T-PE2 across S-PE1, LSR,
   S-PE2.  In general, bounded latency QoS processing is then required
   on the outgoing interface of T-PE1 towards S-PE1, and any further
   outgoing interface along the path.  When T-PE1 and S-PE2 know that
   their next-hop is a service LSR, their DetNet flow label stack may
   simply have the DetNet flows Service Label (S-Label) as its Top of
   Stack (ToS) LSE, explicitly indicating one DetNet flow.

   On S-PE1, the next-hop LSR is not DetNet aware, which is why S-PE1
   would need to send a label stack where the S-Label is followed by a
   Forwarding Label (F-Label), and LSR-P would need to perform bounded
   latency based QoS on that F-Label.

   For bounded latency QoS mechanisms relying on per-flow regulator
   state, such as in [TSN-ATS], this requires the use of a per-detnet
   flow F-Label across the network from S-PE1 to S-PE2, for example
   through RSVP-TE [RFC3209] enhanced as necessary with QoS parameters
   matching the underlying bounded latency mechanism (such as
   [TSN-ATS]).

   With TC TCQF, a sequence of LSR and DetNet service node implements TC
   TCQF, ideally from T-PE1 (ingress) to T-PE2 (egress).  The ingress
   node needs to perform per-DetNet-flow per-packet "shaping" to assign
   each packet of a flow to a particular TCQF cycle.  This ingress-edge-
   function is currently out of scope of this document (TBD), but would
   be based on the same type of edge function as used in CQF.

   All LSR/Service node after the ingress node only have to map a
   received TCQF tagged DetNet packet to the configured cycle on the
   output interface, not requiring any per-DetNet-flow QoS state.  These
   LSR/Service nodes do therefore also not require per-flow interactions
   with the controller plane for the purpose of bounded latency.

   Per-flow state therefore is therefore only required on nodes that are
   DetNet service nodes, or when explicit, per-DetNet flow steering
   state is desired, instead of ingress steering through e.g.: SR-MPLS.

   Operating TCQF per-flow stateless across a service node, such as
   S-PE1, S-PE2 in the picture is only an option.  It is of course
   equally feasible to Have one TCQF domain from T-PE1 to S-PE2, start a
   new TCQF domain there, running for example up to S-PE2 and start
   another one to T-PE2.

   A service node must act as an egress/ingress edge of a TCQF domain if
   it needs to perform operations that do change the timing of packets
   other than the type of latency that can be considered in
   configuration of TCQF (see Section 5.1).

   For example, if T-PE1 is ingress for a TCQF domain, and T-PE2 is the
   egress, S-PE1 could perform the DetNet Packet Replication Function
   (PRF) without having to be a TQCF edge node as long as it does not
   introduce latencies not included in the TCQF setup and the controller
   plane reserves resources for the multitude of flows created by the
   replication taking the allocation of resources in the TCQF cycles
   into account.

   Likewise, S-PE2 could perform the Packet Elimination Function without
   being a TCQF edge node as this most likely does not introduce any
   non-TCQF acceptable latency - and the controller plane accordingly
   reserves only for one flow the resources on the S-PE2->T-PE2 leg.

   If on the other hand, S-PE2 was to perform the Packet Reordering
   Function (PRF), this could create large peaks of packets when out-of-
   order packets are released together.  A PRF would either have to take
   care of shaping out those bursts for the traffic of a flow to again
   conform to the admitted CIR/PIR, or else the service node would have
   to be a TCQF egress/ingress, performing that shaping itself as an
   ingress function.

3.2.  Packet processing

   This section explains the MPLS T-CQF packet processing and through
   it, introduces the semantic of the objects in Figure 2

   tcqf contains the router/LSR wide configuration of TCQF parameters,
   independent of the specific tagging mechanism on any interface.  Any
   interface can have a different tagging method.

   The model represents a single TQCF domain, which is a set of
   interfaces acting both as ingress (iif) and egress (oif) interfaces,
   capable to forward TCQF packets amongst each other.  A router/LSR may
   have multiple TCQF domains each with a set of interfaces disjoint
   from those of any other TCQF domain.

   tcqf.cycles is the number of cycles used across all interfaces in the
   TCQF domain. router/LSR MUST support 3 and 4 cycles.  To support
   interfaces with MPLS TC tagging, 7 or less cycles MUST be used across
   all interfaces in the CQF domain.

   The unit of tcqf.cycle_time is micro-seconds. router/LSR MUST support
   configuration of cycle-times of 20,50,100,200,500,1000,2000 usec.

   Cycles start at an offset of tcqf.cycle_clock_offset in units of nsec
   as follows.  Let clock1 be a timestamp of the local reference clock
   for TCQF, at which cycle 1 starts, then:

   tcqf.cycle_clock_offset = (clock1 mod (tcqf.cycle_time * tcqf.cycles)
   )

Internet-Draft             detnet-mpls-tc-tcqf              October 2021


   The local reference clock of the LSR/router is expected to be
   synchronized with the neighboring LSR/router in TCQF domain.
   tcqf.cycle_clock_offset can be configurable by the operator, or it
   can be read-only.  In either case will the operator be able to
   configure working TCQF forwarding through appropriately calculated
   cycle mapping.

   tcqf.if_config[oif] is optional per-interface configuration of TCQF
   parameters. tcqf.if_config[oif].cycle_clock_offset may be different
   from tcqf.cycle_clock_offset, for example, when interfaces are on
   line cards with independently synchronized clocks, or when non-
   uniform ingress-to-egress propagation latency over a complex router/
   LSR fabric makes it beneficial to allow per-egress interface or line
   card configuration of cycle_clock_offset.  It may be configurable or
   read-only.

   The value of -1 for tcqf.if_config[oif].cycle_clock_offset is used to
   indicate that the domain wide tcqf.cycle_clock_offset is to be used
   for oif.  This is the only permitted negative number for this
   parameter.

   When a packet is received from iif with a cycle value of iif_cycle
   and the packet is routed towards oif, then the cycle value (and
   buffer) to use on oif is
   tcqf.if_config[oif].cycle_map[iif].oif_cycle[iif_cycle].  This is
   called the cycle mapping and is must be configurable.  This cycle
   mapping always happens when the packet is received with a cycle tag
   on an interface in a TCQF domain and forwarded to another interface
   in the same TCQF domain.

   tcqf_tc[oif].tc[oif_cycle] defines how to map from the internal cycle
   number oif_cycle to an MPLS TC value on interface oif.  When
   tcqf_tc[oif] is configured, oif will use MPLS TC tagging for TCQF.
   This mapping not only used to map from internal cycle number to MPLS
   TC tag when sending packets, but also to map from MPLS TC tag to the
   internal cycle number when receiving packets.

3.3.  TCQF with label stack operations

   In the terminology of [RFC3270], TCQF QoS as defined here, is TC-
   Inferred-PSC LSP (E-LSP) behavior: Packets are determined to belong
   to the TCQF PSC solely based on the TC of the received packet.

   The internal cycle number SHOULD be assigned from the Top of Stack
   (ToS) MPLS label TC bits before any other label stack operations
   happens.  On the egress side, the TC value of the ToS MPLS label
   SHOULD be assigned from the internal cycle number after any label
   stack processing.

Internet-Draft             detnet-mpls-tc-tcqf              October 2021


   With this order of processing, TCQF can support forwarding of packets
   with any label stack operations such as label swap in the case of LDP
   or RSVP-TE created LSP, or no label changes from SID hop-by-hop
   forwarding and/or SID/label pop as in the case of SR-MPLS traffic
   steering.

3.4.  Ingres operations

   The ingress LSR of a TCQF domain has to mark packets with an internal
   cycle number and ensure that any such marked traffic complies with
   the traffic envelope admitted by the controller plane.

   The algorithms to map packets of traffic flows into cycles are
   outside the scope of this specification, because there can be
   multiple ones of varying complexity.  In a most simple admission
   model, a particular flow is allocated a maximum number of bytes in
   every cycle.  This can easily be mapped into an appropriate policing
   gate.

   For the purpose of this specification, such ingress operations is
   simply represented as an (internal/virtual) interface from which the
   packet is received, complete with a correctly assigned internal cycle
   number.

4.  TCQF Pseudocode (normative)

   The following pseudocode restates the forwarding behavior of
   Section 3 in an algorithmic fashion as pseudocode.  It uses the
   objects of the TCQF configuration data model defined in Section 3.1.

   void receive(pak) {
     // Receive side TCQF - remember cycle in
     // packet internal header
     iif = pak.context.iif
     if (tcqf.if_config[iif]) { // TCQF enabled on iif
       if (tcqf_tc[iif]) {      // MPLS TCQF enabled on iif
         tc = pak.mpls_header.lse[tos].tc
         pak.context.tcqf_cycle = map_tc2cycle( tc, tcqf_tc[iif])
       } else // other future encap/tagging options for TCQF
     }
     forward(pak);
   }

   void inject_tcqf_pak(pak, cycle) {
     pak.context.iif = INTERNAL
     pak.context.tcqf_cycle = cycle
     forward(pak);
   }

     oif = pak.context.oif = forward_process(pak)

     // ... optional  DetNet PREOF functions here
     // ... if router is DetNet service node

        tcqf.if_config[oif]) {    // TCQF enabled

       while(pak = dequeue(oif.cycleq(cycle)) {

       }
       cycle = (cycle + 1) mod tcqf.cycles + 1
       nextcyclestart += tcqf.cycle_time
     }

5.1.  Controller plane computation of cycle mappings

   The cycle mapping is computed by the controller plane by taking at
   minimum the link, interface serialization and node internal
   forwarding latencies as well as the cycle_clock_offsets into account.

   Consider in {#Calc1} that Router R1 sends packets via C = 3 cycles
   with a cycle_clock offset of O1 towards Router R2.  These packets
   arrive at R2 with a cycle_clock offset of O1' which includes through
   D all latencies incurred between releasing a packet on R1 from the
   cycle buffer until it can be put into a cycle buffer on R2:
   serialization delay on R1, link delay, non_CQF delays in R1 and R2,
   especially forwarding in R2, potentially across an internal fabric to
   the output interface with the sending cycle buffers.

   A = ( ceil( ( O1' - O2 ) / CT) + C + 1) mod CC
   map(i) = (i - 1 + A) mod C + 1

                    Figure 5: Calculating cycle mapping

   {#Calc2} shows a formula to calculate the cycle mapping between R1
   and R2, using the first available cycle on R2.  In the example of
   {#Calc1} with CT = 1, (O1' - O2) =~ 1.8, A will be 0, resulting in
   map(1) to be 1, map(2) to be 2 and map(3) to be 3.

   The offset "C" for the calculation of A is included so that a
   negative (O1 - O2) will still lead to a positive A.

   In general, D will be variable [Dmin...Dmax], for example because of
   differences in serialization latency between min and max size
   packets, variable link latency because of temperature based length
   variations, link-layer variability (radio links) or in-router
   processing variability.  In addition, D also needs to account for the
   drift between the synchronized clocks for R1 and R2.  This is called
   the Maximum Time Interval Error (MTIE).

   Let A(d) be A where O1' is calculated with D = d.  To account for the
   variability of latency and clock synchronization, map(i) has to be
   calculated with A(Dmax), and the controller plane needs to ensure
   that that A(Dmin)...A(Dmax) does cover at most (C - 1) cycles.

   If it does cover C cycles, then C and/or CT are chosen too small, and
   the controller plane needs to use larger numbers for either.

   This (C - 1) limitation is based on the understanding that there is
   only one buffer for each cycle, so a cycle cannot receive packets
   when it is sending packets.  While this could be changed by using
   double buffers, this would create additional implementation
   complexity and not solve the limitation for all cases, because the
   number of cycles to cover [Dmin...Dmax] could also be (C + 1) or
   larger, in which case a tag of 1...C would not suffice.

   Added new co-author.

   Changed Data Model to "Configuration Data Model",

   and changed syntax from YANG tree to a non-YANG tree, removed empty
   section targeted for YANG model.  Reason: the configuration
   parameters that we need to specify the forwarding behavior is only a
   subset of what likely would be a good YANG model, and any work to

   define such a YANG model not necessary to specify the algorithm would
   be scope creep for this specification.  Better done in a separate
   YANG document.  Example additional YANG aspects for such a document
   are how to map parameters to configuration/operational space, what
   additional operational/monitoring parameter to support and how to map
   the YANG objects required into various pre-existing YANG trees.

   Improved text in forwarding section, simplified sentences, used
   simplified configuration data model.
