Abstract

    Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) version 4rev1 has basic
    support for non-ASCII characters in mailbox names and search
    substrings.  It also supports non-ASCII message headers and content
    encoded as specified by Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
    (MIME).  This specification defines a collection of IMAP extensions
    which improve international support including comparator negotiation
    for search, sort and thread, language negotiation for international
    error text, and translations for namespace prefixes.

2. Introduction

    This specification defines two IMAP4rev1 [6] extensions to enhance
    international support.  These extensions can be advertised and
    implemented separately.

    The LANGUAGE extension allows the client to request a suitable
    language for protocol error messages and in combination with the
    NAMESPACE extension [4] enables namespace translations.

    The COMPARATOR extension allows the client to request a suitable
    comparator which will modify the behavior of the base
    specification's SEARCH command as well as the SORT and THREAD
    extensions [15].  This leverages the comparator registry [8].


3. LANGUAGE Extension

    IMAP allows server responses to include human-readable text that in
    many cases needs to be presented to the user.  But that text is
    limited to US-ASCII by the IMAP specification [6] in order to
    preserve backwards compatibility with deployed IMAP implementations.
    This section specifies a way for an IMAP client to negotiate which
    language the server should use when sending human-readable text.

    The LANGUAGE extension only provides a mechanism for altering fixed
    server strings such as response text and NAMESPACE folder names.
    Assigning localized language aliases to shared mailboxes would be
    done with a separate mechanism such as the proposed ANNOTATEMORE
    extension. [16]


3.1 LANGUAGE Extension Requirements

    IMAP servers that support this extension MUST list the keyword
    LANGUAGE in their CAPABILITY response as well as in the greeting
    CAPABILITY data.

    A server that advertises this extension MUST use the language "i-
    default" as described in [3] as its default language until another
    supported language is negotiated by the client. A server MUST
    include "i-default" as one of its supported languages.

    A client that supports this extension MUST be prepared for a
    possible NAMESPACE response [4] from the server.

    The LANGUAGE command is valid in all states.

3.2 LANGUAGE Command

    Arguments: Optional language range argument.

    Response:  A possible LANGUAGE response (see Section 3.3).
               A possible NAMESPACE response as defined by [4].

    Result:    OK - Command completed
               NO - Could not complete command
               BAD - arguments invalid

    The LANGUAGE command requests that human-readable text emitted by
    the server be localized to a language matching the language range
    argument as described by section 2.5 of RFC 3066.

    If the command succeeds, the server will return human-readable
    responses in the specified language starting with the tagged OK
    response to the LANGUAGE command.  These responses will be in UTF-8
    [7].

    If the command fails, the server will continue to return human-
    readable responses in the language it was previously using.

    The client MUST NOT use MUL (Multiple languages) or UND
    (Undetermined) language tags and the server MUST return BAD if
    either tag is used.  The special "*" language range argument
    indicates a request to use a language designated as preferred by the
    server administrator.  The preferred language MAY vary based on the
    currently active user.

    If the language range does not match a known language tag exactly
    but does match a language by the rules of section 2.5 of [5], the
    server MUST send an untagged LANGUAGE response indicating the
    language selected.

    If the language range argument is omitted, the server SHOULD send an
    untagged LANGUAGE response listing the languages it supports.  If
    the server is unable to enumerate the list of languages it supports
    it MAY return a tagged NO response to the enumeration request.

        < The server defaults to using English i-default responses until
          the user explicitly changes the language. >

        C: A001 LOGIN KAREN PASSWORD
        S: A001 OK LOGIN completed

        < Client requested MUL language. Server MUST reply with BAD. >

3.3 LANGUAGE Response

    Contents:  A list of one or more language tags.

    The LANGUAGE response occurs as a result of a LANGUAGE command.  A
    LANGUAGE response with a list containing a single language tag
    indicates that the server is now using that language.  A LANGUAGE
    response with a list containing multiple language tags indicates the
    server is communicating a list of available languages to the client,
    and no change in the active language has been made.

3.4 TRANSLATION Extension to the NAMESPACE Response

    If the server supports the IMAP4 NAMESPACE command [4], the server
    MUST return an untagged NAMESPACE response when a language is
    negotiated.  However the server MUST NOT return a NAMESPACE response
    if it is in not-authenticated state.

    If as a result of the newly negotiated language, localized
    representations of the namespace prefixes are available, the server
    SHOULD include these in the TRANSLATION extension to the NAMESPACE
    response.

    The TRANSLATION extension to the NAMESPACE response returns a single
    string, containing the modified UTF-7 [6] encoded translation of the
    namespace prefix.  It is the responsibility of the client to convert
    between the namespace prefix and the translation of the namespace
    prefix when presenting mailbox names to the user.

    In this example a server supports the IMAP4 NAMESPACE command. It
    uses no prefix to the user's Personal Namespace, a prefix of "Other
    Users" to its Other Users' Namespace and a prefix of "Public
    Folders" to its only Shared Namespace.  Since a client will often
    display these prefixes to the user, the server includes a
    translation of them that can be presented to the user.

        C: A001 LANGUAGE DE-IT
        S: * NAMESPACE (("" "/"))(("Other Users/" "/" "TRANSLATION"
              ("Andere Ben&APw-tzer/"))) (("Public Folders/" "/"
              "TRANSLATION" ("Gemeinsame Mailboxen/")))
        S: A001 OK LANGUAGE-Befehl ausgefuehrt


3.5 Formal Syntax

    The following syntax specification inherits ABNF [2] rules from
    IMAP4rev1 [6], IMAP4 Namespace [4], Tags for the Identification of
    Languages [5], and UTF-8 [7].

        command-any     =/ language-cmd
            ; LANGUAGE command is valid in all states

        language-cmd    = "LANGUAGE" [SP lang-range-quoted]

        language-data   = "LANGUAGE" SP "(" lang-tag-quoted *(SP lang-
                          tag-quoted) ")"

        namespace-trans = SP DQUOTE "TRANSLATION" DQUOTE SP "(" string
                          ")"
            ; the string is encoded in Modified UTF-7.
            ; this is a subset of the syntax permitted by
            ; the Namespace_Response_Extension rule in RFC 2342

        lang-range-quoted = astring
            ; Once any literal wrapper or quoting is removed, this
            ; follows the language-range rule in section 2.5 of RFC 3066

        lang-tag-quoted = astring
            ; Once any literal wrapper or quoting is removed, this
            follows
            ; the Language-Tag rule in section 2.1 of RFC 3066

        ; After the server is changed to a language other than
        ; i-default, the resp-text rule from RFC 3501 is replaced
        ; with the following:

        resp-text       = ["[" resp-text-code "]" SP ] UTF8-TEXT-CHAR
                          *(UTF8-TEXT-CHAR / "[")

        UTF8-TEXT-CHAR  = %x20-%x5A / %x5C-%x7E / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 /
                          UTF8-4
            ; UTF-8 excluding 7-bit control characters and "["


4. COMPARATOR Extension

    IMAP4rev1 [6] includes the SEARCH command which can be used to
    locate messages matching criteria including human-readable text.
    The SORT extension [15] to IMAP allows the client to ask the server
    to determine the order of messages based on criteria including
    human-readable text.  These mechanisms require the ability to
    support non-English search and sort functions.

    This section defines an IMAP extension to negotiate use of
    comparators [8] to internationalize IMAP SEARCH, SORT and THREAD.
    The IMAP extension consists of a new command to determine or change
    the active comparator and a new response to indicate the active
    comparator and possibly other available comparators.

    The term "default comparator" refers to the comparator which is used
    by SEARCH and SORT absent any negotiation using the COMPARATOR
    command.  The term "active comparator" refers to the comparator
    which will be used within a session e.g. by SEARCH and SORT.  The
    COMPARATOR command is used to change the active comparator.

Internet-draft                                             February 2006


    The active comparator applies to the following SEARCH keys: "BCC",
    "BODY", "CC", "FROM", "SUBJECT", "TEXT", "TO" and "HEADER".  If the
    server also advertises the "SORT" extension, then the active
    comparator applies to the following SORT keys: "CC", "FROM",
    "SUBJECT" and "TO".  If the server advertises the
    THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT, then the active comparator applies to the
    ORDEREDSUBJECT threading algorithm.  Future extensions may choose to
    apply the active comparator to their SEARCH keys.

    For SORT and THREAD, the pre-processing necessary to extract the
    base subject text from a Subject header occurs prior to the
    application of a comparator.


4.1 COMPARATOR Extension Requirements

    IMAP servers that support this extension MUST list the keyword
    COMPARATOR in their CAPABILITY data once IMAP enters authenticated
    state, and MAY list that keyword in other states.

    A server that advertises this extension MUST implement the en;ascii-
    casemap and i;octet comparators, as defined in [8].  A server
    intended to be deployed globally MUST implement the
    i;basic;uca=3.1.1;uv=3.2 comparator.

    A server that advertises this extension MUST use a registered case-
    insensitive comparator which supports the substring matching
    function as the default comparator.  If the server also advertises
    the SORT or THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT extensions, then the default
    comparator MUST also support the ordering function.  The selection
    of the default comparator MAY be adjustable by the server
    administrator, and MAY be sensitive to the current user.  Once the
    IMAP connection enters authenticated state, the default comparator
    MUST remain static for the remainder of that connection.

    A server that advertises this extension MUST support UTF-8 as a
    SEARCH charset.

    The COMPARATOR command is valid in authenticated and selected
    states.

4.2 Comparators and Charsets

    For SEARCH, SORT and THREAD operations that apply to message
    headers, the server is responsible for removing the MIME header
    encoding [10] and converting the text of any known charsets to UTF-8
    prior to applying the comparator algorithm.  Unknown charsets should
    never match when using the SEARCH command, and should sort together
    with invalid comparator input for the SORT and THREAD commands.

    When message text is in a known charset other than UTF-8, the server
    is responsible for converting that text to UTF-8 prior to applying
    the comparator.  When message text is in an unknown charset, then
    the text should be skipped by the SEARCH command unless the
    comparator is i;octet.


4.3 COMPARATOR Command

    Arguments: Optional comparator order arguments.

    Response:  A possible COMPARATOR response (see Section 4.4).

    Result:    OK - Command completed
               NO - No matching comparator found
               BAD - arguments invalid

    The COMPARATOR command is used to determine or change the active
    comparator.  When issued with no arguments, it results in a
    COMPARATOR response indicating the currently active comparator.
    When issued with one or more comparator order argument, it will
    change the active comparator if any comparator matches any argument.
    The COMPARATOR response will list other matching comparators if more
    than one matches the specified patterns.

    The argument "*" refers to the server's default comparator.
    Otherwise each argument is an comparator specification as defined in
    the Internet Application Protocol Comparator Registry [8].

        < The client requests activating a Czech comparator if possible,
          or else a generic international comparator which it considers
          suitable for Czech. The server picks the first supported
          comparator. >

4.4 COMPARATOR Response

    Contents:  The active comparator.
               An optional list of available matching comparators

    The COMPARATOR response occurs as a result of a COMPARATOR command.
    The first argument in the comparator response is the name of the
    active comparator.  The second argument is a list of comparators
    which matched any of the arguments to the COMPARATOR command and is
    present only if more than one match is found.


4.5 Formal Syntax

5. Other IMAP Internationalization Issues

    The following sections provide an overview of various other IMAP
    internationalization issues.  These issues are not resolved by this
    specification, but could be resolved by future standards work.


5.1 Unicode Userids and Passwords

    IMAP4rev1 presently restricts the userid and password fields of the
    LOGIN command to US-ASCII. The "userid" and "password" fields of the
    IMAP LOGIN command are restricted to US-ASCII only until a future
    standards track RFC states otherwise.  Servers are encouraged to
    validate both fields to make sure they conform to the formal syntax
    of UTF-8 and to reject the LOGIN command if that syntax is violated.
    Servers MAY reject the use of any 8-bit in the "userid" or
    "password" field.

    When AUTHENTICATE is used, some servers may support userids and
    passwords in Unicode [13]. However, such userids cannot be used as
    email addresses, and at present also seem to be incompatible with
    the current latest ACL drafts. Unless the ACL drafts resolve this,
    server authors are cautioned against supporting ACL and unicode
    userids simultaneously.


5.2 UTF-8 Mailbox Names

    The modified UTF-7 mailbox naming convention described in section
    5.1.3 of RFC 3501 is best viewed as an transition from the status
    quo in 1996 when modified UTF-7 was first specified.  At that time,
    there was widespread unofficial use of local character sets such as
    ISO-8859-1 and Shift-JIS for non-ASCII mailbox names, with resultant
    non-interoperability.

    The requirements in section 5.1 of RFC 3501 are very important if
    we're ever going to be able to deploy UTF-8 mailbox names. Servers
    are encourated to enforce them.

5.3 UTF-8 Domains, Addresses and Mail Headers

    There is now an IETF standard for Internationalizing Domain Names in
    Applications [13].  While IMAP clients are free to support this
    standard, an argument can be made that it would be helpful to simple
    clients if the IMAP server could perform this conversion (the same
    argument would apply to MIME header encoding [10]).  However, it
    would be unwise to move forward with such work until the work in
    progress to define the format of international email addresses is
    complete.


6. IANA Considerations

    When this is published as an RFC, the IMAP extensions LANGUAGE and
    COMPARATOR are registered.


7. Security Considerations

    The LANGUAGE extension makes a new command available in "Not
    Authenticated" state in IMAP.  Some IMAP implementations run with
    root privilege when the server is in "Not Authenticated" state and
    do not revoke that privilege until after authentication is complete.
    Such implementations are particularly vulnerable to buffer overflow
    security errors at this stage and need to implement parsing of this
    command with extra care.

    A LANGUAGE command issued prior to activation of a security layer is
    subject to an active attack which suppresses or modifies the
    negotiation and thus makes STARTTLS or authentication error messages
    more difficult to interpret.  This is not a new attack as the error
    messages themselves are subject to active attack.  Clients MUST re-
    issue the LANGUAGE command once a security layer is active, so this
    does not impact subsequent protocol operations.

    Both the LANGUAGE and COMPARATOR extensions use the UTF-8 charset,
    thus the security considerations for UTF-8 [7] are relevent.
    However, neither uses UTF-8 for identifiers so the most serious
    concerns do not apply.

8. Acknowledgements

    The LANGUAGE extension is based on a previous Internet draft by Mike
    Gahrns and Alexey Melnikov, a substantial portion of the text in
    that section was written by them.  Many people have participated in
    discussions about an IMAP Language extension in the various fora of
    the IETF and Internet working groups, so any list of contributors is
    bound to be incomplete.  However, the authors would like to thank
    Andrew McCown for early work on the original proposal, John Myers
    for suggestions regarding the namespace issue, along with Jutta
    Degener, Mark Crispin, Mark Pustilnik, Larry Osterman and Martin
    Duerst for their many suggestions that have been incorporated into
    this document.

    Initial discussion of the COMPARATOR extension involved input from
    Mark Crispin and other participants of the IMAP Extensions WG.


9. Relevant Standards for i18n IMAP Implementations

    This is a non-normative list of standards to consider when
    implementing i18n aware IMAP software.

      o The LANGUAGE and COMPARATOR extensions to IMAP (this
        specification).
      o The 8-bit rules for mailbox naming in section 5.1 of RFC 3501.
      o The Mailbox International Naming Convention in section 5.1.3 of
        RFC 3501.
      o MIME [9] for message bodies.
      o MIME header encoding [10] for message headers.
      o MIME Parameter Value and Encoded Word Extensions [11] for
        filenames.  Quality IMAP server implementations will
        automatically combine multipart parameters when generating the
        BODYSTRUCTURE. There is also some deployed non-standard use of
        MIME header encoding inside double-quotes for filenames.
      o IDNA [13] and punycode [14] for domain names (presently only
        relevant to IMAP clients).
      o The UTF-8 charset [7].
      o The IETF policy on Character Sets and Languages [3].
