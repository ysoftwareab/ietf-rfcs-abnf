     Clarifying and Updating the Document Conflict Review Procedure
                    draft-klensin-iesg-rfc5742bis-00

Abstract

   The IESG procedures for conducting conflict reviews of Independent
   and IRTF Stream Submissions, described in RFC 5742, have proven
   excessively restrictive in ways that prevent the IESG from adequately
   expressing its opinions and that can interfere with an open and
   transparent process.  This document updates RFC 5742 to mitigate that
   problem.

1.  Introduction

   one or more digits, and a right square bracket are references to the
   Endnotes in Appendix A.

   In 2009, the IESG proposed, approved, and published a description of
   the procedures it intended to use to process the conflict reviews of
   Independent and IRTF Stream Submissions [RFC5742].  Those reviews
   were called for by earlier specifications that had been extensively
   debated in the community [RFC4846] [RFC5743].  In addition to
   outlining procedures to be followed, RFC 5742 includes a set of
   categories into which IESG responses are expected to fall and
   corresponding text to be used in responses to the relevant stream
   managers.  At least in retrospect, some members of the community
   believed that that those categories and textual statements specified
   all of the positions that the IESG could take and all of the
   responses they could generate.  Others believed that the categories

   and text provided guidance for the common cases that could be
   anticipated but that the IESG could depart from them as needed as
   long as the general principle of a conflict review rather than a
   technical one was adhered to.  The latter interpretation was seen to
   be consistent with a very long standing IETF principle that we
   prioritize good sense over rigid procedures and allow relevant bodies
   to make adjustments as required by circumstances even if an exception
   procedure is required in some more extreme cases.

   This difference in interpretations of RFC 5742 was highlighted in the
   middle of 2018, when the IESG reported on a conflict review of a
   draft from the Independent Stream [IESG-ConflictReview].  That
   response seemed to at least some members of the community to be badly
   matched to the document in question, leading to an appeal
   [klensin-appeal] that was intended to be primarily about how the IESG
   was interpreting and using RFC 5742 [1].

   The IESG's response to the appeal [IESG-response] indicated, in its
   Section 5, that they believed the only response they could give to a
   conflict review request were those specified in the exact text of RFC
   5742, that they could not make exceptions to that text on their own
   (i.e., that the text of RFC 5742 was "exhaustive and constraining"
   (Section 5 of the appeal response)) [2], and invited members of the
   community who believe that RFC 5742 was inappropriate or insufficient
   to propose revisions "through the appropriate IETF processes"
   (Section 4 of the appeal response).  This document is a response to
   that suggestion and updates RFC 5742 in line with the explanation
   above.

   For simplicity and clarity, the present document is written in terms
   of the Independent Stream.  However, the specific changes proposed
   are consistent with the scope of RFC 5742, i.e., covering both
   Independent Stream and IRTF documents.

2.  Proposal Part I: Add a Missing Category to RFC 5742

2.1.  Explanation

   A recurring issue with Independent Submissions (and, in principle,
   documents from other non-IETF Streams) is that some of the documents
   submitted are insufficiently clear about their role and specifically
   that they are not IETF standards or other normative documents.  Such
   documents may create confusion about status for which no amount of
   boilerplate (which many people don't read) is an adequate remedy.
   Such a document might be entirely acceptable for Independent Stream
   publication if it were more clear on that subject but is problematic
   without that category.  Under ordinary circumstances involving the
   pre-publication review contemplated by RFC 4846, clarifications along

Internet-Draft           Conflict Review Update           September 2018


   those lines will be made by the author(s), with input from the
   Independent Submission Editor as needed, well before the document
   reaches the IESG for a conflict review.  However, when the IESG
   concludes that the document, as presented for conflict review, is
   insufficiently clear about its role, it should be allowed (or even
   encouraged) to respond with a category and in a way that makes the
   issue clear.  In addition, a document's being unclear about its
   intended role is one case in which it is likely to be appropriate for
   the IESG to say something equivalent to "get that clarified and then
   we would like to do a more substantive conflict review".

   This new category is consistent with, and in the spirit of, the
   discussion in Section 5 of RFC 5742; it just provides more
   information for the submitting streams and the community.

2.2.  Changes to RFC 5742

   In Section 3:

   1.  In the third paragraph, change "five" to "six"

   2.  Add a new numbered item, reading as follows, after numbered item
       2 of the third paragraph and renumber subsequent items.

       3. The IESG has concluded that the body text of the draft is
          insufficiently clear about the status of the document, e.g.,
          that it is too difficult to tell from the text alone that the
          draft, if published in its current form, is not an IETF
          standards track document.  The IESG would welcome the
          opportunity to do a review for substantive conflicts after
          that problem is corrected.

3.  Proposal Part II: Clarify and Extend the Permanent "Do Not Publish"
    Recommendations

3.1.  Explanation

   As suggested in the appeal, in RFC 4846, and in Section 5 of RFC
   5742, the primary intent of having "do not publish" categories was to
   keep an Independent Stream publication from violating IETF procedures
   or interfering with active or developing IETF work, especially
   normative IETF work.  In part because the notion of Independent
   Submissions to the RFC Editor (which, in one form or another, predate
   the IETF by many years) was to allow challenging, critiquing, or
   presenting alternatives to community decisions (and, later, IETF
   standards) that category should not be used in a way that creates the
   impression of attempted IESG censorship, even if (as RFC 4842 makes

Internet-Draft           Conflict Review Update           September 2018


   clear) the Independent Submission Editor is free to reject the IESG's
   recommendation.

   Seen in that light and in the light of the discussion of the previous
   section, the "do not publish" recommendations (numbered items 4 and 5
   of Section 3 of RFC 5742) are for explicit violations of IETF
   procedures (e.g., an attempt to establish a new protocol parameter
   where the base protocol explicitly requires IETF review and IESG
   approval) or, primarily for more extreme cases of apparent conflicts
   with IETF work, circumstances for which a request for a delay while
   the IETF finishes a particular piece of work, especially work that
   may take a long time.

   Consequently, it is appropriate to modify the "do not publish"
   discussion and text to require that the IESG either identify the
   specific procedure or requirement that would be violated, the
   specific work with which the document would interfere, or otherwise
   justify the decision.  A reference to IESG ballot comments, recorded
   in the tracker or elsewhere, is not sufficient for this purpose
   because it is often not clear whether such a comment is an
   observation by a particular AD or a statement that represents IESG
   consensus and for which the IESG is willing to be held accountable.

3.2.  Changes to RFC 5742

   1.  In Section 3, at the end of the fifth full paragraphs ("The last
       two responses...") add:

          For the last two responses above, the IESG is expected to
          include a specific reference to, or discussion of, the
          procedure that would be violated or the protocols that specify
          requirements for IETF review.  It is expected to do so in
          sufficient detail that document authors, the relevant stream
          managers, and the community can evaluate the review
          conclusions.  The last response should be applied only with
          extreme care because it effectively adds an additional
          requirement to the original specification without review or
          approval by the IETF and with no assurance about consistency
          with other documents and decisions.

   2.  In Section 3, last numbered item, change "an IETF protocol" to
       "IETF protocol(s) for <Y>".

4.  Proposal Part III: Make Authorization for IESG Flexibility and
    Discretion Explicit in RFC 5742

4.1.  Explanation

   As discussed in Section 1 above, one of the important properties of
   the way the IETF does things is that we put flexibility and the
   ability to apply good sense ahead of rigid procedures when those two
   approaches conflict.  Apparently it is necessary to explicitly apply
   the principle of the priority of good sense and flexibility to RFC
   5742.

4.2.  Change to RFC 5742

   In Section 3, after the numbered list, add a new paragraph that
   reads:

      The above types of conclusions and responses are descriptive and
      not prescriptive.  Should the IESG encounter unusual circumstances
      within the scope of a conflict review and the spirit of this
      document, it may modify reply text as needed.  It is far
      preferable for the IESG to have, and exercise, discretion about
      the text chosen than to utilize text that does not fit the
      circumstances and therefore confuses the relevant stream, the
      community, and the historical record about the actual character of
      the problem the IESG has identified.

5.  Further Context and Issues

   While not addressed in this document, in part because the issues may
   be more controversial rather than closer to extended clarifications,
   the language of RFC 5742 appears to raise two additional issues, one
   or both of which might be further explored if and when the community
   thinks that would be appropriate.

5.1.  Definition of an "IETF Protocol"

   Paragraph 3 of RFC 5742 refers to an "IETF protocol".  It is not
   clear whether that is a standards track Technical Specification; a
   Technical Specification, even an Informational or Experimental one,
   published with IETF consensus; any document published in the IETF
   Stream, even one that is not a Technical Specification; or, in the
   most extreme case, any document published or posted under rules or
   procedures set by the IETF.

   Having this be unclear, or subject to different interpretations on
   different occasions, is probably not wise.

Internet-Draft           Conflict Review Update           September 2018


5.2.  Procedure for Updating a Specification Published as an RFC

   Bullet item 5 of Section 3 of RFC 5742 refers to an "IETF protocol"
   and "in a way that requires IETF review".  Normally, a requirement
   for IETF review can be imposed only in an IANA Considerations
   provision or other text or in the protocol specification itself.
   Decisions about which extensions require IETF review and approval are
   normally made by IETF consensus and the only way to change those
   decisions requires updating the specification, an action that itself
   requires IETF consensus.

   However, paragraph 5 of Section 3 appears to allow the IESG to
   decide, without consulting the IETF community, that the original
   authors of a specification (and the IETF) erred in not requiring IETF
   review and to ask the ISE to not publish a document because such
   review is, in the IESG's judgment, required after all.  Independent
   of other issues, there is some question about whether it is
   appropriate for the IESG to effectively update a protocol
   specification, even a standards track one, to change the requirements
   for extensions without consulting the community in any way, much less
   without ascertaining IETF consensus.

6.  Possible Future Work: The Variance Procedure

   The variance procedure described in Section 9.3 of RFC 2026 [RFC2026]
   is limited in scope to issues involving the approval of standards.  A
   very narrow reading of it, and application of the principle sometimes
   described as "anything not explicitly permitted is forbidden", could
   imply that no variances are permitted for any other IETF procedure,
   at least without standards-track (including BCP) action.  That
   reading appears to be excessively constraining and is inconsistent
   with situations in the past in which they IESG has issued statements
   or used very liberal interpretations of documents in order to apply
   common sense and make the right things happen.  So, if the IESG
   interpretation of RFC 5742 that led to this document is likely to be
   applied more broadly, it will likely be useful to update RFC 2026 (or
   some other relevant process document) to extrapolate the variance
   procedure to other cases.

7.  IANA Considerations

   [[CREF1: RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.]]

   This memo includes no requests to or actions for IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   As was the case with RFC 5742, the changes in this memo have no
   direct bearing on the security of the Internet.
