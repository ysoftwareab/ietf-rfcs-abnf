1. Motivations 
    
   As indicated in the current working group charter, the objective of 
   the NSIS work is to develop a simplified solution to signal QoS 
   requirements for variety types of multimedia services over the 
   Internet.   
    
   At the moment, the discussions so far seem to look into all aspects 
   of the signaling issues that were encountered in the network.  In 
   addition, there is no specific network model that can be referred 
   by the NSIS working group to focus on the signaling requirements 
   discussion at different network levels.  Hence, this draft brings 
   forward a network model that was derived from the Session 
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC 2543] network architecture so that 
   the NSIS working group can use it as the base to identify the scope 
   of the working area and to build the consensus on the requirements 
   as well as the solutions.  However, it is not the objective of this 
   draft to propose the following network model as the NSIS signaling 
   reference model.  
    
   The intents of this draft are:  
   -
    to identify the two main streams of control signaling in a 
     telecommunication network to support multi-media services - i.e. 
     call control signaling and bearer control signaling. 
   -
    to recommend the focus on the bearer control signaling by the 
     NSIS WG since it is more related to use of the Internet as the 
     transport medium to support the requested QoS transport 
     characteristic, and leave the call control signaling to other 
     consortium to tackle since it is more related to the network 
     services and policy control.

2. Modified SIP Network Architecture   
    
   The following describes the network model that is derived from the 
   SIP network architecture that depicts the separation of the call 
   control signaling from the bearer control signaling to support 
   multi-media services.

3. Concepts of Bearer Control Signaling vs. Call Control Signaling 
    
   The purpose of Bearer Control Signaling is to communicate QoS 
   information to the transport network so that the network can make 
   the necessary arrangements and provide to the requesting 
   application a bearer channel/path with the described transport 
   characteristic. Bearer control signaling does not necessarily 
   traverse the transport network end-to-end uninterrupted, but at 
   certain intermediary nodes is elevated and interpreted. These 
   intermediate nodes need therefore to understand the signaling 
   content and make the necessary actions in response to it.  
    
   The Call Control signaling could logically be modeled after the 
   manner of an end-to-end application layer protocol specifically 
   tailored for the service at hand. For example, SS7 in PSTN is 
   geared towards providing voice grade services on demand and 
   providing policy control.  The span of the call control signaling 
   is likely end-to-end.  
    
    
4. Rationales 
    
   Although there is a strong desire from the service providers to 
   consolidate their networks to support multi-media services, their 
   main intent is to converge the transport infrastructure and not the 
   services infrastructure.  It is because different types of services 
   require different platforms to manage the services, e.g. SS7 IN 
   services for PSTN, of which those infrastructure takes years to 
   build and to mature.   
    
   It is extremely economical for the service providers to be able to 
   migrate their multi-media traffic from the multi-services network 
   onto the Internet along with their data traffic.  It also open the 
   opportunity for the service providers to offer new services for the 
   emerging new application, e.g. wireless applications and DSL etc.  
    
   Hence, it is important for the NSIS to develop a generic bearer 
   control signaling mechanism to specify certain transport 
   characteristic to establish the bearer to carry multimedia traffic.

6. Recommendation 
    
   The intent of this draft is to identify the scope of the NSIS 
   working group on the simplified signaling design to provide QoS 
   support for multimedia services over Internet.

   It is important for the NSIS working group to focus on the bearer 
   control aspect of the signaling design so that the Internet can be 
   used to provide high quality transport of the multimedia traffic.
