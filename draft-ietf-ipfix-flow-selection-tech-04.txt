Abstract

   Flow selection is the process of selecting a subset of flows from all
   flows observed at an observation point.  The objective of flow
   selection is to reduce the effort of post-processing flow data and
   transferring flow records.  The flow selection process can be enabled
   at different stages of the measurement process.  It can be applied
   either directly after classification or at recording/exporting time
   by limiting the number of flows to be stored and/or exported to the
   collecting process.  This document describes motivations for flow
   selection and presents flow selection techniques.  It furthermore
   provides an information model for configuring flow selection
   techniques and discusses what information about a flow selection
   process is worth exporting through a suitable information model.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes flow selection techniques for traffic
   measurements.  As stated in [RFC5475], packet selection is the
   process of selecting a subset of packets among those collected at an
   observation point.  The element on which this selection mechanism is
   performed is a single packet and the selection decision is random,
   deterministic or based on packet properties.  In contrast to this,
   flow selection techniques consider flows as the basic elements on
   which a selection process is performed.  A flow is defined as a set
   of packets with common properties [IPFIX-REQ].  Flow selection
   reduces the resource demands for capturing, storing, exporting and
   post-processing flow-based measurement results.  Maintaining and
   exporting all flow records to the collecting process can exhaust
   available resources with the result that measurement data is
   discarded which reduces the utility of the measurement data and makes
   accurate estimations impossible.  Flow Selection can be applied to
   only select flows that are of interest for a certain application or
   to select a representative subset of the flows.  Selecting
   representative subsets of flows allows for flow characteristic
   estimation while reducing the measurement data.  Example applications
   in which flow selections can be applied are accounting, attack and
   intrusion detection, traffic engineering, traffic classification,
   etc..  In many networks few large flows contribute to the majority of
   the overall traffic volume [DuLT01a], [DuLT01b], which is also
   referred to as "Quasi-Zipf-Law" [KuXW04].  This "elephant and mice"
   phenomenon plays an important role in flow based measurements as it
   poses challenges on the flow selection process depending on the
   application and the available resources.  For example in accounting
   purposes it is useful to concentrate on the so-called "heavy hitter"
   flows to cope with a limited flow cache size or limited transmission
   capacity in times when resources are scarce.


2.  Scope

   This document describes flow selection techniques and their
   parameters.  It addresses the configuration of flow selection
   techniques and defines which information should be reported by
   devices that perform flow selection.  It only describes processes
   directly acting on traffic flows during the metering phase and/or the
   exporting phase.  Therefore it is assumed that flow selection is
   performed after packets are classified into flows.  This document
   does not address the flow selection effects that might arise from
   sampling or filtering packets in the metering process before the
   classification process is performed.  Such packet selection
   techniques are described in [RFC5475] and, therefore, are out of the
   scope of this document.

3.  Terminology

   This document is consistent with the terminology introduced in
   [RFC5470], [RFC5475] and [IPFIX-REQ].  Further some additional terms
   are presented which extend the terminology.

   * Flow

      A Flow is defined as a set of packets with common properties
      passing an Observation Point in the network during a certain time
      interval.

   * Flow Record

      A Flow Record contains information about a specific flow that was
      metered at an observation point.  A Flow Record contains measured
      properties of the flow (e.g., the total number of bytes of all
      packets of the flow) and usually characteristic properties of the
      flow (e.g., source IP address).

   * Classification

      Is a filtering process in which packets are mapped to specific
      flow records based on the packet properties.  These properties
      make up the flow key (e.g. header information, packet content, AS
      number).  In case a flow record for this specific flow key already
      exist the flow record is updated, otherwise a new flow record is
      created.

   * Flow Selection Process

      A Flow Selection Process takes a set of Flow Records as its input
      and selects a subset of that set as its output.

   * Flow Selection State

      A Flow Selection Process may maintain state information for use by
      the Flow Selection Process.  At a given time, the Flow Selection
      State may depend on flows observed at and before that time, as
      well as other variables.  Examples include:

        (i)   number of accounted flow records;

        (ii)  memory space available for flow recording;

Internet-Draft          Flow Selection Techniques           January 2011


        (iii) state of the pseudorandom number generators;

        (iv)  hash values calculated during the selection.

        (v)   timestamps of flow observation (e.g. first or last packet
              of flow) and flow duration

   * Flow Selector

      A Flow Selector defines the action of a Flow Selection Process on
      a single flow of its input.  The Flow Selector can make use of the
      following information in order to establish whether or not a flow
      has to be selected or not:

        (i)   the content of the flow record;

        (ii)  any information state related to the flow recording
              process;

        (iii) any flow selection state that may be maintained by the
              Flow Selection Process.

   * IPFIX Exporter

      The IPFIX exporter is a software that receives measurement data
      from e.g. the Metering Process and exports this data to a
      collector.

   * IPFIX Mediator

      The IPFIX Mediator receives flow records from IPFIX Exporters and,
      after some post-processing (e.g. more fine-grained selection),
      sends them to one or multiple Collectors.  This selection can be
      driven based on the information requested by the individual
      Collector.


4.  Flow selection as a function of the IPFIX Exporter

   Figure 1 shows the IPFIX reference model as defined in [RFC5470], and
   extends it by introducing the functional components where flow
   selection can take place.

       Figure 1: Flow selection as a function of the IPFIX Exporter

   In contrast to packet selection, flow selection is always applied
   after the packets are classified into flows.  Flows can be selected
   at different stages of the measurement chain:

   1.  during metering [RFC5475];

   2.  during flow recording;

   3.  during flow exporting.

4.1.  Flow selection in the metering process

   The main reason for applying flow state dependent sampling during the
   metering process is that the flow recording process may not have, at
   a certain point in time, enough memory positions to record all
   observable flows.  Another reason may be that there might not be
   enough processing resources to create and manage a new flow record.

   To overcome these limitations, a number of possible policies can be
   applied, the simplest one being to discard new packets which cannot
   be assigned to existing flow records (i.e. that would require the
   creation of a new flow record).  More complex policies are
   applicable, mainly aimed at detecting the so called elephant flows,
   so as to prioritize flows carrying a higher traffic volume in the
   flow recording process.  For instance, [EsVa01] proposes criteria to
   define a packet as eligible to create a new flow record (sample and
   hold, multistage filters).

   Regardless of specific algorithms, we are concerned about identifying
   what information on the flow state dependent packet sampling is worth
   keeping and making available to applications (by exporting it out of
   an IPFIX device).  An option could be to keep a cumulative counter of
   the total number of packets and bytes that were not taken into
   account for measurement purposes because of flow state dependent
   sampling.  Furthermore, it is possible to keep a timestamp for the
   first and last of these discarded packets.  In practice, this implies
   aggregating all these packets in a single macro flow, and keeping
   track of its volume and duration.  Storing more detailed information
   about packets which have not been measured because of flow state
   dependent sampling would contradict the fact that the sampling is
   done because of lack of memory and/or processing resources.

4.2.  Flow selection in the flow recording process

   As described in the previous section, because of lack of memory
   positions in the flow recording process some incoming packets might
   be discarded if they lead to the creation of a new flow record.
   However, under certain circumstances, it may be advantageous to
   discard an existing flow record during the flow recording process in
   order to make room for a new one which has been created upon arrival
   of a new packet.  For example, an algorithm to make the decision
   whether to discard a new incoming packet or an existing flow record

   is described in [Moli03].

   In this section we focus on the selection of the information to be
   stored regarding the record removal rather than on the details of the
   decision making algorithm.  For the reasons we mentioned above, it
   does not make sense to store separate information for each discarded
   flow record, as it would contradict the motivation why discarding is
   done (i.e. lack of memory resources).  The information that can be
   kept with a limited overhead is the cumulative counter of the total
   number of not yet exported packets and bytes belonging to flow
   records that were removed during the flow recording process.

   Ideally, we would like to keep also a timestamp for the first (T_fd)
   and last (T_ld) not yet exported packets belonging to every discarded
   flow record.  This would mean aggregating all these packets in a
   macro flow, and keeping track of its volume and duration.  To do so,
   we would need to maintain a timestamp of the first and last non-
   exported packets in each flow record.  The values of such timestamps
   would be checked whenever a record is discarded in order to verify
   whether they are smaller or larger than T_fd and T_ld, respectively.
   If so, the timestamps would be updated.

   Another information that can be easily maintained is the number of
   discarding actions, along with the timestamps of the first and last
   action.  This information SHOULD not be used by applications to re-
   normalize the received per flow statistics (because a flow may be
   discarded and created multiple times), but rather to monitor and
   control the performance of the implemented policy.  Note that we take
   into account a discarding event only when the discarded flow record
   contains data about traffic which has not been exported.
   Differently, the removal of a record whose traffic was exported
   (either after a timeout or after the arrival of specific packets,
   e.g.  TCP FIN or RST) is part of the normal operation of an IPFIX
   flow metering system.  Note also that we consider only the case when
   the elimination of a flow record during the flow recording process
   leads to the complete loss of all the information contained in the
   flow record itself.

   The implementation of a different policy, such as immediate exporting
   of the flow record before elimination, or freezing of the flow record
   and moving it to another area of memory for later exporting, is not
   considered as an elimination and therefore it is out of the scope of
   this document.

   Along with the information about the number of discarded flow records
   and associated packets and bytes, it is useful to keep cumulative
   information about the number of flow records containing not yet
   exported traffic and being currently handled by the flow recording

   process.  Another information worth keeping is the cumulative number
   of not exported packets and bytes contained in them.

4.3.  Flow selection during the exporting process

   The exporting process may implement policies for exporting only a
   subset of the flow records which have been stored in the system
   memory.  The decision to export only a subset of the flow records can
   be motivated by the existence of an explicit policy which filters out
   the flow records to be exported.  An example of such a policy could
   be to export only the flow records associated to flows whose
   accounted traffic is below a certain threshold, or to implement a
   more complex mechanism such as the one described in [DuLT01a] or
   [DuLT01b].

   Another motivation which might bring to the exporting of a subset of
   stored flow records is resource limitation.  For example, the
   exporting process has been assigned a limited time slot to operate or
   it exports only a predefined number of packets.  Hybrid cases can
   happen where the exporting of a subset of the flow records is
   motivated by the co-existence of resource limitations and ad-hoc
   policies which are applied in order to optimize the exporting
   process.  For example, given that the exporting process applies to a
   subset of the flow records, such subset is selected so that the
   overall number of exported packets and bytes belonging to the subset
   is maximized.

   Selecting flow records during the exporting process raises the issue
   of identifying the information which is worth keeping about the flow
   selection process.  Two different scenarios cab be envisaged.  If a
   flow record is not exported and then it does not feed the flow
   recording process, the scenario is the same as when the deletion of
   the flow record is caused by the need to make room to another record.
   The metrics to be kept are cumulative packets and bytes associated
   with non-exported flow records, timestamps of the first and last
   packets belonging to non-exported flow records, counter of dropping
   events and timestamps of first and last dropping event.

   If a record eligible for exporting is not exported and it enters the
   flow recording process it has a chance of being exported in the
   future.  It would be beneficial for an application to get
   information, in terms of number of generated packets and bytes, about
   the flow records which are not being exported due to the existence of
   exporting policies and/or resource limitations.  This is intended to
   make it possible to detect potential pathologic conditions, like the
   missed exporting of a large number of flow records and/or associated
   traffic, or the growing number of flow records being involved in the
   flow recording process.

   The selection of the flow records to be exported implies performing a
   complete scanning of the memory area where flow information is
   stored, thus jeopardizing the efficiency of the overall exporting
   process.  For this reason, flow exporting protocol specification does
   not include flow selection during the recording process as a
   mandatory function even if the information model has been designed to
   enable such function.


5.  Flow selection as a function of the IPFIX Mediator

   As shown in Figure 2, flow selection can be performed as an
   intermediate process within an IPFIX Mediator.  This process selects
   the flow records from a sequence which meets pre-defined criteria and
   exports them to an IPFIX Collector.  This selection function can be
   seen as a more fine-grained process with respect to the selection
   performed by an IPFIX Exporter.  The criteria used to drive the
   selection process at Mediator's level might be applied to the set of
   flow records coming from the IPFIX Exporter, thus triggering a
   further flow selection process.

       Figure 2: Flow selection as a function of the IPFIX Mediator

   As an example, if an IPFIX Mediator interacts with a set of IPFIX
   Collectors, flow records arriving at the IPFIX Mediator might be
   selected based on the IPFIX Collector requesting flow information.
   As described in previous sections, flow selection can take place
   during metering, recording, and exporting processes of an IPFIX
   exporter depending on the policies which are implemented to meet
   application requirements.  In case flow selection is performed at
   Mediator's level, we envisage the use of flow selection techniques as
   a step of the exporting process aimed to identify the flow records to
   be exported among those stored in the system's memory.  This is
   because the lighter is the intermediate selection process, the better

   is the performance of the mediation framework.


6.  Flow selection techniques

   We can distinguish the following selection techniques:

   1.  based on flow record content (i.e. all reported flow
       characteristics);

   2.  based on flow record arrival time;

   3.  based on external events like the exhaustion of local resources.

6.1.  Flow selection based on flow record content

   Flow selection can be done based on fields in an IPFIX flow record.
   This can be done similarly to field match filtering for packet
   selection described in [RFC5475].  The difference is that instead of
   packet fields flow record fields are here used to drive the selection
   decision.  An example would be to select flow records based on
   parameters like the flow size in bytes or the number of packets.
   Another application would be to select flow records based on either
   flow start time or flow keys (IP addresses, ports) of the stored flow
   record.

6.2.  Flow selection based on flow record arrival time or sequence

   Flow records can be selected based on their arrival time at the
   exporting process.  An example would be to select a number of flow
   records during certain time intervals.  Another option is to select
   flow records based on the order they arrive at the exporting process.
   In such case, one can either periodically select the k-th records or
   select randomly a set of flow records.

6.3.  Flow selection on external events

   The selection of flow records can be also triggered by external
   events.  An example would be to activate flow selection based on the
   value of a router state parameter like the number of entries in the
   flow cache.


7.  Information model for flow selection information exporting

   In this section we define the elements devoted to containing the
   information described in the previous sections.  Some elements have
   been associated with a pair of timestamps, which are referred to as



Peluso, et al.            Expires July 11, 2011                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          Flow Selection Techniques           January 2011


   element_nameTsFirst and element_nameTsLast.  We would like to point
   out that only packet or flow related counts have associated
   timestamps, while bytes related counts do not.  The reason is that
   element_nameTsFirst and element_nameTsLast are referred to the
   timestamp of the first and last received packets belonging to not
   exported flows, while timestamp is meanliness with regard to bytes
   information.

   Note that all the following information elements are aimed at
   describing macro flows parameters (e.g. the total number of packets
   and bytes contained in all dropped or not created flow records).
   Some of these macro flows parameters are additive, in the sense that
   it is only possible to add contributions to them, but never subtract
   some amount.  For example, the macro flow of the packets contained in
   flow records that are discarded from the flow reporting process
   receives an addition when a flow record is discarded, and this
   addition can never be subtracted.  On the other side, some macro flow
   parameters can dynamically receive and loose additions.  For example,
   the macro flows of packets not yet exported receives an addition when
   a new packet arrives, and looses addition as an exporting event takes
   place.  Associating a timestamp to the oldest and most recent
   additions in case of additive flows is an easy task, while it is
   complicated for the others (it would require to maintain full state
   information) and that is why we did not define timestamps for these
   information elements.

   The information elements herein introduced are defined in accordance
   with the IPFIX information model [RFC5102].  Furthermore, the data
   types used to represent the Flow Selection-related information
   elements are those defined in section 3.1 of the IPFIX information
   model [RFC5102].

8.  Implementation requirements

   In order to implement the described information model counters for
   non-exported packets and bytes have to be inserted in the flow
   records as flow metrics.  Sometimes these counters are referred to as
   delta counts.  An implementation may also keep absolute counts for
   purposes not being specified in this information model (both delta
   and absolute counters can be exported in the IPFIX information model,
   see [RFC5102]).  In addition, to fully support this information
   model, it would be REQUIRED to keep in a flow record the timestamps
   of the first and last non-exported packets.  An implementation may
   need to keep timestamps of the first and last exported packets for
   other purposes than those of this information model, or to join the
   two timers for the last exported and first exported packets, or even
   to approximate them with the time of the exporting event.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces several new information elements as an
   extension to the IPFIX information model.  Values TBD1-TBD19 in this
   document should be replaced with the assigned numbers by IANA.


11.  Security Considerations

   In this section security issues concerning an IPFIX device performing
   flow selection are pointed out.  In case the flow selection function
   is activated an IPFIX device might be exposed to security threats.
   Since flow selection implies analysing flow packets, associating them
   to a specific traffic flow and selecting flow records, a malicious
   user who was able to gain control of an IPFIX device might access
   both packet and flow data, thus violating their confidentiality.

   Furthermore, the intruder might be attracted by the possibility of
   altering the flow selection process by modifying the criteria used to
   select flow records.  In this case, the IPFIX device would export
   flow data which are different from the ones that the Collector
   expects to receive.

   It is apparent that these security threats can be mitigated by
   authenticating entities that interact with the IPFIX device and
   keeping information for flow selection configuration confidential.
