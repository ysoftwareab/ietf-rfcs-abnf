Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Renewal Information
                            (ARI) Extension
                        draft-aaron-acme-ari-00

Abstract

   This document specifies how an ACME server may provide hints to ACME
   clients as to when they should attempt to renew their certificates.
   This allows servers to mitigate load spikes, and ensures clients do
   not make false assumptions about appropriate certificate renewal
   periods.

1.  Introduction

   Most ACME clients today choose when to attempt to renew a certificate
   in one of three ways.  They may be configured to renew at a specific
   interval (e.g. via "cron"); they may parse the issued certificate to
   determine its expiration date and renew a specific amount of time
   before then; or they may parse the issued certificate and renew when
   some percentage of its validity period has passed.  The first two
   techniques create significant barriers against the issuing CA
   changing certificate lifetimes.  All three techniques lead to load
   clustering for the issuing CA.

   Being able to indicate to the client a period in which the issuing CA
   suggests renewal would allow both dynamic changes to the certificate
   validity period and proactive smearing of load.  This document
   specifies a mechanism by which ACME servers may provide suggested
   renewal windows to ACME clients.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Extensions to the ACME Protocol: The "order" Resource

   An ACME server which wishes to provide renewal information MUST
   include a new field, "renewalInfo", in finalized Order objects.

   renewalInfo (optional, string): A URL for renewal information for the
   certificate that has been issued in response to this order.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "status": "valid",
     "expires": "2021-01-20T14:09:07.99Z",

     "identifiers": [
       { "type": "dns", "value": "www.example.org" },
       { "type": "dns", "value": "example.org" }
     ],

     "notBefore": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
     "notAfter": "2021-01-08T00:00:00Z",

     "authorizations": [
       "https://example.com/acme/authz/PAniVnsZcis",
       "https://example.com/acme/authz/r4HqLzrSrpI"
     ],

     "finalize": "https://example.com/acme/order/TOlocE8rfgo/finalize",
     "certificate": "https://example.com/acme/cert/mAt3xBGaobw",
     "renewalInfo": "https://example.com/acme/renewal/eXoM9UwLgbL"
   }

   Conforming clients SHOULD store the "renewalInfo" URL locally so that
   they can poll it at any time during the lifetime of the certificate.

4.  Extensions to the ACME Protocol: The "renewalInfo" Resource

   We define a new resource type, the "renewalInfo" resource, as part of
   the ACME protocol.

Internet-Draft                  ACME ARI                  September 2021


   The structure of an ACME renewalInfo resource is as follows:

   suggestedWindow (object, required): A JSON object with two keys,
   "start" and "end", whose values are timestamps, encoded in the format
   specified in [RFC3339], which bound the window of time in which the
   CA recommends renewing the certificate.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "suggestedWindow": {
       "start": "2021-01-03T00:00:00Z",
       "end": "2021-01-07T00:00:00Z"
     }
   }

   Conforming servers MUST provide the renewalInfo resource via POST-as-
   GET; they SHOULD provide it via unauthenticated GET as well.
   Conforming clients SHOULD use unauthenticated GET to request
   renewalInfo resources.

   The server SHOULD include a Retry-After header indicating the polling
   interval that the ACME server recommends.  Conforming clients SHOULD
   query the "renewalInfo" URL again after the Retry-After period has
   passed, as the server may provide a different suggestedWindow.

   Conforming clients SHOULD select a random time within the suggested
   window to attempt to renew the certificate.  If the selected time is
   in the past, the client SHOULD attempt renewal immediately.

5.  Security Considerations

   The extensions to the ACME protocol described in this document build
   upon the Security Considerations and threat model defined in
   Section 10.1 of [RFC8555].

   This document specifies that renewalInfo resources should be exposed
   via unauthenticated GET requests, a departure from RFC8555's
   requirement that clients must send POST-as-GET requests to fetch
   resources from the server.  This is because the information contained
   in renewalInfo resources is not considered confidential, and because
   allowing renewalInfo to be easily cached is advantageous to shed load
   from clients which do not respect the Retry-After header.

6.  IANA Considerations

   Draft note: The following changes to IANA registries have not yet
   been made.

6.1.  New Registries

   Within the "Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
   Protocol" registry, IANA has created the new "ACME Renewal Info
   Object Fields" registry (Section 6.4).

6.2.  ACME Resource Type

   Within the "Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME)
   Protocol" registry, the following entry has been added to the "ACME
   Resource Types" registry.

            +=============+=====================+============+
            | Field Name  | Resource Type       | Reference  |

   Template:

   *  Field name: The string to be used as a field name in the JSON
      object
