  Generic YANG-related System Capabilities and YANG-Push Notification
                              Capabilities
            draft-ietf-netconf-notification-capabilities-09

Abstract

   This document proposes two YANG modules.  The module ietf-system-
   capabilities provides a structure that can be used to specify any
   YANG related system capability.

   The module ietf-notification-capabilities allows a publisher to
   specify capabilities related to "Subscription to YANG Datastores"
   (YANG-Push).  It proposes to use YANG Instance Data to document this
   information and make it already available at implementation-time, but
   also allow it to be reported at run-time.

Internet-Draft     YANG-Push Notification Capabilities      January 2020


   On-change Notification Capability: The capability of the publisher to
   send on-change notifications for a specific datastore or a specific
   data node.

   Implementation-time information: Information about the publisher's or
   server's behavior that is made available during the implementation of
   the publisher/server, available from a source other then a running
   server.

   Run-time information: Information about the publisher's or server's
   behavior that is available from the running server via management
   protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].

2.  Introduction

   Systems implementing a server and/or a publisher often have
   capabilities that are not defined by the YANG model itself.  There is
   a need to publish this capability information as it part of the
   contract between the server and client.  Examples include: maximum
   size of data that can be stored or transferred, information about
   counters (whether a node supports on-change telemetry), etc.  Such
   capabilities are often dependent on a vendor's implementation or the
   available resources at deployment.  Many such capabilities are
   specific to either the complete system, individual YANG datastores or
   specific parts of the YANG schema, or even to individual data nodes.
   It is a goal of this document to provide a common way of representing
   such capabilities in a format that is:

   o  vendor independent

   o  machine readable

   o  available in identical format both in implementation-time and run-
      time

2.1.  YANG-Push Notification Capabilities

   A specific case where we need to specify capabilities is the YANG-
   Push functionality.  As defined in [RFC8641] a publisher may allow
   subscribers to subscribe to updates from a datastore and subsequently
   push such update notifications to the receiver.  Notifications may be
   sent periodically or on-change (more or less immediately after each
   change).

   A publisher supporting YANG-Push has a number of capabilities defined
   in [RFC8641] that are often determined during the implementation of
   the publisher.  These include:




Lengyel, et al.           Expires July 10, 2020                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     YANG-Push Notification Capabilities      January 2020


   o  Supported (reporting) periods for periodic subscriptions

   o  Maximum number of objects that can be sent in an update

   o  The set of datastores or data nodes for which periodic
      notification is supported

   Additional capabilities if the optional on-change feature is
   supported include:

   o  Supported dampening periods for on-change subscriptions

   o  The set of datastores or data nodes for which on-change
      notification is supported

   Publishers have limitations in how many update notifications and how
   many datastore node updates they can send out in a certain time-
   period.

   Publishers might not support periodic subscriptions to all
   datastores.

   In some cases, a publisher supporting on-change notifications will
   not be able to push updates for some object types on-change.  Reasons
   for this might be that the value of the datastore node changes
   frequently (e.g., in-octets counter), that small object changes are
   frequent and irrelevant to the receiver (e.g., a temperature gauge
   changing 0.1 degrees within a predetermined and acceptable range), or
   that the implementation is not capable of on-change notification for
   a particular object.  In those cases, it will be important for
   subscriber applications to have a way to identify which objects on-
   change notifications are supported and for which ones not.

   Faced with the reality that support for on-change notification does
   not mean that such notifications will be sent for any specific data
   node, subscriber/management applications can not rely on the on-
   change functionality unless the subscriber has some means to identify
   which objects on-change notifications are supported.  YANG models are
   meant to be used as an interface contract.  Without identification of
   the data nodes actually supporting on-change, this contract would be
   incomplete.

   Clients of a server, subscribers to a publisher need a method to
   gather capability information.

   Implementation-time information is needed by Network Management
   System (NMS) implementers.  A NMS implementation that wants to
   support notifications, needs the information about on-change



Lengyel, et al.           Expires July 10, 2020                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     YANG-Push Notification Capabilities      January 2020


   notification capability.  If the information is not documented in a
   way available to the NMS designer, but only as instance data from the
   network node once it is deployed, the NMS implementation will be
   delayed, because it has to wait for the network node to be ready.  In
   addition, the assumption that all NMS implementers will have a
   correctly configured network node available to retrieve data from is
   an expensive proposition and may not always hold.  (An NMS may need
   to be able to handle many dozens of network node types.)  Often a
   fully functional NMS is a requirement for introducing a new network
   node type into a network, so delaying NMS readiness effectively also
   delays the time at which a new network node type can be introduced
   into the network.

   Implementation-time information is needed by system integrators.
   When introducing a network node type into their network, operators
   often need to integrate the node type into their own management
   system.  The NMS may have management functions that depend on on-
   change notifications.  The network operator needs to plan his
   management practices and NMS implementation before he even decides to
   buy the specific network node type.  Moreover the decision to buy the
   node type sometimes depends on these management possibilities.

   Run-time information is needed:

   o  for any "purely model driven" application, e.g., a NETCONF-
      browser.  Such applications depend on reading models and
      capabilities in run-time to support all the publisher's available
      functionality.

   o  in case the capability might change during run-time e.g., due to
      licensing, HW constraints etc.

   o  to check that capability information provided early, already in
      implementation-time is indeed what the publisher implements (is
      the supplied documentation correct?)

3.  Providing System Capability Information

   Capability information is represented by instance-data based on one
   or more "capability defining YANG modules".  This allows a user to
   discover capabilities both at implementation-time and run-time.

   o  For the implementation-time use-case: Capabilities SHOULD be
      provided by the implementer as YANG instance data files complying
      to [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-instance-file-format].  The file SHALL be
      available already in implementation-time retrievable in a way that
      does not depend on a live network node.  E.g., download from
      product website.

Internet-Draft     YANG-Push Notification Capabilities      January 2020


   o  For the run-time use-case: Capabilities SHOULD be available via
      NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040] from the live server
      (implementing the publisher) during run-time.  Implementations
      which support changing these capabilities at run-time SHOULD
      support on-change notifications about the system-capabilities
      container.

   The module ietf-system-capabilities is defined to provide a structure
   that can be used to specify any YANG related system capability.

   The module ietf-notification-capabilities is defined to allow a
   publisher to specify capabilities related to "Subscription to YANG
   Datastores" (YANG-Push) augmenting ietf-system-capabilities.

4.  System Capabilities Model

   The module ietf-system-capabilities is defined to provide a structure
   that can be used to specify any YANG related system capability.

   Capability values can be specified on system/publisher level,
   datastore level or for specific data nodes (and their contained sub-
   tree) of a specific datastore.  Capability values on a smaller, more
   specific part of the system's data always override more generic
   values.

   This module itself does not contain any capabilities.  It SHOULD be
   used by other modules to augment-in specific capability information.
   Every set of such capabilities SHOULD be wrapped in a container under
   the augment statement to cleanly separate different groups of
   capabilities.  These "wrapper containers" SHALL be augmented in at
   /sysc:system-capabilities and /sysc:system-capabilities/
   sysc:datastore-capabilities/sysc:per-node-capabilities.

   Note: The solution is usable for both NMDA and non-NMDA systems.  For
   non-NMDA servers/publishers config=false data is considered as if it
   was part of the running datastore.

      If a capability is specified on multiple levels, the
      specification on a more specific level overrides more
      generic capability specifications; thus
      - a system level specification is overridden by any
      other specification

      - a datastore level specification (with a node-selector '/') is
      overridden by a specification with a more specific node-selector.
      - a specification for a specific datastore and node-selector
      is overridden by a specification for the same datastore with
      a node-selector that describes more levels of containing lists
      and containers.
      It is not allowed to have multiple node selectors which
      - are defined for the same datastore AND
      - have the same number of containment levels AND
      - select an overlapping set of nodes.

      To find a capability value for a specific data node in a
      specific datastore the user SHALL
      1) consider the system level capabilities under the
      system-capabilities container if the
      capability value is specified.
      2) search for a datastore-capabilities list entry for
      the specific datastore.
      3) within that datastore entry search for a
      per-node-capabilities entry that specifies the specific
      capability and that has the node-selector selecting the
      specific data node and that specifies the most levels of
      containing containers and lists.
      4) If no entries are found in the previous steps the
      publisher is not capable of providing a value because
      it is unknown, the capability is changing for some reason,
      there is no specified limit etc. In this case the
      system's behavior is unspecified.

  description
    "This module specifies YANG-Push related publisher capabilities.

     The module contains
     - specification of which data nodes support on-change or periodic
     notifications.
     - capabilities related to the throughput of notification data the
     publisher can support. (Note that for a specific subscription
     the publisher MAY still allow only longer periods or smaller
     updates depending on e.g., actual load conditions.)

     Capability values can be specified on system/publisher level,
     datastore level or for specific data nodes (and their contained
     sub-tree) of a specific datastore, as defined in the
     ietf-system-capabilities module.

     If, different data nodes covered by a single subscription
     have different values for a specific capability, then using values
     that are only acceptable for some of these data nodes, but not for
     others, may result in the rejection of the subscription.

     The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL',
     'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED',
     'NOT RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document
     are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119)
     (RFC 8174) when, and only when, they appear in all
     capitals, as shown here.

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document define a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   All protocol-accessible data nodes are read-only and cannot be
   modified.  The data in these modules is not security sensitive.
   Access control may be configured, to avoid exposing the read-only
   data.

   When that data is in file format, data should be protected against
   modification or unauthorized access using normal file handling
   mechanisms.

7.  IANA Considerations

Appendix A.  Instance data examples

   The following example is instance-data describing the notification
   capabilities of a hypothetical "acme-switch".  The switch implements
   the running, candidate and operational datastores.  Every change can
   be reported on-change from running, nothing from candidate and all
   config=false data from operational.  Periodic subscriptions are
   supported for running and operational, but not for candidate.

     Figure 1: Notification Capabilities with datastore level settings

   The following is the instance-data describing the notification
   capabilities of a hypothetical "acme-router".  The router implements
   the running, and operational datastores.  Every change can be
   reported on-change from running, but only config=true nodes and some
   config=false data from operational.  Interface statistics are not
   reported on-change only 2 important counters.  Datastore subscription
   capabilities are not reported on-change as they never change on the
   acme-router during run-time.

Appendix B.  Changes between revisions

   v08 - v09

   o  Split the YANG module into two: ietf-system-capabilities and ietf-
      notification-capabilities.  Restructured/updated the draft
      accordingly.

   v07 - v08

   o  Prepared the YANG model to include other non-YANG-Push related
      capabilities.

   o  Renamed the top level container to system-capabilities

   o  Added a container subscription-capabilities to the grouping
      subscription-capabilities to contain all subscription related
      capabilities

   o  Updated examples according to draft-ietf-netmod-yang-instance-
      file-format-06.

   v06 - v07

   o  Updated examples according to draft-ietf-netmod-yang-instance-
      file-format-05.

   v05 - v06

   o  Providing the capability data is only a "SHOULD" recommendation.
      Some reviewers wanted MUST some wanted much less.

Internet-Draft     YANG-Push Notification Capabilities      January 2020


   o  The YANG module import statements now indicate the imported
      modules that must be implemented not just available as import as
      requested by the YangDoctors review.

   v04 - v05

   o  Added new capabilities periodic-notifications-supported and
      supported-excluded-change-type.

   o  Restructured YANG module to make the node-selector's usage similar
      to how NACM uses it: "/" means the whole datastore.

   o  Small corrections, spelling, rewording

   o  Replaced the term server with the term publisher except in cases
      where we speak about datastores and functionality based on get,
      getconfig operations.  In this latter case it is really the server
      functionality that is discussed

   v03 - v04

   o  Clarified recommended support for on-change notifications about
      the datastore-subscription-capabilities.

   v02 - v03

   o  Allow throughput related capabilities to be defined on top,
      datastore or data node level.  Described that specific capability
      values always override generic ones.

   o  Indicate that non-NMDA servers can also use this model.

   o  Updated according to draft-ietf-netmod-yang-instance-file-
      format-04

   v01 - v02

   o  Added instance data examples

   o  On-change capability can be defined per datastore

   o  Added "if-feature yp:on-change" where relevant

   o  Unified units used

   v00 - v01

   o  Add more capabilities: minimum period, supported period max-number
      of objects, min dampening period, dampening supported
