Abstract

   The purpose of this draft is to add terminology specific to the 
   benchmarking of multicast IP forwarding devices. It builds upon the 
   tenets set forth in RFC 1242, RFC 1944, and other IETF 
   Benchmark Methodology Working Group (BMWG) effort and extends 
   them to the multicast paradigm.  

   [While primarily directed towards intermediate IP multicast 
   forwarding devices on LANs, elements of this text may or may not be
   applicable to other media as well.]

1.  Introduction

   Network forwarding devices are being required to take a single
   frame and support delivery to a number of destinations having 
   membership to a particular group. As such, multicast support may 
   place a different burden on the resources of these network 
   forwarding devices than with unicast or broadcast traffic types.

   By clearly identifying benchmarks and related terminology in this
   document, it is hoped that detailed methodologies can be generated 
   in subsequent documents.  Taken in tandem, these two efforts 
   endeavor to assist the clinical, empirical, and consistent 
   characterization of certain aspects of multicast technologies and 
   their individual implementations.

2.1 Existing Terminology

   This document draws on existing terminology defined in other
   BMWG work.  Examples include, but are not limited to:

   Throughput (RFC 1242, section 3.17)
   Latency (RFC 1242,  section 3.8)
   Constant Load (RFC 1242, section 3.4)

3.  Term Definitions

   This section will present the terminology to be defined in
   this document.


3.1 Device Under Test (DUT).
 
   Definition: 
     The network forwarding device being tested.

   Discussion:
 
   Measurement units:
      Not applicable.
 

3.2 System Under Test (SUT).
 
   Definition: 
     The collective set of network devices being tested as a singular 
     entity.	
 
   Discussion: A system under test may be comprised of a variety
     of networking devices.  Some devices may be active in the
     forwarding decision making process, such as routers or switches;
     other devices may be passive such as CSU/DSUs.  Regardless
     of constituent components, the system is treated as a "black box"
     to which stimuli is offered and response measured.  

   Measurement units:
      Not applicable.

 
3.3 Target Rate.
 
   Definition: 
     The requested rate at which the test device attempts to offer the 
     DUT or SUT test traffic.
 
   Discussion:
     There are networks events (e.g., collisions) that may preclude the
     test device from delivering the requested rate to the SUT. In this
     case, differentiation is made between target rate and offered rate.

     [May need to be reconciled with terminology of BMWG works-in-
     progress.]

   Measurement units:
     Frames per second. 
 

3.4 Offered Rate.
 
   Definition: 
     The actual resultant rate at which the test device is successful 
     in offering test traffic to the SUT.
     

Dubray, K.             Expires May 1997                      [Page 3]

   Discussion:
     Contrast with Target Rate. Note relationship to Forwarding Rate.

     [May need to be reconciled with terminology of BMWG works-in-
     progress.]
 
   Measurement units:
     Frames per second.
 

3.5 Forwarding Rate.
 
   Definition: 
     The rate at which the SUT has been observed to successfully 
     forward test traffic to the traffic's correct destination(s) in
     response to a particular offered rate.
 
   Discussion:
     Note the specification of "correct destination(s)" in the
     definition.  The reporting of a forwarding rate MUST 
     correspond to an associated Offered Rate.  Frame loss is not
     a constraint when reporting Forwarding Rate.
 
     [May need to be reconciled with terminology of BMWG works-in-
     progress.]

   Measurement units:
     Frames per second.
 

3.6 Maximum Forwarding Rate (MFR).
 
   Definition: 
     The rate at which the SUT has been observed to successfully 
     forward test traffic to the traffic's correct destination(s) in
     response to the test device's maximum offered rate.
     
   Discussion:
     Because a DUT's maximum forwarding rate does not always equal 
     the largest forwarding rate of the DUT, this metric can sometimes 
     indicate oversubscription or congestion internal to the DUT/SUT.  
     For example, consider the following table:

              Test Device             DUT
             Offered  Rate      Forwarding Rate 
             -------------      ---------------
           1.  14,880 fps           7,400 fps
           2.  13,880 fps           8,472 fps
           3.  12,880 fps          12,880 fps


Dubray, K.             Expires May 1997                      [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT     Multicast Benchmarking Terminology    November 1996


     The tester's maximum offered rate is 14,880 frames per second,
     as indicated in line 1. Per the definition, the corresponding 
     MFR for the DUT is 7,440 fps - not the 12,880 fps indicated in
     line 3.    

     When reporting the MFR, the corresponding test device's maximum
     offered load MUST be cited.  This is due to the fact that not
     all test devices deliver the maximum usable bandwidth.  In the
     case when the test device is able to exceed the maximum, legal 
     bandwidth, the test results SHOULD reflect that the test was 
     conducted in a overload condition.

   Measurement units:
     Frames per second.
 

3.7 Flow.
 
   Definition: 
     An equivalence class of packets comprising one or more data 
     streams.
 
   Discussion:
     In the scope of this document, Flow will be considered a logical 
     identifier used to discriminate between a set or sets of packets 
     offered the DUT. 

     For example, one flow may identify a set of unicast packets 
     offered to the DUT.  Another flow may differentiate the
     multicast packets destined to multicast group X. Yet another
     flow may distinguish the set of multicast packets destined to
     multicast group Y.

   Measurement units:
     Not applicable.
 
 
3.8 Group Flow.
 
   Definition:
     A specific type of flow where the packets comprising the flow 
     are destined to a particular multicast group.
 
   Discussion:
     
   Measurement units:
     Not applicable.

INTERNET-DRAFT     Multicast Benchmarking Terminology    November 1996


3.9 Service Flow.
 
   Definition:
     A specific type of flow where the packets comprising the flow 
     require particular treatment or treatments by the network 
     forwarding devices along the path to the packets' destination(s).

   Discussion:
 
   Measurement units:
     Not applicable.
 

3.10 Mixed Throughput (MT).

   Definition:
     The maximum rate at which none of the offered frames, comprised
     from a unicast flow and a multicast flow, to be forwarded are 
     dropped by the device.

   Discussion:
     Often times, throughput is collected on a homogenous traffic 
     type - though the packets' destinations may vary, the packets
     follow the same packet forwarding path through the DUT.

     Based on the RFC 1242 definition for throughput, the Mixed
     Thoughput benchmark attempts to characterize the DUT's 
     ability to process both unicast and multicast frames in the
     same aggregated traffic stream.

   Measurement units:
     Frames per second

 
3.11 Scaled Group Throughput (SGT). 
 
   Definition: 
     The maximum number of multicast groups that a DUT/SUT can
     support and still yield the same throughput as supporting a 
     single multicast group.
 
   Discussion:
     A desirable attribute of many Internet mechanisms is the ability 
     to "scale." This benchmark seeks to demonstrate the ability 
     of a SUT to scale the number of multicast groups upwards while
     holding it to the RFC 1242 definition of throughput for a single
     multicast group.

   Measurement units:
     Number of multicast groups.

3.12 Extraction Throughput (ET)

 Definition:
     The maximum rate at which none of the frames offered in an
     transitional format to the SUT are dropped in the process of
     converting those frames to their appropriate, final format and
     subsequent correct delivery.
 
   Discussion:
     A popular technique in presenting frames to devices that may
     not support a protocol feature is to encapsulate, or tunnel,
     the packet containing the unsupported feature in a format that 
     is supported by that device.  This benchmark attempts to 
     characterize the overhead behavior associated with that
     transitional process. 

     Consideration may need to be given with respect to the impact
     of different frame formats on usable bandwidth.
 
   Measurement units:
     Frames per second.
 

3.13 Fairness.
 
   Definition: 
     The ability of a SUT to fulfill the requirements of a flow
     without compromising the requirements, if any, of other flows. 
 
   Discussion:
     
   Measurement units:
     Not applicable.
 

3.14 Multicast Latency.
 
   Definition: 
     The set of individual latencies from a single input port on
     the DUT or SUT to all tested ports belonging to the destination
     multicast group. 
 
   Discussion:
     This benchmark is based on the RFC 1242 definition of latency. 
     While it is useful to collect latency between a pair of source 
     and destination multicast ports, it may be insightful to collect 
     the same type of measurements across a range of ports supporting
     that group flow.

     A variety of statistical exercises can be applied to the set of
     latencies measurements.
 
   Measurement units:
     Time units with enough precision to reflect measurement.

INTERNET-DRAFT     Multicast Benchmarking Terminology    November 1996


3.15 Min/Max Latency.
 
   Definition: 
     The difference between the maximum latency measurement and the
     minimum latency measurement from the set of latencies produced by
     the Multicast Latency benchmark.
 
   Discussion:
     This statistic may yield some insight into how a particular
     implementation handles its multicast traffic.  This may be useful
     to users of multicast synchronization types of applications.
 
   Measurement units:
     Time units with enough precision to reflect measurement.

 
3.16 Prune Delay.
 
   Definition: 
     The time duration it takes a DUT/SUT to cease forwarding multicast
     packets after a corresponding "prune" or similar event has been 
     successfully generated.
 
   Discussion:
     While it is important to understand how quickly a system can
     process multicast frames; it may be beneficial to understand
     how quickly that same system can stop the process as well.
 
   Measurement units:
     Microseconds.

 
3.16 Group Membership Delay.
 
   Definition: 
     The time duration it takes a DUT/SUT to start forwarding multicast
     packets from the time a successful IGMP group membership report has
     been generated.
 
   Discussion:
     Many different factors can contribute to different results, such as
     the number or type of multicast-related protocols configured
     on the system under test.     
 
     A consideration for the related methodology:  possible need to
     differentiate a specifically-forwarded multicast frame from those
     sprayed by protocols implementing a flooding tactic to solicit prune 
     feedback.

   Measurement units:
     Microseconds.

3.17 Multicast Group Capacity.
 
   Definition: 
     The maximum number of multicast groups a SUT/DUT can support
     while maintaining the ability to forward multicast frames 
     to all multicast groups registered to that SUT/DUT.
 
   Discussion:
     
   Measurement units:
     Multicast groups.

 
3.18 Aggregated Multicast Throughput (AMT)

   Definition: 
     The maximum rate at which none of the offered frames to be 
     forwarded through N destination interfaces of the same multicast
     group are dropped.
 
   Discussion:
     Another "scaling" type of exercise, designed to identify the 
     DUT/SUT's ability to handle traffic as a function of the 
     multicast destination ports it is required to support.
     
   Measurement units:
     The ordered pair (N,t) where, 
       
        N = the number of destination ports of the multicast group.
        t = the throughput, in frames per second, relative to the 
            source stream.
