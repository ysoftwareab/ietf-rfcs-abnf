Internet-Draft          Decision for Mip type               February 2006


Abstract

   Currently, this comes from the policy associated with that mobile.
   But a MS maybe has the MIP capability.We need a flag to know if a 
   MS need Proxy MIP capability.This document explains how we can 
   define a flag in dhcp option to state that a MS wish or doesn't
   wish to have the Proxy MIP capability.

Internet-Draft          Decision for Mip type               February 2006


1.  Introduction

   Currently in some standards development organizations(SDO) some 
   simple IP terminal need to be implemented the MIP cability. That is
   finished by network without the MS's mobility support. That is named
   as PMIP(proxy MIP). But if all of the simple IP terminal should be 
   provided with the PMIP by PMIP-enabled network? Or if MIP-enabled
   terminal can also have the PMIP support by PMIP-enabled network?

   These requirements are needed to be defined.

   This document defines a flag in dhcp option to indicate if a MS wish 
   to have the Proxy MIP support.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 RFC 2119
   [STANDARDS].

2.  Overview

   Network decide a MS need the proxy MIP is triggered by 
   some entry network progress, such as PPP,DHCP,ND etc.
 
   Currently, PPP has a option to indicate the mobile
   capability of a MS(simple IP or mobile IP). But others 
   didn't have.If we think it right, we should do this.

3.  Implementation

   When a MS  entry into network,it utilizes some protocols to acquire 
   initial network argument.Those protocols maybe PPP/DHCP/ND etc.

   We can indicate the capability of the mobility preference of this MS.
   Then network can decide if need to do the proxy MIP for this MS.

   Currently, PPP has defined this option.
   How about DHCP / ND and others? also need ,right?

4.  A example :use DHCP protocol to inform the mip type of MS
   
   In DHCP protocol, we definedd a new option to indicate that if a MS
   need the proxy MIP capability.

   This flag should be used in both of stateless DHCP protocol or 
   stateful DHCP protocol.

   This flag should be used in both of DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 protocols.

5.  Security Considerations

   Secure guarante1 can utilize the detail protocol defination.

6.  Conclusions

   We need let MS has the ability to inform network about it's capability 
   in the selection of mobility mechnism.
