                 draft-ietf-imapapnd-rfc2088bis-03.txt

Abstract

   The Internet Message Access Protocol (RFC 3501) contains the
   "literal" syntactic construct for communicating strings.  When
   sending a literal from client to server, IMAP requires the client to
   wait for the server to send a command continuation request between
   sending the octet count and the string data.  This document specifies
   an alternate form of literal that does not require this network round
   trip.

   This document specifies 2 IMAP extensions: LITERAL+ and LITERAL-.
   LITERAL+ allows the alternate form of literals in all IMAP commands.
   LITERAL- is the same as LITERAL+, but disallows the alternate form of
   literals unless they are 4096 bytes or less.

   This document obsoletes RFC 2088.

Internet-Draft      IMAP4 non-synchronizing literals          March 2016


1.  Introduction

   The Internet Message Access Protocol (RFC 3501) contains the
   "literal" syntactic construct for communicating strings.  When
   sending a literal from client to server, IMAP requires the client to
   wait for the server to send a command continuation request between
   sending the octet count and the string data.  This document specifies
   an alternate form of literal that does not require this network round
   trip.

   This document specifies 2 IMAP extensions: LITERAL+ and LITERAL-.
   LITERAL+ allows the alternate form of literals (called "non-
   synchronized literals" below) in all IMAP commands.  LITERAL- is the
   same as LITERAL+, but disallows the alternate form of literals unless
   they are 4096 bytes or less.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

3.  Specification

   The non-synchronizing literal is added as an alternate form of
   literal, and may appear in communication from client to server
   instead of the IMAP [RFC3501] form of literal.  The IMAP form of
   literal, used in communication from client to server, is referred to
   as a synchronizing literal.  The non-synchronizing literal form MUST
   NOT be sent from server to client.

   Non-synchronizing literals may be used with any IMAP server
   implementation that returns "LITERAL+" or "LITERAL-" as one of the
   supported capabilities to the CAPABILITY command.  If the server does
   not advertise either of the above capabilities, the client must use
   synchronizing literals instead.  The difference between "LITERAL+"
   and "LITERAL-" extensions is explained in Section 5.

   The non-synchronizing literal is distinguished from the original
   synchronizing literal by having a plus ('+') between the octet count
   and the closing brace ('}').  The server does not generate a command
   continuation request in response to a non-synchronizing literal, and

   clients are not required to wait before sending the octets of a non-
   synchronizing literal.

   The protocol receiver of an IMAP server must check the end of every
   received line (a sequence of octets that end with a CRLF) for an open
   brace ('{') followed by an octet count, a plus ('+'), and a close
   brace ('}') immediately preceeding the CRLF.  If it finds this
   sequence, it is the octet count of a non-synchronizing literal and
   the server MUST treat the specified number of following octets and
   the following line as part of the same command.  A server MAY still
   process commands and reject errors on a line-by-line basis, as long
   as it checks for non-synchronizing literals at the end of each line.

   Example:

   C: A001 LOGIN {11+}
   C: FRED FOOBAR {7+}
   C: fat man
   S: A001 OK LOGIN completed

4.  Considerations on when to use and not to use synchronizing literals

   This section is important to understand for both client and server
   developers of this IMAP extension.

   While non-synchronizing literals have clear advantages for clients,
   such as simplicity of use, they might be more difficult to handle on
   the server side.  When a client uses a non-synchronizing literal that
   is too big for the server to accept, a compliant LITERAL+ server
   implementation has to make a choice between several non-optimal
   choices:

   1.  Read the number of bytes specified in the non-synchronizing
       literal and reject the command that included the literal anyway.
       (The server is allowed to send the tagged BAD/NO response before
       reading the whole non-synchronizing literal.)  This is quite
       wasteful on bandwidth if the literal is large.

   2.  Send an untagged BYE response explaining the reason for rejecting
       the literal (possibly accompanied by an ALERT response code in
       another response) and close the connection.  This will force the
       client to reconnect or report the error to the user.  In the
       latter case the error is unlikely to be understandable to the
       user.  Additionally, some naive clients are known to blindly
       reconnect in this case and repeat the operation that caused the
       problem, introducing an infinite loop.

   The problem described above is most common when using the APPEND
   command, because most of commands don't need to send lots of data
   from the client to the server.  Some server implementations impose
   limits on literals (both synchronizing and non-synchronizing)
   accepted from clients in order to defend against Denial Of Service
   attacks.  Implementations can generally impose much lower limits on
   literal sizes for all commands other than APPEND.  In order to
   address literal size issue in APPEND, this document introduces a new
   extension "LITERAL-", described in Section 5.

   The situation can also be improved by implementing support for the
   APPENDLIMIT extension [APPENDLIMIT], which allows a server to
   advertise its APPEND limit, so that well behaved clients can check it
   and avoid uploading big messages in the first place.

5.  LITERAL- capability

   The "LITERAL-" extension is almost identical to "LITERAL+", with one
   exception: when "LITERAL-" is advertised, non-synchronizing literals
   used in any command MUST NOT be larger than 4096 bytes.  Any literal
   larger than 4096 bytes MUST be sent as an RFC 3501 synchronizing
   literal.  A "LITERAL-" compliant server that encounters a non-
   synchronizing literal in APPEND larger than 4096 bytes MUST reject
   such APPEND command with a tagged BAD response that contains the
   TOOBIG response code [RFC4469].  It then MAY proceed as described in
   Section 4.

   Because "LITERAL-" is a more restricted version of "LITERAL+", IMAP
   servers MUST NOT advertise both of these capabilities at the same
   time.  (A server implementation can choose to have a configuration
   option to pick which one to advertise.)

6.  Interaction with BINARY extension

   RFC 4466 [RFC4466] updated the non-terminal "literal8" defined in
   [RFC3516] to allow for non-synchronizing literals if both [RFC3516]
   and "LITERAL+" extensions are supported by the server.

   This document also allows use of this extended "literal8" syntax when
   both [RFC3516] and "LITERAL-" extensions are supported by the server.

7.  Interaction with MULTIAPPEND extension

   RFC 3502 [RFC3502] describes MULTIAPPEND extension and how it can be
   used with LITERAL+.  The LITERAL- extension can be used with the
   MULTIAPPEND extension in the same way.

8.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF].

   Non-terminals referenced but not defined below are as defined by
   [RFC3501].

     literal = "{" number ["+"] "}" CRLF *CHAR8
                ; Number represents the number of CHAR8 octets

     CHAR8   = <defined in RFC 3501>

     literal8 = <defined in RFC 4466>

9.  Security Considerations

   Use of non-synchronizing literals can consume extra resources (e.g.
   memory) on IMAP servers and can be used for Denial-of-Service
   attacks.  Section 4 motivates creation of the "LITERAL-" extension
   that partially improves the situation.

   This document doesn't raise any other security concerns not already
   raised by [RFC3501].

10.  IANA Considerations

   IMAP4 capabilities are registered by publishing a standards track or
   IESG approved experimental RFC.  The registry is currently located
   at:

      http://www.iana.org/assignments/imap-capabilities

   This document requests that IANA updates the above registry to
   include the entry for LITERAL+ capability pointing to this document.

   This document also requests that IANA adds "LITERAL-" capability
   pointing to this document to the above registry.

   Valuable comments, both in agreement and in dissent, were received
   from Dave Cridland, Michael M Slusarz, Arnt Gulbrandsen, Jayantheesh
   S B., Jamie Nicolson and SM.
