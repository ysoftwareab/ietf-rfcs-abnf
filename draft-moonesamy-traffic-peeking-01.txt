INTERNET DRAFT              Traffic peeking             December 5, 2013


1. Acknowledgements

2. Background

   In June 2013, a news article [Guar1] revealed that the National
   Security Agency obtained direct access to the systems of several
   service providers from the United States through an undisclosed
   surveillance programme called PRISM [Guar2].  The surveillance
   programme intercepted traffic flowing through communication links
   used throughout the world.  According to a news article published in
   October 2013, the National Security Agency had also been wiretapping
   traffic flowing between the datacenters used by Google and Yahoo
   [Wash1].

   In 2007, Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson discussed about the
   possibility of a backdoor in a Dual Elliptic Curve  pseudorandom
   number generator [Rump] (see Appendix D for more information). In
   September, 2013, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
   reported that concern has been expressed about the Dual Elliptic
   Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generation (Dual_EC_DRBG) algorithm
   published in one of its standards (SP 800-90/90A) [NIST]. 

3. Traffic peeking

   RFC 1958 [RFC1958] states that "it is highly desirable that Internet
   carriers protect the privacy and authenticity of all traffic, but
   this is not a requirement of the architecture.  "Tussle in
   Cyberspace: Defining Tomorrow's Internet" [Tussle] states that
   "peeking is irresistible".  Given that most Internet traffic is not
   encrypted, there isn't any significant barrier to hamper an entity
   with the available resources to peek on the traffic of Internet
   carriers.  As data storage is affordable the next step would be to go
   beyond traffic peeking and collect all the data.  [Tussle] argued
   that "if there is information visible in the packet, there is no way
   to keep an intermediate node from looking at it.  So the ultimate
   defense of the end to end mode is end to end encryption".

3.1. Encrypting traffic

   Encrypting traffic "might just be the first step in an escalating
   tussle between the end user and the network provider, in which the
   response of the provider is to refuse to carry encrypted data"
   [Tussle].  It helps to shape the end user's expectations as the
   latter will be aware of the restrictions.

   The end user relies on the organizations recommending the standards

   as it is not possible for the average person to evaluate whether the
   encryption mechanism used will protect the traffic from wiretapping. 
   It is to be noted that some encryption standards are incorporated by
   reference in standards used for the Internet.

4. Security Considerations

   Entities exchanging traffic over the Internet should assume that any
   traffic which is not encrypted should be assumed to be compromised
   given that peeking is irresistible. There is a risk that encrypted
   traffic will not provide any protection if it is stored indefinitely
   as the ability to recover the traffic is preserved.

5. Conclusion

   The security dilemma exists when "many of the means by which a
   country tries to increase its security decrease the security of
   others".  It is up to designers and implementers of a protocol to see
   whether the encryption standard they use will provide a level of the
   security which they consider acceptable.

   It is in the interest of a network provider or a provider of a
   service to collaborate with the relevant government.  The end user
   will usually be at the losing end of the bargain in a tussle between
   the end user and government when Internet traffic wiretapping is a
   matter of national security.

Appendix A: IETF Protocols without encryption

   There are several widely deployed IETF protocols which generate plain
   text (unencrypted) traffic.  The specifications of these protocols
   usually have a Security Considerations section to discuss the
   security issues.  The specifications mentioned below is not an
   exhaustive list of IETF protocols which are vulnerable to traffic
   peeking.

   The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) [RFC0959] is sometimes used for
   transferring files.  The specification does not provide any guidance
   about encrypting the traffic generated by the protocol.

   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] is widely used to
   access the web.   The protocol is sometimes used to provide web
   access to email.  Section 15 of RFC 2616 [RFC2616] does not provide
   any guidance about encrypting the traffic generated by the protocol.

   The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 [RFC3501] can be
   used by the end user to read email messages.  Section 11 of RFC 3501
   [RFC3501] states that "sent in the clear over the network unless
   protection from snooping is negotiated".  There is some information
   about encrypting the traffic generated by the protocol.

   The Post Office Protocol, Version 3 [RFC1939] can be used by the end
   user to read email messages.  Section 13 of RFC 1939[RFC1939] does
   not provide any guidance about encrypting the traffic generated by
   the protocol.

   The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [RFC5321] is used for sending email
   messages.  Section 7 of RFC 5321[RFC5321] states that "SMTP mail is
   inherently insecure".  It is mentioned in the section that "real mail
   security lies only in end-to-end methods".

Appendix B: Wiretapping

   The IETF decided not to consider requirements for wiretapping as part

   of the process for creating and maintaining IETF standards [RFC2804].
    It was the belief of the IETF that "in the case of traffic that is
   today going across the Internet without being protected by the end
   systems (by encryption or other means), the use of existing network
   features, if deployed intelligently, provides extensive opportunities
   for wiretapping".  It was noted that "the end systems take adequate
   measures to protect their communications".

   A well-known wiretapping case is the Athens affair [Athens] which
   targeted the conversations of specific, highly placed government and
   military officials.  The scope of the activity is to a large extent
   unknown.

Appendix C: Lawful Interception

   It was the belief of the IETF that "mechanisms designed to facilitate
   or enable wiretapping, or methods of using other facilities for such
   purposes, should be openly described".  RFC 3924 [RFC3924] describes
   the Cisco Architecture for Lawful Intercept in IP Networks.

   The European Telecommunications Standards Institute, Technical
   Committee Lawful Interception (TC LI) [ETSI1], publishes standards
   about lawful interception. The standards specify the network or
   service protocols necessary to provide handover of lawfully
   intercepted data and traffic, as well as the physical or logical
   point at which the interception has to take place (the handover
   interface) both for packet data and circuit-switched communications.

   In Europe, the Council Resolution of 17 January 1995 on the lawful
   interception of telecommunications (96/C 329/01) enables its member
   states "to conduct the lawful interception of telecommunications",
   subject to national law and interpreted in accordance with applicable
   national policies.  Most countries have a legal framework which
   "generally obliges all providers of public electronic communications
   networks and services to cooperate".  This includes the obligation to
   install interception equipment, usually without compensation.

   In the United States, the Communications Assistance for Law
   Enforcement Act requires telecommunications carriers (including
   broadband Internet access providers and providers of VoIP services)
   "to ensure that equipment, facilities, or services that allow a
   customer or subscriber to "originate, terminate, or direct
   communications," enable law enforcement officials to conduct
   electronic surveillance pursuant to court order or other lawful
   authorization".  The legislation provides for the payment of costs of
   telecommunications carriers to comply with capability requirements
   [USGov1].

   Article 3 of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime about illegal
   interception requires the countries ratifying the treaty "to adopt
   such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish
   as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed
   intentionally".

   The New Zealand Parliament updated its legislation about Interception
   Capability and Security this year.  Several entities provided
   comments about the legislation where it was proposed
   [FBNZ][HUNZ][MSNZ].  It is to be noted that the entities operate in
   several jurisdictions.

Appendix D: Implementation of the Dual Elliptic Curve DRBG

   The Dual EC DRBG was implemented in OpenSSL, an open source general
   purpose cryptography library, in 2011 at the request of a paying
   customer.  The implementer was "well aware at the time of the dubious
   reputation of the algorithm".  It was mentioned that cryptography in
   the United States Federal government is heavily constrained by
   standards [NIST] and vendors selling products to that government
   don't have much of a choice.
