Internet-Draft      PPP over L2TP Tunnel Switching           March 2005 
    

Abstract 

   PPP over L2TP Tunnel Switching, also called L2TP Multihop, is the 
   process of forwarding PPP payload from an L2TP session to another 
   L2TP session over a different tunnel. It facilitates moving the 
   logical termination point of an L2TP session, based on layer 2 
   characteristics or administrative policies, to different LNS. This 
   document introduces the L2TP tunnel switching nomenclature and 
   defines the behavior of standard AVPs in tunnel switching deployment. 
   The scope of this document is limited to the discussion of switching 
   PPP frames over L2TPv2 or L2TPv3 tunnels.

Terminology 

   Tunnel Switching Aggregator (TSA): These are the devices that switch 
   the layer 2 payload on an incoming L2TP session/tunnel on to another 
   L2TP session/tunnel. TSA functions as an LNS for the inbound tunnel 
   and as a LAC for the outbound tunnel. 

   Inbound Tunnel: L2TP Tunnel on TSA where TSA is acting as LNS. 

   Outbound Tunnel: L2TP Tunnel on TSA where TSA is acting as LAC. 

   L2TP, as defined in [1], is now referred to as "L2TPv2," while the 
   extended version defined in [2] is referred to as "L2TPv3". The 
   remainder of this document will refer simply to L2TP in general,

   differ in function. 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

1. Introduction 

   L2TP allows processing of PPP packets to be divorced from the 
   termination of the layer 2 circuit. L2TP tunnel switching facilitates 
   moving the termination point of a PPP session further on to another 
   LNS that is possibly unknown to the first LAC. It does so by re-
   tunneling the PPP session within another L2TP tunnel to a different 
   LNS. The knowledge of whether to switch a PPP session to another L2TP 
   tunnel can be static or dynamic (for example, during PPP session 
   establishment).

                     Figure 1:   L2TP tunnel Switching 

   The figure above presents a typical tunnel switching scenario for 
   incoming calls. The user opens a PPP session to a LAC, which tunnels 
   the session to TSA as defined by L2TP protocol. The TSA, based on the 
   local policies, determines if the incoming session should be further 
   tunneled. If the TSA decides to tunnel the session further, then, for 
   every such session it initiates another session onto another L2TP 
   tunnel originating on the TSA terminating on a different LNS. Once 
   the session is established, the data packets are switched from an 
   incoming tunnel to a corresponding outgoing tunnel. 

2. L2TPv2 to L2TPv3 switch 

   If inbound and outbound tunnels use different versions of L2TP 
   protocol at TSA i.e. if it involves a 'version switch', then it must 
   adapt the data encapsulation change.

          Figure 2:   L2TPv2 to L2TPv3 data encapsulation switch 

   When PPP frames, which are encapsulated in the L2TPv2 header, are 
   received at the TSA and are switched to outbound tunnel using L2TPv3, 
   then L2TPv2 headers are stripped and PPP frame is encapsulated with 
   the PPP sublayer followed by the L2TPv3 data header and forwarded 
   over the session. 

   The version switch may involve a transport change i.e. L2TPv3-IP to 
   L2TPv2-UDP. TSA MUST be able to adapt to such change. 

3. AVP Behavior 

   An incoming AVP MUST be either handled in four ways - it could be 
   relayed, dropped, regenerated, or stacked. They are defined as 
   follows. 

   - RELAYED AVP: (also known as pass-through AVP) AVP is forwarded 
   transparently if it was present in the incoming message. 

   - DROPPED AVP: AVP is dropped if it was present in the incoming 
   message. All the L2TPv3 only AVPs are dropped when switched onto 
   L2TPv2 tunnel. 

   - REGENERATED AVP: AVP in the inbound message is ignored upon 
   receipt. A new AVP is regenerated for the outbound message based on 
   the local policy at the TSA. The local policy may or may not use the

   received AVP to regenerate the new value. The regenerated value may 
   or may not match with the received AVP value. 

   - STACKABLE AVP: Multiple instances of this AVP exist in the incoming 
   message, each representing a hop in the tunnel switched path in order 
   from first to last. When a TSA receives it, all the instances of AVP 
   are copied as-is to the next hop. A locally generated AVP is appended 
   to the outbound message. If no value is appropriate then an AVP with 
   a null value, as determined by the AVP definition, MUST be appended. 
   However, If TSA couldn't copy all of incoming AVPs then it MUST not 
   copy any one of them and drop all of the instances. If this is an AVP 
   required to establish the tunnel or session and TSA cannot copy all 
   of the stacked AVPS, then TSA MUST terminate the connection. 

3.1. IETF Vendor AVPs 

   This section defines the behavior of AVPs according to the guidelines 
   in section 3. It describes the behavior of AVPs defined in [1], [2], 
   [3], [4], and [5]. All the future AVP extensions MUST define AVP 
   behavior for tunnel switching. 

   An optional AVP whose behavior is defined as RELAYED, MUST be RELAYED 
   only if the AVP exists in the inbound message. Hence the behavior for 
   such AVP is stated as 'RELAYED if present in the inbound message'. 

   An optional AVP whose behavior is defined as REGENERATED, could be 
   DROPPED from the outbound message at the TSA's discretion. Hence the 
   behavior for such AVP is stated as 'REGENERATED or DROPPED' 

   Message Type (All Messages) - MUST be REGENERATED 

   Random Vector (All Messages) - MUST be either REGENERATED or DROPPED. 

   Result Code (CDN, StopCCN) - MUST be either RELAYED or REGENERATED 
   based on recommendations discussed in section 5. In case of version 
   switch, if L2TPv3 Result Codes and Error Codes are RELAYED then they 
   MUST be translated into general error (Result Code 2, Error Code 0). 

   Protocol Version (SCCRQ, SCCRP) - MUST be REGENERATED. This would 
   allow TSA to switch sessions when inbound and outbound tunnels use 
   different versions of the L2TP protocol. 

   Framing Capabilities (SCCRQ, SCCRP) - MUST be REGENERATED. 

   Bearer Capabilities (SCCRQ, SCCRP) - MUST be either REGENERATED or 
   DROPPED.

   Assigned Session ID (CDN, ICRP, ICRQ, OCRP, OCRQ) - MUST be 
   REGENERATED. 

   Call Serial Number (ICRQ, OCRQ) - MUST be RELAYED. It would best 
   serve the intended purpose of this AVP and facilitate easier 
   debugging.

   TSA Id AVPs (defined in this document) - MUST be STACKED. The local 
   TSA Id AVP is stacked to the incoming set of TSA Id AVPs. 

4. Loop Detection 

   The TSA ID AVP, Attribute Type TBD, could be used to detect if a 
   session is looping in an L2TP tunnel switched network. This AVP MUST 
   be STACKED.  

   If this AVP was received in an incoming control packet (ICRQ, OCRQ) 
   then the TSA MUST check to see if its own TSA Id (a configured value) 
   is present in the stack of incoming TSA ID AVPs. Upon finding a 
   match, the TSA MUST respond with a CDN carrying a Result Code 
   indicating 'Loop Detected' TBD, and optionally a description 
   indicating the loop condition. 

   The Attribute Value field for this AVP has the following format: 

    0                   1                   2                   3

   uniqueness among all the inter-connected LACs, LNSs and TSAs. If no 
   value is configured then the AVP value MUST be of length 0. 

   This AVP MUST be either hidden (the H-bit can be either 0 or 1). The 
   M-bit for this AVP MUST be set to 0. 

5. CDN Messages and L2TP tunnel Switching 

   To identify the error conditions explicitly in tunnel switching 
   setup, new set error codes are defined. Existing error codes are not 
   used because they might trigger an unwarranted behavior depending 
   upon why it was generated. Error codes are defined as follows: 

   Upstream unreachable (Result Code 2, Error Code TBD) - TSA MUST 
   generate a CDN message with this Error Code for the LAC, if upstream 
   LNS is unreachable and no other alternative paths are available as 
   determined by the local policy. 

   Upstream busy (Result Code 2, Error Code TBD) - TSA MUST generate a 
   CDN message with this Error Code for the LAC, if upstream LNS 
   disconnects the outgoing call with an error code 'TSA Busy' or other 
   indications from upstream indicates the upstream is too busy to take 
   more sessions and no other alternative paths are available as 
   determined by the local policy 

   TSA busy (Result Code 2, Error Code TBD) - TSA MUST generate a CDN 
   message with this Error Code for the LAC, if it is congested or 
   temporarily running out of resources. 

   The TSA MUST generate a CDN with an error code for the LAC, 
   indicating the failure to establish the call. In the case of multiple 
   levels of TSAs, this error code needs to be propagated back until it 
   reaches either the original LAC or an intermediate TSA, which has an 
   alternate path. On the receipt of these error codes, local policy on 
   the LAC or the intermediate TSA should handle the fallback and use it 
   for the congestion recovery design.  

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document requires following parameters to be assigned through 
   IETF Consensus [RFC 2434] as indicated in Section 5 of [1]. These 
   are:  

   AVP - Loop Detection AVP (Section 4) 

   Result Code - Loop Detection (Section 4)

Internet-Draft      PPP over L2TP Tunnel Switching           March 2005 
    

   Error Codes - Upstream unreachable, Upstream busy and TSA busy 
   (Section 5). 

7. Security Considerations 

   TSA Id AVP could reveal the set of nodes that a given L2TP session is 
   traversing in the network. 

   AVP hiding, described in [1] MUST be either used to help mitigate 
   this, though it is not widely regarded as cryptographically secure. 
   [RFC 3193] describes a more robust method for securing L2TP in 
   general, and should be used to encrypt all L2TP messages if access to 
   the information sent within the AVPs described in this document is of 
   concern.
