                 Increasing Maximum Window Size of TCP
                    draft-nishida-tcpm-maxwin-01.txt

Abstract

   This document proposes to increase the current max window size
   allowed in TCP.  It describes the current logic that limits the max
   window size and provides a rationale to relax the limitation as well
   as the negotiation mechanism to enable this feature safely.

1.  Introduction

   TCP throughput is determined by two factors: Round Trip Time and
   Receive Window size.  It can never exceed Receive Window size divided
   by RTT.  This implies larger window size is important to achive
   better performance.  Original TCP's maximum window size defined in
   RFC793 [RFC0793] is 2^16 -1 (65,535), however, RFC7323 [RFC7323]
   defines TCP Window Scale option which allows TCP to use larger window
   size.  Window Scale uses a shift count stored in 1-byte field in the
   option.  The receiver of the option uses left-shifted window size
   value by the shift count as actual window size.  When Window Scale is
   used, TCP can extend maximum window size to 2^30 - 2^14
   (1,073,725,440).  This is because the maximum shift count is 14 as
   described in the Section 2.3 of RFC7323 [RFC7323].  However, since
   TCP's sequence number space is 2^32, we believe it is still possible
   to use larger window size than this while careful design of the logic
   that can identify segments inside the window is required.  In this
   document, we propose to increase the maximum shift count to 15, which
   extend window size to 2^31 - 2^15.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Increasing Maximum Window Size

   RFC7232 requires maximum window size to be less than 2^30 as
   described below.

     "
     TCP determines if a data segment is "old" or "new" by testing whether
     its sequence number is within 2^31 bytes of the left edge of the
     window, and if it is not, discarding the data as "old".  To insure
     that new data is never mistakenly considered old and vice versa, the
     left edge of the sender's window has to be at most 2^31 away from the
     right edge of the receiver's window.  The same is true of the
     sender's right edge and receiver's left edge.  Since the right and
     left edges of either the sender's or receiver's window differ by the
     window size, and since the sender and receiver windows can be out of
     phase by at most the window size, the above constraints imply that
     two times the maximum window size must be less than 2^31, or

                               max window < 2^30
     "

   However, TCP does not necessarily need to determine if a segment is
   old or new.  Because important point is to determine if a receive
   segment is inside of the window or not.  It basically does not matter
   if a segment is too old (left side of the window) or too new (right
   side of the window) as long as it is outside of the window.  Based on
   this viewpoint, we propose to extend maximum window to 2^31 - 2^15,
   which can be attained by increasing maximum shift count to 15.

   To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal, we would like to use
   the following worst case example where the sender and the receiver
   windows are completely out of phase.  In this example, we define S as
   the sender's left ledge of the window and W as the sender's window
   size.  Hence, the sender's right ledge of the window is S+W.  Also,
   the receiver's left ledge of the window is S+W+1 and the right ledge
   of the window is S+2W+1, as they are out of phase.  This situation
   can happen when the sender sent all segments in the window and the
   receiver received all segments while no ACK has been received by the
   sender yet.  Now, we presume a segment that contains sequence number
   S has arrived at the receiver.  This segment should be excluded by
   the receiver, although it can easily happen when the sender
   retransmits segments.

   In case of W=2^31, the receiver cannot exclude this segment as S+2W =
   S.  It is considered inside of the window.  (S+W+1 < S < S+2W+1)
   However, our proposed window size is W=2^31-X, where X is 2^15.  In
   this case, when segment S has arrived, the following checks will be
   performed.  First, TCP checks it with the left edge of the window and
   it considers the segment is left side of the left edge.  (S < S+W+1
   Note: W=2^31-X) Second, TCP checks it with the right edge of the
   window and it considers the segment is right of the right edge.  (S >
   S+2W+1) You might notice that the result of the second check is not
   expected one as the segment S is actually an old segment.  This is

   the problem that the referred paragraphs from RFC7232 [RFC7323]
   describe.  However, the segment is properly excluded by the receiver
   as both checks indicate it is outside of the window.  It should be
   noted that the principle of TCP requires to accept the segment S only
   when it has passed both checks successfully, which means S must
   satisfy the following condition.

                    S >= left edge && S <= right edge

   As we have shown in the example, our proposed maximum window size:
   W=2^31-2^15 does not affect this principle.

4.  Signaling Method

   In this proposal, the following two types of signaling methods are
   available.

4.1.  Non-synchronized Signalling

   Non-synchronized signaling method does not require to verify that
   both endnodes supports new maximum window size.  In this method, an
   end node that supports new maximum window size simply sets 15 to the
   shift count in Window Scale option.  A potential problem of this
   approach is that an endnode cannot verify if the peer supports shift
   count 15 when the peer does not use shift count 15 in its Window
   Scale option.  However, we believe this is not a significant problem.
   An endnode that does not support shift count 15 will simply use 14 as
   specified in [RFC7323].  This will not cause a fatal issue while the
   window size used by the sender will be smaller than the actual
   available window size at the receiver.  One way to mitigate this
   issue is to advertise new maximum window size (or closer value) as
   much as possible.  When an RFC7323 endnode sees new maximum window
   size value, it is automatically parsed as the current maximum window
   size.

4.2.  Synchronized Signaling

   Synchronized signaling that can verify both endnodes support new
   maximum window size can be achived by introducing a new TCP option.
   In this method, when a sender sends Window Scale option with shift
   count 15 in the SYN segment, it also includes new TCP option to
   indicate it supports new maximum value.  The receiver of the segment
   MUST include this new option in the SYN/ACK segment if it supports
   new maximum value.  When the sender receives this option, it can use
   shift count 15, otherwise it should use shift count 14.  This method
   guarantees that both endpoints can correctly parse the new shift
   count.

5.  Use Cases, Benefits to Explore Maximum Window Size

   One of the use cases of the extended maximum window size is high
   volume data transfer over paths with long RTT delays and high
   bandwidth, called long fat pipes.  The proposed extension improves
   and doubles at most the maximum throughput when bandwidth-latency
   product is greater than 1 GB.  As propagation delay in an optical
   fiber is around 20 cm/ns, RTT will be over 100 milliseconds when the
   distance of the transmission is more than 10000km.  This distance is
   not extraordinary for trans-pacific communications.  In this case,
   the maximum throughput will be limited to 80Gbps with the current
   maximum window size, although network technologies for more than 100
   GBps are becoming common these days.

   As the current TCP sequence number space is limited to 32 bits, it
   will not be possible to increase maximum window size any further.
   However, TCP may eventually have other extensions to increase
   sequence number space, for example, [RFC7323] and [RFC1263] mention
   about increasing sequence number space to 64 bits.  We believe the
   information in this document will be useful when such extensions are
   proposed as they need to define new maximum window size.

7.  Security Considerations

   It is known that an attacker can have more chances to insert forged
   packets into a TCP connection when large window size is used.  This
   is not a specific problem of this proposal, but a generic problem to
   use larger window.  Using PAWS can mitigate this problem, however, it
   is recommended to consult the Security Considerations section of
   RFC7323 [RFC7323] to check its implications.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document may request new TCP option codepoint.
