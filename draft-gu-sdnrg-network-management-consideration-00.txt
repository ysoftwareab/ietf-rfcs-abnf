1.  Introduction

   In cloud datacenter deployment,virtualized infrastructure of virtual
   machines and physcial infrastructure of bare-metal servers are both
   deployed.  Openstack K version, SDN controller, open virtual switch,
   SDN ToR (top of rack) switch and SDN gateway are chosen.Openstack
   manages computing, storage and the network by neutron, nova, ironic
   module and so on.SDN controller receives the messages of network
   operation and translates it into forwarding devices.Open virtual
   switch, SDN ToR switch and SDN gateway are forwarding devices.

   After the deployment, we have faced the problems in management of SDN
   network with all these added devices.The management are devided into
   three parts: network monitoring, network detection, and alarm and log
   aiming at devices, services and tenants.Difficulties lie in that:

   (1) There are two network layers including overlay and underlay
   increasing the difficulty of troubleshooting.

   (2) Devices such as open virtual swith, openstack and others are
   software based.High reliability can be a problem.

   (3) Logical network can be operated by tenants which increases risks.

   (4) Openstack, controller, open virtual switch and SDN tor are new
   devices added in the network which should be covered by manager as
   long as large numbers of virtual machines.

   (5) Operations can be at anytime and anywhere with the requirement of
   real time management.

   This draft presents several considerations in management of SDN
   datacenters.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Definition of terms

   EP: end point

   NFV: network function virtualization

   SDN: software defined network

   SFC: service function chaining

   ToR: top of rack

   VM: virtual machine

   VPC: virtual private cloud

   VSW: virtual switch

4.  SDN management usecases

4.1.  Network monitoring

   Network monitoring includes network devices, configurations, physical
   topology and logical topology.Network monitoring should be based on
   underlay and overlay network.Virtualized network elements correspond
   to physical network devices.Virtual networks of vm correspond to vsw
   with its interface as well as the ToR.Real-time monitoring is
   required.Status of devices and topologies should be updated
   automately.Performance of devices are monitored.

   Tenants can get the information of their own logical network
   including configuration, topology, and performance in order to own
   network self-management.

   Manager of network can get the information of network resources and
   system resources.The network resources includes virtual network
   resource such as subnetwork and traffic path and physical network
   resources such as vxlan gateway, vsw, ToR and so on.  System resource
   includes controller, IT resources, devices of firewall and load
   balancer.

4.2.  Network detection

   Network detection aims at trouble-shooting automatically and fault
   prediction.In underlay network, traditional detection technology can
   be adopted as usual.In SDN network, the overlay network should be
   added in detection.Besides the device diagnosis and network diagnosis
   should be taken action.With the collected data of packet-loss and
   time delay as well as the logical and physical topology,we can
   undergo the trouble-shooting and prediction.

   For example, the vtep detection detects the time delay and packet-
   loss through each two vtep in SDN network.The point where packet loss
   comes out is detected again with two vteps.Thus the fault point can
   be located.

   The service detection varifies service such as VPC or service
   function chain.Controller simulates the traffic about the virtual
   private cloud of one tenants with virtual routers and virtual
   bridges.With the collected information of traffic, tenants service
   are detected.

4.3.  Alarm and log

   It's easy of design alarm and log in devices monitoring.  While in
   overlay networks related with tenants, alarm and log needs to be
   taken overall consideration.

   The contents of alarm and log are TBD.

5.  Conclusion

   SDN and NFV technology has been planned to be co-deployed in the
   cloud datacenters in providing services such as VPC and VAS of
   layer4-layer7.Through the resolution test, we have found out that key
   problems on network architecture, virtualized platform, standard
   interfaces, high availability, practice guidance and many others
   exist.More tests, trails and standardization work need to be
   conducted in preparing the large-scale commercial deployment of SDN
   and NFV technology in cloud datacenters.
