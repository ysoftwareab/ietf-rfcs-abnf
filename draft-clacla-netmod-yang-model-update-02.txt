1.  Introduction

   The YANG data modeling language [RFC7950] specifies strict rules for
   updating YANG modules (see section 11 "Updating a Module").  Citing a
   few of the relevant rules for this document:

   1.  "As experience is gained with a module, it may be desirable to
       revise that module.  However, changes to published modules are
       not allowed if they have any potential to cause interoperability
       problems between a client using an original specification and a
       server using an updated specification."

   2.  "Note that definitions contained in a module are available to be
       imported by any other module and are referenced in "import"
       statements via the module name.  Thus, a module name MUST NOT be
       changed.  Furthermore, the "namespace" statement MUST NOT be
       changed, since all XML elements are qualified by the namespace."

   3.  "Otherwise, if the semantics of any previous definition are
       changed (i.e., if a non-editorial change is made to any
       definition other than those specifically allowed above), then
       this MUST be achieved by a new definition with a new identifier."

   What are the consequences?

   1.  Ideally, the YANG module names should not be changed due the
       importance of not changing the automation code in case of import
       statements or service composition at the orchestration layer.

   2.  When the same YANG module name is kept, the new YANG module
       revision must always be updated in a backward-compatible way.

2.  The Problems

   This section lists a series of problems, hopefully listed in a
   logical order, which leads to the solution in the next section.

2.1.  Slow Standardization

   The conclusions drawn in the introduction lead to the logical
   conclusion that the standardized YANG modules have to be perfect on
   day one (at least the structure), which in turn might explain why all
   the IETF YANG modules take so long to standardize.  Shooting for
   perfection (at least in structure) is obviously a noble goal, but if
   the perfect standard comes too late, it doesn't help the industry.

2.2.  Some YANG Modules are Not Backward Compatible

   As we learn from our mistakes, we're going to face more and more
   backward-incompatible YANG modules.  An example is the YANG data
   model for L3VPN service delivery [RFC8049], which, based on
   implementation experience, must be updated in a backward-incompatible
   way with draft-wu-l3sm-rfc8049bis [I-D.wu-l3sm-rfc8049bis].

   While Standards Development Organization (SDO) YANG modules are
   obviously better for the industry, we must recognize that many YANG
   modules are actually generated YANG modules (for example, from
   internal databases), also known as native YANG modules, or vendor
   modules [RFC8199].  From time to time, the new YANG modules are not
   backward-compatible.

   In such cases, it would be better to indicate how backward-compatible
   a given YANG module actually is.

2.3.  A Zoo of YANG Modules

   Even if we focus on the IETF, we have to observe that many SDOs,
   opensource fora, and vendors develop YANG modules develop YANG
   modules.  This should be considered a success for an IETF developed
   technoogy.  However, the operators are faced with this problem: how
   to select the YANG modules to take into account for their service
   developments.

Internet-Draft                YANG Catalog                 November 2017


   The site <https://www.yangcatalog.org> (and the YANG catalog that it
   provides: YANG module for yangcatalog.org,
   [I-D.clacla-netmod-model-catalog]) is an attempt to become a
   reference for all YANG modules available in the industry, for both
   YANG developers to search on what exists already) and for operators
   (to discover the more mature YANG models to automate services).  This
   YANG catalog should not only contain pointers to the YANG modules
   themselves, but also contain metadata related to those YANG modules:
   What is the module type (service model or not?); what is the maturity
   level? (e.g., for the IETF: is this an RFC, a working group document
   or an individual draft?); is this module implemented?; who is the
   contact?; is there open-source code available?  And we expect many
   more in the future.  The industry has begun to understand that the
   metadata related to YANG models become equally important as the YANG
   models themselves.

   The yangcatalog.org instantiation of the catalog provides a means for
   module authors and vendors implementing modules to upload their
   metadata, which is then searchable via an API, as well as using a
   variety of web-based tools.  The instructions for contributing and
   searching for metadata can be found at <https://www.yangcatalog.org/
   contribute.php>.

   The issue is actually the number of YANG modules the operators are
   offered.  At the time of writing this document, the number of unique
   YANG modules in the catalog is exactly 2596 (and that number keeps
   growing), while the IETF has standardized or is busy standardizing a
   small subset of those.  Therefore, it's important to distinguish the
   relevant YANG modules with the pack and to understand the
   relationship between the YANG modules.

2.4.  YANG Modules Obsolete Relationship

   So the operators use the yangcatalog.org to discover which YANG
   modules they can use NOW.  They base their selection not only on the
   YANG module content, but also on the related metadata.  When faced
   with the zoo of the YANG modules, it's difficult to understand the
   relationship between YANG modules.  As an example: how could an
   operator discovers that a YANG-MODULE-B obsoletes YANG-MODULE-A?
   Indeed, both have different YANG module names.  The only available
   information is an "obsolete" tag in the published RFC containing
   YANG-MODULE-B: this tag would point to YANG-MODULE-A.  In the world
   of automation, going through a published RFC as a level of
   indirection to understand the YANG module obsolete relationship is a
   non starter.  Food for thought: the IETF should stop thinking that
   the metric for success is an RFC number, as opposed to the contained
   YANG module(s).

Internet-Draft                YANG Catalog                 November 2017


   We need an automatic way to discover that a YANG-MODULE-B obsoletes
   YANG-MODULE-A, so that YANG-MODULE-A should not be given any
   attention.

   The following example is not an automatic way.

       description
           "This YANG module defines a generic service configuration
           model for Layer 3 VPNs. This model is common across all
           vendor implementations. This obsoletes the RFC8049 YANG
           module, ietf-l3vpn-svc@2017-01-2";
       revision 2017-09-14 {
           description
           "First revision of RFC8049.";
           reference
           "RFC xxxx: YANG Data Model for L3VPN Service Delivery";

   Along the same lines, going through an out-of-band tool such as the
   yangcatalog.org in order to discover the obsolete relationship is a
   possible automatic way, but not ideal.

2.5.  YANG Module Transition Strategy

   Let's assume for a moment that we change the YANG module, with the
   specific example of the ietf-routing, which some propose to update to
   ietf-routing-2.

   Here are all the ietf-routing dependent YANG modules (those modules
   that depend on ietf-routing) <https://www.yangcatalog.org/yang-
   search/impact_analysis.php?modules[]=ietf-
   routing&recurse=0&rfcs=1&show_subm=1&show_dir=dependents>.  So many
   YANG modules.

   Let's look at the difference for ietf-routing-2:
   <https://www.yangcatalog.org/yang-search/
   impact_analysis.php?modules[]=ietf-routing-
   2&recurse=0&rfcs=1&show_subm=1&show_dir=dependents>.

   Changing the module name from ietf-routing to ietf-routing-2 implies
   that the we have to warn all draft authors of ietf-routing YANG
   dependent modules.  Firstly, to make sure they are aware of ietf-
   routing-2 (publishing a RFC8022bis mentioning in the module
   description that this module is not compatible with the NMDA
   architecture, and providing a pointer to ietf-routing-2 ... is not an
   automatic way... so barely useful).  And secondly, to ask them to
   change their import (or service composition) to ietf-routing-2.
   Hopefully, in the ietf-routing case, all dependent YANG modules are
   part of the IETF, so the communication is a manageable.

   Changing the ietf-interfaces YANG module name would be a different
   challenge, as it's used throughout the industry:

   impact_analysis.php?modules[]=ietf-
   interfaces&recurse=0&rfcs=1&show_subm=1&show_dir=dependents>

3.  The Solution

   The solution is composed of two mandator aspects, a semantic
   versioning YANG extension and an update to RFC7950.  An optional
   additional check, validating the semantic versioning from a syntact
   point of view, can either assist in determining the correct semantic
   versioning values, or can help in determining the values for YANG
   modules that don't support this extension.

3.1.  SEMVER Semantic Versioning

   The semantic versioning solution proposed here as already been
   proposed in [I-D.openconfig-netmod-model-catalog] (cut/paste here
   with the authors permission)which itself is based on
   [openconfigsemver].  The goal is to indicate the YANG module
   backwards (in)compatibility, following semver.org semantic versioning
   [semver]:

      MAJOR is incremented when the new version of the specification is
      incompatible with previous versions.

      MINOR is incremented when new functionality is added in a manner
      that is backward-compatible with previous versions.

      PATCH is incremented when bug fixes are made in a backward-
      compatible manner.

    // extension statements
     extension openconfig-version {
       argument "semver" {
         yin-element false;
       }
       description
         "The OpenConfig version number for the module. This is
         expressed as a semantic version number of the form:
           x.y.z
         where:
           * x corresponds to the major version,
           * y corresponds to a minor version,
           * z corresponds to a patch version.
         This version corresponds to the model file within which it is
         defined, and does not cover the whole set of OpenConfig models.
         Where several modules are used to build up a single block of
         functionality, the same module version is specified across each
         file that makes up the module.

         A major version number of 0 indicates that this model is still
         in development (whether within OpenConfig or with industry
         partners), and is potentially subject to change.

         Following a release of major version 1, all modules will
         increment major revision number where backwards incompatible
         changes to the model are made.

         The minor version is changed when features are added to the
         model that do not impact current clients use of the model.

         The patch-level version is incremented when non-feature changes
         (such as bugfixes or clarifications to human-readable
         descriptions that do not impact model functionality) are made
         that maintain backwards compatibility.

         The version number is stored in the module meta-data.";
     }

   Along these lines, we propose the following YANG 1.1 extension for a
   more generic semantic version.  The formal definition is found at the
   end of this document.

           extension module-version {
               argument "semver" {
                   yin-element false;
               }
           }

   The extension would typically be used this way:

         yang-version "1";
         namespace "name-space";
         prefix "prefix-name";

   See also "Semantic Versioning and Structure for IETF Specifications"
   [I-D.claise-semver] for a mechanism to combine the semantic
   versioning, the github tools, and a potential change to the IETF
   process.

3.2.  Updating the YANG 1.1 Specifications

   RFC 7950 section 11, must be updated to express:

   "As experience is gained with a module, it may be desirable to revise
   that module.  Changes to published modules are allowed, even if they
   have some potential to cause interoperability problems, at the
   condition that the semantic versioning change are clearly indicated
   based on the SEMVER YANG extension."

3.3.  The Derived Semantic Version

   The YANG catalog contains not only the most up-to-date YANG module
   revision of a given module, but keeps all previous revisions as well.
   With APIs in mind, it's important to understand whether different
   YANG module revisions are backward compatible (this is specifically
   imported for native YANG modules, i.e. the ones where generated-from
   = native), even for the YANG modules that don't support the YANG
   extension specified in this document.

   Two distinct leaves in the YANG module
   [I-D.clacla-netmod-model-catalog] contain this semver notation:

      the semantic-version leaf contains the value embedded within a
      YANG module (if it is available).

      the derived-semantic-version leaf is established by examining the
      the YANG module themselves.  As such derived-semantic-version only
      takes syntax into account as opposed to the meaning of various
      elements when it computes the semantic version.

      The algorithm used to produce the derived-semantic-version is as
      follows:

      1.  Order all modules of the same name by revision from oldest to
          newest.

      2.  If module A, revision N+1 has failed compilation, bump its
          derived semantic MAJOR version.

      3.  Else, run "pyang --check-update-from" on module A, revision N
          and revision N+1 to see if backward-incompatible changes
          exist.

Internet-Draft                YANG Catalog                 November 2017


      4.  If backward-incompatible changes exist, bump module A,
          revision N+1's derived MAJOR semantic version.

      5.  If no backward-incompatible changes exist, compare the pyang
          trees of module A, revision N and revision N+1.

      6.  If there are structural differences (e.g., new nodes), bump
          module A, revision N+1's derived MINOR semantic version.

      7.  If no structural differences exist, bump module A, revision
          N+1's derived PATCH semantic version.

   Note that the absolute numbers in the semantic-version and derived-
   semantic-version are actually meaningless by themselves.  That is,
   one must compare two different semver values for a given module to
   understand the compatibility between them.

4.  Open Issues

   More work is needed in order to fully flesh out the semantic version
   requirements for YANG modules.  These include the following.

      A new kind of import is required.  Today, we have import by
      revision (though this is seldomly used).  There should also be an
      import by module-version (i.e., the semantic version).  This
      import will not simply be a copy of import by revision.
      Consideration needs to be given to expressions such as,
      "version==X", "version>=X", "major version==X", "major
      version>=X", etc.

      Similarly to import-by-version, we may also require a new naming
      convention for modules.  Today, modules are named in
      module@revision.yang notation.  Re-using the '@' for version is
      not ideal.  Perhaps a new character such as '%' is needed (i.e.,
      module%version.yang).  In this manner, both version and revision
      could be used.

      Taking another page from Openconfig, the notion of a module bundle
      should be considered.  That is, there may need to be a way to
      enumerate modules that are part of a bundle and are known to
      interoperate.  This may not be as critical if a rich import-by-
      version is defined.

      Similarly, the concept of a feature bundle should be considered.
      Typically, operators combine and test YANG modules to build value-
      add services.  These bundles form releases for specific features
      or services, and it is critical to ensure as the modules evolve,
      the bundles can coherently evolve with them.

   More work is needed in order to fully flesh out the semantic version
   requirements for YANG modules (ultimately, a choice needs to be made
   as to what the next item is on which to focus).

5.  Semantic Version Extension Module

          * z corresponds to a patch version.
         This version corresponds to the model file within which it is
         defined.

         A major version number of 0 indicates that this model is still
         in development, and is potentially subject to change.

         Following a release of major version 1, all modules will
         increment major revision number where backwards incompatible
         changes to the model are made.

         The minor version is changed when features are added to the
         model that do not impact current clients use of the model.

         The patch-level version is incremented when non-feature changes
         (such as bugfixes or clarifications to human-readable
         descriptions that do not impact model functionality) are made
         that maintain backwards compatibility.

         The version number is stored in the module meta-data.

         By comparing the module-version between two revisions of a given
         module, one can know if revision N+1 is backwards compatible or
         not relative to revision N, as well as whether or not new features
         have been added to revision N+1.";
