                      Global connectivity in 6LoWPAN
              draft-kahng-6lowpan-global-connectivity-01.txt


Abstract

   This document specifies the translation mechanism mapping IPv6
   address with 128 bits to the Adaptation Identifier (AID) with 16 bits.
   When a device in IEEE 802.15.4 domain needs to communicate with other
   nodes in IPv6 domain, it should acquire source AID and destination
   AID corresponding to source IPv6 address and destination IPv6 address,
   respectively from an IPv6 translation-capable gateway. The node will
   send packets using these AIDs to the gateway, and then the gateway
   will translate them to normal IPv6 addresses using the mapping table
   already associated.

1. Introduction

   IETF 6LoWPAN Working Group is an IPv6 based low-power wireless area
   network and has been working for IPv6 packets to be sent to and
   received from over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks for applications
   which require wireless internet connectivity at lower data rates for
   devices.

   However it is well known that the management of addresses for devices
   that communicate across the two dissimilar domains of IPv6 and
   IEEE802.15.4 is complicated. IEEE802.15.4 standard packet size is 127
   bytes, among which IEEE 64 bit extended addresses may be used. After
   an association, 16 bits are used as a unique ID in a PAN L2, Still
   only 102 bytes are available for payload at MAC layer. Now
   considering the devices need to communicate with other nodes via IPv6
   domain, 256 bits of the source and destination addresses seem to be
   cumbersome in a limited MAC payload fields.

   It is obvious that the IP connectivity between 6LowPANs and the
   global IPv6 networks is necessary. For this connectivity, [I-
   D.6lowpan-interoperability] proposes the mapping of 16 bits short
   address and the interoperability between 6LowPAN devices and the
   external IPV6 networks. However this document does not specify
   multiple network prefix address but does single network prefix
   address to use 16 bit short addresses. In the case of the network
   configuration for the connectivity between 6LowPANs and the external
   IPv6 networks, multiple network prefix address must be considered for
   several connections between them. So this document describes the AID
   assignment mechanism in the gateway not only to support multiple
   network prefix address but also to map unique IPv6 address to AID
   with short length. The encoding of AID utilizes 2 bytes; 1 byte is
   used for identifying each node in IEEE 802.15.4. The other 1 byte is
   used for identifying the external IPV6 node connected with the node
   of IEEE 802.15.4. How the value of AID is determined in the gateway
   is out of scope.

   As a result, this document defines an encoding format, LOWPAN_GCHC,
   for effective compression of Global IPv6 address based on shared
   state with AID. In addition, this document also introduces additional
   frame format over the header compression format defined in [RFC 4944]

   This document is based on [Interoperability of 6LoWPAN] for the
   adaptation layer of fragmentation and reassembly, the stateless
   address auto-configuration based on EUI-64[EUI64].

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Readers are expected to be familiar with all the terms and concepts
   that are discussed in "IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area
   Networks (6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and
   Goals" [RFC4919], and "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE
   802.15.4 Networks" [RFC4944].

   The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for
   "octet".

3. Global Connectivity in 6LoWPAN

   This section defines the gateway architecture for the Global
   Connectivity between the global IPv6 nodes and 6LowPANs. Figure 1
   shows the example of the IPv6 connection between the gateway and the
   external IPv6 nodes. The gateway performs new AID assignment
   operation to be mapped with IPV6 address by the request of IEEE
   802.16 node and executes translation operation which maps IPv6
   address encoded with 16 bytes to AID with 2 bytes to compress packet
   header and vice versa.

3.1. AID for outbound traffic

   Outbound traffic means the traffic from the inner node to the outer
   nodes.

   1. Each node in 6LowPAN checks if it has an AID identifying its own
      global IPv6 address.

   2. Each node can use the AID if it has. Unless, it should request the
      new AID to the gateway.

   3. Each node in 6LowPAN checks if it has an AID identifying its
      corresponding global IPv6 address.

   4. Each node can use the AID if it has. Unless, it should request to
      new AID to the gateway.

   5. Each node should request to the gateway to delete both AIDs if
      they didn't use during a certain time.



3.2. AID for inbound traffic

   Inbound traffic means the traffic from the outer node to the inner
   nodes.

   1. The Gateway checks if it has an AID identifying Source IPv6
      address of the received inbound traffic.

   2. The Gateway can use the AID if it has. Unless, it should assign
      the new AID for Source IPv6 address in the inbound traffic.

   3. The Gateway checks if it has an AID identifying Destination IPv6
      address of the received inbound traffic.

   4. The Gateway can use the AID if it has. Unless, it should assign
      the new AID for Destination IPv6 address in the inbound traffic.

   5. Each node should request to the gateway to delete both AIDs if
      they didn't use during a certain time.



3.3. AID Assignment in the Gateway

   An AID must be assigned by the Gateway according to the following
   assignment method. The length of an AID being assigned is 2 bytes.

   1. If the Gateway receives the AID request frame for the specific
      IPv6 address, it looks up its own address mapping table for the
      specific IPv6 address.

   2. If the Gateway finds the AID matched with the specific IPv6
      address, it will return the AID. Otherwise, it will generate and
      return the new AID not to be duplicated.



3.4. AID deletion in the Gateway

   An AID must be deleted by the Gateway according to the following
   deletion method.

   1. If the Gateway receives the AID delete frame for the specific AID,
      it looks up its own address mapping table for the AID.

   2. If the Gateway finds the AID, it will delete the AID. Otherwise,
      it neglects the frame.



4. Mapping Table Global Connectivity in 6LoWPAN

   Gateway has the address mapping table as shown in Figure 2. The
   length of Global IPv6 address field is 128 bits. The length of AID is
   16 bits.

                      Figure 2: Address Mapping Table



5. Frame Format for AID Assignment

    The format shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 are the payload in the
    IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol data unit (PDU). The Frame format was
    used in communications to assign AID between internal nodes and
    gateway. Each AID will represent its corresponding global IP address.
    The Frame format is defined in Figure 3.

             +-----------------------------------------------+
            Figure 3: A LoWPAN encapsulated AID Assignment Frame

   The details of AID Message Parameters are defined below in Section 6.

   The encapsulation format defined in Figure 4 defines LOWPAN_GCHC
   encoding format for compressing the IPv6 header. To enable effective
   compression LOWPAN_GCHC relies on AID information pertaining to AID
   Assignment Frame.

5.1. AID REQUEST frame

   In case that the node in 6LowPAN needs a new IPV6 connection with the
   external node in IPV6 network, the node must send AID REQUEST frame
   to the gateway. The source address and destination address must set
   to its source address and the destination address of the external
   node respectively. To get new source AID and destination AID, both
   AID must be set to zero. The format of AID REQUEST frame is in Figure
   6.

   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
                    Figure 6: AID REQUEST frame format



5.2. AID REPLY frame

   As the response of AID REPLY frame, the gateway must reply to the
   node in 6LowPAN by sending AID REPLY frame. In case of AID REPLY
   frame, the frame must be sent to the node in 6LowPAN from the gateway.
   The gateway must assign unique values as the values of source AID and
   destination AID. How to calculate and decide the values of the source
   AID and the destination AID is out of scope except that 1 byte is
   used for identifying each node in IEEE 802.15.4 and the other 1 byte
   is used for identifying the external IPV6 node connected with the
   node of IEEE 802.15.4. AID REPLY frame format is in the Figure 7.

5.3. AID DELETE frame

   The node in 6LowPAN must send AID DELETE frame to the gateway. After
   the node in 6LowPAN disconnected to the Global IPV6 node, it must
   send AID DELETE frame to the gateway to inform not to use the values
   any longer. The format of AID DELETE frame is in the Figure 8.

5.4. LOWPAN_GCHC frame

   After AID assignment, LOWPAN_GCHC frame indicates that the following
   header is encoded using AID values. The LOWPAN_GCHC encoding utilizes
   4 octets, 2 of which is source AID and 2 of which is Destination AID.
   Any information from the uncompressed IPv6 header fields is carried
   in-line following the LOWPAN_GCHC encoding. The format of LOWPAN_GCHC
   is in the Figure 9.
