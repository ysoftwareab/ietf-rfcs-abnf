Internet-Draft                  2-Way RSS                   January 2006


1.  Introduction

   2-Way RSS uses HTTP [RFC2616] and XML [XML 1.0] to publish and edit
   Web resources.


2.  Editor's Note

   To discuss this draft, please join the 2-Way RSS mailing list [1].
   Membership is open to all.


3.  Notational Conventions

   [@@ 2-Way RSS namespace docs]

   The term 'URI' is shorthand for the identifier specified in
   [RFC3986].


4.  The 2-Way RSS Model

   2-Way RSS uses HTTP to operate on collections of Web resources
   represented by RSS feeds [RSS].  This section illustrates the editing
   cycle for RSS items.
   o  GET is used to retrieve an item or perform a read-only query.
   o  POST is used to create a new, dynamically-named item.
   o  PUT is used to update an existing item.
   o  DELETE is used to remove an item.


5.  Discovery

   To discover the location of the feeds exposed by a 2-way RSS service,
   the client must locate and request the Service Outline, an OPML
   document [OPML].


      Client                      Server
      |                                |
      |  1.) GET Service Outline URI   |
      |------------------------------->|
      |                                |
      |  2.) Service OPML Document     |
      |<-------------------------------|
      |                                |

Internet-Draft                  2-Way RSS                   January 2006


   1.  The client sends a GET request to the Service Outline URI.
   2.  The server responds with an OPML Document containing the
       locations of feeds provided by the service.  The content of this
       document can vary based on aspects of the client request,
       including, but not limited to, authentication credentials.


6.  Listing

   Once the client has discovered the location of a feed in the outline,
   it can request a listing of the feed's items.  However, a feed might
   contain an extremely large number of items, so servers are likely to
   list a small subset of them by default.


      Client                      Server
      |                                |
      |  1.) GET to RSS Feed URI       |
      |------------------------------->|
      |                                |
      |  2.) 200 OK, RSS Feed Doc      |
      |<-------------------------------|
      |                                |


   1.  The client sends a GET request to the RSS Feed's URI.
   2.  The server responds with an RSS Feed Document containing a full
       or partial listing of the feed's membership.


7.  Authoring

   After locating a feed, a client can add entries by sending a POST
   request to the feed; other changes are accomplished by sending HTTP
   requests to each item.

7.1.  Create


      Client                      Server
      |                                |
      |  1.) POST Item to Feed URI     |

   1.  The client sends an RSS item to the server via HTTP POST.  The
       Request URI is that of the RSS Feed.
   2.  The server responds with a response of "201 Created" and a
       "Location" header containing the URI of the newly-created RSS
       item.

7.2.  Read


      Client                      Server
      |                                |
      |  1.) GET or HEAD to Item URI   |
      |------------------------------->|
      |                                |
      |  2.) 200 OK RSS Item           |
      |<-------------------------------|
      |                                |


   1.  The client sends a GET (or HEAD) request to the item's URI.
   2.  The server responds with an RSS item.

7.3.  Update


      Client                      Server
      |                                |
      |  1.) PUT to RSS Item URI       |
      |------------------------------->|

      |<-------------------------------|
      |                                |


   1.  The client PUTs an updated RSS item to the item's URI.
   2.  The server responds with a successful status code.

7.4.  Delete


      Client                      Server
      |                                |

      |                                |


   1.  The client sends a DELETE request to the item's URI.
   2.  The server responds with successful status code.

7.5.  Success and Failure

   HTTP defines classes of response.  HTTP status codes of the form 2xx
   signal that a request was successful.  HTTP status codes of the form
   4xx or 5xx signal that an error has occurred, and the request has
   failed.  Consult the HTTP specification for more detailed definitions
   of each status code.


8.  2-Way RSS Feeds

8.1.  GET

   RSS feeds can contain extremely large numbers of items.  A naive
   client such as a web spider or web browser would be overwhelmed if
   the response to a GET contained every item in the feed, and the
   server would waste large amounts of bandwidth and processing time on
   clients unable to handle the response.  As a result, responses to a
   simple GET request represent a server-determined subset of the items
   in the feed.

   An example 2-Way RSS feed:

          <rss>
            <channel>
              <title>The Baron in the Trees</title>
              <link>http://example.org/trees.html</link>
              <description>Recent posts.</description>
              <!-- 0 or more item elements follow -->
              <item>
                <title>Chapter One</title>
                <description>It started out simple...</description>
                <guid>uuid:941e12b4-6eeb-4753-959d-0cbc51875387</guid>
                <link>http://example.org/chapter1.html</link>
                <r:edit href="./item7.rss"/>
              </item>
            </channel>
          </rss>

   Each member item is represented by an <item> element, but those items
   are not an editable representation of the each item.  To retrieve the
   source representation of the item, clients send a GET request to the

   URI found in each item's [@@ TBD XX r:edit element.  Derived
   resources are located by examining an item's r:link elements]

8.2.  POST

   A 2-Way RSS feed also accepts POST requests.  The client POSTs a new
   item to the RSS feed.  Some feeds only accept POST requests with
   certain media-types, so a POST request could result in a response
   with a status code of 415 ("Unsupported Media Type").  In the case of
   a successful creation, the status code is 201 ("Created").

   Example HTTP request creating a new item in a feed:

          POST /dilettante HTTP/1.1
          Host: example.org
          User-Agent: Cosimo/1.0
          Content-Type: application/rss+xml
          Content-Length: nnnn

          <item>
            <title>Chapter One</title>
            <description>It started out simple...</description>
            <guid>uuid:941e12b4-6eeb-4753-959d-0cbc51875387</guid>
            <link>http://example.org/chapter1.html</link>
            <pub:edit href="./item7.rss"/>
          </item>

   Example response.


          HTTP/1.1 201 Created
          Date: Mon, 21 Mar 2005 19:20:19 GMT
          Server: CountBasic/1.0

9.  2-Way Media RSS Feeds

   The items within 2-way Media RSS Feeds do not represent uniform types
   of content.  For example, they might contain podcasts, JPEG images,
   text documents, MPEG movies, or any other type of resource the server
   allows.

9.1.  GET

   2-Way Media RSS Feeds return an RSS feed much like the textual 2-Way
   RSS feeds described above, but with a few additions.  The entries

   also contain an <enclosure> element with a 'url' attribute pointing
   to the media object.  This URL can be used to edit the uploaded media
   object, using PUT and DELETE.  Such items may contain edit links used
   to edit the item metadata.[@@TBD As with any RSS item, related and
   derived resources can be located by inspecting an item's r:link
   elements.]

   An example 2-Way Media RSS Feed:

          <rss>
            <channel>
              <title>My Pics</title>
              <link>http://example.org/pics</link>
              <description>Recent photos.</description>
              <!-- 0 or more item elements follow -->
              <item>
                <title>beach25</title>
                <link>http://example.org/beach-pic1.html</link>
                <guid>uuid:941e12b4-6eeb-4753-959d-0cbc51875387</guid>
                <description>This was awesome.</description>
                <enclosure url="http://example.org/beach.tiff"
                           length="15234"
                           type="image/tiff" />
              </item>
            </channel>
          </rss>

   Implementations require that each such item contain either a <title>
   or <description> element.  The value for the <title> element will
   likely be provided by the client, as a way for users to associate
   their local objects with those they have uploaded to the server (see
   POST below).

9.2.  POST

   To add an item to a 2-Way Media RSS feed, clients POST the resource
   to the Media feed's URL.  Clients should provide a 'Title' request
   header to provide the server with a short string identifying the
   object to users.  Clients may include a 'Content-Description' header
   [RFC2045] providing a more complete description of the content.  In
   addition, servers may inspect the POSTed entity for additional
   metadata to be exposed in an <item> element when listed in a 2-Way
   Media RSS feed.  For example, the server might inspect a JPEG file
   for EXIF headers containing creator data.

10.  Service Outlines

   Many 2-Way RSS applications require a basic resource layout in order
   to ease configuration requirements.  Servers use Service Outline OPML
   documents to convey information about related groups of 2-Way RSS
   feeds.  On a blogging service, for example, each group might
   represent a distinct blog and associated resources.

   Example Service Outline document:

      <opml version="1.0">
        <head>
          <title>My Blogs</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <outline text="Pretending to be Excited" type="rss"
                   xmlUrl="http://example.org/pretend.rss"/>
          <outline text="Quick Links" type="rss"
                   xmlUrl="http://example.org/side.rss"/>
        </body>
      </opml>



Sayre                     Expires July 5, 2006                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                  2-Way RSS                   January 2006


   Servers are not required to expose a Service Outline OPML document,
   but experimental deployment experience has shown that a single
   document which signals some basic information about the server's
   configuration can greatly simplify client implementations.  The
   simplest useful Service Outline OPML document shows the location of a
   single feed:

      <opml version="1.0">
        <head>
          <title>Flickr</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <outline text="My Pics" type="rss"
                   xmlUrl="http://example.org/pics.rss"/>
        </body>
      </opml>

   If another 2-Way RSS feed is added, the document can be upgraded to
   reflect that.

      <opml version="1.0">
        <head>
          <title>Flickr</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <outline text="Pics" type="rss"
                   xmlUrl="http://example.org/pics.rss"/>
          <outline text="Overwraught Prose" type="rss"
                   xmlUrl="http://example.org/blog.rss"/>
        </body>
      </opml>

   Finally, more extensive services could require some amount of
   hierarchical grouping.
