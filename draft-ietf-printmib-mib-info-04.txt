1.  Introduction


1.1  Network Printing Environment

The management of producing a printed document, in any computer
environment, is a complex subject. Basically, the task can be
divided into two overlapping pieces, the management of printing
and the  management of the printer. Printing encompasses the
entire process of producing a printed document from generation of
the file to be printed, selection of a printer, choosing printing
properties , routing, queuing, resource management, scheduling,
and final printing including notifying the user.  Most of the
printing process is outside the scope of the model presented
here; only the management of the printer is covered.

1.2  Printer Device Overview

A printer is the physical device that takes media from an input
source, produces marks on that media according to some page
description or page control language and puts the result in some
output destination, possibly with finishing applied. Printers are
complex devices that consume supplies, produce waste and have
mechanical problems. In the management of the physical printing

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



device the description, status and alert information concerning
the printer and its various subparts has to be made available to
the management application so that it can be reported to the end
user, key operators for the replenishment of supplies or the
repair or maintenance of the device. The information needed in
the management of the physical printer and the management of a
printing job overlap highly and many of the tasks in each
management area require the same or similar information.


1.3  Categories of Printer Information

Information about printers is classified into three basic
categories: descriptions, status and alerts.


1.3.1  Descriptions

Descriptions convey information about the configuration and
capabilities of the printer and its various sub-units. This
information is largely static information and does not generally
change during the operation of the system but may change as the
printer is repaired, reconfigured or upgraded. The descriptions
are one part of the visible state of the printer where state
means the condition of being of the printer at any point in time.


1.3.2  Status

Status is the information regarding the current operating state
of the printer and its various sub-units. Status is the rest of
the visible state of the printer. As an example of the use of
status, a management application must be able to determine if the
various sub-units are ready to print or are in some state that
prevents printing or may prevent printing in the future.


1.3.3  Alerts

An Alert is the representation of a reportable event in the
printer. An event is a change in the state of the printer. Some
of those state changes are of interest to a management
application and are therefore reportable. Typically, these are
the events that affect the printer's ability to print. Alerts
usually occur asynchronously to the operation of the computer
system(s) to which the printer is attached. For convenience
below, "alert" will be used for both the event caused by a change
in the printer's state and for the representation of that event.


Turner                 Printer MIB V2                   [Page 10]

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



Alerts can be classified into two basic categories, critical and
non-critical.  A critical alert is one that is triggered by entry
into a state in which the printer is stopped and printing can not
continue until the condition that caused the critical alert is
eliminated. "Out of paper", "toner empty" and "output bin full"
are examples of critical alerts. Non-critical alerts are
triggered by those events that enter a state in which printing is
not stopped. Such a non-critical state may, at some future time,
lead to a state in which printing may be stopped.  Examples of
this kind of non-critical alerts are "input media low", "toner
low" and "output bin nearly full". Or, a non-critical alert may
simply provide information, such as signaling a configuration
changed in the printer.

Description, status and alert information about the printer can
be thought of as a data base describing the printer. The
management application for a printer will want to view the
printer data base differently depending on how and for what
purposes the information in the data base is needed.


2.  Printer Model

In order to accomplish the management of the printer, an abstract
model of the printer is needed to represent the sub-units from
which the printer is composed. A printer can be described as
consisting of 13 types of sub-units. It is important to note that
the sub-units of a printer do not necessarily relate directly to
any physically identifiable mechanism. Sub-units can also be a
set of definable logical processes, such as interpreters for page
description languages or command processors that set various
operating modes of the printer.

Figure 2 shows a block diagram of the printer and its basic 13
sub-units.

2.1  Overview of the Printer Model

The model has three basic parts: (1) the flow of a print file
into an interpreter and onto the marker, (2) the flow of media
through the marker and (3) the auxiliary sub-units that control
and facilitate the two prior flows.  The flow of the print data
comes through a physical connection on which some form of
transport protocol stack is running.  The data provided by the
transport protocol (interface) appears on a channel which is the
input to an interpreter. The interpreter converts the print data
into a form suitable for marking on the media.



Turner                 Printer MIB V2                   [Page 12]

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



The media resides in Input sub-units from which the media is
selected and then transported via a Media Path first to a Marking
sub-unit and then onto an Output sub-unit with (optionally) some
finishing operations being performed.  The auxiliary sub-units
facilitate control of the printer, inquiry/control of the
operator panel, reporting of alerts, and the adaptation of the
printer to various natural languages and characters sets. All the
software sub-units run on the System Controller which represents
the processor, memory and storage systems of the Printer.  Each
of the sub-units is discussed in more detail below.

All of the sub-units other than the Alerts report only state
information, either a description or a status. The Alerts sub-
unit reports event information.


2.2  Printer Sub-Units

A printer is composed of 13 types of sub-units, called groups.
The following sections describe the different types of sub-units.


2.2.1  General Printer

The general printer sub-unit is responsible for the overall
control and status of the printer. There is exactly one general
printer sub-unit in a printer. The general printer sub-unit is
represented by the General Printer Group in the model. In
addition to the providing the status of the whole printer and
allowing the printer to be reset, this Group provides information
on the status of the packaging of the printer, in particular, the
covers. The general printer sub-unit is usually implemented on
the system controller.


2.2.1.1 International Considerations

The localization portion of the general printer sub-unit is
responsible for identifying the natural language, country, and
character set in which character strings are expressed. There may
be one or more localizations supported per printer. The available
localizations are represented by the Localization table.

Localization is only performed on those strings in the MIB that
are explicitly marked as being localized.

The agent SHALL return all other character strings as coded
character sets in which code positions 0-127 (decimal) are US-


Turner                 Printer MIB V2                   [Page 13]

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



ASCII [US-ASCII]. Use of the remaining values, 128-255, is
discouraged because there is no method defined in the MIB to
determine the desired code position to character mapping and in
the future, these code positions may be used for a specific
encoding which would result in an agent utilizing these code
positions being incompatible with future implementations. Control
codes (code positions 0-31 and 127) SHALL NOT be used unless
specifically specified in the DESCRIPTION of the object.

The character set portion of the general printer sub-unit is
responsible for identifying the possible character sets that are
used by the interpreters, the operator console, and in network
management requests for display objects. There may be one or more
character sets per printer.  The understood character sets are
represented by the Character Set Table.


2.2.2  Inputs

Input sub-units are mechanisms that feed media to be marked on
into the printer. A printer contains one or more input sub-units.
These are represented by the Input Group in the model. The model
does not distinguish fixed input bins from removable trays,
except to report when a removable tray has been removed.

There are as many input sub-units as there are distinctly
selectable input "addresses".  For example, if a tray has an
option for manually feeding paper as well as automatically
feeding from the tray, then this is two input sub-units if these
two sources can be (must be) separately selected and is one input
sub-unit if putting a sheet in the manual feed slot overrides
feeding from the contents of the tray; that is, in the second
case there is no way to separately select or address the manual
feed slot.


2.2.3  Media

An input sub-unit can hold one or more instances of the media on
which marking is to be done. Typically, there is a large set of
possible media that can be associated with an input. The Media
Group is an extension of the Input Group which represents that
media that is in an input sub-unit. The Media Group only
describes the current contents of each input and not the possible
content of the input sub-unit.

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



2.2.4  Outputs

Output sub-units are mechanisms that receive media that has been
marked on. A printer contains one or more output mechanisms.
These are represented by the Output Group in the model. The model
does not distinguish fixed output bins from removable output
bins, except to report when a removable bin has been removed.

There are as many output sub-units as there are distinctly
selectable output "addresses".  Output sub-units can be addressed
in two different ways: (1) as a set of "mailboxes" which are
addressed by a specific mailbox selector such as a bin number or
a bin name, or (2) as a set of "slots" into which multiple copies
are collated. Sometimes both modes of using the output sub-units
can be used on the same printer.  All that is important from the
viewpoint of the model is that the output units can be separately
selected.


2.2.5  Finishers

A finisher is a sub-unit that performs some operations on the
media other than marking.  The finisher sub-units are represented
by the Finisher Group in the model.  Some examples of finishing
processes are stapling, punching, binding, inserting, or folding.
Finishing processes may have supplies associated with the
process.  Stapling, binding, and punching are examples of
processes that have supplies. A printer may have more than one
finishing sub-unit and each finishing sub-unit may be associated
with one or more output sub-units. Finishers are not described in
this MIB.

The exact interaction and sequencing between an output device and
its associated finisher is not specified by the model. It depends
on the type of finishing process and the exact implementation of
the printer system. This standard allows for the logical
association of a finishing process with an output device but does
not put any restrictions on the exact sequence or interaction
with the associated output device. The output and finisher sub-
units may or may not be separate identifiable physical mechanisms
depending on the exact implementation of a printer.  In addition,
a single output device may be associated with multiple finishing
sub-units and a single finishing sub-unit may be associated with
multiple output devices.

2.2.6  Markers

A marker is the mechanism that produces marks on the print media.
The marker sub-units and their associated supplies are
represented by the Marker Group in the model. A printer can
contain one or more marking mechanisms.  Some examples of
multiple marker sub-units are: a printer with separate markers
for normal and magnetic ink or an imagesetter that can output to
both a proofing device and final film. Each marking device can
have its own set of  characteristics associated with it, such as
marking technology and resolution.

In this model the marker sub-unit is viewed as very generalized
and encompasses all aspects of a marking process. For example, in
a xerographic process, the marking process as well as the fusing
process would be included in the generalized concept of the
marker. With the generalized concept of a marking process, the
concept of multiple marking supplies associated with a single
marking sub-unit results. For example, in the xerographic
process, there is not only a supply of toner, but there can also
be other supplies such as a fuser supply (e.g., fuser oil) that
can be consumed and replaced separately. In addition there can be
multiple supplies of toner for a single marker device, as in a
color process.


2.2.7  Media Paths

The media paths encompass the mechanisms in the printer that move
the media through the printer and connect all other media related
sub-units: inputs, outputs, markers and finishers. A printer
contains one or more media paths. These are represented by the
Media Path Group in the model.  The Media Path group has some
objects that apply to all paths plus a table of the separate
media paths.

In general, the design of the media paths determines the maximum
speed of the printer as well as the maximum media size that the
printer can handle. Media paths are complex mechanisms and can
contain many different identifiable sub-mechanisms such as media
movement devices, media buffers, duplex units and interlocks. Not
all of the various sub-mechanisms reside on every media path.
For example, one media path may provide printing only on one
surface of the media (a simplex path) and another media path may
have a sub-mechanism that turns the media over and feeds it a
second time through the marker sub-unit (a duplex path).  The
duplex path may even have a buffer sub-mechanism that allows

multiple copies of the obverse side to be held before the reverse
side of all the copies are marked.


2.2.8  System Controller

The System Controller is the sub-unit upon which the software
components of the Printer run. The System Controller is
represented in the model by the Host Resources MIB. This MIB
allows for the specification of the processor(s), memory, disk
storage, file system and other underlying sub-mechanisms of the
printer. The controller can range from simple single processor
systems to multiprocessor systems. In addition, controllers can
have a full range of resources such as hard disks. The printer is
modeled to have one system controller even though it may have
more than one processor and multiple other resources associated
with it.


2.2.9  Interfaces

An interface is the communications port and associated protocols
that are responsible for the transport of data to the printer. A
printer has one or more interface sub-units. The interfaces are
represented by the Interfaces Group of MIB-II (RFC 1213). Some
examples of interfaces are serial ports (with little or no
protocol) and Ethernet ports on which one might run InterNet IP,
Novell IPX, etc.


2.2.10  Print Job Delivery Channels

The print job delivery channel sub-units identify the independent
sources of print data (here print data is the information that is
used to construct printed pages and may have both data and
control aspects).  A printer may have one or more channels. The
channel sub-units are represented by the Print Job Delivery
Channel Group in the Model. Each channel is typically identified
by the electronic path and service protocol used to deliver print
data to the printer. A channel sub-unit may be independently
enabled (allowing print data to flow) or disabled (stopping the
flow of print data). It has a current Control Language which can
be used to specify which interpreter is to be used for the print
data and to query and change environment variables used by the
interpreters (and SNMP). There is also a default interpreter that
is to be used if an interpreter is not explicitly specified using
the Control Language. Print Job Delivery Channel sub-units can,
and usually are, based on an underlying interface.

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



2.2.11  Interpreters

The interpreter sub-units are responsible for the conversion of a
description of intended print instances into images that are to
be marked on the media. A printer may have one or more
interpreters. The interpreter sub-units are represented by the
Interpreter Group in the Model. Each interpreter is generally
implemented with software running on the System Controller sub-
unit. The Interpreter Table has one entry per interpreter where
the interpreters include both Page Description Language (PDL)
Interpreters and Control Language Interpreters.


2.2.12  Console

Many printers have a console on the printer, the operator
console, that is used to display and modify the state of the
printer.  The console can be as simple as a few indicators and
switches or as complicated as full screen displays and keyboards.
There can be at most one such console.  This console sub-unit is
represented by the Console Group in the model.  Although most of
the information displayed there is also available in the state of
the printer as represented by the various Groups, it is useful to
be able to query and modify the operator console remotely.  For
example, a management application might like to display to its
user the current message on the operator console of the remote
printer or the management application user might like to modify
the current message on the operators console of the remote
printer.  As another example, one might have a remote application
that puts up a pseudo console on a workstation screen. Since the
rules by which the printer state is mapped onto the console and
vice versa are not standardized, it is not possible to reproduce
the console state or the action of console buttons and menus.
Therefore, the Console Group provides access to the console. The
operator console is usually implemented on the system controller
with additional hardware for input and display.


2.2.13  Alerts

The alert sub-unit is responsible for detecting reportable
events, making an entry in the alert table and, if and only if
the event is a critical event, initiating a trap. The exception
to this rule is when the "alertRemovalofBinaryChangeEntry" trap
is generated. The alert sub-unit is represented by the Alerts
Group and, in particular, the Alert Table. This table contains
information on the severity, sub-unit, detailed location within
the sub-unit, alert code and description of each critical alert


Turner                 Printer MIB V2                   [Page 18]

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



that is currently active within the printer. Each reportable
event causes an entry to be made in the Alert Table.


2.2.13.1  Status and Alerts

Summary information about the state of the printer is reported at
three separate levels: (1) there is the status of the printer as
a whole reported in the Host Resources MIB, (2) there is the
status of various sub-units reported in the principle table of
the Group that represents the sub-unit, and (3) there are alert
codes reported in the Alert Table.


2.2.13.2  Overall Printer Status

Of the many states a printer can be in, certain states are more
"interesting" because of the distinct actions they are likely to
provoke in the administrator.  These states may be applied to the
printer as a whole, or to a particular sub-unit of the printer.
These named states are:

Non Critical Alert Active - For the printer this means that one
or more sub-units have a non-critical alert active.  For a sub-
unit, this means that the sub-unit has a non-critical alert
active.

Critical Alert Active - For the printer this means that one or
more sub-units have a critical alert active.  For a sub-unit,
this means that the sub-unit has a critical alert active.

Unavailable - The printer or sub-unit is unavailable for use
(this is the same as "broken" or "down" in other terminology).  A
trained service person is typically necessary to make it
available.

Moving on-line or off-line - The printer is either off-line, in
the process of moving off-line or in the process of moving back
on-line; for example on high end printers reloading paper
involves a transition to off-line to open the paper bin, it is
then filled and, finally, there is a transition back to on-line
as the paper bin is repositioned for printing.

Standby - The printer or sub-unit is not immediately available
but can accept new instructions.

Available - The printer or subunit is functioning normally.

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



Idle - The printer or subunit is immediately available.

Active - The printer or subunit is performing its primary
function.

Busy - The printer or subunit is performing a function (not
necessarily its primary function) and is not immediately
available for its primary function.

The Host Resources MIB (RFC 1514) provides three status objects
that can be used to describe the status of a printer: (1)
hrDeviceStatus in the entry in the hrDeviceTable; (2)
hrPrinterStatus in the hrPrinterTable; and (3)
hrPrinterDetectedErrorState in the hrPrinterTable.  These objects
describe many of the states that a printer can be in.  The
following table shows how the states named above can be
recognized by inspecting the values of the three printer-related
objects in the Host Resources MIB:

Printer       hrDeviceStatus hrPrinterStatus hrPrinterDetected-
Status                                       ErrorState

Busy/          running(2)     printing(4)

Non Critical   warning(3)     idle(3) or     could be: lowPaper,
Alert Active                  printing(4)    lowToner, or
                                             serviceRequested

Critical       down(5)        other(1)       could be: jammed,
Alert Active                                 noPaper, noToner,
                                             coverOpen, or
                                             serviceRequested

These named states are only a subset of the possible states -
they are not an exhaustive list of the possible states.
Nevertheless, several things should be noted.  When using these
states, it is not possible to detect when both critical and non-
critical alerts are pending - if both are pending, the Critical
Alert Active state will prevail.  In addition, a printer in the
Standby state will be represented in the Host Resources MIB with
a device status of running(2) and a printer status of other(1), a
set of states that don't uniquely distinguish this important
printer state.

Although the above mapping is workable, it would be improved with
a few additions to hrDeviceStatus and hrPrinterStatus in the Host
Resources MIB. In particular, it would be appropriate to add a
"standby" enumeration to hrDeviceStatus.  Similarly, it would be
useful to add the following states to hrPrinterStatus: "offline"
to indicate that reason for the printer being down (instead of
having to use "other") which allows both "warning" and "offline"
to indicate going offline and "down" and "offline" to indicate
offline and "notApplicable" to cover cases, such as "standby",
where the device state completely describes the state of the
device. The suggestions and additions discussed above would
require re-convening of the Host Resources MIB working group and
a new draft issued prior to actual implementation of these
suggestions and/or additions.

Detailed status per sub-unit is reported in the sub-unit status
fields.

         (e.g., a disk device driver) but that the device
         is still 'operational'.  An example would be high

         testing(4), indicates that the device is not
         available for use because it is in the testing

2.2.13.2.2  Sub-unit Status

Sub-unit status is reported in the entries of the principle table
in the Group that represents the sub-unit. For sub-units that
report a status, there is a status column in the table and the
value of this column is always an integer formed in the following
way

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



The SubUnitStatus is an integer that is the sum of 5 distinct
values, Availability, Non-Critical, Critical, On-line, and
Transitioning. These values are:


     Availability                           value

            Critical Alerts                 16

            State is Off-Line              32

    Transitioning

            Currently at intended state     0
            Transitioning to intended state 64

For example, an input (tray) that jammed on the next to the last
page may show a status of 27 (unavailable because broken (3) + a
critical state (16), jammed, and a noncritical state (8), low
paper).


2.2.13.3  Alert Tables

The Alert Group consists of a single table in which all active
alerts are represented.  This section provides an overview of the
table and a description of how it is managed.  The basic content
of the alert table is the severity (critical or non-critical) of
the alert, the Group and entry where a state change caused the


Turner                 Printer MIB V2                   [Page 24]

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



alert, additional information about the alert (a more detailed
location, an alert code, and a description), and an indication of
the level of training needed to service the alert.

The Alert Table contains some information that is redundant, for
example that an event has occurred, and some information that is
only represented in the Alert Table, for example the additional
information.  A single table was used because a single entry in a
group could cause more than one alert, for example paper jams in
more than one place in a media path. Associating the additional
information with the entry in the affected group would only allow
one report where associating the additional information with the
alert makes multiple reports possible. Every time an alert occurs
in the printer, the printer makes one or more entries into the
Alert Table. The printer determines if an event is to be
classified as critical or non-critical. If the severity of the
Alert is "critical", the printer sends a trap or event
notification to the host indicating that the table has changed.
Whether or not a trap is sent, the management application is
expected to poll the printer on a regular basis and to read and
parse the table to determine what conditions have changed, in
order to provide reliable information to the management
application user.


2.2.13.4  Alert Table Management

The alert tables are sparsely populated tables. This means the
tables will only contain entries of the alerts that are currently
active and the number of rows, or entries in the table will be
dynamic. More than one event can be added or removed from the
event tables at a time depending on the implementation of the
printer.

There are basically two kinds of events that produce alerts:
binary change events and unary change events. Binary change
events come in pairs: the leading edge event and the trailing
edge event. The leading edge event enters a state from which
there is only one exit; for example, going from running to
stopped with a paper jam. The only exit from this state is fixing
the paper jam and it is clear when that is accomplished.  The
trailing edge event is the event which exits the state that was
entered by the leading edge event; in the example above fixing
the paper jam is the trailing edge event.

It is relatively straightforward to manage binary change events
in the Alert Table. Only the leading edge event makes an entry in
the alert table.  This entry persists in the Alert Table until


Turner                 Printer MIB V2                   [Page 25]

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



the trailing edge event occurs at which point this event is
signaled by the removal of the leading edge event entry in the
Alert Table.  That is, a trailing edge event does not create an
entry; it removes the corresponding leading edge event. Removing
the leading edge entry may cause the unary change event
"alertRemovalofBinaryChangeEntry" to be added to the table.  With
binary change events it is possible to compute the maximum number
that can occur at the same time and construct an Alert Table that
would hold that many events. There would be no possibility of
table overflow and no information about outstanding events would
be lost.

Unfortunately, there are some events that are not binary changes.
This other category of event, the unary change event, is
illustrated by the configuration change event. With this kind of
event the state of the machine has changed, but to a state which
is (often) just as valid as the state that was left and from
which no return is necessary.  For example, an operator may
change the paper that is in the primary input source from letter
to legal. At some time in the future the paper may be changed
back to letter, but it might be changed to executive instead.
This is where the problem occurs. It is not obvious how long to
keep unary change event entries in the Alert Table. If they were
never removed, the Alert Table would continue to grow
indefinitely.

The agent needs to have an algorithm implemented for the
management of the alert table, especially in the face of
combinations of binary and unary alerts that would overflow the
storage capacity of the table.  When the table is full and a new
alert needs to be added, an old alert needs to be deleted.  The
alert to be deleted should be chosen using the following rules:


1. Find a non-critical unary alert and delete it.  If there
are multiple non-critical unary alerts, it is suggested that the
oldest one be chosen.  If there are no non-critical unary
alerts, then,

2. Find a non-critical binary alert and delete it.  If there are
multiple non-critical binary alerts, it is suggested that the
oldest one be chosen.  If there are no non-critical binary
alerts, then,

3. Find a critical (binary) alert and delete it.  If there are
multiple critical alerts, it is suggested that the oldest one be
chosen.  Agent implementers are encouraged to provide at least
enough storage space for the maximum number of critical alerts

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



that could occur simultaneously.  Note that all critical alerts
are binary.

In the event that a critical binary alert must be managed out of
the alert table; when space allows and the alert condition still
exists, the alert must be re-added to the alert table even if
there was no subsequent transition into the associated state. It
is recommended that this be done for non-critical binary alerts
as well. Note that the new alert entry will not have the same
index as the original entry that was moved out of the table.

Note that because the Alert Index is a monotonically increasing
integer there will be gaps in the values in the table when an
alert is deleted.  Such gaps can be detected by the management
application to indicate that the management application may want
to re-acquire the Printer state and check for state changes it
did not observe in the Alert Table.


2.3  Read-Write Objects

Some of the objects in the printer MIB report on the existence of
or amount of a given resource used with the printer.  Some
examples of such resources are the size and number of sheets of
paper in a paper tray or the existence of certain output options.
On some printers there are sensors that allow these resources to
be sensed.  Other printers, however, lack sensors that can detect
(all of) the properties of the resource.  Because the printer
needs to know of the existence or properties of these resources
for the printer to function properly some other way of providing
this information is needed.  The chosen way to solve this problem
is to allow a management application to write into objects which
hold the descriptive or existence values for printers that cannot
sense the values.  Thus many of the objects in the MIB are given
read-write access, but a printer implementation might only permit
a management operation to change the value if the printer could
not sense the value itself.  Therefore, the ability to change the
value of a read-write object may depend on the implementation of
the agent.  Note that even though some objects explicitly state
the behavior of conditional ability to change values, any read-
write object may act that way.

Generally, an object is given read-write access in the Printer
MIB specification if:

1. The object involves installation of a resource that some
printers cannot themselves detect.  Therefore, external means are
needed to inform the printer of the installation.  (Here external

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



means include using the operator console, or remote management
application) and

2. The printer will behave differently if the installation of the
resource is reported than the printer would if the installation
were not reported; that is, the object is not to be used as a
place to put information not used by the printer, i.e., not a
"sticky-note".  Another way of saying this is that the printer
believes that information given it and acts as if the information
were true.  For example, on a printer that cannot sense the size,
if one paper size is loaded, but another size is set into the
paper size object, then the printer will use the size that was
set as its current paper size in its imaging and paper handling.

The printer may get hints that it may not know about the
existence or properties of certain resources.  For example, a
paper tray may be removed and re-inserted.  When this removal and
insertion happens, the printer may either assume that a property,
such as the size of paper in the tray, has not changed or the
printer may change the value of the associated object to
"unknown", as might be done for the amount of paper in the tray.
As long as the printer acts according to the value in  the object
either strategy is acceptable.

It is an implementation-specific matter as to whether or not MIB
object values are persistent across power cycles or cold starts.
It is particularly important that the values of the
prtMarkerLifeCount object persist throughout the lifetime of the
printer.  Therefore, if the value of any MIB object persists
across power cycles, then the prtMarkerLifeCount object must also
persist.


2.4  Enumerations

Enumerations (enums) are sets of symbolic values defined for use
with one or more objects.  Some common enumeration sets are
assigned a symbolic data type name (textual convention).  These
enumerations are listed at the beginning of this specification.


2.4.1  Registering Additional Enumerated Values

This working group has defined several types of enumerations.
These enumerations differ in the method employed to control the
addition of new enumerations.  Throughout this document,
references to "enumeration (n)", where n can be 1, 2 or 3 can be



Turner                 Printer MIB V2                   [Page 28]

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



found in the various tables.  The definitions of these types of
enumerations are:

enumeration (1)  All the values are defined in the Printer MIB
specification (RFC for the Printer MIB).  Additional enumerated
values require a new RFC. Type 1 enumerations are typically used
where changes to the enumeration are either unlikely or will have
a significant impact on the structure of the MIB or
implementation of the MIB in management applications.

Some criteria that suggest using a type 1 enumeration are:

a) the set of values in the enumeration is thought to be known,
e.g., faceUp and faceDown

b) the enumeration defines a set of units of measure which must
be understood by a management application to be able to correctly
display the value of an object that measurement unit controls;
and

c) the enumeration is tied to the structure of the MIB or the
model on which the MIB is based, e.g., the prtAlertGroup
enumeration is tied to the OIDs for the related tables.

enumeration (2)  An initial set of values are defined in the
Printer MIB specification.  Additional enumerated values are
registered after review by this working group. The initial
versions of the MIB will contain the values registered so far.
After the MIB is approved, additional values will be registered
through IANA after approval by this working group. The current
set of approved values should always be obtained from the IANA
registry. Type 2 enumerations are typically used where it is
important to insure consistent usage of the enumeration values;
that is, to insure that the same entity does not get two
different enumerations values, or two different entities do not
get the same enum value.

enumeration (3)  An initial set of values are defined in the
Printer MIB specification.  Additional enumerated values are
registered without working group review.  The initial versions of
the MIB will contain the values registered so far.  After the MIB
is approved, additional values will be registered through IANA
without approval by this working group.  The current set of
approved values should always be obtained from the IANA registry.
Type 3 enumerations are used for enumerations that can be
extended without any controls; an example is the
prtMarkerSuppliesType, which can be extended as needed by any
manufacturer to describe the supplies required by a new printer.

3.  Groups from other MIB Specifications

This section identifies the groups from other MIBs that shall be
supported to supplement and complete a printer MIB
implementation. The section also describes some of the less
obvious characteristics of the Printer MIB structure that are
related to the inclusion of these other MIB groups




3.1  System Group

All objects in the system group of MIB-II (RFC 1213) shall be
implemented; however, as described in paragraph 3.4, implementers
should carefully consider what constitutes the "system".


3.2  System Controller

The storage and device groups of the Host Resources MIB (RFC
1514) shall be implemented to support the printer(s) system
controller, and any supporting devices. If deemed appropriate by
the implementer, other groups of the Host Resources MIB (System,
Running Software, Running Software Performance, and Installed
Software) may be implemented.

Because of the structure of the Host Resources MIB, the devices
constituting the system controller are at the same level as the
printer.


3.3  Interface Group objects

All objects in the Interfaces Group of MIB-II (RFC 1213) shall be
implemented for all print information interfaces to the printer,
including non-network interfaces.


3.3.1  Interface Types

The interfaces group of RFC 1213 contains only a partial list of
interface types that can be specified in the "ifType" object. For
a complete list of interface types, refer to the IANA registry at
"ftp://ftp.isi.edu/mib/ianaiftype.mib"

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



3.4  Implications involved with using external MIB groups

In structuring the Printer MIB, it is inconvenient to follow the
hierarchical structure implicit in the printer block diagram.
There are two reasons for this:

     1. Figure 2 suggests that the printer interface to the
network is through the interfaces group. It is generally required
that this network node is supported by an implementation of RFC
1213. However, the network node may support one printer or
several printers. Further, the SNMP agent may be within the
"system controller" (the printer controller board), or the SNMP
agent may be within a device completely external to the printer
system controller. Therefore, the relationship between the MIB-II
defined network node, the agent implementing the Printer and Host
Resources MIB, and the functional printer itself may not be
consistent with the structure suggested in figure 2.

     2. In many cases, the printer controller is a generic
computing device (PC or other standalone computer) containing
many of the resources of a standard host computer. This includes
devices such as memory, interfaces, network, and printer. The
Host Resources MIB has well developed structures for such
devices. However, the Host Resources MIB only deals with devices
associated with a single "host", and it considers the printer to
be a part of this host on the same level as memory, processor,
and other devices considered part of the "System Controller" of
the printer.

Therefore, it was convenient to conceive of a "host" associated
with the SNMP agent and with the network node by which the agent
and ultimately the printer(s) communicate with the network. All
host-resource devices communicating through this network node are
considered part of the host and are supported by implementation
of the Host Resources MIB Device and Storage group.

Another aspect of printer as a device consideration is that, not
only are the printer and the host resource devices constituting
the System Controller of the printer at the same level, but if
there are multiple printers, these printers and the Host Resource
devices constituting these printers are all at the same level,
whether the devices are dedicated to one printer or shared. The
functional hierarchy implicit in the printer block diagram is
therefore flattened with respect to host resource devices.

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



3.4.1  Host Resource MIB Device Group

For each instance of a host resource device, the following
attributes exist:

hrDeviceIndex, hrDeviceType, hrDeviceDescr, hrDeviceID,
hrDeviceStatus, and hrDeviceErrors.

The Device Description, Device ID and Device Status listed in
this table identify and characterize a printer. The hrDevice
index for each printer is included as an indexing value for
almost all variables in the Printer MIB. In the case of multiple
printers, the printer MIB appears as a composite MIB for all
printers considered part of this "host". Each table of the
printer MIB which includes hrDeviceIndex as an index will contain
the variables for each printer.

Non-printer devices listed in the table are associated with one
or more listed printer devices by the prtDeviceRefTable in the
printer MIB. This table, as most in the printer MIB, is indexed
by hrDeviceIndex; but unlike most of the other tables where the
devices of interest are printers, the devices of interest for
this table are non-printer devices. The only accessible object
for each row in this table is the device number of the printer
device which is associated with the indexed non-printer device.
The table includes a second index, prtDevceRefSeqNumber, which
allows a listed device to be associated with multiple printer
devices.

For example, a fully integrated printer may contain, as part of
its system controller, hrDeviceProcessor, hrDeviceNetwork,
hrDeviceDiskStorage, hrDeviceParallelPort, hrDeviceSerialPort,
hrDeviceVolatileMemory and hrDeviceNonVolatileMemory.

Ideally, these must all be listed as devices in the virtual host,
along with the printer (hrDevicePrinter) itself. Therefore, in
this example, eight devices would be included with hrDeviceIndex
values of "1 - 8". Since there is but one printer, the
prtDeviceRefTable in the printer MIB would contain seven entries,
each with a value identifying the printer hrDeviceIndex. Because
there is only one printer, devices are not shared and the
prtDeviceRefSeqNumber index is (1) in all cases.

Further, the Host Resource MIB defines device specific tables to
be supported for certain devices. These devices, and the primary
significance of the additional table(s) are:

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



hrProcessorTable: identification and significant characteristics
of processor

hrNetworkTable: correlates a network device to a MIB-II ifIndex
key

hrPrinterTable and hrPrinterErrorTable: the mechanism
communicating the status of each printer

hrDiskStorageTable: identifies disk access, media type and
capacity

hrPartitionTable: identifies "partitions" on long term storage
devices.

hrFSTable: identifies local file system type, characteristics and
parameters.


3.4.2  Host Resource Storage Group

Program and data storage exist both as physical devices in the
Host Resource Device Table, and as logical storage areas
supported in the Host Resource Storage Group. Logical storage is
listed and assigned an index in the hrStorageTable. Storage is
correlated to specific printers by the prtStorageRefTable in the
Printer MIB. This table is indexed by hrStorageIndex. The only
accessible object for each row in this table is the device number
of the printer device which is associated with the indexed
storage. The table includes a second index,
prtStorageRefSeqNumber, which allows logical storage to be
associated with multiple printer devices.


3.4.3  MIB-II Interface Group

The interfaces by which the printer receives print data are
identified within the Interfaces table of MIB-II (RFC 1213). In
the case of multiple printers, the network interface for the
"host" as well as all of the interfaces for all printers are
listed in this table. The interfaces may also be listed as
devices in the Host Resource Device Table. Network Port devices
are identified by MIB-II "ifIndex" objects to correlate them back
to the MIB-II interface table; no such provision exists for
"serial" and "parallel" ports. Interfaces listed in the Host
Resource device table may be correlated to specific printers in
the "host" by the prtDeviceRefTable in the printer MIB; this may
be useful if there are multiple printers. The "ifIndex" is also

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



used to identify the interface associated with each channel in
the Printer MIB "Print Job Delivery Channel" group. Therefore,
specific interfaces are also correlated back to specific printers
via the "channels" mechanism.

         "A coded character set value that specifies both a set
         of characters that may be used and an encoding (as one
         or more octets) that is used to represent the characters
         in the set. These values are to be used to identify the
         encoding employed for strings in the MIB where this is
         not fixed by the MIB.

         Some objects that allow a choice of coded character set
         are: the prtLocalizationCharacterSet object in the
         LocalizationTable and prtInterpreterDefaultCharSetIn.
         The prtGeneralCurrentLocalization and
         prtConsoleLocalization objects in turn contain the index
         in the LocalizationTable of the current localization
         (country, language, and coded character set) of the
         'description' objects and the console, respectively.

         The space of the coded character set enumeration has
         been divided into three regions. The first region (3-
         999) consists of coded character sets that have been
         standardized by some standard setting organization. This
         region is intended for standards that do not have subset
         implementations. The second region (1000-1999) is for
         the Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 coded character sets
         together with a specification of a (set of) sub-
         repertoires that may occur.  The third region (>1999) is
         intended for vendor specific coded character sets.

         NOTE: Unicode and ISO 10646 character coded data may be
         processed and stored in either Big Endian (most
         significant octet first) or Little Endian (least
         significant octet first) order.  Intel x86, VAX, and
         Alpha/AXP architectures are examples of Little Endian
         processor architectures. Furthermore, in environments
         where either order may occur, so-called Unicode BYTE
         ORDER MARK (BOM) character (which is ISO 10646 ZERO
         WIDTH NO BREAK SPACE), coded as FEFF in two octets and
         0000FEFF in four octets is used at the beginning of the
         data as a signature to indicate the order of the
         following data (See ISO 10646 Annex F).  Thus either
         ordering and BOM may occur in print data streams sent to
         the interpreter.  However, ISO 8824/8825 (ASN.1/BER)
         used by SNMP is quite clear that Big Endian order shall
         be used and BOM shall NOT be used in transmission in the
         protocol. Transmitting Unicode in Big Endian order in
         SNMP should not prove to be a hardship for Little Endian
         machines, since SNMP ASN.1/BER requires integers to be
         transmitted in Big Endian order as well.  So SNMP
         implementations on Little Endian machines are already

         reversing the order of integers to make them Big Endian
         for transmission via SNMP.  Also Unicode characters are
         usually treated as two-octet integers, not short text
         strings, so that it will be straightforward for Little
         Endian machines to reverse the order of Unicode
         character octets as well before transmitting them and
         after receiving them via the SNMP protocol.

         Where a given coded character set may be known by more
         than one name, the most commonly known name is used as
         the name of the enumeration and other names are shown in
         the comments.  The comments also indicate where to find
         detailed information on the coded character set and
         briefly characterize its relationship to other similar
         coded character sets.

         The current list of character sets and their enumerated
         values used to reference them is contained in the IANA
         Character Set registry.  The enum value is indicated by
         the MIB enum entry in the registry.  The enum symbol is
         indicated by the Alias that starts with 'cs' for
         character set.

         The IANA character sets registry is available via
         anonymous ftp.

         The ftp server is ftp.isi.edu. The subdirectory is /in-
         notes/iana/assignments/.

         The file name is character-sets.

         To add a character set to the IANA Registry:

         1. Format an entry like those in the current list,
         omitting the MIBenum value.
         2. Send the entry with a request to add the entry to the
         character set list to iana@ISI.EDU.
         3. The IANA will supply a unique MIBenum value and
         update the list."

         It is the responsibility of the management application
         in the system to determine how a particular alert is
         handled and how and to whom that alert is routed.  The
         following are the four training levels of alerts:

         Field Service - Alerts that typically require advanced
                         training and technical knowledge of the
                         printer and its sub-units. An example of
                         a technical person would be a
                         manufacturer's Field Service
                         representative, or other person formally
                         trained by the manufacturer or similar
                         representative.
         Trained -       Alerts that require an intermediate or
                         moderate level of knowledge of the
                         printer and its sub-units. A typical
                         examples of alerts that a trained
                         operator can handle is replacing

                         toner cartridges.
         Untrained -     Alerts that can be fixed without prior
                         training either because the action to
                         correct the alert is obvious or the
                         printer can help the untrained person
                         fix the problem. A typical example of
                         such an alert is reloading paper trays
                         and emptying output bins on a low end
                         printer.
         Management -    Alerts that have to do with overall
                         operation of and configuration of the
                         printer. Examples of management events
                         are configuration change of sub-units."

    DESCRIPTION
         "The code that describes the type of alert for this
         entry in the table. Binary change event alerts describe
         states of the subunit while unary change event alerts
         describe a single event. The same alert code can be used
         for a binary change event or a unary change event,
         depending on implementation. Also, the same alert code
         can be used to indicate a critical or a non-critical
         (warning) alert, depending on implementation. The value
         of prtAlertSeverityLevel specifies binary vs. unary and
         critical vs. non-critical for each event for the
         implementation.

         While there are some specific codes for many subunits,
         the generic codes should be used for most subunit
         alerts. The network management station can then query
         the subunit specified by prtAlertGroup to determine
         further subunit status and other subunit information.

         An agent shall not add two entries to the alert table
         for the same event, one containing a generic event code

         and the other containing a specific event code; the
         agent shall add only one entry in the alert table for
         each event; either generic (preferred) or specific, not
         both.

         Implementation of the unary change event
         alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801) is optional. When
         implemented, this alert code shall indicate to network
         management stations that the trailing edge of a binary
         change event has occurred and the corresponding alert
         entry has been removed from the alert table. As with all
         events, the alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801) alert
         shall be placed at the end of the alert table. Such an
         alert table entry shall specify the following
         information:

         prtAlertSeverityLevel   warningUnaryChangeEvent(4)
         prtAlertTrainingLevel   noInterventionRequired(7)
         prtAlertGroup           alert(18)

                                 change event that this event
                                 has removed.

                                 binary change event from the
                                 alert table.

         Optionally, the agent may generate a trap coincident
         with removing the binary change event and placing the
         unary change event alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEntry(1801)
         in the alert table. For such a trap, the prtAlertIndex
         sent with the above trap parameters shall be the index
         of the alertRemovalOfBinaryChangeEvent row that was
         added to the prtAlertTable; not the index of the row
         that was removed from the prtAlertTable."

    DESCRIPTION
         "Counts configuration changes within the printer. A
         configuration change is defined to be an action that
         results in a change to any MIB object other than those
         that reflect status or level, or those that act as
         counters or gauges. In addition, any action that results
         in a row being added or deleted from any table in the
         Printer MIB is considered a configuration change. Such
         changes will often affect the capability of the printer
         to service certain types of print jobs. Management
         applications may cache infrequently changed
         configuration information about sub-units within the
         printer. This object should be incremented whenever the
         agent wishes to notify management applications that any
         cached configuration information for this device is to
         be considered 'stale'. At this point, the management
         application should flush any configuration information
         cached about this device and fetch new configuration
         information.

         The following are examples of actions that would cause
         the prtGeneralConfigChanges object to be incremented:

         - Adding an output bin
         - Changing the media in a sensing input tray
         - Changing the value of prtInputMediaType

   DESCRIPTION
         "When the printer is not able to print due to a subunit

         the time-out, the printer will take the action specified
         by prtInputNextIndex.

         The event which causes the printer to enter the waiting
         state is product specific. If the printer is not waiting
         for manually fed media, it may switch from an empty
         subunit to a different subunit without waiting for the
         time-out to expire.

         A value of (-1) implies 'other' or 'infinite' which
         translates to 'wait forever'. The action which causes
         printing to continue is product specific. A value of (-

-- The Print Job Delivery Channel Group
--
-- Implementation of every object in this group is mandatory.
--
-- Print Job Delivery Channels are independent sources of print
-- data. Here, print data is the term used for the information
-- that is used to construct printed pages and may have both data
-- and control aspects. The output of a channel is in a form
-- suitable for input to one of the interpreters as a
-- stream. A channel may be independently enabled (allowing
-- print data to flow) or disabled (stopping the flow of
-- print data). A printer may have one or more channels.
--
-- The Print Job Delivery Channel table describes the
-- capabilities of the printer and not what is currently being
-- performed by the printer
--
-- Basically, the print job delivery channel abstraction
-- describes the final processing step of getting the print data
-- to an interpreter. It might include some level of
-- decompression or decoding of print stream data.
-- channel. All of these aspects are hidden in the channel
-- abstraction.
--
-- There are many kinds of print job delivery channels; some of
-- which are based on networks and others which are not. For
-- example, a channel can be a serial (or parallel) connection;
-- it can be a service, such as the UNIX Line Printer Daemon
-- (LPD), offering services over a network connection; or
-- it could be a disk drive into which a floppy disk with

-- the print data is inserted. Each print job delivery channel is
-- identified by the electronic path and/or service protocol
-- used to deliver print data to a print data interpreter.
--
-- Channel example                   Implementation

-- serial port channel            bi-directional data channel
-- parallel port channel          often uni-directional channel

--
-- It is easy to note that this is a mixed bag.  There are
-- some physical connections over which no (or very meager)
-- protocols are run (e.g. the serial or old parallel ports)
-- and there are services which often have elaborate
-- protocols that run over a number of protocol stacks. In
-- the end, what is important is the delivery of print data
-- through the channel.
--
-- The print job delivery channel sub-units are represented by
-- the Print Job Delivery Channel Group in the Model. It has a
-- current print job control language, which can be used to
-- specify which interpreter is to be used for the print data and
-- to query and change environment variables used by the
-- interpreters (and Management Applications). There is also a
-- default interpreter that is to be used if an interpreter is
-- not explicitly specified using the Control Language.

-- The first seven items in the Print Job Delivery Channel Table
-- define the "channel" itself.  A channel typically depends on
-- other protocols and interfaces to provide the data that flows
-- through the channel.
--
-- Control of a print job delivery channel is largely limited to
-- enabling or disabling the entire channel itself. It is likely
-- that more control of the process of accessing print data
-- will be needed over time. Thus, the ChannelType will
-- allow type-specific data to be associated with each
-- channel (using ChannelType specific groups in a fashion
-- analogous to the media specific MIBs that are associated
-- with the IANAIfType in the Interfaces Table). As a first
-- step in this direction, each channel will identify the
-- underlying Interface on which it is based. This is the

    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
         "Auxiliary information to allow a printing application
         to use the channel for data submission to the printer.
         An application capable of using a specific
         PrtChannelType should be able to use the combined
         information from the prtChannelInformation and other
         channel and interface group objects to 'bootstrap' its
         use of the channel.  prtChannelInformation is not
         intended to provide a general channel description, nor
         to provide information that is available once the
         channel is in use.

         The encoding and interpretation of the
         prtChannelInformation object is specific to channel
         type.  The description of each PrtChannelType enum value
         for which prtChannelInformation is defined specifies the
         appropriate encoding and interpretation, including
         interaction with other objects.  For channel types that
         do not specify a prtChannelInformation value, its value
         shall be null (0 length).

         When a new PrtChannelType enumeration value is
         registered, its accompanying description must specify
         the encoding and interpretation of the
         prtChannelInformation value for the channel type.
         prtChannelInformation semantics for an existing
         PrtChannelType may be added or amended in the same
         manner as described in section 2.4.1 for type 2
         enumeration values.

         The prtChannelInformation specifies values for a
         collection of channel attributes, represented as text
         according to the following rules:

         1. The prtChannelInformation is not affected by
         localization.

         2. The prtChannelInformation is a list of entries
         representing the attribute values.  Each entry consists
         of the following items, in order:

         a. a keyword, composed of alphabetic characters (A-Z,
         a-z) represented by their NVT ASCII [NVT ASCII] codes,
         that identifies a channel attribute,




Turner                 Printer MIB V2                  [Page 115]

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



         b. the NVT ASCII code for an Equals Sign (=) (code 61)
         to delimit the keyword,

         c. a data value encoded using rules specific to the
         PrtChannelType to with the prtChannelInformation applies
         which must in no case allow an octet with value 10 (the
         NVT ASCII Line Feed code),

         d. the NVT ASCII code for a Line Feed character (code
         10) to delimit the data value.

         No other octets shall be present.

         Keywords are case-sensitive.  Conventionally, keywords
         are capitalized (including each word of a multi-word
         keyword) and since they occupy space in the
         prtChannelInformation, they are kept short.

         3. If a channel attribute has multiple values, it is
         represented by multiple entries with the same keyword,
         each specifying one value. Otherwise, there shall be at
         most one entry for each attribute.

         4. By default, entries may appear in any order.  If
         there are ordering constraints for particular entries,
         these must be specified in their definitions.

         5. The prtChannelInformation value by default consists
         of text represented by NVT ASCII graphics character
         codes. However, other representations may be specified:

         a. In cases where the prtChannelInformation value
         contains information not normally coded in textual form,
         whatever symbolic representation is conventionally used
         for the information should be used for encoding the
         prtChannelInformation value. (For instance, a binary
         port value might be represented as a decimal number
         using NVT ASCII codes.) Such encoding must be specified
         in the definition of the value.

         b. The value may contain textual information in a
         character set other than NVT ASCII graphics characters.
         (For instance, an identifier might consist of ISO 10646
         text encoded using the UTF-8 encoding scheme.) Such a
         character set and its encoding must be specified in the
         definition of the value.

         6. For each PrtChannelType for which

         prtChannelInformation entries are defined, the
         descriptive text associated with the PrtChannelType
         enumeration value shall specify the following
         information for each entry:

         Title:        Brief description phrase, e.g.: 'Port
                       name', 'Service Name', etc.

         Keyword:      The keyword value, e.g.: 'Port' or
                       'Service'

         Syntax:       The encoding of the entry value if it
                       cannot be directly represented by NVT
                       ASCII.

         Status:       'Mandatory', 'Optional', or 'Conditionally
                       Mandatory'

         Multiplicity: 'Single' or 'Multiple' to indicate whether
                       the entry may be present multiple times.

         Description:  Description of the use of the entry, other
                       information required to complete the
                       definition (e.g.: ordering constraints,
                       interactions between entries).

         Applications that interpret prtChannelInformation should

         new entry types are added."

Appendix A - Glossary of Terms

Addressability - On the marker, the number of distinct marking
units (pels) per unit of addressability unit that can be set; for
example, 300 dots per inch is expressed as 300 per 1000
Thousandths Of Inches and 4 dots per millimeter is 4 per 1000
Micrometers. Addressability is not resolution because marks that
are one addressability position apart may not be independently
resolvable by the eye due to factors such as gain in the area of
marks so they overlap or nearly touch.

Alert - A reportable event for which there is an entry in the
alert table.

Bin - An output sub-unit which may or may not be removable.

Binary Change Event - An event which comes in pairs; the leading
edge event and the trailing edge event. The leading edge event
enters a state from which there is only one exit. A binary change
event may be critical or non-critical. See unary change event.

Bursting - The process by which continuous media is separated
into individual sheets, typically by bursting along pre-formed
perforations.

Channel - A term used to describe a single source of data which
is presented to a printer.  The model that we use in describing a
printer allows for an arbitrary number of channels.  Multiple
channels can exist on the same physical port.  This is commonly
done over Ethernet ports where EtherTalk, TCP/IP, and SPX/IPX
protocols can be supplying different data streams simultaneously
to a single printer on the same physical port.

Collation - In multiple copy output, placing the pages from
separate copies into separate ordered sets, ready for binding.

Control Language - A data syntax or language for controlling the
printer through the print data channel.

Critical Alert - An alert triggered by an event which leads to a
state in which printing is no longer possible; the printer is
stopped.

Decollating - The process by which the individual parts within a
multi-part form are separated and sorted into separate stacks for
each part.

Description - Information about the configuration and
capabilities of the printer and its various sub-units.

DPA - ISO 10175 Document Printing Application standard.  A
standard for a client server protocol for a print system,
including (1) submitting print jobs to and (2) managing print
jobs in a spooler.

Event - A state change in the printer.

Group - A collection of objects that represent a type of sub-unit
of the printer.

IANA - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.  See STD 2, RFC 1700.

Idempotent - Idempotence is the property of an operation that
results in the same state no matter how many times it is executed
(at least once).  This is a property that is shared by true
databases in which operations on data items only change the state
of the data item and do not have other side effects.  Because the
SNMP data model is that of operations on a database, SNMP MIB
objects should be assumed to be idempotent.  If a MIB object is
defined in a non-idempotent way, the this data model can break in
subtle ways when faced with packet loss, multiple managers, and
other common conditions.

In order to fulfill the common need for actions to result from
SNMP Set operations, SNMP MIB objects can be modeled such that
the change in state from one state to another has the side effect
of causing an action.  It is important to note that with this
model, an SNMP operation that sets a value equal to its current
value will cause no action.  This retains the idempotence of a
single command, while allowing actions to be initiated by SNMP
SET requests.

Input - A tray or bin from which instances of the media are
obtained and fed into the Media Path.

Interpreter - The embodiment of an algorithm that processes a
data stream consisting of a Page Description Language (PDL)
and/or a Control Language.

Localization - The specification of human language, country, and
character set needed to present information to people in their
native languages.

Management Application (a.k.a. Manager) - A program which queries
and controls one or more managed nodes.

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



Management Station - A physical computer on which one or more
management applications can run.

Media Path - The mechanisms that transport instances of the media
from an input, through the marker, possibly through media buffers
and duplex pathways, out to the output with optional finishing
applied.  The inputs and outputs are not part of the Media Path.

Non-critical Alert - An alert triggered by a reportable event
which does not lead to a state in which printing is no longer
possible; such an alert may lead to a state from which printing
may no longer be possible in the future, such as the low toner
state or the alert may be pure informational, such as a
configuration change at the printer.

Output - A bin or stacker which accepts instances of media that
have been processed by a printer.

Page Description Language (PDL) - A data syntax or language for
the electronic representation of a document as a sequence of page
images.

Printer - A physical device that takes media from an input
source, produces marks on that media according to some page
description or page control language and puts the result in some
output destination, possibly with finishing applied.

Printing - The entire process of producing a printed document
from generation of the file to be printed, choosing printing
properties, selection of a printer, routing, queuing, resource
management, scheduling, and finally printing including notifying
the user.

Reportable event - An event that is deemed of interest to a
management station watching the printer.

Status - Information regarding the current operating state of the
printer and its various sub-units. This is an abstraction of the
exact physical condition of the printer.

Sub-mechanism - A distinguishable part of a sub-unit.

Sub-unit - A part of the printer which may be a physical part,
such as one of the input sources or a logical part such as an
interpreter.

Tray - An input sub-unit which is typically removable.

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



Unary Change Event - An event that indicates a change of state of
the printer, but to a state which is (often) just as valid as the
state that was left, and from which no return is necessary. See
binary change event.

Visible state - The portion of the state of the printer that can
be examined by a management application.

Warning - A non-critical alert. See non-critical alert.

Appendix B - Media Size Names from ISO/IEC 10175 Document
Printing Architecture

For the convenience of management application developers, this
appendix lists the standardized media size names from ISO/IEC
10175 Document Printing Application (DPA). Management
applications that present a dialogue for choosing or displaying
media size are encouraged to present relevant names from this
list to avoid requiring the user to remember the physical
dimensions used to describe the size of the media. A printer
implementing the Printer MIB has no knowledge of these names,
however; all media sizes in the MIB are given in terms of media
dimensions as the values of prtMediaDimFeedDir and
prtInputChosenMediaDimXFeedDir.

Appendix C - Media Names

For the convenience of management application developers, this
appendix lists the standardized media names from ISO/IEC 10175
Document Printing Application (DPA). Management applications that
present a dialogue for choosing media may wish to use these names
as an alternative to separately specifying, size, color, and/or
type. Using standard media names will mean that a single
management application dealing with printers from different
vendors and under different system mangers will tend to use the
same names for the same media. If selection of media by name is
used, the attributes (size, type or color) implied by the name
must be explicitly mapped to the appropriate object
(prtInputDeclared-MediaDimFeedDir,
prtInputDeclaredMediaDimXFeedDir, prtInputMediaType and
prtInputMediaColor) in the MIB. The object prtInputMediaName is
intended for display to an operator and is purely descriptive.
The value in prtInputMediaName is not interpreted by the printer
so using a standard name for this value will not change any of
the other media attributes nor will it cause an alert if the
media in the input sub-unit does not match the name.

Appendix D - Roles of Users

Background

The need for "Role Models" stemmed in large part from the need to
understand the importance of any given proposed object for the
MIB.  Many times the real world need for a proposed object would
be debated within the group; the debate would typically result in
the need to describe the potential usage of the object in terms
of a "live" person performing some type of printing-related task.

Determining the value of a proposed object through identification
of the associated human users was found to be so common that a
more formalized model was required for consistent analysis.  The
model describing categories of human-oriented tasks is called
"Role Models" in this document.

In developing the Role Models it was necessary to identify the
common, primary tasks that humans typically face when interacting
with a printer and its related printing system(s).  It was
expected that certain kinds of tasks would serve to identify the
various Role Models.

In presenting the set of Role Models, the set of "Common Print
System Tasks" are first presented, followed by the set of Role
Model definitions.  Finally, a simple matrix is presented in
which Role Models and Tasks are cross-compared.

Common Print System Tasks

Upon researching the many tasks encountered by humans in dealing
with printers and printing systems, the following were found to
be pervasive within any operating environment:


Printer job state - Determine the status of a job without a
printer.

Printer capabilities - Determine the current capabilities of a
printer, for example, the available media sizes, two-sided
printing, a particular type of interpreter, etc.

Printer job submission - Submit a print job to a printer.

Printer job removal - Remove a job from a printer.

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



Notification of events - Receive notification of the existence of
a defined printer event.  An event can be of many types,
including warnings, errors, job stage completion (e.g., "job
done"), etc.

Printer configuration - Query the current configuration of a
printer.

Printer consumables - Determine the current state of any and all
consumables within a printer.

Print job identification - Determine the identification of a job
within a printer.

Internal printer status - Determine the current status of the
printer.

Printer identification - Determine the identity of a printer.
Printer location - Determine the physical location of a printer.

Local system configuration - Determine various aspects of the
current configuration of the local system involved with the
operation of a printer.

These "tasks" cover a large spectrum of requirements surrounding
the operation of a printer in a network environment.  This list
serves as the basis for defining the various Role Models
described below.

Proposed Role Models

Following is the list of "Role Models" used to evaluate the
requirements for any given Printer MIB object.  Note that the
keyword enclosed in parentheses represents an abbreviation for
the particular Role Model in the matrix described later in this
document.

User  (USER) - A person or application that submits print jobs to
the printer; typically viewed as the "end user" within the
overall printing environment.

Operator  (OP) - A person responsible for maintaining a printer
on a day-to-day basis, including such tasks as filling empty
media trays, emptying full output trays, replacing toner
cartridges, clearing simple paper jams, etc.

Technician  (TECH) - A person responsible for repairing a
malfunctioning printer, performing routine preventive

INTERNET DRAFT          Printer MIB              January 22, 1999



maintenance, and other tasks that typically require advanced
training on the printer internals.  An example of a "technician"
would be a manufacturer's Field Service representative, or other
person formally trained by the manufacturer or similar
representative.

System Manager  (MGR) - A person responsible for configuration
and troubleshooting of components involved in the overall
printing environment, including printers, print queues and
network connectivity issues.  This person is typically
responsible for ensuring the overall operational integrity of the
print system components, and is typically viewed as the central
point of coordination among all other Role Models.

Help Desk  (HELP) - A person responsible for supporting Users in
their printing needs, including training Users and
troubleshooting Users' printing problems.

Asset Manager  (AM) - A person responsible for managing an
organization's printing system assets (primarily printers).  Such
a person needs to be able to identify and track the location of
printing assets on an ongoing basis.

Capacity Planner  (CP) - A person responsible for tracking the
usage of printing resources on an ongoing basis for the purpose
of planning printer acquisitions and/or placement of printers
based on usage trends.

Installer  (INST) - A person or application responsible for
installing or configuring printing system components on a local
system.

Accountant  (ACCT) - A person responsible for tracking the usage
of printing resources on an ongoing basis for the purpose of
charging Users for resources used.

Matrix of Common Print System Tasks and Role Models

To better understand the relationship between the set of defined
"Common Print System Tasks" and the various "Role Models," the
following matrix is provided.

It is important to recognize that many of the tasks will appear
to be applicable to many of the Role Models.  However, when
considering the actual context of a task, it is very important to
realize that often the actual context of a task is such that the
Role Model can change.

For example, it is obvious that a "System Manager" must be able
to submit print jobs to a printer; however, when submitting a
print job, a person identified as a "System Manager" is actually
operating in the context of a "User" in this case; hence, the
requirement to submit a print job is not listed as a requirement
for a System Manager.

Conversely, while a "User" must be able to remove a job
previously submitted to a printer, an "Operator" is often
expected to be able to remove any print job from any printer;
hence, print job removal is a (subtly different) requirement for
both the "User" and "Operator" Role Models.

Appendix E - Overall Printer Status Table


The Status Table was generated first in landscape format and is
easier to read in this format. Because a table in landscape
format can not be included in this document, the table has been
converted into portrait format and split into three different
sections. The three sections are: 1) the hrDeviceStatus,
hrPrinterStuatus and hrPrinterDetectedErrorState for each state,
2) the prtAlertTable for each state and 3) the respective SubUnit
status for each state. The Status Table in landscape format can
be found in a file with a name similar to Top 25 Errors at
"ftp.pwg.org" in the directory /pub/pwg/pmp/contributions.

The following table defines a suggested relationship between
various printer states and the variables Printer hrDeviceStatus,
hrPrinterStatus, hrPrinterDetectedErrorState, prtAlertGroup,
prtAlertCode and various sub-unit status variables
(prtInputStatus, prtOutputStatus, prtMarkerStatus,
prtMediaPathStatus and prtChannelStatus). This table is the
recommended implementation of these variables. It is provided to
guide implementors of this MIB and users of the MIB by providing
a sample set of states and the variable values that are expected
to be produced as result of that state.

This information supplements that provided in Section 2.2.13.2
"Overall Printer Status". This is not an exhaustive list rather
it is a guideline. More detailed status, if needed, should be
obtained from the alert table and the sub-unit status variables.

The definition of PrtSubUnitStatusTC specifies that SubUnitStatus
is an integer that is the sum of 5 distinct values/states:
Availability, Critical, Non-Critical, On-line and Transitioning.
Thus when a non-critical alert or alerts are present the values
for Availability, On-Line and Transitioning will be summed with
the Non-Critical Alerts (8) value.

Security Considerations

The Printer MIB specifies a database and not necessarily a
protocol for accessing the database. With regards to the security
of the information within the database, it is anticipated that
the primary vehicle for accessing this data will be through the
use of the Simple Network Protocol (SNMP). SNMP Version 1 has
known security vulnerabilities due to the fact that only a "clear
text" community name is used for accessing MIB objects within a
particular entity. The IETF is pursuing much more robust security
mechanisms with regards to SNMP Version 2, with support
authentication, as well as privacy.

Where the operational capability of the printing device are
especially vulnerable or difficult to administer, certain objects
within the MIB have been tagged as READ-ONLY, preventing
modification. Further, for all READ-WRITE objects within the MIB,
the working group has included specific conformance guidelines
within this document stating that vendors are free to implement
these objects as READ-ONLY. This conformance allowance should
cover cases where specific vendor vulnerabilities may differ from
product to product. (See conformance section with regards to MIN-
ACCESS clauses).

It is the intention of the working group to delegate true
security mechanisms for accessing these MIB objects to the
overall SNMP Version 2 working group, but not to preclude
individual implementations from generating proprietary or
additional security mechanisms for SNMP Version 1.0 environments.
