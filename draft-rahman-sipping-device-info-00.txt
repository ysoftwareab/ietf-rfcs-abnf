Abstract 
    
   This document describes a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event 
   package to carry device information including device status and 
   device profile. Device status refers to a set of dynamic attributes 
   that describe device's operating state, availability, and location 
   information etc. Device profile on the other hand refers to a 
   limited set of static attributes including device type, name, format 
   type of status information, and model etc. of a particular device.

   Device status information is particularly important to networked 
   appliances due to its dynamic nature where a user agent would be 
   able to monitor the status of networked appliances from a remote 
   location and be notified of the changes of status.

Internet Draft               device-info                July 11, 2004 
 
 
1.   Introduction 
    
   The  Session  Initiation  Protocol  (SIP)  [1]  specific  event 
   notification mechanism provides a user agent with a way to subscribe 
   to and receive notifications of events within a SIP networks. SIP 
   also has the notion of event package. An event package is an 
   instantiation of a generalized event framework where a set of state 
   information to be reported by a notifier to a subscriber. Here we 
   define  an  event  package  for  device  status  and  device  profile 
   information. This event package can be used by a user agent who 
   would like to monitor the status of networked attached devices from 
   a remote location and be notified of the changes of status.  
    
   This document does not define a common format for device status 
   information. The format of device status information should be 
   vendor specific. Instead, we define a common format for device 
   profile information, which has an attribute that defines the vendor 
   specific format type of the device status information to be used for 
   that particular device. This event package defines a mechanism by 
   which a user agent can retrieve device profile information and then 
   use the format type of the device status information to request 
   status notifications. 
    
   This package is particularly important to retrieve the operating 
   status, availability, and location etc. of Networked Appliances. In 
   order to retrieve the operating status of a Networked Appliance, a 
   user agent will first subscribe for the common device profile 
   information of the appliance. In the notification message, the user 
   agent will receive the profile of the networked appliance, which 
   contains the name of vendor specific device status format. The user 
   agent will then subscribe for the vendor specific device status 
   attributes that correspond to the status of the appliance and in 
   response notification events will be generated to the user agent 
   with the values of the attributes the user has subscribed for. The 
   specific detail of this event package and the sequence of operation 
   are described in the later part of this document.

2.   Terminology and Conventions 
    
 
   Device Status: A set of dynamic attributes describing the operating 
   state, availability, and location information etc. of a device. 
    
   Device Profile: A limited set of static attributes including device 
   type, name, format of status information and model etc. of a 
   particular device to be used for identification purposes. 
    
   Networked Appliance (NA): The term Networked Appliance has been 
   defined in [7] as a dedicated function consumer device containing a 
   networked  processor. But  more  generally  it  is  any  non-general 
   purpose device (i.e., not a PC, Palm Pilot, PDA, etc.) that has a 
   network connection. Examples of NAs include:  lamps, refrigerators, 
   toasters, and TVs. 
 
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD 
   NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to 
   be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].  
    
    
3.   Scope and Limitations 
     
   Status information of a device is primarily the operating state, 
   availability and location of the device.  It is not the intent of 
   this draft to encode all these as status attributes and provide a 
   common format for all kind of devices.  In fact it would be very 
   difficult to define a single comprehensive ontology for all kinds of 
   Network-attached devices. The vendors can define their own device 
   specific status format. It is possible that a number of devices with 
   similar category MAY have the same status format. Even though we do 
   not define a common format for device status information but in this 
   document we define a basic set of static attributes that are common 
   to all kind of devices such as device name, type, manufacturer name, 
   name of the format of mode etc which we refer to as device profile 
   information.

4.   Event Package Definition 
    
   This section provides the details for defining a SIP specific event 
   package as defined in Section 5.4 of [2]. 
    
    
4.1. Event Package Name 
    
   The specification of SIP specific event package [2] requires event 
   package definition to specify the name of the Package. The token 
   name of this event package is:  
    
   "device-info" 
    
   This value appears in the event header present in SUBSCRIBE and 
   NOTIFY requests. 
    
   Example: 
    
   Event: device-info 
 
 
4.2. Event Package Parameters 
    
   No package specific Event header parameters are defined for this 
   event package. 
 
 
4.3. SUBSCRIBE Bodies 
    
   The SIP event specification [2] requires definitions of subscribe 
   bodies. The SUBSCRIBE message for device profile information does 
   not contain any body. A SUBSCRIBE for vendor defined device status 
   information MAY contain a body. The body will primarily be used for 
   the filtering of subscription. The definition of such subscription 
   body is outside the scope of this document. If the SUBSCRIBE message 
   does not contain any body then the default filtering policy will be 
   adopted. The rules for default filtering policy is as follows: 
    
     o Notifications are generated every time when there is a change 
        in the state of device status information. 
    
     o Notifications usually do not contain full state. They rather 
        indicate the state that has changed. However, notification 
        triggered from a response of SUBSCRIBE message will contain 
        full device status information.

4.4. SUBSCRIBE Duration 
    
   The  subscription  for  device  profile  information  is  a  one-time 
   subscription as device profile contains only static information and 
   does not change over time.  This one-time subscription is necessary 
   to find out vendor specific MIME type definition of device status 
   information, which can be used for subsequent subscription for 
   device status. So the "expires" header of SUBSCRIBE message for 
   device  profile  information  will  specify  "0"  duration  which  is 
   basically a fetch operation for device profile information. 
    
   Once,  device  profile  information  is  retrieved  using  the  fetch 
   operation, a subsequent SUBSCRIBE message should be sent to retrieve 
   device status information with "Accept" header indicating the vendor 
   specific MIME type name for the device status information. The event 
   package name for both device profile and status information is the 
   same, which is "device-info". A notifier can easily determine which 
   MIME type is requested from this subscription by looking at the 
   "Accept" header. The vendor specific MIME type name for device 
   status  information  will  be  contained  in  the  device  profile 
   information. The duration of subscription for device specific status 
   information May range from minutes to several hours. Subscriptions 
   in hours are more typical and recommended. The default subscription 
   duration for device status information is 1 hour. 
 
  
4.5. NOTIFY Bodies 
    
   The SIP specific event specification [2] requires package definition 
   to specify a set of allowed body types in NOTIFY message. RFC 3265 
   [2] also requires to specify the default value to be used when there 
   is no Accept header in the SUBSCRIBE request.  
    
   The body of notification message for a response to SUBSCRIBE message 
   for  device  profile  information  will  contain  Mime  Type  content 
   "application/device-profile+xml". As we are defining a single event 
   package for both device profile and device status information, the 
   determination of type of information is requested can be made by 
   looking at the Accept header of SUBSCRIBE message. As the Accept 
   header is being used to differentiate between data types, in order 
   to  implement  this  event  package  the  use  of  Accept  header  is 
   mandatory.

   The format of device status information is vendor specific and the 
   format of "application/device-profile+xml" has an attribute that 
   defines the name of the format to be used for the status information 
   of a device. The body of notification message for the status 
   information of a specific device will contain vendor specific Mime 
   content. This document does not define any vendor specific mime 
   format for any device. It is expected that individual device vendor 
   will register their device status specific Mime content with the 
   IANA. It is also possible to have the same device status format for 
   a number of devices of similar category.

8.   IANA Considerations 
    
   This memo calls for IANA to:  
   -  Register a new event package as per [2]. 
   -  Register a new MIME content-type application/device-profile+xml, 
      per [9], 
   -  Register a new XML namespace URN for device profile information 
      per [6].

9.   Security Considerations 
    
   The status information of a network-attached device MAY contain 
   sensitive information and hence a security mechanism is needed to 
   protect the content of status information document. We will consider 
   only securing the entire status document as element by element is 
   not required for the particular usage of the status document. Device 
   specific status information will be defined using MIME type by 
   individual  vendors  of  device  manufacturer.  S/MIME  [9]  provides 
   several security properties i.e., confidentiality, integrity and 
   authentication. S/MIME also provides end-to-end security. We do not 
   see any instance where device specific status information defined by 
   vendors needs to be modified in the middle by a proxy or a server 
   while communicating between two peers. So it is appropriate to use 
   S/MIME to provide end-to-end security.
