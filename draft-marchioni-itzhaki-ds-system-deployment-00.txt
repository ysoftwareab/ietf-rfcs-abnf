Abstract

   Most digital-signature system deployments require dedicated and 
   solution-specific user-enrollment procedures and user-enrollment 
   software[1], and mandate provisioning and distribution of physical or 
   software-based signature-key tokens to end users.  As deployed such 
   approaches create a high burden in logistics, cost, and help-desk 
   support.  They also introduce training obstacles for users and 
   systems administrators.
   
   This document describes the deployment architecture approach used by 
   ARX to provide secure and efficient digital signature services based 
   on its CoSign(r) solution.  The security solution's deployment 
   architecture is documented in the hope that other digital-signature 
   and PKI deployment efforts will deliver comparable efficiencies.


   [1] This is also true for deployments of non-standard proprietary 
       electronic signature solutions.

Internet-Draft     Digital Signature System Deployment   11 August 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document presents an approach to deploying digital signature 
   solutions or services that does not mandate use of a solution-
   specific or PKI-specific identity proofing policy, or enrollment 
   software.  Rather the approach leverages an organization's pre-
   established user and authentication policies, procedures, systems 
   and infrastructure to drive the management of end-user signature 
   credentials i.e., management of signature keys and certificates.  
   This document describes a deployment scheme implemented by 
   Algorithmic Research, Ltd (ARX) to provide secure, efficient 
   deployment of digital-signature capabilities that has a low 
   administrative burden, and minimum impact on end-users and 
   operations.

   The security solution employs:

      o  a NIST FIPS 140-2 level 3 certified server to provide 
         physical and programmatic confidentiality and integrity 
         protection for private keys and digital-signature operations;

      o  SHS to provide integrity protection of signed objects 
         (documents or data);

      o  triple-DES/AES to provide confidentiality and integrity 
         protection of private keys;

      o  X.509 v3 certificates and CRLs to ensure signature 
         verification and non-repudiation under 3rd-party applications;

      o  RSA (1024 to 4096-bit) to provide integrity and 
         non-repudiation protection of digital signatures on user-sign 
         data, and certificates and CRLs;

      o  TLS to provide confidentiality and integrity protection of 
         signature object hash values and signature blocks sent between 
         the application and FIPS server;

      o  PKCS#1 signature scheme to enable signature verification by 
         3rd-party applications;

      o  PKCS#7 signature scheme to enable signature verification by 
         3rd-party applications;

      o  PKCS#10 public-key certification requests to enable cross 
         certification or subordinate CA operation with 3rd-party CAs;

      o  PKCS#11, OASIS DSS, ASSP and CAPI interface options to allow a 
         diversity of 3rd party applications access to secure digital 
         signature services.

     Standard Operating Procedure              Protocol

  Figure 1.  Enrollment, and Key and Certificate Management Example.


2.1.1. Identity Proofing.  Most organizations have an established, 
   documented and standard operating procedure for identity proofing 
   that requires in-person verification.  These procedures are 
   typically under the control of either, e.g., the human-resources 
   department, or the supplier or customer screening departments.  When 
   a person's identity is verified (proofed) that person is enrolled in 
   the organization's established user/supplier/customer database, 
   typically either Microsoft Active Directory or other LDAP-enabled 
   database, and an identity credential is issued. The digital-
   signature capability deployment solution must not disrupt these 
   established policies, procedures and infrastructure.

2.1.2. Signature-User Enrollment.  The deployment virtualizes an 
   organization's established identity-directory services as the 
   registration authority (RA) (i.e., RA proxy) for the signature PKI.  
   [Note the deployment described here leverages a range of 
   pre-existing identity-credentialing systems to authenticate users 
   and manage their digital-signature credentials, i.e., signature key 
   pair and signature certificate].  All signature-key and 
   signature-certificate provisioning and management functions must be 
   performed transparently and securely for the end user and systems 
   administrator by a FIPS 140-2 level 3 server like the CoSign 
   appliance.

2.1.3. Registration Authority (RA) Proxy.  The appliance must listen to 
   a set of events on the user directory (e.g., new user, remove user, 
   change user details, etc.) and translate these routine 
   administrative operations into signature-key and 
   certificate-management events (e.g., generate key pair, revoke 
   private key, issue/revoke certificate, etc.), without the need for 
   additional PKI-specific administrator intervention.

Internet-Draft     Digital Signature System Deployment   11 August 2008


2.1.4. Key and Certificate Management.  The deployment provides a FIPS 
   140-2 level 3 network-attached multi-user server, like the CoSign 
   appliance.  Signature keys and certificates are generated stored and 
   managed inside the server, and private keys are never exposed 
   outside the secure enclosure.  The server can be viewed as a large 
   network-attached smart card that secures all users' signature 
   credentials and signature operations.  The FIPS server provides 
   hardware security for all the private keys and all private-key 
   operations without the need for personal-hardware tokens. 
   Furthermore users (and administrators) can only use their own 
   signature key(s) and have access to none other.  Access for key 
   usage is controlled by the authentication scheme chosen [see sec 
   2.2.3] and the FIPS 140-2 level 3 server.  The operational impact is 
   an elimination of the high burden in logistics, cost, help-desk 
   support and lack of user acceptance, associated with the purchase, 
   provisioning, distribution and management of individual public-key 
   hardware or software tokens.


2.1.5. Certificate Management Options.  Certificate management is 
   provided either by the FIPS appliance-embedded Certification 
   Authority (CA) or by one of two optional secure interfaces between 
   the appliance and a 3rd party CA.  There is an interface option 
   allows the embedded CA to be deployed as a subordinate CA via a root 
   signing procedure; and second option that allows the FIPS appliance 
   to act as an RA Proxy between the company's user management 
   infrastructure and the 3rd party CA.  Organizations then have the 
   option to securely and transparently manage and control their own CA 
   or get certificate-management services from a 3rd party CA/PKI.  
   Furthermore the systems administrator and users have no training 
   obstacles or added burdens related to PKI-service management or use, 
   no matter which CA option is deployed.

   Under this approach the organization need not change their current 
   policies, procedures, and systems for (a) identity proofing and 
   management, and (b) user enrollment/revocation.  Thus the deployment 
   of the digital-signature system and PKI does not negatively impact 
   established policy and infrastructure nor end-user and 
   administrative routines.

2.1.6. Revocation, CRLs and OCSP.  This approach mandates a user is 
   revoked by revoking their private key, i.e., their private key is 
   immediately deleted by the FIPS server.  Therefore, at the time of 
   revocation the user no longer has a capability to make even one more 
   signature, and so all signatures that verify with that user's 
   certificate are known to have been made when the user had valid 
   signature privileges, and not after.  At the time the private key is 
   revoked the user's certificate is also revoked and placed on the CRL.  
   However, the need to manage and reconcile CRLs under this approach 
   is less important resulting in a savings of processing, 
   administrative, and CRL-distribution overhead, and furthermore

   eliminating the need for OCSP responders.  This has an added benefit 
   in signature verification; the user need not be online to verify 
   signatures (see section 2.2.2. below).

2.1.7 Automatic Refresh: Keys and/or Certificates.  Since keys and 
   certificates are managed centrally the FIPS server can automatically 
   refresh keys (i.e., revoke old and generate new) and certificates 
   (i.e., issue new certificate with new validity period) upon 
   expiration without the delays or logistics issues associated with 
   key and certificate as managed on personal hardware tokens such as 
   smart cards or USB sticks.

2.1.8. Re-keying.  As security policies evolve it may become necessary 
   to migrate from 1024-bit RSA to 2048-bit RSA, or, from RSA to 
   Elliptic Curve DSS.  Other deployment approaches mandate the 
   provisioning and distribution of physical personal signature-key 
   media, like smart cards and USB sticks.  These deployments leave the 
   administrator with a serious logistics burden for re-keying.  Under 
   such deployments the administrator would need to provision new key 
   tokens for each user and then carefully manage the timing of their 
   activation and swapping with tokens already in the hands of the end 
   users.

   In the event that re-keying is required for signature keys the 
   deployment approach offers a most efficient method to re-
   keying the user community.  Since no personal signature-key media 
   has been distributed (see section 2.2.1. below), all users can be 
   re-keyed at once from the central network-attached FIPS server 
   without delay or logistical issues.

2.2.1. Key and Signature Services for the Application.  The FIPS 
   server 'appears' either as a local CSP key media (i.e., USB stick or 
   smart card) to 3rd party desktop applications, or as a Web service 
   to any Web application.

   The FIPS server must present itself to the desktop application as 
   either as a standard CAPI cryptographic service provider (CSP), or a 
   Web service, or a PKCS#11 signature and key-service provider.  
   Standard Web service options include either OASIS digital signatures 
   service (DSS) or Adobe Signature Service Protocol (ASSP).

   The functions normally provided by a software token, public-key 
   smart card or USB stick, (i.e., secure key generation, key storage, 
   RSA signature operation, certificate storage, etc.) are provided by 
   the FIPS 140-2 level 3 network-attached server via the interfaces 
   indicated above.

Internet-Draft     Digital Signature System Deployment   11 August 2008


2.2.2. Signature and Verification Process.  Documents (or data) may be 
   hashed on the user's personal computer, or optionally, within the 
   FIPS server.  At the initiation of a signature operation an 
   authenticated TLS session is established between the user's PC and 
   the FIPS server.  A TLS session is established only after the user 
   (i.e., the signer) has been authenticated by answering an identity 
   challenge.  The TLS session protects the confidentiality and 
   integrity of the hash sent to the server and the signature block and 
   certificate returned to user's application.  The signature block and 
   certificate are then embedded in the signed document so that when 
   the signature needs to be validated all that is needed is the signed 
   document itself and the software (e.g., Adobe Reader) to calculate 
   signature verification.

2.2.3. User Authentication.  A number of options for identity challenge 
   must be supported, this to avoid disruption in pre-existing user 
   authentication policy and infrastructure, the options must include: 
   (a) Kerberos SSO,(b) simple username/password-PIN, and (c) the 
   following two-factor authentication options: (i) RADIUS protocol 
   with one-time password token, (ii) challenge-response protocol with 
   identity smart card, and (iii) biometrics. The organization can 
   therefore choose a level of user-authentication security that 
   matches the requirements of their application but nothing less 
   secure than what is needed is made available under the deployment.

2.2.4. Programmatic Interfaces for Application Customization.  Standard 
   interfaces and APIs provided by the deployment mean deployments 
   cost-effectively fit digital signature capabilities into pre-
   existing and new applications and identity-management 
   infrastructures. Another advantage is standard interfaces allow one 
   vendor's solution to be replaced with another with less disruption.

   The deployment must also consider what is familiar to end-users in 
   terms of visual indication of a signature.  Therefore there must be 
   support for a one-time capture and centrally stored handwritten 
   graphical-electronic signature image(s) (e.g., from an 
   electronic-signature-pad interface or by loading the image from 
   a .jpg or .bmp file) for placement with every digital signature.  
   This to provide an added visual convenience to end users, and more 
   importantly further encourage user adoption and routine use of 
   standard digital signatures.

   When needed standard APIs and Web services provide the 
   following functions for customized signature-enabled application 
   development:

      - Sign/validate signatures within supported applications
      - Sign/validate a single file or data buffer
      - Check certificate validity
      - Enumerate/manage certificates
      - Manage graphical electronic signatures 
      - Manage users

Conclusion.

   Deployment and management of large distributed systems of any kind 
   is extremely hard and digital-signature systems are no exception.  
   PKI technology remains wanting for affordable deployment recipes 
   that also consider pre-existing user-management and application 
   infrastructure.  The expected outcome of using the approach 
   presented here is the gap between PKI-driven applications and the 
   mass market will be further narrowed.
