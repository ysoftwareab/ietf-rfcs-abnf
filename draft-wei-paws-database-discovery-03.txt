1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivations

   In the PAWS protocol, the master device queries the database for
   available spectrum, but it MUST determine the URL for the database
   before it can send any PAWS messages.  Brief discussions of database
   discovery can be found in [RFC6953] and [PAWS PROTOCOL].

   Different regulatory domains might deploy their own WSDB and several
   WSDBs might be deployed in the same regulatory domain, so before
   querying the WSDB master device should find out which WSDB can
   provide service for it.  And there are some WSDB discovery scenarios.

   S1: Master device locates in its own regulatory domain, master device
   needs to know the available WSDBs that can provide service for it in
   the regulatory domain.

   S2: In the regulatory domain, when some WSDBs are not available any
   more or some new WSDBs are setup, master device should accommodate to
   the change of available WSDBs.

   S3: A portable master device could move from its home regulatory
   domain to a different regulatory domain, and it should find available
   WSDB in target regulatory domain.  For example, when a person, named
   Bob, travels and takes a Wi-Fi AP (could be integrated with laptop
   PC) with him, if there is a port of wired network, it is easy for him
   to setup a wireless network for use.  But if Bob takes an AP using
   white space spectrum, it must find an available WSDB in that
   regulatory domain before setup the wireless network.

   Several different methods could be used for master device to
   determine the appropriate URL(s) for connection.  Here we list some
   possible methods for this purpose (not all methods are included
   here):

   M1: The manufacture or the user of master device can manually pre-
   configure statically the URL(s) of one or more WSDBs that is
   available for master device to query white space spectrum (e.g.
   master device and WSDB have agreements with each other.).  For
   example, if master device is to be used in U.S., it will be
   configured with the WSDB of U.S., and then it directly connects to
   the WSDB in U.S., or if master device is to be used in several
   countries it can be configured with different WSDBs for each country.

   M2: Master device might be configured by certain provisioning process
   after attaching to operator's network.  The provisioning process
   might be DHCP process, OSS process etc.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title                   Jan 2014


   M3: An entity of Listing server [PAWS PROTOCOL], providing the URLs
   for one or more WSDBs, could be deployed in a regulatory domain, then
   master device queries and checks available WSDBs from the Listing
   server.

   M4: When WSDB, which master device currently connects to, cannot
   provide service any more, it can redirects the master device to
   another WSDB that can provide service [PAWS PROTOCOL].

   But in some scenarios the methods above may not work very well:

   (1) To pre-configure master device, the user has to know the
   available WSDB (s) that can be used in the regulatory domain, it may
   be inconvenient especially when master device is moved to a different
   regulatory domain.

   (2) It is possible that some WSDBs are not available any more or some
   new WSDBs are setup, the pre-configuring and provisioning method may
   not cope with it very well.

   (3) In pre-configuring method, it is possible for master device to be
   pre-configured with available WSDB of several regulatory domains.
   But master device must decide which regulatory domain it locates in
   before choosing the available WSDB.

   (4) The network provision method might work well only in case of
   WSDBs are maintained by network operators or there should be some
   agreement relationship between network operator and WSDB maintainer.

   (5) In the method that WSDB provides redirecting to the master
   device, some security related issues have to be considered.  It might
   be feasible for a WSDB to provide master device with URL of another
   WSDB in the same regulatory domain.  But in case when master device
   moves from regulatory domain A to regulatory domain B, it might seem
   not right for WSDB of A to provide regulatory domain information and
   available WSDBs or Listing server of B to the master device, because
   WSDB and master devices are each certified to operate in certain
   regulatory domains.

   At power-up master device does not reliably know the regulatory
   domain corresponding to its current location, and therefore does not
   reliably know with which WSDB(s) it can communicate to.  Furthermore
   it is essential that master device connects with a trusted WSDB for
   proper operation and indeed regulatory compliance.

   So a dynamic WSDB discovery mechanism is provided here, the mechanism
   can be used independently or cooperate with other methods, e.g.
   master device could first connect to the configured or provisioned

   WSDB, if that fails then the master device can use the dynamic
   mechanism described in this document to find out available WSDB.

   The dynamic WSDB discovery mechanism is used by master device to
   discover available WSDBs for its current location and related
   regulatory domain information.  After master device gets the
   information about available WSDB and regulatory domain information,
   it then chooses the proper WSDB for querying white space spectrum
   using PAWS procedures.

   The discovery mechanism discussed here will provide master device
   with two kinds of information: the regulatory domain where the device
   currently locates and the available list of WSDBs or a Listing server
   in current domain.

   The mechanism discussed in this memo will be provided as an OPTIONAL
   method as described in [PAWS PROTOCOL].


2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

   The terminology from PAWS: problem statement, use cases and
   requirements RFC6953 [RFC6953] is applicable to this document.

   Master Device

   A device that queries the database, on its own behalf and/or on
   behalf of a slave device, to obtain available spectrum information.

   White Space Database (WSDB)

   In the context of white space and cognitive radio technologies, the
   database is an entity which contains, but is not limited to, current
   information as required by the regulatory policies about available
   spectrum at any given location and time, and other types of related
   (to the white space spectrum) or relevant information.

   White Space Database Discovery Server (WSDB DS)

   A server function provided to a white space device, the client.  The
   white space device contacts a WSDB DS to receive the service of
   discovering or identifying one or more white space databases.

   RB_server

   Master device can query its current regulatory body domain
   information from RB_server.  RB_server setup by vendor or by third
   party.  Besides regulatory domain information, RB_server might
   provide additional information (TBD).

   LoST

   LoST (Location-to-Service Translation Protocol)RFC5222 [RFC5222] is
   an XML-based protocol for mapping service identifiers and geodetic or
   civic location information to service contact URIs and associated
   information.


3.  Solutions

   Considering of different business models, regulations in different
   regulatory domain and some existing deployments, in this version of
   draft, several possible solutions are discussed.

   [NOTE1: Although several solutions are discussed here, but finally we
   may only choose the best one.]

3.1.  Solution 1

   It's reasonable for the regulatory body to know all the WSDBs
   deployed in its domain, because when a WSDB is deployed it must get
   the permission of regulatory body.  So it is suitable for each
   regulatory body to deploy a WSDB DS.

   In this solution, each regulatory body maintains its own WSDB DS,
   which records all the WSDBs for the regulatory domain.  When master
   device operates in certain regulatory domain, it gets available WSDB
   from regulatory domain's WSDB DS.

   Besides WSDB DS deployed by each regulator body, an entity named
   RB_Server is also deployed.  RB_Server is a server which provides
   WSDB DS information to master device according to geo-location
   provided by master device.  The DNS domain name or IP address of
   RB_Server should pre-configured in master device.  There are two
   considerations on how to deploy RB_Server.

   (a) RB_Server(s) could be setup according to international agreement
   among various spectrum regulators.  In this case a query protocol
   between master device and RB_Server is needed, and LoST protocol
   would be an appropriate candidate.  RB_Server and WSDB DS act as LoST
   server and master device acts as LoST client.

   (b) Absent such an international agreement, each radio vendor would

   be responsible (under its certification agreement with each
   regulator) to ensure that its devices operate properly when they are
   in the geographic territory for which they have been certified,
   RB_Server could be setup by the vendor of master device, and each
   vendor's RB_Server provides service to its own master device.

   An example of deployment is shown in Figure 1.  There are three
   regulatory domains, named A, B and C; one or more WSDBs and one WSDB
   DS are deployed in each domain.

             Figure 1: Solution 1: Framework of WSDB discovery

3.2.  Solution 2

   This solution provides a more flexible WSDB discovery method.  In
   this solution, RB_Server and DNS system are used.

   It is possible that regulatory bodies get an agreement each one
   deploys its own WSDB DS, and under such an agreement solution1 would
   be a good choice for WSDB discovery.  But if regulatory bodies cannot
   reach such an agreement, i.e. not all regulatory bodies would deploy
   WSDB DS, then solution2 would be a good choice.  The framework of
   WSDB discovery for solution 2 is shown in Figure 2.

   In this solution, NAPTR DNS Resource Record (RR) RFC3403 [RFC3403] is
   used .  Each regulator maintains NAPTR RRs by itself, and every WSDB
   or WSDB DS has a related NAPTR RR.  The service field of NAPTR RR is
   used to indicate whether the RR is for WSDB or WSDB DS.  An example
   of NAPTR RRs is shown as follows.  [NOTE2: If NAPTR RR for WSDB DS
   exists, then there might be no NAPTR RRs for WSDBs.]

   A simple NAPTR example:

   paws.fcc.gov

   IN NAPTR 100 100 A paws-db '' exam1.company1.com ; DB returned

   IN NAPTR 100 100 A paws-ds '' exam2.company2.com ; WSDB DS returned

   IN NAPTR 100 100 A paws-db '' exam3.company3.com ; DB returned

   There is a bit of difference between RB_Servers in solution 2 and

   solution 1, in solution 2 RB_Server returns DNS domain name for the
   regulatory domain, which will be used in the following DNS procedure.

3.3.  Solution 3

   In this solution, WSDB DS is deployed independently from regulatory
   domain (but we don't except regulatory body from deploying their own
   WSDB DS).  WSDB DS maintains WSDBs for regulatory domains or only
   maintains WSDB DS in case regulator deploys WSDB DS by itself and
   needs master device get WSDB from its own WSDB DS.  The DNS domain
   name or IP address of such an independent WSDB DS should be pre-
   configured in master device.  An example of deployment is shown in
   Figure 4.

             Figure 4: Solution 3: Framework of WSDB discovery

   There are two considerations on how to deploy independent WSDB DS.

   (a) WSDB DS could be setup according to international agreement among
   various spectrum regulators.  In this case a query protocol between
   master device and WSDB DS is needed, and LoST protocol would be an
   appropriate candidate.  Both independent WSDB DS and WSDB DS deployed
   by regulatory body act as LoST server and master device acts as LoST
   client.

   (b) Absent such an international agreement, each radio vendor would
   be responsible (under its certification agreement with each
   regulator) to ensure that its devices operate properly when they are

   in the geographic territory for which they have been certified, WSDB
   DS could be setup by the vendor of master device, and each vendor's
   WSDB DS provides service to its own master device.

3.4.  Solution 4

   Like solution1, in this solution each regulatory body deploys its own
   WSDB DS.  A LoST service wsdb is defined, which is used to get URL of
   WSDB, and WSDB DS acts as a server that can provide wsdb service.
   Master device acts as LoST client.

   One DHCP extension has been defined in RFC5223 for discovering LoST
   server, so when master device attaches to operator's network, master
   device could be provisioned with IP address of an LoST server through
   DHCP procedure.  The LoST server provisioned here might not be the
   address of WSDB DS, but according to LoST architecture, master device
   can finally connect to WSDB DS after iterative or recursive
   procedures.
