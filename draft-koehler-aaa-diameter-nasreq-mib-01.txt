Abstract

   This document describes the Diameter application that is used for AAA
   in a PPP/SLIP Dial-Up and Terminal Server Access environment.  This
   application, combined with the base protocol, satisfies the
   requirements defined in the NASREQ AAA criteria specification and the
   ROAMOPS AAA Criteria specification.

   This draft defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module which
   describes the minimum amount of objects needed to manage the
   implementation of the Diameter NASREQ Application.

Internet-Draft            Diameter NASREQ MIB              February 2002


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   Diameter NASREQ Application.  The Diameter NASREQ Application is used
   for AAA in a general dial-up environment and, along with the base
   protocol, satisfies requirements defined in the NASREQ AAA criteria
   specification and the ROAMOPS AAA Criteria specification.  It is
   designed to ease the transition from systems that use RADIUS to
   Diameter by re-using the RADIUS address space, avoiding attribute
   lookups [16].

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 15, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC
        2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the
        SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [9] and RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC
        2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
        [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [17].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3.  Overview

   The Diameter NASREQ Application is used for AAA in general dial-up
   and Terminal Server Access environments.  It is designed to work in
   combination with the Diameter base protocol specification [18].

   The MIB defined reports objects that are specific to the NASREQ
   application as defined in [16].  The MIB specification for the
   Diameter base MIB [18] SHOULD be implemented prior to the
   implementation of this MIB.

6.  Security Considerations

   There is a managed object defined in this MIB that has a MAX-ACCESS
   clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such an object may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   There is a managed object in this MIB that may contain sensitive
   information. It is:

   diameterHostAddress,
             This can be used to determine the address of the Diameter



Koehler et al.                                                [Page 14]

             host server, with which the servers are communicating.
             This information could be useful in impersonating the
             peer server.

   It is thus important to control GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as
   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET (read) the
   objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
