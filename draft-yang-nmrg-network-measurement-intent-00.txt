1.  Introduction

   Since the development and implementation of intent based network
   (IBN) cannot be separated from accurate network state perception,
   accurate on demand network measurement technology is becoming more
   and more important.  The combination of network measurement
   technology and IBN can achieve network performance acquisition based
   on user/network administrator intent-based, verify whether network
   measurement results meet the measurement intent, and further improve
   the accuracy of the configuration in IBN.

   As the rise of IBN, different groups have different definitions of
   intent.  For example, in [I-D.irtf-nmrg-ibn-concepts-definitions]
   defines intent as intent fulfillment and intent assurance.  However,
   all different definitions of intent have some common characteristics,
   and can be classified according to
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-ibn-intent-classification].  And in order to combine
   the network measurement intent with the existing drafts of IBN, we
   define the components of the network measurement intent processing
   process as follows:

   o  Intent Translation

   o  Intent Orchestration and pre-Verification

   o  Data Collection

   o  Intent Compliance Assessment

   At the same time, according to
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-ibn-concepts-definitions], network measurement intent
   can be classified as network intent, operational task intent or some
   other kinds of intent.  And a detailed flow of network measurement
   intents will be given

2.  Network Measurement Intent

   Network measurement intent refers to the on-demand measurement of the
   network state based on the user/network operators' perceived intent
   of the network state.  We will present the detailed process of it
   within each part and we will take the measurement of busy network
   performance as an example.

   o  Intent Translation.  In this function, network measurement intents
      need to be translated into actions and requests taken against the
      network.  In the measurement of busy network performances, due to
      dynamic changes such as daily network bandwidth occupancy rate,
      the period of network busy time is not fixed.  As a result, Intent
      Translation can determine the threshold when the network state is
      busy on the same day based on the historical data learned by AI.
      And then determines the content to be measured.

   o  Intent Orchestration and pre-Verification.  In this function,
      Intent Orchestration and pre-Verification determines the
      measurement scheme according to the required measurement content
      and equipment support degree, and verifies whether the measurement
      scheme is feasible.  At the same time, it also needs to determine
      whether the network is busy according to the current network
      state.  While the busy time threshold is exceeded, this function
      performs automatic network deployment, such as in CLI mode.

   o  Data Collection.  This function is responsible for collecting data
      while determining the network is busy according to the current
      network state.  And more importantly, this data collection process
      should start automatically.

   o  Intent Compliance Assessment.  At the end, this function verifies
      whether the threshold meets the requirement and whether the
      network measurement intent is satisfied.  If either of the two
      conditions is not satisfied, the network measurement intent will
      be modified and re-enter the Intent Orchestration and pre-
      Verification.

3.  Summary

   This memo introduces the network measurement intent, and give an
   example of network measurement of busy network performances.  On the
   basis of existing intent drafts, this memo can be used as a use case
   for IBN.

4.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no requests to IANA.
