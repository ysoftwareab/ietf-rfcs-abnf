           Constrained Join Proxy for Bootstrapping Protocols
            draft-vanderstok-anima-constrained-join-proxy-02

Abstract

   This document defines a protocol to securely assign a pledge to an
   owner, using an intermediary node between pledge and owner.  This
   intermediary node is known as a "constrained Join Proxy".

   This document extends the work of [ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]
   by replacing the Circuit-proxy by a stateless constrained Join Proxy,
   that transports routing information.

1.  Introduction

   Enrolment of new nodes into constrained networks with constrained
   nodes present is described in [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra]
   and makes use of Enrolment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030].
   The specified solutions use https and may be too large in terms of

   code space or bandwidth required.  Constrained devices in constrained
   networks [RFC7228] typically implement the IPv6 over Low-Power
   Wireless personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) [RFC4944] and Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252].

   CoAP has chosen Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC6347] as
   the preferred security protocol for authenticity and confidentiality
   of the messages.  A constrained version of EST, using Coap and DTLS,
   is described in [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est].

   DTLS is a client-server protocol relying on the underlying IP layer
   to perform the routing between the DTLS Client and the DTLS Server.
   However, the new "joining" device will not be IP routable until it is
   authenticated to the network.  A new "joining" device can only
   initially use a link-local IPv6 address to communicate with a
   neighbour node using neighbour discovery [RFC6775] until it receives
   the necessary network configuration parameters.  However, before the
   device can receive these configuration parameters, it needs to
   authenticate itself to the network to which it connects.  In
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] Enrolment over Secure
   Transport (EST) [RFC7030] is used to authenticate the joining device.
   However, IPv6 routing is necessary to establish a connection between
   joining device and the EST server.

   This document specifies a Join Proxy and protocol to act as
   intermediary between joining device and EST server to establish a
   connection between joining device and EST server.

   This document is very much inspired by text published earlier in
   [I-D.kumar-dice-dtls-relay].

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8366], and are used
   identically as in that document: artifact, imprint, domain, Join
   Registrar/Coordinator (JRC), Manufacturer Authorized Signing
   Authority (MASA), pledge, Trust of First Use (TOFU), and Voucher.

3.  Requirements Language

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
   implementations.

4.  Join Proxy functionality

   As depicted in the Figure 1, the joining Device, or pledge (P), is
   more than one hop away from the EST server (E) and not yet
   authenticated into the network.  At this stage, it can only
   communicate one-hop to its nearest neighbour, the Join Proxy (J)
   using their link-local IPv6 addresses.  However, the Pledge (P) needs
   to communicate with end-to-end security with a Registrar hosting the
   EST server (E) to authenticate and get the relevant system/network
   parameters.  If the Pledge (P) initiates a DTLS connection to the EST
   server whose IP address has been pre-configured, then the packets are
   dropped at the Join Proxy (J) since the Pledge (P) is not yet
   admitted to the network or there is no IP routability to Pledge (P)
   for any returned messages.

                      Figure 1: multi-hop enrolment.

   Furthermore, the Pledge (P) may wish to establish a secure connection
   to the EST server (E) in the network assuming appropriate credentials
   are exchanged out-of-band, e.g. a hash of the Pledge (P)'s raw public
   key could be provided to the EST server (E).  However, the Pledge (P)
   may be unaware of the IP address of the EST-server (E) to initiate a
   DTLS connection and perform authentication with.

   A DTLS connection is required between Pledge and EST server.  To
   overcome the problems with non-routability of DTLS packets and/ or
   discovery of the destination address of the EST Server to contact,
   the Join Proxy is introduced.  This Join Proxy functionality is
   configured into all authenticated devices in the network which may
   act as the Join Proxy for newly joining nodes.  The Join Proxy allows
   for routing of the packets from the Pledge using IP routing to the
   intended EST Server.

5.  Join Proxy specification

   The Join Proxy can operate in two modes:

   o  Statefull mode

Internet-Draft                 Join-Proxy                      July 2019


   o  Stateless mode

5.1.  Statefull Join Proxy

   In stateful mode, the joining node forwards the DTLS messages to the
   EST Server.

   Assume that the Pledge does not know the IP address of the EST Server
   it needs to contact.  In that situation, the Join Proxy knows the
   (cofigured or discovered) IP address of a EST Server that the Pledge
   needs to contact.  The Pledge initiates its request as if the Join
   Proxy is the intended EST Server.  The Join Proxy changes the IP
   packet (without modifying the DTLS message) as in the previous case
   by modifying both the source and destination addresses to forward the
   message to the intended EST Server.  The Join Proxy maintains a
   4-tuple array to translate the DTLS messages received from the EST
   Server and forward it to the EST Client.  In Figure 2 the various
   steps of the message flow are shown:

   +------------+------------+-------------+--------------------------+
   | EST Client | Join Proxy | EST Server  |          Message         |
   |    (P)     |     (J)    |    (E)      | Src_IP:port | Dst_IP:port|

5.2.  Stateless Join Proxy

   The Join Proxy is stateless to minimize the requirements on the
   constrained Join Proxy device.

   When a joining device as a client attempts a DTLS connection to the
   EST server, it uses its link-local IP address as its IP source
   address.  This message is transmitted one-hop to a neighbour node.
   Under normal circumstances, this message would be dropped at the
   neighbour node since the joining device is not yet IP routable or it
   is not yet authenticated to send messages through the network.
   However, if the neighbour device has the Join Proxy functionality
   enabled, it routes the DTLS message to a specific EST Server.
   Additional security mechanisms need to exist to prevent this routing
   functionality being used by rogue nodes to bypass any network
   authentication procedures.

   If an untrusted DTLS Client that can only use link-local addressing
   wants to contact a trusted end-point EST Server, it sends the DTLS
   message to the Join Proxy.  The Join Proxy extends this message into
   a new type of message called Join ProxY (JPY) message and sends it on
   to the EST server.  The JPY message payload consists of two parts:

   o  Header (H) field: consisting of the source link-local address and
      port of the Pledge (P), and

   o  Contents (C) field: containing the original DTLS message.

   On receiving the JPY message, the EST Server retrieves the two parts.
   The EST Server transiently stores the Header field information.  The
   EST server uses the Contents field to execute the EST server
   functionality.  However, when the EST Server replies, it also extends
   its DTLS message with the header field in a JPY message and sends it
   back to the Join Proxy.  The Header contains the original source
   link-local address and port of the DTLS Client from the transient
   state stored earlier (which can now be discarded) and the Contents
   field contains the DTLS message.

   On receiving the JPY message, the Join Proxy retrieves the two parts.
   It uses the Header field to route the DTLS message retrieved from the
   Contents field to the Pledge.

   The Figure 3 depicts the message flow diagram:

5.3.  Stateless Message structure

   The JPY message is constructed as a payload with media-type
   application/multipart-core specified in [I-D.ietf-core-multipart-ct].
   Header and Contents fields use different media formats:

   1.  header field: application/CBOR containing a CBOR array [RFC7049]
       with the pledge IPv6 Link Local address as a 16-byte binary
       value, the pledge's UDP port number, if different from 5684, as a
       CBOR integer, and the proxy's ifindex or other identifier for the
       physical port on which the pledge is connected.  Header is not
       DTLS encrypted.

   2.  Content field: Any of the media types specified in
       [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est] and [I-D.ietf-anima-constrained-voucher]
       dependent on the function that is requested:

   content, will look like:

         [ 60: [IP_p, p_P, ident]

   Examples are shown in Appendix A.

6.  Comparison of stateless and statefull modes

   The stateful and stateless mode of operation for the Join Proxy have
   their advantages and disadvantages.  This section should enable to
   make a choice between the two modes based on the available device
   resources and network bandwidth.

7.  Discovery

   It is assumed that Join Proxy seamlessly provides a coaps connection
   between Pledge and coaps EST-server.  An additional Registrar is
   needed to connect the Pledge to an http EST server, see section 8 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est].  In particular this section replaces section
   4.2 of [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra].

   Three discovery cases are discussed: coap discovery, 6tisch discovery
   and GRASP discovery.

7.1.  Join Proxy discovers EST server

7.1.1.  Coap discovery

   The discovery of the coaps EST server, using coap discovery, by the
   Join Proxy follows section 6 of [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est].

7.1.2.  Autonomous Network

   In the context of autonomous networks, the Join Proxy uses the DULL
   GRASP M_FLOOD mechanism to announce itself.  Section 4.1.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] discusses this in more
   detail.  The EST-server announces itself using ACP instance of GRASP
   using M_FLOOD messages.  Autonomous Network Join Proxies MUST support
   GRASP discovery of EST-server as decribed in section 4.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] .

7.1.3.  6tisch discovery

   The discovery of EST server by the pledge uses the enhanced beacons
   as discussed in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-enrollment-enhanced-beacon].

7.2.  Pledge discovers Join Proxy

   The pledge and Join Proxy are assumed to communicate via Link-Local
   addresses.

7.2.1.  Autonomous Network

   The pledge MUST listen for GRASP M_FLOOD [I-D.ietf-anima-grasp]
   announcements of the objective: "AN_Proxy".  See section
   Section 4.1.1 [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra] for the details
   of the objective.

7.2.2.  Coap discovery

   In the context of a coap network without Autonomous Network support,
   discovery follows the standard coap policy.  The Pledge can discover
   a Join Proxy by sending a link-local multicast message to ALL CoAP
   Nodes with address FF02::FD.  Multiple or no nodes may respond.  The
   handling of multiple responses and the absence of responses follow
   section 4 of [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra].

   The presence and location of (path to) the Join Proxy resource are
   discovered by sending a GET request to "/.well-known/core" including
   a resource type (rt) parameter with the value "brski-proxy"
   [RFC6690].  Upon success, the return payload will contain the root
   resource of the Join Proxy resources.  It is up to the implementation
   to choose its root resource; throughout this document the example
   root resource /jp is used.  The example below shows the discovery of
   the presence and location of Join Proxy resources.

     RES: 2.05 Content
     </jp>; rt="brski-proxy";ct=62

   Port numbers, not returned in the example, are assumed to be the
   default numbers 5683 and 5684 for coap and coaps respectively
   (sections 12.6 and 12.7 of [RFC7252].  Discoverable port numbers MAY
   be returned in the <href> of the payload (see section 5.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-coap-est]).

8.  Security Considerations

   It should be noted here that the contents of the CBOR map are not
   protected, but that the communication is between the Proxy and a
   known registrar (a connected UDP socket), and that messages from
   other origins are ignored.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document needs to create a registry for key indices in the CBOR
   map.  It should be given a name, and the amending formula should be
   IETF Specification.

9.1.  Resource Type registry

   This specification registers a new Resource Type (rt=) Link Target
   Attributes in the "Resource Type (rt=) Link Target Attribute Values"
   subregistry under the "Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE)
   Parameters" registry.

     rt="brski-proxy". This EST resource is used to query and return
     the supported EST resource of a Join Proxy placed between Pledge
     and EST server.
