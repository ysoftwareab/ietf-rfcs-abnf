               draft-ip-address-privacy-considerations-01

Abstract

   This document provides an overview of privacy considerations related
   to user IP addresses.  It includes an analysis of some current use
   cases for tracking of user IP addresses, mainly in the context of
   anti-abuse.  It discusses the privacy issues associated with such
   tracking and provides input on mechanisms to improve the privacy of
   this existing model.  It then captures requirements for proposed
   'replacement signals' for IP addresses from this analysis.  In
   addition, existing and under-development techniques are evaluated for
   fulfilling these requirements.

1.  Introduction

   The initial intention of this draft is to capture an overview of the
   problem space and research on proposed solutions concerning privacy
   considerations related to user IP addresses.  The draft is likely to
   evolve significantly over time and may well split into multiple
   drafts as content is added.

Internet-Draft      IP Address Privacy Considerations          July 2021


   Tracking of user IP addresses is common place on the Internet today,
   and is particularly widely used in the context of anti-abuse, e.g.
   anti-fraud, DDoS management child protection activities.  IP
   addresses are currently used as a source of "reputation" in
   conjunction with other signals to protect against malicious traffic,
   since they are a relatively stable identifier of the origin of a
   request.  Servers use these reputations in determining whether or not
   a given packet, connection, or flow corresponds to malicious traffic.

   However, identifying the activity of users based on IP addresses has
   clear privacy implications ([WEBTRACKING1], [WEBTRACKING2]), e.g.
   user fingerprinting and cross site identity linking.  Many
   technologies exist today to allow users to hide their IP address to
   avoid such tracking, e.g.  VPNs ([VPNCMP1], [VPNCMP2]) or Tor ([TOR],
   [VPNTOR]).  Several new technologies are also emerging in the
   landscape e.g.  Gnatcatcher [GNATCATCHER], Apple Private Relay
   [APPLEPRIV] and Oblivious technologies (OHTTP
   [I-D.thomson-http-oblivious], ODoH [I-D.pauly-dprive-oblivious-doh]).

   General consideration about privacy for Internet protocols can be
   found in [RFC6973].  This document is more specific and attempts to
   capture the following aspects of the tension between valid use cases
   for user identification and the related privacy concerns including:

   *  An analysis of the current use cases, attempting to categorize/
      group such use cases where commonalities exist

   *  Find ways to enhance the privacy of existing uses of IP addresses.

   *  Generating requirements for proposed 'replacement signals' from
      this analysis (these could be different for each category/group of
      use cases)

   *  Research to evaluate existing technologies or propose new
      mechanisms for such signals

2.  Terminology

   (Work in progress)

   *  Identity: Any identifying information about an end-user or
      service, be it a client or server, including IP addresses.

   *  Reputation: A random variable with some distribution.  A
      reputation can either be "bad" or "good" with some probability
      according to the distribution.

   *  Reputation context: The context in which a given reputation
      applies.

   *  Reputation proof: A non-interactive zero knowledge proof of a
      reputation signal.

   *  Reputation signal: A representative of a reputation.

3.  IP address tracking

3.1.  IP address use cases

3.1.1.  Anti-abuse

   Cyber-attackers abuse IP addresses posing a serious risk since
   legitimate service providers, developers, and end users may be
   mistakenly blacklisted which lowers the image and hurts the
   reputation of the service.

   Account abuse, financial fraud, ad fraud, child abuse...

3.1.2.  DDoS and Botnets

   Cyber-attackers can leverage on the good reputation of an IP address
   to carry out specific attacks that wouldn't work otherwise.  Main
   examples are Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks carried out
   spoofing a trusted (i.e., having good reputation) IP address (which
   may or may not be the victim of the attack) so that the servers used
   to generate the DDoS traffic actually respond to the attackers
   trigger (i.e., spoofed packets).  Similarly Botnets may use spoofed
   addresses in order to gain access and attack services that would not
   be otherwise reachable.

3.2.  Privacy implications of IP addresses

   IP addresses are sent in clear throughout the packet journey over the
   Internet.  As such, any observer along the path can pick it up and
   use it for various tracking purposes.  Beside basic information about
   the network or the device, it is possible to associate an IP address
   to an end user, hence, the relevance of of IP addresses for user
   privacy.  A very short list of information about user, device, and
   network that can be obtained via the IP address.

   *  Determine who owns and operates the network.  Searching the WHOIS
      database using an IP address can provide a range of information
      about the organization to which the address is assigned, including
      a name, phone number, and civic address;

Internet-Draft      IP Address Privacy Considerations          July 2021


   *  Through a reverse DNS lookup and/or traceroute the computer name
      can be obtained, which often contains clues to logical and
      physical location;

   *  Geo-localisation of the device (hence the user) through various
      techniques [GEOIP].  Depending on the lookup tool used, this could
      include country, region/state, city, latitude/longitude, telephone
      area code and a location-specific map;

   *  Search the Internet using the IP address or computer names.  The
      results of these searches might reveal peer-to-peer (P2P)
      activities (e.g., file sharing), records in web server log files,
      or glimpses of the individual's web activities (e.g., Wikipedia
      edits).  These bits of individuals' online history may reveal
      their political inclinations, state of health, sexuality,
      religious sentiments and a range of other personal
      characteristics, preoccupations and individual interests;

   *  Seek information on any e-mail addresses used from a particular IP
      address which, in turn, could be the subject of further requests
      for subscriber information.

3.3.  IP Privacy Protection and Law

   This section aim at providing some basic information about main
   example of laws adopted worldwide and related to IP address privacy
   (usually these laws area by product of the broader user privacy
   protection).

   Possible content (to focus only on technical IP address related
   aspects):

   *  GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) - EUROPE: Europe
      considers IP addresses as personal identification information that
      should be treated like any other personal information e.g. social
      security number.

   *  The United States has opted for a different approach to data
      protection.  Instead of formulating one all-encompassing
      regulation such as the EU's GDPR, the US chose to implement
      sector-specific privacy and data protection regulations that work
      together with state laws to safeguard American citizens' data.

   *  In 2020, China released the first draft of Personal Information
      Protection Law (PIPL).  The PIPL is the equivalent of European
      GDPR and will have significant influence.

   *  Japan Protection of Personal Information (APPI) Act (recent
      changes put the act close to the GDPR model).

3.4.  Mitigations for IP address tracking

   The ability to track individual people by IP address has been well
   understood for decades.  Commercial VPNs and Tor are the most common
   methods of mitigating IP address-based tracking.

   *  Commerical VPNs offer a layer of indirection between the user and
      the destination, however if the VPN endpoint's IP address is
      static then this simply substitutes one address for another.  In
      addition, commerial VPNs replace tracking across sites with a
      single company that may track their users' activities.

   *  Tor is another mitigation option due to its dynamic path selection
      and distributed network of relays, however its current design
      suffers from degraded performance.  In addition, correct
      application integration is difficult and not common.

   *  Address anonymization (e.g.  [GNATCATCHER] and similar): {

      -  {GNATCATCHER}} is a single-hop proxy system providing more
         protection against third-party tracking than a traditional
         commercial VPN.  However, its design maintains the industry-
         standard reliance on IP addresses for anti-abuse purposes and
         it provides near backwards compatibility for select services
         that submit to periodic audits.

      -  [APPLEPRIV] iCloud Private Relay is described as using two
         proxies between the client and server, and it would provide a
         level of protection somewhere between a commercial VPN and Tor.

   *  Recent interest has resulted in new protocols such as Oblivious
      DNS (ODoH (https://www.ietf.org/staging/draft-pauly-oblivious-doh-
      02.html)) and Oblivious HTTP (OHTTP
      (https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-thomson-http-oblivious-
      00.html)).  While they both prevent tracking by individual
      parties, they are not intended for the general-purpose web
      browsing use case.

   *  Finally, iCloud Private Relay is described as using two proxies
      between the client and server, and it would provide a level of
      protection somewhere between a commercial VPN and Tor.

   *  Temporary addresses

4.  Replacement signals for IP addresses

   Fundamentally, the current ecosystem operates by making the paths of
   a connection accountable for bad traffic, rather than the sources of
   the traffic itself.  This is problematic because paths are shared by
   multiple clients and are impermanent.  Ideally, clients could present
   proof of reputation that is separate from the IP address, and
   uniquely bound to a given connection.

   Reputation services ([RFC7070]) are critical components present at
   multiple layers across the Internet and they are responsible for
   predicting whether a client will be abusive.  However, these services
   are constrainted by available identifiers when making a decision.  As
   a result of this constraint, IP addresses tend to be an influential
   signal in the reputation assigned to an identity.  Identifying
   alternatives for this dependency on IP addresses is a goal of this
   document.

4.1.  Requirements

   In the following the requirements of reputation signals are listed.
   Note that by "client(s)" it is intended an end user device (e.g., a
   PC or a mobile phone), while by "server(s)" it is intended a device
   offering an Internet service, which belong to an organisation/company
   but is not a personal device.

   Some considerations about reputation services are documented already
   in [I-D.kucherawy-repute-consid] from the perspective of
   organizations being operationally reliant on a third-party service.
   However, these considerations are relevant for and extend to a
   service's impact on clients, as well.

   With the goal of replacing IP addresses as a fundemental signal in
   calculating a reputation, we describe two classes of requirements:
   properties of a replacement reputation signal, and properties of a
   reputation system.  Each class is further divided into requirements
   of the client and requirements of the service.

4.1.1.  Required properties of replacement reputation signal

4.1.1.1.  General Requirements

   The following requirements apply to reputation signals in general,
   independently from whether is the reputation of a client or a server.

   *  Reputation signals MUST NOT remain valid indefinitely.  New
      reputation signals periodically must be obtained periodically.

Internet-Draft      IP Address Privacy Considerations          July 2021


   *  Reputation MUST NOT be transferable.

   *  Reputation signals MUST be bound to a context, and MUST NOT be
      transferrable across contexts.

4.1.1.2.  Client requirements

   The following requirement are specific to clients.

   *  Clients MUST be able to request and present new reputation proofs
      on demand.

   *  A reputation signal MUST NOT be linkable to any identifying
      information for which the signal corresponds.

   *  Clients MUST be able to demonstrate good faith and improve
      reputation if needed.

   *  Clients MUST be able to dispute their reputation.

   *  Clients MUST be able to determine and verify the context in which
      a given reputation applies.

4.1.1.3.  Server requirements

   *  A reputation signal MUST NOT remain valid indefinitely meaning a
      client must obtain a new reputation signals periodically.

   *  A reputation signal MUST be bound to a reputation context, and
      MUST NOT be transferable across contexts.

4.1.2.  Requirements of a reputation system

4.1.2.1.  Client requirements

   TODO

4.1.2.2.  Server requirements

   TODO

4.2.  Evaluation of existing technologies

   Technologies exist that solve problems in similar problem spaces,
   however none fulfill the above criteria.

   PrivacyPass [I-D.ietf-privacypass-protocol] is not directly
   applicable for this use case, but it has been shown to be a useful
   building block for solving numerous problems.  Its design simply
   allows substituting a CAPTCHA challenge with a token.  The token
   can't carry additional information about the client's reputation, the
   token is not guaranteed to expire, and the tokens are not bound to an
   identity.  Furthermore, PrivacyPass does not itself specify a
   reputation system, therefore it cannot be used to derive an
   unlinkable reputation signal.

   Trust Tokens [TRUSTTOKEN] are an extension of PrivacyPass where the
   tokens are allowed to carry private metadata.  This additional
   metadata would allow for encoding information about a client's
   reputation, but Trust Tokens are not bound to an identity and they do
   not necessarily expire.
