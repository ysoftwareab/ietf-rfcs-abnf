     Federated Authentication Beyond The Web: Problem Statement and
                              Requirements

Abstract

   It is quite common that application developers and system architects
   are in need for authentication and authorization support in a
   distributed environment.  At least three parties need to cooperate,
   namely the end host, the identity provider, and the relying party.
   At the end of the exchange the identity provider asserts identity
   information or certain attributes to the relying party without
   exposing the user's long-term secret to the relying party.

   Although the problem sounds challenging and interesting, it is not
   new.  In fact, various IETF groups have produced specifications to
   solve this problem, such as Kerberos, RADIUS, and Diameter.  Outside
   the IETF various Single-Sign-On solution for HTTP-based applications
   have been developed as well.

   The reader might therefore wonder about the need for new work given
   the existence of readily available solutions.  This document tries to
   answer this question in a compact fashion.  Note that the description
   in this document focuses on the scope of the new work as part of the
   "Federated Authentication Beyond The Web" BOF being proposed rather
   than what could be theoretically done.

1.  Introduction

   The typical setup for a three party protocol involves the End-host,
   the identity-provider and relying party as illustrated in Figure 1.
   It might be of surprise that there are actually four parties shown in
   Figure 1; we will address the invisible party in the middle a little
   bit later.

   With three party protocols there are a number of different protocol
   variants possible, as the available crypto-literature shows.  We will
   not discuss the different options in this document.  What is relevant
   is that a real world entity is behind the end host and responsible
   for establishing some form of contract with the identity provider,
   even if it is only as weak as completing a web form and confirming
   the verification email.  The outcome of this initial registration
   step is that credentials are made available to the identity provider
   and to the end host (or the user).  It is important to highlight that
   in some scenarios there might indeed be a human behind the device
   denoted as end host and in other cases there is no human involved in
   the actual protocol execution.

   We assume that the identity provider and the relying party belong to
   different administrative domains.  Very often there is some form of
   relationship between the identity provider and the relying party.
   This is particularly important when the relying party wants to use
   information obtained from the identity provider for authorization
   decisions and when the identity provider does not want to release
   information to every relying party (or only under certain
   conditions).  While it is possible to have a bilateral agreement
   between every identity provider and every relying party; on an
   Internet scale this setup does require some intermediary, the "stuff-
   in-the-middle".  Please note that the lack of scalability is not
   caused by technical limitations but rather by business limitations
   since the agreements between identity providers and the relying
   parties are often business contracts that are financially motivated.
   The "stuff-in-the-middle" is a placeholder for technical
   interoperability as well as business practices and operational
   arrangements, many aspects are outside the scope of the IETF.

      Agreed terminology for what is labeled as generically "stuff-in-
      the-middle" is unfortunately not available.  Sometimes the term
      "identity federation", or "trust framework" are used.  To make it
      worse, different terminology is used when looking at specific
      protocols.

              Figure 1: Three Party Authentication Framework

   Designing new three party authentication and authorization protocols
   is hard and cryptographic flaws common in designs.  Achieving
   widespead deployment is even more difficult.  The HTTP-based Web has
   enjoyed a lot of attention from the industry with respect to this
   problem and some amount of success can be noticed even though many of
   the business aspects with the "stuff-in-the-middle" still has to be
   sorted out.  This document does not focus on an HTTP-based
   environment and instead focuses on those protocols where HTTP is not
   used.  Despite the increased excitement for layering every protocol
   on top of HTTP there are still a number of protocols available that
   do not use HTTP-based transports.  Many of these protocols are
   lacking an authentication and authorization framework of the style
   shown in Figure 1.

   Interestingly, for network access authentication the usage of the AAA
   framework with RADIUS [RFC2865] and Diameter [RFC3588] was quite
   successful from a deployment point of view.  To map the terminology
   used in Figure 1 to the AAA framework the identity provider

   corresponds to the AAA server, the relying party corresponds to the
   AAA client, and the "stuff-in-the-middle" are AAA proxies and relays
   (particularly if they are operated by third parties, such as AAA
   brokers and clearing houses).  The front-end, i.e. the end host to
   AAA client communication, is in case of network access authentication
   offered by link layer protocols that forward authentication protocol
   exchanges back-and-forth.

   Is it possible to design a system that builds on top of successful
   protocols to offer non-Web-based protocols with a solid starting
   point for authentication and authorization in a distributed system?

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Assumptions and Requirements

   Some requirements restrict the solution space more than others.  In
   this particular case the main requirement is to re-use an existing
   infrastructure, namely the AAA framework.  Briefly stated: The
   solution MUST make use of the AAA infrastructure (RADIUS and
   Diameter).  Ideally, modifications at AAA servers SHOULD be kept at a
   minimum.  Modifications to the AAA infrastructure that affect
   operational aspects MUST NOT be made.

   The next requirement concerns security: The relying party MUST NOT
   get in possession of the long-term secret of the entity that is
   authenticated towards the AAA server.  Since there is no single
   authentication mechanism that will be used everywhere there is
   another associated requirement: The authentication framework MUST
   allow for the flexible integration of authentication mechanisms.

      Those who are familiar with the AAA framework might realize that
      the choices are limited.  The standardized Extensible
      Authentication Protocol (EAP) framework [RFC3748] fits the above
      requirements and is widely deployed.

   Assuming that this design decision is taken for granted the remaining
   work is with the integration of the AAA infrastructure into non-Web-
   based application protocols.  Figure 2 illustrates it graphically.

                      Figure 2: Front-End Integration

   The front-end (end host to relying party) communication MUST be
   integrated into the authentication framework available to the back-
   end.  As argued previously the end-to-end authentication framework is
   EAP.  Although EAP support is already integrated in AAA systems (see
   [RFC3579] and [RFC4072]) the challenge remains to carry EAP payloads
   from the end host to the relying party using some mechanism.

      For illustrative purposes, some examples of the front-end
      protocols suitable for carrying EAP are "TLS using EAP
      Authentication" [I-D.nir-tls-eap], and GSS-API Mechanism for the
      EAP [I-D.howlett-eap-gss].

   The changes to the end host and the changes to the relying party
   SHOULD be kept at a minimum.  A mechanism that can demonstrate
   deployment benefits (based on ease of update of existing software,
   low implementation effort, etc.)  MUST be preferred.  There MAY be a
   need to specify multiple mechanisms to support the range of different
   deployment scenarios.
