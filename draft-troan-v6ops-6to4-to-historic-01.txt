Abstract

   Experience with the "Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds
   (6to4)" IPv6 transitioning mechanism has shown that the mechanism is
   unsuitable for widespread deployment and use in the Internet.  This
   document requests that RFC3056 and the companion document "An Anycast
   Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers" RFC3068 are moved to historic status.

1.  Introduction

   The IPv6 transitioning mechanism "Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4
   Clouds (6to4) described in [RFC3056] and the extension in "An Anycast
   Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers" RFC3068 [RFC3068] have been shown to
   have severe practical problems being used in the Internet.  This
   document requests that RFC3056 and RFC3068 be moved to Historic
   status as defined in section 4.2.4 [RFC2026].

   See also the document Non-Managed IPv6 Tunnels considered Harmful
   [I-D.vandevelde-v6ops-harmful-tunnels] for details.

   [I-D.kuarsingh-v6ops-6to4-provider-managed-tunnel] are proposing a
   mechanism using IPv6 NAT to solve the 6to4 reverse path problem.

   [I-D.carpenter-v6ops-6to4-teredo-advisory] are proposing a set of
   suggestions to improve 6to4 reliability.

   Declaring the mechanism historic is not expected to have immediate
   product implications.  The IETF sees no evolutionary future for the
   mechanism and it is not recommended to include this mechanism in new
   implementations.


2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  6to4 operational problems

   6to4 is a mechanism designed to allow isolated IPv6 islands to reach
   each other using IPv6 over IPv4 automatic tunneling.  To reach the
   native IPv6 Internet the mechanism uses relay routers both in the
   forward and reverse direction.  The mechanism is supported in many
   IPv6 implementations.  With the increased deployment of IPv6, the
   mechanism has been shown to have a number of fundamental
   shortcomings.

   6to4 depends on relays both in the forward and reverse direction to
   enable connectivity with the native IPv6 Internet.  A 6to4 node will
   send IPv4 encapsulated IPv6 traffic to a 6to4 relay, that is

   connected both to the 6to4 cloud and to native IPv6.  In the reverse
   direction a 2002::/16 route is injected into the native IPv6 routing
   domain to attract traffic from native IPv6 nodes to a 6to4 relay
   router.  It is expected that traffic will use different relays in the
   forward and reverse direction.  RFC3068 adds an extension that allows
   the use of a well known IPv4 anycast address to reach the nearest
   6to4 relay in the forward direction.

   One model of 6to4 deployment as described in section 5.2, RFC3056,
   suggests that a 6to4 router should have a set of managed connections
   (read BGP peers) to a set of 6to4 relay routers.  While this makes
   the forward path more controlled, it does not help the reverse path.
   In any case this model has the same operational burden has manually
   configured tunnels and has seen no deployment in the public Internet.

   6to4 issues:
   o  Use of relays. 6to4 depends on the charity of an unknown third-
      party to operate the relays between the 6to4 cloud and the native
      IPv6 Internet.  With the use of mechanism specified in [RFC3068]
      in both directions, without it only in the reverse direction (from
      native to 6to4) [RFC3056].
   o  The placement of the relay can lead to increased latency, and in
      the case the relay is overloaded packet loss.
   o  There is generally no customer relationship or even a way for the
      end-user to know who the relay operator is, so no support is
      possible.
   o  In case of the reverse path 6to4 relay and the anycast forward
      6to4 relay, these have to be open for any address.  Only limited
      by the scope of the routing advertisement. 6to4 relays can be used
      to anonymize traffic and inject attacks into IPv6 that are very
      difficult to trace.
   o  6to4 has no specified mechanism to handle the case where the
      protocol (41) is blocked in intermediate firewalls.  It can not be
      expected that path MTU discovery across the Internet works
      reliably; ICMP messages may be blocked and in any case an IPv4
      ICMP message rarely has enough of the original packet in it to be
      useful to proxy back to the IPv6 sender.
   o  As 6to4 tunnels across the Internet, the IPv4 addresses used must
      be globally reachable.  RFC3056 states that a private address
      [RFC1918] MUST NOT be used. 6to4 will not work in networks that
      employ addresses with limited topological span.

5.  Recommendations for implementors

   If the implementation continues to support 6to4, then the 6to4
   functionality MUST NOT be enabled by default.

   If the implementation continues to support 6to4, then the Source
   Address Selection algorithm [RFC3484] MUST use a 6to4 address as a
   last resort.  I.e. only use it the node has no other means of IPv6
   connectivity and the destination is IPv6 only.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification does not require any IANA actions.


7.  Security Considerations

   There are no new security considerations pertaining to this document.
   General security issues with tunnels are listed in
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-tunnel-security-concerns] and more specifically to
   6to4 in [I-D.ietf-v6ops-tunnel-loops] and
   [I-D.vandevelde-v6ops-harmful-tunnels].
