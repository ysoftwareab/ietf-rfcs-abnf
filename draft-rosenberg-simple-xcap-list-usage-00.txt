Abstract

   This document describes a usage of the Extensible Markup Language
   (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) for manipulating lists of
   presentities (also known as buddy lists or rosters). It does so by
   specifying an XML Schema that contains a list of presentities that a
   user is interested in watching.

1. Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Instant Messaging and
   Presence (SIMPLE) specifications allow a user, called a watcher, to
   subscribe to another user, called a presentity [7], in order to learn
   their presence information [8]. In many cases, a watcher will be
   interested in not just a single presentity, but a list of
   presentities. Such a list of presentities is called a presence list.

   When a user wants to subscribe to their presence list, the procedures
   in [8] require the watcher to create and manage a subscription for
   each presentity in their list. For large lists, the bandwidth
   required to do this can be a problem, particularly for wireless
   networks.  An extension to the SIP events framework [9] has been
   defined. The extension allows a watcher to subscribe to a list of
   resources, using a single subscription [10]. This mechanism assumes
   that a server, called the Resource List Server (RLS) has a copy of
   the presence list that the user wishes to subscribe to. By using
   protocols such as the XML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) [12],
   a client can place this list on the server, and manipulate it as
   needed.

   XCAP requires application usages to standardize several pieces of
   information, including an application unique ID (AUID), an XML
   schema, and various other pieces of information. This specification
   fulfills those requirements.

   The XML schema defined here has several other usages outside of XCAP:

   1.  A PC client application will need to know the users in the
       presence list, so that it can generate a subscription to each
       one. This information represents user provisioned data for the
       application. Typically, this information is stored on local disk
       in a proprietary file format. By defining a standard format, the
       same list can be used by a multiplicity of different client
       applications, providing portability across them.

   2.  It is common for users to share presence lists. As an example,
       user A may have three people in their list that they wish to tell
       user B about. User A would like to send an email to user B with
       an attachment describing these three people. Should user B open
       the attachment, the three people can be added to their own
       presence list. Doing this requires a standardized format for
       exchanging lists over email, instant messaging, and other
       communications protocols.

2. Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3. Application Unique ID

   XCAP requires application usages to define a unique application usage
   ID (AUID) in either the IETF tree or a vendor tree. This
   specification defines the "presence-lists" AUID within the IETF tree,
   via the IANA registration in Section 12.

4. Structure of a Presence List

   A presence list is an XML [2] document that MUST be well-formed and
   SHOULD be valid. Presence list documents MUST be based on XML 1.0 and
   MUST be encoded using UTF-8. This specification makes use of XML
   namespaces for identifying presence list documents and document
   fragments. The namespace URI for elements defined by this
   specification is a URN [3], using the namespace identifier 'ietf'
   defined by [5] and extended by [6]. This URN is:

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:presence-lists

   A presence list document begins with the root element tag
   ``presence-lists''.  It consists of any number of ``list''
   sub-elements, each of which is a presence list. Other elements from
   different namespaces MAY be present for the purposes of
   extensibility; elements or attributes from unknown namespaces MUST be
   ignored. There are three attributes associated with this element. The
   first two, "name", and "subscribable" MUST be present:

      name: This attribute is a descriptive name for the list. It MUST
      be unique amongst all other list elements within the same parent
      element.

      subscribable: This boolean attribute indicates whether or not the
      list is subscribable or not.

   The other attribute, "uri" MAY be present:

      uri: This attribute provides a URI that can be used to subscribe
      to the list, using the SIP event notification extension for lists
      [10]. As a result, the URI MUST be either a SIP URI or a pres URI
      [11]. [[OPEN ISSUE: Do we want this to be a comma separated list,
      so that a presence list can have any number of valid aliases?]]

   [[OPEN ISSUE: We also need to define policy about who is allowed to
   subscribe to the list. We can either integrate that into the list
   definition described here, or handle that as a separate policy
   specification. The SEACAP proposal kept them together. I believe now
   that they should be kept separate.]]

   Each list element is composed of a sequence of entry elements or list
   elements. The ability of a list element to contain other list
   elements means that a presence list can be hierarchically structured.
   An entry element describes a single presentity that is part of the
   list. A list element can also contain elements from other namespaces,
   for the purposes of extensibility.

   The entry element describes a single presentity. The entry element
   has two attributes:

      name: This mandatory attribute is a unique identifier amongst all
      other entry elements of the same parent.

      uri: This optional attribute is a URI that is used to subscribe to
      the presentity. It MUST be either a SIP or pres URI.

   The entry element contains a sequence of other elements. Only one
   such element is defined at this time, which is the display-name. This
   element provides a UTF-8 encoded string, meant for consumption by the
   user, that describes the presentity. Unlike the "name" attribute of
   the entry element, the display-name has no uniqueness requirements.
   [[OPEN ISSUE: Do we need this in addition to the name attribute?]].
   Other elements from other namespaces MAY be included. This is meant
   to support the inclusion of other information about the entry, such
   as a phone number or postal address.

5. Computed Data

   An XCAP server supporting this application usage need only worry
   about a single piece of computed data - the "uri" attribute of the
   list element.

   If the "uri" attribute is absent in a document written to an XCAP
   server, but the "subscribable" flag is true, the XCAP server MUST
   allocate a URI for this list. This allocated URI MUST be globally
   unique, and MUST route to an RLS which will handle list subscriptions
   for the list defined by the document. The server MUST set the uri
   attribute of the document with this URI.

   A server MUST NOT delete the "uri" attribute, however, should a
   client change the subscribable flag to false after the server has
   allocated a URI.

6. Additional Constraints

   There are no constraints on the document beyond those described in
   the schema.

7. Naming Conventions

   There are no naming conventions that need to be defined for this
   application usage. A subscription to a presence list will be to a
   specific URI. That URI will be one of the "uri" attributes defined in
   a list within one of the documents managed by an XCAP server.

8. Authorization Policies

   This application usage does not modify the default XCAP authorization
   policy, which is that only a user can read, write or modify their own
   documents. A server can allow priveleged users to modify documents
   that they don't own, but the establishment and indication of such
   policies is outside the scope of this document.

10. Example Document

   The following is an example of a document compliant to the schema:


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <presence-lists xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
     <list name="friends" uri="sip:friends@example.com" subscribable="true">
       <entry name="Bill" uri="sip:bill@example.com">
         <display-name>Bill Doe</display-name>
       </entry>
       <list name="close-friends" uri="sip:close-friends@example.com"
             subscribable="true">
         <entry name="Joe" uri="sip:joe@example.com">
           <display-name>Joe Smith</display-name>
         </entry>
         <entry name="Nancy" uri="sip:nancy@example.com">
           <display-name>Nancy Gross</display-name>
         </entry>
       </list>
     </list>
   </presence-lists>

11. Security Considerations

   The configuration information defined by this application usage is
   particularly sensitive. It represents the principle set of people
   with whom a user would like to communicate. As a result, clients
   SHOULD use TLS when contacting servers in order to fetch this
   information. Note that this does not represent a change in
   requirement strength from XCAP.
