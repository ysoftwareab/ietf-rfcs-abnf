Internet-Draft    SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting    February 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a new SIP event package, vq-rtcpxr, and a new
   MIME type, application/vq-rtcpxr, that enable the collection and
   reporting of metrics that measure quality for RTP [3] sessions.  The
   definitions of the metrics used in the event package are based on
   RTCP Extended Reports [4] and RTCP [3].  Monitoring of voice quality
   is believed to be the highest priority for usage of this mechanism
   and as such, the metrics in the event package are largely tailored
   for voice quality measurement.  However, the event package defined
   herein is designed to be extensible.  The event package explicitly
   provides parameters for reporting both the local and remote versions
   of these statistics.  Note that in multi-party calls, multiple
   reports will need to be generated either one for each endpoint or one
   for each session.  Configuration of usage of the event package is not
   covered in this document.  The event package can be used either with
   the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY methods or the PUBLISH method.  Message flow
   examples for both mechanims are provided in this document.


2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.


3.  SIP Events Approach

   This document defines a new SIP events package [5].  The intended
   methods to use for this event are PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY.  A
   SIP UA can provide voice quality reports using either of these
   methods to an entity which can make the information available to
   other applications.


4.  Use of PUBLISH Method

   A SIP UA that supports this specification may send the service
   quality metric reports using the PUBLISH method.  An application
   wishing to access this performance data maintains a State Agent for
   the vq-rtcpxr event package.  The Request-URI of the PUBLISH method
   is set to the address of the resource for the VoIP application.  The
   PUBLISH message is sent to the normal default outbound proxy server
   of the SIP UA or could be sent to other interested parties.

Internet-Draft    SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting    February 2006


   The use of PUBLISH by this event is unique in that it does not
   require a soft or hard state to be maintained by either the Event
   Publication Agent (EPA) or the Event State Compositor (ESC).
   Futhermore the information that is presented by the vq-rtcpxr event
   in a PUBLISH request is not expected to have an expiration, rather,
   the information is associated with the timestamps in the event
   itself.  The primary intention of using PUBLISH for this event is
   reduction of transaction processing.

   A concern over the usage of the PUBLISH method is potential
   overloading of servers receiving the events, particularly in the
   threshold reporting model.  There are many approaches to solving this
   type of problem, but clearly the EPA's needs to adhere to some
   guidelines to reduce the probability of causing this overload
   condition.  Some suggested solutions are: a) limit sending of one
   threshold report per metric per session b) limit sending of one
   threshold report per session regardless of the metric c) limit
   sending a new threshold report to when a metric state has been
   sustained for a reasonable amount of time such as 20-30 seconds.


5.  Event Package Formal Definition

5.1.  Event Package Name

   This document defines a SIP Event Package as defined in RFC 3265 [2].
   The event-package token name for this package is:

   "vq-rtcpxr"

5.2.  Event Package Parameters

   No event package parameters are defined.

5.3.  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   No SUBSCRIBE bodies are described by this specification.

5.4.  Subscription Duration

   Subscriptions to this event package MAY range from minutes to weeks.
   Subscriptions in hours or days are more typical and are RECOMMENDED.
   The default subscription duration for this event package is one hour.

5.5.  NOTIFY Bodies

   There are three notify bodies: a session report, an interval session
   report, and a alert report.

Internet-Draft    SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting    February 2006


   The session report is used for end of session reporting.  This can be
   generated when a voice media session terminates or when a media
   change occurs, such as a codec change or a session forks.  This
   report is intended to allow cumulative metric reporting.  The session
   reports will populate the metrics with values that are measured over
   the interval explicitly defined by the "start" and "stop" timestamps.

   The interval report is used for periodic or interval reporting.  This
   report is intended to capture short duration metric reporting.
   Interval reports will populate the metrics with values that are
   measured over the interval explicitly defined by the "start" and
   "stop" timestamps.

   The threshold report is used when voice quality degrades during a
   session.  The session report parameters are also included in the
   alert report to provide all of the necessary diagnostic information.
   Like the interval report, the metrics in the threshold reports will
   be populated with values that are measured over the interval
   explicitly defined by the "start" and "stop" timestamps.

   This specification defines a new MIME type application/vq-rtcpxr
   which is a text encoding of the RTCP and RTCP-XR statistics, along
   with some additional metrics and correlation information.

5.6.  Voice Quality Event Syntax and Semantics

   This section describes the syntax extensions required for event
   publication in SIP.  The formal syntax definitions described in this
   section are expressed in the Augmented BNF [6] format used in SIP [2],
   and contains references to elements defined therein.  Additionally,
   the definition of the timestamp format is provided in [7].  Note that
   most of the parameters are optional.  In practice, most
   implementations will send a subset of the parameters.  It is not the
   intention of this document to define what parameters may or may not
   be useful for monitoring the quality of a voice session, but to
   enable reporting of voice quality.  As such, the syntax allows the
   implementer to choose which metrics are most appropriate for their
   solution.  As there are no "invalid", "unknown", or "not applicable"
   values in the syntax, the intention is to exclude any parameters for
   which values are not available, not applicable, or unknown.
   Additionally, the authors recognize that implementers may need to add
   new parameter lines to the reports and new metrics to the existing
   parameter lines.  The extension tokens are intended to fulfill this
   need.

   This alert indicates that the quality of the call in progress,
   as measured by the Listening Quality R metric, has degraded to an
   unacceptable level.  For futher troubleshooting of the problem, all
   metrics are populated, including the remote values obtained
   via RTCP XR (RFC 3611) in the endpoints.

      Applications which use this media type: This document type is
           being used in notifications of VoIP quality reports.

      Additional Information:

           Magic Number: None

           File Extension: None

           Macintosh file type code: "TEXT"

      Intended usage: COMMON

      Author/Change controller: The IETF.

5.9.  Security Considerations

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide
   information about the nature and duration of a session established
   between two or more endpoints.  As a result, any third party wishing
   to obtain this information SHOULD be properly authenticated by the
   SIP UA using standard SIP mechanisms and according to the
   recommendations in [5].  Additionally the event content MAY be
   encrypted to ensure confidentiality; the mechanisms for providing
   confidentiality are detailed in [2].
