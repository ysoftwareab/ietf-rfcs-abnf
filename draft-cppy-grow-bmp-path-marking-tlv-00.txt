                   BMP Extension for Path Marking TLV
                draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-marking-tlv-00

Abstract

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides the monitoring of BGP adj-
   rib-in [RFC7854], BGP local-rib [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-local-rib] and BGP
   adj-rib-out [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-adj-rib-out] through Route Monitoring
   (RM) messages.  With the capability of allowing optional data to be
   added to the RM Messages in the format of TLV draft-lucente-bmp-tlv
   [I-D.lucente-bmp-tlv], more information about the BGP Update message
   encapsulated in the RM can be revealed.  This document proposes an
   extension to BMP to describe the BGP path status through the
   definition and use of Path Marking TLV.

1.  Introduction

   For a given prefix, multiple paths with different path status, e.g.,
   the "best-path", the "best-external-path" and so on, may co-exist in
   the BGP module upon the local policy processing.  In addition, during
   the whole process, from receiving a BGP route to advertising it, a
   path can also undergo various status in different processing states.
   Such path status information is currently not carried in the BGP
   Update Message RFC4271 [RFC4271].  However, they can be useful to
   enable a lot of applications.  For example, for traffic steering
   purposes in a SDN enviroment, the operator/SDN controller needs the
   reachability information of multiple paths to ensure the selected
   optimized route is reachable.

   This document defines a so-called Path Marking TLV to convey the BGP
   path status information to the BMP server.  The BMP Path Marking is
   defined to be prepended in the BMP Route Monitoring (RM) Message.

2.  Path Marking TLV for the RM Message

   Per RFC4271 [RFC4271], the BMP RM Message consists of the Common
   Header, Per-Peer Header, and the BGP Update PDU.  According to draft-
   lucente-bmp-tlv [I-D.lucente-bmp-tlv], optional trailing data in TLV
   format is allowed in the BMP RM Message to convey characteristics of
   transported NLRIs (ie. to help stateless parsing) or vendor-specific
   data.  Such TLV types are to be defined per each application.

   To include the path status along with each BGP path, we define the
   Path Marking TLV, shown as follows.

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |                       Path Type(4 octets)                     |

     |                     Reason String(Variable)                   |
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                       Figure 1: Path Marking TLV

   o  Type = TDB1 (2 Octets): Path Marking.

   o  Length (2 Octets): indicates the length of the value field of the
      Path Marking TLV.  The value field further consists of the Path-
      Type field and Reason String field.

   o  Path-Type (4 Octets): indicates the path status of the BGP Update
      PDU encapsulated in the RM Message.  Currently 8 types of path
      status are defined, as shown in Table 1.

   o  Reason String (Variable): indicates the reasons/explanations of
      the path status indicated in the Path Type field.  The detailed
      Reason String format is defined in Figure 2.

                     | 0x0002 | Best external path   |
                     | 0x0004 | Primary path         |
                     | 0x0008 | Backup path          |
                     | 0x0010 | Non-installed path   |
                     | 0x0020 | Unreachable next-hop |
                     +--------+----------------------+

                          Table 1: Path Type

   The Path type field contains a bitfield where each bit encodes a
   specific role of the path.  Multiple bits may be set when a path is
   used in multiple roles.

   The best-path is defined in RFC4271 [RFC4271] and the best-external
   path is defined in draft-ietf-idr-best-external
   [I-D.ietf-idr-best-external].

   A primary path is a recursive or non-recursive path that can be used
   all the time as long as a walk starting from this path can end to an
   adjacency draft-ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic].  A
   prefix can have more than one primary path.  A best-path is also
   considered as a primary path.

   A backup path is also installed in the RIB, but it is not used until
   some or all primary paths become unreachable.  Backup paths are used
   for fast convergence in the event of failures.

   All other reachable paths are marked as 'Non-installed'.

   Lastly, all paths that are considered unreachable are marked as
   'Unreachable next-hop'.  Unreachable paths may be sent only in
   special cases.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA assign the following new parameters
   to the BMP parameters name space.

4.1.  Path Marking TLV

   This document defines the Path Marking TLV with Type = TDB1: Path
   Marking (Section 2).

4.2.  Path Marking TLV Reason String

   This document defines three new sub types of the Reason String in the
   Path Marking TLV (Section 2.2).

   Sub Type 1 = TDB2: Non-Best Reason String.

   Sub Type 2 = TDB3: Uninstalled Reason String.

   Sub Type 3 = TDB4: Unreachable Reason String.

5.  Security Considerations

   It is not believed that this document adds any additional security
   considerations.
