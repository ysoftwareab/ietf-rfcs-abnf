       TLV Naming in the MANET Generalized Packet/Message Format
                   draft-dearlove-manet-tlv-naming-00

Abstract

   TLVs (type-length-value structures) as defined by RFC5444 have both a
   type (one octet) and a type extension (one octet), together forming a
   full type (of two octets).  RFC5444 sets up IANA registries for TLV
   types, specifying that an allocation of a TLV type entails creation
   of an IANA registry for the corresponding type extensions.

   In some cases, reserving all 256 type extensions for use for a common
   purpose for a given TLV is meaningful, and thus it makes sense to
   record a common name for such a TLV type (and all of its type
   extensions) in the corresponding IANA registries.  An example of such
   is a LINK_METRIC TLV Type, with its type extensions reserved for use
   to be indicating the "kind" of metric expressed by the value of the
   TLV.

   In some other cases, there may not be 256 full types that share a
   common purpose and, as such, it is not meaningful to record a common
   name for all the type extensions for a TLV type in the corresponding
   IANA registries.  Rather, it is appropriate to record an individual
   name per full type.

   This document reorganizes the naming of already allocated TLV types
   and type extensions in those registries to use names appropriately.
   It has no consequences in terms of any protocol implementation.

   This document also updates the Expert Review guidelines from RFC5444,
   so as to establish a policy for consistent naming of future TLV type
   and type extension allocations.

Internet-Draft                 TLV Naming                  November 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document reorganizes and rationalizes the naming of TLVs (type-
   length-value structures), defined by [RFC5444] and recorded by IANA
   in the Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) Parameters registries "Packet
   TLV Types", "Message TLV Types", and "Address Block TLV Types".

   This document reorganizes the naming of already allocated Packet,
   Message and Address Block TLV types, and their corresponding Type
   Extensions, and updates corresponding IANA registries.

   TLVs have a type (one octet) and a type extension (one octet) which
   together form a full type (of two octets).  A TLV may omit the type
   extension when it is zero, but that applies only to its
   representation, it still has a type extension of zero.  A TLV type
   defines an IANA registry of type extensions for that type.

   There have been two forms of TLV allocation.

   The first, but less common, form of allocation has been that
   allocation of the type has immediately defined (but not necessarily
   allocated) all the corresponding type extensions for versions of that
   type.  This applies, for example, to the Address Block TLV
   LINK_METRIC specified in [RFC7181].  The LINK_METRIC type extensions
   are all available for allocation for different definitions of link
   metric.  It is appropriate in this case to apply the name LINK_METRIC
   to the type, and also to all the full types corresponding to that
   type, as has been done.  Type extensions can then be individually
   named, or can be simply referred to by their number.

   The second, more common, form of allocation has been that for a TLV
   type, only type extension 0, and possibly the type extension 1, are
   defined.  An example is the Address Block TLV LINK_STATUS defined in
   [RFC6130], where only type extension 0 is allocated.  It is not
   reasonable to assume that the remaining 255 type extensions will be
   allocated to forms of LINK_STATUS.  (Other forms of link status are
   already catered to by the introduction, in [RFC7188], of a registry
   for values of the LINK_STATUS TLV.)  Thus the name LINK_STATUS should
   be attached to that specific type extension for that type, i.e., to
   the full type, and not to the TLV type when used with all other type
   extensions therefore.  This was, however, not done as part of the
   initial registration of this TLV type.  Effectively, this leaves, for
   the LINK_STAUS TLV type, the type extensions 1-255 either unavailable
   for allocation (if applying strictly the interpretation that they
   must relate to a LINK_STATUS), or counterintuitively named for their
   intended function.

Internet-Draft                 TLV Naming                  November 2014


   The purpose of this document is to change how these names are
   applied, and recorded in IANA registries, and to provide guidelines
   and instructions for future TLV type allocations.  This is to
   facilitate the addition of new TLVs using type extensions other than
   0, but without them having inappropriate names attached.  So, for
   example, LINK_STATUS will become the name of the full type (as
   composed by the TLV type 3 and the TLV type extension 0), and will
   cease being the name of the TLV type 3.  This leaves the question of
   how to name the type.  As it is not clear what other TLVs might be
   defined for other type extensions of the same type, it is proposed to
   leave the type currently unnamed, specified only by number.

   This document also updates the Expert Review guidelines from
   [RFC5444], so as to establish a policy for consisteng naming of
   future TLV type and type extension allocations.

   For clarity, all currently allocated TLVs in [RFC5497], [RFC6130],
   [RFC7181] and [RFC7182] will be listed in the IANA considerations
   section of this document, indicating no change when that is
   appropriate (such as the LINK_METRIC TLV).  The only changes are of
   naming.

   Note that nothing in this draft changes the operation of any
   protocol.  This naming is already used, in effect, in [RFC6130] and
   [RFC7181], currently the main users of allocated TLVs.  For example
   the former indicates that all usage of LINK_STATUS refers to that TLV
   with type extension 0.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   All references to elements such as packet, message and TLV in this
   document refer to those defined in [RFC5444].

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the Expert Review evaluation guidelines for
   Packet TLV Type, Message TLV Type, and Address Block TLV Type
   allocations, from [RFC5444], and updates the registries for already
   made allocations to follow these guidelines.

3.1.  Expert Review: Evaluation Guidelines

   For registration from the registries for Packet TLV Types, Message
   TLV Types, and Address Block TLV Types, the following guidelines
   apply, in addition to those given in section 6.1 in [RFC5444]:

   o  If the reguested TLV Type immediately defines (but not necessarily
      allocates) all the corresponding type extensions for versions of
      that type, then a common name SHOULD be assigned for the TLV type.

   o  Otherwise, if the reguested TLV Type does not immediately define
      all the corresponding type extensions for versions of that type,
      then a common name SHOULD NOT be assigned for that TLV type.
      Instead, it is RECOMMENDED that:

      *  The "description" for the allocated TLV type be "Defined by
         Type Extension";

      *  For Packet TLV Types, that the Type Extension registry, created
         for the TLV Type, be named "Type XX Packet TLV Type
         Extensions", with XX replaced by the numerical value of the TLV
         Type.

      *  For Message TLV Types, that the Type Extension registry,
         created for the TLV Type, be named "Type XX Message TLV Type
         Extensions", with XX replaced by the numerical value of the TLV
         Type.

      *  For Address Block TLV Types, that the Type Extension registry,
         created for the TLV Type, be named "Type XX Address Block TLV
         Type Extensions", with XX replaced by the numerical value of
         the TLV Type.

      *  That each Type Extension be given a name when allocated.

4.  Security Considerations

   As this document is concerned only with how entities are named, those
   names being used only in documents such as this and IANA registries,
   this document has no security considerations.


5.  Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank Adrian Farrel for having pointed out
   the need for reorganization and rationalization the naming of TLVs
   (type-length-value structures), defined by [RFC5444].
