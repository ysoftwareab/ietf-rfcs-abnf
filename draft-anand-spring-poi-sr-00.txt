             Packet-Optical Integration in Segment Routing 
                      draft-anand-spring-poi-sr-00


Abstract

   This document illustrates a way to integrate a new class of nodes and
   links in segment routing to represent networks in an opaque way for
   further extensibility of the link-state protocols that help with
   segment routing.  An instance of the opaque definition would be
   optical networks that are typically transport centric.  In the IP
   centric network, this will help in defining a common control protocol
   for packet optical integration that will include optical paths as
   opaque 'segments' or sub-paths as an augmentation to the defined
   extensions of segment routing. This opaque option defines a general
   mechanism to allow for future extensibility of segment routing.

1  Introduction

   Packet and optical transport networks have evolved independently with
   different control plane mechanisms that have to be provisioned and
   maintained separately. Consequently, coordinating packet and optical
   networks for delivering services such as end-to-end traffic  
   engineering or failure response has proved challenging. To address   
   this challenge, a unified control and management paradigm that 
   provides an incremental path to complete packet-optical integration  
   while leveraging existing signaling and routing protocols in either  
   domains is needed. This document introduces such a paradigm based on
   Segment Routing (SR) [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing]. 

   This document introduces a new type of segment, Opaque Adjacency
   Segment. Opaque Adjacency Segment can be used to model abstracted
   paths through the optical transport domain and integrate it with the
   packet network for delivering end-to-end services. In addition, this
   also introduces a notion of a Packet optical gateway (POG). These are
   nodes in the network that map packet services to the optical domain
   that originate and terminate these opaque adjacency segments. Given
   an opaque adjacency, a POG will expand it to a path in the optical
   transport network.



2.  Reference Taxonomy

   POG - Packet optical gateway Device

   SR Edge Router - The Edge Router which is the first SR capable device

   CE - Customer Edge Device that is outside of the SR domain

   PCE - Path Computation Engine

   Controller - A network controller 



3. Use case - Packet Optical Integration

   Many operators build and operate their networks that are both multi-
   layer and multi-domain. Services are built around these layers and
   domains to provide end-to-end services.  Due to the nature of the
   different domains, such as packet and optical,  the management and
   service creation has always been problematic and time consuming. With
   segment routing, enabling a head-end node to select a path and embed
   the information in the packet is a powerful construct that would be

   used in the Packet Optical Gateways (POG). The path is usually
   constructed for each domain that may be manually derived or through a
   stateful PCE which is run specifically in that domain.  

   P1---------O1---------P2---------O2---------P3---------O3---------P4

         Figure 1:  Representation of a packet-optical path

   In Figure 1 above, the nodes represent a packet optical network.  P1,
   P2, P3 and P4 are packet optical devices that are connected via
   optical paths O1, O2 and O3. Nodes P1 and P4 are edge devices that
   have customer facing devices (denoted as Border POGs) and P2 and P3
   are core nodes (denoted as Transit POGs) in the network. A packet
   service is established by specifying a path between P1 and P4. Note
   that in defining this path, we will need to specify both the nodes
   and the links that make up this service.  POGs advertise themselves
   along with their adjacencies and the domains they belong to. To
   leverage segment routing to define the above service, the ingress
   node P1 would append all outgoing packets in a SR header consisting
   of the SIDs that constitute the path. In the packet domain this would
   mean P1 would send its packets towards P4 using the segment list {P2,
   P4}. The operator would need to use a different mechanism in the
   optical domain to set up the optical paths denoted by O1, O2 and O3.
   Each POG would announce the active optical path as  an opaque
   adjacency - for example, in the case of P1, the optical path O1 would
   represent an optical path that includes the optical nodes Om and On
   as shown on Figure 2. This path is not known to the packet SR domain
   and is only relevant to the optical domain D between P1 and P2.   A
   PCE that is run in Domain D would be responsible for calculating path
   O1.

             |-----Om--------On-----|

       P1----|         (D)          |------P2

             |-----Ox---------Oy----|

   Figure 2: POG with multiple optical paths through an optical domain

   Similarly, the transit POGs P2 and P3 in Figure 1 would announce
   opaque adjacencies O2 and O3.  The border POG would include the
   optical paths O1, O2 and O3 to the segment list for P1 to P4. The
   expanded segment list would read as {O1, P2, O2, P3, O3, P4}. 

   There are potentially two locations for Borders POGs - one that has
   last-mile access nodes and the other being Data Center Interconnect
   nodes.  The POGs that are in the core of the network which connect
   with long haul optical networks are usually Transit POGs.

4.  Mechanism overview

      The current proposal assumes that the SR domains run standard IGP
   protocols to discover the topology and distribute labels without any
   modification. There are also no modifications to the control plane
   mechanisms in the Optical transport domains. The mechanism for
   supporting the opaque adjacency segment is as follows.

      1. Firstly, the Packet Optical Gateway (POG) devices announce
   themselves in the SR domain. This is indicated by advertising a new
   SR node capability flag. The exact extensions to support this
   capability are described in the subsequent sections of this
   document.

      2. Then, the POG devices announce paths to other POGs through the
   optical transport domain as an opaque adjacency segment (opaque
   adjacency SID) in the SR domain.  The paths are announced with an
   appropriate transit domain type, optical transport domain ID, and a
   label to be used to bind to the opaque adjacency segment. The

Internet-Draft        draft-anand-spring-poi-sr-00        March 20, 2016


   appropriate IGP segment routing extensions to carry this information
   is described in the subsequent sections of this document.

      3. The opaque adjacency segment can also optionally be announced
   with a set of attributes that characterizes the path in the optical
   transport domain between the two POG devices. For instance, those
   attributes could define the OTN mapping used (e.g., ODU4,
   ODU3,ODU3e1....ODU1), timeslots (1-8 or 4,6,7 or 1-2,5), or optical
   path protection schemes.

      4. The POG device is also responsible for programming its
   forwarding table to map every opaque adjacency label entry into an
   appropriate forwarding action relevant in the optical domain, such as
   mapping it to a label-switched path. 

      5. The opaque adjacency segment is communicated to the PCE or
   Controller using extensions to BGP-LS or PCEP-LS as described in
   subsequent sections of this document.

      6. Finally, the PCE or Controller then uses the opaque adjacency
   segment label to influence the path leaving the SR domain into the
   optical domain, thereby defining the end-to-end path for a given
   service.





5.  IS-IS extensions for supporting the opaque adjacency segment

   A new IS-IS sub-TLV is defined: the Opaque Adjacency Segment
   Identifier sub-TLV (Opaque-Adj-SID sub-TLV).  The Opaque-Adj-SID sub-
   TLV is an optional sub-TLV carrying the opaque adjacency SID with
   flags and fields that may be used, in future extensions of Segment
   Routing, for carrying other types of Opaque Adjacency SIDs.

      Multiple Opaque-Adj-SID sub-TLVs MAY be associated with a pair of
   POG devices to represent multiple paths within the optical domain
   with perhaps different characteristics.

 Domain ID: An identifier for the transport domain

 Opaque Sub Type: TBD 

 Remote POG Router-ID: 4 octets of OSPFv3 Router-ID

 Packet-Optical Label : according to the V and L flags, it contains 
	either:

      *  A 3 octet local label where the 20 rightmost bits are 
	used for encoding the label value.  In this case the V and 
	L flags MUST be set.

      *  A 4 octet index defining the offset in the label space 
	advertised by this router. In this case V and L flags MUST 
	be unset.


Further, to communicate the Packet-Optical Gateway capability of the
device, we introduce an new optical informational capability bit in the 
Router Information capabilities TLV (as defined in [RFC4970]).

 Bit-24 - Optical - If set, then the router is capable of performing 
	Packet Optical Gateway function.


8.  BGP-LS extensions for supporting the opaque adjacency segment

8.1 Link Attribute TLVs
  The following new Link Attribute TLVs are defined:

   +-----------+----------------------------+----------+---------------+
   |  TLV Code | Description                |   Length |       Section |
   |   Point   |                            |          |               |
   +-----------+----------------------------+----------+---------------+
   |    1101   | Opaque Adjacency Segment   | variable |               |
   |           | Identifier (Opq-Adj-SID)TLV|          |               |
   +-----------+----------------------------+----------+---------------+

                       Table 1: BGP-LS Link Attribute TLVs

  These TLVs can ONLY be added to the Link Attribute associated with 
the link whose local node originates the corresponding SR TLV.

  The Opaque adjacency segment TLV allows a node to advertise an opaque 
adjacency within a single IGP domain.

10. Summary

The motivation for introducing an opaque adjacency segment that is 
separate from an IGP adjacency segment is to distinguish between a 
real IGP adjacency (which is typically a symmetric relationship 
between the devices that share a route flooding domain), and a 
relationship between devices in potentially two different domains such 
as packet and optical domains with no real IGP adjacency. Further, 
the opaque adjacency segment can carry optional information that is 
of significance only in the optical domain, and hence, opaque, to 
the IGPs. This is specifically useful if the optical domain is 
bridging the same IGP domain, then, the POG can attach both the 
adjacency SID and the opaque adjacency SID to influence the 
end-to-end path in the packet and optical domains respectively.
