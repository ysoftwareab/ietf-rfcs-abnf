   Service enabling users to conveniently access such digital resources 
   as e-book, music, moving picture, image, home page, blog page on the 
   world wide web using such simple names as title of contents, author, 
   organization name, blog name, etc. and receive relevant information

         A URN Namespace for the Name Identification Service

1.  Introduction

   Name Identification Service enables general Internet users to easily 
   access to the information on the Internet using such easy-to-remember 
   names as movie titles, publishers, singer names, song titles, etc.[1]
   
   When an Internet user types such book title as "Da Vinci Code" on a 
   web browser or toolbar input window, plug-in module installed on the 
   user's computer changes it into an URN used in the Name 
   Identification Service for the provision of service. 
   
   The name used by a user on a web browser or toolbar input window 
   shall be defined as different Name Identifier(URN) for each country 
   serviced.  Consequently, one name can be registered with different 
   URN for different countries and users can request for differentiated 
   resolution service for the same name by designating service country 
   like "Da Vinci Code/kr" or "Da Vinci Code/us. "  The request of 
   a user shall be changed into a URN containing service providing 
   country information and transmitted to the Name Identification 
   Service center of the relevant country.  Name Identification Service 
   Center of each country creates a HTML containing URL registered on 
   the relevant URN and sends it back to a user as a service response.  
   
   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.

   Declaration of structure:

   All Namespace Specific Strings(NSS) of URN issued through the 
   Name Identification Service shall follow the URN syntax structure 
   defined in the  RFC2141[2]. Name Identifier shall be composed of 
   country code and name separated by colon(":").  The following 
   example describes NSS syntax structure of Name Identifier used in 
   the Name Identification Service.
   
   <Name Identifier NSS> := <Country Code> ":" <Name>
   <Country Code>        := <Alpha> <Alpha>
   <Name>                := 1*<URN Chars>
   <Alpha>               := <Upper> | <Lower>
   <URN Chars>           := <Trans> | "%" <Hex> <Hex>
   <Trans> := <Upper> | <Lower> | <Number> | <Other> | <Reserved>
   <Hex>   := <Number> | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | 
           "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"
   <Upper> := "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" | 
           "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | 
           "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z"
   <Lower> := "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" |
           "j" |"k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | 
           "t" |"u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z"
   <Number> := "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
   <Other>  := " (" | ")" | "+" | "," | "-" | "." | "=" | "@" | ";" | 
            "$" | "_" | "!" | "*" | "'"
   <Reserved> := "%" | "/" | "?" | "#"

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:
      Eman GNS shall establish unique identifiers as appropriate. Name 
      Identifier shall be issued by each country's Name Identification 
      Service Center and a Name Identifier to be issued shall include 
      information on the service country.  Therefore, for the same name,
      a different Name Identifier is issued for each country and 
      a globally same Name Identifier cannot be registered.

   Identifier persistence considerations:
      The Name Identifier registered for a name shall not be changed or 
      reused for a different name.  Therefore, the Name Identifier 
      assigned to a name shall be managed eternally. And Eman GNS will 
      operate a backup service and make an effort to find a substitute 
      in case a Name Identification Service center becomes out of 
      operation.

   Process of identifier assignment:
      Assignment of Name Identifier to a name shall be managed by a 
      Name Identification Center of each service country.  The 
      application of Name Identifier registration for specific name 
      shall be examined before assignment and   Name Identifier is not 
      assigned to all the applied names.  Priority will be given to a 
      public interest than a private interest.  Therefore, even though 
      the time for application is important, it will be taken into 
      account public interest of a Name Identifier.

   Process of identifier resolution:
      When a user types "IETF RFC3401" on a web browser or toolbar 
      input window, a plug-in module installed in a user's computer 
      changes the name into a Name Identifier in the form of 
      "urn:name:kr:IETF+RFC3401." The plug-in module sends a 
      resolution service request of the changed Name Identifier to a 
      resolution server operated in Korea. 
      A user can additionally add country code after name together with 
      "/". For example, if a user types "sony/cn" on a web browser or 
      toolbar input window, a plug-in shall create a Name Identifier in 
      the form of  "urn:name:cn:sony" and send a resolution request to a
      resolution server operated in China.  As shown in the first 
      example, if a user does not designate a service request country, 
      a resolution server of a service user shall be automatically used 
      for the resolution of a Name Identifier.
      A resolution server operated by a Name identification Center of 
      each country shall process the resolution request of a Name 
      Identifier, create a HTML containing URL information requested by 
      a user and send it to a user.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The entire URN is case-insensitive.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      There are no additional characters reserved. The Name Identifier 
      syntax fully conforms to RFC2141 syntax rules.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified

   Scope:

      Global

3.  Namespace Considerations

   URN assignment procedures:
      The assignment and use of identifiers is performed according to 
      the rules established by Eman GNS. It abides by the URN 
      requirements and syntax. Within a NAME namespace, delegates manage 
      subordinate namespaces and maintains the metadata of digital 
      contents.
      
   URN resolution / delegation:
      Resolution is controlled by Eman GNS and its delegates. The list 
      of NAME country codes is maintained by the Registration Management
      Group, Eman GNS. Name Identification Center of each country 
      maintains registered identifiers.
      
   Type of resources to be identified:
      Types of resources to be identified include e-book, music, moving 
      picture, image, home page, blog page, etc.
      
   Type of services to be supported:
      Type of service to be supported include Content Search service 
      controlled web browser toolbar plug-in module in a user's 
      computer. Name Identification Service is available at any place 
      in the world once a user installs a plug-in.

4.  Community Considerations
      
   Open assignment and use of identifiers within the namespace:
      The assignment and use of identifiers within the namespace are 
      open and the related rule is established by Eman GNS. Registration 
      agencies are evaluated and selected fairly and shall have the 
      responsibility for processing registrant's requests 
      for registering digital contents.
      
   Open operation of resolution servers for the namespace (server):
      Registration Management Group (RMG, Eman GNS) and registration 
      agencies shall operate resolution servers for NAME namespace and 
      subordinate namespaces(country code), respectively.
      
   Creation of software that can meaningfully resolve and access 
   services for the namespace (client):
      Digital content users can access to the resolution servers 
      to receive resolution results. The browser plug-in software is 
      developed and resolution servers are now in operation.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes a Name Identifier Namespace registration that
   has been entered into the IANA registry for URN NIDs.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations beyond those normally 
   associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.
