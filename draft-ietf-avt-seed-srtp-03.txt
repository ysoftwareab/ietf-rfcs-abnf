1. Introduction 

   This document describes the use of SEED block cipher algorithm in the 
   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for confidentiality to the 
   RTP traffic and to the control traffic for RTP, the Real-time 
   Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) 

1.1. SEED 

   SEED is a national industrial association standard [TTASSEED] and is 
   widely used in South Korea for electronic commerce and financial 
   services that are operated on wired and wireless communications. 

   As of Sep 2003, its source code in C has been distributed to 600 
   businesses including academic and research institutes by KISA through 
   e-mail. Moreover, there are several international corporations in the 
   number of businesses. 

   The usage of SEED has been covered the security service applications 
   such as e-Commerce, e-mail, dedicated receiver with Broadcasting, 
   financial service, data storage, electronic toll collection, VPN, 
   Digital Right Management, etc. 

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in 
   [ISOSEED] [SEED]. The SEED homepage, http://www.kisa.or.kr, contains 
   a wealth of information about SEED, including detailed specification, 
   evaluation report, test vectors, and so on. 

1.2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119].

2. Cipher Suite Definitions 

   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share common characteristics 
   and valuables, including mode, key size, weak keys, block size, and 
   rounds. The following sections contain description of the relevant 
   characteristics of SEED. 

2.1. Mode 

2.1.1. Counter 

   Section 4.1.1 of [RFC3711] defines AES counter mode encryption, which 
   it refers to as AES-CM. SEED counter mode is defined in a similar 
   manner, and is denoted as SEED_CM respectively. The plaintext inputs 
   to the block cipher are formed as in AES-CM, and the block cipher 
   outputs are processed as in AES-CM. The only difference in the 
   processing is that SEED-CM use SEED. Implementations MUST use SEED-CM 
   in conjunction with an authentication function. The pre-defined 
   authentication transform for SRTP is HMAC-SHA1 [RFC 2104]. SEED-CM 
   use a 112-bit salt as an input, as does AES-CM. 

2.1.2. Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) 

   CCM is a generic authenticate-and-encrypt block cipher mode [CCM]. In 
   this specification, CCM is used with the SEED block cipher. 

   SEED CCM has two parameters: 

      M   M indicates the size of the authentication tag. CCM defines 
          values of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 octets; In [RFC3711], 
          the default authentication tag size is 10 octets. 
          Implementation MUST support M values of 10 octets. 

      L   L indicates the size of the length field in octets. CCM defines 
          values of L between 2 octets and 8 octets. Implementations 
          MUST support an L value of 4 octets, which accommodates a full 
          Jumbogram [JUMBO]; however, the length includes all of the 
          encrypted data. 

   SEED CCM has four inputs: 

      Key 

         An encryption key K suitable for the block cipher. SEED 
         supports 128-bit key, and implementations MUST support this 
         key size.

      Nonce 

         The size of the nonce depends on the value selected for the 
         parameter L. It is 15-L octets. Implementations MUST support a 
         nonce of 11 octets. SEED-CCM nonce is defined as the most 
         significant bit of the initialization vector (IV) defined in 
         section 4.1.1. 

      Payload 

         The payload of the RTP packet. The payload MUST NOT be longer 
         than 4,294,967,295 octets, which is the maximum size of a 
         Jumbogram. 

      AAD 

         The header of the RTP packet. CCM does not allow additional 
         authenticated data (AAD) to be longer than 
         18,446,744,073,709,551,615 octets. 

2.1.3. Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) 

   GCM is a block cipher mode of operation providing both 
   confidentiality and data origin authentication [GCM].GCM is used with 
   the SEED block cipher. 

   SEED-GCM has four inputs: a key, an initialization vector (IV), a 
   payload, and an additional authenticated data (AAD). Four inputs 
   except IV are described in section 2.1.2. 

   SEED-GCM defines an IV. The size of the IV is 12 octets. 
   Implementations MUST support this octet size. SEED-GCM IV is defined 
   as the most significant bit of the initialization vector (IV) defined 
   in section 4.1.1. 

2.2. Key Size and Number of Rounds 

   SEED supports 128-bit key and has the 16-round Feistel structure. 

2.3. Block Size 

   SEED uses a block size of 16 octets (128 bits). 

2.4. Performance  

   Performance figures of SEED are available at 
   http://www.kisa.or.kr/seed/seed_eng.html.

3. Security Considerations 

   No security problem has been found on SEED. SEED is secure against 
   all known attacks including Differential cryptanalysis, linear 
   cryptanalysis, and related key attacks. The best known attack is only 
   an exhaustive search for the key. For further security considerations, 
   the reader is encouraged to read [SEED-EVAL].
