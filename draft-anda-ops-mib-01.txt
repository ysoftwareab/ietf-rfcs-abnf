Abstract

   This document specifies an Open Provisioning Standard (OPS) that
   addresses the needs of an Integrated Communications Network (ICN)
   for remote and automatic service turn-up and for the simplification
   of monitoring and fault management across multiple network elements
   within the Loop Access environment and within the Customer Premises
   Environment (CPE) environment. OPS extends the standard Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Information Base (MIB)
   by defining voice/data integration and flow-through provisioning
   capabilities for the various devices within the ICN, such as
   Integrated Access Devices (IADs).

   OPS enables Carriers or Service Providers to control their
   Integrated Access Services (IAS) from the network management system
   in the Network Operation Center (NOC). Flow-through provisioning
   allows administrators to send provisioning commands to multiple
   network elements across the ICN. The provisioning commands are used
   to define or modify a customer's services and to turn those services
   on and off. Similarly, customer-initiated service requests as well
   as performance and fault management information for existing
   services can flow back to the carrier or service provider.

   The OPS model addresses interoperability from a management
   standpoint across diverse network elements. The OPS model defines
   standardized object elements in the OPS MIB that enable end-to-end
   provisioning in order to support the variety of devices currently in
   use in the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) environment. This
   document explains how the Open Provisioning Standard provides this
   new infrastructure support. This draft contains minor edit changes.

3. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of three major
   components:

   *  SMI for SNMPv2, RFC 1902 [2]
   *  MIB-II for TCP/IP-based Internets, STD 17 (RFC 1213) [3]
   *  SNMP extensions, RFC 1157 [4]
   *  SNMPv2 protocol operations, RFC 1905 [5]

   The following SNMP standards are also important to note:

   *  SNMP textual conventions, RFC 1903 [6]
   *  SNMP conformance statements, RFC 1904 [7]

   The SNMP Management Framework permits new objects to be defined for
   the purpose of experimentation and evaluation.

   This document specifies the Open Provisioning Standard (OPS) MIB
   module which is compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI. A semantically
   identical MIB conforming to the SNMPv1 SMI can be produced through
   the appropriate translation.

   The OPS MIB resides in the experimental branch of the MIB tree under
   object-identifier (OID) 1.3.6.1.3.

3.1. Object Definitions

   The Management Information Base (MIB) is a virtual information
   database. Managed Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of
   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI RFC 1902
   [2].

   Object definitions are used when describing managed objects. An
   ASN.1 macro, OBJECT-TYPE, is used to concisely convey the syntax and
   semantics of a Managed Object. Each OBJECT-TYPE is named by an

Jamp, Hsiao                 Informational                      Page 3

                Definitions of Managed Objects for OPS    October 2000

   assigned name, the OBJECT IDENTIFIER. An object-instance of an
   object-type uniquely identifies a specific instantiation of the
   object.

   Managed Objects are accessed through the use of the SNMP protocols.

4. Overview

4.1 Scope of the OPS MIB

   The Open Provisioning Standard (OPS) MIB defines Managed Objects for
   flow-though provisioning and management functions. This document
   defines two groups of management objects for next-generation
   customer premise equipment (NG-CPE).

   The first object group is of a general configuration nature while
   the second group contains objects similar to the Analog Line
   Termination objects of a GR-303 Remote Terminal (RT) as defined in
   the GR-303-Core document [8].

   Examples of CPE devices include Digital Cross-Connect (DACS) device
   or a Digital Cross-Connect (DACS) device.

   An example of a NG-CPE is an Integrated Access Device (IAD). An IAD
   that has implemented the OPS MIB is referred to as an OPS-compliant
   IAD, abbreviated as OPS-IAD.

   The OPS MIB described in this document focuses on OPS-IADs.

   The OPS MIB will be will be extended at a later time to handle flow-
   through provisioning and management of OPS-CPE devices such as DLC
   and DACS devices. For the remainder of this document, the discussion
   is focused on an OPS-IAD.

   The following additional standard MIBs may be required to complete
   the functions of an OPS-IAD to provide integrated voice and data
   services:

   *  Managed Objects for DS0/DS0 bundle, RFC 2494 [9]
   *  Managed Objects for T1/E1, RFC 2495 [10]
   *  Managed Objects for T3/E3, RFC 2496 [11]
   *  Managed Objects for SONET/SDH, RFC 2558 [12]
   *  Managed Objects for Frame Relay, RFC 1604 [13]
   *  Managed Objects for PPP (link control protocol), RFC 1471 [14]
   *  Managed Objects for PPP (security protocols), RFC 1472 [15]
   *  Managed Objects for PPP (IP control protocol), RFC 1473 [16]
   *  Managed Objects for PPP (bridge control protocol), RFC 1474 [17]
   *  Textual conventions and object-identifiers for ATM, RFC 2514 [18]
   *  Managed Objects for ATM, RFC 2515 [19]
   *  Managed Objects for Ethernet-like interface types, RFC 2665 [20]
   *  MIB-II for TCP/IP-based Internets, STD 17 (RFC 1213) [3]
   *  SNMPv2 MIB for IP using SMIv2, RFC 2011 [21]
   *  SNMPv2 MIB for TCP using SMIv2, 2012 [22]
   *  SNMPv2 MIB for UDP using SMIv2, 2013 [23]

                Definitions of Managed Objects for OPS    October 2000

   *  Managed Objects for Classical IP and ARP over ATM, RFC 2320 [24]
   *  Managed Objects for ADSL (RFC 2662) [25]

   The network management system at the Network Operation Center (NOC)
   performs flow-through provisioning and management of an OPS-IAD
   through an OPS-compliant Multi-Service Access Concentrator (MAS),
   referred to as an OPS-MAS. The ANDA Networks Universal Access
   Platform (UAP) 2000 can function as a MAS device. Flow-through
   provisioning and management commands could arrive at an OPS-MAS in a
   variety of formats. For example, the commands could be in
   Transaction Language 1 (TL1), Common Management Information Protocol
   (CMIP), HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), or SNMP.

   Typically, a Class 5 Switch uses the CMIP protocol, while an IAD
   device uses the SNMP protocol. One of the major functions of an OPS-
   MAS is to translate provisioning commands from the incoming format
   (such as CMIP) into SNMP format before flowing the commands through
   to the OPS-IADs.

4.2 Flow-Through Provisioning Architecture

   Figure 1 provides an architectural view of the end-to-end
   environment where flow-through provisioning can be implemented.

   The OPS-MAS device, for example an ANDA Networks UAP 2000 device,
   connects on the network-side to a PSTN Class 5 Switch (using the GR-
   303 protocol) for voice traffic, and to other devices, such as a
   packet-based ATM/Frame Relay network for data traffic.

   On the other side, the OPS-MAS can directly connect to OPS-IAD
   devices in the CPE environment, through copper-pair wiring using
   technologies such as T1, HDSL or other xDSL. The OPS-MAS can
   indirectly connect to OPS-IAD devices that reside within the local
   loop access network. The loop access network shown in Figure 1
   consists of devices such as DSLAMs and ATM switches.

                Definitions of Managed Objects for OPS    October 2000

4.3. Open Provisioning Standard (OPS)

   There are two views that the network manager at the NOC sees through
   the OPS-MAS and all the attached OPS-IADs.

   The first view regards the voice services coming from the Class 5
   (GR-303) Switch. In this view, the OPS-IAD implements the Analog
   Line Termination objects in the GR-303 managed object definition
   (defined in a GR-303 MIB). The messages coming off the Class 5
   Switch are CMIP messages. The messages between the OPS-MAS and the
   OPS-IADs are SNMP messages. Software residing within the OPS-MAS
   functions as a mediation device between the CMIP messages and SNMP
   messages and translates between the two message formats.

   The second view is an SNMP view, for the management of data and
   voice Services. The network manager at the NOC uses either in-band
   channel through the ATM network or out-band channel through the
   Internet to access an SNMP agent residing in the OPS-MAS. In the
   SNMP protocol, the SNMP agent in the OPS-MAS functions as a proxy
   for the OPS-IAD SNMP agents.

4.4. Voice Service Flow-Through Provisioning

   The network manager at the NOC manages the OPS-MAS and all of the
   OPS-IADs through the Class 5 Switch. The Class 5 Switch and the OPS-
   MAS communicate through the EOC channel using OSI CMIP messages as
   defined in GR-303 Core document [8]. The OPS-MAS can execute
   provisioning commands from the Class 5 Switch either directly or
   indirectly.

   For commands that operate on objects residing on the OPS-MAS, such
   as configuring the number of DS1 channels between the Class 5 Switch
   and the OPS-MAS, these commands are executed within the OPS-MAS.

   For commands that operate on objects residing on the OPS-IAD such as
   phone line ringing cadence, the CMIP message sent from the Class 5
   Switch is translated by the OPS-MAS into an SNMP message and sends
   it to the appropriate OPS-IAD. The OPS-IAD processes the SNMP
   message and sends the response back to the OPS-MAS, which translates
   the SNMP response into a CMIP response and sends it back to the
   Class 5 Switch. The CMIP messages are sent to and from the Class 5
   Switch through the EOC channel.

4.5. Data Service Flow-Through Provisioning

   The network manager at the NOC uses either the in-band channel
   through ATM network or the out-of-band channel through the Internet
   to access the SNMP agent in the OPS-MAS. The OPS-MAS SNMP agent
   represents all the SNMP Managed Objects residing on the OPS-MAS as
   well as the SNMP objects residing in the OPS-IAD. Provisioning
   commands such as configuring ATM VPI/VCI cross connections or
   configuring traffic parameters at the OPS-MAS are executed within
   the MAS.


Jamp, Hsiao                 Informational                      Page 7

                Definitions of Managed Objects for OPS    October 2000

   For commands that operate on objects residing on the OPS-IAD such as
   the Ethernet interface local to the OPS-IAD, the SNMP messages are
   first sent to the OPS-MAS. The OPS-MAS forwards them to the
   appropriate OPS-IAD. The OPS-IAD executes the SNMP messages and
   sends the responses back to the OPS-MAS. The OPS-MAS then returns
   the SNMP responses to the network manager at the NOC.

4.6. Dynamic System Image and Configuration File Upgrades

   The OPS MIB provides the capability for the network manager to
   initiate a software upgrade of the system image file on the OPS-IAD
   and also provides the capability to upload or download the
   configuration database file on the OPS-IAD. The file transfers are
   accomplished by directing a specified TFTP or FTP server to download
   or upload the specified file to the OPS-IAD. Depending on the
   capabilities of the specific IAD, multiple versions of the system
   image and/or configuration database files can be stored on the OPS-
   IAD as well as options about when the IAD is directed to start using
   the newly transferred file(s). Section 5, "OPS MIB Definitions,"
   contains the definitions of these objects with corresponding
   descriptions that explain the usage options/considerations of each
   managed object.

   The following subsections provide a summary of the procedures for
   remotely provisioning and managing the system image and
   configuration database files that reside on the OPS-IAD.

4.6.1 Configure the File Server

   Before uploading or downloading the system image or configuration
   database files, information about the file server must be
   configured. For example these objects are defined in the OPS MIB:

   *  iOpsIADServerIP - indicates the IP address of the file server

   *  iOpsIADServerType - indicates the type of file transfer protocol
      to be used (TFTP, FTP, etc.)

   *  iOpsIADServerLoginName - indicates the name of the file server

   *  iOpsIADServerPasswd  - is the password used to login to the file
      server.

   This information could be configured manually, but can be
   accomplished remotely by using flow-through provisioning.

4.6.2. Dynamic System Image Upgrade

   The following are examples of some of the objects defined in the OPS
   MIB to manage the system image file on the OPS-IAD. Note that not
   all types of IADs can contain multiple system image files. These
   objects are described in more detail in Section 5, "OPS MIB
   Definitions."

                Definitions of Managed Objects for OPS    October 2000

   *  iOpsIADSoftwareFileName - indicates the system image file the IAD
      boots from.

   *  iOpsIADResetIAD - reboots the OPS-IAD with the system image file
      specified in the iOpsIADSoftwareFileName object-type.

   *  iOpsIADSoftwareUpgradeFileName - indicates the name of a new
      system image file name that is to be downloaded to the IAD.

   *  iOpsIADDownloadSoftware - used to initiate the download of the
      new system image file to the OPS-IAD. Is also used to obtain
      information about the status of the download (complete, failed,
      or in progress).

   *  iOpsIADSaveSoftware - provides the option to immediately reboot
      the OPS-IAD with the newly downloaded system image file, or to
      simply save the file for later use.

   *  softwareDownloadComplete - is a notification (SNMPv2 trap) that
      is issued after the attempt to download a new system image file.

4.6.3. Dynamic Configuration File Upgrade

   The following are examples of some of the objects defined in the OPS
   MIB to manage the configuration file (persistent database) on the
   OPS-IAD. Note that not all types of IADs can contain multiple
   configuration files. These objects are described in more detail in
   Section 5, "OPS MIB Definitions."

   *  iOpsIADConfigFileName - indicates the configuration file the IAD
      will use.

   *  iOpsIADReConfigIAD - directs the OPS-IAD to start using the
      configuration file specified in the iOpsIADConfigFileName
      object-type.

   *  iOpsIADConfigUpgradeFileName - indicates the name of a new
      configuration file name that is to be downloaded to the OPS-IAD.

   *  iOpsIADUpDownloadConfiguration - used to initiate the download of
      the new configuration image file to the OPS-IAD. It can also be
      used to upload the configuration image, for example, to replicate
      the persistent database to another OPS-IAD, It can also used to
      obtain information about the status of the download (complete,
      failed, or in progress).

   *  iOpsIADSaveConfiguration - provides the option to immediately
      reboot the OPS-IAD with the newly downloaded configuration file,
      or to simply save the file for later use.

   *  configUpDownloadComplete - is a notification (SNMPv2 trap) that
      is issued after the attempt to download or upload a configuration
      file.

4.7. Additional Object Types in the OPS MIB

   The OPS MIB defines other object types in addition to the examples
   described in the previous sections. All the OPS MIB objects are
   included in Section 5, "OPS MIB Definitions." The following are a
   few examples of the functionality the OPS MIB provides:

   *  Obtain alarm information from the OPS-IAD
   *  Obtain administrative or operational status from the OPS-IAD
   *  Define the types of data service (Frame Relay, ATM, etc.)
   *  Define the number of voice lines and their attributes (Robbed bit
      mode, CRV, etc.)
   *  Place lines 'in service' or 'out of service'
   *  Obtain line information such as line status, line alarms, etc.
   *  Initiate line loopback tests
   *  Obtain notifications (SNMPv2 traps) about line status (traps sent
      when a status change occurs, the time of the last change in
      status, result of loopback testing, etc.)

5. OPS MIB Definitions

   This section describes the OPS MIB objects that all OPS compliant
   CPE shall implement. All provisioning commands to the OPS-CPE will
   be SNMP messages manipulating MIB objects defined in this section.

   'iOpsIADConfig' is a group of Managed Objects that support the
   configuration of the IAD, including the public IP address settings,
   management channel setup, etc.

   'iOpsIADVoiceService' is a group of Managed Objects that support the
   phone services at the IAD.

   -- The Open Provisioning Standard (OPS) MIB defines managed objects
   -- for flow-though provisioning and management functions. This
   -- document defines two groups of management objects for
   -- next-generation customer premise equipment (NG-CPE). The first
   -- group of objects are of a general configuration nature.
   -- The second group of objects are similar to the Analog Line
   -- Termination objects of a GR-303 Remote Terminal as defined in
   -- the GR-303-Core document. A NG-CPE that implements the
   -- OPS MIB is an OPS compliant NG-CPE (OPS-CPE).
   --
   -- The network management systems at the Network Operation Center

   -- OPS-IADs through an OPS-compliant Multi-Service Access
   -- Concentrator (MAS).

           status about the file download or upload:

           1) The SNMP SET PDU message is used to initiate the download
           or upload of the configuration file.
           2) The SNMP GET, GET-NEXT, or GET-BULK messages are used to
           obtain status of the previously initiated download or
           upload.

           When initiating a download or upload, of the configuration
           file, the attributes of this object and the attributes of
           the 'iOpsIADSaveConfiguration' object-type must be included
           in the same SNMP SET PDU message.

           The IP address of the server used to transfer the file or
           the status information is specified in iOpsIADServerIP.

           The server used to download or upload the configuration
           file defaults to the TFTP protocol. However, this default
           may be changed to 'FTP' or to 'other'. It is specified in
           the 'iOpsIADServerType' object-type.

           If an alternate transfer protocol is used, it must first
           be specified before attempting the file download.

           If the IAD is unable to complete the file transfer for any
           reason, the values of the 'iOpsIADAdminStatus' and
           'iOpsIADOperStatus' object-types must remain in the 'up'
           status in order for the IAD to be available to accept
           subsequent requests for configuration file
           downloads or uploads.

           SET PDU message:
           1: Download the configuration file from the server to the
           IAD. The configuration file name is specified in the

           2) When the 'save' option is specified, the IAD will
           continue to use the currently running configuration file.
           In order for the IAD to use the newly downloaded
           configuration file, the network manager should set
           the 'iOpsIADConfigFileName' object-type with the newly

6. Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations. There are a number of managed objects in this
   MIB that may be service affecting if not SET properly. These are:

   *  iOpsIADResetIAD
   *  iOpsIADSoftwareUpgradeFileName
   *  iOpsIADDownloadSoftware
   *  iOpsIADSaveSoftware
   *  iOpsIADReConfigIAD
   *  iOpsIADConfigUpgradeFileName
   *  iOpsIADUpDownloadConfiguration
   *  iOpsIADSaveConfiguration

   It is therefore important to control access to these objects. Not
   all versions of SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is
   no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   can GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in the OPS MIB.

   It is recommended that implementers consider the security features
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use of the User-
   based Security Model, RFC 2274 [26] and the View-based Access
   Control Model RFC 2275 [27] are recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is configured to
   give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that
   have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)
   them.
