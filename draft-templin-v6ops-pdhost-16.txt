                     IPv6 Prefix Delegation Models
                   draft-templin-v6ops-pdhost-16.txt

Abstract

   IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which
   then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks.
   This document considers prefix delegation models according to whether
   the requesting router acts as a router on behalf of any downstream
   networks, as host on behalf of its local applications or as both.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Prefix Delegation (PD) entails 1) the communication of a prefix
   from a delegating router to a requesting router, 2) a representation
   of the prefix in the delegating router's routing table, and 3) a
   control messaging service between the delegating and requesting
   routers to maintain prefix lifetimes.  Following delegation, the
   prefix is available for the requesting router's exclusive use and is
   not shared with any other nodes.  This document considers prefix
   delegation models where the requesting router is a node that acts as
   a router on behalf of any downstream networks, as host on behalf of
   its local applications or as both.  The following paragraphs present
   possibilities for node behavior upon receipt of a delegated prefix.

   For nodes that connect downstream-attached networks (e.g., a
   cellphone that connects a "tethered" Internet of Things (IoT)
   network, a server that hosts a complex internal network of virtual
   machines, etc.), a Delegating Router 'D' delegates a prefix 'P' to a
   Requesting Router 'R' as shown in Figure 1:

                      Figure 1: Classic Routing Model

   In this figure, when Delegating Router 'D' delegates prefix 'P', it
   inserts 'P' into its routing table with Requesting Router ''R' as the
   next hop.  Meanwhile, 'R' receives 'P' via an upstream interface and
   sub-delegates 'P' to its downstream external (physical) and/or
   internal (virtual) networks.  'R' assigns addresses 'A(*)' taken from
   'P' to downstream interfaces, and Hosts 'H(i)' on downstream networks
   assign addresses 'A(*)' taken from 'P' to their interface attachments
   to the downstream link.  'R' then acts as a router between hosts
   'H(i)' on downstream networks and correspondents reachable via other
   interfaces.  'R' can also act as a host on behalf of its local
   applications.  This behavior is per normal router behaviors.

   This document also considers the case when 'R' does not have any
   downstream interfaces, and can use 'P' solely for its own internal

   addressing purposes.  In that case, Requesting node 'R' assigns 'P'
   to a virtual interface (e.g., a loopback) that fills the role of a
   downstream interface.

   'R' can then function under the weak end system (aka "weak host")
   model [RFC1122][RFC8028] by assigning addresses taken from 'P' to a
   virtual interface as shown in Figure 2:

                     Figure 3: Strong End System Model

   The major benefit for a node managing a delegated prefix in either
   the weak or strong end system models is multi-addressing.  With IPv6
   PD-based multi-addressing, the node can configure an unlimited supply
   of addresses to make them available for local applications without
   requiring coordination with other nodes on upstream interfaces.

   The following sections present considerations for nodes that employ
   IPv6 PD mechanisms.

2.  Terminology

   The terminology of the normative references apply, and the terms
   "node", "host" and "router" are the same as defined in [RFC8200].

   The following terms are defined for the purposes of this document:

   shared prefix
      an IPv6 prefix that may be advertised to more than one node on the
      link, e.g., in a Router Advertisement (RA) message Prefix
      Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861].  The router that advertises
      the prefix must consider the prefix as on-link so that the IPv6
      Neighbor Discovery (ND) address resolution function will identify
      the correct neighbor for each packet.

   individual prefix

Internet-Draft      IPv6 Prefix Delegation for Hosts       November 2017


      an IPv6 prefix that is advertised to exactly one node on the link,
      where the node may be unaware that the prefix is individual and
      may not participate in prefix maintenance procedures.  The router
      that advertises the prefix can consider the prefix as on-link or
      not on-link.  In the former case, the router performs address
      resolution and only forwards those packets that match one of the
      node's configured addresses so that the node will not receive
      unwanted packets.  In the latter case, the router can simply
      forward all packets matching the prefix to the node which must
      then drop any packets that do not match one of its configured
      addresses.  An example individual prefix service is documented in
      [I-D.ietf-v6ops-unique-ipv6-prefix-per-host].

   delegated prefix
      an IPv6 prefix that is explicitly conveyed to a node for its own
      exclusive use, where the node is an active participant in prefix
      delegation and maintenance procedures.  The delegating router
      simply forwards all packets matching the prefix to the requesting
      node.  The requesting node associates the prefix with downstream
      and/or internal virtual interfaces (i.e., and not the upstream
      interface).  An example IPv6 PD service is the Dynamic Host
      Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315][RFC3633].  An
      alternative service based solely on IPv6 ND messaging has also
      been proposed [I-D.pioxfolks-6man-pio-exclusive-bit].

3.  Multi-Addressing Considerations

   IPv6 allows nodes to assign multiple addresses to a single interface.
   [RFC7934] discusses options for multi-addressing as well as use cases
   where multi-addressing may be desirable.  Address configuration
   options for multi-addressing include StateLess Address
   AutoConfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862], DHCPv6 address configuration
   [RFC3315], manual configuration, etc.

   Nodes configure addresses from a shared or individual prefix and
   assign them to the upstream interface over which the prefix was
   received.  When the node assigns the addresses, it is required to use
   Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) [RFC3810] to join the appropriate
   solicited-node multicast group(s) and to use the Duplicate Address
   Detection (DAD) algorithm [RFC4862] to ensure that no other node
   configures a duplicate address.

   In contrast, a node that configures addresses from a delegated prefix
   can assign them without invoking MLD/DAD on an upstream interface,
   since the prefix has been delegated to the node for its own exclusive
   use and is not shared with any other nodes.

Internet-Draft      IPv6 Prefix Delegation for Hosts       November 2017


4.  Multi-Addressing Alternatives for Delegated Prefixes

   When a node receives a delegated prefix, it has many alternatives for
   provisioning the prefix to its local interfaces and/or downstream
   networks.  [RFC7278] discusses alternatives for provisioning a prefix
   obtained by a User Equipment (UE) device under the 3rd Generation
   Partnership Program (3GPP) service model.  This document considers
   the more general case when the node receives a delegated prefix
   explicitly provided for its own exclusive use.

   When the node receives the prefix, it can distribute the prefix to
   downstream networks and configure zero or more addresses for itself
   on downstream interfaces.  The node then acts as a router on behalf
   of its downstream networks and configures a default route via a
   neighbor on an upstream interface.

   The node could instead (or in addition) use portions of the delegated
   prefix for its own multi-addressing purposes.  In a first
   alternative, the node can assign as many addresses as it wants from
   the prefix to virtual interfaces.  In that case, applications running
   on the node can use the addresses according to the weak end system
   model.

   In a second alternative, the node can assign as many addresses as it
   wants from the prefix to the upstream interface over which the prefix
   was received.  In that case, applications running on the node can use
   the addresses according to the strong end system model.

   In both of these latter two cases, the node assigns the prefix itself
   to a virtual interface so that unused portions of the prefix are
   correctly identified as unreachable.  The node then acts as a host on
   behalf of its local applications even though neighbors on the
   upstream link see it as a router.

5.  MLD/DAD Implications

   When a node configures addresses for itself from a shared or
   individual prefix, it performs MLD/DAD by sending multicast messages
   over upstream interfaces to test whether there is another node on the
   link that configures a duplicate address.  When there are many such
   addresses and/or many such nodes, this could result in substantial
   multicast traffic that affects all nodes on the link.

   When a node configures addresses for itself from a delegated prefix,
   it can configure as many addresses as it wants but does not perform
   MLD/DAD for any of the addresses over upstream interfaces.  This
   means that the node can configure arbitrarily many addresses without

Internet-Draft      IPv6 Prefix Delegation for Hosts       November 2017


   causing any multicast messaging over the upstream interface that
   could disturb other nodes.

6.  Dynamic Routing Protocol Implications

   Nodes that receive delegated prefixes can be configured to either
   participate or not participate in a dynamic routing protocol over the
   upstream interface, according to the deployment model.  When there
   are many nodes on the upstream link, dynamic routing protocol
   participation might be impractical due to scaling limitations, and
   may also be exacerbated by factors such as node mobility.

   Unless it participates in a dynamic routing protocol, the node
   initially has only a default route pointing to a neighbor via an
   upstream interface.  This means that packets sent by the node over an
   upstream interface will initially go through a default router even if
   there is a better first-hop node on the link.

7.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Implications

   When a node receives a shared or individual prefix with "L=1" and has
   a packet to send to an IPv6 destination within the prefix, it is
   required to use the IPv6 ND address resolution function over the
   upstream interface to resolve the link-layer address of a neighbor
   that configures the address.  When a node receives a shared or
   individual prefix with "L=0" and has a packet to send to an IPv6
   destination within the prefix, if the address is not one of the
   node's own addresses it sends the packet to a default router since
   "L=0" makes no statement about on-link or off-link properties of the
   prefix [RFC4861].

   When a node receives a delegated prefix, it acts as a simple host to
   send Router Solicitation (RS) messages over upstream interfaces
   (i.e., the same as described in Section 4.2 of [RFC7084]) but also
   sets the "Router" flag to TRUE in its Neighbor Advertisement
   messages.  The node considers the upstream interfaces as non-
   advertising interfaces [RFC4861], i.e., it does not send RA messages
   over the upstream interfaces.  The node further does not perform the
   IPv6 ND address resolution function over upstream interfaces, since
   the delegated prefix is by definition not to be associated with an
   upstream interface.

   In all cases, the current first-hop router may send a Redirect
   message that updates the node's neighbor cache so that future packets
   can use a better first-hop node on the link.  The Redirect can apply
   either to a singleton destination address, or to an entire
   destination prefix as described in [I-D.templin-6man-rio-redirect].

8.  ICMPv6 Implications

   The Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv6 (ICMPv6) includes a
   set of control message types [RFC4443] including Destination
   Unreachable (DU).

   According to [RFC4443], routers should return DU messages (subject to
   rate limiting) with code 0 ("No route to destination") when a packet
   arrives for which there is no matching entry in the routing table,
   and with code 3 ("Address unreachable") when the IPv6 destination
   address cannot be resolved.

   According to [RFC4443], hosts should return DU messages (subject to
   rate limiting) with code 3 to internal applications when the IPv6
   destination address cannot be resolved, and with code 4 ("Port
   unreachable") if the IPv6 destination address is one of its own
   addresses but the transport protocol has no listener.

   Nodes that obtain and manage delegated prefixes per this document
   observe the same procedures as described for both routers and hosts
   above.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no IANA considerations.

10.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] and any
   applicable PD mechanisms apply to this document.  Nodes that receive
   delegated prefixes do not perform MLD/DAD procedures on their
   upstream interfaces, meaning that they cannot contribute to multicast
   messaging congestion on the upstream link.  Also, routers that
   delegate prefixes keep only a single neighbor cache entry for each
   prefix delegation recipient, meaning that the router's neighbor cache
   cannot be subject to resource exhaustion attacks.

   For shared and individual prefixes, if the router that advertises the
   prefix considers the prefix as on-link the IPv6 ND address resolution
   function will prevent unwanted IPv6 packets from reaching the node.
   For delegated prefixes and individual prefixes that are not
   considered on-link, the router delivers all packets that match the
   prefix to the unicast link-layer address of the node (i.e., as
   determined by resolution of the node's link-local address) even if
   they do not match one of the node's configured addresses.  In the
   latter case, the node may receive unwanted IPv6 packets via an
   upstream interface that do not match either a configured IPv6 address
   or a transport listener.  The node then drops the packets and

   observes the "Destination Unreachable - Address/Port unreachable"
   procedures discussed in Section 8.

   The node may also receive IPv6 packets via an upstream interface that
   do not match any of the node's delegated prefixes.  In that case, the
   node drops the packets and observes the "Destination Unreachable - No
   route to destination" procedures discussed in Section 8.  Dropping
   the packets is necessary to avoid a reflection attack that would
   cause the node to forward packets received from an upstream interface
   via the same or a different upstream interface.

   In all cases, the node must decide whether or not to send DUs
   according to the specific operational scenario.  In trusted networks,
   the node should send DU messages to provide useful information to
   potential correspondents.  In untrusted networks, the node can
   refrain from sending DU messages to avoid providing sensitive
   information to potential attackers.
