1.   The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
   [RFC2580]. 
    
2.   Introduction 
    
   A multimedia terminal adapter (MTA) is used to deliver broadband 
   Internet, data, and/or voice access jointly with telephony service to

   a subscriber's or customer's premises using a cable network 
   infrastructure. A MTA is normally installed at the customer's or 
   subscriber's premises, and it is coupled to a multiple system 
   operator (MSO) using a hybrid fiber coax (HFC) access network. 
    
   A MTA is provisioned by the MSO for broadband Internet, data, and/or 
   voice service. For more information on MTA provisioning refer to 
   [PKT-SP-PROV] and [RFCXYZ]. MTA devices include one or more endpoints 
   (e.g., telephone ports) which receive call signaling information to 
   establish ring cadence, and codecs used for providing telephony 
   service.  
    
   For more information on call signaling refer to [PKT-SP-MGCP] and 
   [RFC3435].  
    
   For more information on codecs refer to [PKT-SP-CODEC]. 
    
   Given the complexity of such systems it is important that a suitable 
   event management mechanism be defined to allow for effective 
   management. This MIB module provides objects suitable for generation 
   and management of events on the MTA.  
    
3.   Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 
    
   The terms "MIB module" and "information module" are used 
   interchangeably in this memo.  As used here, both terms refer to any 
   of the three types of information modules defined in Section 3 of RFC 
   2578 [RFC2578]. Some of the terms used in this memo are defined  
   below.  Some additional terms are also defined in the PacketCable(TM) 
   Management Event Mechanism Specification [PKT-SP-MEM1.5] and the  
   PacketCable MTA Device Provisioning Specification [PKT-SP-PROV]. 
    
3.1    PacketCable  
   PacketCable is a CableLabs-led initiative that is aimed at developing 
   interoperable interface specifications for delivering advanced, real-
   time multimedia services over two-way cable plants. 
    
3.2    IPCableCom 
   IPCableCom is an ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) 
   project that includes architecture and a series of recommendations 
   that enable the delivery of real time services over the cable 
   television networks using cable modems. 
    
3.3    MTA

PacketCable/IPCablecom Event management MTA MIB          February 2006 
 
 
   A Multimedia Terminal Adapter (MTA) is a PacketCable or IPCablecom 
   compliant device providing telephony services over a cable or hybrid 
   system used to deliver video signals to a community. It contains an 
   interface to endpoints, a network interface, CODECs, and all 
   signaling and encapsulation functions required for Voice over IP 
   transport, call signaling, and Quality of Service signaling. A MTA 
   can be an embedded or a standalone device. An Embedded MTA (E-MTA) is 
   a MTA device containing an embedded Data Over Cable Service Interface 
   Specifications (DOCSIS) Cable Modem. A Standalone MTA (S-MTA) is a 
   MTA device separated from the DOCSIS Cable Modem by non-DOCSIS MAC 
   interface (e.g., Ethernet, USB). 
    
3.4    Endpoint 
   An endpoint or MTA endpoint is a standard RJ-11 telephony physical 
   port located on the MTA and used for attaching the telephone device 
   to the MTA. 
 
    
3.5     MSO  
   Multi-System Operator. A cable company that operates many head-end 
   locations in several cities.  
      
    
3.6    UDP  
   User Datagram Protocol. A connectionless protocol built upon Internet 
   Protocol (IP), as per RFC 768 [RFC768].  
     
    
4.   Overview  
   This MIB module provides a set of objects required for generation and 
   management of events on PacketCable, European Telecommunications 
   Standards Institute (ETSI), and International Telecommunication Union 
   Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) IPCablecom compliant 
   Multimedia Terminal Adapter (MTA) devices. The EVENT MIB module is 
   intended to supersede various EVENT MIB modules from which it is 
   partly derived: 
     - the PacketCable 1.5 Management Event MIB Specification  
       [PKT-SP-EVEMIB1.5], 
     - the ITU-T IPCablecom management event mechanism MIB requirements 
       [ITU-T-J176]  
    
   Several normative and informative references are used to help define 
   Management Event MIB objects.  As a convention, wherever the 
   requirements are equivalent at the time of the writing, the 
   PacketCable reference is used. However, MTA implementations MUST 
   refer to the corresponding specifications to ensure compliance.

4.1    Structure of the MIB  
    
   This MIB is structured in six groups:  
    
   - Management information that controls the event reporting   
     (pktcDevEventControl).  
    
    
   - Management information that configures the event throttling control        
     (pktcDevEventThrottle).  
    
   - Management information reflecting the status of the event 
     transmission (pktcDevEventStatus).  
    
   - Management information that specifies the possible events that can 
     be generated by the MTA (pktcDevEventDescr).  
    
   - Management information related to the events generated by the MTA 
     (pktcDevEventLog). 
    
   - Management information that defines the trap and inform messages       
     (pktcDevEvNotification).

9.   IANA Considerations  
        
      The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned  
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:  
        
      Descriptor     OBJECT IDENTIFIER Value  
      ----------     -----------------------  
      pktcIetfEventMib     { mib-2 XXX }  
        
      Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is  
      requested to assign a value for XXX under the mib-2 subtree and to  
      record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry. When the  
      assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace XXX  
      (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove  
      this note. 
    
10.    Security Considerations  
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments. Security threats include events unreported on errors, 
   redirection of events (deliberately or otherwise) or minimized 
   reporting of errors. Such threats can mask certain misconfiguration 
   attempts and denial of service attacks that can be recognized and 
   thwarted via event reporting. 
    
   MIB objects of significance include: 
   - those that control the event generation, the target syslog address  
   for events and the reporting status, i.e.: 
       pktcDevEvControl 
       pktcDevEvSyslogAddressType 
       pktcDevEvSyslogAddress 
       pktcDevEvSyslogUdpPort 
        
       pktcDevEventReportStatus 
    
   - those related to event classes, i.e.: 
       pktcDevEventClassSeverityLevel 
    
   - those related to throttling, i.e.: 
 
 
De Ketelaere/Nechamkin/Channabasappa Expires - August 2006   [Page 27] 
PacketCable/IPCablecom Event management MTA MIB          February 2006 
 
 
       pktcDevEvThrottleAdminStatus 
       pktcDevEvThrottleThreshold 
       pktcDevEvThrottleInterval 
    
   - those related to the event reporting capabilities of an MTA, i.e: 
       pktcDevEventDescrSeverityLevel 
       pktcDevEventDescrReporting 
       pktcDevEventDescrText 
       pktcDevEventDescrClass 
 
 
 
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects 
   with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered 
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus 
   important to control even GET access to these objects and possibly 
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over 
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability: 
 
   pktcDevEventLogTable: This table contains the log of generated event 
   messages. Read access to this table might reveal some specific 
   information that should be kept confidential. 
    
   pktcDevEvTransmissionStatus: This MIB Object reveals the status of 
   event transmission and MAY be sensitive in some environments. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network 
   is allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
   objects in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms 
   (for authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT  
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to 
   an instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give 
   access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
   legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
