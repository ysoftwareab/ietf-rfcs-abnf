                   Point to Multipoint BFD for TRILL
                     draft-zhang-trill-p2mp-bfd-00

Abstract

   Point to multipoint (P2MP) BFD is designed to verify multipoint
   connectivity.  This document specifies the support of P2MP BFD in
   TRILL.  Similar as TRILL point to point BFD, BFD Control packets in
   TRILL P2MP BFD are also transmitted using an extended RBridge
   Channel.

1.  Introduction

   TRILL supports multicast forwarding.  Applications based on TRILL
   multicast wish to achieve quick detection of multicast failures using
   P2MP BFD.  This document specifies the use of P2MP BFD in TRILL.

   To use P2MP BFD, the head need to periodically transmit BFD Control
   packets to all tails using TRILL multicast.  A new RBridge Channel is
   allocated for this purpose.

   In order to execute the global protction of distribution used for
   multicast forwarding [I-D.ietf-trill-resilient-trees], the head need
   to track the active status of tails
   [spallagatti-bfd-multipoint-active-tail].  When the tail loses
   connectivity from the head, it should notify the head of the lack of
   multipoint connectivity with unicast BFD Control packets.  These
   packets are transmitted using the existing RBridge Channel assigned
   to BFD Control [RFC7175].

2.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Familiarity with [RFC6325][RFC7175][RFC7178] is assumed in this
   document.

3.  Bootstrapping

   The TRILL adjacency mechanism bootstraps the establishment of the BFD
   session [RFC7177].  A slight wording update to the second sentence in
   Section 6 of [RFC7177] is required.

   It currently read:

      If an RBridge supports BFD [RFC7175], it will have learned whether
      the other RBridge has BFD enabled by whether or not a BFD-Enabled
      TLV [RFC6213] was included in its Hellos.

   Now it should read:

      If an RBridge supports BFD [RFC7175] [this document], it will have
      learned whether the other RBridge has BFD enabled by whether or
      not a BFD-Enabled TLV [RFC6213] was included in its Hellos.

4.  A New RBridge Channel for P2MP BFD

   RBridge Channel 0x002 is defined for TRILL point to point BFD Control
   packets in [RFC7175].  If the M bit of the TRILL Header of the
   channeled packet containing the BFD Control packet is non-zero, the
   packet MUST be dropped [RFC7175].  While for P2MP BFD, the head is
   required to probe tails using multicast.  This means the M bit will
   be set to 1.  For this reason, a new RBridge Channel, whose code
   point is TBD, is specified in this document.  An RBridge that
   supports P2MP BFD MUST support the new RBridge Channel for P2MP BFD.
   The capability to support the RBridge Channel for P2MP BFD, and
   therefore support performing P2MP BFD, is announced within the
   "RBridge Channel Protocols Sub-TLV" in LSPs [RFC7176].

   An alternative option is to define a new RBridge Channel Tunnel
   protocol for P2MP BFD Control packets [I-D.ietf-trill-channel-tunnel]
   so that P2MP BFD Control Packets can be adapted as the payload of
   this Tunnel protocol.

   As specified in [RFC7178], when the tail receives TRILL Data packets
   sent on the channel, it will absorb the packets itself rather than
   deliever these packets to its attached end-stations.

5.  Discriminators and Packet Demultiplexing

   In [I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint], the tail demultiplexes incoming BFD
   packets based on a combination of the source address and My
   Discriminator.  In addition to this combination, TRILL P2MP BFD
   requires the tail to use the Data Label, which is either the inner
   VLAN or the Fine Grained Label [RFC7172], for demultiplexing.  If the
   tail need to notify the head about the failure of a multipath, the
   tail is required to send unicast BFD Control packets using the same
   Data Label as used by the head.

6.  Tracking Active Tails

   According to[I-D.ietf-bfd-multipoint], the head has a session of type
   MultipointHead that is bound to a multipoint path.  Multipoint BFD
   Control packets are sent by this session over the multipoint path,
   and no BFD Control packets are received by it.  Each tail dynamically
   creates a MultipointTail per a multipoint path.  MultipointTail
   sessions receive BFD Control packets from the head over multipoint
   paths.

   If the head is keeping track of some or all of the tails
   [I-D.ietf-trill-resilient-trees], it has a session of type
   MultipointClient per tail that it cares about
   [spallagatti-bfd-multipoint-active-tail].  See
   [spallagatti-bfd-multipoint-active-tail] for detail operations of
   tacking active tails.

7.  Security Considerations

   P2MP BFD control packets can be encapsulated as the payload of the
   RBridge Channel Tunnel [I-D.ietf-trill-channel-tunnel].  In that
   case, the security option of RBridge Channel Tunnel can secure the
   transmission of BFD control packets.

   The demultiplexing of TRILL P2MP BFD at the tail is Data Label aware.
   This enhances the security of the dynamic creation of MultipointTail
   sessions at tails.  In order to forge BFD Control packets, the
   attacker has to acquire the right Data Label that the head uses for
   P2MP BFD.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is required to allocate one RBridge Channel protocol number from
   the Standards Action range, as follows:

          Protocol          Number
          --------          ------
          P2MP BFD Control  TBD
