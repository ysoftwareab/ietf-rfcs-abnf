     Internationalized Electronic Mail Addresses in RFC5280 / X.509
                              Certificates
                        draft-lbaudoin-iemax-02

Abstract

   Specifies support for email address internationalization in RFC5280 /
   X.509 certificates.  This defines an encoding for Unicode email
   local-part characters in certificate Subject Alternative Names and
   Issuer Alternative rfc822Names.  The encoding is backwards compatible
   with existing practices with rfc822Name.

1.  Background

   Internationalization of email addresses has significant precedence.
   Email addresses and their parts are specified in [RFC5322].
   Internationalization of domain names was specified in [RFC3490] and
   more recently in [RFC5890] via puny-coding of the unicode domain name
   labels.  Email address as certificate Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
   and Issuer Alternative Name (IAN) rfc822Name support this
   internationalization of domain names as described in section 7.5 of
   [RFC5280].  In [RFC6532], email headers as specified in [RFC5321] and
   [RFC5322] was refined to support UTF-8 unicode representation which
   implies support for Unicode email addresses but RFC5280 was not
   updated to take Unicode email local-part into account.

2.  Proposal

   This draft proposes an encoding for internationalized email addresses
   with Unicode local-part.  This encoding is a further refinement of
   email addresses in RFC5280 SAN and IAN rfc822Name thus allowing
   existing PKI practices using email addresses to continue.  To support
   the Unicode local-part, this draft proposes a base64 encoding for the
   local-part string with an identifier character to distinguish this
   encoding.  That is the encoded string starts with an escape character
   ':' to identify that the local-part is Unicode and that the
   successive characters contain the base64 encoded local-part until the
   '@' at character is seen.  The escape colon character is a character
   intentionally choosen such that it is supported by IA5String but not
   possible in a compliant ASCII RFC5322 email addresses.  The local-
   part of the email address then consists of Unicode UTF-8 name that
   must be websafe base64url encoded as specifed in [RFC4648].  Support
   for internationalized domain names in the certificates is already
   specified in RFC5280, and this draft does not change that
   interpretation for the email domain.  Similarly the email address
   must follow existing Mailbox name practices specified in RFC5280
   section 4.2.1.6 that there must be no common name, no comment, nor

   "<" or ">" present.  A compliant reader of the encoded email address
   would strip the escape ':' and decode the base64 local-part to UTF-8.

   One potential issue for an encoded internationalized SAN or IAN email
   address is its impact on RFC5280 naming constraints particularly
   between a draft compliant certificate and a non compliant
   implementation.  This encoding will not impact name matching in this
   scenario as mismatching local-part names and constraints will always
   match test negatively.  The local-parts should only match if the
   implementation is compliant with this draft.  Because the draft does
   not change internationalized domain name behavior, both the compliant
   and non-compliant implementation can test domain name constraints in
   the expected way.
