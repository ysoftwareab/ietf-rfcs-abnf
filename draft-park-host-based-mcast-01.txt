Abstract

     This document specifies an extension to the multicast addressing
     architecture of the IPv6 protocol.  The extension allows for using
     interface-ID to allocate multicast addresses.  When the link-local
     unicast address is configured at each interface of host, interface
     ID is uniquely determined.  By delegating multicast addresses at
     the same time as interface ID, each host can identify their
     multicast addresses automatically at Layer 1 without needing to run
     an intra- or inter-domain allocation protocol in the serverless
     environments.

1. Introduction

     This specification defines an extension to the multicast portion of
     the IPv6 addressing architecture [ADDRARCH].  The current
     architecture does not contain any built-in support for dynamic
     address allocation.  The extension allows for using interface-ID to
     allocate multicast addresses.  When the link-local unicast address
     is configured at each interface of host, interface ID is uniquely
     determined.  By delegating multicast addresses at the same time as
     interface ID, each host can identify its multicast addresses
     automatically without needing to run an intra- or inter-domain
     allocation protocol in the serveless environments.

     The current multicast address allocation architecture [RFC 2908] is
     based on a multi-layered, multi-protocol system.  The goal of this
     proposal is to reduce the number of protocols and servers that need
     to be deployed in order to get dynamic multicast address
     allocation.

     The use of interface ID-based multicast address allocation will, at
     a minimum, remove the need to run the Multicast Address Allocation
     Protocol (AAP) [AAP WORK][RFC 2909] and the Multicast Address
     Allocation servers [RFC 2908].

     This document specifies encoded information in the multicast
     address to allow for dynamic allocation of IPv6 multicast
     addresses.


2. Terminology

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
     "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
     this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].


3. Host-based multicast address format

     Section 2.7 of [ADDRARCH] defines the following operational format
     of IPv6 multicast addresses:
     

     |    8   |  4 |  4 |                     112                     |
     +--------+----+----+---------------------------------------------+
     |11111111|flgs|scop|                  group ID                   |
     +--------+----+----+---------------------------------------------+

Internet-Draft Host-based IPv6 Multicast Addresses Allocation    Feb. 2002


     This document introduces new formats that incorporate interface ID
     information in the multicast address.  The idea delegating
     multicast addresses at the same time as interface ID, can be
     applicable to link-local. 

     Figure 2  illustrates the new format for link-local multicast
     addresses.


     |   8    | 4  | 4  |     16     |       64       |       32      |
     +--------+----+----+------------+----------------+---------------+
     |11111111|flgs|scop|  reserved  |  Interface ID  |    group ID   |
     +--------+----+----+------------+----------------+---------------+

          Figure 2:  Host-based link-local multicast address format


                                     +-+-+-+-+ 
     flgs is a set of 4 flags:       |0|0|P|T|
                                     +-+-+-+-+

         o P = 0 indicates a multicast address that is not assigned
                 based on the network prefix or interface ID.
         o P = 1 indicates a multicast address that is assigned
                 based on the network prefix or interface ID.
         o If P = 1, T MUST be set to 1, otherwise the setting of
                     the T bit is defined in Section 2.7 of RFC 2373.

     flgs should use the same flag defined in section 3 of [UNIMULTI].
     That is, this document proposes the third bit of 'flgs' field to
     indicates a host-based multicast address. Additionly, it is
     required to distinguish between host-based multicast address and
     unicast-prefix-based multicast address.

     scop <= 2. The scope of this multicast address MUST be independent 
     of the scope of the unicast address, which derives the interface ID 
     embedded in the multicast address.

     The reserved field MUST be zero.

     interface ID field is used to distinguish each host from others.
     And this value is obtained from IEEE EUI-64 based interface 
     identifier of the link-local unicast IPv6 address.

     group ID is generated randomly to indicate multicast application
     and is used to guarantee its uniqueness only in host.

     The lifetime of a host-based multicast address has no dependency to
     the Valid Lifetime field in the Prefix Information option,
     corresponding to the unicast address being used, contained in the
     Router Advertisement message [RFC 2461].

Internet-Draft Host-based IPv6 Multicast Addresses Allocation    Feb. 2002


4. Considerations

     Unlike 00 version, this draft considers only the link-local 
     multicast addresses. For consistency, some modifications in 
     [UNIMULTI] draft are required. For example, by restrictng 
     the syntax to scope > 2 in [UNIMULTI].
     
     We also think that this draft is applicable to site-local
     multicast addresses and requires the coordination with 
     [UNIMULTI] draft.
     
     Our proposal is also new method applicable to the zeroconf
     environment.


5. Security considerations

     [RFC3041] describes the privacy extension to IPv6 stateless 
     address autoconfiguration for interface ID. So, [RFC3041] 
     satisfied our requirements.
