                   Resilient MPLS Rings and Multicast
                   draft-zzhang-mpls-rmr-multicast-03

Abstract

   With Resilient MPLS Rings (RMR), although all existing multicast
   procedures and solutions can work as is, there are optimizations that
   could be done for RSVP-TE P2MP tunnel signaling and Fast-ReRouting
   for both mLDP and RSVP-TE P2MP tunnels.  This document describes RMR
   multicast on a high level, with detailed protocol procedure for RSVP-
   TE P2MP optimizations specified in a separate document.  This
   document also discusses end to end multicast when there are RMRs.

1.  Introduction

   This document discusses how multicast works with Resilient MPLS Rings
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-rmr].  It is expected that readers are familiar with
   the concept and terms in [I-D.ietf-mpls-rmr].

   All existing multicast procedures and solutions can work as is.  This
   include both mpls multicast tunnels and end-to-end multicast that
   makes use of multicast tunnels.  Ring topology is just a special case
   of general topologies so all existing RSVP-TE P2MP [RFC4875] and mLDP
   [RFC6388] tunnels can be set up using existing protocols and
   procedures.  An Ingress Replication (IR) tunnel [RFC7988] consists a
   bunch of P2P LSPs, and it does not matter whether a component LSP is
   a plain old LSP or a Ring LSP.

   On the other hand, there are optimizations that could be done for
   RSVP-TE P2MP tunnel signaling and Fast-ReRouting (FRR) for both mLDP
   and RSVP-TE P2MP tunnels.  This document describes that on a high
   level, and discusses end to end multicast when there are RMRs even
   though RMR could be transparent to multicast.

2.  P2MP/MP2MP Tunnels on a Ring

   Because mLDP label mapping messages are merged as they propagate from
   the leaves towards the root, ring topology does not lead to any
   further optimization in tunnel signaling.

   However RSVP-TE P2MP tunnel signaling and procedures can be greatly
   optimized, as specified in [I-D.zzhang-teas-rmr-rsvp-p2mp].

2.1.  Tunnel Protection and FRR

   Each node on a ring signals two counter-rotating MP2P Ring LSPs to
   itself.  As these LSPs are self-signaled after the discovery of the
   ring, they can be used to protect P2MP LSPs on ring.  So neither mLDP
   nor RSVP-TE has to setup a separate P2P bypass LSPs for link and node
   protection.  For instance, consider a ring with 8 nodes:

                                Root
                                R0 . . . R1
                              .             .

                           R7                 R2 Leaf
                   |       .                  .        |
         Anti-     |       .      RingID=17   .        |
         Clockwise v       .                  .        v Clockwise
                      Leaf R6                 R3
                              .             .
                                R5 . . . R4  Leaf

                       Figure 1: Ring with 8 nodes

   Further, suppose a P2MP LSP is signaled with R0 as a root and R2, R4
   and R6 as leafs.  The P2MP LSP is formed as follows:

                                  R0
                                .   .
                               .     .
                              .       .
                             R6       R2
                                      .
                                      .
                                      R4

                      Figure 2: P2MP LSP

   In the event of a link failure between R2 and R3, R2 the Point of
   Local Repair (PLR) tunnels P2MP LSP traffic on a anti-clockwise ring
   LSP to R3 the Merge Point (MP).  Once the traffic is out of the ring



Zhang & Esale           Expires November 8, 2019                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  rmr-mcast                       May 2019


   LSP on R3, it uses the regular P2MP LSP to reach R4.  Similarly in
   the event of a node failure R3, R2 the PLR tunnels P2MP LSP traffic
   to R4 (the MP), which is also the leaf.  Thus, the P2MP LSP uses the
   existing RSVP-TE ring LSPs for link and node protection.

3.  End to End Tunnels with Rings

   Consider a provider network that consists of one or more rings,
   optionally with a general topology connecting the rings.  Multicast
   VPN [RFC6514], Ethernet VPN [RFC7432], VPLS [RFC4761] [RFC4762], or
   Global Table Multicast (GTM) via MVPN [RFC7716] overlay services are
   provided where end-to-end multipoint tunnels are needed across the
   entire network.

   If the end to end tunnels are established by RSVP-TE P2MP, there is
   not much optimization that can be done for RMR, unless overlay-
   assisted tunnel segmentation is used.  That is described in
   Section 4.3.1.

   If the end to end tunnels are established by mLDP and RSVP-TE
   signaling is desired on part of the network, mLDP Over Targeted
   Sessions [RFC7060] can be used (without the help from the overlay
   service) to stack part of an mLDP tunnel over a RSVP-TE P2MP tunnel.
   If the RSVP-TE P2MP tunnel is over a ring, then the optimization
   described earlier can be used.

4.  End to End Native Multicast with Rings

   Consider a network that consists of some rings.  In this network,
   end-to-end native multicast can take various forms described below.

4.1.  Native Multicast in the Global Routing Table

   This is typically signaled by PIM [RFC7761] end to end.  This works
   for any topology and RMR does not make any difference.

4.2.  mLDP Inband Signaling

   This is specified in [RFC6826] [RFC7246] [RFC7438].  When part of a
   native (s,g) or (*,g) multicast tree needs to go over an mLDP domain,
   an mLDP tunnel is created for each multicast tree for the domain.
   RMR does not make any differences here.

4.3.  Overlay Multicast Services

   Overlay multicast services provided by MVPN/GTM/EVPN/VPLS use overlay
   multicast signaling to signal customer multicast state and tunnel
   binding.  PE-PE multipoint underlay tunnels are used to distribute

Internet-Draft                  rmr-mcast                       May 2019


   multicast packets among PEs.  Any kind of tunnel can be used, whether
   the provider network has rings or not, with or without the RMR
   related optimizations (Section 3).

4.3.1.  Tunnel Segmentation

   The MVPN/GTM/EVPN/VPLS PEs could span across ASes or areas.  When the
   PE-PE multipoint tunnels cannot be signaled across AS/area
   boundaries, segmentation procedures can be used, as specified in
   [RFC6514, RFC7024] and [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-bum-procedure-updates].
   With the base MVPN/GTM/EVPN/VPLS procedures, PEs advertise I/S-PMSI
   A-D routes to signal traffic to tunnel binding, and the routes carry
   type and identification of multi-point tunnels used to carry
   corresponding traffic.  With segmentation, the ASBRs/ABRs become
   segmentation points and they change the tunnel type/identification
   when they re-advertise the routes to the next AS/area.  With this,
   each AS/area has its own tunnel of different type/identification,
   stitched together by the ASBRs/ABRs.

   With segmentation, different RMRs could have their own tunnels, and
   RSVP-TE P2MP optimizations for RMRs could be applied.  Notice that
   this is different from Section 3 in that overlay signaling is
   involved.

5.  Summary

   As described above, multicast in the presence of RMRs can work as is.
   RSVP-TE P2MP tunnel signaling can be optimized (to be specified
   separately).  Tunnel protection/FRR can also be optimized for mLDP/
   RSVP-TE P2MP tunnels.

6.  Security Considerations

   This is an informational document that describes how existing
   multicast protocols can be used with RMR, as well as possible RMR
   specific enhancements that will be specified separately.  There are
   no security concerns to be discussed here, as they are already
   discussed in existing protocols or will be discussed in the
   specification for the enhancements.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any allocations from IANA.  The RFC
   Editor is requested to remove this section before publication.
