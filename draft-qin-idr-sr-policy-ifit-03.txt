                BGP SR Policy Extensions to Enable IFIT
                    draft-qin-idr-sr-policy-ifit-03

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) policy is a set of candidate SR paths consisting
   of one or more segment lists and necessary path attributes.  It
   enables instantiation of an ordered list of segments with a specific
   intent for traffic steering.  In-situ Flow Information Telemetry
   (IFIT) refers to network OAM data plane on-path telemetry techniques,
   in particular the most popular are In-situ OAM (IOAM) and Alternate
   Marking.  This document defines extensions to BGP to distribute SR
   policies carrying IFIT information.  So that IFIT methods can be
   enabled automatically when the SR policy is applied.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy]
   is a set of candidate SR paths consisting of one or more segment
   lists and necessary path attributes.  It enables instantiation of an
   ordered list of segments with a specific intent for traffic steering.

   In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (IFIT) denotes a family of flow-
   oriented on-path telemetry techniques (e.g.  IOAM, Alternate
   Marking), which can provide high-precision flow insight and real-time
   network issue notification (e.g., jitter, latency, packet loss).In
   particular, IFIT refers to network OAM data plane on-path telemetry
   techniques, including In-situ OAM (IOAM) [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data]



Qin, et al.               Expires March 6, 2021                 [Page 2]

Internet-Draft             bgp-sr-policy-ifit             September 2020


   and Alternate Marking [RFC8321].  It can provide flow information on
   the entire forwarding path on a per- packet basis in real time.

   An automatic network requires the Service Level Agreement (SLA)
   monitoring on the deployed service.  So that the system can quickly
   detect the SLA violation or the performance degradation, hence to
   change the service deployment.  For this reason, the SR policy native
   IFIT can facilitate the closed loop control and enable the automation
   of SR service.

   This document defines extensions to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to
   distribute SR policies carrying IFIT information.  So that IFIT
   behavior can be enabled automatically when the SR policy is applied.

   This BGP extension allows to signal the IFIT capabilities together
   with the SR-policy.  In this way IFIT methods are automatically
   activated and running.  The flexibility and dynamicity of the IFIT
   applications are given by the use of additional functions on the
   controller and on the network nodes, but this is out of scope here.

2.  Motivation

   IFIT Methods are being introduced in multiple protocols and below is
   a proper picture of the relevant documents for Segment Routing.
   Indeed the IFIT methods are becoming mature for Segment Routing over
   the MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and Segment Routing over IPv6 data
   plane (SRv6), that is the main focus of this draft:

      IOAM: the reference documents for the data plane are
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options] for SRv6 and
      [I-D.gandhi-mpls-ioam-sr] for SR-MPLS.

      Alternate Marking: the reference documents for the data plane are
      [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark] for SRv6 and
      [I-D.ietf-mpls-rfc6374-sfl], [I-D.gandhi-mpls-rfc6374-sr] for SR-
      MPLS.

   The definition of these data plane IFIT methods for SR-MPLS and SRv6
   imply requirements for various routing protocols, such as BGP, and
   this document aims to define BGP extensions to distribute SR policies
   carrying IFIT information.  This allows to signal the IFIT
   capabilities so IFIT methods are automatically configured and ready
   to run when the SR Policy candidate paths are distributed through
   BGP.

   It is to be noted that, for PCEP, [I-D.chen-pce-pcep-ifit] proposes
   the extensions to PCEP to distribute paths carrying IFIT information
   and therefore to enable IFIT methods for SR policy too.

3.  IFIT Attributes in SR Policy

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy], the SR Policy
   encoding structure is as follows:

         SR Policy SAFI NLRI: <Distinguisher, Policy-Color, Endpoint>
         Attributes:
            Tunnel Encaps Attribute (23)
               Tunnel Type: SR Policy
                   Binding SID
                   Preference
                   Priority
                   Policy Name
                   Explicit NULL Label Policy (ENLP)
                   Segment List
                       Weight
                       Segment
                       Segment
                       ...
                   ...

   A candidate path includes multiple SR paths, each of which is
   specified by a segment list.  IFIT can be applied to the candidate
   path, so that all the SR paths can be monitored in the same way.  The
   new SR Policy encoding structure is expressed as below:

         SR Policy SAFI NLRI: <Distinguisher, Policy-Color, Endpoint>
         Attributes:
            Tunnel Encaps Attribute (23)
               Tunnel Type: SR Policy
                   Binding SID
                   Preference
                   Priority
                   Policy Name
                   Explicit NULL Label Policy (ENLP)
                   IFIT Attributes
                   Segment List
                       Weight
                       Segment
                       Segment
                       ...
                   ...

   IFIT attributes can be attached at the candidate path level as sub-
   TLVs.  There may be different IFIT tools.  The following sections
   will describe the requirement and usage of different IFIT tools, and
   define the corresponding sub-TLV encoding in BGP.

   Note that the IFIT attributes here described can also be generalized
   and included as sub-TLVs for other SAFIs and NLRIs.

4.  SR Policy for IOAM

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] records operational and telemetry
   information in the packet while the packet traverses a path between
   two points in the network.  In terms of the classification given in
   RFC 7799 [RFC7799] IOAM could be categorized as Hybrid Type 1.  IOAM
   mechanisms can be leveraged where active OAM do not apply or do not
   offer the desired results.

   When SR policy enables the IOAM, the IOAM header will be inserted
   into every packet of the traffic that is steered into the SR paths.

   This document aims to define the control plane.  While a relevant
   document for the data plane is [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options] for
   Segment Routing over IPv6 data plane (SRv6).

4.1.  IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Option Sub-TLV

   The IOAM tracing data is expected to be collected at every node that
   a packet traverses to ensure visibility into the entire path a packet
   takes within an IOAM domain.  The preallocated tracing option will
   create pre-allocated space for each node to populate its information.

   The format of IOAM pre-allocated trace option sub-TLV is defined as
   follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

4.2.  IOAM Incremental Trace Option Sub-TLV

   The incremental tracing option contains a variable node data fields
   where each node allocates and pushes its node data immediately
   following the option header.

   The format of IOAM incremental trace option sub-TLV is defined as
   follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

5.  SR Policy for Enhanced Alternate Marking

   The Alternate Marking [RFC8321]technique is an hybrid performance
   measurement method, per RFC 7799 [RFC7799] classification of
   measurement methods.  Because this method is based on marking
   consecutive batches of packets.  It can be used to measure packet
   loss, latency, and jitter on live traffic.

   This document aims to define the control plane.  While a relevant
   document for the data plane is [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark] for
   Segment Routing over IPv6 data plane (SRv6).

   The format of Enhanced Alternate Marking (EAM) sub-TLV is defined as
   follows:

7.  Security Considerations

   The security mechanisms of the base BGP security model apply to the
   extensions described in this document as well.  See the Security
   Considerations section of [I-D.ietf-idr-segment-routing-te-policy].

   SR operates within a trusted SR domain RFC 8402 [RFC8402] and its
   security considerations also apply to BGP sessions when carrying SR
   Policy information.  The isolation of BGP SR Policy SAFI peering
   sessions may be used to ensure that the SR Policy information is not
   advertised outside the SR domain.  Additionally, only trusted nodes
   (that include both routers and controller applications) within the SR
   domain must be configured to receive such information.

   Implementation of IFIT methods (IOAM and Alternate Marking) are
   mindful of security and privacy concerns, as explained in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] and RFC 8321 [RFC8321].  Anyway incorrect
   IFIT parameters in the BGP extension SHOULD not have an adverse
   effect on the SR Policy as well as on the network, since it affects
   only the operation of the telemetry methodology.
