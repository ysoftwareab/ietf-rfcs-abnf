              DHCPv6 Options for Discovery NAT64 Prefixes
              draft-li-intarea-nat64-prefix-dhcp-option-02

Abstract

   Several IPv6 transition mechanisms require the usage of stateless or
   stateful translators (commonly named as NAT64) able to allow IP/ICMP
   communication between IPv4 and IPv6 networks.

   Those translators are using either a default Well-Known Prefix (WKP),
   and/or one or several additional Network Specific Prefixes (NSP),
   which need to be configured into the nodes willing to use the
   translator.  Different translators will likely have different IPv6
   prefixes, to attract traffic to the correct translator.  Thus, an
   automatic translator prefix discovery method is necessary.

   This document defines a DHCPv6-based method to inform DHCPv6 clients
   the set of IPv6 and IPv4 prefixes it serves.  This DHCPv6 option can
   be used by several transition mechanisms such as SIIT, 464XLAT, EAM.

1.  Introduction

   Stateless IP/ICMP Translation (SIIT) [RFC7915], describes the basic
   translation mechanism (NAT64), which is actually used as the base for
   many of the related translation protocols.

   Stateful NAT64 [RFC6146], describes a stateful IPv6 to IPv4
   translation mechanism, which allows IPv6-only hosts to communicate
   with IPv4-only servers using unicast UDP, TCP, or ICMP, by means of
   IPv4 public addresses sharing, among multiple IPv6-only hosts.
   Unless otherwise stated, references in the rest of this document to
   NAT64 (function) should be interpreted as to Stateful NAT64.

   The translation of the packet headers is done using the IP/ICMP
   translation algorithm defined in [RFC7915] and algorithmically
   translating the IPv4 addresses to IPv6 addresses and vice versa,

   following [RFC6052].

   464XLAT [RFC6877] describes an architecture that provides IPv4
   connectivity across a network, or part of it, when it is only
   natively transporting IPv6.  [RFC7849] already suggest the need to
   support the CLAT function in order to ensure the IPv4 service
   continuity in IPv6-only cellular deployments.  The 464XLAT
   architecture uses IPv4/IPv6 translation, described in [RFC6144], and
   standardized in [RFC6052], [RFC7915], and [RFC6146].  In the 464XLAT
   architecture, the CLAT (customer-side NAT46 translator) must
   determine which among potentially several PLAT (provider-side NAT64
   translator) IPv6 prefixes to use in order to send a packet to the
   PLAT that provides the connectivity to its destination.

   [RFC7050] describes a mechanism to learn the PLAT-side IPv6 prefix
   for protocol translation by DNS64 [RFC6147].  Although it supports
   multiple PLAT-side prefix by responding with multiple AAAA records to
   a DNS64 query, it does not support mapping IPv4 prefixes to IPv6
   prefix, which would be required, for example, if one PLAT has
   connectivity to the general Internet following a default route,
   another has connectivity to a BGP peer, and a third has connectivity
   to a network using private addressing [RFC1918].  Therefore, in the
   scenario with multiple PLATs, [RFC7050] does not directly support
   destination-based IPv4 routing among PLATs; instead, the DNS64
   database must contain equivalent information.  It also requires the
   additional deployment of DNS64 service in customer-side networks,
   which is not required in 464XLAT deployment.  Indeed, this scenario,
   which may become very common in wired access networks, has not even
   been considered by [RFC7051].

   464XLAT is in fact, a very frequent usage case of Stateful NAT64 and
   actually the predominant one in cellular networks.  As indicated in
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-nat64-deployment], it is expected that in some
   scenarios, DNS64 is not used, so mandating the use of [RFC7050] in
   those cases it is not a sensible approach.

   Explicit Address Mappings for Stateless IP/ICMP Translation [RFC7757]
   extends SIIT with an Explicit Address Mapping (EAM) algorithm to
   facilitate stateless IP/ICMP translation between arbitrary (non-
   IPv4-translatable) IPv6 endpoints and IPv4.

   Furthermore, [I-D.ietf-v6ops-nat64-deployment] and
   [I-D.ietf-v6ops-transition-ipv4aas] show that there is an increasing
   demand for deployment of NAT64/464XLAT in broadband networks, which
   may use PCP [RFC7225], to learn the NAT64 prefixes, however is not
   widely deployed.  Instead, DHCPv6/DHCPv6-PD [RFC8415] is the
   predominant provisioning protocol for broadband CEs (Customer Edge
   Routers).

Internet-Draft      NAT64 Prefix Discovery by DHCPv6          April 2019


   DHPCv6/DHCPv6-PD is also supported in 3GPP specifications for
   cellular networks ([RFC6459], [RFC7066], [RFC7849]), even if today is
   not predominant, but it is expected that the deployment of cellular
   broadband services will use it, as it is the only standard way to
   provide shorter prefixes to CEs through the cellular interphase.

   Finally, even if [RFC7051] discarded DHCPv6 as one of the interesting
   choices for learning the NAT64 prefix, the deployment considerations
   have evolved, and in fact there is a new Router Advertising option
   ([I-D.ietf-6man-ra-pref64]), which provides an alternative in some
   cases, which is complementary to the one suggested by this document.

   Consequently, this document proposes a method for the discovery of
   the NAT64 prefix, based on DHCPv6, which is widely deployed and
   supported in customer networks.  It defines two new DHCPv6 options
   for use by a DHCPv6 client to discover the NAT64 IPv6 prefix(es).
   Also, the proposed mechanism can deal with the scenario with multiple
   independent DNS64 databases supporting separate translators.

3.1.  NAT64 Prefix List Option Format

   The NAT Prefix List Option is a container for NAT64 Prefix Option(s).
   A NAT64 Prefix List Option MAY contain multiple NAT64 Prefix Options.

   The format of the NAT64 Prefix List Option is:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   o  option-code: OPTION_NAT64_PREFIX_LIST (TBA1)

   o  option-length: length of NAT64_PREFIX-options, specified in
      octets.

   o  NAT64_PREFIX-options: one or more OPTION_NAT64_PREFIX options.

3.2.  NAT64 Prefix Option Format

   The NAT64 Prefix Option is encapsulated in the NAT64 Prefix List
   Option.  This option allows the mapping of destination IPv4 address
   ranges (contained in the IPv4 Prefix List) to a NAT64 IPv6 prefix.
   If there is more than one such prefix, each prefix comes in its own
   option, with its associated IPv4 prefix list.  In this way, the
   DHCPv6 client can select the NAT64 with the corresponding destination
   IPv4 address.

   The format of the NAT64 Prefix Option is:

    0                   1                   2                   3

      which a length of 96 bits (/96).

   o  IPv4 Prefix List: This is an optional field.  The format of the
      IPv4 Prefix List is shown in Figure 3.  It is a list of zero or
      more IPv4 Prefixes.  Each entry is formed by IPv4-prelen and IPv4
      Prefix.  The total length of the field is 5*number of IPv4
      prefixes.

   o  IPv4-prelen: the length of the IPv4 Prefix.

   o  IPv4 Prefix: the destination-based IPv4 Prefix.  The length is 4
      octets.

4.  Client Behavior

   The client requests the OPTION_NAT64_PREFIX_LIST option using the
   Option Request option (ORO) in every Solicit, Request, Renew, Rebind,
   and Information-request message.  The NAT64-Type field defines the
   mechanism being used.  If the DHCPv6 server includes the

   OPTION_NAT64_PREFIX_LIST option in its response, the DHCPv6 client
   may use the contained NAT64-prefix to translate the destination IPv4
   address into the destination IPv6 address.

   When receiving the OPTION_NAT64_PREFIX option with IPv4 Prefix List,
   the DHCPv6 client MUST record the received IPv6 prefix and the
   corresponding IPv4 prefixes in IPv4 Prefix List.  When receiving the
   OPTION_NAT64_PREFIX option without IPv4 Prefix List, the DHCPv6
   client MUST treat the IPv6 prefix and the default IPv4 prefix
   0.0.0.0/0 as one of the records.

   If the DHCPv6 client loses contact with the DHCPv6 server, the DHCPv6
   client SHOULD clear the prefix(es) it learned from the DHCPv6 server.

   When translating the destination IPv4 address into the destination
   IPv6 address, DHCPv6 client MUST search an IPv4 routing database
   using the longest-match-first rule and select the IPv6 prefix
   offering that IPv4 prefix.

5.  Message Flow Illustration

   The figure below shows an example of message flow for a Client
   learning IPv6 prefixes using DHCPv6.

   In this example, two IPv6 prefixes are provided by the DHCPv6 server.
   The first IPv6 prefix is 2001:db8:122:300::/56, the corresponding
   IPv4 prefixes are 192.0.2.0/24 and 198.51.100.0/24.  The second IPv6
   prefix is 2001:db8:122::/48, the corresponding IPv4 prefix is
   192.0.2.128/25.

   When the DHCPv6 client receives the packet with destination IPv4
   address 192.0.2.1, according to the rule of longest prefix match, the
   NAT64 with IPv6 prefix 2001:db8:122::/48 is chosen.  In the same way,
   the NAT64 with IPv6 prefix 2001:db8:122::/48 is chosen.

6.  Security Considerations

   Considerations for security in this type of environment are primarily
   around the operation of the DHCPv6 protocol and the databases it
   uses.

   In the DHCPv6 server, should the database be compromised, it will
   deliver incorrect data to its DHCPv6 clients.  In the DHCPv6 client,

   should its database be compromised by attack or polluted by an
   incorrect DHCPv6 server database, it will route data incorrectly.  In
   both cases, the security of the systems and their databases in an
   operational matter, not managed by protocol.

   However, the operation of the DHCPv6 protocol itself is also required
   to be correct - the server and its clients must recognize valid
   requests and reject invalid ones.  Therefore, DHCPv6 exchanges MUST
   be secured as described in [RFC8415].

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should allocate two DHCPv6 option codes for use by
   OPTION_V6_PLATPREFIX_LIST and OPTION_V6_PLATPREFIX from the "Option
   Codes" table.  Similarly, a request to IANA for assigning the
   NAT64-Type field codes.  The following initial values are assigned in
   this document (values are 16-bit unsigned intergers).

                         Name       |  Value  |   RFC
