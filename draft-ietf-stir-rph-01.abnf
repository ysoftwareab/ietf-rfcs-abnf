   A SIP authentication service typically will derive the value of "rph"
   from the 'Resource-Priority' header field based on policy associated
   with service specific use of the "namespace "." r-priority" values
   based on [RFC4412].  The authentication service derives the value of
   the PASSPorT claim by verifying the authorization for Resource-
   Priority (i.e., verifying a calling user privilege for Resource-
   Priority based on its identity) which might be derived from customer
   profile data or from access to external services.

   [RFC4412] allows multiple "namespace "." r-priority" pairs, either in
   a single SIP Resource-Priority header or across multiple SIP
   Resource-Priority headers.  However, it is not necessary to sign all
   content of a SIP Resource-Priority header or all SIP Resource-
   Priority headers in a given SIP message.  An authority is only
   responsible for signing the content of a SIP Resource-Priority header
   for which it has authority (e.g., a specific "namespace "."
   r-priority").
