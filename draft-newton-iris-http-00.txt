1. Introduction and Motivations

   The proposal in this document describes an IRIS[12] application
   transport binding using HTTP[6]. Requirements for IRIS and the
   specification in this document are outlined in [13].

   The choice of HTTP as the transport substrate is primarily driven by
   the need to re-use an existing, well-understood protocol with all
   the necessary features to support the requirements. This gives
   implementers a wealth of toolkits and debugging gear for use in
   constructing both servers and clients and allows operators to apply
   existing experience in issues of deployment. It is also felt that
   the construction of a simple application transport for the specific
   purpose of IRIS would yield a similar, though likely smaller,
   standard after taking into consideration such matters as framing,
   authentication, etc.

   It is not the intent of this document to specify HTTP for such
   usages as by-passing fire-walls, co-mingling URI schemes, or any
   other such methods which might lead to confusion between an IRIS
   application and traditional World Wide Web applications using HTTP.
   The proposal in this document intends to adhere to the best common
   practices spelled out in RFC3205[8].

   Finally, precedents for using other transport mechanisms in layered
   applications do not seem to fit with the design goals of IRIS.
   BEEP[3], while a very complete application transport, offers many
   more features than would otherwise be used in the normal and
   expected uses of this application. Examples of such features are
   multiplexing connection behavior and peer-to-peer session
   negotiation. Conversely, the straight use of TCP such as that
   specified by [14] does not offer the client negotiation
   characteristics needed by a referral application where a single
   client, in the act of processing a query, may traverse multiple
   servers operating with different parameters.

2. Document Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119[11].

3. URI Definition

   An IRIS URI[16] has the following general syntax.

   iris://<server>/<registry-namespace>/<entity-name>

   The full ABNF[17] with certain values included from RFC2396[16]
   follows.

   iris-uri           = "iris://" server "/" registry-name "/" entity-name
   server             = // as specified by RFC2396
   registry-namespace = // as specified by IRIS
   entity-name        = *(unreserved | escaped)
   reserved           = // as specified by RFC2396
   escaped            = "%" hex hex
   hex                = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" |
                        "7" | "8" | "9" | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" |
                        "E" | "F" | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" |
                        "f"

   According to the rules in IRIS[12], there is no such thing as a
   relative URI for this scheme. In addition, valid URI's with this
   scheme MUST always contain a registry name (namespace identifier)
   and an entity name. In addition, the entity name MUST be encoded
   using the UTF-8[18] encoding scheme. Any octet that does not meet
   the qualification as an unreserved character according to
   RFC2396[16] MUST be represented by a "%" followed by two characters
   from the <hex> character set above. The two characters give the
   hexadecimal representation of that octet.

4. Use of HTTP

4.1 Message Passing

   The use of the HTTP transport is straight forward. The client
   connects to an IRIS[12] server and issues a request using the POST
   method to the "/" path with the Content-Type and Accept header set
   to "application/xml". The content of the POST body is the IRIS
   XML[2] instance to be parsed by the server.

   The results are sent back to the client with a Content-Type of
   "application/xml". The body of the result is the IRIS XML instance
   to be parsed by the client. If a client sends an IRIS <quit>
   command, the request MUST also be accompanied by the appropriate
   Connection header using the "close" connection-token as specified by
   HTTP/1.1[6]. If the XML instance contains no other request commands,
   the server MUST return a 204 "No Content" message before closing the
   connection. If the XML instance contains other request commands, the
   server MUST return a valid XML instance.

4.2 HTTP Features

   Though pipelining is allowed and specified by HTTP/1.1[6], the IRIS
   binding to HTTP restricts the use of the feature. Clients MAY NOT
   pipeline requests.

   IRIS allows authentication by means of the application transport.
   Clients MAY employee the authentication procedures specified in
   RFC2617[7] for basic and digest authentication using HTTP. In
   addition, the use of TLS[5] for both client and server
   authentication and session encryption MAY be used via an Upgrade
   header as specified by RFC2817[4]. Tunneling methods such as those
   specified by RFC2818[15] MAY NOT be used.

4.3 Versioning

   Clients SHOULD inquire as to the supported version of IRIS and
   SHOULD make this inquiry before issuing any IRIS queries. To do
   this, the client issues a request using the GET method to the
   "/versions" path with the Accept header set to "application/xml".

   The server MUST respond with an XML instance according to the
   following DTD.

   <!ELEMENT versionNamespaces (namespaceUri+)>

   <!ELEMENT namespaceUri (#PCDATA)>

   The contents of the <namespaceUri> element MUST be a URI[16]

   specifying the XML namespace of an XML Schema according to [1].

   If a client requests an IRIS version, according to the rules above,
   for which a server cannot produce responses (i.e. doesn't support
   that version of IRIS), the server MUST return a 501 "Not
   Implemented" response.

5. Internationalization Considerations

   URI's are not considered to be internationalized. The topic of
   internationalized URI's is beyond the scope of this document and is
   not specific to the IRIS URI scheme defined here. It is an issue to
   be addressed by a larger scope.

   The entity name component of an IRIS URI is specified using UTF-8.
   This has been done for interoperability purposes.

6. IANA Considerations

   The IANA will need to be asked to register the IRIS URI scheme. The
   IANA will need to assign a standard port number to IRIS over HTTP.
   It MUST NOT be the same port numbers for the URI schemes http (80)
   or https (443).

7. Security Considerations

   This document introduces no known security concerns. However,
   implementers should be fully aware of the security considerations
   given by IRIS[12], HTTP/1.1[6], HTTP Basic and Digest
   Authentication[7], and Upgrading To TLS with HTTP[4]. In addition,
   deference should be given to the security concerns outlined in
   RFC3205[8].
