<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>RFC 4474 defines a mechanism for secure identification
            of callers in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This
            mechanism has been used as the foundation for some recent
            additional work, including connected party
            identification, anti-spam, and secure media. However,
            concerns have been raised about the applicability of RFC
            4474 in real deployments and the actual level of security
            services it provides. This document describes those
            concerns.

<a name="rfc.section.1"></a><h3>1.&nbsp;
Introduction</h3>

<p>
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <a class='info' href='#RFC3261'>[RFC3261]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., Schulzrinne, H., Camarillo, G., Johnston, A., Peterson, J., Sparks, R., Handley, M., and E. Schooler, &ldquo;SIP: Session Initiation Protocol,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> defined
a simple mechanism for conveying the identity of the caller - a basic
From field which was inserted by the calling UA. This mechanism has
all of the security pitfalls of the From header field in email.

</p>
<p>
A short term solution was standardized in <a class='info' href='#RFC3325'>[RFC3325]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jennings, C., Peterson, J., and M. Watson, &ldquo;Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserted Identity within Trusted Networks,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>,
which provides a network asserted identity. This mechanism is better
than a basic From field, but works only in closed user groups and
communities that have mutual trust. A longer term solution was
developed, generally called SIP Identity, and published in
<a class='info' href='#RFC4474'>[RFC4474]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Peterson, J. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;Enhancements for Authenticated Identity Management in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. SIP Identity makes use of domain-based
signatures to provide security. An originating proxy authenticates the
user, verifies that it matches their identity in the From header
field, and if so, includes an Identity header field. This header field
contains a cryptographic signature over the From header field along
with other parts of the message, and is then signed by the originating
domain. A recipient that receives the request can verify the
signature, and compare the domain name in the signers certificate with
the domain name in the From header field. If they match, the recipient
knows that the originating domain has vouched for the identity of the
caller. 

</p>
<p>
The SIP Identity mechanism improves upon RFC 3325 by allowing it to
work across several transit networks. There is no requirement of
mutual trust along every hop; the terminating domain or user directly
verifies the assertion made by the calling domain.

</p>
<p>
SIP Identity has been identified as a core SIP protocol
<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sip-hitchhikers-guide'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sip&#8209;hitchhikers&#8209;guide]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J., &ldquo;A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. It has been used as
the basis for connected identity, which delivers the identity of the
called party <a class='info' href='#RFC4916'>[RFC4916]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Elwell, J., &ldquo;Connected Identity in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),&rdquo; June&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. More recently, SIP Identity is
used to provide the integrity services needed to secure DTLS-SRTP
<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-avt-dtls-srtp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;avt&#8209;dtls&#8209;srtp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>McGrew, D. and E. Rescorla, &ldquo;Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Extension to Establish Keys for Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. In essence, it is becoming a
core part of the SIP security story.

</p>
<p>
However, recently concerns have been raised about the applicability of
SIP Identity, especially in the presence of phone numbers. This
document explores those concerns.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
The Problem with Numbers</h3>

<p>
The mechanism in RFC 4474 is intimately intertwined with the domain
part of the From URI. On the receiving side, the identity is
considered verified when two conditions exist:

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>The signature placed in the Identity header field matches the
  signature computed by the verifier, and

</li>
<li>the domain owner, as identified in the
signing certificate, matches the domain part of the From header field

</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these properties are needed to provide the security that
SIP Identity provides. Unfortunately, in reality, most SIP deployments
  at the time of writing make use of phone numbers, and not traditional
  email-style user@domain identifiers. Of course, a phone number does not
  have a domain part. How, then, can RFC 4474 be used? The
  specification itself has this to say on the subject:

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>

     11.  Identity and the TEL URI Scheme

        Since many SIP applications provide a Voice over IP (VoIP) service,
        telephone numbers are commonly used as identities in SIP deployments.
        In the majority of cases, this is not problematic for the identity
        mechanism described in this document.  Telephone numbers commonly
        appear in the username portion of a SIP URI (e.g.,
        'sip:+17005551008@chicago.example.com;user=phone').  That username
        conforms to the syntax of the TEL URI scheme (RFC 3966 [13]).  For
        this sort of SIP address-of-record, chicago.example.com is the
        appropriate signatory.

        It is also possible for a TEL URI to appear in the SIP To or From
        header field outside the context of a SIP or SIPS URI (e.g.,
        'tel:+17005551008').  In this case, it is much less clear which
        signatory is appropriate for the identity.  Fortunately for the
        identity mechanism, this form of the TEL URI is more common for the
        To header field and Request-URI in SIP than in the From header field,
        since the UAC has no option but to provide a TEL URI alone when the
        remote domain to which a request is sent is unknown.  The local
        domain, however, is usually known by the UAC, and accordingly it can
        form a proper From header field containing a SIP URI with a username
        in TEL URI form.  Implementations that intend to send their requests
        through an authentication service SHOULD put telephone numbers in the
        From header field into SIP or SIPS URIs whenever possible.

</pre></div>
<p>
This text makes it sound like there really isn't much of a problem;
that the originator merely needs to use the SIP version of his SIP
URI, and then there will be no problem. However, the usage of phone
numbers in this way is problematic. The presence of the domain part in
the URI is artificial; as an identifier for a user, the domain part is
not relevant. 

</p>
<p>
When phone numbers are used, users only know the association
between the phone number itself and a user. That is, Bob knows that
"+1 (973) 865-4321" corresponds to Alice. The domain part is not
relevant to him. Bob doesn't use the domain part to reach Alice; he
just dials the number. Bob might look up Alice in his phone book, but
he'll only see the number there. Bob will use that number when dialing Alice
from his cell phone or non-VoIP equipment, and not even have the
opportunity to provide a domain name. Alice, in turn, gives out
only her number, without the trailing domain part. Almost all user
equipment today that provides a form of caller ID, will NOT render the
domain part of the URI if the user part is a phone number. Indeed, its very
likely that Bob doesn't even know that Alice gets service from
a.com. Most users don't know the providers of the other people they
interact with. Local number portability has made that association even
more ephemeral. Users move between providers relatively easily now,
keeping the same number, even though the domain part effectively
changes. 

</p>
<p>
Consequently, the domain part of the SIP URI, when used in conjunction
with phone numbers, is not relevant to users in establishing the
identity associated with that number. For email-style identifiers,
this is not true - the domain part is highly relevant.

</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this problem is a FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY OF PHONE
NUMBERS. No specifications or efforts on the part of IETF can fix this
problem. Phone numbers are fundamentally NOT scoped to a domain, and
attempts to represent them in any other form are ultimately futile
from an identification perspective.

Alice, who gets VoIP service from a.com, has a phone number of +1
(973) 865-4321, and sends an INVITE to Bob. Alice has no user@domain
form of AoR; a.com is providing strictly voice services. Per the instructions
in RFC 4474, Alice populates the From header field of her INVITE as
sip:+19738654321@a.com;user=phone. The a.com proxy as as
the authentication service as defined in RFC 4474, and adds an
Identity header field. It uses a certificate, signed by a root CA,
asserting that it is a.com. This INVITE passes to b.com. The proxy at
b.com, for purposes of malice or otherwise, does the following:

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Removes the Identity and Identity-Info header fields
</li>
<li>Modifies the From header field to
  sip:+19738654321@b.com;user=phone. In other words, it replaces the
  domain part with its own domain name.
</li>
<li>Adds a new Identity and Identity-Info header field, containing its
  own signature, performed using a certificate it holds for the b.com
  domain. 
</li>
<li>Forwards the request to the target in c.com.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This request arrives at c.com, and the request is passed to Bob. Bob's
agent runs the verification process
described in RFC 4474. The signature on the request is valid, and the
domain in the From header field matches the domain in the certificate
of the signer. Bob's UA shows the identity of the caller as "+1 (973)
865-4321" and indicates that the identity has been verified. This
number does in fact match the number of the caller, Alice. And so, as
far as Bob is concerned, everything seems fine. However, b.com has
been able to insert itself, and do whatever it wants.

</p>
<p>
What happened here? It is illustrative to look at this attack in the
case where Alice had used a user@domain identifier, for example,
alice@a.com. In this case, if the b.com transit domain had done the
same processing described above, the request would have arrived to Bob's
user agent. The signature would be valid, and the domain of the signer
would match the domain in the From field. However, the identity shown
to Bob would be "alice@b.com", which doesn't match Alice's AOR as far
as Bob knows. Consequently, Bob will be alerted to the fact that
something is going on.

</p>
<p>
Its important to note that, even with email-style identifiers, the
re-sign attack might not be noticed by Bob. If Bob doesn't know Alice;
he has no way to know that the caller isn't actually
alice@b.com. Consequently, the attack would succeed in that case as
well. Indeed, this weakness is outlined in RFC 4474 itself. From
Section 13.1:

</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>


     In the end analysis, the Identity and Identity-Info headers cannot
     protect themselves.  Any attacker could remove these headers from a
     SIP request, and modify the request arbitrarily afterwards.  However,
     this mechanism is not intended to protect requests from men-in-the-
     middle who interfere with SIP messages; it is intended only to
     provide a way that SIP users can prove definitively that they are who
     they claim to be.
</pre></div>
<p>
However, these man-in-the-middle attacks (when an email-style From URI
is being used) will be detectable for cases
where the called party knows the caller. Even when the called party
doesn't know the caller, attemptes to return their calls would fail, and 
future discussions and communications with the caller would probably
quickly reveal that the wrong identifier had been delivered. 

</p>
<p>
Our conclusion is that, when email-style identifiers are used, RFC
4474 provides a reasonable degree of protection against re-signing
and, in fact, provides a reasonable degree of message integrity over
the parts of the message covered by the Identity signature. However,
when phone numbers are used, RFC 4474 provides no protection against
re-signing, and its message integrity is easily subject to MITM
attacks.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
The False Number Attack</h3>

<p>
Consider once more the topology of
<a class='info' href='#fig-transit'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Transit Configuration</span><span>)</span></a>. However, in this discussion, Alice is a
malicious user, and their provider a.com is also malicious. Alice
wishes to make a call to Bob, but wishes to lie about her phone number
in an attempt to mislead Bob as to the identity of the
caller. Consequently, even though Alice's actual phone number is +1
(973) 865-4321, she would like to initiate a call and claim to have
the number +1 (202) 456-1414, which is the United States White House
switchboard number.

</p>
<p>
Alice sends her INVITE with a From header field of
sip:+12024561414@a.com;user=phone. Her proxy at a.com, which is an
accomplice in this fabrication, signs the request anyway and includes
a pointer to its perfectly valid certificate into the Identity-Info
header field. The b.com domain is a large provider and doesn't have
the resources to check up on the behavior of its transit partners. So,
it passes the INVITE on to Bob's domain, c.com.

</p>
<p>
This call is then passed to Bob. Since this is a perfectly valid From
header field value, and the Identity signatures and certificates are
all valid, Bob accepts the request. His user agent, noticing that this
is a phone number, renders just the phone number, which Bob recognizes
as the White House switchboard number. He then answers the call.

</p>
<p>
The reason this attack is possible is that, for phone numbers, only
the user part, and NOT the domain part, are relevant for
identification. Furthermore, there is nothing within the scope of RFC
4474 which allows a recipient of a request to determine that a
particular domain is, in fact, a legitimate owner of a particular
phone number. Indeed, the very notion of ownership is a complex
one. Thus, it is possible for a domain to claim a particular phone
number in its user part, even if that phone number is not in fact
'owned' by that domain. The only protection offered against this attack is
the trustworthiness of the domain itself. A domain cannot lie about
who they are, but they can lie about what numbers they own. Thus, if a
user trusts that a particular domain won't lie, they can determine
that a call is from that domain, and therefore trust the phone number
only due to their belief in the truthfulness of that domain.

Consequences</h3>

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
Unsecure Caller ID for Phone Numbers</h3>

<p>
The false number attack described in <a class='info' href='#sec-false'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>The False Number Attack</span><span>)</span></a> means
that RFC 4474 does not readily provide 'secure caller ID' for phone
numbers. The definition of secure in this context is that the phone
number present in the From header field URI does in fact represent the
number of the party that originated the call. 

</p>
<p>
The term 'readily' above is important. As noted in
<a class='info' href='#sec-false'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>The False Number Attack</span><span>)</span></a>, the asserted calling number can be
considered valid if the signing domain is trusted by the called UA. As a
general rule, a UA will not have an easy way to ascertain the
trustworthiness of any particular domain. A UA might, perhaps, be
configured with the domains of providers it does trust. For example, a
UA might trust the large service providers in its country (generally a
small and enumerable set), and so it could have 'secure' caller ID
only for calls from those providers. 

</p>
<p>
If a UA is only willing to trust its own provider, this would likely
result in a model whereby each provider determines the trustworthiness
of the previous provider, and for those it trusts, it modifies the
From header field URI and resigns the request. Such an approach would
introduce a transitive trust model to possibly alleviate this problem.

</p>

<a name="rfc.section.4.2"></a><h3>4.2.&nbsp;
Comparison with RFC3325</h3>

<p>
A critical question to be answered, then, is whether RFC 4474 provides
any additional security properties above RFC 3325.

</p>
<p>
Firstly, it is clearly the case that for email-style identifiers, RFC
4474 is far superior to RFC 3325. RFC 3325 allows the false number
attack even for those identifiers. A malicious originating domain
could assert a caller identity of sip:george@whitehouse.gov, and this
would be the identity rendered to a called party. RFC 3325 provides an
overall level of secure caller ID equal to the trustworthiness of the
LEAST trustworthy domain in the network. As the size of a network
grows, this level of trustworthiness approaches zero. This is not true
in RFC 4474; an attacker could not assert identity within
whitehouse.gov.

</p>
<p>
Considering phone numbers, two cases must be considered. In one model,
each domain in a chain of domains resigns the request and changes the
domain name to point to itself. This is possible because the re-sign
attack. In this case, it is not because a domain is being malicious;
but rather, because it will only choose to re-sign if it trusts its
upstream domain. This allows a UA to be configured with a single
domain to trust - its own provider - and obtain transitive trust
overall. This model is, for all intents and purposes, identical to the
trust model outlined for RFC 3325. Consequently, RFC 4474 is no better
than RFC 3325 here.

</p>
<p>
However, in the second model, intermediate domains do not resign
requests. Furthermore, UA's utilize white lists and black lists of
domains that are known to be trustworthy (or not). Today, such lists
do exist and are provided for email spam. One can imagine a UA
contacting such a service periodically, or upon an incoming call, to
verify the signing domain against the list. 

</p>
<p>
In this model, RFC 4474 is still superior to RFC3325. In RFC3325, the
trustworthiness of the caller ID is as trustable as the least
trustworthy domain. As noted above, this approaches zero - for all
calls - once the network reaches a reasonable size. However, in RFC
4474, the trustworthiness of the caller ID is as trustable as the
domain from which the call came. Of course, calls may still arrive
from untrusted domains, but in the case of RFC 4474, a UA will know
that. As such, it is possible for a UA to separate out caller ID from
domains it does trust from those it doesn't, and if it can obtain
sufficient coverage from its whitelists so that many incoming caller
IDs are trusted, the system works better. That, however, is the
key. If the whitelists accessible by a UA cover only 3% of the total
number of allocated numbers, most incoming calls will not have a
trustable caller ID, and the system will be just as bad as RFC 3325.

</p>
<p>
If history is any guide, it is my belief that domains are likely to
follow the first model, and not the second. 

</p>
<p>
Consequently, the conclusion is that RFC 4474 may provide somewhat
more trustable caller ID for phone numbers than RFC 3325, but in
practice they are likely to be identical. However, for email-style
identifiers, RFC 4474 is superior.

<a name="rfc.section.4.3"></a><h3>4.3.&nbsp;
Interactions with DTLS-SRTP</h3>

<p>
When used with email identifiers, RFC 4474 provides a limited form of
message integrity protection against MITM attacks. As discussed above,
this is because modified domains in From fields are likely to be
readily detected by end users, either right away or in the
future. However, with phone numbers, RFC 4474 provides no message
integrity against MITM attacks. 

</p>
<p>
This weakness interacts with DTLS-SRTP
<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-avt-dtls-srtp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;avt&#8209;dtls&#8209;srtp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>McGrew, D. and E. Rescorla, &ldquo;Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Extension to Establish Keys for Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP),&rdquo; February&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. In particular,
<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sip&#8209;dtls&#8209;srtp&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fischl, J., Tschofenig, H., and E. Rescorla, &ldquo;Framework for Establishing an SRTP Security Context using DTLS,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> describes how the
DTLS handshakes are correlated with the signaling exchange by means of
the message integrity mechanisms provided by RFC 4474. However, when
the calling party has a phone number, that message integrity is lost. 

</p>
<p>
A consequence of this is that any intermediate signaling entity could
modify the DTLS fingerprints, insert itself as a media intermediary,
and then decrypt and re-encrypt media on each side. Such an attack
would not be detectable if the caller has a phone number. Indeed, it
won't be detectable even if they have an email-style identifier, if
the called party doesn't recognize that the caller's identity doesn't
match what their UA is showing to them.

</p>
<p>
This, in turn, raises an important question - does, in fact, DTLS-SRTP
provide "more secure" media than Sdescriptions
<a class='info' href='#RFC4568'>[RFC4568]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Andreasen, F., Baugher, M., and D. Wing, &ldquo;Session Description Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions for Media Streams,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>? One of the key weaknesses of Sdescriptions
is that, assuming each hop is TLS, the keying material is still
exposed to each and every intermediate proxy. This means that any
intermediary could intercept and process the media. When used with
phone numbers, DTLS-SRTP has this same weakness.

</p>
<p>
That said, DTLS-SRTP does provide some advantages even when used with
phone numbers:

</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>To protect against eavesdropping attacks from off-path attackers,
  Sdescriptions requires that each and every hop has properly
  encrypted the link with TLS (this is ignoring the possibility of
  end-to-end SMIME encryption). Thus, simple misconfiguration of an
  intermediary can expose Sdescriptions to attacks by offpath
  attackers. DTLS-SRTP does not rely on confidentiality services from
  intermediaries; indeed it relies on nothing special from them,
  except that they aren't being malicious. Thus, DTLS-SRTP provides
  better protection against offpath attacks.

</li>
<li>With Sdescriptions, because the keying material is in the
  signaling, intermediaries will see it directly even when each
  signaling hop is encrypted. Consequently, it is possible that this
  material could 'leak' out unsecured channels, such as logs an
  application interfaces. This would allow other entities access to
  the keying material and thus allow them to manipulate the media
  stream. With DTLS-SRTP, this is possible only by active attack by
  such applications. Thus, DTLS-SRTP provides mildly better protection
  here. 

</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thus, DTLS-SRTP still provides better security than
Sdescriptions. However, when used with phone numbers, it is by no
means ideal. Most importantly, it does NOT provide guarantees that
intermediaries have not been able to intercept and decrypt the
media.

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;
Conclusions</h3>

<p>
Unfortunately, there is no simple remedy to this problem. The problems
with RFC4474 cannot just be fixed by an alternate security
technique. They are deeply rooted in the domain independence of phone
numbers. 

</p>
<p>
Consequently, our recommendation at this point is to more clearly
document the limitations of RFC4474 when used with phone numbers. We
recommend that RFC4474 be revised, and that the updated document
include a more detailed discussion of the weaknesses it has when used
with phone numbers. Similarly, we recommend that
<a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-sip-dtls-srtp-framework'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;sip&#8209;dtls&#8209;srtp&#8209;framework]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Fischl, J., Tschofenig, H., and E. Rescorla, &ldquo;Framework for Establishing an SRTP Security Context using DTLS,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> be revised to
include a more thorough description of the limitations of DTLS-SRTP
when used with phone numbers.
