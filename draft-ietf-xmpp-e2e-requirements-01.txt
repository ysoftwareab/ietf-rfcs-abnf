Internet-Draft            XMPP E2E Requirements               March 2010


1.  Introduction

   End-to-end or "e2e" encryption of traffic sent over the Extensible
   Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a desirable goal.  Since
   1999, the Jabber/XMPP developer community has experimented with
   several such technologies, including OpenPGP [XMPP-PGP], S/MIME
   [XMPP-SMIME], and encrypted sessions [XMPP-SESS].  More recently, the
   community has explored the possibility of using Transport Layer
   Security [TLS] as the base technology for e2e encryption.  In order
   to provide a foundation for deciding on a sustainable approach to e2e
   encryption, this document specifies a set of requirements that the
   ideal technology would meet.

   The preferred venue for discussion of this document is the
   xmpp@ietf.org mailing list; visit
   <https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/xmpp> for further information.


2.  Scope

   There are several different forms of communication between XMPP
   entitites:

   1.  One-to-one communication sessions between two entities, where
       each entity is online and available during the life of the
       session so that all of the communications occur in real time.
   2.  One-to-one messages that are not transferred in real time but
       that instead are stored when sent and then forwarded when the
       recipient is next online; these are usually called "offline
       messages" as described in [OFFLINE].
   3.  One-to-many information broadcast, such as undirected presence
       stanzas sent from one user to many contacts as described in
       [XMPP-IM] and data syndication as described in [PubSub].
   4.  Many-to-many communication sessions among more than two entities,
       such as a text conference in a chatroom as described in [MUC].

   Ideally, any technology for end-to-end encryption in XMPP could be
   extended to cover all of the foregoing communication methods.
   However, both one-to-many broadcast and many-to-many sessions are
   deemed out-of-scope for this document, and this document puts more
   weight on one-to-one communication sessions (the typical scenario for
   XMPP) than on offline messages.


3.  Threat Analysis

   XMPP technologies are typically deployed using a client-server
   architecture.  As a result, XMPP endpoints (often but not always



Saint-Andre             Expires September 9, 2010               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            XMPP E2E Requirements               March 2010


   controlled by human users) need to communicate through one or more
   servers.  For example, the user juliet@capulet.lit connects to the
   capulet.lit server and the user romeo@montague.lit connects to the
   montague.lit server, but in order for Juliet to send a message to
   Romeo the message will be routed over her client-to-server connection
   with capulet.lit, over a server-to-server connection between
   capulet.lit and montague.lit, and over Romeo's client-to-server
   connection with montague.lit.  Although [XMPP-CORE] requires support
   for Transport Layer Security [TLS] to make it possible to encrypt all
   of these connections, when XMPP is deployed any of these connections
   might be unencrypted.  Furthermore, even if the server-to-server
   connection is encrypted and both of the client-to-server connections
   are encrypted, the message would still be in the clear while
   processed by both the capulet.lit and montague.lit servers.

   In this specification we primarily address communications security
   ("commsec") between two parties, especially confidentiality, data
   integrity, and peer entity authentication.  Communications security
   can be subject to a variety of attacks, which [RFC3552] divides into
   passive and active categories.  In a passive attack, information is
   leaked (e.g., a passive attacker could read all of the messages that
   Juliet sends to Romeo).  In an active attack, the attacker can add,
   modify, or delete messages between the parties, thus disrupting
   communications.

   Traditionally, it seems that XMPP users have been concerned more
   about passive attacks (such as eavesdropping) than about active
   attacks (such as man-in-the-middle), perhaps because they have
   thought that their communications are "just chat", because they have
   had no expectation that endpoints could be authenticated, or because
   they have believed that hijacked communications would be detected
   socially (e.g., because the other party did not have an authentic
   "voice" in a text conversation).  However, both forms of attack are
   of concern in this protocol.

   In particular, we consider the following types of attacks and
   attackers:

   o  One type of passive attack might involve monitoring all the
      conversations of a given party.  To help prevent this, it is
      important for the party to ensure that its connection with its
      server is protected using TLS.  However, in this case the
      eavesdropper could monitor outbound traffic from the party's
      server, either to other connected clients or to other servers,
      since that traffic might be unencrypted.  In addition, the
      eavesdropper could attack the party's server so that it gains
      access to all traffic within the server, or masquerade as the
      party's server so that the party is fooled into connecting to the

Internet-Draft            XMPP E2E Requirements               March 2010


      attacker rather than directly to the party's server.
   o  Another type of passive attack might involve monitoring of a
      single conversation between two particular parties.  In this case
      the eavesdropper could monitor communications over the server-to-
      server connection between the parties' servers, or over the
      client-to-server connection between either party and that party's
      server.
   o  One type of active attack would involve modification of the XML
      stanzas used to advertise support for the protocol "building
      blocks" that make it possible to negotiate a secure session; as a
      result, other parties would be led to believe that the party does
      not have the ability to negotate a secure session and therefore
      would not attempt such a negotiation.
   o  Another type of active attack would involve modification or
      outright deletion of the XML stanzas used to negotiate a secure
      session (such as those described in this document), with the
      result that the parties would think the negotiation has failed for
      legitimate reasons such as incompatibilities between the parties'
      clients.
   o  A more sophisticated active attack would involve a cryptanalytic
      attack on the keying material or other credentials used to
      establish trust between the parties, such as an ephemeral password
      exchanged during an initial certificate exchange if Secure Remote
      Password [TLS-SRP] is used.

   Other attacks are possible, and the foregoing list is best considered
   incomplete at this time.

   Although an attacker might be able to launch an attack once, it is
   possible that the attacker cannot launch an attack multiple times.
   Given that the communication pattern in XMPP is typically to hold
   multiple different conversations that are separated in time, many end
   users might consider it acceptable to engage in a "leap of faith" the
   first time two parties negotiate a secure communication session, then
   check to make sure that the credentials are the same in subsequent
   communication sessions.


4.  Security Requirements

   This document stipulates the following security requirements for end-
   to-end encryption of XMPP communications:

   Confidentiality:  The one-to-one XML stanzas exchanged between two
      entities (conventionally, "Alice" and "Bob") must not be
      understandable to any other entity that might intercept the
      communications.  The encrypted stanzas should be understood by an
      intermediate server only to the extent absolutely required to

Internet-Draft            XMPP E2E Requirements               March 2010


      route them (i.e., the 'from' and 'to' addresses).  However, note
      that some intermediaries might require or desire access to more
      detailed information in order to route XMPP stanzas (e.g., data
      about confidentiality levels or delivery semantics).
   Integrity:  Alice and Bob must be sure that no other entity can
      change the content of the XML stanzas they exchange, or remove or
      insert stanzas undetected.
   Replay Protection:  Alice or Bob must be able to identify and reject
      any communications that are copies of their previous
      communications resent by another entity.
   Perfect Forward Secrecy:  The encrypted communication should not be
      revealed even if long-lived keys are compromised in the future
      (e.g., Steve steals Bob's computer).  For long-lived sessions it
      must be possible to periodically change the decryption keys.
   Trust:  The protocol must enable Alice and Bob to establish trust in
      each other's credentials either within the protocol or using
      outside channels.  The supported credential types might include
      self-signed certificates, pre-shared keys, and shared secrets,
      either as stable credentials or as mechanisms for bootstrapping
      trust in ephemeral keying material.  The protocol must not force
      the use of any public key infrastructure (PKI), certification
      authority, web of trust, or any other trust model that is external
      to the trust established between Alice and Bob; however, if
      external authentication or trust models are available then Alice
      and Bob should be able to use such trust models to enhance any
      trust that exists between them.
   Authentication:  Each party to a conversation should be able to
      determine that the other party is who they want to communicate
      with (Alice must be able to know that Bob really is Bob, or at
      least is an entity that possesses a credential to which only Bob
      is expected to have access).  Authentication can be as simple as
      Alice confirming that Bob is the same Bob that she communicated
      with yesterday or that she talked with on the telephone (identity
      coherence across time).  The reliable association between an
      entity and its public keys is "identification" and therefore
      beyond the scope of this document.
   Identity Protection:  No entity other than the intermediate servers
      and the parties themselves should be able to identify Alice or
      Bob. Naturally, the JabberIDs they use to route their stanzas are
      unavoidably vulnerable to interception.  Therefore, even if Alice
      and Bob protect their identities by using different JabberIDs for
      each session, it must be possible for their user agents to
      authenticate them transparently, without any other entity
      identifying them via an active ("man-in-the-middle") attack, or
      even linking them to their previous sessions.  If that is not
      possible because Alice and Bob choose to authenticate using public
      keys instead of retained shared secrets, then the public keys must
      not be revealed to other entities using a passive attack.  Bob

Internet-Draft            XMPP E2E Requirements               March 2010


      should also be able to choose between protecting either his public
      key or Alice's public key from disclosure through an active
      attack.
   Robustness:  The protocol should have multiple lines of defense and
      should force an attacker to surmount more than one difficult
      challenge before an attack can succeed (for example, by generating
      encryption keys using as many shared secrets as possible, such as
      retained secrets or optional passwords).
   Upgradability:  The protocol must be upgradable so that, if a
      vulnerability is discovered, a new version can fix it.  Alice must
      tell Bob which versions of the protocol she is prepared to
      support.  Upgradability refers to the protocol as a whole as well
      as to components thereof (e.g., cryptographic hashing algorithms).


5.  Application Requirements

   In addition to the foregoing security profile, this document also
   stipulates the following application-specific requirements:

   Generality:  The solution must be generally applicable to the full
      content of any XML stanza type (<message/>, <presence/>, and
      <iq/>) sent between two entities.  It is deemed acceptable if the
      solution does not apply to many-to-many stanzas (e.g., groupchat
      messages sent within the context of multi-user chat) or one-to-
      many stanzas (e.g., presence "broadcasts" and publish-subscribe
      notifications); end-to-end encryption of such stanzas might
      require separate solutions.
   Implementability:  The only good security technology is an
      implemented security technology.  The solution should be one that
      XMPP client developers can implement in a relatively
      straightforward and interoperable fashion.  Ideally the solution
      would reuse existing technologies so that client developers can
      also reuse existing libraries, as they already do for security
      features such as Transport Layer Security [TLS] and the Simple
      Authentication and Security Layer [SASL].
   Usability:  The requirement of usability takes implementability one
      step further by stipulating that the solution should be one that
      organizations can deploy and humans can use with the ease-of-use
      of, say, "https:" URLs.  Experience has shown that solutions
      requiring a full public key infrastructure do not get widely
      deployed and that solutions requiring any user action are not
      widely used.  If, however, Alice and/or Bob are prepared to verify
      the integrity of their copies of each other's keys (thus enabling
      them to discover targeted active attacks or even the mass
      surveilance of a population), then the actions necessary for them
      to achieve that should be minimal (requiring no more effort than a
      one-time out-of-band verification of a string of up to 8



Saint-Andre             Expires September 9, 2010               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            XMPP E2E Requirements               March 2010


      alphanumeric characters).
   Efficiency:  Cryptographic operations are highly CPU intensive,
      particularly public key and Diffie-Hellman operations.
      Cryptographic data structures can be relatively large, especially
      public keys and certificates.  Network round trips can introduce
      unacceptable delays, especially over high-latency wireless
      connections.  The solution must perform efficiently even when CPU
      and network bandwidth are constrained.  The number of stanzas
      required for negotiation of encrypted communication should be
      minimized.
   Flexibility:  The solution must be compatible with a variety of
      existing and future cryptographic algorithms and identity
      certification schemes, including [X509] and [OpenPGP].  The
      protocol must also be able to evolve to correct the weaknesses
      that are inevitably discovered once any cryptographic protocol is
      in widespread use.
   Offline messages:  It should be possible to encrypt one-to-one
      communications that are stored for later delivery (so-called
      "offline messages") and still benefit from Perfect Forward Secrecy
      (with a slightly longer period of vulnerability than if both
      parties were online simultaneously).  However, any vulnerabilities
      introduced into the solution in order to enable such offline
      communications must not make real-time communications more
      vulnerable.
