Abstract

   This document is an implementation report for the Shortest Path
   Routing Extensions to BGP protocol as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lsvr-bgp-spf].  The authors did not verify the accuracy of
   the information provided by respondents.  The respondents are experts
   with the implementations they reported on, and their responses are
   considered authoritative for the implementations for which their
   responses represent.  The respondents were asked to only use the
   "YES" answer if the feature had at least been tested in the lab.

Requirements Language

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-lsvr-bgp-spf] describes an alternative solution which
   leverages BGP-LS [RFC7752] and the Shortest Path First algorithm
   similar to Internal Gateway Protocols (IGPs) such as OSPF [RFC2328].
   The solution introduces an new BGP-LS-SPF AFI-SAFI and replaces the
   Phase 1 and 2 decision functions of the Decision Process specifed by
   [RFC4271] with the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm also known as
   the Dijkstra algorithm.  This solution avails the benefits of both
   BGP and SPF-based IGPs that include TCP based flow-control, no
   periodic link-state refresh, and completely incremental NLRI
   advertisements.  These advantages can reduce the overhead in MSDCs
   where there is a high degree of Equal Cost Multi- Path (ECMPs) and
   the topology is very stable.  Additionally, using an SPF-based
   computation can support fast convergence and the computation of Loop-
   Free Alternatives (LFAs) [RFC5286] in the event of link failures.
