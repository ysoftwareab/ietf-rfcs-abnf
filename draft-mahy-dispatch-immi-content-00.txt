1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2219].

   The terms MLS client, MLS group, and KeyPackage have the same
   meanings as in the MLS protocol [I-D.ietf-mls-protocol].

2.  Introduction

   MLS [I-D.ietf-mls-protocol] is a group key establishment protocol
   motivated by the desire for group chat with efficient end-to-end
   encryption.  While one of the motivations of MLS is interoperable
   standards-based secure messaging, the MLS protocol does not define or
   prescribe any format for the encrypted "application messages" encoded
   by MLS.  The development of MLS was strongly motivated by the needs
   of a number of Instant Messaging (IM) systems, which encrypt messages
   end-to-end using variations of the Double Ratchet protocol [].

   End-to-end encrypted instant messaging was also a motivator for the
   Common Protocol for Instant Messaging (CPIM) [RFC3862], however the
   model used at the time assumed standalone encryption of each message
   using a protocol such as S/MIME [RFC8551] or PGP [RFC3156] to
   interoperate between IM protocols such as SIP [RFC3261] and XMPP
   [RFC6120].  For a variety of practical reasons, interoperable end-to-
   end encryption between IM systems was never deployed commercially.

   There are now several vendors prepared to implement MLS.  In order to
   enable interoperable messaging conveyed "inside" MLS application
   messages, some additional specification and some minor changes are
   required.  Also, the expectation of what constitutes basic features
   common across multiple IM systems has grown.  It would be beneficial
   to provide an interoperable format for these additional features as
   well.  Most of these features can be implemented using a profile
   which describes how to use already-defined URIs, message headers, and
   MIME types.

   This proposal assumes that MLS clients can advertise MIME types they
   support and that MLS clients can determine what MIME types are
   required to join a specific MLS group.  A companion proposal
   [I-D.mahy-dispatch-immi-mls-mime] defines two MLS extensions which
   meets this requirement.  It would allow implementations to define
   groups with different MIME type requirements and it would allow MLS
   clients to send extended or proprietary messages that would be
   interpreted by some members of the group while assuring that an
   interoperable end-to-end encrypted baseline is available to all
   members, even when the group spans multiple systems or vendors.

   Below is a list of some features commonly found in IM group chat
   systems:

   *  plain text and rich text messaging
   *  delivery notifications
   *  read receipts
   *  replies
   *  reactions

   *  edit or delete previously sent messages
   *  expiring messages
   *  knock / ping
   *  shared files/audio/videos
   *  calling / conferencing

3.  Overview

3.1.  Naming schemes

   IM systems have a number of types of identifiers.  Not all systems
   use every type:

   *  client/device identifier (internal representation)
   *  user identifier
   *  handle identifier (external, friendly representation)
   *  group conversation identifier
   *  group or or channel name (external, friendly representation)
   *  team identifier (less common)

   One user may have multiple clients (for example a mobile and a
   desktop client).  A handle may refer to a single user or it may
   redirect to multiple users.  In some systems, the user identifier is
   a handle.  In other systems the user identifier is an internal
   representation, for example a UUID.  Handles may be changed/renamed,
   but hopefully internal user identifiers do not.  Unqualified handles
   are often prefixed with a commercial at-sign ("@").

   Likewise, group conversation identifiers could be internal or
   external representations, whereas group names or channel names are
   often external friendly representations.  Unqualified channel names
   are often prefixed with a hash character ("#").  Some systems have an
   additional level of hierarchy with a team identifier under which
   groups/channels can be organized and authorized.

   This proposal relies on URIs for naming and identifiers.  All the
   example use the im: URI scheme (defined in [RFC3862]), but any
   instant messaging scheme is acceptable.

3.2.  Negotiation of MIME types

   As most IM systems are proprietary, standalone systems, it is useful
   to allow clients to send and receive proprietary formats among
   themselves.  Using the multipart/alternative MIME wrapper, clients
   can send a message using the basic functionality described in this
   document AND a proprietary format for same-vendor clients
   simultaneously over the same group with end-to-end encryption.

   [I-D.mahy-dispatch-immi-mls-mime] contains the actual MLS extensions
   useful for negotiating MIME types.  The profile in this document
   requires support for receiving message/cpim, text/plain, text/
   markdown, and multipart MIME.  All other mime types (including some
   recommended in this profile) are optional.

   Example sending this profile and proprietary messaging protocol
   simultaneously.

   Content-type: multipart/alternative

3.3.  CPIM and MIME headers

   We assume that an MLS group is already established and that either
   out-of-band or using the MLS protocol or MLS extensions that the
   following is known to every member of the group:

   *  The membership of the group (via MLS).
   *  The identity of any MLS client which sends an application message
      (via MLS).
   *  The MLS group ID (via MLS)
   *  The human readable name(s) of the MLS group, if any (out-of-band
      or extension).
   *  Which MIME types are mandatory to implement (proposed extension).
   *  For each member, the MIME types each supports (proposed
      extension).

   For all messages the message header equivalent of To (the MLS group)
   and Sender fields (MLS sender) is already known and is therefore
   redundant.  Every message contains a message/cpim header which
   includes the From, DateTime, and Message-ID fields.  The From field
   contains the external, user-friendly representation of the Sender.

   Messages sent to an MLS group are delivered to every member of the
   group active during the epoch in which the message was sent.

   It is also mandatory to understand are the following MIME headers:

   *  Content-Type
   *  Content-Disposition
   *  Content-Length

4.1.  Original Message

   In this example, Alice Smith sends a rich-text (Markdown) [RFC7763]
   message to the Engineering Team MLS group.  The following values are
   implied as if headers were present:

   *  Implied Sender header from MLS sender: im:3b52249d-68f9-45ce-8bf5-
      c799f3cad7ec-0003@example.com (im:3b52249d-68f9-45ce-8bf5-
      c799f3cad7ec-0003@example.com)
   *  Implied To header from MLS group: "Engineering Team" im:9dc867ca-
      3a01-4385-bb69-1573601c3c0c@example.com (im:9dc867ca-
      3a01-4385-bb69-1573601c3c0c@example.com)

   Content-type: message/cpim

   From: <im:alice-smith@example.com>
   DateTime: 2022-02-08T22:13:45-00:00
   Message-ID: <28fd19857ad7@example.com>

   Content-Type: text/markdown;charset=utf-8

   Hi everyone, we just shipped release 2.0. __Good work__!

4.2.  Reply

   A reply message looks similar, but contains an In-Reply-To CPIM
   header with the ID of the original message.  The implied To header is
   the same all example messages in this section.  The implied Sender
   header is always the MLS sender, and will not be shown in subsequent
   example messages.

   Content-type: message/cpim

   From: <im:bob-jones@example.com>
   DateTime: 2022-02-08T22:13:57-00:00
   Message-ID: <e701beee59f9@example.com>
   In-Reply-To: <28fd19857ad7@example.com>

   Content-Type: text/markdown;charset=utf-8

   Right on! _Congratulations_ 'all!

4.3.  Reaction

   A reaction, uses the reaction Content-Disposition token defined in
   [RFC9078].  This Content-Disposition token indicates that the
   intended disposition of the contents of the message is a reaction.

   The content in the sample message is a single Unicode heart character
   (U+2665).  Discovering the range of characters each implementation
   could render as a reaction can occur out-of-band and is not within
   the scope of this proposal.  However, an implementation which
   receives a reaction character string it does not recognize could
   render the reaction as a reply, possibly prefixing with a localized
   string such as "Reaction: ".  Note that a reaction could
   theoretically even be another media type (ex: image, audio, or
   video), although not currently implemented in major instant messaging
   systems.

   Content-type: message/cpim

   From: <im:cathy-washington@example.com>
   DateTime: 2022-02-08T22:13:57-00:00
   Message-ID: <1a771ca1d84f@example.com>
   In-Reply-To: <28fd19857ad7@example.com>

   Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8
   Content-Disposition: reaction

   ♥

4.4.  Mentions

   In instant messaging systems and social media, a mention allows
   special formatting and behavior when a name, handle, or tag
   associated with a known group is encountered, often when prefixed
   with a commercial-at "@" character for mentions of users or a hash
   "#" character for groups or tags.  A message which contains a mention
   may trigger distinct notifications on the IM client.

   We can convey a mention by linking the user, handle, or tag URI in
   Markdown or HTML rich content.  For example, a mention using Markdown
   is indicated below.

   Content-type: message/cpim

   From: <im:cathy-washington@example.com>
   DateTime: 2022-02-08T22:14:03-00:00
   Message-ID: <4dcab7711a77@example.com>

   Content-Type: text/markdown;charset=utf-8

   Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8

   <p>Kudos to <a href="im:alice-smith@example.com">@Alice
   Smith</a> for making the release happen!</p>

4.5.  Edit

   Unlike with email messages, it is common in IM systems to allow the
   sender of a message to edit or delete the message after the fact.
   Typically the message is replaced in the user interface of the
   receivers (even after the original message is read) but shows a
   visual indication that it has been edited.

   We reuse the Supersedes header from MIXER [RFC2156], because the
   semantics are correct: the message included in the body is a
   replacement for the message with the superseded message ID.

   Here Bob Jones corrects a typo in his original message:

   Content-type: message/cpim

   From: <im:bob-jones@example.com>
   DateTime: 2022-02-08T22:13:57-00:00
   Message-ID: <89d3472622a4@example.com>
   Supersedes: <e701beee59f9@example.com>

   Content-Type: text/markdown;charset=utf-8

   Right on! _Congratulations_ y'all!

4.6.  Delete

   In IM systems, a delete means that the author of a specific message
   has retracted the message, regardless if other users have read the
   message or not.  Typically a placeholder remains in the user
   interface showing that a message was deleted.  Replies which
   reference a deleted message typically hide the quoted portion and
   reflect that the original message was deleted.

   If Bob deleted his message instead of modifying it, we would
   represent it using the Supersedes header with an empty body, as shown
   below.

   Content-type: message/cpim

   From: <im:bob-jones@example.com>
   DateTime: 2022-02-08T22:13:57-00:00
   Message-ID: <89d3472622a4@example.com>
   Supersedes: <e701beee59f9@example.com>

   Content-Length: 0

4.7.  Expiring

   Expiring messages are designed to be deleted automatically by the
   receiving client at a certain time whether they have been read or
   not.  As with manually deleted messages, there is no guarantee that a
   uncooperative client or a determined user will not save the content
   of the message, however most clients respect the convention.

   MIXER defines an Expires header which is also used sent simply by
   including an Expires header in the CPIM message body.

   To avoid using two different date header syntaxes, we define an
   ExpiresDateTime header, which uses the same date/time format as
   CPIM's DateTime header.  The semantics of the header are that the
   message is automatically deleted by the receiving clients at the
   indicated time without user interaction or network connectivity
   necessary.

   Content-type: message/cpim

   From: <im:alice-smith@example.com>
   DateTime: 2022-02-08T22:49:03-00:00

4.8.  Knock

   A knock or ping is message sent to get the attention of a user or a
   group of users.  It might be sent when a user has not responded to
   direct messages or mentions, or in a group when something requires
   the attention of everyone quickly (ex: a serious unusual situation
   like a major system outage).

   We represent a knock as a text/plain body containing a single CRLF
   with the alert Content-Disposition token (defined in [RFC3261]).

   Content-type: message/cpim

   From: <im:alice-smith@example.com>
   DateTime: 2022-02-08T22:13:45-00:00
   Message-ID: <c1a3375bfe3f@example.com>

   Content-Type: text/plain
   Content-Disposition: alert

4.9.  Read Receipt

   In instant messaging systems, read receipts typically generate a
   distinct indicator for each message.  In some systems, the number of
   users in a group who have read the message is subtly displayed and
   the list of users who read the message is available on further
   inspection.

   Of course, Internet mail has support for read receipts as well, but
   the existing message disposition notification mechanism defined for
   email in [RFC8098] is unfortunately inappropriate in this context.

   *  notifications can be sent by intermediaries
   *  only one notification can be sent about a single message per
      recipient
   *  a human-readable version of the notification is expected
   *  each notification can refer to only one message
   *  it is extremely verbose

   The proposed format below, message/immi-disposition-notification is
   sent by one member of an MLS group to the entire group and can refer
   to multiple messages.  There is one IMMI-Disposition line per
   message, with the disposition of the original message in a parameter.
   As the disposition at the recipient changes, the disposition can be
   updated in a subsequent notification.

   IMMI-Disposition: <5c95a4dfddab@example.com>;dispo=expired

4.10.  Attachments

   The message/external-body MIME Type is a convenient way to present a
   URL to download an attachment which should not be rendered inline.

   Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type="URL";
    URL="https://example.com/storage/bigfile.m4v";
    size=708234961

4.11.  Conferencing

   Joining a conference via URL is also possible.  The link could be
   rendered to the user, requiring a click.  Alternatively another
   Content-Disposition could be specified to more automatic actions.
   However further calling and conferencing functionality is out-of-
   scope of this document.

   Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type="URL";
    URL="https://example.com/join/12345"

5.  IMMI CPIM profile

   We define a profile of CPIM for instant messaging within MLS.  The
   grammar uses Augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) [RFC5234].

5.1.  CPIM headers

   The following CPIM headers are required:

   *  From: the identity of message sender. for example
      im:alice@example.com this identity could be pseudonymous or
      anonymous if the group policy allows.
   *  DateTime: the date and time in a reasonable format, as specified

   *  Message-ID: a message ID which is unique across domains.
   *  Content-type: As is from CPIM.
   *  In-Reply-To: Refers to the previous Message-ID.  Same semantics as
      in [RFC5322].
   *  Supersedes: Refers to the previous Messsage-ID.  Similar semantics
      to header of the same name in MIXER.  Content-Disposition: The
      intended handling of the message.  The two required dispositions
      are render and reaction.
   *  Content-Length:

   For clarity the grammar for the headers not already included in CPIM
   are formulated below.

 msg-id-header-line = msg-id-header ":" SP msg-id CRLF
 msg-id-header = "Message-ID"   ; case-sensitive

 in-reply-to-header-line = in-reply-to-header ":" SP msg-id CRLF
 in-reply-to-header = "In-Reply-To"   ; case-sensitive

 supersedes-header-line = supersedes-header ":" SP msg-id CRLF
 supersedes-header = "Supersedes"   ; case-sensitive


 msg-id = "<" id-left "@" id-right ">"

 id-left  = dot-atom-text
 id-right = dot-atom-text / no-fold-literal

 dot-atom-text   =   1*atext *("." 1*atext)

 atext = ALPHA / DIGIT / atom-symbol

 atom-symbol = "!" / "#" / "$" / "%" / "&" / "'" / "*" / "+" / "-" /
               "/" / "=" / "?" / "^" / "_" / "`" / "{" / "|" / "}" / "~"

 no-fold-literal = "[" *dtext "]"

 dtext = %d33-90 / %d94-126 ; Printable US-ASCII
                            ; excluding "[", "]", and "\"

5.2.  Definition of message/immi-disposition-notification

   The grammar below defines the syntax.

   immi-disposition-notification-body = 1*immi-header-line

   immi-header-line = immi-header ":" SP msg-id ";" status CRLF

   imm-header = "IMMI-Disposition" ; case-sensitive

   status = "dispo" "=" status-value

   status-value = "read" /
                  "error" /
                  "delivered" /
                  "expired" /
                  "deleted" /
                  "hidden"
