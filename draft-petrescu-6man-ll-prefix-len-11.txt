Abstract

   A rejected Errata to RFC4291 "IPv6 Addr Archi" on the topic of link-
   local addresses 'needs' a draft.  This is an answer to that need.

   The length of the prefix of an IPv6 link-local address is variable.
   The minimal value is 10 decimal.  The maximum value is 127 decimal.

1.  Definitions and Statements

   The prefix of an IP address is formed by the n leftmost bits of the
   address.  (in a left-to-right writing system).

   The prefix of an IP address is used for goals such as: identify the
   type of an IPv6 address (link-local, global, others), identify the
   belonging of an IP address to a particular subnetwork, assist the
   forwarding (or not forwarding) decisions, and others.

   The minimal length of the prefix of an IPv6 link-local address (the
   value of n) is equal to 10 decimal.  The maximum is 127.

   The prefix of an IPv6 link-local address is represented textually as
   "fe80::/n", where n MAY be any value between 10 and 127.

   Regardless of the prefix length, the leftmost 10 bits of an IPv6
   link-local address MUST be set to binary 1111111010 (hexadecimal
   fe80).

   The illustration of an IPv6 link-local address is:

                   Figure 1: The IPv6 link-local address

   Examples: fe80::1/10, fe80:1::1/32 and fe80::1:1/64 are all IPv6
   link-local addresses; their prefix lengths are 10, 32 and 64
   respectively.  Each such IPv6 address has the leftmost 10 bits equal
   to binary 1111111010.

   The Difficulty: the number binary 1111111010 can not be written in
   hexadecimal without specifying the number of significant bits
   (fe80::/10); yet that does not make it a 'prefix'.  Converting
   1111111010 to hexadecimal leads to 3FA (because in a left-to-right
   writing system the leading 0s before comma are irrelevant); yet '3FA'
   is not commonly known to be the leading bits of an IPv6 link-local
   address, fe80::/10 is.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   prefix: a contiguous string of bits valid for forwarding operations
   and for subnet formation.  A prefix MUST have an integer length value
   from 1 to 127 (except when the prefix length is for default route, in
   which case the value is 0) and a prefix length must be indicated in
   its textual representation (e.g. 2001:db8::/32 is the prefix and 32
   is the prefix length).

   textual representation of a prefix: e.g. fe80::/64.

   n leading bits: the first n bits in a string of bits read from left
   to right in a writing system that is read left-to-right.  E.g. the 10
   leading bits of the fe80::/64 textual representation of the IPv6
   link-local prefix are 1111111010.

3.  Context

   draft-bourbaki-6man-classless-ipv6-05 describes the motivation of
   considering IPv6 to be classless.  It gives a little bit of history
   of why it is how it is.  It proposes the rigid 64 IID length to be
   probably the last remnant of the boundary.

Internet-Draft                IPv6-LL-plen                    April 2019


   A memo describes the use of IPv6 link-local addresses in
   applications.  The filename of the Internet Draft is draft-smith-
   ipv6-link-locals-apps-00.

   The RFC "IPv6 Address Archi" illustrates the format of the link-local
   addresses.  From the illustration it MAY be understood that the
   length of the link-local prefix is 10 bits of value 1111111010 and 54
   0 bits.

   IANA lists the "IPv6 prefix", and "Address Block", to be "fe80::/10"
   on its website.  It is possible that in the future the IETF could
   decide to use the bits 11-53.

   The RFC 2464 "IPv6-over-Ethernet" states that the prefix for link-
   local addresses is "fe80::/64".

   RFC 6874, "Representing IPv6 Zone Identifiers in Address Literals and
   Uniform Resource Identifiers" specifies the link-local addresses to
   be under prefix "fe80::/10".

   RFC 8415 "DHCPv6" considers that link-local addresses are designated
   by the prefix fe80::/10.

   RFC 4007 "IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture" discusses Zone ID.  A
   Zone ID may be used - internally - in the 54bits of a link-local
   address, even though these 54bits appear to be reset.  The document
   mentions at a point that fe80::1 could be used in two separate
   physical links (not virtual, like the loopback).

   RFC4291 requires that an IPv6 link-local address be assigned on each
   interface.  Yet, it does not require the link-local prefix to be
   associated to an interface.

   RFC4861 requires that the link local prefix be present in the Prefix
   List associated with an interface, although it does not specify the
   length of the link local prefix.

   Several knowledgeable interpretations state that, generally speaking,
   the prefix length of link-local addresses is 10, but it is 64 in the
   particular case of Stateless Address-Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).  In
   this latter case, the prefix is named a "subnet prefix", or "prefix
   on a link", and it is "fe80::/64".

   Independent testing shows that 'ifconfig add fe80:1::1' works on
   linux but fails on openbsd.

   Interpretations of the situation of linux working ok with fe80:1::1
   call it a violation of standards.

Internet-Draft                IPv6-LL-plen                    April 2019


   Implementations of an IPv6 stack in a particular operating system
   (linux) allow for the manual configuration of both prefix lengths 64
   and 10 for link-local addresses.

   In another operating system the prefix length for link-local
   addresses can not be explicitely specified by the end user, but may
   be indirectly derived from two distinct textual formats by using an
   unspecified rule.

   In yet another operating system (FreeBSD) an end user can not use a
   link-local address whose value is fe80:1::1; because in that OS the
   hosts drop incoming packets whose source or destination address
   matches fe80::/10 and contains a non-0 value in bits 15-31 (like
   fe80:1::1 does).  The URL of the C code in OpenBSD that leads to make
   that packet drop is
   https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/master/sys/netinet6/ip6_input.c

   In a particular operating system (openbsd), it is possible to run
   SLAAC with Interface IDentifiers of length different than 64, e.g.
   100; this implements RFC7217.  In that same operating system it is
   not possible to use an Interface Identifier of length 100.  At the
   same time, in another operating system (linux) it is possible to use
   Interface IDentifiers of length 100, yet SLAAC does not work with IID
   that is not 64.  In an ideal linux-bsd operating system any length of
   IID would be possible.

   The loopback interface is required to have a link-local address too
   (RFC4291), although some OSs dont (linux).  The RFC4007 clarifies
   that, somehow.

   Misconfigurations and lack of interoperability MAY arise between
   computers that use mixed prefix lengths for link-local addresses.

   Historical note: earlier, the link-local prefix fe80::/10 and site-
   local prefix fec0::/10 were grouped into a common fe80::/9.  If bits
   10-64 were 0 then the prefix was a link-local, otherwise a site-
   local.  The site-local addresses were later deprecated by RFC 3879.

4.  Example of use of LL Prefix Length 32

   This figure shows two routers each with two interfaces; one such
   interface is connected to the other router; there are two interfaces
   that point elsewhere.

    i2 address is fe80:12::1:1/32 ('12' means subnet between R1 and R2,
    '1' is R1, 2nd '1' is 'front' interface)
    i3 address is fe80:12::2:2/32


                             Figure 2: Figure

   One router's interface (connected to the other router) uses address
   fe80:12::1:1/32 and the other router's corresponding interface uses
   address fe80:12::2:2/32.

5.  Security Considerations

   The clarification of the definition of the prefix length of the IPv6
   link-local prefix at IANA is: call it 'leading bits' and not
   'prefix', or state that the IPv6 prefix length of link-local
   addresses is 10 decimal.  This clarification has beneficial impact in
   the algorithm implementation for calculation of the opaque and stable
   Interface Identifiers for IPv6 link-local addresses.  It also
   positively impacts some implementations of IPv6 forwarding.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to change the name of the column head in the table
   that depicts the "Internet Protocol Version 6 Address Space".  The
   name should be "The n leading bits of an address" instead of "IPv6
   Prefix".

   The desired effect of this change is that the IPv6 link-local prefix
   be "fe80::/n" and that the 10 leading bits of this prefix be
   1111111010.  A second effect would be that the textual representation
   "fe80::/10" as an IPv6 link-local prefix would disappear from that
   IANA page.

Appendix A.  ChangeLog

   The changes are listed in reverse chronological order, most recent
   changes appearing at the top of the list.

   -11: trying the attribute updates=RFC4291,RFC4007 in the rfc tag.

   -10: syntax error corrected; more explanation about how FreeBSD C
   code blocks fe80:1::1; clarification in IANA section, but doubtful.

   -09: added a reference to RFC 4007 about Zone ID in LL; added a
   reference to draft-bourbaki about IPv6 being classless; added the
   result of independent testing showing ifconfig add fe80:1::1 works on
   linux but fails on BSD; added URL to C code in BSD flavor that may be
   in charge of dropping packets whose src/dst is an LL like fe80:1::1;
   added two co-authors.

   -08: added explanation of which RFC requires the LL address to be
   present, and which requires the LL prefix to be present; named the
   OSs, instead of staying generic; explained that the lack of
   requirement of ll address on lo in RFC4291 is covered by another
   RFC4007; explained that openbsd allows variable len IID for GUAs but
   not for LLs, yet linux allows the reverse, and concluded on an
   obvious ideal.

   -07: added the fact that DHCPv6 spec considers the link-local
   addresses to be fe80::/10; added a valuable explanation of ll
   behaviour of a particularly important OS.

   -04: added an example advantage of using prefix length 32.
