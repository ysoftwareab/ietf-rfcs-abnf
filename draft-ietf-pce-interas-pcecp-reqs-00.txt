1.   Introduction 
 
   MPLS Inter-AS traffic engineering requirements [INTERAS-TE-REQ] 
   defined the scenarios motivating the deployment of inter-AS MPLS 
   traffic engineering. [INTERAS-TE-REQ] also specified the requirements 
   for inter-AS MPLS traffic engineering when the ASes are under one 
   Service Provider (SP) administration or the administration of 
   different SPs. 
    
   Today, there are three signaling options in setting up an inter-AS 
   TE LSP: 1) contiguous TE LSP as documented in [INTERD-TESIG]; 2) 
   Stitched inter-AS TE LSP discussed in [LSP-STITCHING]; 3) nested TE 
   LSP as in [LSP-HIERARCHY]. In addition, [INTERD-TE-PDPC] defines 
   mechanisms for inter-domain path computation using network elements 
   along the signaling and data paths.  The mechanisms in [INTERD-TE-

   PDPC] do not provide the capability to guarantee an optimum TE path 
   across multiple ASes. A (G)MPLS-TE optimum path for an LSP is one 
   that has the smallest cost, according to a normalized TE metric 
   (based upon a TE-metric or IGP metric adopted in each transit AS), 
   among all possible paths that satisfy the LSP TE-constraints. 
    
   The requirements for a PCE have risen from SP needs to compute a more 
   optimum path than that can be achieved by mechanisms provided in 
   [INTERD-TE-PDPC], and be able to separate the path computation 
   elements from the forwarding elements. 
    
   Generic requirements for the PCE discovery protocol (PCEDP) and 
   PCC/PCE-PCE communication protocol (PCECP) are discussed in [PCEDP-
   REQ] and [PCECP-REQ], respectively. Complementary to these already-
   defined generic requirements, this document provides a set of PCECP 
   requirements that are specific to (G)MPLS-TE inter-AS path 
   computation using a PCE-based approach. 
    
   Section 2 of this document states some definitions. Section 3 defines 
   a reference model. Section 4 states inter-AS PCECP requirements. 
   Section 5 discusses security issues. 
 
2.   Definitions 
 
   This document adopts the definitions and acronyms defined in 
   [INTERAS-TE-REQ] Section 3.1 and [PCE-ARCH] Section 2. In addition, 
   we use the following terminology: 
    
    PCECP: PCE Communication Protocol 
     
    PCEDP: PCE Discovery Protocol 
     
    Inter-AS (G)MPLS-TE path: A (G)MPLS-TE path that traverses two or 
    more ASes 
     
    Intra-AS (G)MPLS-TE path: A (G)MPLS-TE path that is confined to a
    single AS. It may traverse on or more IGP areas. 
      
    Inter-area PCE: A PCE responsible for computing (G)MPLS-TE paths or 
    path segments traversing across multi-IGP areas. 
 
    Intra-AS PCE: A PCE responsible for computing (G)MPLS-TE paths 
    traversing a single AS. 
     
    Inter-AS PCE: A PCE responsible for computing inter-AS (G)MPLS- 
    TE paths or path segments, by possibly cooperating with intra-AS 
    PCEs, across one or more ASes.

3.   Reference Model 
    
   Figure 1 depicts the reference model for PCEs in an inter-AS          
   application. We refer to two types of PCE functions in this document: 
   inter-AS PCEs and intra-AS PCEs. Inter-AS PCEs perform the procedures 
   needed for inter-AS (G)MPLS-TE path computation while intra-AS PCEs 
   perform the functions needed for intra-AS (G)MPLS-TE path 
   computation. This document focuses on the PCE Communication Protocol 
   requirements used by inter-AS PCEs to communicate path 
   requests/responses to other inter-AS PCEs and by intra-AS PCEs to 
   communicate path requests/responses to inter-AS PCEs and vice versa.

4.   Detailed PCECP Requirements for Inter-AS (G)MPLS-TE  
    
   This section discusses detailed PCECP requirements for inter-AS 
   (G)MPLS-TE applications using a PCE-based approach. Depending on the 
   operation environment, service providers may use some or all of the 
   capabilities of a PCECP that satisfies these requirements. 
   Specifically, some requirements are more applicable to inter-AS 
   inter-provider (G)MPLS-TE operation than intra-provider operations.   
     
    
     
4.1.1.       PCC/PCE-PCE Communication Protocol Requirements  
     
   Requirements specific to inter-AS PCECP path computation requests 
   and responses are discussed in section 4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.2,
   respectively.  
    
    
 
 
 4.1.1.1.          Requirements on path computation requests  
     
 
Bitar, Zhang et al.                                           [Page 4] 
  
Internet Draft  draft-ietf-pce-interas-pcecp-reqs-00   August 2006 


   Following are inter-AS specific requirements on PCECP requests for 
   path computation 
    
   - PCECP MUST allow the specification of a path computation request    
   priority as specified in [PCECP-REQ]. Priority-based message 
   processing is a local decision to a PCE and is out of the scope of 
   this document. However, in inter-AS operation, a policy may be 
   enforced on a path computation request so that the path computation 
   request priority is altered when progressing the request within the 
   same AS or across other ASes. PCECP SHOULD allow the notification of 
   the requester of such a change when it happens. Such notification MAY 
   be suppressed by configuration action on a neighboring inter-AS PCE 
   basis.  
    
   - A path computation request to an inter-AS PCE MUST be able to     
   specify ASBRs and/or ASes as strict and loose nodes in the path of    
   the LSP to the destination. A PCE MUST also be able to specify a  
   preferred ASBR for exiting to the next AS for reaching the    
   destination through a neighboring AS. If such a constraint cannot 
   be satisfied at a PCE, PCECP SHOULD allow a PCE to notify the 
   requestor of that fact in the path error message.   
        
   - PCECP MUST enable enlisting a list of ASes and/or ASBRs to be 
   excluded in the path computation.  
 
   - PCECP MUST enable an inter-AS PCE to specify the AS on whose behalf 
   it is sending the request. This is specifically important when the 
   inter-AS PCE has identified many ASes within its scope to the other 
   inter-AS PCE at the other end of the communication.   
    
   - A PCC or PCE (including inter-AS PCE) MUST be able to specify in 
   its PCECP path computation request the need for computing an end-to-
   end path with protection against node, link, and/or SRLG  
   failure using 1:1 detours or facility backup. An inter-AS PCE may 
   itself ask for a similarly protected path. In addition, it may ask 
   for protection across all ASes the path can traverse or across 
   specific ASes.  
    
   - A PCC or PCE MUST be able to specify in its path request to an 
   inter-AS PCE the retturn of a minimum of two diversified paths
   (i.e., paths that do not share common nodes, links and/or SRLGs).  
         
    
   - A PCECP path computation request message MUST enable the 
   specification of AS-only diversified path computation. 
    
   - A PCECP path computation request message MUST be able to identify 
   the scope of diversified path computation to be end-to-end (i.e., 
   between the endpoints of the (G)MPLS-TE tunnel) or to be limited to a 
   specific AS.

 4.1.1.2.          Requirements on path computation responses  
     
   Following are inter-AS specific requirements on PCECP responses for 
   path computation: 
 
   - A path computation response MUST be able to include ASBRs and ASes  
   on the computed path. In inter-AS intra-provider path 
   computation, there may not be any confidentiality issues or 
   restrictions that prevent one AS from returning a path with strict 
   hops and no loose hops (i.e., nodes and links) within its AS to the 
   requesting inter-AS PCE. In this case, the head-end of an LSP could 
   receive, as a result of the work of multiple cooperating intra-AS and 
   inter-AS PCEs, a path that contains nodes and links as strict hops 
   from LSP head-end to tail-end.  In the inter-provider case, 
   confidentially and security considerations may require only the 
   return of AS numbers and/or ASBRs in path computation response 
   messages. 
    
   - A PCECP response message MUST be able to carry an identifier for a 
   path segment computed by the responding PCE. Such an identifier could 
   be used in a (G)MPLS-TE path setup message for path expansion at an 
   ASBR.   
     
   - A PCECP response message MUST be able to carry an inter-AS 
   path cost. Path cost normalization across ASes is out 
   of the scope of this document and it is expected to be addressed 
   in other work on path computation.   
    
   - A PCECP response message SHOULD be able to carry an intra-AS cost 
   for a path segment separately from an inter-AS path segment cost. 
   Best path selection procedures based on these costs are out of the 
   scope of this document. 
     
   - A PCECP response message MUST be able to identify diversified paths 
   for the same(G)MPLS-TE LSP when the responding PCE is requested to 
   compute such paths. End-to-end (i.e., between the two endpoints of 
   the (G)MPLS-TE tunnel) disjoint diversified paths are paths that do 
   not share nodes, links or SRLGs except for the LSP head-end and tail-
   end. In cases where diversified path segments are desired within one 
   or more ASes, the diversified path segments may share only the ASBRs 
   of the first AS and the ASBR of the last AS across these ASes.   
        
 
4.1.2.       Scalability and Performance Requirements  
     
   When evaluating a PCECP for the inter-AS case, the following 
   scalability and performance criteria SHOULD be considered:  
        
   - Message Processing load on the inter-AS PCEs and intra-AS PCEs. 
   - Scalability as a function of the following parameters: 
 
Bitar, Zhang et al.                                           [Page 6] 
  
Internet Draft  draft-ietf-pce-interas-pcecp-reqs-00   August 2006 


        - number of PCCs within the scope of an inter-AS PCE  
        - number of intra-area PCEs within the scope of an inter-AS PCE 
        - number of peering inter-AS PCEs 
   - Added complexity and features to the PCC/PCE-PCE communication 
   protocol  
     
     
 
4.1.3.       Management, Aliveness Detection and Recovery Requirements  
     
   [PCECP-REQ] specifies generic requirements for PCECP management. This 
   document addresses new requirements that apply to inter-AS 
   operations. 
    
   The PCECP MIB module MUST provide objects to control the behavior of 
   PCECP in inter-AS applications, including the ASes within its scope, 
   the ASes the PCE cannot communicate with via PCECP, the ASes that the 
   PCE can communicate with, confidentiality policies, and traffic 
   engineering policies. Each of these two latter requirements SHOULD 
   apply per inter-AS PCE and/or AS peer.  
        
   The built-in diagnostic tools MUST enable failure detection and 
   status checking of PCC/PCE-PCE PCECP. Diagnotic tools include 
   statistics collection on the historical behavior of PCECP as 
   specified in [PCECP-REQ]. For inter-AS operations, this statistics 
   SHOULD be collected on per inter-AS PCE peer basis and per AS. For 
   instance, the following statistics SHOULD be collected: 
   - number of successfully satisfied requests 
   - number of rejected requests per reason 
   - number of PCE requests 
   - number of malformed PCECP messages 
   - number of unauthenticated PCECP messages 
 
   The MIB module MUST support trap functions when thresholds are 
   crossed or when important events occur for inter-AS PCEs. These 
   thresholds SHOULD be specifiable per peer AS as well as per peer 
   inter-AS PCE and traps should be accordingly generated.      
    
   Basic liveliness detection for PCC/PCE-PCE communication is described 
   in [PCECP-REQ]. Specifically, the PCECP must allow an inter-AS PCE to 
   check the liveliness of the neighboring inter-AS PCE(s) it is 
   communicating with for inter-AS (G)MPLS-TE path computation. The 
   inter-AS PCECP MIB module SHOULD allow control of liveliness check 
   behavior by providing a liveliness message frequency MIB object. This 
   frequency SHOULD be specified per inter-AS PCE peer. In addition, 
   there SHOULD a MIB object that specifies the dead-interval as a 
   multiplier of the liveliness message frequency so that if no 
   liveliness message is received within that time from an inter-A PCE, 
   the inter-AS PCE is declared unreachable.

4.1.4.       Confidentiality  
     
   Confidentiality mainly applies to inter-provider PCE communication. 
   However, confidentiality rules may also apply among ASes under a 
   single provider. Each SP will in most cases designate some PCEs for 
   inter-AS (G)MPLS-TE path computation within its own administrative 
   domain and some other PCEs for inter-provider inter-As (G)MPLS-TE 
   path computation.  Among the inter-provider-scoped inter-AS PCEs in 
   each SP domain, there may also be a subset of the PCEs specifically 
   enabled for path computation across a specific set of ASes of 
   different peer SPs.     
        
   PCECP SHOULD allow an SP to hide from other SPs the set of hops, 
   within its own AS(es,) traversed by an inter-AS inter-provider 
   (G)MPLS-TE LSP (c.f., Section 5.2.1 of [INTERAS-TE-REQ]).  In a 
   multi-SP administrative domain environment, SPs want to hide their 
   network topologies for security reasons. In addition, SPs do not want 
   to reveal the path traversed by an LSP segment within their domains 
   to other SPs' domains. Thus, for each partial inter-AS LSP path a PCE 
   computes, it may return to its peering PCE in the upstream neighbor 
   AS(es) an inter-AS TE LSP  segment from its own AS(es) without 
   detailing the explicit intra-AS hops plus partial paths with an 
   aggregated TE LSP cost it receives from its downstream PCE. As stated 
   earlier, PCECP responses SHOULD be able to carry path-segment 
   identifiers without the details of that path segment. An ASBR that 
   receives an RSVP-TE path message with an identifier object 
   (new object), it can use that object to contact the PCE keyed by 
   that identifier and extract the identified path segment as well.  
     
4.1.5.       Policy Controls Effecting inter-AS PCECP 
     
   Section 5.2.2 of [INTERAS-TE-REQ] discusses the policy control 
   requirements on the inter-AS RSVP-TE signaling at the AS boundaries 
   for the enforcement of interconnect agreements, attribute/parameter 
   translation and security hardening.    
        
   This section discusses those policy control requirements for PCECP.  
   Please note that SPs may still require ingress policy controls on the 
   actual signaling paths mentioned above to enforce their bilateral or 
   multi-lateral agreements at the AS boundaries.  
        
 4.1.5.1.          Inter-AS PCE Peering Policy Controls  
     
   In a multi-SP administrative domain environment, each SP itself has 
   some policies for a (G)MPLS-TE enabled network. An inter-AS PCE sends 
   path computation requests with some parameters to its neighboring 
   inter-AS PCEs. An inter-AS PCE that receives such requests enforces 
   some policies applied to its neighboring inter-AS PCEs. These 
   policies may include rewriting some of the parameters' values and 
   rejecting requests based on some parameters' values. Such policies 
   may also be applied in the case of multiple ASes within a single SP 
 
Bitar, Zhang et al.                                           [Page 8] 
  
Internet Draft  draft-ietf-pce-interas-pcecp-reqs-00   August 2006 


   administrative domain. Parameters subject to policy include 
   bandwidth, setup/holding priority, Fast Reroute request, 
   Differentiated Services Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) Class Type (CT), 
   and others as specified in section 5.2.2.1 of [INTERAS-TE-REQ].  
    
   For path computation requests that are not compliant with configured 
   policies, PCECP SHOULD enable a PCE to send an error message to the 
   requesting PCC or PCE indicating the cause of errors.  
    
    
     
 4.1.5.2.            Inter-AS PCE Reinterpretation Polices  
     
   Each SP may have different definitions in its use of for example, 
   RSVP-TE session attributes, DS-TE TE classes, etc.  A PCE receiving 
   path computation requests needs to be able to reinterpret some of the 
   attributes and adapt them to the native environment in its own AS for 
   path computation.  A list of such parameters subject to policy 
   reinterpretation can be found in section 5.2.2.2 of [INTERAS-TE-REQ].  
   In addition, the transit SPs along the inter-AS TE path may be GMPLS 
   transport providers which may require reinterpretation of MPLS 
   specific PCECP path request messages for path computation over a 
   GMPLS network.  These interpretation policies must be specifiable on 
   a per-peer inter-AS PCE or AS basis as part of PCECP MIBs discussed

5.   Security Considerations  
     
   Security concerns arise between any two communicating elements 
   especially when the elements belong to different administrative 
   entities. In this case, there are security concerns that need to be 
   addressed for communication among inter-AS PCEs and other PCEs in a 
   single SP administrative domain as well among inter-AS PCEs under 
   different SP administrative domains. [PCECP-REQ] specifies 
   requirements on PCECP to protect against spoofing, snooping and DoS 
   attacks. These requirements become especially important in the multi-
   AS case.  
     
6.   IANA Considerations 
    
   This document makes no requests for IANA action.
