1.  Abstract

This document defines an extension to the ADSL Line MIB [18] for managing
VDSL DMT interfaces.

This document specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant 
to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1 
definitions.

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
    purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
    Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
    STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
    The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC
    2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
    first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
    described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of the SNMP
    message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
    protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
    RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is
    called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and
    RFC 2574 [12].

INTERNET-DRAFT               VDSL-DMT-LINE MIB             February 2001

o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
    first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
    described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol
    operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
    [13].

o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14]
    and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
    2575 [15].

A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [17].

2.1.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
defined in the SMI. In particular, each object type is named by an
OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object
type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
specific instantiation of the object. For human convenience, we
often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
the object type.

3.  Introduction

This document describes an SNMP MIB for managing VDSL DMT Lines.  The 
MIB provides support for a VDSL-DMT specific profile table to be used 
as an extension of the ADSL Line MIB (RFC2662) [18].

The MIB is intended to be compatible with both the SNMPv1 and SNMPv2.   
The MIB will eventually be located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 
transmission, as discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 1213 [19] and 
RFC 2863 [20]) section of this document.  Until approved by the IETF,

vendors may also choose to support it under the experimental tree.

NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: please replace the above paragraph with the
following paragraph when appropriate:

The MIB is located in the MIB tree under MIB-2 transmission, as
discussing in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 1213 [19] and RFC 2863 [20])
section of this document.

3.1.  Relationship of the MIB with Standard MIBs

This section outlines the relationship of this MIB with other MIBs 
described in RFCs and in various degrees of "standardization".
Specifically, MIB-2 as presented in RFC 1213 [19] and RFC 2863 [20]
is discussed.

3.1.1  General MIB-2 Integration (RFCs 1213 and 2863)

The VDSL DMT Line MIB specifies the detailed attributes of a data
interface.  As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2863 [20]. The
IANA has assigned the following ifType to VDSL:

IANAifType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    ...
SYNTAX INTEGER {
    ...
    vdsl(97), -- Very H-Speed Digital Subscrib. Loop
    ...
    }

This MIB will be accessed through the transmission subtree as shown:

vdslInterface  ::= { transmission xxx }
NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: please replace the xxx with an assigned number

3.2   Relationship of the MIB with RFC2662

To be written.

4.  Conventions used in the MIB

4.1.  Textual Conventions

The following textual conventions are defined in the MIB.

o    VdslDmtConfProfileSSF 

    This type is used to specify the number of Symbols per Super 
    Frame.

o    VdslDmtConfProfileSpectrum 

    This type specifies the bin on which to start/stop transmission/

    reception on.

o    VdslDmtConfProfileRFIEnable 

    This type is used to enable/disable the Radio Frequency 
    Interference (RFI) canceller.

o    VdslDmtConfProfileRFIBand 

    This type is used to specify the start/stop frequency of the 
    RFI bands.

o    VdslDmtConfProfilePowerCutback 

    For 256 tones, 6-bit values specify the desired receive Power 
    Spectral Density (PSD).

o    VdslDmtConfProfilePowerBoost 

    This type is used to specify a boost value for the transmit 
    Power Spectral Density (PSD).

o    VdslDmtConfProfileEnergyRedist 

    This type is used to enable/disable energy redistribution.

4.2.  Structure

The MIB provides a profile table for configuring a VDSL DMT line.

o   Line Configuration Group:

    This group supports MIB objects for configuring parameters for
    the VDSL DMT Line.  It contains the following table(s):

    - vdslDMTConfProfileTable

4.3.  Profiles

The MIB defines a profile table, vdslDMTConfProfileTable, that contains
VDSL-specific configuration information.  Further discussion on profile
implementation may be found in RFC2662.

5.  Conformance and Compliance

The following group(s) are mandatory:

    vdslDMTConfProfileGroup

7.  Security Considerations

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
network operations.

No managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-
based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
(users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
(change/create/delete) them.
