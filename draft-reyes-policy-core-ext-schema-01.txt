1. Introduction

   Within the context of this document, the term 'PCELS' (Policy Core
   Extension LDAP Schema) is used to refer to the LDAP object class
   definitions contained in this document.


2. Relationship to other Policy Framework Documents

  This document contains an LDAP schema representing the classes
  defined in the Policy Core Information Model Extensions [PCIM_EXT].
  Other documents may subsequently be produced, with mappings of the
  same PCIM extensions to other storage or transport technologies.
  The document is an extension to [PCLS], which defines the LDAP
  mapping of the Policy Core Information Model [PCIM] to an LDAP
  schema.


3. Inheritance Hierarchy for PCELS

   The following diagram illustrates the class hierarchy for the LDAP
   Classes defined in [PCLS] and the
   LDAP classes defined in this document:

4. General Discussion of Mapping the Model Extensions to LDAP

   The classes described below contain certain optimizations for a
   directory that uses LDAP as an access protocol. One example is the
   use of auxiliary classes to represent some of the associations
   defined in the information model. Note that other storage types might
   need to implement the association differently.


4.1 Summary of Class and Association Mappings

   Forty-nine of the classes in the PCELS come directly from the
   fourty-five corresponding classes in the information model
   extensions.The prefix "pcime" is used to identify these LDAP classes.

<to do>


4.3 Attaching PolicyVariable and PolicyValues to PolicySimpleCondition
   and PolicySimpleAction

   A PolicySimpleCondition as well as a PolicySimpleAction includes a
   single PolicyValue and a single PolicyVariable. Each of them can be
   attached or referenced by a DN.

   The attachment helps create compact PolicyCondition and PolicyAction
   definitions that can be efficiently provisioned and retrieved from
   the repository. On the other hand, referenced PolicyVariables and
   PolicyValues instances can be reused in the construction of multiple
   policies and permit the administrative partitioning of the data and
   policy definitions.


4.4 Aggregation of PolicyRules and PolicyGroups in PolicySets

4.5 Aggregation of actions/conditions in PolicyRules and
     CompoundActions/Conditions.

In PCIM_EXT were defined two new classes that offer the designer the
capability of creating more complex conditions and actions.
CompoundPolicyCondition and CompoundPolicyActionclasses are mapped in
the PCELS' CompoundConditionAuxClass and CompoundActionAuxClass
classes and inherit from pcimConditionAuxClass/pcimActionAuxClass
Because of this inheritance they are stored in the same way the
non-compound conditions/actions are. The compound conditions/actions
defined in the PCIM_EXT are extensions of the rule capability to
associate, grouping and evaluate/execute conditions/actions so the
conditions/actions are associated to the compounds conditions/actions
as they were associated to the rules in the PCLS.

In this section is explained how to store this classes in the
directory. As a general rule, the specific conditions/actions are DIT
contained under rule or compound condition/action classes and attached
to the association classes. The reusable conditions/actions, compound
and non-compound, are contained in reusable containers and attached to
policy instances.

The examples below illustrate the four possible cases combining
specific/reusable compound/non-compound condition/action. The rule has
two compound conditions, each one has two different conditions. The
schemes can be extended in order to store actions.

The mapping of compound conditions/actions and the schemas below are
based on the section 4.4 of the PCLS and how conditions and actions
are associated to rules and repositories.

- First case: specific compound condition/action with specific
   conditions/actions.

#: Number.
CA#: pcimeConditionAssociation structural class.
cc#: pcimeCompoundConditionAuxClass auxiliary class.
c#: pcimConditionAuxClass' subclass.

Because the compound conditions/actions are specific to Rule, the
auxiliary classes  that represent them are attached to, structural
classes pcimeConditionAssociation or pcimeActionAssociation. These
structural classes represent the association between the rule and the
compound condition and compound action . The rule's specific condition/
action are DIT contained in rule entry.

The conditions/actions have to be tied to compound conditions/actions
in the same way as compound conditions/actions are tied to rules, but
association classes do the association between them compound
conditions/actions and its specific conditions/actions.

This case is similar to the first one. The conditions/actions  are
reusable so they are not attached  to the association classes but they
are attached to structural classes in the reusable container. It's
needed that the association classes tie the conditions/actions in
the reusable container using DN references.

Because of the re-usability of the compound compound condition/action
they are attached to structural classes and stored in the reusable
container. They are related to the rule through the DN reference
between the association classes and the compound condition/action.
The specific conditions/actions are DIT contained in the compound
condition/action entries.

All the conditions/actions are reusable so they are stored in
reusable containers. The figure 4 illustrates two different
repositories or reusable containers but the number of containers in the
system depends on the policy administrator so the conditions/actions
could be stored in the same container or each condition/action could be
stored in a different container.


5. Class Definitions

5.1 The pcimePolicySet Class.

   The abstract class PolicySet in the [PCIM_EXT] is introduced to
   provide an abstraction for a set of rules. The class value
   'pcimePolicySet' is used as the mechanism for identifying group and
   rule- related instances in the DIT.

   In [PCIM_EXT], the classes PolicyGroup and PolicyRule are moved, so
   that they are now derived from PolicySet class.

A pcimePolicySet object refers to instances of pcimGroup and
   pcimeRule via the attribute pcimePolicySetList and the attribute
   pcimePolicySetDN in the pcimePolicySetAssociation object class.

   The definition of the abstract class
   pcimePolicySet:

( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1.x
  NAME 'pcimePolicySet'
  DESC 'Abstract class that represents a collection of policies
        that form a coherent set.'
  SUP pcimPolicy
  ABSTRACT
  MAY ( pcimePolicySetName
      $ pcimeDecisionStrategy
      $ pcimRoles
      $ pcimePolicySetList )
)

One of the attributes of the pcimePolicySet class, the pcimRoles is
already defined in [PCLS]. The other three attributes are defined below.

The attribute pcimePolicySetName may be used as naming attribute for
pcimePolicySet entries:









Reyes, et al.              Expires: August 2003                [Page 16]

INTERNET-DRAFT                  PCELS                      February 2003



( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2.x
  NAME 'pcimePolicySetName'
  DESC 'The user-friendly name of a policy set.'
  EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
  ORDERING caseIgnoreOrderingMatch
  SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
  SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
  SINGLE-VALUE
)

The attribute pcimeDecisionStrategy is used to define the evaluation
method among the rules in the policy set and is mapped directly from the
PolicyDecisionStrategy property defined in [PCIM_EXT].

( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2.x
  NAME 'pcimeDecisionStrategy'
  DESC 'The evaluation method used for the components of a
        in the pcimePolicySet. Valid values: 1 [FirstMatching],
        2 [AllMatching]'
  EQUALITY integerMatch
  ORDERING integerOrderingMatch
  SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27
  SINGLE-VALUE
)

The attibute pcimePolicySetList is used to realize the
PolicySetComponent aggregation.

( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2.x
  NAME 'pcimePolicySetList'
  DESC 'List of DN references to the pcimePolicySetAssociation
        entries used to aggregate policy sets.'
  EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
  SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12
)

The subclasses pcimGroup and pcimeRule are now derived from
pcimePolicySet.


5.2 The Structural Class pcimePolicySetAssociation

The pcimePolicySetAssociation class is used to aggregate components into
pcimePolicySet entries. Instances of this class are always subordinated
to the aggregating pcimePolicySet. The aggregation of reusable instances
of (subclasses of) pcimePolicySet are referenced via the
pcimePolicySetDN attribute. Non-reusable instances of (subclasses of)
pcimePolicySet are attached as auxiliary classes directly to the
pcimePolicySetAssociation entries.

  DESC 'Policy priority.'
  EQUALITY integerMatch
  ORDERING integerOrderingMatch

  EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
  SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12
  SINGLE-VALUE
)


5.3 The moved pcimGroup class

The pcimGroup is defined in [PCLS]. Its superclass is changed here so
that the pcimGroup can take advantage of the pcimePolicySet and its
aggregation method.

   (  IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1.2
      NAME 'pcimGroup'
      DESC   'A container for a set of related pcimeRules and/or a set
              of related pcimGroups.'

      MAY    (pcimGroupName)

5.4 The Deprecated Class pcimGroupContainmentAuxClass

The policy group aggregation is replaced by the more comprehensive
policy set aggregation. Therefore this class is deprecated:

5.5 The Deprecated Class pcimRuleContainmentAuxClass

The policy rule aggregation is replaced by the more comprehensive policy
set aggregation. Therefore this class is deprecated.

5.6 The three new pcimeRule classes

The base class representing policy rules is redefined without a priority
attribute. In addition, this class uses the Condition and Action
aggregation methods as the CompoundCondition and the CompoundAction.

     (IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1.x
      NAME 'pcimeRule'
      DESC   'The base class for representing the "If Condition then

       SUP pcimeRule
       STRUCTURAL
     )

The attributes pcimRuleCoditionListType, pcimRuleConditionList and
pcimRuleActionList defined in [PCLS] are replaced in PCELS in order to
reuse them in pcimeCompoundConditionAuxClass and
pcimeCompoundActionAuxClass object classes. The definitions are as
follows:

5.15 The Auxiliary Class pcimeSimpleActionAuxClass.

   This class overwrites an old value of the <variable> and set the new
   <value>. There is an attribute to realize
   pcimePolicyValueInSimplePolicyAction, pcimeValueDN, and
   pcimePolciyVariableInSimplePolicyAction associations,
   pcimeVariableDN. The first attribute is used to attach a variable to
   a SimplePolicyAction and the second one is used to attach a value to
   a SimplePolicyAction.

   The class definition is as follows:
   (  IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1.x
      NAME 'pcimeSimpleActionAuxClass'

pcimeActionList are defined in 5.6 section.


5.17 The Abstract Class pcimeVariable.

Variables specify the property of a flow or an event that should be
matched when evaluating the condition. A given variable selects the
set of matchable value types through the
ExpectedPolicyValuesForVariable association.
The classes definitions are as follows. First, the definition of the
abstract class pcimePolicyVariable:

   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1.x
     NAME 'pcimeVariable'
     DESC 'Base class for representing a variable whose actual
           value can be matched against or set to a specific value.'
     SUP top
     ABSTRACT
     MAY ( pcimeVariableName $ pcimeExpectedValueList )
   )

   The attribute pcimeVariableName is an user-friendly name for the
   variable.

     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
     SINGLE-VALUE
   )

The attribute pcimeExpectedValueList is an unordered set of DNs to
subclasses   of  pcimeValueAuxClass. It maps the PCIM_EXT's
ExpectedPolicyValuesForVariable association:

   ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2.x
     NAME 'pcimeExpectedValueList'
     DESC 'List of DN references to the pcimeValueAuxClass
           entries that represent the acceptable values.'

These RFC documents provide a general framework for security
architecture of the system. However some comments have to be provided
as a consequence of the inclusion of extensions in this own document
and its relation with PCLS doc.

Due to the new considered scenarios, with reusability and information
containers located in other DITs etc, these conditions are expressed in
chapter 4.4 of the [PCLS] document. As a consequence, new types of
threats in the system have to be considered. In fact, it is necessary to
define new security services in order to protect against these new
aspects. As a result of this, the following new security services are
defined:

1) Athentication between entities of the network
2) Mutual authentication between network operator and network entities
   (p.e. DITs)
3) Integrity and confidentiality of links between network entities and
   also in the LDAP directories.

Several definitions and security mechanisms related about DITs can also
obtained from the following ITU specification: X.509 The Directory.
Authentication framework



Reyes, et al.              Expires: August 2003                [Page 41]

INTERNET-DRAFT                  PCELS                      February 2003



Furthermore, the obtention of the OIDs and values of the attributes from
the DITs in a distributed scenario has as a consequence the interaction
between diverse network entities with changes of security domain
and/or administrative domain.

In this directory scenario, with migration of data, the use of DSP
(Directory Service Protocol) protocol with types of queries like
referral, chaining and multicasting with different key management and
authentication among network entities would have to be considered.

Appendix A: Issues

   Some classes need to be added:

   1. pcimeReusablePolicyContainer subclasses.
   Since pcimeRepository and its two subclasses are deprecated we have
   needed to add the pcimeReusablePolicyContainer and two subclasses:
   pcimeReusableContainerInstance (structural) and
   pcimeReusableContainerAuxClass(auxiliary). The class
   pcimeReusableContainer is defined as an abstract class so
   pcimeReusableContainer subclasses are needed in order to
   instanciate classes in the directory.
   RESOLUTION: This issue has been resolved in sections 5.23 and 5.24.

2.We have to add the subclasses pcimRuleActionAssociation
   and pcimActionAssociation
   RESOLUTION: This issue has been resolved using the class
   pcimeActionAssociation. See section 5.8

INTERNET-DRAFT                  PCELS                      February 2003



3. We have to clarify next classes
   pcimePolicyVariableAuxClass.
    pcimePolicyVariableInstance.
    pcimePolicyExplicitVariableAuxClass.
    pcimePolicyImplicitVariableInstance.
RESOLUTION: This issue has been resolved in sections     from 5.17 to
5.22

   4. We have to clarify the mapping of next classes
   PolicyValue and its subclasses.
    PolicyImpliciyVariable subclasses.
RESOLUTION: This issue has been resolved in sections from 5.19 to 5.22


We also consider the next points:
   5. To define classes to search errors and classes to detect failures
   in the system
   (Still it is an open issue)

   6. Because of the policy server is centralized and the LDAP is
   distributed hierarchically could be necessary to add classes in order
   to find duplicates in the information. It can occur, for example when
   updating is excessively often.
(Still it is an open issue)

   7. Mapping between Network domains and the updating of information.
(Still it is an open issue)
   Servers via resource management programs could manage some of these
   topics, even though it is necessary to add specific classes.
(Still it is an open issue)

8. The PolicyRoleCollection class from [PCIM_EXT] is implemented as the
pcimeRoleCollection structural object class. This object class is a
subclass of the abstract pcimPolicy defined in [PCLS]. As a consequence
pcimeRoleCollection instances can be located and retrieved by LDAP
clients that implement the mechanism defined in the section 4.5 of
[PCLS]. An other option to consider is the implementation of
pcimeRoleCollection as a triplet of abstract / structural / auxiliary
subclasses of the abstract dlm1Collection defined by [CIM]. In such
case, however, in order to permit the utilization of the location and
retrieval mechanism mentioned above, it would be necessary to attach a
pcimElementAuxClass to the pcimeRoleCollection instances.
RESOLUTION: CLOSED. The authors agree on the current implementation.

9. Considerations about the relation between performance related to
retrieval of information  and storage capacity of DITs.

10. The following PCIM EXT classes and aggregations need to be addressed:
   FilterEntryBase, IpHeadersFilter, 8021Filter, FilterList and
   EntriesInFilterList.
