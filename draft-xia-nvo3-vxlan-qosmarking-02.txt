  Quality of Service Marking in Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network
                 draft-xia-nvo3-vxlan-qosmarking-02.txt

Abstract

   The Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network enables multiple tenants to
   operate in a data center.  Each tenant needs to be assigned a
   priority group to prioritize their traffic.  Cloud carriers wish to
   use quality of service to differentiate different applications.  For
   these purposes, Quality of Service bits are assigned in the Virtual
   eXtensible Local Area Network outer Ethernet header.  How these bits
   are assigned and are processed in the network are explained in
   detail.  Also the document presents a quality of service framework
   for overlay networks such as Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network.

1.  Introduction

   Data center networks are being increasingly used by telecom operators
   as well as by enterprises.  An important requirement in data center
   networks is multitenancy, i.e. multiple tenants each with their own
   isolated network domain.  Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network
   (VXLAN) is a solution that is gaining polularity in industry
   [RFC7348].  VXLAN overlays a Layer 2 network over a Layer 3 network.
   Each overlay is identified by the VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI).
   VXLAN tunnel end point (VTEP) can be hosted at the the hypervisor on
   the server or higher above in the network.  VXLAN encapsulation with
   a UDP header is only known to the VTEP, the Virtual Machines (VM)
   never sees it.

   It should be noted that in this document, VTEP plays the role of the
   Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) according to NVO3 architecture for
   overlay networks like VXLAN or NVGRE defined in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch].
   NVE interfaces the tenant system underneath with the L3 network
   called the Virtual Network (VN).

   Since VXLAN allows multiple tenants to operate data center operators
   are facing the problem of treating their traffic.  There is interest

   to provide different quality of service to the tenants based on their
   service level agreements.

   Cloud carriers have interest in different quality of service to
   different applications such as voice, video, network control
   applications, etc.  In this case, quality of service marking can be
   done using deep packet inspection (DPI) in order to detect the type
   of application in each packet.

   In this document, we develop Quality of Service marking solution for
   VXLAN as part of the Quality of Service framework for overlay multi-
   tenant networks.  The solution is compatible with IP level
   Differentiated Services model or diffserv described in [RFC2474] and
   [RFC2475].  Configuration guidelines are described in [RFC4594].
   Diffserv interconnection classes and interconnection practice are
   described in [I-D.geib-tsvwg-diffserv-intercon].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  The
   terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC7348].

3.  Problem Statement

   In a VXLAN network multiple tenants are supported.  There is interest
   in assigning different priority to each tenant's traffic based on the
   premium that tenant paies, etc.  In another words, cloud carriers
   would like to categorize tenants into different traffic classes such
   as diamond, gold, silver and bronze classes.

   Cloud carriers wish to categorize the traffic based on the
   application such as voice, video, etc.  Based on the type of the
   application different traffic classes may be identified and different
   priority levels can be assigned to each.

   In order to do these, quality of service marking is needed in VXLAN.

   The solution proposed in this document is based on using VXLAN header
   to mark by Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) when the frames are
   introduced by the virtual machines.

4.  QoS Bits in VXLAN

   Three bits are reserved in VXLAN Outer Ethernet Header's C-Tag 802.1Q
   field/VLAN Tag Information field's priority code point (PCP) field
   shown as QoS-flag in Figure 1.

   Three bits called QoS-flag are reserved to indicate the quality of
   service class that this packet belongs.  These bits will be assigned
   according to the type of traffic carried in this flow, e.g. video,
   voice, critical application, etc.  These assignments in relation to
   IP level Differentiated Services model, diff serv bits or DS field,
   are discussed in Section 7.

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                               |Q o S|                         |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                            Figure 1: QoS Flag

   Priority code point bits are assigned as follows:

   001 - BK or background traffic

   000 - BE or best effort traffic

   010 - EE or Excellent Effort

   011 - CA or Critical Applications

   100 - VI or Video

   101 - VO or Voice

   110 - IC or Internetwork Control

   111 - NC or Network Control

   '111' has the highest priority while '001' has the lowest, for
   example, video traffic has higher priority than web surfing which is
   best effort traffic.

   As can be seen the markings are the same as in IEEE 802.1p
   [IEEE802.1D] which is supported by most switches currently deployed
   that have the QoS capabilities.

   The sender SHOULD assign bits 16-18 with bits assigned values as
   above if the quality of service treatment is needed on this packet.
   The sender SHOULD assign the same bit pattern to all the packets of
   the same flow.

   In real deployment, there are two different mappings to make use of
   the class selector QoS field.

   The first one is based on application priorities.  NVE uses some
   mechanism such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to identify
   application types, and fills in the QoS field based on the identified
   application types.  The below is a possible mapping.

   001 - Reserved

   000 - ftp/email

   010 - Facebook, Twitter, Social Media

   011 - Instant Message

   100 - video

   101 - voice

   110 - High Performance computation

   111 - Reserved

   The second one is based on tenancy priorities.  A cloud carrier could
   exploit the QoS bits in another different way.  The cloud carrier
   categorizes its tenants into different groups such as diamond, gold,
   silver, bronze, standard and so on.  All traffic for a diamond tenant
   has a high priority to be forwarded regardless of application types.
   The below is a possible mapping option.

   001 - Reserved

   000 - Standard

   010 - Bronze

   011 - Silver

   100 - Gold

   101 - Diamond

   110 - Emergency

   111 - Reserved

4.1.  QoS Bits in Outer IP Header

   Outer IPv4 header in VXLAN has type of service (TOS) field of 8 bits.
   Outer IPv6 header is VXLAN has traffic class field of 8 bits.

   In case virtual machines are differentiated services capable, inner
   IP header contains per hop behavior (PHB) settings inline with
   diffserv RFCs.  VXLAN NVE SHOULD copy inner IP header QoS bits into
   outer IP header bits.

   In case virtual machines are not differentiated services capable,
   outer IP header QoS bits MUST be assigned by VXLAN NVE.  VXLAN NVE
   SHOULD assign one of the class selector (CS) codepoints with value
   'xxx000' corresponding to the marking explained above if the packet
   is a unicast packet.  For more details, see Section 7.

5.  Quality of Service Operation at VXLAN Decapsulation Point

   There are two types of VXLAN packets receivers, that is, a VXLAN
   enabled NVE or a VXLAN gateway [I-D.sarikaya-nvo3-proxy-vxlan].

   When the VXLAN enabled NVE receives the packet, it decapsulates the
   packet and delivers it downstream to a corresponding VM.  If there
   are multiple packets to be processed, packets with high priority
   (that is higher QoS value) should be processed first.

   The QoS operation is different for the VXLAN gateway processing.  The
   gateway which provides VXLAN tunnel termination functions could be
   ToR/access switches or switches higher up in the data center network
   topology.  For incoming frames on the VXLAN connected interface, the
   gateway strips out the VXLAN header and forwards to a physical port
   based on the destination MAC address of the inner Ethernet frame.  If
   inner VLAN is included in the VXLAN frame or a VLAN is supposed to be
   added based on configuration, the VXLAN gateway decapsulates the
   VXLAN packet and remarks the QoS field of the outgoing Ethernet frame
   based on VXLAN Outer Ethernet Header QoS bits.  The switch SHOULD
   copy the Q-Flags of VXLAN Outer Ethernet Header into IEEE 802.1p
   Priory Code Point (PCP) field in VLAN tag.

6.  Quality of Service Operation at VXLAN encapsulation point

   There are two types of VXLAN packet senders, that is, a VXLAN enabled
   NVE or a VXLAN gateway.

Internet-Draft         Quality of Service Marking          December 2014


   For a VXLAN enabled NVE, the upstream procedure is:

   Reception of Frames

      The VXLAN enabled NVE receives an Ethernet packet from a hosting
      VM.

   Lookup

      Making use of the destination of the Ethernet packet, the VXLAN
      enabled NVE looks up MAC-NVE mapping table, and retrieves IP
      address of destination NVE.

   Acquisition of QoS parameters

      There are two different ways to acquire QoS parameters for VXLAN
      encapsulation.  The first is a dynamic one which requires a VXLAN
      enabled NVE has Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) capability and can
      identify different application types.  The second is a static one
      which requires a VM manager to assign QoS parameters to different
      VNIs based on premium that different tenancies pay.

   Encapsulation of frames

      The NVE then encapsulates the packet using VXLAN format with
      acquired QoS parameters and VNI.  The specific format is given in
      Section 4.  After the frame is encapsulated it is sent out
      upstream to the network.

   For a VXLAN gateway, packets are encapsulated using VXLAN format with
   QoS field in a similar way.  Once the VXLAN gateway receives a packet
   from a non-VXLAN domain, it encapsulates the packet with QoS
   parameters which are acquired through DPI or priorities of tenancies.

7.  QoS processing for VXLAN outer IP header

   QoS is user experience of end-to-end network operation.  A packet
   from VM A to VM B normally traverses such network entities
   sequentially as virtual switch A which is co-located with VM A, TOR
   switch A, aggregation switch A, a core switch, aggregation switch B,
   TOR switch B, virtual switch B.  VXLAN processing only takes place in
   virtual switches, and all other network entities only execute IP
   forwarding.  VXLAN QoS mapping to outer IP header at virtual switch A
   is needed to achieve end-to-end QoS.

   Six bits of the Differentiated Services Field (DS field) are used as
   a codepoint (DSCP) to select the per hop behaviour (PHB) a packet
   experiences at each node in a Differentiated Services Domain

   [RFC2474].  DS field is 8 bits long, 6 bits of it are used as DSCP
   and two bits are unused.  DS field is carried in both IPv4 and IPv6
   packet headers.

   Using 6 bits of DS field, it is possible to define 64 codepoints.  A
   pool of 32 RECOMMENDED codepoints called Pool 1 is standardized by
   IANA. 8 of these 32 codepoints are called class selector (CS)
   codepoints, from CS0 corresponding to '000000' to CS7 corresponding
   to '111000' codepoints.  There are also 12 assured forwarding (AF)
   codepoints [RFC2597], an expedited forwarding (EF) per hop behavior
   [RFC3246]  and VOICE-ADMIT codepoint for capacity-admitted traffic
   [RFC5865].  In this document we use class selector codepoints.  Other
   codepoints are out of scope.

   When a packet forwarded from non-VXLAN domain to VXLAN domain through
   a VXLAN gateway, DSCP field of outer IP header for unicast packets
   should be marked based on VXLAN QoS using the class selector
   codepoints, i.e. 'xxx000' that corresponds to VXLAN QoS marking, i.e.
   with xxx assigned based on static or dynamic QoS markings defined
   above in Section 4.

8.  Security Considerations

   Special security considerations in [RFC7348] are applicable.

9.  IANA considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the Q-Flags bits in VXLAN reserved bits
   in the header.
