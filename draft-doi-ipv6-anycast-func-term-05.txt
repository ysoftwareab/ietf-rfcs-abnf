Abstract

   The purpose of this document is to clarify the usage of terms for
   IPv6 Anycast and help increase its popularity.  This document
   discusses not only Anycasting's terminology but also its
   categorization and clarifies its outline.  In this document, we focus
   on network-layer Anycast, which is defined in IPv6 specifications.

Internet-Draft     IPv6 Anycast Terminology Definition      January 2006


1. Introduction

   In IPv6 networks, a service-oriented address can be assigned to an
   interface called Anycast that identifies a set of interfaces.  A
   packet sent to an Anycast address is delivered to one of the
   interfaces assigned that address.  This interface is the optimum one
   according to some anycast routing mechanisms.

   Since many people are interested in Anycast, it is necessary to
   define Anycast related terms to use them in common.  This document
   will clarify the usage of terms for IPv6 Anycast and support
   documents about IPv6 Anycast.  We focus on network-layer Anycast,
   which is defined in IPv6 specifications [ADDR-ARCH].

2. Definition Format

   Definitions in this document accompany the following format.

3.1 Addresses

   o  Anycast Address (AA)

     Definition:
       An address used for Anycast Communication has already defined in
       [ANYCASTING].

     Discussion:
       This address is a service-oriented address assigned to some
       interfaces.  Nodes to which the same Anycast Address is assigned
       provide the same service.  A packet sent to an Anycast address is
       delivered to one of the interfaces which that address is assigned
       to.

       -  Peer Unicast Address
       -  Anycast Prefix

   o  Anycast Prefix (AP)

     Definition:
       The prefix part of an Anycast Address.

     Discussion:
       Anycast Address is taken from unicast address spaces [ADDR-ARCH].
       An assign method of Anycast Address is different from that of
       unicast address. Anycast Address is not determined by node
       location.  We need to consider what kind of addresses should be
       assigned as the Anycast Address.  The assignment of Anycast

       Address depends on Anycast types (see Section 4).  In Global
       Anycast, a prefix of the Anycast Address equals to the Anycast
       Prefix.

   o  Peer Unicast Address (PUA)

     Definition:
       A unicast address(es) assigned to the interface to which Anycast
       Address is assigned.

     Discussion:
       An Anycast Address can be resolved to a Peer Unicast Address by
       Anycast Address Resolving.

       A Peer Unicast Address assigned to the Correspondent Anycast
       Responder.

3.2 Packet

   o  Anycast Packet

     Definition:
       A packet whose destination address field is filled with an
       Anycast Address.

     Discussion:
       An Anycast Packet is used for Anycast Communication.  When there

       are plural Anycast Responders, one of the Anycast Responders is
       selected to receive an Anycast Packet.

3.3 Node

   o  Anycast Initiator (AI)

     Definition:
       A node that sends an Anycast Packet and initiates Anycast
       Communication.

     Discussion:
       Any node can become an Anycast Initiator.  A node that wants a
       particular service sends an Anycast Packet and becomes an Anycast
       Initiator.  We prefer to use "Initiator" instead of "Client"
       because it is not appropriate to call Anycast Communication
       client-server type communication.  Anycast is basically used for
       a one-shot type communication.

     SeeAlso:
       -  Anycast Communication
       -  Anycast Responder
       -  Correspondent Anycast Responder

   o  Anycast Responder(s) (AR)

     Definition:
       A node that can respond to an Anycast packet.

     Discussion:
       Anycast Responder has an interface(s) assigned to an Anycast
       Address.  Only one Anycast Responder (Correspondent Anycast
       Responder) receives an Anycast Packet sent from an Anycast
       Initiator.

   o  Correspondent Anycast Responder (CAR)

     Definition:
       A node that actually receives an Anycast Packet issued from an
       Anycast Initiator.

     Discussion:
       When an Anycast Initiator sends an Anycast Packet, one of the

       nodes in the Anycast Group Membership is selected based on the
       Anycast Responder Selection Criteria.  The selected node is
       called the Correspondent Anycast Responder.  Even when using the
       same Anycast Responder Selection Criteria, the Correspondent
       Anycast Responder can be changed by Anycast Initiators'
       locations, network conditions, etc.

   o  Home Anycast Responder (HAR)

     Definition:
       An Anycast Responder that can receive Anycast Packets even by
       unicast routing.

     Discussion:
       A Home Anycast Responder is a special Anycast Responder.  Home
       Anycast Responder's Peer Unicast Address equals its Anycast
       Address.

4. Categorization of Anycast

   Anycast is roughly classified into two types (Subnet Anycast and
   Global Anycast) according to locations where Anycast Responders
   exist.

   o  Subnet Anycast (SA)

     Definition:
       An Anycast which use an address whose lower bits are defined by
       Anycast intrinsically.

  |                 n bits                 |      128-n bits        |
  +----------------------------------------+------------------------+
  |   subnet prefix (= segments' prefix)   | anycast intrinsic part |
  +----------------------------------------+------------------------+
                  Fig. 2  Anycast Address for Subnet Anycast

     Discussion:
       An Anycast Address which is used in Subnet Anycast is based on
       the Anycast Responder's unicast address prefix.  In typical case,
       all Anycast Responders are located on the same segment.  Routers
       forward this type of packets only by unicast routing information.
       Some special routing mechanisms are not required. Because a
       prefix of the address is depend on unicast address.  In Subnet
       Anycast, Anycast Packets can reach the last hop router by unicast
       routing.  When the last hop router receives the Anycast Packets,
       the Anycast Responder is determined by the Neighbor Cache [ND] of
       the last hop router.  (i.e., Anycast Responder Selection is up to
       the last hop router.)  Fig. 2 shows Anycast Address format for
       Subnet Anycast and Fig. 3 shows Subnet Anycast.

   o  Global Anycast (GA)

     Definition:
       An Anycast which use an address whose whole bits are defined by
       Anycast.

  |                           128 bits                              |

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
                  Fig. 4  Anycast Address for Global Anycast

     Discussion:
       Unicast routing is useless for this type of addresses.  Because
       unicast address is not used for this address at all.  Some
       special Anycast Routing mechanisms are necessary to achieve
       Global Anycast communications.  Fig. 4 shows Anycast Address
       format for Global Anycast and Fig. 5 shows Global Anycast.
       In special cases, Subnet Anycast and Global Anycast are combined.
       In such cases, an Anycast Packet is delivered to the last hop
       router by Anycast Routing, which then delivers the Anycast Packet
       according to its Neighbor Cache.  An Anycast in this case is
       shown in Fig. 6.
