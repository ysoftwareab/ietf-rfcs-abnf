Abstract

   IP packets (both IPv4 and IPv6) are understood to contain a unit of
   data which becomes the retransmission unit in case of loss.  Upper
   layer protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   prepare data units known as "segments", with traditional arrangements
   including a single segment per packet.  This document presents a new
   construct known as the "IP Parcel" which permits a single packet to
   carry multiple segments, essentially creating a "packet-of-packets".
   IP parcels provide an essential building block for accommodating
   larger Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) in the Internet as discussed
   in this document.

1.  Introduction

   IP packets (both IPv4 [RFC0791] and IPv6 [RFC8200]) are understood to
   contain a unit of data which becomes the retransmission unit in case
   of loss.  Upper layer protocols such as the Transmission Control
   Protocol (TCP) [RFC0793], QUIC [RFC9000], LTP [RFC5326] and others
   prepare data units known as "segments", with traditional arrangements
   including a single segment per packet.  This document presents a new
   construct known as the "IP Parcel" which permits a single packet to
   carry multiple segments.  This essentially creates a "packet-of-
   packets" with the IP layer headers appearing only once but with
   possibly multiple upper layer protocol segments.

   Parcels are formed when an upper layer protocol entity (identified by
   the "5-tuple" source IP address/port number, destination IP address/
   port number and protocol number) prepares a buffer of data with the
   concatenation of up to 64 properly-formed segments that can be broken
   out into smaller parcels using a copy of the IP header.  All segments
   except the final segment must be equal in size and no larger than
   65535 octets (minus headers), while the final segment must be no
   larger than the others but may be smaller.  The upper layer protocol
   entity then delivers the buffer and non-final segment size to the IP
   layer, which appends the necessary IP headers to identify this as a
   parcel and not an ordinary packet.

   Each original parcel can traverse arbitrarily many parcel-capable IP
   links in the path until arriving at a parcel-capable ingress
   middlebox at the edge of a wide area Internetwork.  The ingress
   middlebox may break the parcel out into smaller (sub-)parcels and
   encapsulate them in headers suitable for traversing the Internetwork.
   These smaller parcels may then be rejoined into one or more larger
   parcels at an egress middlebox which forwards them further over
   parcel-capable IP links toward the final destination.  Repackaging of
   parcels is therefore commonplace, while reordering of segments within
   a parcel or even loss of individual segments is possible but not
   desirable.  But, what matters is that the number of parcels delivered
   to the final destination should be kept to a minimum, and that loss
   or receipt of individual segments (and not parcel size) determines
   the retransmission unit.

   The following sections discuss rationale for creating and shipping
   parcels as well as the actual protocol constructs and procedures
   involved.  IP parcels provide an essential building block for
   accommodating larger Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) in the
   Internet.  It is further expected that the parcel concept may drive
   future innovation in applications, operating systems, network
   equipment and data links.

2.  Terminology

   A "parcel" is defined as "a thing or collection of things wrapped in
   paper in order to be carried or sent by mail".  Indeed, there are
   many examples of parcel delivery services worldwide that provide an
   essential transit backbone for efficient business and consumer
   transactions.

   In this same spirit, an "IP parcel" is simply a collection of up to
   64 upper layer protocol segments wrapped in an efficient package for
   transmission and delivery (i.e., a "packet of packets") while a
   "singleton IP parcel" is simply a parcel that contains a single
   segment.  IP parcels are distinguished from ordinary packets through
   the special header constructions discussed in this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Background and Motivation

   Studies have shown that by sending and receiving larger packets
   applications can realize greater performance due to reduced numbers
   of system calls and interrupts as well as larger atomic data copies
   between kernel and user space.  Large packets in the network also
   result in reduced numbers of device interrupts and better network
   utilization in comparison with smaller packet sizes.

   A first study [QUIC] involved performance enhancement of the QUIC
   protocol [RFC9000] using the linux Generic Segment/Receive Offload
   (GSO/GRO) facility.  GSO/GRO provide a robust (but non-standard)
   service very similar in nature to the IP parcel service described
   here, and its application has shown significant performance increases
   due to the increased transfer unit size between the operating system
   kernel and QUIC application.

   A second study [I-D.templin-dtn-ltpfrag] showed that GSO/GRO also
   improved performance for the Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP)
   [RFC5326] for small- to medium-sized segments.  Historically, the NFS
   protocol also saw significant performance increases using larger
   (single-segment) UDP datagrams even when IP fragmentation is invoked,
   and LTP still follows this profile today.  Moreover, LTP shows this
   (single-segment) performance increase profile extending to the
   largest possible segment size which suggests that additional
   performance gains may be possible using (multi-segment) IP parcels
   that exceed 65535 octets.

   TCP also benefits from larger packet sizes and efforts have
   investigated TCP performance using jumbograms internally with changes
   to the linux GSO/GRO facilities [BIG-TCP].  The idea is to use the
   jumbo payload internally and to allow GSO and GRO to use buffer sizes
   larger than 65535 octets, but with the understanding that links that
   support jumbos natively are not yet widely available.  Hence, IP
   parcels provides a packaging that can be considered in the near term
   under current deployment limitations.

   The issue with sending large packets is that they are often lost at
   links with smaller Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs), and the
   resulting Packet Too Big (PTB) message may be lost somewhere in the
   path back to the original source.  This "Path MTU black hole"
   condition can degrade performance unless robust path probing
   techniques are used, however the best case performance always occurs
   when no packets are lost due to size restrictions.

   These considerations therefore motivate a design where the maximum
   segment size should be no larger than 65535 octets (minus headers),
   while parcels that carry the segments may themselves be significantly
   larger.  Then, even if a middlebox needs to sub-divide the parcels
   into smaller sub-parcels to forward further toward the final
   destination, an important performance optimization for both the
   original source and final destination can be realized.

   An analogy: when a consumer orders 50 small items from a major online
   retailer, the retailer does not ship the order in 50 separate small
   boxes.  Instead, the retailer puts as many of the small boxes as
   possible into one or a few larger boxes (or parcels) then places the
   parcels on a semi-truck or airplane.  The parcels arrive at a
   regional distribution center where they may be further redistributed
   into slightly smaller parcels that get delivered to the consumer.
   But most often, the consumer will only find one or a few parcels at
   his doorstep and not 50 individual boxes.  This greatly reduces
   handling overhead for both the retailer and consumer.

4.  IP Parcel Formation

   IP parcel formation is invoked by an upper layer protocol (identified
   by the 5-tuple as above) when it emits a data buffer containing the
   concatenation of up to 64 segments.  All non-final segments MUST be
   equal in length while the final segment MUST NOT be larger but MAY be
   smaller.  Each non-final segment MUST be no larger than 65535 octets
   minus the length of the IP header plus extensions, minus the length
   of an additional IPv6 header in case an encapsulation middlebox is
   visited on the path (see: Section 5).  The upper layer protocol then
   presents the buffer and non-final segment size to the IP layer which
   appends a single IP header (plus any extension headers) before

   presenting the parcel to either the adaptation layer or the outgoing
   network interface itself (see: Section 5).

   For IPv4, the IP layer prepares the parcel by appending an IPv4
   header with a Jumbo Payload option formed as follows:

   +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
   |00001011|00000110|       Jumbo Payload Length        |
   +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

   where option type is set to '00001011' and option length is set to
   '00000110' which distinguishes the option from its former
   (deprecated) use as "IPv4 Probe MTU" by [RFC1063]).  In this new
   format, "Jumbo Payload Length" is a 32-bit unsigned integer value (in
   network byte order) set to the lengths of the IPv4 header plus all
   concatenated segments.  The IP layer next sets the IPv4 header DF bit
   to 1, then sets the IPv4 header Total Length field to the length of
   the IPv4 header plus the length of the first segment only.  Note that
   the IP layer can form true IPv4 jumbograms (as opposed to parcels) by
   instead setting the IPv4 header Total Length field to the length of
   the IPv4 header plus options (see: Section 9).

   For IPv6, the IP layer forms a parcel by appending an IPv6 header
   with a Jumbo Payload option [RFC2675] the same as for IPv4 above with
   option type set to '11000010' and option length set to '00000100'
   where "Jumbo Payload Length" is set to the lengths of the IPv6 Hop-
   by-Hop Options header and any other extension headers present plus
   all concatenated segments.  The IP layer next sets the IPv6 header
   Payload Length field to the lengths of the IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options
   header and any other extension headers present plus the length of the
   first segment only.  As with IPv4 the IP layer can form true IPv6
   jumbograms (as opposed to parcels) by instead setting the IPv6 header
   Payload Length field to 0 (see: [RFC2675]).

   An IP parcel therefore has the following structure:

   |     IP Header Plus Extensions     |
   ~    {Total, Payload} Length = M    ~
   |      Jumbo Payload Length = N     |
   +--------+--------+--------+--------+

   where J is the total number of segments (between 1 and 64), L is the
   length of each non-final segment which MUST NOT be larger than 65535
   octets (minus headers as above) and K is the length of the final
   segment which MUST NOT be larger than L.  The values M and N are then
   set to the length of the IP header plus extensions for IPv4 or to the
   length of the extensions only for IPv6, then further calculated as
   follows:

      M = M + ((J-1) ? L : K)

      N = N + (((J-1) * L) + K)

   Note: a "singleton" parcel is one that includes only the IP header
   plus extensions with a single segment of length K, while a "null"
   parcel is a singleton with K=0, i.e., a parcel consisting of only the
   IP header plus extensions with no octets beyond.

5.  Transmission of IP Parcels

   The IP layer next presents the parcel to the outgoing network
   interface.  For ordinary IP interfaces, the IP layer simply forwards
   the parcel over the underlying link the same as for any IP packet
   after which it may then be forwarded by any number of routers over
   additional parcel-capable IP links.  If any next hop IP link in the
   path either does not support parcels or configures an MTU that is too
   small to transit the parcel without fragmentation, the router instead
   opens the parcel and forwards each enclosed segment as a separate IP
   packet (i.e., by appending a copy of the parcel's IP header to each
   segment but with the Jumbo Payload option removed according to the
   standards [RFC0791][RFC8200]).  Or, if the router does not recognize
   parcels at all, it drops the parcel and (for IPv6) may return an ICMP
   "Parameter Problem" message according to [RFC2675].

   If the outgoing network interface is an OMNI interface
   [I-D.templin-6man-omni], the OMNI Adaptation Layer (OAL) of this
   First Hop Segment (FHS) OAL node forwards the parcel to the next OAL
   hop which may be either an OAL intermediate node or the Last Hop
   Segment (LHS) OAL node (which may also be the final destination
   itself).  The OAL assigns a monotonically- incrementing (modulo 127)
   "Parcel ID" and subdivides the parcel into sub-parcels no larger than
   the maximum of the path MTU to the next hop or 65535 octets (minus
   the length of encapsulation headers) by determining the number of
   segments of length L that can fit into each sub-parcel under these
   size constraints.  For example, if the OAL determines that a sub-
   parcel can contain 3 segments of length L, it creates sub-parcels
   with the first containing segments 1-3, the second containing
   segments 4-6, etc. and with the final containing any remaining
   segments.  The OAL then appends an identical IP header plus
   extensions to each sub-parcel while resetting M and N in each
   according to the above equations with J set to 3 and K set to L for
   each non-final sub-parcel and with J set to the remaining number of
   segments for the final sub-parcel.

   The OAL next performs IP encapsulation on each sub-parcel with
   destination set to the next hop IP address then inserts an IPv6
   Fragment Header after the IP encapsulation header, i.e., even if the
   encapsulation header is IPv4, even if no actual fragmentation is
   needed and/or even if the Jumbo Payload option is present.  The OAL
   then assigns a randomly-initialized 32-bit Identification number that
   is monotonically-incremented for each consecutive sub-parcel, then
   performs IPv6 fragmentation over the sub-parcel if necessary to
   create fragments small enough to traverse the path to the next OAL
   hop while writing the Parcel ID and setting or clearing the "Parcel
   (P)" and "(More) Sub-Parcels (S)" bits in the Fragment Header of the
   first fragment (see: [I-D.templin-6man-fragrep]).  (The OAL sets P to

Internet-Draft                 IP Parcels                  February 2022


   1 for a parcel or to 0 for a non-parcel.  When P is 1, the OAL next
   sets S to 1 for non-final sub-parcels or to 0 if the sub-parcel
   contains the final segment.)  The OAL then forwards each IP
   encapsulated packet/fragment to the next OAL hop.

   When the next OAL hop receives the encapsulated IP fragments or whole
   packets, it reassembles if necessary.  If the P flag in the first
   fragment is 0, the next hop then processes the reassembled entity as
   an ordinary IP packet; otherwise it continues processing as a sub-
   parcel.  If the next hop is an OAL intermediate node, it retains the
   sub-parcels along with their Parcel ID and Identification values for
   a brief time in hopes of re-combining with peer sub-parcels of the
   same original parcel identified by the 4-tuple consisting of the IP
   encapsulation source and destination, Identification and Parcel ID.
   The combining entails the concatenation of the segments included in
   sub-parcels with the same Parcel ID and with Identification values
   within 64 of one another to create a larger sub-parcel possibly even
   as large as the entire original parcel.  Order of concatenation is
   not important, with the exception that the final sub-parcel (i.e.,
   the one with S set to 0) must occur as the final concatenation before
   transmission.  The OAL then appends a common IP header plus
   extensions to each re-combined sub-parcel while resetting M and N in
   each according to the above equations with J, K and L set
   accordingly.

   This OAL intermediate node next forwards the re-combined sub-
   parcel(s) to the next hop toward the LHS OAL node using encapsulation
   the same as specified above.  (The intermediate node MUST ensure that
   the S flag remains set to 0 in the sub-parcel that contains the final
   segment.)  When the parcel or sub-parcels arrive at the LHS OAL node,
   the OAL re-combines them into the largest possible sub-parcels while
   honoring the S flag.  If the LHS OAL node is also the final
   destination, it delivers the sub-parcels to upper layers which act on
   the enclosed 5-tuple information supplied by the original source.  If
   the LHS OAL node is not the final destination, it instead forwards
   each sub-parcel the same as for an ordinary IP packet the same as
   discussed above.

   Note: while the LHS OAL node may be tempted to re-combine the sub-
   parcels of multiple different parcels with identical upper layer
   protocol 5-tuples and with non-final segments of identical length,
   this process could become complicated when the different parcels each
   have final segments of diverse lengths.  Since this might interfere
   with any perceived performance advantages, the decision of whether
   and how to perform inter-parcel concatenation is an implementation
   matter.

   Note: some IPv6 fragmentation and reassembly implementations may
   require a well-formed IPv6 header to perform their operations.  When
   the encapsulation is based on IPv4, such implementations translate
   the encapsulation header into an IPv6 header with IPv4-Mapped IPv6
   addresses before performing the fragmentation/reassembly operation,
   then restore the original IPv4 header before further processing.

6.  Parcel Path Qualification

   To determine whether parcels are supported over at least a leading
   portion of the forward path toward the final destination, the
   original source can send a singleton IP parcel formatted as a "Parcel
   Probe" that contains an upper layer protocol probe segment (e.g., a
   data segment, an ICMP Echo Request message, etc.).  The purpose of
   the probe is to elicit a "Parcel Reply" and possibly also an ordinary
   upper layer protocol probe reply from the final destination.

   If the original source receives a positive Parcel Reply, it marks the
   path as "parcels supported" and ignores any ICMP [RFC0792][RFC4443]
   and/or Packet Too Big (PTB) messages [RFC1191][RFC8201] concerning
   the probe.  If the original source instead receives a negative Parcel
   Reply or no reply, it marks the path as "parcels not supported" and
   may regard any ICMP and/or PTB messages concerning the probe (or its
   contents) as indications of a possible middlebox restriction.

   The original source can therefore send Parcel Probes in parallel with
   sending real data as ordinary IP packets.  If the original source
   receives a positive Parcel Reply, it can begin using IP parcels.

   Parcel Probes use the IP parcel option type (see: Section 4) but set
   a different option length and replace the option value with control
   information plus a 4-octet "Path MTU" value into which conformant
   middleboxes write the minimum link MTU observed the same as described
   in [RFC1063][I-D.ietf-6man-mtu-option].  Parcel Probes can also
   include an upper layer protocol probe segment the same as described
   in [RFC4821][RFC8899].

   The original source sends Parcel Probes unidirectionally in the
   forward path toward the final destination to elicit a Parcel Reply,
   since it will often be the case that IP parcels are supported only in
   the forward path and not in the return path.  Parcel Probes may be
   dropped in the forward path by any node that does not recognize IP
   parcels, but a Parcel Reply must be packaged such that it will not be
   dropped even if IP parcels are not recognized in the return path.

   Original sources send Parcel Probes using the following option
   format:

   For IPv4, the original source MUST set Type to '00001011' and Length
   to '00001110' - this is the same Type as for an ordinary IPv4 parcel
   (see: Section 4) but with a different Length.  The original source
   then MUST set Nonce-1 to 0xffff, set Nonce-2 to a (pseudo)-random
   32-bit value and set Reserved to 0.  The original source finally MUST
   set Check to the same value that will appear in the TTL of the
   outgoing IPv4 header and MUST set PMTU to the MTU of the outgoing
   IPv4 interface.  The original source finally sends the Parcel Probe
   over the outgoing IPv4 interface.  According to [RFC7126],
   middleboxes (i.e., routers, security gateways, firewalls, etc.) that
   do not observe this specification SHOULD drop IP packets that contain
   option type '00001011' ("IPv4 Probe MTU") but some might instead
   either implement [RFC1063] or ignore the option altogether.  IPv4
   middleboxes that observe this specification instead MUST process the
   option as a Parcel Probe as specified below.

   For IPv6, the original source MUST set Type to '11000010' and Length
   to '00001100' - this is the same Type as for an ordinary IPv6 parcel
   (see: Section 4) but with a different Length.  The original source
   then MUST set both Nonce-1 and Nonce-2 to a (pseudo)-random 48-bit
   value and set Reserved to 0.  The original source finally MUST set
   Check to the same value that will appear in the Hop Limit of the
   outgoing IPv6 header and MUST set PMTU to the MTU of the outgoing
   IPv6 interface.  The original source finally sends the Parcel Probe
   over the outgoing IPv6 interface.  According to [RFC2675],
   middleboxes (i.e., routers, security gateways, firewalls, etc.) that
   understand the IPv6 Jumbo Payload option are required to detect a
   number of possible format errors and return an ICMPv6 Parameter
   Problem message, but no guidance is given regarding forwarding.  IPv6
   middleboxes that observe this specification instead MUST process the
   option as a Parcel Probe as specified below.

   When a middlebox that observes this specification receives a Parcel
   Probe it first compares the Check value with the IP header Hop Limit/
   TTL; if the values differ, the middlebox MUST return a negative
   Parcel Reply (see below) and drop the probe.

   Next, if the next hop IP link either does not support parcels or
   configures an MTU that is too small to pass the parcel, the middlebox
   compares the Parcel Probe PMTU value with the MTU of the inbound link
   for the probe and MUST (re)set PMTU to the lower MTU.  The middlebox
   then MUST return a positive Parcel Reply (see below) and convert the
   probe into an ordinary IP packet by removing the Parcel Probe option
   according to the standards [RFC0791][RFC8200].  If the next hop IP
   link configures a sufficiently large MTU, the middlebox then MUST
   forward the ordinary IP packet to the next hop; otherwise, it MUST
   drop the packet and should return a suitable PTB.

   If the next hop IP link both supports parcels and configures an MTU
   that is large enough to pass the parcel, the middlebox instead
   compares the Parcel Probe PMTU value with the MTUs of both the
   inbound and outbound links for the probe and MUST (re)set PMTU to the
   lower MTU.  The middlebox then MUST reset Check to the same value
   that will appear in the TTL/Hop Limit of the outgoing IP header, and
   MUST forward the Parcel Probe to the next hop.

   The final destination may therefore receive either an ordinary IP
   packet containing an upper layer protocol probe or a Parcel Probe.
   If the final destination receives an ordinary IP packet, it performs
   any necessary integrity checks then delivers the packet to upper
   layers which will return an upper layer probe response.  If the final
   destination instead receives a Parcel Probe, it first compares the
   Check value with the IP header Hop Limit/TTL; if the values differ,
   the final destination MUST drop the probe and return a negative
   Parcel Reply (see below).  Otherwise, the final destination compares
   the Parcel Probe PMTU value with the MTU of the inbound link for the
   probe and MUST (re)set PMTU to the lower MTU.  The final destination
   then MUST return a positive Parcel Reply (see below) and convert the
   probe into an ordinary IP packet by removing the Parcel Probe option
   according to the standards [RFC0791][RFC8200].The final destination
   then performs any necessary integrity checks and delivers the packet
   to upper layers.

   When the middlebox or final destination returns a Parcel Reply, it
   prepares an IP header of the same protocol version that appeared in
   the Parcel Probe with source and destination addresses reversed, with
   {Protocol, Next Header} set to the value '60' (i.e., "IPv6
   Destination Option") and with an IPv6 Destination Option header with
   Next Header set to the value '59' (i.e., "IPv6 No Next Header")
   [RFC8200].  The node next copies the body of the Parcel Probe option
   as the sole Parcel Reply Destination Option (and for IPv4 resets Type
   to '11000010' and Length to '00001100') and includes no other octets
   beyond the end of the option.  The node then MUST (re)set Check to 1
   for a positive or to 0 for a negative Parcel Reply, then MUST finally
   set the IP header {Total, Payload} Length field according to the

   length of the included Destination Option and return the Parcel Reply
   to the source.  (Since filtering middleboxes may drop IPv4 packets
   with Protocol '60' the destination should wrap an IPv4 Parcel Reply
   in UDP/IPv4 headers with the IPv4 source and destination addresses
   copied from the Parcel Reply and with UDP port numbers set to the UDP
   port number for OMNI [I-D.templin-6man-omni].)

   After sending a Parcel Probe the original source may therefore
   receive a Parcel Reply (see above) and/or an upper layer protocol
   probe reply.  If the source receives a Parcel Reply, it first matches
   Nonce-2 (and for IPv6 only also matches Nonce-1) with the values it
   had included in the Parcel Probe.  If the values do not match, the
   source discards the Parcel Reply.  Next, the source examines the
   Check value and marks the path as "parcels supported" if the value is
   1 or "parcels not supported" otherwise.  If the source marks the path
   as "parcels supported", it also records the PMTU value as the maximum
   parcel size for the forward path to this destination.

   After receiving a positive Parcel Reply, the original source can
   begin sending IP parcels up to the size recorded in the PMTU to the
   final destination.  Any upper layer protocol probe replies will
   determine the maximum segment size that can be included in the
   parcel, but this is an upper layer consideration.  The original
   source should then periodically re-initiate Parcel Path Qualification
   as long as its session with the final destination is sustained (i.e.,
   in case the forward path fluctuates).  If at any time performance
   appears to degrade, the original source should immediately re-
   initiate Parcel Path Qualification.

7.  Integrity

   Each segment of a (multi-segment) IP parcel includes its own upper
   layer protocol integrity check.  This allows for IP parcels to
   support much stronger integrity for the same amount of upper layer
   protocol data in comparison with an ordinary IP packet or Jumbogram
   containing only a single segment.  The integrity checks must then be
   verified at the final destination, which accepts any segments with
   correct integrity while discarding any corrupted segments and
   counting them as a loss event.

   IP parcels can range in length from as small as only the IP header
   sizes to as large as the IP headers plus (64 * (65535 minus headers))
   octets.  Although link layer integrity checks provide sufficient
   protection for contiguous data blocks up to approximately 9KB,
   reliance on the presence of link-layer integrity checks may not be
   possible over links such as tunnels.  Moreover, the segment contents
   of a received parcel may arrive in an incomplete and/or rearranged
   order with respect to their original packaging.

   For these reasons, the OAL at each hop of an OMNI link includes an
   integrity check when it performs IP fragmentation on a sub-parcel,
   with the integrity verified during reassembly at the next hop.

8.  RFC2675 Updates

   Section 3 of [RFC2675] provides a list of certain conditions to be
   considered as errors.  In particular:

      error: IPv6 Payload Length != 0 and Jumbo Payload option present

      error: Jumbo Payload option present and Jumbo Payload Length <
      65,536

   Implementations that obey this specification ignore these conditions
   and do not consider them as errors.

9.  IPv4 Jumbograms

   By defining a new IPv4 Jumbo Payload option, this document also
   implicitly enables an IPv4 jumbogram service defined as an IPv4
   packet with Total Length set to the length of the IPv4 header plus
   extensions only, and with a Jumbo Payload option in the IPv4
   extension headers.  All other aspects of IPv4 jumbograms are the same
   as for IPv6 jumbograms [RFC2675].

10.  Implementation Status

   Common widely-deployed implementations include services such as TCP
   Segmentation Offload (TSO) and Generic Segmentation/Receive Offload
   (GSO/GRO).  These services support a robust (but not standardized)
   service that has been shown to improve performance in many instances.
   Implementation of the IP parcel service is a work in progress.

11.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is instructed to change the "MTUP - MTU Probe" entry in the
   'ip option numbers' registry to the "JUMBO - IPv4 Jumbo Payload"
   option.  The Copy and Class fields must both be set to 0, and the
   Number and Value fields must both be set to 11'.  The reference must
   be changed to this document (RFCXXXX).

12.  Security Considerations

   Original sources match the Jumbo Payload Length and Nonce values in
   received Parcel Replies with the Parcel Probes they send.  If the
   values match, the Parcel Reply is likely an authentic response to the
   Parcel Probe.  In environments where stronger authentication is
   necessary, the encapsulating authentication services of OMNI can be
   used [I-D.templin-6man-omni].

   Communications networking security is necessary to preserve
   confidentiality, integrity and availability.

13.  Acknowledgements

   This work was inspired by ongoing AERO/OMNI/DTN investigations.  The
   concepts were further motivated through discussions on the intarea
   and 6man lists.

   A considerable body of work over recent years has produced useful
   "segmentation offload" facilities available in widely-deployed
   implementations.
