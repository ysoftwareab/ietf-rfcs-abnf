  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> The Internet-Standard Management Framework</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines objects for managing information about a Bundle Node [RFC5050] - or simply a 'Node' within the scope of this document.  More specifically, the manageable objects for such a Node include: Node- Specific information, registered Endpoint-Specific information, and generic CLA-Specific (Convergence Layer Adapter) information.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> Requirements Language</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> <a href="#overview" id="overview">Overview</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">The Bundle Protocol (BP) [RFC5050] was designed as part of the solution to issues encountered in Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) environments [RFC4838], which are otherwise unresolvable by the connection-oriented scheme used in today's Internet.  This memo contains the definitions for a Bundle Protocol MIB as well as rationale for certain implementation decisions.  Also contained in this memo is a section dedicated to considerations for future designers of DTN-related MIBs.  The MIB module defined in this memo contains object definitions for a single Node, for each Endpoints of which that Node is a member, and for the CLAs which that Node has access to use.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.1">4.1.</a> Structure of the MIB</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">Objects within the BP-MIB have been derived from RFC 5050 [RFC5050] or were designed to be used in the management of a BP Node, but are not explicitly derived from RFC 5050 [RFC5050].  These objects are broken down into three main groups: </p>

<ul>
<li>Node-Specific Definitions</li>
<li>Endpoint-Specific Definitions</li>
<li>CLA-Specific Definitions</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.1.1">4.1.1.</a> <a href="#nodeSpecific" id="nodeSpecific">Node-Specific Definitions</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.1">Within this document, objects that are referred to as 'Node-Specific' are those objects which relate only to the Node being managed.  In other words, these objects do not relate to a Node's relationship with any other entity (i.e.  Endpoints and CLAs).  Node-Specific objects include: </p>

<ul>
<li>A unique name given to the Node Instance (bpNodeID)</li>
<li>The last time a Node was restarted (bpLastUpTime)</li>
<li>The number of locally generated Bundles for each priority type (bpBulkPriorGen, bpNormPriorGen, and bpExpPriorGen)</li>
<li>The number of locally queued Bundles for each priority type (bpBulkPriorQueued, bpNormPriorQueued, and bpExpPriorQueued)</li>
<li>The number of locally queued Bundles for each type of retention constraint (bpReassemblyPending, bpDispatchPending, bpForwardPending, and bpCustodyAccepted)</li>
<li>The number of reports received by this Node for each of the report types (bpBundleReceptions, bpBundleAcceptance, bpBundleForwarding, bpCustodySuccess, and bpBundleDelivery) and</li>
<li>The number of times this Node took a specific action on (or failed to take action on) Bundles.  Specifically, these actions involve: custody acceptance, forwarding, abandoning, discarding, deletion (for each or the reasons specified in RFC 5050 [RFC5050]), and fragmenting (bpCustodyFailure, bpForwardFailure, bpAbandonedDelivery, bpDiscardedBundles, bpFragmentedLocally, bpDelExpired, bpDelTransCancelled, bpDelDepStorage, bpDelDestUnintel, bpDelNoRoute, bpDelUntimelyContact, bpDelBlockUnintel, AND bpDelNoAdditionalInfo)</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.1.p.2">Each of these objects are detailed more precisely in the MIB's description fields.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.1.2">4.1.2.</a> <a href="#endpointSpecific" id="endpointSpecific">Endpoint-Specific Definitions</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.2.p.1">Within this document, objects that are referred to as 'Endpoint- Specific' are those objects which relate to a specific Endpoint in respect to the managed Node.  In other words, the information managed by these objects are subject only to the Node's view of the Endpoint (e.g. the current state of the Endpoint is "active" according to this Node OR the number of Bundles this Node has received through this Endpoint is 42).  Endpoint-Specific objects are maintained within a conceptual table (with the exception of bpRegCount).  The following objects fall under this category: </p>

<ul>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.1">The first design decision involved the overall representation of Nodes and their respective attributes.  According to section 3.1 of RFC 5050 [RFC5050], Nodes have a M:N relationship with Endpoints.  That is to say, a Node can be a member of multiple Endpoints and (as long as it is not a Singleton Endpoint) an Endpoint can have multiple Nodes register it.  Since SMIv2 [RFC2578] does not allow for the creation of three-dimensional conceptual tables, a normalized view of this relationship would require a mediating table or a method of simulating a three-dimensional conceptual table.  The method used here, as exhibited in section 5 of this document, was to simulate a three-dimensional conceptual table by having each instance of the BP-MIB contain managed information for a single Node - with each instance having a conceptual table that contains managed information for each Endpoint of which the Node is a member.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2.2">4.2.2.</a> <a href="#claDesign" id="claDesign">Convergence Layer Adapters</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.1">With the Node/Endpoint decision made, the next decision involved the representation of CLAs.  Since multiple Nodes can share the use of CLAs, and since the characteristics of a CLA are implementation dependent, few objects were placed within the bpClaTable.  Since it is likely that a CLA's managed objects (those stored in a MIB designed specifically for the management of the given CLA type) will maintain more specific information than that contained in the bpClaTable, two objects were created as a way to reference a CLA's MIB instance.  These two objects are: </p>

<ul>
<li>bpClType - Identifies the type of Convergence Layer (CL) being used by the CLA (e.g.  UDP, TCP, LTP, or otherwise)</li>
<li>bpClID - Uniquely identifies the instance of managed information for the underlying CL whose type is defined by bpClType</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.2">The bpClType and bpClId objects are also used as a solution to a specific design goal.  This goal involves the ability to trace managed information down the protocol stack and is discussed in more detail in section 4.2.3 of this document.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2.3">4.2.3.</a> <a href="#stackDesign" id="stackDesign">Managing the Protocol Stack</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.1">One of this MIB's primary goals is to enable managed information to be traceable throughout the protocol stack.  Ultimately, this goal is achieved by creating either a direct or indirect reference to an entry in the ifTable [RFC2863].  To make this possible, the BP-MIB MUST have identifier(s) that can be used to reference the MIB instance of the layer beneath itself. The BP-MIB is designed in such a way that both direct and indirect references to an ifTable entry can be achieved. This was done by placing two objects within the bpClaTable: one that uniquely identifies the CL type (bpClType) and one that uniquely identifies an instance of managed information for the given type (bpClID). Direct references to an ifTable entry are achieved by setting bpClType = 1 (which means it is referring to an interface). Indirect references are achieved when referencing a CLA MIB which, in turn, references the layer beneath itself.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.2">bpClType SHOULD be a standardized numeric value that identifies the type of Convergence Layer being used by the Convergence Layer Adapter.  This object is discussed more in section 4.2.4 of this document; giving rationale to the need for number standardization.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.3">bpClID, alternatively, is an arbitrary value chosen by the agent that uniquely identifies an instance of the MIB whose type is given by bpClType.  The NMS responsible for the managed information can use this value to determine the OID of the desired CLA.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.4">Currently, the MIB module defines the bpClType object to be an integer.  This design decision needs reconsideration however.  For readability and ease of use, a textual-convention would likely be a better choice for the object syntax.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.5">There are two objects in the bpClaTable that represent the number of Bundles passed into the BPA and out through the underlying CL (bpClInBndls and bpClOutBndls).  Though these values are not used for stack traversal, they are maintained as a way of offering a view of Bundle activity to/from the BP layer for each CLA.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.4.p.1">In sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 of this document, the use of bpClType was discussed. Using such an object, however, could result in inconsistencies across implementations of BP software.  To avoid this, the BP-MIB uses a pre-defined set of numeric values, each uniquely representing a CL type.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.5.p.1">The value in knowing the direction of data flow can be found in the use of certain equipment types.  Satellites, for instance, are prone to utilizing an up-link that is different from the down-link.  Scenarios similar to this are likely to result in the creation of two separate CLA MIB instances - one for each link.  In these cases, a manager might desire knowing whether the underlying CL is capable of transmitting unidirectional traffic or bidirectional traffic.  To represent this, the bpClaTable has been given the bpClaDirection object.  The possible settings are inBound, outBound or biDirectional.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.6.p.1">In an attempt to keep things modular, TRAP and INFORM objects have been left out of the BP-MIB.  These objects SHOULD be designed in a separate MIB module which, if used, MUST be implemented in conjunction with the BP-MIB.  Since the requirements of network management within a DTN are distinct from those in a timely environment, use of notifications might vary between DTN environments and timely environments.  With this in mind, careful consideration SHOULD be made when designing such objects. This is discussed in more detail in section 4.3.3 of this document.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.7.p.1">Certain MIBs, such as those that manage high performance equipment, might contain mechanisms to store local data trends and simple statistical analysis. Though DTNs aren't typically found in environments that require high-performance equipment, the need for such mechanisms might exist due to delay-related restraints.  However, in an attempt to keep things modular, statistic-based objects and trending objects have been considered beyond the scope of the BP-MIB.  These objects, if any such objects are designed, SHOULD be put in a separate MIB module which MAY be implemented in conjunction with the BP-MIB, but can function independent of the BP-MIB. Design considerations for local trending and statistical analysis are addressed in section 4.3.1 of this document.</p>

Section 4.3.1 gives a generic overview of DTN-related network management concepts and how they might apply to the design of DTN-related MIBs. Sections 4.3.2 through 4.3.4 observe particular MIB types and describe how they can and SHOULD inter-relate with the BP-MIB.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">Though it's beyond the scope of this document to discuss DTN network management requirements, certain DTN network management issues SHOULD be considered in the design of DTN-related MIBs.

<p id="rfc.section.4.3.1.p.1">DTN-related MIB designers SHOULD consider the environment(s) under which the MIB might be deployed. Environment, as used here, refers to elements like: the storage capacity and processing power of the equipment being used; the frequency at which values might change in relation to the frequency at which they can be transmitted to an NMS; existing network management protocol capabilities and; whether best practices in timely networks apply or if distinctions ought to be made. Additionally, designers SHOULD consider the level of diversity that potential environments might have from one another. Not doing so limits scalability and increases complexity for future designers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.1.p.2">In Delay / Disruption prone environments, high latency and periodic disconnection are likely to occur. With this in mind, designers SHOULD use object types that reflect an object's nature - in regard to how frequently that object might change (e.g. how often a counter might roll back to 0). Designers SHOULD also consider that certain desirable statistics or trends might be impossible to calculate in the same way they could be in a timely environment. This might result in the need to calculate and store vsuch values on the managed entity. Careful consideration SHOULD be given before using a MIB-based solution to this issue. Not doing so limits scalability and increases complexity for future designers.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.3.2.p.1">As described in sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3, Convergence Layer Adapter MIBs will be needed for the management of information beyond what is offered by bpClaTable.  This section addresses the design of those MIBs and offers suggestions to the designers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.2.p.2">Within the BP-MIB, the bpClaTable contains objects for each CLA the Node currently has access to. Within this table, two objects were defined as a reference to the underlying CLA's managed objects. These objects (bpClType and bpClID) were described in detail in sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3. This document RECOMMENDS that the design of CLA MIBs follow a similar pattern in order to preserve the goal of managing the protocol stack. To achieve this, two things MUST be done on the part of the designer. First, an object whose value can be referenced by bpClID needs to be placed somewhere within the CLA's MIB.  This object MUST be assigned an arbitrary, but unique, value for each instance of the object - however, the maintenance of uniqueness might be subject to software implementation rather than in the design of the MIB.  Second, object(s) that can be used to reference the layer beneath the CLA need to be created.  The exact method of doing this is beyond the scope of this document.</p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.3.p.1">Design of DTN-related TRAP and INFORM objects SHOULD take into account the environment(s) under which they might be deployed.  The level of variance one environment's conditions have to others' can be arbitrarily small or large. For instance, delay, in one environment, could refer to a relatively short time span, such as 5 minutes, whereas other environments might consider delay as referring to days at a time. TRAP and INFORM objects SHOULD NOT be designed as a solution to a single environment if they could reasonably be designed to encompass multiple environments.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.3.p.2">Because of the introduction of delay into the management process, designers SHOULD consider what is valuable to a management station relative to when that station will receive a notification.  Since DTN elements can be managed both locally and remotely, designers of notifications SHOULD consider whether the notification can be used in a timely or delayed environment. To this same end, a designer SHOULD consider the ways (if any) a notifications can be made to serve both purposes.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.3.4.p.1">Extension blocks created for use with the Bundle Protocol are likely to contain characteristics not managed by the BP-MIB. However, the management of information regarding these characteristics SHOULD reference the Node by which the extension block was processed. There are two ways in which this MAY be done. First, a designer could reference the Node by its bpNodeID value. Second, since each Node is a member of at least one Singleton Endpoint, the Endpoint ID (EID) belonging to a Singleton of which the desired Node is a member can be used. This document however, RECOMMENDS use of bpNodeID. Use of a Singleton's EID could fail in cases where a Node is a member of multiple Singleton Endpoints. As long as one other Singleton exists for the Node, it can unregister a Singleton Endpoint. If the EID used to reference the Node belonged to the unregistered Singleton, a management stations would no longer be able to know which Node is related to the extension block information.</p>

    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module was designed for the management of Bundle 
        Protocol (BP) Nodes, for the Endpoints they are members of, 
        and for Node &lt;===&gt; CLA relationships. This MIB is structured 
        in a way that Node-Specific objects are arranged separately 
        from Endpoint and CLA -Specific objects. Objects which are 
        Endpoint or CLA -Specific are arranged in Conceptual Rows 
        within their own, respective, Conceptual Tables. Further, 
        each instance of this module's objects represents a single 
        managed Node. This means that a separate instantiation of 
        the BP-MIB's objects will be forged for each Node being 
        managed by the system. The layout of the MIB is arranged in 
        the following order:

        * Node-Specific Definitions
        * Endpoint-Specific Definitions
        * CLA-Specific Definitions
        * Conformance Requirements for the BP-MIB"

    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This Conceptual table contains the set of CLAs (Convergence 
        Layer Adapters) that this Node has access to. A CLA is an 
        interface between the BPA (Bundle Protocol Agent) and an 
        internetwork protocol suite. CLAs and their functions are 
        implementation specific, so this set of managed information 
        doesn't contain much in the way of detail.

        The items in this table are similar to the ifStackTable in 
        RFC 2863, albeit different in that it only tracks the layer
        below the BPA (because the Bundle Protocol rests at the
        application layer and anything above itself would be
        considered tunneling). Each row represents a single CLA; 
        what Convergence Layer it's using, and layer traversal 
        information.

        Adapter) of this Node. A CLA, as defined in RFC 5050, is an 
        interface between the Bundle Protocol Agent and an

        reference to the layer beneath the BPA or, worded 
        differently, to its CL (Convergence Layer). It's the job of 
        the bpClType object in each row to denote what type of 
        protocol the CL is. If the underlying layer is not an 
        inter-networking protocol, the bpClType is set to 1 (which 
        signifies that it's an interface).

        Each value herein uniquely represents a Convergence Layer 
        type and, likewise, can be used in conjunction with the 
        bpClID value to find managed information regarding an 
        instance of the appropriate CLA's MIB.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">Though SNMPv3 is the current de facto standard of network management protocols, there is no guarantee that this will hold true in the DTN architecture. With this in mind, any protocols used should consider, to the fullest feasible extent, the security measures used in SNMPv3. Those protocols should also consider those security considerations specifically listed in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.2">There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. So, if this MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct SNMP SET operations.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.3">SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.4">It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.5">Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.</p>
