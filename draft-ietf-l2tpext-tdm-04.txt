1. Introduction 
    
   This document defines extensions to the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol 
   Version 3(L2TPv3) for support of structure-agnostic [RFC4553] and 
   structure-aware [PWE3-CESoPSN] TDM pseudowires. Encapsulation of the 
   structure-agnostic TDM PWs over L2TPv3 is described in [RFC4553], 
   Figure 2b. Encapsulation of the structure-aware TDM PWs over L2TPv3 
   is described in [PWE3-CESoPSN], Figures 1c (TDM data packets) and 4a 
   (CE application signaling packets). However, the order of the CESoPSN 
   Control Word (CW) and RTP header (if it is used) MUST match between 
   the TDM data and CE signaling packets. 
    
   Setup of structure-aware pseudowires using encapsulations described 
   in [PWE3-TDMoIP] has been left for further study.  
    
   Setup and maintenance of TDM PWs in MPLS networks using LDP is 
   described in [PWE3-TDM-CTR]. 
    
    
2. L2TP Extension 
    
   The L2TP Control Connection is responsible for 3 main operations: 
   1. Establishment and validation of a pseudowire (PW) session. 
   2. Ending (tearing down) of a pseudowire session. 
   3. Transferring of End Point status.

   Tearing down of session for a TDM pseudowire is identical to 
   [RFC3931]. 
    
   [PWE3-CESoPSN] and [RFC4553] describe how to transfer the Attachment 
   Circuit (AC) status via the data plane. This is therefore NOT 
   RECOMMENDED to use the Set-Link-Info (SLI) message described in 
   [RFC3931] for conveying this status with the PWs in question. 
    
   [RFC3931] specifies that the Circuit Status AVP MUST be present in 
   the ICRQ/ICRP messages. It also specifies that the N bit in this AVP 
   should be set during the PW setup even if the specific AC does not 
   provide any way to convey the "new AC" indication. Accordingly, the 
   Circuit Status AVP for the PWs in question, when used in the 
   ICRQ/ICRP messages, MUST always have both N and A bits set.  
    
   The next sections describe the extensions to the L2TP for 
   establishment and validation of TDM pseudowire sessions. 
    
   There are 2 new AVPs for the Session Connection Messages. One AVP 
   describe the TDM pseudowire attributes. The second AVP describe the 
   RTP attributes for this TDM pseudowire.  
    
2.1 TDM PW AVP  (ICRQ, OCRQ) 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit MAY be 0 or 1).  The M bit for this 
   AVP SHOULD be set to 0.  The Length (before hiding) of this AVP is 
   12. 
    
   The Bit Rate field contains the value that represents the bit rate of 
   the local AC in the units of 64 Kbit/s encoded as an unsigned 16-bit 
   integer. Its usage for all types of TDM PWs implies the following 
   semantics: 
  1) Only the following values MUST be specified for structure-agnostic 
     emulation (see [RFC4553]): 
     a) Structure-agnostic E1 emulation  - 32 
     b) Structure-agnostic T1 emulation: 
         i) MUST be set to 24 for the basic mode  
         ii) MUST be set to 25 for the "Octet-aligned T1" mode 
     c) Structure-agnostic E3 emulation  - 535

     d) Structure-agnostic T3 emulation  - 699 
  2) For CESoPSN PWs this parameter MUST be set to the number of DS0 
     channels in the corresponding attachment circuit. 
    
   Note: For structure-agnostic T1 emulation the values 24 and 25 do not 
   reflect the exact bit rate, and are used for convenience only.  
    
   Note: The semantics of the Bit Rate field defined above are 
   consistent with those of the Bit Rate Interface Attribute as defined 
   in [PWE3-TDM-CTR]. 
    
   The Payload Bytes field contains the value that represents the number 
   of the TDM Payload bytes in the PW packet and is used with the 
   following semantics: 
    
  1) For structure-agnostic emulation any value of the payload bytes can 
     be specified. 
  2) For CESoPSN PWs: 
     a) The specified value MUST be an integer multiple of number of 
         DS0 channels in the corresponding attachment circuit. 
     b) In addition to that, for trunk-specific NxDS0 with CAS, 
         (Payload Bytes/number of DS0 channels) MUST be an integer 
         factor of the number of frames per corresponding trunk 
         multiframe. 
 
   The Reserved bits are reserved. They MUST be set to 0 on transmission 
   and MUST be ignored on reception. 
    
   The SP bits define support for the CESoPSN application signaling 
   packets (see [PWE3-CESoPSN]) and MUST be used as following: 
  1) Set to '00' for TDM PWs that do not use signaling packets 
  2) Set to '01' for the CESoPSN PWs carrying TDM data packets and 
     expecting CE application signaling packets in a separate PW 
  3) Set to '10' for a PW carrying CE application signaling packets with 
     the data packets in a separate PW 
  4) Set to '11' for e CESoPSN PW carrying both TDM data and signaling 
     packets. 
   
   The CAS bits define the trunk type for trunk-specific CESoPSN 
   services with CAS. These bits: 
  1) MUST be set to 0 for all pseudowire types excluding trunk-specific 
     CESoPSN with CAS 
  2) For trunk-specific CESoPSN with CAS these bits bust be set to: 
     a) '01' in the case of an E1 trunk 
     b) '10' in the case of a T1/ESF trunk 
     c) '11' in the case of a T1/SF trunk.

   Presence of this AVP indicates that the RTP header is used in the TDM 
   pseudowire encapsulation. Use or non-use of the RTP header MUST match 
   for the two directions of a TDM PW. This AVP MAY be hidden (the H bit 
   MAY be 0 or 1).  The M bit for this AVP SHOULD be set to 0.  The 
   Length (before hiding) of this AVP is 16. 
    
   The D bit indicates the timestamping mode (absolute or differential) 
   in the RTP header. These modes are described in, e.g., in [RFC4553], 
   Section 4.3.2. If the D bit is set to 1 then the Differential 
   timestamping mode is used, otherwise the Absolute timestamping mode 
   is used.  Timestamping modes can be used independently for the two 
   directions of a TDM PW. 
    
   The C bit indicates the ordering of the RTP header and the control 
   word as following: 
    
    o If the C bit is set to 1 the RTP header appears after the control 
     word in the data channel of the TDM pseudowire. This mode is 
     described as SAToP/CESoPSN encapsulation over IPv4/IPv6 PSN with 
     L2TPv3 demultiplexing in [RFC4553] and [PWE3-CESoPSN] respectively.  
    o If the C bit is set to 0 the RTP header appears before the control 
     word.  This mode described as the old mode of the SAToP/CESoPSN 
     encapsulation over L2TPv3 in [RFC4553], Appendix A, and [PWE3-
     CESoPSN], Annex C, respectively.   
    
   PT is the payload type expected in the RTP header.  Value of zero 
   indicates that the payload type is ignored and will not be used to 
   detect malformed packets. 
   Timestamp Clock Frequency is the clock frequency used for the time 
   stamping in 8 KHz. 
    
   SSRC indicates the expected value of SSRC ID in the RTP header.  A 
   zero in this field means that SSRC ID will not be used for detecting 
   misconnections. Since L2TP provides an alternative security mechanism

   via the cookies, if the cookie length is larger then zero the SSRC 
   SHOULD be zero. 
    
2.3 Changes in the Control Connection AVPs 
    
   Control Connection that support TDM MUST add the appropriate PW Type 
   value to the list in the Pseudowire Capabilities List AVP. The exact 
   value is TBA by IANA and is listed in the next section. 
    
2.4 Changes in the Session Connection AVPs 
    
   PW Type AVP should be set to one of the following values: 
   1. Structure-agnostic emulation [RFC4553] of: 
      a. E1 circuits - TBA-SAToP-E1 by IANA. The value 0x0011 is 
         suggested for alignment with [RFC4446] 
      b. T1 circuits - TBA-SAToP-T1 by IANA. The value 0x0012 is 
         suggested for alignment with [RFC4446] 
      c. E3 circuits - TBA-SAToP-E3 by IANA. The value 0x0013 is 
         suggested for alignment with [RFC4446] 
      d. T3 circuits - TBA-SAToP-T3 by IANA. The value 0x0014 is 
         suggested for alignment with [RFC4446] 
   2. Structure-aware emulation [PWE3-CESoPSN] of: 
      a. CESoPSN basic mode - TBA-CESoPSN-Basic by IANA. The value 
         0x0015 is suggested for alignment with [RFC4446]  
      b. Trunk-specific CESoPSN service with CAS - TBA-CESoPSN-CAS by 
         IANA. The value 0x0017 is suggested for alignment with 
         [RFC4446].  
    
   TDM pseudowires use their own control word.  Therefore the L2-
   Specific Sublayer AVP MUST either be omitted or set to zero. 
    
   TDM pseudowires use their own sequencing.  Therefore the Data 
   Sequencing AVP MUST either be omitted or set to zero. 
    
   Note: The Control Word (CW) used in the SAToP and CESoPSN 
   encapsulations over L2TPv3 effectively represents a dedicated L2-
   Specific Sub-layer.  
    
3. Creation of the TDM Pseudowire Session 
    
   When LCCE wants to open a Session for TDM PW it MUST include the TDM 
   PW AVP (in any case) and the RTP AVP (if and only if the RTP header 
   is used) in the ICRQ or OCRQ message.  The LCCE peer must validate 
   the TDM PW AVP and make sure it can meet the requirements derived 
   from the RTP AVP (if it exist).  If the peer agrees with the TDM AVP 
   it will send an appropriate ICRP or OCRP message with the matching 
   RTP AVP (if needed). The Initiator need to validate that it can 
   supply the requirements derived from the received RTP AVP.

   The two peers MUST agree on the values in the TDM PW AVP: 
    
   1. Bit Rate values MUST be equal on both sides. If they are 
      different, the connection will be rejected with return code RC-
      TBD-1 and error code EC-TBD-1.  
   2. In the case of trunk-specific CESoPSN with CAS, the trunk type (as 
      encoded in the CAS bits of the TDM AVP) MUST be the same for the 
      two sides. Otherwise the connection will be rejected with return 
      code RC-TBD-1 and error code EC-TBD-2. 
   3. If one side does not support the payload bytes value proposed by 
      the other one, the connection will be rejected with return code 
      RC-TBD-1 and error code EC-TBD-3. 
   4. If one side cannot send RTP header requested by the other side, 
      the connection will be rejected with return code RC-TBD-1 and 
      error code EC-TBD-4. 
   5. If one side can send RTP header but not with the requested 
      timestamp clock frequency, the connection will be rejected with 
      return code RC-TBD-1 and error code EC-TBD-5. 
 
  If CESoPSN basic NxDS0 PW is extended to support CE application 
  signaling in a separate PW instance, then the two PW instances: 
   
   1. MUST use the same PW type 
   2. MUST use the same values in all the fields of the TDM AVP 
      excluding the SP field which must be set to '01' for teh TDM data 
      PW and to '10' for the PW carrying CE application signaling 
   3. MUST both use or not use RTP header (and accordingly, include or 
      not include the RTP AVP). 
   
    
4. IANA Considerations 
 
   This draft requires assignment of the following values by IANA: 
    
   PW types listed in Section 2.1 above. It is RECOMMENDED to use the 
   same values as defined in [RFC4446]. 
       
   New attribute value pair IDs: 
    
   1. AVP-TBD-1 - TDM Pseudowire AVP 
   2. AVP-TBD-2 - RTP AVP 
    
   New return codes and error codes: 
    
   1. RC-TBD-1 - return code to indicate connection refused because of 
      TDM PW parameters. The exact error code is as follows.  
   2. EC-TBD-1 - indicate Bit Rate values disagree.

   3. EC-TBD-2 - indicate different trunk types in the case of trunk-
      specific CESoPSN with CAS 
   4. EC-TBD-3 - requested payload size too big or too small. 
   5. EC-TBD-4 - RTP header cannot be generated. 
   6. EC-TBD-5 - requested timestamp clock frequency cannot be generated 
    
    
5. Security Considerations 
    
   This document specifies only the L2TPv3-based control plane for setup 
   of TDM PWs. Within this scope, there are no additional security 
   considerations on top of those discussed in [RFC3931]. 
    
   Common data plane security considerations for the TDM PWs have been 
   discussed in some detail in both [RFC4553] and [PWE3-CESoPSN]. On top 
   of these, the L2TPv3-based data plane provides additional security 
   mechanisms based on usage of cookies.
