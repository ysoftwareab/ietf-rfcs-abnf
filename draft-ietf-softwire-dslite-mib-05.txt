1.  Introduction

   Dual-Stack Lite [RFC6333] is a solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6
   connectivity to customers crossing an IPv6 only infrastructure.  One
   of its key components is an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel, which is used to
   provide IPv4 connectivity across a service provider's IPv6 network.
   Another key component is a carrier-grade IPv4-IPv4 Network Address
   Translation (NAT) to share service provider IPv4 addresses among
   customers.

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for using with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  This MIB module may be used for configuration and
   monitoring devices in a Dual-Stack Lite scenario.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

   [RFC2119] when they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in
   ALL CAPS (such as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual
   English meanings, and are not to be interpreted as [RFC2119] key
   words.

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
   [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580].

4.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   The Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  Each logical interface (physical or virtual)has
   an ifEntry.  Tunnels are handled by creating a logical interface
   (ifEntry) for each tunnel.  Each DS-Lite tunnel also acts as a
   virtual interface, which has a corresponding entry in the IP Tunnel
   MIB and Interface MIB.  Those corresponding entries are indexed by
   ifIndex.

   The ifOperStatus in ifTable is used to represent whether the DS-Lite
   tunnel function has been originated.  The ifInUcastPkts defined in
   ifTable will represent the number of IPv4 packets that have been
   encapsulated into IPv6 packets sent to a B4.  The ifOutUcastPkts
   defined in ifTable contains the number of IPv6 packets that can be
   decapsulated to IPv4 in the virtual interface.  Also, the IF-MIB
   defines ifMtu for the MTU of this tunnel interface, so DS-Lite MIB
   does not need to define the MTU for the tunnel.

5.  Difference from the IP tunnel MIB and NAT MIB

   The key technologies for DS-Lite are IP in IP (IPv4-in-IPv6) tunnels
   and NAT (IPv4 to IPv4 translation).

   Notes: According to section 5.2 of [RFC6333], DS-Lite only defines
   IPv4 in IPv6 tunnels at this moment, but other types of encapsulation
   could be defined in the future.  So this DS-Lite MIB only supports IP
   in IP encapsulation, if another RFC defined other tunnel types in the
   future, this DS-Lite MIB will be updated then.

   The NAT MIB [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-mib] is designed to carry
   translation from any address family to any address family, therefore
   it supports IPv4 to IPv4 translation.

   The IP Tunnel MIB [RFC4087] is designed for managing tunnels of any
   type over IPv4 and IPv6 networks, therefore it supports IP in IP
   tunnels.

   However, the NAT MIB and IP Tunnel MIB together are not sufficient to
   support DS-Lite.  This document describes the specific MIB
   requirements for DS-Lite, as below.

      In a DS-Lite scenario, the tunnel type is IP in IP, more
      precisely, is IPv4 in IPv6.  Therefore, it is unnecessary to
      describe tunnel type in DS-Lite MIB.

      In a DS-Lite scenario, the translation type is IPv4 private
      address to IPv4 public address.  Therefore, it is unnecessary to
      describe the type of address in the corresponding
      tunnelIfLocalInetAddress and tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress objects
      which are defined in the IP Tunnel MIB for DS-Lite MIB.

      In a DS-Lite scenario, the AFTR is not only the tunnel end
      concentrator, but also a 4-4 translator.  Within the Address
      Family Transition Router (AFTR), tunnel information and
      translation information MUST be mapped each other.  But the tunnel
      entry defined in the IP Tunnel MIB and the NAT mapping entry
      defined in the NAT MIB are not able to reflect this mapping
      relationship.  Therefore, a combined MIB is necessary.

   The implementation of the IP Tunnel MIB is required for DS-Lite.  The
   tunnelIfEncapsMethod in the tunnelIfEntry should be set to
   dsLite("xx"), and a corresponding entry in the DS-Lite module will
   exist for every tunnelIfEntry with this tunnelIfEncapsMethod.  The
   tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress must be set to "::".

6.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The DS-Lite MIB provides a way to monitor and manage the devices
   (AFTRs) in DS-Lite scenario through SNMP.

   The DS-Lite MIB is configurable on a per-interface basis.  It depends
   on several parts of the IF-MIB [RFC2863], IP Tunnel MIB [RFC4087],
   and NAT MIB [I-D.ietf-behave-nat-mib].

6.1.  The Object Group

   This Group defines objects that are needed for DS-Lite MIB.

6.1.1.  The dsliteTunnel Subtree

   The dsliteTunnel subtree describes managed objects used for managing
   tunnels in the DS-Lite scenario.  Because some objects defined in the
   IP Tunnel MIB are "not access", a few new objects are defined in DS-
   Lite MIB.

6.1.2.  The dsliteNAT Subtree

   The dsliteNAT subtree describes managed objects used for
   configuration as well as monitoring of AFTR which is capable of a NAT
   function.  Because the NAT MIB supports the NAT management function
   in DS-Lite, we may reuse it in DS-Lite MIB.  The dsliteNAT subtree
   also provides the information of mapping relationship between the
   tunnel entry and NAT entry by extending the IPv6 address of B4 to the
   natMappingTableEntry in the NAT MIB.

6.1.3.  The dsliteInfo Subtree

   The dsliteInfo subtree provides statistical information for DS-Lite.

6.2.  The Notification Group

   This group defines some notification objects for DS-Lite.

6.2.1.  The dsliteTrap Subtree

   The dsliteTrap subtree provides trap information in DS-Lite scenario.

6.3.  The Conformance Group

   The dsliteConformance subtree provides conformance information of MIB
   objects.

7.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   This MIB module IMPORTs objects from [RFC2578], [RFC2580], [RFC2863],
   [RFC3411], [RFC4001] and [RFC4008].

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      Notification thresholds: An attacker setting an arbitrarily low
      treshold can cause many useless notifications to be generated.
      Setting an arbitrarily high threshold can effectively disable
      notifications, which could be used to hide another attack.

      dsliteAFTRAlarmConnectNumber

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly



Fu, et al.              Expires October 31, 2014               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-mib-05         April 2014


   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      dsliteTunnelStartAddPreLen

      dsliteNATBindMappingIntRealm

      dsliteNATBindMappingIntAddressType

      dsliteNATBindMappingIntAddress

      dsliteNATBindMappingIntPort

      dsliteNATBindMappingPool

      dsliteNATBindMappingMapBehavior

      dsliteNATBindMappingFilterBehavior

      dsliteNATBindMappingAddressPooling

      dsliteStatisticDiscard

      dsliteStatisticTransmitted

      dsliteStatisticIpv4Session

      dsliteStatisticIpv6Session

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator



Fu, et al.              Expires October 31, 2014               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-mib-05         April 2014


   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry, and
   the following IANA-assigned tunnelType values recorded in the
   IANAtunnelType-MIB registry:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------
         DSLite-MIB         { transmission XXX }

         IANAtunnelType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

                    SYNTAX     INTEGER {

                               dsLite ("XX")        -- dslite tunnel

                               }

   Notes: As Appendix A of the IP Tunnel MIB[RFC4087] described that it
   has already assigned the value direct(2) to indicate the tunnel type
   is IP in IP tunnel, but it is still difficult to distinguish DS-Lite
   tunnel packets from normal IP in IP tunnel packets in the scenario of
   the AFTR connecting to both a DS-lite tunnel and an IP in IP tunnel.
