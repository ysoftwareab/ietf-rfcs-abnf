Abstract 

   This draft is aimed at presenting ANCP Multicast Handling in order to 
   extend the high level multicast description currently present in [1] 
   and [2]. The document describes the ANCP Multicast use cases as well 
   as the protocol requirements and message flows derived from the use 
   cases. The proposal is mainly driven by the following two objectives. 
   First, enabling NAS and AN to functionally behave as one single black 
   box, while replication is performed on the AN, but without any loss 
   of functionality compared to if replication was performed on NAS. 
   Second, allowing the necessary information to be provided by NAS to 
   the AN to perform multicast admission decision locally when possible 
   and/or desirable, and allowing the AN to query the NAS when further 
   decisions are needed.

1. Introduction 

   [1] defines a framework and requirements for an Access Node Control 
   Mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node 
   (e.g. a Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (DSLAM)) in a 
   multi-service reference architecture in order to perform QoS-related, 
   service-related and Subscriber-related operations. [2] specifies a 
   Protocol for Access Node Control Mechanism in Broadband Networks in 
   line with this framework. 

   [1] and [2] already cover different use cases related to unicast 
   traffic, but they do not yet appropriately cover multicast use cases.  

   This document describes key ANCP Multicast use cases as well as the 
   protocol requirements and message flows derived from such use cases;

   This proposal aims at collecting feedback from this community in 
   order to work towards consensus. Eventually, text derived from the 
   material in section 3. and 4. would be intended to be incorporated in 
   "ANCP Framework I-D" [1]. Similarly, text derived from the material 
   of section 5. would be intended to be incorporated in "ANCP Protocol 
   I-D" [2] and to be extended with actual protocol extensions. 

   The proposal is guided by the following objectives: 

      * when replication is performed by the AN, enable the combination 
   of NAS and AN to functionally behave as one single black box, without 
   any loss of functionality compared to if replication was performed on 
   NAS. 

      * enable the necessary information to be provided by NAS to the 
   AN, so that the AN can perform locally the conditional access and 
   admission control decisions when possible and/or desirable, and allow 
   the AN to query the NAS for further decisions in other cases. 

2. Multicast Terminology 

   o  Multicast Flow: multicast Any Source Multicast (ASM) group or 
      multicast Source Specific Multicast (SSM) (S,G) channel.  An 
      application channel (such as a TV channel) is mapped onto a 
      Multicast Flow. 

   o  Multicast Flow-Group: A set of same bandwidth multicast flows 
      sharing the same conditional access policy. For the purpose of CAC 
      on the access line, channel changing between flows of the same 
      Flow-Group can happen without the need for bandwidth or policy 
      reconsideration. 

   o  Join: signaling from the user equipment that it wishes to start 
      receiving a new multicast flow. In ASM, it is referred to as a 
      "Join". In SSM [6], it is referred to as a "subscribe". In IGMPv2, 
      "joins" are indicated through an "IGMPv2 membership report". In 
      IGMPv3 [4], "join" are indicated through "IGMPv3 membership 
      report" using different Filter-Mode-Change (ASM) and Source-List-
      Change Records.

   o  Leave: signaling from the user equipment that it wishes to stop 
      receiving a multicast flow. With IGMPv2 this is conveyed inside 
      the "Leave Group" message while in IGMPv3, "leave" is indicated 
      through "IGMPv3 membership report" message using different Filter-
      Mode-Change (ASM) and Source-List-Change Records. 

   Note that with respect to the join and leave defined above, this 
   document does not concern itself with all the possible combinations 
   allowed in [4] for EXCLUDE/INCLUDE in "IGMPv3 membership report" 
   messages. It only concerns itself with the use of EXCLUDE/INCLUDE to 
   achieve the equivalent of an ASM join/leave and the equivalent of an 
   SSM join/leave (see [5]). 

    

3. Multicast Use Cases  

3.1. Multicast Conditional Access 

   In a DSL Broadband access scenario Service Providers may want to 
   dynamically control, at the network level, access to some Multicast 
   Flows on a per user basis. This may be used in order to differentiate 
   among multiple Service Offers or to realize/reinforced conditional 
   access for sensitive content (in addition to content protection 
   mechanisms which may also exist at the application level). 

   In some cases, it is possible to provision the necessary conditional 
   access information into the AN so the AN can then perform the 
   conditional access decisions autonomously. For these cases, the NAS 
   will use ANCP to provision the necessary information in the AN so 
   that the AN can then perform conditional access enforcement locally 
   (i.e. decide locally to honor a join or do not honor a join). 

   In some cases, it is desirable to have the conditional access 
   decision taken by the NAS. For example, this may be because the 
   conditional access control needs to be tied to a more complex 
   policy/authorization mechanism, e.g. time of day access, or location 
   based access or to invoke a remote authorisation server. For these 
   cases, the AN will use ANCP to query the NAS, that in turn will 
   respond to the AN indicating whether the join is to be honored (and 
   hence replication performed by the AN) or denied.

Internet-Draft         ANCP Multicast Handling                June 2007 
    

   Querying the NAS before performing a join on the AN may increase 
   channel join and channel change times. However, pre-provisioning per 
   subscriber profiles potentially different for each subscriber may 
   cause high memory requirements on the AN or large delays when 
   restarting NAS or AN, or when having to change conditional access 
   policies. The notion of Flow-Groups (introduced in section 2.) is a 
   means to compromise between these operational factors. 

   Thus, in some cases, it is desirable to have the decision for 
   multicast Flow change within aFlow-Group handled by the AN, and have 
   the NAS only take a conditional access decision upfront for the whole 
   Multicast Flow-Group. For these cases, the AN will use ANCP to query 
   the NAS on receipt of the join for the first Multicast Flow from a 
   given Multicast Flow-Group. Then, when responding to the AN, the NAS 
   will indicate that the decision applies to the whole Multicast Flow-
   Group. The AN can then autonomously honor changes for a given 
   user/port from one Multicast flow from that Multicast Flow-group to 
   another Multicast Flow of the same Multicast Flow-Group. 

 

3.2. Multicast Admission Control  

   The successful delivery of Triple Play Broadband services is quickly 
   becoming a big challenge for most of the Service Providers nowadays. 
   Solely increasing available bandwidth is not always practical, cost-
   economical and/or sufficient to satisfy end user experience given not 
   only the strict requirements of unicast delay sensitive applications 
   like VoIP and Video on Demand, but also the fast growth of multicast 
   interactive applications such as videoconferencing, digital TV, 
   digital audio, online movies and networked gaming. These applications 
   are typically characterized by a delay sensitive nature, an extremely 
   loss sensitive nature and intensive bandwidth requirements. They are 
   also typically "non-elastic", which means that they operate at a 
   fixed bandwidth, that cannot be dynamically adjusted to the currently 
   available bandwidth.  

    Therefore an admission control mechanism covering admission of 
   multicast traffic over the DSL Broadband access is required, in order 
   to avoid oversubscribing the available bandwidth and negatively 
   impacting the end user experience.

Internet-Draft         ANCP Multicast Handling                June 2007 
    

   Considering specifically admission control over the access line, 
   before honoring a user request to join a new multicast flow, the 
   combination of AN and NAS MUST ensure admission control is performed 
   to validate that there is enough "video" bandwidth remaining on the 
   access line to carry the new flow (in addition to all other multicast 
   and unicast video traffic). The solution needs to cope with multiple 
   Flows per access line and needs to allow access line bandwidth to be 
   dynamically shared across multicast and unicast traffic (both when 
   unicast CAC is performed by NAS or by some off-path Policy Server). 

   In some cases, it is desirable to have the multicast admission 
   control decision taken by the NAS. For example, this may be because 
   the multicast admission control decision needs to be synchronized 
   with unicast admission control that may be performed by the NAS, or 
   that may be performed by a remote entity (e.g. by a remote policy 
   server) that requires synchronization information about multicast 
   bandwidth usage. For these cases, the AN will use ANCP to query the 
   NAS, that in turn will respond to the AN indicating whether the join 
   is to be honored (and hence replication performed by the AN) or 
   denied. 

   In some cases, it is desirable to have the decision for multicast 
   admission control handled by the AN. With the notion of Flow-Groups 
   (defined in section 2.), the AN locally performs all the decisions 
   for multicast flow change within a Flow-Group while the  NAS only 
   takes an admission control decision upfront for the whole Multicast 
   Flow-Group. For these cases, the AN will use ANCP to query the NAS on 
   receipt of the join for the first Multicast Flow from a given 
   Multicast Flow-Group. Then, when responding to the AN, the NAS will 
   indicate that the admission control decision applies to the whole 
   Multicast Flow-Group. The AN can then autonomously honor changes for 
   a given user/port from one Multicast Flow from that Multicast Flow-
   Group to another Multicast Flow of the same Multicast Flow-Group.  

3.3. Multicast Accounting 

   Whenever accurate per-subscriber or per access-line, time or volume 
   based accounting records are required, the AN performing multicast 
   replication needs to provide the NAS with accurate information in 
   order to generate accounting information on a per-user/per-Multicast 
   Flow basis (e.g. when a particular user starts/stops receiving a 
   Multicast Flow, received volume, replication start and stop 
   timestamp...).

3.4. Multicast Termination 

   The capability to dynamically stop the replication of a multicast 
   flow can be useful in different scenarios: for example in case of 
   prepaid service when available credit expires Service Provider may 
   want to be able to stop multicast replication on a specified AN port 
   for a particular user. Another example of applicability for this 
   functionality is a scenario where a Service Provider would like to 
   show a "Content Preview": in this case a multicast content will be 
   delivered just for a fixed amount of time. In both cases an external 
   entity (for example a policy server or an external application 
   entity), instructs the NAS to interrupt the Multicast replication of 
   a specified multicast flow to a specified user.  

   When Multicast replication occurs on AN, NAS MUST be able to revoke 
   the authorization previously granted to the AN to replicate the 
   multicast flow, for a specific user/group on a specified port. When 
   Access Node stops replicating a multicast flow for the specified 
   user/port it should also be able to block successive IGMP requests 
   for the same group from the same user. 

4. Protocol Requirements 

   This section contains the protocol requirements for the ACNP control 
   mechanism that can be derived from the previously described use 
   cases. 

4.1. Conditional Access Use case with local AN decision  

   We define the following notions:  

   o  White list: List that identifies the Multicast Flows for which the 
      AN, on receiving a join message, is to autonomously start 
      replicating multicast traffic without requesting further 
      authorization to the NAS;  

   o  Black list: List that identifies the Multicast Flows for which the 
      AN, on receiving a join message, autonomously knows that is not 
      authorized to start replicating multicast traffic. 

   The White List and Black List can contain entries allowing: 

   o  an exact match for a (*,G) ASM group (e.g. <G=g.h.i.l>) 
 
 
Maglione              Expires December 29, 2007                [Page 8] 
    
Internet-Draft         ANCP Multicast Handling                June 2007 
    

   o  an exact match for a (S,G) SSM channel (e.g. <S=s.t.u.v,G=g.h.i.l> 

   o  a mask-based range match for a (*,G) ASM group (e.g. 
      <G=g.h.i.l/Mask>) 

   o  a mask-based range match for a (S,G) SSM channel (e.g. 
      <S=s.t.u.v/Mask,G=g.h.i.l/Mask> 

    

   The following requirements allow support of the Conditional Access 
   Use case with local AN decision: 

   1. ANCP MUST allow AN to be provisioned with Black and White Lists;  

   2. ANCP MUST allow to bind a particular Black and White Lists to a 
      given AN port; 

   3. An AN MUST unconditionally deny join to a Multicast Flow matching 
      the Black-List for relevant AN Port; 

   4. An AN MUST unconditionally accept join to a Multicast Flow 
      matching the White-List for relevant AN Port; 

   5. When a Multicast Flow matches both in the Black List and the White 
      List, the AN MUST use the most specific match. 

   6. Upon receiving a join to a Multicast Flow which does not match  
      any entry in the Black List nor in the White List for a specific 
      port, MUST query the NAS, that in turn MUST respond to the AN 
      indicating whether that join is to be honored or denied. 

 

4.2. Conditional Access and Admission Control with NAS decision 

   The requirements below allow support of Conditional Access with NAS 
   decisions as well as query by NAS of a remote AAA authorization 
   server. This also supports Admission Control with NAS decision (in 
   turn allowing integrated unicast CAC to be performed either on NAS or 
   on remote off-path server) while replication is still done on AN:

Internet-Draft         ANCP Multicast Handling                June 2007 
    

   7. ANCP MUST support Admission Request messages (from AN to NAS) and 
      Admission Response messages (from NAS to AN). Admission Request 
      messages allow AN to query NAS for additional decision/information 
      (e.g. query NAS for additional validation before honoring a join) 

   8. AN MUST issue Admission Request when further decision by NAS is 
      needed; 

   9. NAS MUST issue Admission Response conveying decision to AN. 

4.3. Multicast Accounting 

   The following requirements allow support of the Multicast Accounting 
   use case with replication done on AN: 

   10. ANCP Admission Response MUST allow optional indication by NAS 
      that "accounting is needed" for this port/multicast flow; 

   11. When Admission Response includes "accounting needed", AN 
      supporting accounting MUST issue an Information Report whenever 
      replication starts/stops for the port/Multicast Flow. 

4.4. Conditional Access and Admission Control with local-AN decisions 
   within a given Flow-Group 

   The following requirements allow support of Conditional Access and 
   Admission Control with local-AN decisions for all Multicast Flow 
   changes within a given Flow-Group: 

   12. ANCP MUST allow the AN to indicate whether the notion of Flow-
      Group is supported by the AN or not; 

   13. ANCP MUST allow AN to be provisioned with Multicast Flow-Groups; 

   14. When receiving a join request for the first multicast flow of a 
      given Flow-Group, the AN MUST issue an Admission Request to NAS; 

   15. ANCP Admission Response, MUST optionally allow NAS to indicate 
      that a decision is valid for the whole Flow-Group instead of just 
      for that single Flow;

Internet-Draft         ANCP Multicast Handling                June 2007 
    

   16. When Admission Response indicates that a NAS decision is valid 
      for a Flow-group, an AN supporting Multicast Flow-Groups MUST 
      locally honor all Multicast Flow changes within that Flow-Group 
      (i.e. without any further Admission Request to NAS); 

   17. When there is no longer any active Multicast Flow of a given 
      Flow-Group, an AN supporting Multicast Flow-Groups MUST issue a 
      Admission Request indicating that the line bandwidth is no longer 
      used by the Flow-Group. 

4.5. Multicast Termination 

   This requirement allows support of the Multicast Termination use case 
   with replication done on AN: 

   18. ANCP MUST allow NAS to revoke a decision that had been conveyed 
      earlier to AN in an Admission Response; 

   19. When receiving such a revocation, the AN MUST stop replication of 
      the corresponding Multicast-Flow to the corresponding user/port.  

5. Message Flow 

   This section presents the Message Flows supporting the uses cases 
   previously described. Three different categories of Message Flow have 
   been identified:  

   o  Provision AN with initial configurations (including both 
      White/Black Lists and Multicast-Flow Groups;) and Conditional 
      Access with AN Decision 

   o  Multicast Flow Admission control; 

   o  Multicast Flow-Group Admission Control. 

   Message Flow related to Admission Control are presented combining, in 
   incremental way, the three basic functions involved in the use cases: 

   o  Admission Control; 

   o  Accounting Capability; 

   o  Policy Server Synchronization.

5.1. Provision AN with initial configurations 

  5.1.1. Provisioning AN with White/Black-List and Conditional Access 
     with AN Decision 

   The following Message Flow describes the AN provisioning with White 
   and Black lists. Initial configuration for White/Black lists is 
   called Standard Multicast Profile and is identified by a "Multicast 
   Profile ID".   

   The AN provisioning is performed by NAS using a Push Profile message 
   that contains both the "Multicast Profile ID" and the White/Black 
   Lists parameters. Each subscriber has its own Multicast Profile ID 
   associated to the user profile inside the Radius Server. As soon as 
   DSL line comes up, AN sends a PORT UP message to the NAS specifying 
   the Port ID, the NAS replies with a PORT_MNGT message that, together 
   with the other parameters, includes the Multicast Profile ID for that 
   specific subscriber.  

   The Messages involved in the following flow are: 

   o  Push_profile (Multicast Profile ID, White/Black Lists) 

   o  PORT_MNGT(Port_ID, Multicast Profile ID)

5.2. Multicast Flow Admission Control 

  5.2.1. Multicast Flow with NAS decision, without accounting, without 
     Policy Server Synchronization 

   The following Message Flow describes a scenario where Multicast 
   Admission control is required, while Accounting information and 
   Policy Server Synchronization are not needed. Admission control is 
   performed on per single multicast flow. 

   When AN receives a user request to join a new multicast flow which 
   has not been explicitly configured in Black or White List for that 
   port, AN sends an Admission Request message, correlated with Flow id 
   and Port ID parameters, to the NAS to verify if there is enough 
   "video" bandwidth remaining on the access line to carry the new flow. 
   The NAS answers with Admission Response also containing an Accounting 
   Flag (Acct_F) that specifies if Accounting is needed. In this 
   scenario Accounting Flag is set to zero, meaning no need for 
   Accounting Information. 

   When AN receives a user Leave Message, for the previously joined 
   multicast flow, AN sends an Admission Release message, correlated 
   with Flow id and Port ID parameters, to the NAS to release the 
   previously allocated bandwidth resources. 

   The Messages involved in the following flow are: 

   o  Admission Request (Flow id, Port Id) 

   o  Admission Response (Acct_F)

  5.2.2. Multicast Flow with NAS Decision, with accounting, Without 
     Policy Server Synchronization 

   The following Message Flow adds to the functionalities described by 
   flow in 5.2.1. the accounting capability. The Accounting_Required 
   Flag sent by NAS in the Admission Response message is set to 1 
   (meaning Accounting needed) and two new messages are used by AN to 
   signal Replication Start and Replication Stop.  

   When NAS receives the Replication Start message from the AN, it sends 
   an Accounting Start Message to the Radius Server, while when NAS 
   receives the Replication Stop message from the AN, it sends an 
   Accounting Stop Message to the Radius Server. 

   The Messages involved in this flow, in addition to those listed in 
   5.2.1. are: 

   o  Replication Start (Flow id, Port Id) 

   o  Replication Stop (Flow id, Port Id)

  5.2.3. Multicast Flow with NAS decision, without accounting, with 
     Policy Server Synchronization 

   The following Message Flow adds to the functionalities described by 
   flow in 5.2.1. the Policy Server Synchronization. The only difference 
   between this scenario and the one described in 5.2.1. is the 
   interaction between NAS and Policy Server. When NAS receives an 
   Admission Request message from the AN, instead of deciding 
   autonomously, it sends a QoS Request message to the Policy Server to 
   verify bandwidth availability. The Policy Server replies with a Qos 
   Reply message specifying if the NAS should honor the request.  When 
   AN receives a user Leave Message, for the previously joined multicast 
   flow, AN sends an Admission Release message, correlated with Flow id 
   and Port ID parameters, to the NAS to release the previously 
   allocated bandwidth resources. NAS on receiving Admission Release 
   Message from AN sends a Qos Release Message to the Policy Server. 

   The Messages involved in this flow, in addition to those listed in 
   5.2.1. are: 

   o  Qos Request 

   o  Qos Reply

  5.2.4. Multicast Flow with NAS decision, without accounting, without 
     Policy Server Synchronization, with AAA Server Multicast 
     Authorization 

   This scenario differs from the one described in 5.2.1. for the 
   interaction between NAS and Radius Server. In particular when NAS 
   receives an Admission Request message from the AN, instead of 
   deciding autonomously, it sends an Authorization Message to the 
   Radius Server to verify it that user is currently authorized to 
   received that specific Multicast Flow. 

   As far as ANCP, Messages involved in this flow are the same as the 
   ones listed in 5.2.1. , authorization check performed by NAS with 
   Radius Server, is based on Standard AAA messages.

  5.2.5. Multicast Flow Replication Stop with accounting,        without 
     Policy Server Synchronization 

   The following Message Flow describes the possibility to 
   asynchronously stop the Multicast Flow Replication.  

   When AN receives a user request to join a new multicast flow which 
   has not been explicitly configured in Black or White List for that 
   port, AN sends an Admission Request message, correlated with Flow id 
   and Port ID parameters, to the NAS to verify if there is enough 
   "video" bandwidth remaining on the access line to carry the new flow. 
   The NAS answers with Admission Response also containing an Accounting 
   Flag (Acct_F) that specifies that Accounting is needed (Accounting 
   Flag is set to one.) When AN receives the Admission Response message 
   it starts replicating the Multicast Flow and it sends a Replication 
   Start Message to the NAS. When NAS receives a notification from 
   Radius server telling that Prepaid Quota for that User/Flow expired, 
   NAS sends an Admission Teardown message to the AN to stop the 
   multicast Replication. NAS may include a timer for AN to block 
   further join to that Flow/Port-ID. 

   The Messages involved in this flow, in addition to those listed in 
   5.2.1. are:

   The following Message Flow is an optimization of scenario described 
   in 5.2.1. and it allows support of Conditional Access and Admission 
   Control for all Multicast Flow changes within a given Flow-Group. On

   receiving a Join Request for a new Multicast Flow which has not been 
   explicitly configured in Black or White List for that port, AN sends 
   and Admission Request message to the NAS only if that flow is the 
   first multicast flow of a given Flow Group. The Admission Request 
   also contains a Flow-Group Id. NAS replies with an Admission Response 
   indicating that the decision is valid for the whole Flow-Group 
   instead of just for a single Flow. Successive Join messages for Flows 
   belonging to the same Flow Group do not require Admission Control 
   check from AN to NAS, thus AN can autonomously decide to start 
   replicating the requested multicast Flow.  

   After receiving a Leave message AN waits for a predefined time-out 
   before sending the Admission Release Message to the NAS, in order to 
   see if the end user sends a Join Message for another Flow belonging 
   to the same Multicast Flow Group. 

   The Messages involved in the following flow are: 

   o  Admission Request (Flow id, Flow Group Id, Port Id) 

   o  Admission Response (Flow Group Id) 

   o  Admission Release (Flow Group Id, Port Id)

  5.3.2. Multicast Flow-Group with NAS decision,        with accounting, 
     with Policy Server Synchronization 

   This scenario adds to the one described in 5.3.1. the accounting 
   capability and the Policy Server interaction. The logic in same as 
   the one described for Multicast Flow scenario with NAS decision, 
   accounting and Policy Server Synchronization, but the Admission 
   Response is valid for all Flows belonging to the authorized Multicast 
   Flow-Group.

     Figure 9 Multicast Flow-Group with NAS decision, with accounting, 
                    with Policy Server Synchronization 

6. Security Considerations 

   Security of the ANCP protocol is discussed in [7].  

   With Multicast handling as described in this document, ANCP protocol 
   activity between the AN and the NAS is triggered by join/leave 
   requests coming from the end-user equipment. This could potentially 
   be used for denial of service attack against the AN and/or the NAS. 

   This is not a new class of risk over already possible IGMP messages 
   send from subscribers to the NAS when the AN uses no IGMP snooping 
   transparent as long as processing of ANCP messages on the NAS/AN is 
   comparable efficient and protected against congestion. 

   To mitigate this risk, the AN MAY implement control plane protection 
   mechanisms such as limiting the number of multicast flows a given 
   user can simultaneously join, or limiting the maximum rate of 
   join/leave from a given user. 

   We also observe that an operator can easily deploy some protection 
   against attacks using invalid multicast flows by taking advantage of 
   the mask-based match in the Black List. This way, join for invalid 
   multicast flows can be denied at the AN level without any ANCP 
   protocol interactions and without NAS involvement. 

    

7. IANA Considerations 

   The ANCP protocol extensions necessary to address the ANCP 
   requirements identified in this document are likely to result in 
   requests to IANA. Those will be identified in [2] if, and when, the 
   corresponding protocol extensions are incorporated in [2].
