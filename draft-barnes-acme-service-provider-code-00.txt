1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-acme-acme] is a mechanism for automating certificate
   management on the Internet.  It enables administrative entities to
   prove effective control over resources like domain names, and
   automates the process of generating and issuing certificates.  [I-
   D.barnes-acme-token-challenge] defines a new Identifier type (Entity
   Code) and new challenge type based on a token (Entity Code Token) for
   authorizing entities to request certificates.  The model includes an
   administrative authority that allocates the entity codes and creates
   the service provider code tokens for the entities.

   This specification defines the use of the Entity Code Identifier and
   Entity Code Token to enable certification authorities to issue
   certificates based on service provider codes and related tokens.

2.  Overview

   The document [ATIS-1000080] provides a framework and model for using
   certificates based on service provider codes.  In this model, each
   service provider requires only a few certificates, which are used in
   conjunction with a PASSporT that contains additional information
   attesting to a service provider's knowledge of the originator of the
   call.  Further details on the PASSporT extensions for this model are
   provided in the SHAKEN Framework [ATIS-1000074].

   In the SHAKEN Certificate Management framework [ATIS-1000080], there
   is an administrative entity that is responsible for allocating
   service provider codes.  This is referred to as the STI Policy
   Administrator (STI-PA).  This allows a certification authority to
   validate that the entity requesting issuance of a certificate is
   authorized to request certificates on behalf of the entity that has
   been assigned a specific service provider code.  A single VoIP
   service provider can be allocated multiple service provider codes.  A
   service provider can choose to use the same certificate for multiple
   service providers as reflected by the structure of the TN
   Authorization List certificate extension defined in
   [I-D.ietf-stir-certificates].

Internet-Draft Service Provider Identifiers and Challenges  October 2017


   The intent of the challenges in this document is not to establish
   that an entity is a valid service provider but rather to provide
   evidence that an established administrative authority entity has
   authorized the entity to provide VoIP services in the network and
   thus to request credentials on behalf of the VoIP users in the
   network.

3.  Using Service Provider Codes for Token Authorization

   In order to issue certificates for service providers based on service
   provider code values, the Entity Code ACME identifier type is used in
   the ACME authorization objects.  The value is set to the value of the
   service provider code.  The ACME challenge type of "ec-token-01" is
   used to support the authorization of service provider code tokens.

   The following is the response that the ACME client receives when it
   sends a GET for the challenges in the case of a "EntityCode"
   identifer:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   Link: <https://example.com/acme/some-directory>;rel="directory"

   {
     "status": "pending",

     "identifier": {
        "type": "EntityCode",
        "value": ["1234-0111"]
      },

      "challenges": [
      {
        "type": "ec-token-01",
        "url": "https://sti-ca.com/authz/asdf/0"
        "token": "DGyRejmCefe7v4NfDGDKfA" }
      ],
   }

   A client responds to this challenge by using the service provider
   code token for the "ec-token" value.  In the SHAKEN Certificate
   Management framework, the Service Provider has a secure exchange with
   the STI-PA to obtain a service provider code token that can be used
   for authorization by the CA when requesting a certificate.  The
   service provider code token is a standard JWT token [RFC7519] using a
   JWS defined signature string [RFC7515].  It is RECOMMENDED that the
   lifetime of the service provider code token be greater than the
   certificate lifetime, in particular in cases where multiple

   certificates are being issued using the same service provider code
   token.

   The entity code token JWT Protected Header to support service
   provider code tokens MUST include the following:



      alg:  Defines the algorithm used in the signature of the token.
         For Service Provider Code tokens, the algorithm MUST be
         "ES256".

      typ:  Set to standard "JWT" value.

      x5u:  Defines the URL of the certificate of the STI-PA validating
         the Service Provider Code.

   The service provide code token JWT Payload MUST include the
   following:



      sub:  Service Provider Code value being validated in the form of
         an ASCII string.

      iat:  DateTime value of the time and date the token was issued.

      nbf:  DateTime value of the starting time and date that the token
         is valid.

      exp:  DateTime value of the ending time and date that the token
         expires.

      fingerprint:  : Fingerprint of the ACME credentials the Service
         Provider used to create an account with the CA.  The
         fingerprint is of the form:
         base64url(JWK_Thumbprint(accountKey)).

         The "JWK_Thumbprint" step indicates the computation specified
         in [RFC7638], using the SHA-256 digest [FIPS180-4].  As noted
         in JWA [RFC7518] any prepended zero octets in the JWK object
         MUST be stripped before doing the computation.

   To respond to a service provider code token challenge, the ACME
   client constructs an entity code authorization ("ec-authz") using the
   "token" value provided in the challenge and the service provider code
   token, that has been previously obtained from the STI-PA, as the
   "ecAuthzToken" value.

   An example of the use of the "ec-token-01" in a challenge response
   sent by the ACME client is provided below:


           POST /acme/authz/asdf/0 HTTP/1.1
           Host: sti-ca.com
           Content-Type: application/jose+json

           {
            "protected": base64url({
            "alg": "ES256",
            "kid": "https://sti-ca.com/acme/reg/asdf",
            "nonce": "Q_s3MWoqT05TrdkM2MTDcw",
            "url": "https://sti-ca.com/acme/authz/asdf/0"
           }),
            "payload": base64url({
            "ecAuthorization": "DGyRejmCefe7v4N...vb29HhjjLPSggwiE"
           }),
            "signature": "9cbg5JO1Gf5YLjjz...SpkUfcdPai9uVYYQ"
           }



   Upon receiving a response to the challenge, the ACME server
   determines the validity of the response as described in [I-D.barnes-
   acme-token-challenge].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA registrations.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document relies on the security considerations established for
   the ACME protocol per [I-D.ietf-acme-acme].  The service provider
   code token is initially obtained through a secure exchange between
   the service provider and the entity in the network that is
   responsible for determining what entities can operate as VoIP service
   providers (the STI Policy Administrator).  Further details on this
   are provided in [ATIS-1000080].
