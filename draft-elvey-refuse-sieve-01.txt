Abstract
   
   With "refuse", Sieve gains the ability to simply not accept an
   email during the SMTP transaction (instead of accepting it and then
   sending an MDN [MDN] back to the alleged sender using "reject").
   A Joe-job is a spam run forged to appear as though it came from an
   innocent party, who is then generally flooded by the bounces, MDNs
   and messages with complaints.  With "reject", MDNs contribute to
   the flood of Joe-job spam to victims of Joe-jobs; SMTP level
   refusals usually don't.  So "refuse" provides users the latter
   method to handle unwanted email.

1.   Discussion
   
   The SIEVE mail filtering language [SIEVE] "refuse" extension, if
   supported, permits users to handle unwanted email in a way that is
   sometimes preferable to the existing 'discard' and 'reject'
   capabilities.  When a spam-detection system suspects a message is
   spam, but isn't certain, discarding the email is considered too
   risky for some users, for example, those who receive sales leads by
   email. They are willing to use the reject command. Users are
   willing to reject but not discard because the sender of an email
   incorrectly marked as spam will receive a notification that the
   email was refused, and will likely try again to contact the
   intended recipient, perhaps via another method of communication.
   Unfortunately, this usage is problematic, because in the usual
   case, the email is indeed spam, and the alleged sender to whom the
   MDN caused by the reject will be sent will often be an innocent Joe-
   job victim.  "Refuse" is intended to be superior to "reject"
   because it will be less likely to result in email to an innocent
   victim.  "Refuse" refuses to accept an email for delivery instead
   of accepting it and then sending an MDN.  Much spam is sent through
   open proxies, so "refuse" reduces Joe-job bounces resulting from
   usage of reject. "Refuse" will also reduce Joe-jobs caused by virus
   self-propagation via emails with false sender information.
   "Refuse" may conserve bandwidth, by reducing the number of MDNs
   sent.
   

   
   
2.   Conventions Used in this Document
   
   Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section 1.1, including
   use of [KEYWORDS].
   
   This document does not attempt to define what exactly constitutes a
   spam or virus containing email or how it should be identified, or
   what actions should be taken when detected.

3.   Introduction and Overview
   
   "refuse" MUST refuse to accept an email for delivery at the
   SMTP/LMTP level by returning a 5XX reply code, instead of sending
   an MDN as required by "reject" action, other than for the specified
   exception.  A SIEVE implementation that cannot do so MUST NOT claim
   to support the refuse extension.
   
   There is an exception when an SMTP server has accepted multiple
   recipients for a single message, and at least one but not all of
   them are refusing delivery (whether the refusal is caused by
   execution of a Sieve "refuse" or for another reason). In this case,
   the server MUST accept the message and generate DSNs for all
   recipients that are refusing it.
   

4.   SIEVE Extension

   
   This section defines the "refuse" action.
   
4.1  Action refuse
   
      Syntax: refuse <reason: string>
   
   The "refuse" action refuses delivery of a message by sending back
   the 550 SMTP response code to an SMTP client.

   This extension can be only supported by a Sieve implementation
   running in a MTA.
   
   If the "reason" string is multiline, than the reason text MUST be
   returned as multiline SMTP/LMTP response, per [SMTP], section
   4.2.1.
   
   In the following script (which assumes support for the spamtest
   extension), messages that test highly positive for spam are
   refused.
   
      Example:
      require ["refuse", "spamtest"]

      if spamtest :value "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" "6" {
                   refuse text:
   SpamAssassin thinks the message is spam.
   It is therefore being refused.
   Please call 1-900-PAY-US if you want to reach us.
   .
                            ;
      elsif spamtest :value "ge" :comparator "i;ascii-numeric" "4" {
                   fileinto "Suspect";
                  }
   
  The following excerpt from an SMTP session shows it in action.
  .
  C: DATA
  S: 354 Send message, ending in CRLF.CRLF.
   ...
  C: .
  S: 550-SpamAssassin thinks the message is spam.
  S: 550-It is therefore being refused.
  S: 550 Please call 1-900-PAY-US if you want to reach us.
   
   SIEVE implementations that implement the "refuse" action must use
   the "refuse" capability string.
   
4.2  "refuse" compatibility with other actions
   
   "Refuse" cancels the implicit keep, and is incompatible with
   "reject" and other standard Sieve actions except "fileinto",
   explicit "keep",  and "redirect". "Refuse" is also incompatible
   with "vacation" extension [VACATION]. (It should be compatible and
   incompatible with the same actions as "reject", but [SIEVE] states
   "Implementations SHOULD prohibit reject when used with other
   actions." However we feel that "refuse" should be permitted when
   used with other actions such as "fileinto" and "redirect".  This
   could be useful for analyzing, tracking or reporting spam.  Also,
   users can use tricks (such as multiple redirects back to their own
   email addresses) to get around such a prohibition.)
   
   
4.3  Explicit accomodation for servers that support Enhanced Error
    Codes [ENHANCED-CODES]
   
   This section only concerns implementations that support Enhanced
   Error Codes.

   If the server supports RFC 2034 [ENHANCED-CODES] it MUST select an
   appropriate Enhanced Error Code (e.g. 5.7.1 or a more generic
   5.7.0) and prepend it to the "reason" text. I.e. on such an
   implementation, the example in section 4.1 would show up in SMTP
   as:
   
     550-5.7.1 SpamAssassin thinks the message is spam.
     550-5.7.1 It is therefore being refused.
     550 5.7.1 Please call 1-900-PAY-US if you want to reach us.
   
   if the server selected "5.7.1" as appropriate.
   

5.   Security Considerations
   
   The "refuse" extension does not raise any security considerations
   that are not present in the base [SIEVE] protocol, and these issues
   are discussed in [SIEVE].
   
   
6.   IANA Considerations
   
   The following section provides the IANA registration for the Sieve
   extensions specified in this document:
   
   
6.1  refuse registration
   
   To: iana@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of new Sieve extension
   
   Capability name: refuse
   Capability keyword: refuse
