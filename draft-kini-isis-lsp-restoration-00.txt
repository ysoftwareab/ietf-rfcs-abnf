Abstract

   Traffic engineering using MPLS involves the setting up of label
   switched paths (LSP) possibly with explicit routing and with
   bandwidth guarantees (for label switched paths). The reliability of
   these LSPs can be increased by providing a backup LSP onto which
   traffic can be switched upon failure of an element in the path of the
   active LSP. Backup LSPs can be routed in a way that bandwidth can be
   shared between backup links of more than one active path while still
   guaranteeing recoverability for a set of failures. This sharing greatly
   increases the network efficiency thereby increasing the number of LSPs
   that can be carried while maintaining guarantees. Algorithms which can
   route such recoverable LSPs while using only aggregate network usage 
   information are being developed. To route the active LSP and the
   (possibly shared) backup LSP, the topology information of the network
   is needed and  this can be provided by a link state routing protocol
   like IS-IS. This document describes the encoding of the additional
   information within the link state protocol data unit (LSPdu) of IS-IS
   to enable routing of shared backup paths.

Internet Draft     draft-kini-isis-lsp-restoration-00.txt      November 2000  
                                                                              
1. Introduction                                                               
                                                                              
   The concept of sharing links along backup paths is explained in [4].
   IS-IS (as described in [2] and [3]) is a link state protocol that
   can provide topology information about the network. Extensions to IS-IS
   to enable traffic engineering are described in [1]. This document
   proposes further TE extensions to IS-IS. These extensions provide
   aggregate information useful to calculate shared backup paths.

2. Extensions to the extended IS reachability TLV                             
                                                                              
   The IS-IS LSPdu is composed of a fixed header and a number of TLVs.
   The extensions described here add more information about a link to
   IS-IS LSPdu.

   The extensions described here add more information about a link to
   the extended IS reachability TLV (as described in section 5 of [1]).
   New sub-TLVs are defined for the link TLV (section 5 of [1]). All
   sub-TLVs defined in this document are optional.

   Sub-TLV Type  Length (octets) Name                                
   x1            4*8             link bandwidth allocated for active paths
                                  with backup  
   x2            4*8             link bandwidth allocated for active paths     
                                  without backup
   x3            4*8             link bandwidth allocated for backup paths

   Note : Only logical numbers (x1, .. x3) are used to describe the
   sub-TLV. Actual values can be assigned when this document is made
   a working group document.

2.1 Sub-TLV x1 : Link bandwidth allocated for active paths with backup

   This sub-TLV contains the bandwidth that is reserved on this link
   for active paths that have backup paths.

   The link bandwidths allocated for active paths is encoded in 32 bits
   in IEEE floating point format. The units are bytes (not bits!) per
   second.

2.2 Sub-TLV x2 : Link bandwidth allocated for active paths without backup

   This sub-TLV contains the bandwidth that is reserved on this link
   for active paths that do not have a backup.

   The link bandwidths allocated for active paths without a backup is
   encoded in 32 bits in IEEE floating point format. The units are bytes
   (not bits!) per second.

2.3 Sub-TLV x3 : Link bandwidth allocated for backup paths

   This sub-TLV contains the bandwidth that is allocated to backup paths.

                                                                              
S. Kini, et al                Expires April, 2001                   [Page 2] 
                                                                            
Internet Draft     draft-kini-isis-lsp-restoration-00.txt      November 2000  

   The link bandwidths allocated for backup paths is encoded in 32 bits
   in IEEE floating point format. The units are bytes (not bits!) per
   second.

3. Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues for IS-IS.

4. IANA Considerations

   The responsible Internet authority (presently called IANA) should assign
   values to x1, x2 and x3.
