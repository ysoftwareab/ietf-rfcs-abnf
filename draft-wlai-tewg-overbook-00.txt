1. Introduction 
    
   Requirements for DS-TE and the associated protocol extensions are 
   specified in references [1, 2], respectively.  A requirement is the 
   application of overbooking on LSPs for constraint-based routing and 
   admission control. 
    
   Use of overbooking is an integral part of current practice for 
   aggregate TE in live deployments.  However, overbooking methods have 
   not been described in any details in existing TE documents.  In DS-
   TE, with the use of bandwidth constraints for different Class-Types 
   (CT), overbooking must be specified explicitly and consistently in 
   the context of multiple CTs, for purposes of per-CT constraint-based 
   routing and per-CT admission control.  This document complements [1] 
   by presenting a precise formulation and a functional description of 
   overbooking methods in DS-TE from the *operational perspective* of 
   service providers. 
    
   As stated in [1], DS-TE is used "where fine-grained optimization of 
   transmission resources is sought."  In conjunction with bandwidth 
   constraints models [3, 4, 5, 6], overbooking is a TE mechanism 
   employed to support this requirement. 
    
   In this document, based on operational complexity, we compare and 
   analyze two approaches to overbooking: components-based and 
   integrated.  They are shown to be functionally equivalent.  It is 
   recommended that the integrated approach be used because of its 
   simplicity. 
    
    
2. Terminology 
    
   For a given Class-Type CTc (0 <= c <= MaxCT-1): 
    
   Requested(LSPc): service bandwidth requested before any adjustment 
   for overbooking, for an LSPc belonging to CTc 
    
   Tspec(LSPc): RSVP-TE Tspec bandwidth specified in TLV, for an LSPc 
   belonging to CTc

Internet-Draft   Overbooking in Diffserv-aware MPLS TE       Jun 2003 
 
 
   Reserved(LSPc): bandwidth reserved for an LSPc belonging to CTc 
    
   For aggregate TE as in current operation, there are no Class-Types.  
   In this case, the above terms become Requested(LSP), Tspec(LSP), and 
   Reserved(LSP), respectively. 
    
    
   Reserved(CTc): the sum of the bandwidth reserved by all established 
   LSPs that belong to CTc. 
    
   Notes: 
   (1) It is assumed that, in current operation, Reserved(LSP) = 
   Tspec(LSP). 
   (2) Generally, Reserved(LSPc) <= Requested(LSPc).  This is so that 
   LSPs of a class that can be overbooked reserve less than what their 
   corresponding service specifications explicitly call for.  
   Therefore, enough LSPs of that class can be admitted until the 
   capacity held for the expected carried load is reached.  
    
    
3. Overbooking in Aggregate TE 
    
   Two methods are in common use in existing TE: 
    
   1.      Link Size Overbooking (per-link) method: apply overbooking by 
     adjusting the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth of an individual link 
     (this parameter may be set by default to the Maximum Link 
     Bandwidth or may be configured by operator to some other value). 
   2.      LSP Size Overbooking (per-LSP) method: apply overbooking by 
     adjusting the size of an individual LSP. 
    
   Let us define: 
   LSOM = Link Size Overbooking multiplier 
   LSPOM = LSP Size Overbooking multiplier 
    
   Then, we have the following three application scenarios: 
    
   1. Link Size Overbooking only: 
   Reserved(LSP) = Tspec(LSP) = Requested(LSP) 
   Maximum Reservable Bandwidth = Maximum Link Bandwidth * LSOM 
    
   2. LSP Size Overbooking only: 
   Reserved(LSP) = Tspec(LSP) = Requested(LSP) / LSPOM 
   Maximum Reservable Bandwidth = Maximum Link Bandwidth 
    
   3. Both Link Size Overbooking and LSP Size Overbooking 
   simultaneously: 
   Reserved(LSP) = Tspec(LSP) = Requested(LSP) / LSPOM 
   Maximum Reservable Bandwidth = Maximum Link Bandwidth * LSOM 
    
   Since use of the above two overbooking methods does not result in 
   any specific protocol extensions, the parameters LSOM and LSPOM are 
   not signaled.  That is, they are conceptual parameters that do not

   need to be defined in any standards or carried in any signaling 
   protocols.  However, since they (or their equivalent parameters) 
   need to be configured, they are defined here for assessing the 
   *operational complexity* of the methods.  Also, they should be 
   documented explicitly to avoid possible misinterpretation that may 
   lead to operational errors. 
    
    
4. Overbooking in DS-TE 
    
   Since DS-TE is used if and only if the number of Class-Types is at 
   least 2, the germane overbooking method in DS-TE should be on a per-
   CT basis.  That is, to allow a different level of overbooking for 
   different CTs.  For example, service providers would typically use 
   high overbooking on best-effort traffic, and low overbooking on 
   premium data.  There are two cases: 
    
   @    Per-domain per-CT overbooking (i.e., applied on a network-wide 
     basis) 
   @    Per-link per-CT overbooking 
    
   Per-domain per-CT overbooking can be achieved by extending the LSP 
   size overbooking method of existing TE, i.e., by extending the 
   granularity of per-LSP overbooking to per-CT for scalability.  In 
   conjunction with Link Size Overbooking, it is possible to adjust the 
   per-CT overbooking on different links by the *same* proportion.  
   This is because Link Size Overbooking effectively applies a single 
   per-link overbooking that is common to all CTs. 
    
   Per-link per-CT overbooking is a new capability in DS-TE.  An 
   example of its use is when a network has a mixture of links with 
   different speeds.  In this case, depending on the relative traffic 
   size, per-CT overbooking may need to be *proportionally different*.  
   This is because different CTs may see different scaling effects when 
   link speeds change.  (See Appendix I for an example.) 
    
   As described above, DS-TE includes also the Link/LSP Size 
   Overbooking methods.  As these methods are directly inherited from 
   existing TE, minimal modification should be made to them to maintain 
   backward compatibility.  However, where they are not used by a 
   service provider, they should have *minimal impact* on the 
   operational complexity of the per-CT overbooking methods in DS-TE. 
    
    
5. Components-Based Approach 
    
   One approach is to simply provide each of the above methods as an 
   option and package them together, as commonly used in product 
   development.  This is the approach that was proposed during the 
   initial development of the DS-TE protocol extensions document [2].  
   The result is: 
    
   two mandatory components

Internet-Draft   Overbooking in Diffserv-aware MPLS TE       Jun 2003 
 
 
   . Link Size Overbooking 
   . LSP Size Overbooking 
    
   one optional component 
   . Local Overbooking Multiplier (LOM) 
    
   A new set of quantities is also introduced to factor in both the 
   Link/LSP Size Overbooking and the optional LOM method:  
    
   Normalised(LSPc) = Reserved(LSPc)/LOM(CTc), 
   Normalised(CTc) = Reserved(CTc)/LOM(CTc), 
   where LOM(CTc) is the Local Overbooking Multiplier for an LSPc 
   belonging to CTc. 
    
   By structuring the LOM method as an optional component over existing 
   components, as well as the use of the new "Normalized" quantities, 
   two sets of formulas are needed: with and without LOM. 
    
   As in the case of aggregate TE, let us define: 
   LSOM = Link Size Overbooking multiplier (unsignaled) 
   LSPOM(CTc) = LSP Size Overbooking multiplier (unsignaled) 
   LOM(CTc) = local overbooking multiplier (signaled) 
    
   Here again, LSOM and LSPOM(CTc) are defined only for assessing the 
   operational complexity of the components-based approach. 
    
   Then, we have the following four application scenarios: 
    
   1. Link Size Overbooking only: 
   Reserved(LSPc) = Tspec(LSPc) = Requested(LSPc) 
   Maximum Reservable Bandwidth = Maximum Link Bandwidth * LSOM 
   (Note that Link Size Overbooking does not enforce different 
   overbooking ratios for different CTs.) 
    
   2. LSP Size Overbooking only: 
   Reserved(LSPc) = Tspec(LSPc) = Requested(LSPc) / LSPOM(CTc) 
   Maximum Reservable Bandwidth = Maximum Link Bandwidth 
    
   3. Both Link Size Overbooking and LSP Size Overbooking 
   simultaneously: 
   Reserved(LSPc) = Tspec(LSPc) = Requested(LSPc) / LSPOM(CTc) 
   Maximum Reservable Bandwidth = Maximum Link Bandwidth * LSOM 
    
   4. LOM in conjunction with any of the above: 
   Normalized(LSPc) = Reserved(LSPc) / LOM(CTc) = Tspec(LSPc) / 
   LOM(CTc) 
   where Reserved(CTc) = Tspec(LSPc) is as defined in cases 1 to 3 
   above. 
    
   *Note that in case 4, the Reserved(LSPc) still equals Tspec(LSPc), 
   but Normalized(LSPc) is not a physical quantity corresponding to 
   reserved bandwidth, requested bandwidth, or Tspec bandwidth.* 
    
  
Ash, Lai                Category - Expiration                [Page 5] 
Internet-Draft   Overbooking in Diffserv-aware MPLS TE       Jun 2003 
 
 
   Because of the use of Normalized(LSPc), the aggregate constraints 
   are also different, depending on whether LOM is used or not.  The 
   use of Maximum Reservable Bandwidth as an aggregate constraint 
   tacitly assumes the use of Link Size Overbooking, which may or may 
   not be the case. 
    
    
6. An Integrated Approach 
    
   From the operational perspective of service providers, an integrated 
   approach is more desirable.  To minimize operational complexity, a 
   single set of formulas should be used in all application scenarios.  
   This objective can be achieved by defining a single parameter: 
    
   OB(CTc) = the overbooking factor for an LSPc belonging to CTc. 
    
   Then, for either per-domain per-CT overbooking or per-link per-CT 
   overbooking, we have 
    
   Tspec(LSPc) = Requested(LSPc) 
   Reserved(LSPc) = Tspec(LSPc) / OB(CTc) 
   Maximum Reservable Bandwidth = Maximum Link Bandwidth 
    
   *Note that the above reduction in Reserved(LSPc), i.e., by dividing 
   the Tspec(LSPc) bandwidth by the OB(CTc) overbooking, is a change 
   from current operation as assumed in Section 2.* 
    
   OB(CTc) is signaled when per-link per-CT overbooking is used, 
   otherwise it does not need to be signaled. 
    
   The above integrated formulation results in the use of a single 
   aggregate constraint: 
    
   SUM (Reserved(CTc)) <= Maximum Reservable Bandwidth = Maximum Link 
   Bandwidth 
     for all "c" in the range 0 <= c <= (MaxCT-1) 
    
   Observe that the per-link per-CT overbooking method basically 
   applies a different level of overbooking to each CT on different 
   links (e.g., higher overbooking on higher-speed links).  Thus, the 
   method itself already encompasses the capability of Link/LSP Size 
   Overbooking, and there is no need to account for them separately.  
   This leads to the feasibility of using only a single set of formulas 
   in the integrated approach.  Also note that Maximum Reservable 
   Bandwidth is not really needed, but may be retained for backward 
   compatibility. 
    
    
7. Functional Equivalence 
    
   To see how the integrated approach meets all the needs of the 
   different scenarios, let us define 
    
  
Ash, Lai                Category - Expiration                [Page 6] 
Internet-Draft   Overbooking in Diffserv-aware MPLS TE       Jun 2003 
 
 
   OB(CTc) = LSOM * LSPOM(CTc) * LOM(CTc) 
    
   We want to emphasize that we do not need this formula in operational 
   context.  It is solely used here to demonstrate that the integrated 
   approach is functionally equivalent to the components-based 
   approach. 
    
   Referring to the four application scenarios in the components-based 
   approach: 
    
   1. Link Size Overbooking only: 
   LSPOM(CTc) = 1, LOM(CTc) = 1, for all c 
   Reserved(LSPc) = Tspec(LSPc) / OB(CTc) = Requested(LSPc) / LSOM 
    
   2. LSP Size Overbooking only: 
   LSOM = 1, LOM(CTc) = 1, for all c 
   Reserved(LSPc) = Tspec(LSPc) / OB(CTc) = Requested(LSPc) / 
   LSPOM(CTc) 
    
   3. Both Link Size Overbooking and LSP Size Overbooking 
   simultaneously: 
   LOM(CTc) = 1, for all c 
   Reserved(LSPc) = Tspec(LSPc) / OB(CTc) = Requested(LSPc) / ( LSOM * 
   LSPOM(CTc) ) 
    
   4. LOM in conjunction with any of the above: 
   LSOM = 1, LSPOM(CTc) = 1, for all c 
   Reserved(LSPc) = Tspec(LSPc) / OB(CTc) = Requested(LSPc) / LOM(CTc) 
    
   Note that we no longer need the quantities Normalized(LSPc) and 
   Normalized(CTc).  Thus, with a more coherent and seamless 
   integration, it is possible to provide an overall simplification of 
   the rather complicated 3-way overbooking complexity in the 
   components-based approach, while retaining full backward compatible 
   with existing TE. 
    
   By avoiding the use of different options, parameters [3 parameters 
   (LSOM, LSPOM, LOM) versus 1 parameter (OB)], and formulas for 
   different situations, operational complexity is reduced.  This will 
   also help to reduce operational errors such as misconfigurations. 
    
   Also, note that since Link/LSP Size Overbooking is not needed in 
   per-link per-CT overbooking, the requirement that existing TE 
   overbooking should have minimal impact on DS-TE overbooking is 
   fulfilled. 
    
    
APPENDIX I: Example Use of Per-Link Per-CT Overbooking 
    
   Suppose link0 has 100 units (e.g., Mbps of link bandwidth), of which 
   say 30 is allocated to CT0, and 70 to CT1.  Similarly, link1 has 500 
   units, of which 150 is to CT0, and 350 to CT1.  That is, with 
   30%/70% allocation for both links, the bandwidth constraints are in 
  
Ash, Lai                Category - Expiration                [Page 7] 
Internet-Draft   Overbooking in Diffserv-aware MPLS TE       Jun 2003 
 
 
   the same proportion for both.  Then, in going from link0 to link1, 
   CT0 sees an increase from 30 to 150, while CT1 sees an increase from 
   70 to 350. 
    
   To get a feel for the change in per-CT overbooking needed for the 
   two links, we do a back-of-the-envelope calculation at a very high 
   level by using the simple Erlang formula, assuming 1% LSP blocking 
   for both CT0 and CT1.  (Obviously, this is very crude, without any 
   consideration for sharing - but the idea is to see the scaling 
   effect of link speeds, to be explained below.) 
    
    30 units support an offered load of  20.3 units (68% utilization) 
   150 units support an offered load of 131.6 units (88% utilization) 
    70 units support an offered load of  56.1 units (80% utilization) 
   350 units support an offered load of 326.2 units (93% utilization) 
    
   With only 30 units in link0, CT0 has a much smaller overbooking to 
   start with.  Thus, CT0 should see a proportionally bigger increase 
   in overbooking in link1, as the utilization increases by 20% from 
   68% to 88%. 
    
   On the other hand, CT1 has 70 units in link0 and can work with a 
   higher overbooking.  Thus, CT1 should see a proportionally smaller 
   increase in overbooking in link1, as the utilization increase is 
   much smaller, by 13% from 80% to 93%. 
    
   In summary, depending on the relative traffic size, per-CT 
   overbooking may need to be proportionally different.  This is 
   because different CTs may see different scaling effects when link 
   speeds change.  To support application scenarios like this, the use 
   of per-link per-CT is needed. 
    
    
APPENDIX II: Example 1 
    
   The proposed OB(CTc) would be configured by link, by CT, just as in 
   the current proposal for LOM(CTc).  However, OB(CTc) is meant to 
   combine, functionally: 
    
   LSPOMc = LSP overbooking multiplier for CTc 
   LSOM = link size overbooking multiplier for a given link 
   LOMc = local overbooking multiplier, per-link, per-CT adjustment 
   factor in the components-based approach 
    
   In the integrated approach, we define: 
    
   OBc = LSPOMc * LSOM * LOMc 
    
   Here is an example that compares today's method of overbooking (Case 
   A) and the proposed method of overbooking (Case B): 
    
   Take a link with:

Internet-Draft   Overbooking in Diffserv-aware MPLS TE       Jun 2003 
 
 
   Max link bandwidth = 100 
   Max reservable bandwidth = 200 
    
   (That is, in today's parlance, LSOM = 200/100 = 2, the link 
   bandwidth is overbooked by a factor of 2) 
    
   BC0 = 50 
   BC1 = 150 
   LSPOB0 = 1 
   LSPOB1 = 4 
    
   (That is, in today's parlance, CT0 is not overbooked, CT1 is 
   overbooked by a factor of 4) 
    
   LOM0 = 1 
   LOM1 = 1 
    
   (That is, in today's parlance, no per-link/per-CT overbooking 
   adjustment is made for either CT0 or CT1 using LOM) 
    
   Suppose we have 2 LSPs set up over this link: 
   LSP0 requested bandwidth = 30 
   LSP1 requested bandwidth = 80 
    
   Case A: today's way of applying overbooking factors: 
   ---------------------------------------------------- 
    
   Tspec(LSP0) = LSP0 requested bandwidth/LSPOB0 = 30/1 = 30 
   Tspec(LSP1) = LSP1 requested bandwidth/LSPOB1 = 80/4 = 20 
    
   Reserved(LSP0) = Tspec(LSP0) = 30 
   Reserved(LSP1) = Tspec(LSP1) = 20 
    
   Then 
    
   Unreserved(CT0) = BC0 - Reserved(CT0) = 50 - 30 = 20 
   Unreserved(CT1) = BC1 - Reserved(CT1) = 150 - 20 = 130 
    
   These quantities are advertised. 
    
    
   Case B: the proposed modified way of applying overbooking factors: 
   ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
    
   First we adjust the BC0 and BC1 by the LSOM for this link: 
    
   BC0 = 50/2 = 25 
   BC1 = 150/2 = 75 
   (Note that the proposed method uses Max link bandwidth as the 
   aggregate constraint) 
    
   Then we determine the OB0 and OB1 factors:

Internet-Draft   Overbooking in Diffserv-aware MPLS TE       Jun 2003 
 
 
   OB0 = LSPOB0 * LSOM * LOM0 = 1 * 2 * 1 = 2 
   OB1 = LSPOB1 * LSOM * LOM1 = 4 * 2 * 1 = 8 
    
   Tspec(LSP0) = LSP0 requested bandwidth = 30 
   Tspec(LSP1) = LSP1 requested bandwidth = 80 
    
   Reserved(LSP0) = Tspec(LSP0)/OB0 = 30/2 = 15 
   Reserved(LSP1) = Tspec(LSP1)/OB1 = 80/8 = 10 
    
   Then 
    
   Unreserved(CT0) = BC0 - Reserved(CT0) = 25 - 15 = 10 
   Unreserved(CT1) = BC1 - Reserved(CT1) = 75 - 10 = 65 
    
   These quantities are advertised.

   (That is, in today's parlance, LSOM = 200/100 = 2, the link 
   bandwidth is overbooked by a factor of 2) 
   BC0 = 50 
   BC1 = 150 
   LOM0 = 1 
   LOM1 = 4 
   (That is, in today's parlance, CT0 is not overbooked, CT1 is 
   overbooked by a factor of 4) 
   LSPOB0 = 1 
   LSPOB1 = 4 
   (That is, in today's parlance, no LSP overbooking factor is used, 
   instead the per-link/per-CT overbooking adjustment is made using 
   LOM) 
    
   Suppose we have 2 LSPs set up over this link: 
   LSP0 requested bandwidth = 30 
   LSP1 requested bandwidth = 80 
    
   Case A: today's way of applying overbooking factors: 
   ---------------------------------------------------- 
    
   Tspec(LSP0) = LSP0 requested bandwidth = 30 
   Tspec(LSP1) = LSP1 requested bandwidth = 80 
    
   Reserved(LSP0) = Tspec(LSP0) = 30 
   Reserved(LSP1) = Tspec(LSP1) = 80

Internet-Draft   Overbooking in Diffserv-aware MPLS TE       Jun 2003 
 
 
   Normalized(LSP0) = Reserved(LSP0)/LOM0 = 30/1 = 30 
   Normalized(LSP1) = Reserved(LSP1)/LOM1 = 80/4 = 20 
    
   Then 
    
   Unreserved(CT0) = BC0 - Normalized(CT0) = 50 - 30 = 20 
   Unreserved(CT1) = BC1 - Normalized(CT1) = 150 - 20 = 130 
 

   These quantities are advertised. 
    
    
   Case B: the proposed modified way of applying overbooking factors: 
   ------------------------------------------------------------------ 
    
   First we adjust the BC0 and BC1 by the LSOM for this link: 
    
   BC0 = 50/2 = 25 
   BC1 = 150/2 = 75 
   (note that the proposed method uses Max link bandwidth as the 
   aggregate constraint) 
    
   Then we determine the OB0 and OB1 factors: 
    
   OB0 = LSPOB0 * LSOM * LOM0 = 1 * 2 * 1 = 2 
   OB1 = LSPOB1 * LSOM * LOM1 = 1 * 2 * 4 = 8 
    
   Tspec(LSP0) = LSP0 requested bandwidth = 30 
   Tspec(LSP1) = LSP1 requested bandwidth = 80 
    
   Reserved(LSP0) = Tspec(LSP0)/OB0 = 30/2 = 15 
   Reserved(LSP1) = Tspec(LSP1)/OB1 = 80/8 = 10 
    
   Then 
    
   Unreserved(CT0) = BC0 - Reserved(CT0) = 25 - 15 = 10 
   Unreserved(CT1) = BC1 - Reserved(CT1) = 75 - 10 = 65 
    
   These quantities are advertised. 
    
    
8. Security Considerations 
    
   No new security considerations are raised by the overbooking methods 
   presented in this document; they are the same as in the DS-TE 
   Requirements document [1].
