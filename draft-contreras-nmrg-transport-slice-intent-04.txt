1.  Introduction

   Network slicing is emerging as the future model for service offering
   in telecom operator networks.  Conceptually, network slicing provides
   a customer with an apparent dedicated network built on top of logical
   (i.e. virtual) and/or physical functions and resources supported by a
   shared infrastructure, provided by one or more telecom operators.

   The concept of network slicing has been largely fostered by the
   advent of 5G services that are expected to be deployed on top of
   different kind of slices, each built to support specific
   characteristics (extreme low latency, high bandwidth, etc).

   As part of an end-to-end network slice it is expected to have a
   number of network slices at transport level (referred as IETF network
   slices) providing the necessary connectivity to the rest of
   components of the end-to-end slice, e.g., mobile packet core slice.

   For a definition of an IETF network slice refer to
   [I-D.nsdt-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition].  The following
   paragraph is directly taken from it: "An IETF Network Slice is a
   logical network topology connecting a number of endpoints with a set
   of shared or dedicated network resources, that are used to satisfy
   specific Service Level Objectives (SLOs)."

   Intent is a high-level, declarative goal that operates at the level
   of a network and services it provides, not individual devices.  It is
   used to define outcomes and high-level operational goals.

   In consequence, it seems very convenient to apply the intent-based
   mechanisms for the provision of IETF network slices, providing the
   adequate level of abstraction towards the transport network control
   and management planes.

   This document leverages current industry trends in the definition of
   end-to-end network slices.  The final objective is to describe
   intents that can be used to flexibly declare the operational aspects
   and goals of an IETF network slice, meaning that the customer could
   declare what kind of IETF network slice is needed (the outcome) and
   not how to achieve the goals of the IETF network slice.

2.  IETF network slice intent

   As stated in [I-D.irtf-nmrg-ibn-concepts-definitions], "Intent is a
   declaration of operational goals that a network should meet and
   outcomes that the network is supposed to deliver, without specifying
   how to achieve them.  Those goals and outcomes are defined in a
   manner that is purely declarative - they specify what to accomplish,
   not how to achieve it."

   When applied to transport networks, this implies that an intent for
   IETF network slices should provide the necessary abstraction with
   respect to implementation details, including the final devices (or
   resources) involved, and be focused on the characteristics and
   performance expectations related to it.

   With that intent it can be expected that the intent based system can
   fulfill and assure the requested IETF network slice, triggering
   initial configurations at the time of initial provisioning and
   corrective actions during the IETF network slice lifetime.

3.  Foundation of IETF network slice intents

   The industrial interest around 5G is accelerating network deployments
   and operational changes.

   With this respect, the GSMA has been developing a universal blueprint
   that can be used by any vertical customer to request the deployment
   of a network slice instance (NSI) based on a specific set of service
   requirements.  Such a blueprint is a network slice descriptor called
   Generic Slice Template (GST) [GSMA].  The GST contains multiple
   attributes that can be used to characterize a network slice.  A
   particular template filled with values generates a specific Network
   Slice Type(NEST).

   Such templates refer to the end-to-end network slice, including the
   transport part.  Despite the fact that some of the values would not

   have applicability for the transport network, others do.  An analysis
   of the relevant attributes is performed in
   [I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi].

   According to 3GPP propositions [TS28.541], an upper 3GPP Management
   System interacts with the transport network for establishing the
   necessary slices at the transport level.  Such interaction can be
   expected to happen using the IETF network slice intent, described to
   an intent-based system (IBS) in the transport network part.  Then,
   according to the intent lifecycle in
   [I-D.irtf-nmrg-ibn-concepts-definitions], the IBS, after recognizing
   the intent, will proceed to translate it in order to interact with a
   IETF network slice controller by using a NBI as proposed in
   [I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi].

4.  Mechanisms for translating IETF network slice intents

   This section describes approaches for implementing mechanisms to
   translate IETF network slice intents.

4.1.  Translation approaches and interaction with the upper systems

   A suite of mechanisms will be required to allow instantiation of the
   user's intent into a IETF network slice.  In order to be able to
   deliver an end2end Intent driven slice - a well defined set of
   context aware attributes that allow unambiguous instantiation of the
   intent should be agreed upon.  A combination of a structured set of
   attributes communicated between an IBN and an upper layer system with
   user input would allow an IBN to have intent modeled and reason about
   its completeness/validity.  Translation approaches and interaction
   with the upper systems might benefit from Natural Language Processing
   (NLP) technics that are needed for enabling high level expression of
   requirements found missing.  The goal would be to identify and
   classify the answers for as many fields as possible from the Generic
   Slice Template (GST), based on the free text / speech provided by the
   user.  As it is highly unlikely that the minimum set of fields to
   properly define an IETF network slice (geo-temporal characteristics,
   performance characteristics, SLO and SLA properties) will be
   fulfilled in this first step, a follow up two-step approach might
   need to be implemented.

   o  The minimum missing fields from the GST have to be identified and
      appropriate questions have to be generated (e.g. based on a pool
      of available questions correlated with each field, or based on AI
      approaches).

   o  An iterative interrogation phase will be initiated towards the
      user using the previously generated questions, until the user

Internet-Draft          IETF Network Slice Intent          November 2020


      provides all the missing information, so the intent can be modeled
      accordingly.

   Interaction with the user and higher-up systems can potentially be
   further improved by utilizing Machine Learning techniques.

4.2.  Intent-based system suite

   In order to consolidate on the set of devices, technologies and
   resources to be used, a combination of deterministic or stochastic
   computation approaches will be needed.  Deterministic approaches will
   rely on mathematical models and respective algorithms.  Stochastic
   approaches will rely on technologies like machine learning.  Their
   goal will be to learn from experience, so as to optimize future
   decisions from the viewpoint of speed and reliability.  The target of
   learning will be related to the service behavior and to the
   anticipated network status in the area and time period of the service
   provision.
