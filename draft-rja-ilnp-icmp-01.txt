Abstract

   This describes an experimental ICMPv6 message type used with the
   Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP).  This message can
   dynamically update Identifier/Locator bindings for an existing
   ILNP session.

1. Introduction

   At present, the research and development community are examining
   various alternatives for evolving the Internet Architecture.  Several
   different classes of evolution are being considered.  One class is
   often called "Map and Encapsulate", where traffic would be mapped and
   then tunnelled through the inter-domain core of the Internet.
   Another class being considered is sometimes known as
   "Identifier/Locator Split".  This document relates to a proposal that
   is in the latter class of evoluationary approaches.  In particular,
   the Identifier-Locator Network Protocol being described in this
   document and related Internet-Drafts is an evolution of IPv6. [ILNP-
   Intro] [ILNP-Nonce] [ILNP-DNS] [RFC 2460]

   The new ICMPv6 Locator Update message described in this document
   enables an enhanced node to update its correspondents about the
   currently valid set of Locators valid for use to reaching the node
   sending this message.

   This new ICMPv6 message MUST NOT be used for IP sessions operating in
   classic IPv6 mode; it MUST ONLY be used for IP sessions that are
   operating in Identifier/Locator Split mode.

   Some might consider any and all use of ICMP to be undesirable.  In
   that context, please note that while this specification uses ICMP,
   there is no architectural difference between using ICMP and using
   some different framing, for example UDP.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [RFC 2119]

2. Syntax

   ------------------------------------------------------------
   |  ICMP Type  |  ICMP Code    |        Checksum            |
   +-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
   | Num of Locs |     RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE                |
   +-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
   /                        Locator                           /
   +-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+


   ICMP Type:         This 8-bit field is set to the value XXX
                      to indicate that this is a Locator Update
                      message.


   ICMP Code:         This 8-bit field indicates which kind of
                      ICMP Locator Update this is.  At present,
                      the only valid value is 0, which means
                      that this message contains all currently
                      valid Locator values for the sending node.

   Checksum:          This contains the ICMPv6 Checksum value
                      for this packet.

   Num of Locs:       This field contains the number of 64-bit
                      Locators that follow the RESERVED field.
                      This field must not contain the number zero,
                      as each ILNP node needs to be reachable via
                      at least 1 Locator value.  Multi-homed nodes
                      will have at least 2 Locator values.

   Reserved:          This 24-bit field MUST be sent as zero.
                      At this time, recipients should ignore the
                      contents of this field, as these bits are

                      reserved for future use.

   Locator:           This 64-bit field contains a valid Locator
                      that can be used to reach the sending node.
                      A variable number of Locator fields are
                      concatenated one after another.  These are
                      listed in priority order, with the first
                      Locator field containing the most preferred
                      Locator value.

3.  Transport Protocol Effects

   This message has no impact on any transport protocol.

   The message may affect where packets for a given transport
   session are sent, but one of the design objectives for the
   I/L Split Mode  (ILNP) is to decouple transport-protocols
   from network-layer changes.

4. Implementation Considerations

   Implementers may use any internal implementation they wish,
   provided that the external appearance is the same as this
   implementation approach.

   To support the Identifier/Locator Split operating mode, and
   retain the incremental deployability and backwards compatibility
   needed, the network layer needs a mode bit in the Transport Control
   Block (or its equivalent) to track which IP sessions are using
   the classic IPv6 mode and which IP sessions are using the
   Identifier/Locator Split mode.

   Further, when in the Identifier/Locator Split mode, nodes will
   need to retain a Correspondent Cache in the network layer that
   contains for each correspondent node:
        - Source Identifier(s) in use
        - Source Locator(s) in use
        - Destination Identifier(s) in use
        - Destination Locator(s) in use
        - Session Nonce value from Local Node to Correspondent Node
        - Session Nonce value from Correspondent Node to Local Node

   Please also read the discussion of this Correspondent Cache in
   the companion document [ILNP-Intro].

5.  Backwards Compatibility

   For all sessions operating in Identifier/Locator Split mode,



Atkinson             Expires in 6 months                        [Page 4]

Internet Draft       ILNP ICMP            08 FEB 2010


   inside each node the high-order 64-bits ("Locator") are always
   set to zero before the packet is sent upwards to the transport
   protocol.  So any changes in Locator values used on the wire
   will be invisible to the transport protocol.  In this mode,
   transport-layer checksums (e.g.  TCP pseudo-header checksum)
   will be calculated with both Source Locator and Destination
   Locator fields set to all zero.

   For nodes or sessions not operating in Identifier/Locator Split
   mode, the ICMP Locator Update packet MUST be discarded
   by the recipient without being processed.

6. Security Considerations

   The ICMP Locator Update message MUST ONLY be used for IP sessions
   operating in the Identifier/Locator Split mode.

   The experimental Nonce Destination Option [ILNP-Nonce] MUST be
   present in packets containing an ICMPv6 Locator Update message.
   Further, the received Nonce Destination Option must contain the
   correct nonce value for the packet to be accepted by the recipient
   and then passed to the ICMPv6 protocol for processing.

   For sessions operating in higher risk environments, the use of
   the IP Authentication Header *in addition* to the experimental
   Nonce Destination Option is recommended.  Use of the IP
   Authentication Header to protect a packet does NOT permit the
   packet to be sent without the Nonce Destination Option.

   A broader discussion of ILNP Security Considerations is in
   [ILNP-Intro].

7. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a value, replacing the XXX, to the
   ICMP Type listed in Section 2, following the procedures in RFC
   4443.

   There are no other IANA actions for this document.
