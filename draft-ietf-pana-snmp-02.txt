Abstract

   The PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) does not necessarily act as an
   Enforcement Point (EP) to prevent unauthorized access or usage of the
   network.  When a PANA Client successfully authenticates itself to the
   PAA, EP(s) (e.g., access routers) will need to be suitably notified.

   The PANA working group mandates the use of Simple Network Management
   Protocol Version 3 (SNMPv3) to deliver the authorization information
   to one or more EPs when the PAA is separated from EPs.

   The present document provides the necessary information and
   extensions needed to use SNMPv3 as the PAA-EP protocol.

1.  Terminology and Definitions

   PANA: Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access.

   PaC (PANA Client):

      The client side of the protocol that resides in the host device,
      which is responsible for providing the credentials to prove its
      identity for network access authorization.  A PaC is responsible
      for requesting network access and engaging in authentication
      process using the PANA protocol.

   DI (Device Identifier):

      The identifier used by the network as a handle to control and
      police the network access of a client.  Depending on the access
      technology, this identifier might contain any of IP address,
      link-layer address, switch port number, etc.  of a connected
      device.

   PAA (PANA Authentication Agent):

      The access network (server) side entity of the PANA protocol.  A
      PAA is in charge of interfacing with the PaCs for authenticating
      and authorizing them for the network access service.  To this end,
      the PAA verifies the credentials provided by a PANA client and
      grants network access service to the device associated with the
      client and identified by a DI.
      The PAA is also responsible for updating the access control state
      (i.e., filters) depending on the creation and deletion of the
      authorization state.  The PAA communicates the updated state to
      the enforcement points in the network.  When the PAA and the EP
      are separated, a protocol is required to carry the authorized
      client attributes from the PAA to the EP.  SNMP is mandated for
      this task.

   EP (Enforcement Point):

      A node on the access network where per-packet enforcement policies
      (i.e., filters) are applied on the inbound and outbound traffic of
      client devices.  The EP uses non-cryptographic or cryptographic
      filters to selectively allow and discard data packets.  These
      filters may be applied at the link-layer or the IP-layer.  An EP
      learns the attributes of the authorized clients (DI and
      (optionally) cryptographic keys) from the PAA.

2.  Introduction

2.1  PAA/EP separation context

   PANA enables access control by identifying legitimate clients and
   generating filtering information for access control mechanisms.
   [I-D.ietf-pana-framework] defines a general AAA and access control
   framework.  The PANA protocol itself provides client authentication
   and authorization functionality for securing network access.  The
   other component of a complete solution is the access control which
   ensures that only authenticated and authorized clients can gain
   access to the network.

   Access control can be achieved by placing EPs (Enforcement Points) in
   the network for policing the traffic flow.  EPs should prevent data
   traffic from and to any unauthorized client unless it's either PANA
   or one of the other allowed traffic types (e.g., ARP, IPv6 neighbor
   discovery, DHCP, etc.).

   Figure 1 below illustrates the functional entities and the interfaces
   (protocols, APIs) among them.

                                              RADIUS/
                                              Diameter/

      IKE/ +-------->| EP  |<--------+ SNMP/ API
   4-way handshake   +-----+

                    Figure 1: PANA Functional Model

   Some of the entities may be co-located depending on the deployment
   scenario.

   The EP on the access network allows general data traffic from any
   authorized PaC, whereas it allows only limited type of traffic (e.g.,
   PANA, DHCP, router discovery) for the unauthorized PaCs.  This
   ensures that the newly attached clients have the minimum access
   service to engage in PANA and get authorized for the unlimited
   service.

   If the PaC is authorized to gain the access to the network, the PAA
   also sends the PaC-specific attributes (e.g., IP address,
   cryptographic keys, etc.) to the EP by using SNMP.  The EP uses this

   information to enforce policy rules allowing data traffic from and to
   the PaC to pass through.

   In case a cryptographic access control needs to be enabled after the
   PANA authentication, a secure association protocol runs between the
   PaC and the EP.  The PaC should already have the input parameters to
   this process as a result of the successful PANA exchange.  Similarly,
   the EP should have obtained them from the PAA via SNMP.  Secure
   association exchange produces the required security associations
   between the PaC and the EP to enable per-packet protection.

   Finally data traffic can start flowing from and to the newly
   authorized PaC.

2.2  Scope

   Section 3 gives references for the SNMP framework.

   Section 4 provides a general statement with regards to the
   applicability of SNMP as the PAA-EP protocol.

   IPSec MIB modules were found to have general applicability and
   varying levels of re-usability for PANA EP configuration using SNMP.
   Section 5 details the applicability of this MIB set to the EP
   configuration.

   Section 6 provides usage examples of these MIB modules in the context
   of PANA.

   Section 7 defines some additional PANA-specific objects that extend
   the IPSec SPD-MIB module [I-D.ietf-ipsp-spd-mib] in order to entirely
   satisfy the PAA-EP interface requirements.

   Finally, Section 9 addresses the security considerations.

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58
   [RFC2578], STD 58 [RFC2579] and STD 58 [RFC2580].

4.  SNMP Applicability with the PANA framework

   This section provides a general statement with regards to the
   applicability of SNMP as the PAA-EP protocol.  This analysis of SNMP
   is specific to SNMPv3, which provides the security required for PANA
   usage.  SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c would be inappropriate for PANA since they
   have been declared Historic, and because their messages have only
   trivial security.

4.1  SNMPv3 General applicability

   The primary advantages of SNMPv3 are that it is a mature, well
   understood protocol, currently deployed in various scenarios, with
   mature toolsets available for SNMP managers and agents.

   Application intelligence is captured in MIB modules, rather than in
   the messaging protocol.  MIB modules define a data model of the
   information that can be collected and configured for a managed
   functionality.  The SNMP messaging protocol transports the data in a
   standardized format without needing to understand the semantics of
   the data being transferred.  The endpoints of the communication
   understand the semantics of the data.

   Partly due to the lack of security in SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, and partly
   due to variations in configuration requirements across vendors, few
   MIB modules have been developed that enable standardized
   configuration of managed devices across vendors.  Since monitoring
   can be done using only a least-common-denominator subset of
   information across vendors, many MIB modules have been developed to
   provide standardized monitoring of managed devices.  As a result,
   SNMP has been used primarily for monitoring rather than for
   configuring network nodes.

   SNMPv3 builds upon the design of widely-deployed SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c
   versions.  Specifically, SNMPv3 shares the separation of data
   modeling (MIBs) from the protocol to transfer data, so all existing
   MIBs can be used with SNMPv3.  SNMPv3 also uses the SMIv2 standard,
   and it shares operations and transport with SNMPv2c.  The major
   difference between SNMPv3 and earlier versions is the addition of
   strong message security and controlled access to data.

   SNMPv3 uses the architecture detailed in [RFC3411], where all SNMP
   entities are capable of performing certain functions, such as the
   generation of requests, response to requests, the generation of
   asynchronous notifications, the receipt of notifications, and the
   proxy-forwarding of SNMP messages.  SNMP is used to read and
   manipulate virtual databases of managed-application-specific
   operational parameters and statistics, which are defined in MIB

   modules.

4.2  Compliancy of SNMP against the PANA requirements

   The following sections detail how the PAA-EP protocol requirements
   are fully supported by SNMP:

4.2.1  Authorization Consideration

   This section discusses PAA-EP communication in terms of authorization
   aspects.

   Binary Authorization:

      Filtering rules to be installed on EP generally include a device
      identifier of PaC, and also a cryptographic keying material (e.g.,
      IKE [RFC2409] pre-shared key ) when cryptographic data traffic
      protection is needed.  Each keying material is uniquely identified
      with a keying material name (e.g., ID_KEY_ID in IKE) and has a
      lifetime for key management, accounting, access control and
      security reasons in general.

      PANA management can be modeled in a way that is consistent with
      existing standard MIB modules, this is detailed in Section 5.
      Additional PANA-specific objects may be needed and are defined in
      Section 7.

   Profile-based authorization:

      In addition to the device identifier and keying material, the PAA
      may provide the EP with additional authorization information.  For
      instance, a user may be authorized to access the network within a
      given class of service or for a maximum amount of units.  The type
      of units can be time (e.g., authorization lifetime), volume (e.g.,
      the number of incoming and/or outgoing packets and/or bytes),
      service specific or money depending on the type of service event
      [I-D.ietf-aaa-diameter-cc].

      There are two possible models to support this type of
      authorization:

      *  In the polling model, the PAA (most probably) periodically
         sends queries to its EP(s) on the current amount of units used
         by each PaC.

      *  In the notification model, the PAA sends the maximum amount
         units to EP(s) when a PaC is successfully authenticated and
         authorized, and waits notification events from EP(s).  The



El Mghazli, et al.       Expires April 22, 2005                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      SNMP usage for PAA-EP interface         October 2004


         notification events are sent by EP(s) when a PaC has spent the
         maximum amount of units.  With the use of SNMPv3 as the PAA-EP
         protocol, the polling and notification models are supported by
         SNMP get and notification operations, respectively.

      This type of authorization might also require that the
      communicating pair of PAA and EP to detect a dead or rebooted peer
      in order to avoid possible inaccurate accounting.  This aspect is
      discussed in Section 4.2.6.

      In any case, even if it is very likely to occur between the PAA
      and EP, this kind of profile-based authorization is beyond the
      scope of the PANA working group.  Hence, the specification of the
      MIB modules (existing or not) necessary to provide such policy
      information is outside the scope of the present document, which
      deals only with the so-called binary authorization.

4.2.2  PAA-EP relation

   A number of deployment options are envisaged within the PANA
   framework.  See [I-D.ietf-pana-framework] for further details.

   The SNMP framework [RFC3410] supports one-to-many, many-to-one, and
   many-to-many relationships between the SNMP managers (PAAs) and
   agents (EPs).

4.2.3  Secure Communication

   SNMPv3 includes the User-based Security Model (USM, [RFC3414]), which
   provides authentication, confidentiality, and integrity.

   Additionally, USM has specific built-in mechanisms for preventing
   replay attacks including unique protocol engine IDs, timers and
   counters per engine and time windows for the validity of messages.

   See [RFC3410] for the security features provided by the SNMPv3
   framework.

4.2.4  Notification of PaC presence

   The PaC may also choose to start sending packets before getting
   authenticated.  In that case, the network should detect this and the
   PAA must send an unsolicited PANA-Start-Request message to the PaC.
   The EP is the node that can detect such activity.  In case they are
   separate, there needs to be an explicit message to prompt the PAA.

   Such a presence notification is done by using the SNMP notification
   operation.  See Section 5.3 for details on how new and existing SNMP

Internet-Draft      SNMP usage for PAA-EP interface         October 2004


   objects provide this feature.

4.2.5  Accounting Consideration

   Since authentication and authorization are closely related to
   accounting in many cases, accounting aspects need to be considered in
   the PAA-EP protocol.  There are logically two models with regard to
   where the accounting client is located.

   o  In the first model, the accounting client is co-located with PAA.
      The PAA device acts as an accounting client of a AAA protocol.
      The PAA collects accounting information from the EP(s) it
      controls, and sends the gathered data to the accounting server by
      using the AAA protocol.  In the case where accounting is performed
      in usage basis, i.e., the number of transmitted/received
      octets/packets, the PAA-EP protocol also needs to carry these
      usage data.

   o  In the second model, the accounting client is co-located with the
      EP.  In this model, the EP device acts as an accounting client of
      a AAA protocol.  The EP obtains the authentication/authorization
      session identifier for each PaC from the PAA, where the
      authentication/authorization session identifier is assigned by a
      AAA protocol running on the PAA, and sends the accounting
      information directly to the accounting server by using the AAA
      protocol, without sending the accounting information to the PAA.

   The authentication/authorization session identifier of a AAA protocol
   is used by the accounting server to associate accounting information
   with a particular authentication/authorization session to calculate
   bills.  The authentication/authorization session identifier may or
   may not be the same as the PANA session identifier.

   Both models might need for the communicating pair of the PAA and the
   EP to detect a dead or rebooted peer to avoid possible inaccurate
   accounting.  This aspect is discussed in Section 4.2.6.

4.2.6  Peer Liveness Test and Rebooted Peer Detection

   PAA-EP protocol implementations need to be stateful, when considering
   the authorization and accounting aspects as described in the previous
   sections.  The stateful nature provides the functionality to detect a
   dead or rebooted peer in a timely fashion.  On the other hand, this
   does not mean that the PAA-EP protocol itself needs to be stateful.
   For example, an SNMP entity (i.e., an SNMP engine plus SNMP
   applications) can generate SNMP queries on a particular MIB at an
   interval short enough to perform peer liveness test and rebooted peer
   detection.

Internet-Draft      SNMP usage for PAA-EP interface         October 2004


   Also, the peer liveness test and rebooted peer detection need to be
   performed securely.

   When SNMPv3 is used as the PAA-EP protocol, the SNMP management
   framework supports snmpEngineBoots MIB [RFC3411].  By periodically
   sending SNMP query to the peer to check the current value of this MIB
   with the use of SNMP Security Subsystem, it is possible for an SNMP
   entity to securely perform peer liveness test and rebooted peer
   detection between PAA and EP.

   When a PAA finds a dead or rebooted EP, the PAA should immediately
   terminate PANA sessions for PaCs that are authorized for access
   through the EP.

5.  Applicability of IPSec configuration MIBs

   This section details the applicability of existing IPSec
   configuration MIB modules to the EP configuration.  These were found
   to have general applicability and a fair level of re-usability for
   the PANA EP configuration:

   IPSec Security Policy Database (SPD) MIB:
      [I-D.ietf-ipsp-spd-mib] defines a MIB module for configuration of
      an IPSec Security Policy Database (SPD).  No IPSec or IKE specific
      actions are defined within this document.

   IPSec IKE Action MIB:
      [I-D.ietf-ipsp-ikeaction-mib] defines a MIB module for
      configuration of an IKE action within the IPSec SPD.

   The IPSec Configuration MIBs set does not define MIB modules for
   monitoring the state of an IPSec device.  Neither it does define MIB
   modules for configuring other policy related actions.  The purpose of
   these MIBs is to allow administrators to be able to configure policy
   with respect to the IPSec [RFC2401]/IKE [RFC2409] protocols.

5.1  General Access Control

   The EP enforces binary authorization by filtering data traffic on the
   basis of the Device Identifier (DI) of the PaC.  The PAA must
   provision its EPs with DI-based filters in order to control and
   police the network access of a PaC.  According to the definition of
   the Device Identifier in [I-D.ietf-pana-requirements], such filters -
   depending on the access technology - might be either a IPv4/6 address
   or a link-layer address of a connected device.  Do note also that a
   keying material might be provisioned.  The particular case where
   access control is performed using IPSec is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec].  The configuration aspects are detailed in
   Section 5.2.

   The IPSec SPD MIB module (SPD-MIB) is designed to configure an IPSec
   security policy database in a policy and rule oriented fashion.  This
   module is divided into 3 portions (Rules, Filters, Actions).
   Specifically, SPD-MIB provides a generic mechanism for performing
   packet processing based on a rule set.

   The policy-based packet filtering and the corresponding execution of
   actions is of a more general nature than for IPSec configuration
   only, such as for configuration of a firewall.  Rules within the
   IPSec SPD-MIB are generic and simply bind a filter to an action.
   Filters provided within the SPD-MIB itself are numerous and fairly
   complete for most common packet filtering usage but externally

   defined filters are supported.

   Below are basic DI-based filters and static actions that are used --
   together with the other SPD tables -- to enforce binary packet
   authorization at the EP:

   -- Ipv4/v6 address-based filter:

      For Ipv4/v6 address-based filters provisioning, the IPSec SPD-MIB
      provides means to filter the traffic based on the IP header
      information.  SPD-MIB "spdIpHeaderFilter" table provides such
      facilities: one can define the various tests that are used when
      evaluating a given IP packet.  The various tests definable in this
      table are as follows:

      *  Source Address Match
      *  Destination Address Match
      *  Source Port Range Match
      *  Destination Port Range Match
      *  Protocol Match
      *  IPv6 Flow Label Match (Ipv6 only)

      The results of each test are ANDed together to produce the result
      of the entire filter.

   -- L2 address-based filter:

      [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] says the Device-Id AVP (code 1025) is of
      Address Type [RFC3588].  The content for link-layer addresses is
      expected to be specified in specific documents that describe how
      IP operates over different link-layers.  For instance, [RFC2464].
      To this end, additional filters are designed in the present
      document.  Section 7 defines a link-layer filter table, which test
      the L2 address (e.g.  MAC address, port, DSL line) of a given
      packet.
      Do note that the definition of this table does not assume the
      usage of any particular Link layer.

   -- Static Actions:

      The actions encapsulated within the SPD-MIB module are basic
      drop/accept actions.  These are sufficient to perform EP general
      binary authorization enforcement at the EP.
      When profile-based authorization information is provided to the
      EP, more advanced actions like classifiers, meters and schedulers
      might be configured by the PAA.  This is out of the scope of the
      present document.

5.2  Network Layer Secure Access Control (IPSec)

   The PANA protocol authenticates the client and also establishes a
   PANA security association between the PANA client and PANA
   authentication agent at the end of successful authentication.  The
   PAA indicates the results of the authentication using the
   PANA-Bind-Request (PBR) message wherein it can indicate the access
   control method enforced by the access network and the IP address of
   the corresponding EP.

   When IPSec is used to perform access control, the PANA protocol
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] does not discuss any details of IPSec [RFC2401]
   SA establishment.  Indeed, [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec] discusses the
   details for establishing an IPSec security association between the
   PaC and the EP.  When the IPSec SA is successfully established, it
   can be used to enforce access control and specifically used to
   prevent the service theft mentioned in [I-D.ietf-pana-threats-eval].

   In this particular context, one assumes that the following have
   already happened before the IPSec SA is established:

   1.  PANA client (PaC) and PAA mutually authenticate each other using
       EAP methods that derive the AAA-Key [I-D.ietf-eap-keying].
   2.  PaC learns the IP address of the Enforcement point (EP) during
       the PANA exchange.
   3.  PaC learns that the network uses IPSec [RFC2401] for securing the
       link between PaC and EP during the PANA exchange (PBR message).
   4.  PaC configures an IP address address before the PANA protocol
       begins (the pre-PANA Address (PRPA), see [I-D.ietf-pana-pana]).


   The IPSec IKE Action MIB module (IKEACTION-MIB) works within the
   framework of the IPSec SPD-MIB.  It can be referenced as an action by
   the SPD-MIB and is used to configure IKE negotiations between network
   devices.  Hence, together with the SPD-MIB, the IKEACTION-MIB module
   enables the PAA to configure IPSEC-based access control at the EP.

   The PAA is then responsible to communicate to EP the following
   information before IKE phase 1 exchange begins between PaC and EP:

   The IKE pre-shared key:
      To this end, the PAA must set a row in the IKE Credential Filter
      table of the IKEACTION-MIB.  This table defines filters, which can
      be used to match credentials of IKE peers, where the credentials
      in question have been obtained from an IKE phase 1 exchange.  They
      may be X.509 certificates, Kerberos tickets, or Pre-shared keys,
      etc.

   The PRPA of the PaC:
      An IP Header Filter of the SPD-MIB is used for configuring the SPD
      in a similar manner than what is described in Section 5.1.

   The Key-Id and PANA session ID:
      [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec] states that Pac and EP should use the PANA
      session ID concatenated with the AAA-key as the value of the
      ID_KEY_ID in aggressive mode for establishing the phase 1 SA.
      Section 6 details usage examples that illustrate the way the
      IKEACTION-MIB is used for this purpose.

5.3  Notification of PaC presence

   The SPD-MIB provides a means to notify to the SNMP manager (PAA)
   information on packets matching/not matching the filters of given
   rule.  Such notification mechanisms and objects can be re-used for
   notifying the PAA that unauthorized packets are trying to pass
   through the EP.

   Section 7 defines new notifications, which aims at satisfying this
   requirement.  It re-uses existing notification variable objects
   pre-defined in the SPD-MIB.

   These "New PaC" notifications (panaNewPacIPNotification and
   panaNewPaCL2Notification) are triggered when the the EP detects
   traffic coming from an unauthorized source.

   If the traffic detected is an IP flow, the objects sent must include
   spdIPSourceType, spdIPSourceAddress, spdIPDestinationType, and
   spdIPDestinationAddress objects to indicate the packet source and
   destination of the packet that triggered the action.  Additionally,
   the spdIPInterfaceType and spdIPInterfaceAddress objects are included
   to indicate which interface the action was executed in association
   with and if the packet was inbound or outbound through the endpoint.
   See [I-D.ietf-ipsp-spd-mib] for further details.

   If the traffic detected is Link-layer traffic, the objects sent must
   include the index of the interface which detected such traffic and
   potentially the L2 address source of the traffic.  See Section 7 for
   further details.

6.  EP Configuration Example

   Below are usage examples of the IPSec modules in the PANA context.

6.1  General IP-based Access Control

   Below is a usage example of the IPSec modules.  In this example, we
   need to configure the SPD so that EP accepts IP packets coming
   from/going to the PaC.

   The "EndPoint to Group" table is used to map policy (groupings) onto
   an endpoint (EP-ADDR is the IP address) where traffic is to pass by.
   Any policy group assigned to an endpoint is then used to control
   access to the traffic passing by it.

   So far, we define below two policy groups at the EP interface
   ("EP-SPD-IN" and "EP-SPD-OUT").

   spdEndpointToGroupTable.1 =
      spdEndGroupDirection = incoming;
      spdEndGroupIdentType = IPv4;
      spdEndGroupAddress   = EP-ADDR;
      spdEndGroupName      = "EP-SPD-IN";

   spdEndpointToGroupTable.2 =
      spdEndGroupDirection = outgoing;
      spdEndGroupIdentType = IPv4;
      spdEndGroupAddress   = EP-ADDR;
      spdEndGroupName      = "EP-SPD-OUT";

   Within each of the policy group defined above, we define a rule
   dedicated to the treatment of packets coming from/going to "PaC1" and
   the EP we are provisioning.

   spdGroupContentsTable.2 =
      spdGroupContName          = "EP-SPD-IN";
      spdGroupContPriority      = 1;
      spdGroupContFilter        = spdIpHeaderFilterTable.1;
      spdGroupContComponentType = rule;
      spdGroupContComponentName = "EP-PaC1-IN";

   spdGroupContentsTable.2 =
      spdGroupContName          = "EP-SPD-OUT";
      spdGroupContPriority      = 1;
      spdGroupContFilter        = spdIpHeaderFilterTable.2;
      spdGroupContComponentType = rule;
      spdGroupContComponentName = "EP-PaC1-OUT";

Internet-Draft      SNMP usage for PAA-EP interface         October 2004


   We define two filters in the "IP Header filter" table: one match IP
   packets coming from the PaC, the other match IP packets going to the
   PaC.

   spdIpHeaderFilterTable.1 =
      spdIpHeadFiltName            = "PaC1-IP@ Filter SOURCE";
      spdIpHeadFiltType            = { sourceAddress ON };
      spdIpHeadFiltIPVersion       = v4;
      spdIpHeadFiltSrcAddressBegin = PaC1-IP@;
      spdIpHeadFiltSrcAddressEnd   = PaC1-IP@;

   spdIpHeaderFilterTable.2 =
      spdIpHeadFiltName            = "PaC1-IP@ Filter DEST";
      spdIpHeadFiltType            = { destAddress ON };
      spdIpHeadFiltIPVersion       = v4;
      spdIpHeadFiltSrcAddressBegin = PaC1-IP@;
      spdIpHeadFiltSrcAddressEnd   = PaC1-IP@;

   The "Rule Defininition" table links a rule with a given action in the
   SPD action MIB.  E.g.  the following entries links the two filters
   defined above with the "accept" action statically defined in the SPD
   MIB (spdStaticActions.3).

   spdRuleDefinitionTable.1 =
      spdRuleDefName          = "PaC1-ACCEPT-IN";
      spdRuleDefDescription   = "Allow Incoming IP packets from PaC1";
      spdRuleDefFilter        = spdIpHeaderFilterTable.1;
      spdRuleDefFilterNegated = false (default);
      spdRuleDefAction        = spdStaticActions.3;

   spdRuleDefinitionTable.2 =
      spdRuleDefName          = "PaC1-ACCEPT-OUT";
      spdRuleDefDescription   = "Allow Outgoing IP packets to PaC1";
      spdRuleDefFilter        = spdIpHeaderFilterTable.2;
      spdRuleDefFilterNegated = false (default);
      spdRuleDefAction        = spdStaticActions.3;

   This means that any packet coming from/going to the PaC is now
   allowed to go through the EP (via EP-ADDR endpoint).

6.2  IPSec-based Access Control

   In this section we consider the case when IPSec is used to control
   access at the IP level.  In order to avoid many redundancies, the
   previous configuration set is still valid.  See below a usage example
   of IKEACTION-MIB.

   -- IKE Phase 1 configuration (agressive mode):

Internet-Draft      SNMP usage for PAA-EP interface         October 2004


   We define a rule in policy group "EP-SPD-IN" of the SPD MIB, using
   the "Group contents" table.  This rule is dedicated to all IKE phase
   1 traffic coming to the EP on this interface:

   spdGroupContentsTable.1 =
      spdGroupContName          = "EP-SPD-IN";
      spdGroupContPriority      = 1;
      spdGroupContFilter        = ipiaStaticFilters.1;
      spdGroupContComponentType = sub-group;
      spdGroupContComponentName = "EP-IKE-Phase1-IN";

   And within this IKE-specific policy sub-group we now specify the rule
   to apply for the IKE traffic coming from PaC1.

   spdGroupContentsTable.2 =
      spdGroupContName          = "EP-IKE-Phase1-IN";
      spdGroupContPriority      = 1;
      spdGroupContFilter        = spdIpHeaderFilterTable.1;
      spdGroupContComponentType = rule;
      spdGroupContComponentName = "PaC1-IKE-RULE";

   The spdIpHeaderFilterTable.1 entry has been defined in the previous
   seciton.

   The "Rule Defininition" table links a rule with a given action in the
   IKE action MIB.  This action will be triggereed upon reception at the
   EP of an IKE packet coming from PaC1.

   spdRuleDefinitionTable.3 =
      spdRuleDefName          = "PaC1-IKE-RULE";
      spdRuleDefDescription   = "IPSec Access Control for PaC1";
      spdRuleDefFilter        = spdIpHeaderFilterTable.1;
      spdRuleDefFilterNegated = false (default);
      spdRuleDefAction        = spdIkeActionTable.1;

   The "IKE action" entry below specifies the main parameters for the
   IKE exchanges.

   ipiaIkeActionTable.1 =
      ipiaIkeActName                 = "PaC1-IKE";
      ipiaIkeActParametersName       = "SA-PaC1";
      ipiaIkeActThresholdDerivedKeys = 100 (default);
      ipiaIkeActExchangeMode         = aggressive;
      ipiaIkeActAgressiveModeGroupId = xxx [Diffie-Hellman values];
      ipiaIkeActIdentityType         = id_Key_Id;
      ipiaIkeActIdentityContext      = "PANA";
      ipiaIkeActPeerName             = "PaC1";

   ipiaSaNegotiationParametersTable.1 =
      ipiaSaNegParamName               = "SA-PaC1";
      ipiaSaNegParamMinLifetimeSecs    = xxx;
      ipiaSaNegParamMinLifetimeKB      = xxx;
      ipiaSaNegParamRefreshThreshSecs  = xxx;
      ipiaSaNegParamRefreshThresholdKB = xxx;
      ipiaSaNegParamIdleDurationSecs   = xxx;

   The "Peer Identity" table specifically informs the EP on the value of
   the idKeyId to use in IKE messages with PaC1:

   ipiaPeerIdentityFilterTable.1 =
      ipiaPeerIdFiltName          = "PaC1";
      ipiaPeerIdFiltIdentityType  = id_key_id;
      ipiaPeerIdFiltIdentityValue = "PANA-Session-Id|PANA-Key-Id";

   The following entry links a given identity (PaC1) with an entry in
   the "Credentials" table.

   ipiaIkeIdentityTable.1 =
      spdEndGroupIdentType      = IPv4;
      spdEndGroupAddress        = EP-ADDR;
      ipiaIkeActIdentityType    = id_key_id;
      ipiaIkeActIdentityContext = PANA;
      ipiaIkeIdCredentialName   = "PaC1-PSK";

   Finally the pre-shared key derivated at the PAA is set here:

   ipiaCredentialFilterTable.1 =
      ipiaCredFiltName            = "PaC1-PSK";
      ipiaCredFiltCredentialType  = sharedSecret;
      ipiaCredFiltMatchFieldName  = none;
      ipiaCredFiltMatchFieldValue = "PSK-from-PAA";

8.  Open Issues

8.1  Security Issue on PaC presence notification

   It has been reported that the PANA-specific notification of PaC
   presence could be used to overwhelm an SNMP application, thus
   creating a DoS attack on the management of the network.  A attacker
   could detect that such notifications are sent by multiple devices,
   and the attacker could deliberately send lots of traffic through the
   devices.

8.2  MIB usage example

   The MIB usage example (Section 6) needs to be further developped with
   the support of the IPSP working group.

8.3  Link-layer protection support

   [I-D.ietf-pana-framework] envisages the case, where enabling
   link-layer ciphering (e.g.  [802.11i]) or network-layer ciphering
   might rely on PANA authentication.  The user and network then have to
   make sure an appropriate EAP method that can generate required keying
   materials is used.  Once the keying material is available, it needs
   to be provided to the EP(s) for use with ciphering.

   Network-layer ciphering configuration, i.e., IPsec, including IKE
   configuration is fully supported in the present document.

   However link-layer ciphers control is not supported yet.  The PANA
   working group must define the L2 techniques supported (e.g.[802.11i])
   for realizing this feature and the present document should take it
   into account.

9.  Security Considerations

   The MIB defined in the present document relates to a system which
   will provide network access.  As such, improper manipulation of the
   objects represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a
   large number of end-users.  In addition, manipulation of the
   panaL2FilterTable and spdIpHeaderFilterTable may allow an end-user to
   gain network access, spoof their IP addresses, change the authorized
   device identifiers, or affect other end-users in either a positive or
   negative manner.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The use of panaIPL2FilterTable to specify which Link-layer
      addresses are authorized to access the network is considered to be
      only limited protection and does not protect against attacks which
      spoof the management station's IP address.  The use of SNMPv3
      security is mandated.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be
      used with any v3 agent which implements this MIB.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
