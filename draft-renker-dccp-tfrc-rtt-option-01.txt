                  draft-renker-dccp-tfrc-rtt-option-01

Abstract

   This document describes an update to CCID-3/4 that addresses
   parameter-estimation problems occurring with TFRC-based DCCP
   congestion control.

   The fix uses a recommendation made in the original TFRC
   specification.  It avoids the inherent problems of receiver-based RTT
   sampling, by utilising higher-accuracy RTT samples already available
   at the sender.  It is integrated into the feature set of DCCP as an
   end-to-end negotiable extension, upward and downward compatible.

Internet-Draft     Sender RTT Estimate Option for DCCP       August 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document lists and analyses problems observed with receiver-
   based RTT sampling in the actual implementation of TFRC congestion
   control [RFC4342], [RFC5622].

   To fix these problems, this document presents a solution based on a
   concept first recommended in [RFC5348], 3.2.1; i.e. to measure the
   RTT at the sender.  This results in a higher reliability and
   frequency of samples, and avoids the inherent problems of receiver-
   based RTT sampling discussed below.

   We begin by listing the encountered problems in the next section.
   The proposed solution is presented in in Section 3.  We then discuss
   security considerations in Section 4 and list the resulting IANA
   considerations in Section 5.

2.  Problems caused by sampling the RTT at the receiver

   There are at least six areas that make a TFRC receiver vulnerable to
   inaccuracies or absence of (receiver-based) RTT samples:

   o  the measured sending rate, X_recv ([RFC5348], 6.2);

   o  synthesis of the first loss interval ([RFC5348], 6.3.1);

   o  disambiguation of loss events ([RFC4342], 10.2);

   o  validation of loss intervals ([RFC4342], 6.1);

   o  ensuring that at least one feedback packet is sent per RTT
      ([RFC4342], 10.3);

   o  determining quiescence periods ([RFC4342], 6.4).

2.1.  List of problems encountered with a real implementation

   This section summarizes several years of experience using the Linux
   implementation of CCID-3 and CCID-4.  It lists the problems
   encountered with receiver-based RTT sampling over real networks, in a
   variety of wired and wireless environments and under different link-
   layer conditions.

   The Linux DCCP/TFRC implementation is based on the RTT-sampling
   algorithm specified in [RFC4342], 8.1.  This algorithm relies on a
   coarse-grained window-counter (units of RTT/4), and uses packet
   inter-arrival times to estimate the current RTT of the network.

   The algorithm is effective only for packets with modulo-16 CCVal
   differences between 2 and 4 (corresponding to RTT/2, 3/4RTT, and
   RTT).  This limitation is noted in sections 8.1 and 10.3 of
   [RFC4342].

   A second problem arises when there are holes in the sequence space.
   Because there may be wrap-around of the 4-bit CCVal window counter,
   it is not possible to determine window-counter wrap-around whenever
   sequence numbers of subsequent packets are not immediately adjacent.
   This problem occurs when packets are delayed, reordered, or lost in
   the network.

   As a consequence, RTT sampling has to be paused during times of loss.
   This however aggravates the problem, since the sender now requires
   new feedback from the receiver, but the receiver is unable to provide
   accurate and up-to-date information: the receiver is unable to sample
   the RTT, accordingly also not able to estimate X_recv correctly,



Renker & Fairhurst      Expires February 16, 2011               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     Sender RTT Estimate Option for DCCP       August 2010


   which then in turn affects X_Bps at the sender.

   The third limitation arises from using inter-arrival times as
   representatives of network inter-packet gaps.  It is well known that
   the inter-packet gap is not constant along a network path.
   Furthermore, modern network interface cards do not necessarily
   deliver each packet at the time it is received, but rather in a
   bunch, to avoid overly frequent interrupts [MR97].  As a result,
   inter-packet arrival times may converge to zero, when subsequent
   packets are delivered at virtually the same time, served by the same
   interrupt routine.

   The fourth problem is that of under-sampling and thus related to the
   first limitation.  If loss occurs while the receiver has not yet had
   a chance to sample the RTT, it needs to fall back to some fixed RTT
   constant to plug into the equation of [RFC5348], 6.3.1.  (The sender,
   for example, uses a fixed value of 1 second when it can not obtain an
   initial RTT sample, compare [RFC5348], 4.2).

   In particular, if the loss is caused by a transient condition, this
   fourth problem causes a subsequent deterioration of the connection
   (rate reduction), further aggravated by the fact that TFRC takes
   longer than common window-based protocols to recover from a reduction
   of its allowed sending rate.

   The fifth and last problem is starvation under burst loss, caused for
   instance by a sudden interference in a wireless transmission.  The
   resulting burst loss sets off a vicious circle, where link-layer
   retransmissions and transmitter-backoff procedures and/or reverse-
   path loss eventually cause the nofeedback timer to be triggered at
   the sender.  This in turn halves the sending rate, thereby doubling
   the inter-packet gap.  Which in turn decreases X_recv sampled via RTT
   at the receiver.  These factors contribute to an accelerated
   reduction of the sending rate towards zero, or rather 1 packet per 64
   seconds (t_mbi).  Under these conditions the connection is no longer
   in a usable state, unless buffering of more than 64 seconds (more is
   required because the sending rate is low) can be applied, which is
   impossible for interactive applications, and unacceptable for many
   audio/video applications.

   Trying to smooth over these effects by imposing heavy filtering on
   the RTT samples did not substantially improve the situation, nor does
   it solve the problem of under-sampling.

   We are not aware of an alternative (published) algorithm to better
   estimate the RTT at the receiver.

   The TFRC sender, on the other hand, is much better equipped to



Renker & Fairhurst      Expires February 16, 2011               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Sender RTT Estimate Option for DCCP       August 2010


   estimate the RTT and can do this more accurately.  This is in
   particular due to the use of timestamps and elapsed time information
   ([RFC5348], 3.2.2), which are mandatory in CCID-3 (sections 6 and 8.2
   of [RFC4342]).

2.2.  Other areas affected by the RTT sampling problems

   We here analyse the impact that unreliability of receiver-based RTT
   sampling has on the areas listed at the begin of this section.

   In addition, benefits of sender-based RTT sampling have already been
   pointed out in [RFC5348], and in the specification of CCID-3
   [RFC4342], at the end of section 10.2.

2.2.1.  Measured Receive Rate X_recv

   A key problem is that the reliability of X_recv [RFC4342] depends
   directly upon the reliability and accuracy of RTT samples.  This
   means that failures propagate from one parameter to another.

   Errata IDs 610 and 611 update [RFC4342] to use the definition of the
   receive rate as specified in [RFC5348].

   Having an explicit (rather than a coarse-grained) RTT estimate allows
   measurement of X_recv with greater accuracy, and isolates failure.

   An explicit RTT estimate also enables the receiver to more accurately
   perform the test in step (2) of [RFC4342], 6.2, i.e. to check whether
   less or more than one RTT has passed since the last feedback.

2.2.2.  Disambiguation and Accuracy of Loss Intervals

   Since a loss event is defined as one or more lost (ECN-marked) data
   packets in one RTT ([RFC5348], 5.2), the receiver needs accurate RTT
   estimates to validate and accurately separate loss events.  Moreover,
   [RFC5348], 5.2 expressly points out the sender RTT estimate as
   RECOMMENDED for this purpose.

   Having the sender RTT Estimate available further increases the
   accuracy of the information reported by the receiver.  The definition
   of Loss Intervals in [RFC4342], 6.1 needs the RTT to separate the
   lossy parts; in particular, lossy parts spanning a period of more
   than one RTT are invalid.

   A similar benefit arises in the computation of the loss event rate:
   as discussed in section 9.2 of [RFC4342], it may happen that sender
   and receiver compute different loss event rates, due to differences
   in the available timing information.  An explicit RTT estimate



Renker & Fairhurst      Expires February 16, 2011               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Sender RTT Estimate Option for DCCP       August 2010


   increases the accuracy of information available at the receiver, thus
   the sender may not need to recompute the (less reliable) loss event
   rate reported by the receiver.

2.2.3.  Determining Quiescence

   The quiescence period is defined as max(2 * RTT, 0.2 sec) in section
   6.4 of [RFC4342].  An explicit RTT estimate avoids under- and over-
   estimating quiescence periods.

2.2.4.  Practical Considerations

   Using explicit RTT estimates contributes to greater robustness and
   can also result in simpler implementation:

   First, it becomes easier to separate adjacent loss events.  The 4-bit
   counter value wraps relatively frequently, which requires complex
   computations to avoid aliasing effects.

   Second, the receiver is better able to determine when to send
   feedback packets.  It can perform the test described in step (2) of
   [RFC5348], 6.2 more accurately.  Moreover, unnecessary expiration of
   the nofeedback timer (as described in [RFC4342], 10.3) can be
   avoided.

   Lastly, a sender-based RTT estimate option can be used by middleboxes
   for verification [RFC4342], 10.2.

3.  Specification

3.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses the conventions of [RFC5348], [RFC4340],
   [RFC4342], and [RFC5622].

3.2.  Options and Features

   This document defines a single TFRC-specific option, RTT Estimate,
   described in the next subsection.

   Following the guidelines in [RFC4340], section 15, the use of the RTT
   Estimate option is governed by an associated feature, Send RTT
   Estimate.  This feature is described in the second subsection.

3.2.1.  RTT Estimate Option

   The sender communicates its current RTT estimate to the receiver
   using a RTT Estimate option.

         Table 1: The RTT Estimate option defined by this document

   Column meanings are as per [RFC4340], section 5.8 (table 3).  This
   option is permitted in any DCCP packet, has option number XX and a
   length of 6 bytes.

   The four bytes of option data carry the current RTT estimate of the
   sender, using a granularity of 1 microsecond (senders sampling with a
   lower resolution can multiply their RTT estimates to achieve this
   granularity).

   A value of zero indicates that the sender does not have a valid RTT
   sample yet.

   Senders SHOULD send long-term RTT estimates (sampled over a longer
   period of time) rather than instantaneous RTT samples.

3.2.2.  Send RTT Estimate Feature

   The Send RTT Estimate feature lets endpoints negotiate whether the
   sender MUST provide RTT Estimate options on its data packets.

    +--------+-------------------+------------+---------------+-------+

      Table 2: The Send RTT Estimate feature defined by this document

   The column meanings are described in [RFC4340], section 6.4.  In
   particular, the feature is by default off (initial value of 0), and
   the extension is not required to be understood by every DCCP
   implementation (cf. [RFC4340], section 15).

   DCCP B sends a "Change R(Send RTT Estimate, 1)" to ask DCCP A to send
   RTT Estimate options as part of its data traffic.

3.3.  Usage

   When the Send RTT Estimate Feature is enabled, the sender MUST
   provide an RTT Estimate Option on all of its Data, DataAck, Sync, and
   SyncAck packets.  It MAY in addition provide the RTT Estimate Option
   on other packet types, such as DCCP-Ack.

   When the receiver has requested the use of the RTT Estimate Option,
   it MUST use the RTT value reported by that option in all places that
   require a RTT (listed at the begin of Section 2), and MUST NOT
   estimate the RTT based on CCVal window counter values.  The receiver
   MAY keep a moving-average of these sender-based RTT estimates, in the
   manner of [RFC5348], section 4.3.

   When the Send RTT Estimate is disabled, the sender MUST NOT send RTT
   Estimate options on any of its packets, the receiver MUST ignore the
   RTT Estimate option on all incoming packets, and MUST try to estimate
   the RTT in some other way (not specified by this document).

   The sender MUST implement and continue to update CCVal window counter
   RTT values as specified in [RFC4342], section 8.1, even when the Send
   RTT Estimate Feature is on.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for CCID-3 have been discussed in section 11
   of [RFC4342]; for CCID-4 these have been discussed in section 13 of
   [RFC5622], referring back to the same section of [RFC4342].

   This document introduces an extension to communicate the current RTT
   estimate of the sender to the receiver of a TFRC communication.

   By altering the value of the RTT Estimate option, it is possible to
   interfere with the behaviour of the flow.  In particular, since
   accuracy of the RTT estimate directly influences the accuracy of the
   measured sending rate X_recv, it would be possible to obtain either
   higher or lower sending rates than are warranted by the current
   network conditions.

   This is only possible if an attacker is on the same path as the DCCP
   sender and receiver, and is able to guess valid sequence numbers.
   Therefore the considerations in section 18 of [RFC4340] apply.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   This document is a rewrite of Revision 00.  The wording has changed,
   and as a result of more experience with CCID-3/4, the list of
   problems has been added to.  The specification itself remains
   unchanged from Revision 00.
