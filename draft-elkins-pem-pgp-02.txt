Abstract

     This document describes how Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) can be used to
     provide privacy and authentication using the Multipurpose Internet
     Mail Extensions (MIME) security content types described in RFC1847.

1.  Introduction

     Previous work on integrating PGP with MIME (including the since
     withdrawn application/pgp content type) has suffered from a number
     of problems, the most significant of which is the inability to
     recover signed message bodies without parsing data structures
     specific to PGP.  This work makes use of the elegant solution
     proposed in RFC1847, which defines security multipart formats for
     MIME. The security multiparts clearly separate the signed message
     body from the signature, and have a number of other desirable
     properties. This document is styled after RFC 1848, which defines
     MIME Object Security Services (MOSS) for providing security and
     authentication.

     This document defines three new content types for implementing
     security and privacy with PGP: application/pgp-encrypted,
     application/pgp-signature and application/pgp-keys.

2.  PGP data formats

     PGP can generate either ascii armor (described in [3]) or 8 bit
     binary output when encrypting data, generating a digital signature,
     or extracting public key data.  The ascii armor output is the
     REQUIRED method for data transfer.  This allows those users who do
     not have the means to interpret the formats described in this
     document to be able extract and use the PGP information in the
     message.

     When the amount of data to be transmitted requires that it be sent
     in many parts, the MIME message/partial mechanism should be used
     rather than the multipart ascii armor PGP format.

3.  Content-Transfer-Encoding restrictions

     Multipart/signed and multipart/encrypted are to be treated by agents
     as opaque, meaning that the data is not to be altered in any way
     [1].  However, many existing mail gateways will detect if the next
     hop does not support MIME or 8-bit data and perform conversion to
     either Quoted-Printable or Base64.  This presents serious problems
     for multipart/signed, in particular, where the signature is
     invalidated when such an operation occurs.  For this reason it is
     necessary to REQUIRE that ALL data encrypted OR signed according to
     this protocol be constrained to 7-bits (8-bit data should be encoded
     using either Quoted-Printable or Base64).  This restriction will
     increase the likelihood that the signature will be valid upon
     receipt.

4.  PGP encrypted data

     Before encryption with PGP, the data should be written in MIME
     canonical format (body and headers).

     PGP encrypted data is denoted by the "multipart/encrypted" content
     type, described in [1], and REQUIRES a "protocol" parameter value of
     "application/pgp-encrypted".  Note that the value of the parameter
     MUST be enclosed in quotes.

     The multipart/encrypted MUST consist of exactly two parts.  The
     first MIME body part must have a content type of "application/pgp-
     encrypted".  The data portion of the body may be zero length or
     contain human readable information about the encrypted data.

     The second MIME body part MUST contain the actual encrypted data.
     It must be labeled with a content type of "application/octet-
     stream".

          --foo

          --foo--

5.  PGP signed data

     PGP signed messages are denoted by the "multipart/signed" content
     type, described in [1], and REQUIRE the "protocol" parameter to have
     a value of "application/pgp-signature" (MUST be quoted), and the
     "micalg" parameter to have a value of "pgp-md5".

     The multipart/signed body MUST consist of exactly two parts.  The
     first part contains the signed data in MIME canonical format,
     including a set of appropriate content headers describing the data.

     The second body MUST contain the PGP digital signature.  It MUST be
     labeled with a content type of "application/pgp-signature".

     When the PGP digital signature is generated:

     (1)  Each line of data MUST NOT contain any trailing whitespace, and
          MUST end with a <CR><LF> sequence.  When it is necessary to
          preserve trailing whitespace, quoted-printable encoding of data
          is recommended (the last whitespace octet will be encoded, thus
          assuring compliance with this rule).

     (2)  As described in [1], the digital signature MUST be calculated
          over both the data to be signed and its set of content headers.

     (3)  The signature MUST be generated detached from the signed data
          so that the process does not alter the signed data in any way.

     Example message:

            From: Michael Elkins <elkins@aero.org>
            To: Michael Elkins <elkins@aero.org>

     The "&"s in the previous example indicate the portion of the data
     over which the signature was calculated.

     Upon receipt of a signed message, trailing whitespace in lines MUST
     be removed.  It is assumed to be added during transmission since

     this protocol does not allow for it.

     Though not required, it is generally a good idea to use Quoted-
     Printable encoding in the first step (writing out the data to be
     signed in MIME canonical format) if any of the lines in the data
     begin with "From ", and encode the "F".  This will avoid an MTA
     inserting a ">" in front of the line, thus invalidating the
     signature!

6.  Encrypted and Signed Data

     Sometimes it is desirable to to both digitally sign and then encrypt
     a message to be sent.  This protocol allows for two methods of
     accomplishing this task.

6.1  RFC1847 Encapsulation

     In [1], it is stated that the data should first be signed as a
     multipart/signature body, and then encrypted to form the final
     multipart/encrypted body, i.e.,

          Content-Type: multipart/encrypted;
              protocol="application/pgp-encrypted"; boundary=foo

          --foo
          Content-Type: application/pgp-encrypted


          --foo
          Content-Type: application/octet-stream

          -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
               & Content-Type: multipart/signed; micalg=pgp-md5
               &     protocol="application/pgp-signature"; boundary=bar
               &
               & --bar
               & Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
               &
               & This message was first signed, and then encrypted.
               &
               & --bar
               & Content-Type: application/pgp-signature
               &
               & -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
               & ...
               & -----END PGP MESSAGE-----
               &
               & --bar--

          -----END PGP MESSAGE-----

          --foo--

          (The text preceded by '&' indicates that it is really
          encrypted, but presented as text for clarity.)

6.2  Combined method

     Versions 2.x of PGP also allow data to be signed and encrypted in
     one operation.  This method is an acceptable shortcut, and has the
     benefit of less overhead.  The resulting data should be formed as a
     "multipart/encrypted" object as described above.

     Messages which are encrypted and signed in this combined fashion are
     REQUIRED to follow the same canonicalization rules as for
     multipart/signed objects (lines contain no trailing whitespace and
     end with <CR><LF>).

     It is explicitly allowed for an agent to decrypt a combined message
     and rewrite it as a multipart/signed object using the signature data
     embedded in the encrypted version.

7.  Distribution of PGP public keys

     Content-Type: application/pgp-keys
     Required parameters: none
     Optional parameters: none

     This is the content type which should be used for relaying public
     key blocks.
