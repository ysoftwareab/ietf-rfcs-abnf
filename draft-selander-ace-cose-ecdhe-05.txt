               Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC)
                  draft-selander-ace-cose-ecdhe-05

Abstract

   This document specifies Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC), a
   compact, and lightweight authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange
   with ephemeral keys that can be used over any layer.  EDHOC messages
   are encoded with CBOR and COSE, allowing reuse of existing libraries.

1.  Introduction

   Security at the application layer provides an attractive option for
   protecting Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, for example where
   transport layer security is not sufficient
   [I-D.hartke-core-e2e-security-reqs].  IoT devices may be constrained
   in various ways, including memory, storage, processing capacity, and
   energy [RFC7228].  A method for protecting individual messages at the
   application layer suitable for constrained devices, is provided by
   CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [I-D.ietf-cose-msg]), which
   builds on the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC7049].

   In order for a communication session to provide forward secrecy, the
   communicating parties can run a Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)
   key exchange protocol with ephemeral keys, from which shared key

   material can be derived.  This document specifies Ephemeral Diffie-
   Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC), an authenticated ECDH protocol using CBOR
   and COSE objects.  Authentication is based on credentials established
   out of band, e.g. from a trusted third party, such as an
   Authorization Server as specified by [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].
   EDHOC supports authentication using pre-shared keys (PSK), raw public
   keys (RPK), and certificates (Cert).  Note that this document focuses
   on authentication and key establishment: for integration with
   authorization of resource access, refer to
   [I-D.seitz-ace-oscoap-profile].  This document also specifies the
   derivation of shared key material.

   The ECDH exchange and the key derivation follow [SIGMA], NIST SP-
   800-56a [SP-800-56a], and HKDF [RFC5869].  CBOR [RFC7049] and COSE
   [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] are used to implement these standards.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document use the same informational CBOR Data Definition
   Language (CDDL) [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl] grammar as COSE
   (see Section 1.3 of [I-D.ietf-cose-msg]).  A vertical bar | denotes
   byte string concatenation.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  These
   words may also appear in this document in lowercase, absent their
   normative meanings.

2.  Protocol Overview

   SIGMA (SIGn-and-MAc) is a family of theoretical protocols with a
   large number of variants [SIGMA].  Like IKEv2 and TLS 1.3, EDHOC is
   built on a variant of the SIGMA protocol which provide identity
   protection, and like TLS 1.3, EDHOC implements the SIGMA-I variant as
   Sign-then-MAC.  The SIGMA-I protocol using an AEAD algorithm is shown
   in Figure 1.

              Figure 1: AEAD variant of the SIGMA-I protocol

   The parties exchanging messages are called "U" and "V".  They
   exchange identities and ephemeral public keys, compute the shared
   secret, and derive the keying material.  The messages are signed,
   MACed, and encrypted.

   o  E_U and E_V are the ECDH ephemeral public keys of U and V,
      respectively.

   o  ID_U and ID_V are identifiers for the public keys of U and V,
      respectively.

   o  Sig(U; . ) and S(V; . ) denote signatures made with the private
      key of U and V, respectively.

   o  Enc(K; P; A) denotes AEAD encryption of plaintext P and additional
      authenticated data A using the key K derived from the shared
      secret.  The AEAD MUST NOT be replaced by plain encryption, see
      Section 8.

   As described in Appendix B of [SIGMA], in order to create a "full-
   fledge" protocol some additional protocol elements are needed.  EDHOC
   adds:

   o  Explicit session identifiers S_U, S_V chosen by U and V,
      respectively.

   o  Explicit nonces N_U, N_V chosen freshly and anew with each session
      by U and V, respectively.

   o  Computationally independent keys derived from the ECDH shared
      secret and used for encryption of different messages.

   EDHOC also makes the following additions:

   o  Negotiation of key derivation, encryption, and signature
      algorithms:

      *  U proposes one or more algorithms of the following kinds:

         +  HKDF

         +  AEAD

         +  Signature verification

         +  Signature generation

      *  V selects one algorithm of each kind

   o  Transmission of application defined extensions.

   EDHOC is designed to encrypt and integrity protect as much
   information as possible, and all symmetric keys are derived using as
   much previous information as possible.  EDHOC is furthermore designed
   to be as compact and lightweight as possible, in terms of message
   sizes, processing, and the ability to reuse already existing CBOR and
   COSE libraries.  EDHOC does not put any requirement on the lower
   layers and can therefore be also be used e.g. in environments without
   IP.

   This paper is organized as follows: Section 3 specifies general
   properties of EDHOC, including formatting of the ephemeral public
   keys and key derivation, Section 4 specifies EDHOC with asymmetric
   key authentication, Section 5 specifies EDHOC with symmetric key
   authentication, and Appendix A provides a wealth of test vectors to
   ease implementation and ensure interoperability.

3.  EDHOC Overview

   EDHOC consists of three messages (message_1, message_2, message_3)
   that maps directly to the three messages in SIGMA-I.  All EDHOC
   messages consists of a CBOR array where the first element is an int
   specifying the message type (MSG_TYPE).  After creating EDHOC
   message_3, Party U can derive the traffic key (master secret) and
   protected application data can therefore be sent in parallel with
   EDHOC message_3.  The application data may e.g. be protected using
   the negotiated AEAD algorithm.  EDHOC may be used with the media type
   application/edhoc defined in Section 7.

                       Figure 2: EDHOC message flow

   The EDHOC message exchange may be authenticated using pre-shared keys
   (PSK), raw public keys (RPK), or certificates (Cert).  EDHOC assumes
   the existence of mechanisms (certification authority, manual
   distribution, etc.) for binding identities with authentication keys
   (public or pre-shared).  EDHOC with symmetric key authentication is
   very similar to EDHOC with asymmetric key authentication, the
   differences are that information is only MACed (not signed) and that
   EDHOC with symmetric key authentication offers encryption, integrity
   protection, and key proof-of-possession already in message_1.

   EDHOC allows application defined extensions (EXT_1, EXT_2, EXT_3) to
   be sent in the respective messages.  When EDHOC are used with
   asymmetric key authentication, EXT_1 is unprotected, EXT_2 is
   protected (encrypted and integrity protected), but sent to an
   unauthenticated party, and EXT_3 is protected and mutually
   authenticated.  When EDHOC is used with symmetric key authentication,
   all extensions are protected and mutually authenticated.

3.1.  Formatting of the Ephemeral Public Keys

   The ECDH ephemeral public key SHALL be formatted as a COSE_Key of
   type EC2 or OKP according to section 13.1 and 13.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-cose-msg].  The curve X25519 is mandatory to implement.
   For Elliptic Curve Keys of type EC2, point compression is mandatory
   to implement.

3.2.  Key Derivation

   Key and IV derivation SHALL be done as specified in Section 11.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-cose-msg] with the following input:

   o  The PRF SHALL be the HKDF [RFC5869] in the ECDH-SS w/ HKDF
      negotiated during the message exchange (HKDF_V).





Selander, et al.       Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC)     March 2017


   o  The secret SHALL be the ECDH shared secret as defined in
      Section 12.4.1 of [I-D.ietf-cose-msg].

   o  salt = PSK / nil

   o  The context information SHALL be the serialized COSE_KDF_Context
      with the following values:

      *  PartyInfo = ( nil, nil, nil )

      *  SuppPubInfo SHALL contain:

         +  protected SHALL be a zero length bstr

       +  other = aad_1  / aad_2  / aad_3 /
                  H( H( H(message_1) | message_2 ) | message_3 ) | label

   The salt SHALL only be present in the symmetric case.

   The symmetric key and IV used to protect message_i is called K_i and
   IV_i, and are derived using byte string aad_i defined for each EDHOC
   message i = 1, 2 or 3 that make use of a symmetric key.

   K_1 and IV_1 are only used in EDHOC with symmetric key authentication
   and are derived with the exceptions that secret SHALL be empty and
   the PRF SHALL be HKDF-256 (or a HKDF decided by the application).

   All other keys are derived with the negotiated PRF and with the
   secret set to the ECDH shared secret.

   Application specific traffic keys and key identifiers are derived
   using the byte string H( H( H(message_1) | message_2 ) | message_3
   ) | label, where H() is the hash function in HKDF_V, label is a byte
   string, and | denotes byte string concatenation.  Each application
   making use of EDHOC defines its own labels and how they are used.

4.  EDHOC Authenticated with Asymmetric Keys

4.1.  Overview

   EDHOC supports authentication with raw public keys (RPK) and
   certificates (Cert) with the requirements that:

   o  Party U's SHALL be able to uniquely identify Party V's public key
      using ID_V.

   o  Party V's SHALL be able to uniquely identify Party U's public key
      using ID_U.

Internet-Draft Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC)     March 2017


   ID_U and ID_V either enable the other party to retrieve the public
   key (kid, x5t, x5u) or they contain the public key (x5c), see
   [I-D.schaad-cose-x509].  Party U and party V MAY use different type
   of credentials, e.g. one uses RPK and the other Cert.  Party U and
   party V MAY use different signature algorithms.

   EDHOC with asymmetric key authentication is illustrated in Figure 3.

5.  EDHOC Authenticated with Symmetric Keys

5.1.  Overview

   EDHOC supports authentication with pre-shared keys.  Party U and V
   are assumed to have a pre-shared uniformly random key (PSK) with the
   requirement that:

   o  Party V SHALL be able to uniquely identify the PSK using KID.

   KID either enable the other party to retrieve the PSK or contain the
   PSK (e.g.  CBOR Web Token).

   EDHOC with symmetric key authentication is illustrated in Figure 4.

8.  Security Considerations

   EDHOC builds on the SIGMA-I family of theoretical protocols that
   provides perfect forward secrecy and identity protection with a
   minimal number of messages.  The encryption algorithm of the SIGMA-I
   protocol provides identity protection, but the security of the
   protocol requires the MAC to cover the identity of the signer.  Hence
   the message authenticating functionality of the authenticated
   encryption in EDHOC is critical: authenticated encryption MUST NOT be



Selander, et al.       Expires September 14, 2017              [Page 21]

Internet-Draft Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC)     March 2017


   replaced by plain encryption only, even if authentication is provided
   at another level or through a different mechanism.

   EDHOC adds an explicit message type and expands the authentication
   coverage to additional elements such as algorithms, extensions, and
   previous messages.  EDHOC uses the same Sign-then-MAC approach as TLS
   1.3.

   Party U and V must make sure that unprotected data and metadata do
   not reveal any sensitive information.  This also applies for
   encrypted data sent to an unauthenticated party.  In particular, it
   applies to EXT_1 and EXT_2 in the asymmetrical case, and KID in the
   symmetrical case.  The communicating parties may therefore anonymize
   KID.

   Using the same KID or unprotected extension in several EDHOC sessions
   allows passive eavesdroppers to correlate the different sessions.
   Another consideration is that the list of supported algorithms may be
   used to identify the application.

   Party U and V must make sure that unprotected data does not trigger
   any harmful actions.  In particular, this applies to EXT_1 in the
   asymmetrical case, and KID in the symmetrical case.  Party V should
   be aware that replays of EDHOC message_1 cannot be detected unless
   unless previous nonces are stored.

   The availability of a secure pseudorandom number generator and truly
   random seeds are essential for the security of EDHOC.  If no true
   random number generator is available, a truly random seed must be
   provided from an external source.  If ECDSA is supported,
   "deterministic ECDSA" as specified in RFC6979 is RECOMMENDED.

   Nonces MUST NOT be reused, both parties MUST generate fresh random
   nonces.  Ephemeral keys SHOULD NOT be reused, both parties SHOULD
   generate fresh random ephemeral key pairs.

   The referenced processing instructions in [SP-800-56a] must be
   complied with, including deleting the intermediate computed values
   along with any ephemeral ECDH secrets after the key derivation is
   completed.

   Party U and V are responsible for verifying the integrity of
   certificates.  The selection of trusted CAs should be done very
   carefully and certificate revocation should be supported.

   The choice of key length used in the different algorithms needs to be
   harmonized, so that a sufficient security level is maintained for

Internet-Draft Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over COSE (EDHOC)     March 2017


   certificates, EDHOC, and the protection of application data.  Party U
   and V should enforce a minimum security level.

   Note that, depending on the application, the keys established through
   the EDHOC protocol will need to be renewed, in which case the
   communicating parties need to run the protocol again.

   Implementations should provide countermeasures to side-channel
   attacks such as timing attacks.

Appendix B.  EDHOC with CoAP and OSCOAP

B.1.  Transferring EDHOC in CoAP

   EDHOC can be transferred as an exchange of CoAP [RFC7252] messages,
   with the CoAP client as party U and the CoAP server as party V.  By
   default EDHOC is sent to the Uri-Path: "edhoc".

              Client    Server
                |          |
                +--------->| Header: POST (Code=0.02)
                |   POST   | Uri-Path: "edhoc"
                |          | Content-Type: application/edhoc
                |          | Payload: EDHOC message_1
                |          |
                |<---------+ Header: 2.04 Changed
                |   2.04   | Content-Type: application/edhoc
                |          | Payload: EDHOC message_2
                |          |
                +--------->| Header: POST (Code=0.02)
                |   POST   | Uri-Path: "edhoc"
                |          | Content-Type: application/edhoc
                |          | Payload: EDHOC message_3
                |          |
                |<---------+ Header: 2.04 Changed
                |   2.04   |
                |          |

B.2.  Deriving an OSCOAP context from EDHOC

   When EDHOC is use to derive parameters for OSCOAP
   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security], the parties must make sure that the
   EDHOC session identifiers are unique Recipient IDs in OSCOAP.  In
   case that the CoAP client is party U and the CoAP server is party V:

   o  The AEAD Algorithm is AEAD_V, as defined in this document

   o  The KDF algorithm is HKDF_V, as defined in this document

   o  The Client's Sender ID is S_V, as defined in this document

   o  The Server's Sender ID is S_U, as defined in this document

   o  The Master Secret is derived as specified in Section 3.2 of this
      document, with label = "OSCOAP Master Secret".  The length is
      equal to the key length of AEAD_V.

   o  The Master Salt is derived as specified in Section 3.2 of this
      document, with label = "OSCOAP Master Salt".  The length is 64
      bits.
