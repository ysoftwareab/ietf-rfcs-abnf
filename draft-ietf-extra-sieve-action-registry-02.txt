1.  Introduction

   Sieve Email Filtering Language [RFC5228] is a popular email filtering
   language used upon final mail delivery.  Popularity of Sieve resulted
   in a myriad of Sieve extensions that can interact with each other in
   wonderful and complex ways.  There is currently no easy way to find
   out all actions defined by Sieve extensions published in RFCs, which
   make it quite difficult for Sieve extension writers and Sieve
   implementation developers to forsee interactions between Sieve
   actions.

   This document creates a registry of Sieve [RFC5228] actions in order
   to help developers and Sieve extension writers track interactions
   between different extensions.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  Sieve Actions Registration Template and Procedure

   IANA is requested to create a new registry for Sieve actions (see
   Section 2.9 of [RFC5228] for details on Sieve actions).  Registration
   of both actions specified in IETF Stream RFCs and vendor specific
   actions is allowed and encouraged.  The registration template
   contains:

   1.  name of the action;

   2.  short description;

   3.  references: one or more documents describing the action and any
       significant updates to its definition (this field is REQUIRED for
       actions described in RFCs and OPTIONAL otherwise);

   4.  name(s) of Sieve capabilit(ies) associated with the Sieve action
       being registered;

   5.  interactions with other Sieve actions, if any;

   6.  flag specifying whether the action cancels the implicit keep (see
       Section 2.10.2 of [RFC5228]);

   7.  whether or not this action can be used with IMAP events in Sieve
       ([RFC6785]), and

   8.  optional comment.

   Registration procedure for this registry is Expert Review.  The
   Designated Expert only checks that the name of the action being
   registered matches documentation, that the description field is
   accurate, that the correct documents are referenced and that the list
   of relevant documents is as complete as possible.  The Designated
   Expert can't reject a registration based on personal dislike of the
   document defining an action and should always err on the side of
   registering, even if documentation is not complete.

   Addition of a new reference to an existing registration or change to
   the description field goes through the same registration procedure as
   a new registration.

3.2.  Initial Sieve Action Registry

   The following table is used to initialize the actions registry.

4.  Security Considerations

   The sole purpose of this document is to create a new IANA registry,
   so it doesn't create new security considerations for Sieve
   implementations.

   The new registry should help Sieve extension writers and Sieve
   implementors track interactions between different Sieve actions, so
   it might improve quality of specifications and implementations,
   including security aspects.
