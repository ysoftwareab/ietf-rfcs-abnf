Internet-Draft                URI Template                  October 2006


1.  Introduction

   URI Templates are strings that contain embedded variables that are
   transformed into URIs after embedded variables are substituted.  This
   document defines the structure and syntax of URI Templates.

   URI Templates are useful when it's necessary to convey the structure
   of a URI in a well-defined way.  For example, documentation of an
   interface exposed by a Web site might use a template to show people
   how to find information about a user;

       http://www.example.com/users/{userid}

   URI Templates can also be thought of as the basis of a machine-
   readable forms language; by allowing clients to form their own
   identifiers based on templates given to them by the URI's authority,
   it's possible to construct dynamic systems that use more of the URI
   than traditional HTML forms are able to.  For example,

       http://www.example.org/products/{upc}/buyers?page={page_num}

   Finally, URI Templates can be used to compose URI-centric protocols
   without impinging on authorities' control of their URIs.  For
   example, there are many emerging conventions for passing around login
   information between sites using URIs.  Forcing people to use a well-
   known query parameter isn't good practice, but using a URI parameter
   allows different sites to specify local ways of conveying the same
   information;

       http://login.example.org/login?back={return-uri}
       http://auth.example.com/userauth;{return-uri}

   This specification defines the basic syntax and processing of URI
   Templates.  Each application of URI Templates will need to define its
   own profile of this specification that indicates what template
   variables are available, how to convey them to clients, and what
   their appropriate use is in that context.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC2234].  See [RFC3986] for reserved and unreserved
   productions.

Internet-Draft                URI Template                  October 2006


3.  Motivation

   URI Templates are useful in a number of scenarios including web
   service documentation and application code.  A standard syntax and
   well-defined substitution rules will improve interop.

4.  URI Template

   A URI Template is a sequence of characters that contains one or more
   embedded template variables Section 4.1.  A URI Template becomes a
   URI when the template variables are substituted with the template
   variables string values, see Section 4.2.  The following shows an
   example URI Template:

   http://example.com/widgets/{widget_id}

   If the value of the widget_id variable is "xyzzy", the resulting URI
   after substitution is:

   http://example.com/widgets/xyzzy


4.1  Template Variables

   Template variables are the parameterized components of a URI
   Template, their representation is described below.  A template
   variable MUST match the template-var production.

    template-char = unreserved
    template-name  = 1*template-char
    template-var  = "{" template-name "}"


4.2  URI Template Substitution

   Evaluating a URI Template consists of replacing each occurrence of a
   template variable with the string value of that variable.  Obtaining
   the string value of a template variable is an application-specific
   process, this specification places no constraints on the mechanism
   employed.  Template variables MAY appear in a URI Template any number
   of times.

   If the value of a template variable would conflict with a reserved
   character's purpose as a delimiter, then the conflicting data must be
   percent-encoded before substitution.  That is, merely doing rote
   substitution on template variables could result in the generation of
   an invalid URI for a particular scheme.  Specifications that use URI
   Templates are expected to take this into consideration in how they

Internet-Draft                URI Template                  October 2006


   use such templates.

   When the values of any template variables have been substituted into
   a URI template, the resulting string MUST match the URI-reference
   production of RFC 3986 and MUST also match the productions for the
   scheme in the final URI.

   This specification presumes that the value of a template variable
   does not contain characters outside the allowed set for the
   component(s) of the URI that it parameterizes.

4.3  Examples

   Given the following template names and values

       Name                                Value
       ------------------------------------------------------------
       a                                   fred
       b                                   barney
       c                                   cheeseburger
       20                                  this-is-spinal-tap
       a~b                                 none%20of%20the%20above
       schema                              https
       p                                   quote=to+bo+or+not+to+be
       e
       q                                   hullo#world

   Note that the name 'wilma' has not been defined, and the value of 'e'
   is the empty string.

   The following URI Templates will be expanded as shown:

       http://example.org/{a}{b}/
       http://example.org/fredbarney/

       http://example.org/page1#{a}
       http://example.org/page1#fred

       {scheme}://{20}.example.org?date={wilma}&option={a}
       https://this-is-spinal-tap.example.org?date=&option=fred

       http://example.org/{a~b}
       http://example.org/none%20of%20the%20above

       http://example.org?{p}
       http://example.org?quote=to+bo+or+not+to+be

       http://example.com/order/{c}/{c}/{c}/
       http://example.com/order/cheeseburger/cheeseburger/cheeseburger/

       http://example.com/{q}
       http://example.com/hullo#world

       http://example.com/{e}/
       http://example.com//

   The following are examples of URI Template expansions that are not
   legal.

       Name                                Value
       ------------------------------------------------------------
       a                                   fred barney
       b                                   %

   The following URI Templates are expanded with the given values and do
   not produce legal URIs.

       http://example.org/{a}
       http://example.org/fred barney

       http://example.org/{b}/
       http://example.org/%/


5.  Security Considerations

   A URI Template does not contain active or executable content.  Other

Internet-Draft                URI Template                  October 2006


   security considerations are the same as those for URIs, see section 7
   of RFC3986.

6.  IANA Considerations

   In common with RFC3986, URI scheme names form a registered namespace
   that is managed by IANA according to the procedures defined in
   [RFC2717].  No IANA actions are required by this document.
