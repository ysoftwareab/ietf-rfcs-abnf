       Abstract

       This document describes the motivation for investigating the
       definition and architectural implications of defining what a
       “context” is for mobility management purposes.  This draft seeks
       to generate enough interest on this topic in the working group. 
       If there is sufficient interest on this topic, drafts that 
       address methodologies to enable context aware mobility could be 
       proposed.

    1. Introduction

   There are experimental standards protocols such as the Context
   Transfer protocol [1] and the Candidate Access Router protocol [2]
   which facilitates seamless IP-layer handovers from one Access Router
   to another by providing routing related information in selecting a
   new point of attachment. Further, the emerging standard IEEE 802.21
   [3] specifies procedures that facilitate handover decision making,
   providing link layer state information and command procedures that
   could potentially support seamless service across heterogeneous
   access networks. It also defines methods and semantics that support
   the acquisition of access network information. Although such methods
   of acquiring context have been specified, up to now the use of
   “context” in mobility protocols to enhance the performance has been

   very limited. Further, the scope of context used within these
   protocols has been limited mostly to information about the New Access
   Routers to which a Mobile Node could potentially connect. In this
   draft we present some motivational factors to create interest within
   the WG to investigate context in a much broader sense and see how
   different contexts affects handover decisions and executions. Further
   we discuss some possible paths that can be investigated in enabling
   context aware mobility.

    2. Definition of “context” for mobility management purposes

   The mobility related terminology RFC [4] defines context as follows:

   Context: The information on the current state of a routing-related
   service required to re-establish the routing-related service on a new
   subnet without having to perform the entire protocol exchange with
   the MN from scratch.

   However, in order to support mobility in heterogeneous mobility
   environments in a lucrative manner we could use much more information
   pertaining to a situation and we should not limit our mobility
   management decisions to the use of context relating to only routing
   related states. Today’s technologies allow us to derive context from
   a variety of physical and logical sensors. We need to investigate
   what context information makes the most impact on mobility related
   decisions and redefine context for mobility management purposes. For
   example:

   Service context (what type of services are being used, i.e. what
   bandwidth and delay requirements exist)

   Security context (keys and authentication)

   Device context (capabilities of the MN)

   Mobility context (speed, HO rate, available candidate accesses)

   Flow control context (status of IP packets in the queues, e.g. for
   forwarding or for detection of transmission bottlenecks)

    3. Motivations to investigate architectural implications of
       “context” on mobility management

      3.1. Using context for mobility management decisions enhances
         performance

   The key objective of use of context for mobility management has been
   to reduce latency and packet losses to avoid the re-initiation of
   signaling to and from a Mobile Node.

      3.2. Load sharing

   Context information pertaining to the network such as network
   capacity would enable the use of the networks in a more economical
   manner.

      3.3. Enables functionalities according to a user’s expectation

   Context aware mobility management that takes into account user
   profiles/preferences  would  enable  connectivity  and  handovers
   according to user’s expectations.

    4. Possible areas to investigate on context aware mobility

      1)Should mobility management protocols incorporate context aware
        decision making? What is the most viable option?

      2)Should the architecture be such that a standard is available to
        cater to choose between different mobility protocols according
        to  the  context?  Should  such  an  architecture  take  into
        consideration only Mobile IP variants (MIPv4 [5], MIPv6 [6],
        FMIPv6 [7], HMIPv6 [8], PMIPv6 [9], DS-MIPv6 [10] ) or different
        protocols such as HIP [11], SIP [12] for context aware mobility
        management?

      3)Verify the impact of certain context cues on mobility management
        decisions (For example if the Mobile Node has access to
        information such as network load what would be the performance
        gain of having such context information)

      4)Is a cross layer mobility management protocol which takes into
        consideration  state  changes  at  each  layer  in  performing
        handovers a more viable option?

      5)Should a context aware mobility management protocol allow for
        arbitrary new sensor and information types to be introduced into
        the system at run-time?
