1. Abstract

    RFC1858 compliant filters can be vulnerable to a variant of the
    "Tiny Fragment Attack" described in section 3.1 of the RFC.  
    This document describes the attack and recommends corrective action.

2. Introduction

    RFC1858 provides an excellent description of a class of attack on
    Internet firewalls and proposes countermeasures.  However one of
    these countmeasures, the "Indirect Method" (section 3.2.2) is
    vulnerable to a combination of two of the attacks described.
    
    The attack combines the features of the "Tiny Fragment Attack"
    (section 3) and the "Overlapping Fragment Attack" (section 4).

2.1 The scope of the attack

    Where the filtering rules allow incoming connections to a machine
    AND there other ports which allow only outgoing connections on the
    same host, the attack allows incoming connections to the supposedly
    outgoing-only ports.

    Note that only the initial connection message need be fragmented.  
    Once the connection is established further traffic on it is legal.
    The significance of this weakness will depend on the security 
    policy in force.


3. The Tiny Overlapping Fragment Attack    

    The attack typically consists of sending three fragments.

    Fragment 1: (Fragment offset = 0; length >= 16)
        Includes whole header and is entirely legal.  Typically it 
        describes a SYN packet initiating a new TCP connection to a port
        on the target host that is allowed to receive incoming 
        connections.
        e.g. Incoming connection to port 25 SMTP.


    Fragment 2: (Fragment offset = 0; length = 8)
        Is only the first 8 bytes and could be legal depending on the 
        other 8-bytes of the header, but is NOT legal combined with the 
        corresponding bytes from Fragment 1.  Such a fragment includes
        only the port numbers and sequence number from the TCP header.
        Typically this packet replaces the destination port number with
        a port number on which the destination host that is not allowed 
        to receive incoming connections.
        

    Fragment 3:  (Fragment offset >= 2; length = rest of message)
        Contains no header and completes the message.  (This third 
        fragment is not part of the attack.  However Fragment 1 cannot 
        be the complete message or it would be passed up to the 
        application before Fragment 2 arrived so a third fragment is 
        necessary.)

3.1 Example of the attack

    Consider the following trival set of rules for incoming packets:

    +---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----------------------+
    | No|Action | Source| Dest. | Flags | Purpose               |
    |   |       | Port  | Port  |       |                       |
    +===+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======================+
    | 1 |Permit | >1023 | SMTP  |  ANY  | Incoming E-mail       |
    +---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----------------------+
    | 2 |Permit | >1023 |  ANY  |  Ack=1| Existing FTP data     |
    |   |               |       |       | channel connections.  |
    +---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----------------------+
    | 3 |Deny   | ANY   |  ANY  |  ANY  | Default deny          |
    +---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----------------------+

    Fragment 1: attacker(1234) -> target(SMTP) Ack=0 
        This is a new SMTP connection and is permitted by rule 1.
        
    Fragment 2: attacker(1234) -> target(Telnet=23) Ack=absent
        All fields present conform to rule 2, as it could be the 
        start of an FTP packet.

    Depending on the precise implementation of the fragment reassembly
    in the target machine's IP stack, fragment B may overwrite fragment
    A to produce:-
    attacker(1234) -> target(Telnet) Ack=0 
        (new telnet connection)

3.2 The failure of "Indirect Method"

    The Indirect Method attempts to solve both Tiny Fragment and 
    Overlapping Fragment attacks, solely by rejecting packets with FO=1.
    However none of the above fragments have FO=1, so none are rejected.

    The failure is clear on careful reading.  
    In section 3.2.2 "Indirect Method", RF1858 states:-

         The indirect method relies on the observation that when a TCP
         packet is fragmented so as to force "interesting" header fields
         out of the zero-offset fragment, there must exist a fragment
         with FO equal to 1.

    This is normally true where the fragments are genuine fragments, 
    generally by bona fide software, but it is simply not true that a 
    hacker forging fragments is forced to produce an FO=1 fragment 
    simply because (s)he has produced an 8-byte FO=0 fragment.  The
    vulnerability flows from this false premise.

4. Countermeasures

    Whereas apparently very elegant, RFC1858's Indirect Method is not 
    robust.  In addition to blocking FO=1 packets, it is also necessary
    to block FO=0 that hold less than a complete header.

         if FO=0 and PROTOCOL=TCP and TRANSPORTLEN < tmin then
                 DROP PACKET
         if FO=1 and PROTOCOL=TCP then
                 DROP PACKET

5. Security Considerations

   This memo is concerned entirely with the security implications of
   filtering fragmented IP packets.
