draft                   X.400 image body parts                  Nov 95


    1.  Introduction

    This document contains the body parts defined in RFC 1495 for
    carrying image formats that were originally defined in MIME
    through an X.400 system.

    This document is an Experimental standard; if it turns out to be
    useful and widely deployed, it can be moved onto the standards
    track.


    Editor's note
         It is trivially easy to define new OIDs for these things as
         FTAM body parts. This gives us a much more capable (AND
         complex) encapsulation. Group input into this decision is
         sought.

    2.  Newly defined X.400 body parts


    2.1.  The JPEG body part

    The following Extended Body Part is defined for JPEG data streams.
    It has no parameters.


       jpeg-body-part EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE
         DATA            OCTET STRING
         ::= mime-jpeg-body

       mime-jpeg-body OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
               { mixer-bp-data 3 }

    The content is as defined in [MIME].


    2.2.  The GIF body part

    The following Extended Body Part is defined for GIF data streams.
    It has no parameters.


       gif-body-part EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE
         DATA            OCTET STRING

draft                   X.400 image body parts                  Nov 95


         ::= mime-gif-body

       mime-gif-body OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
               { mixer-bp-data 4 }

    The content is as defined in [MIME].


    3.  Defined equivalences with MIME types


    3.1.  image/jpeg - jpeg-body-part

    X.400 Body Part: Extended Body Part, OID jpeg-body-part
    MIME Content-Type: image/jpeg
    Conversion: None



    3.2.  image/gif - gif-body-part

    X.400 Body Part: Extended Body Part, OID gif-body-part
    MIME Content-Type: image/gif
    Conversion: None



    4.  Security considerations

    Security issues are not consiered in this memo.
