Abstract

   This document specifies the updated format of the Nonce extension in
   Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) request and response
   messages.  OCSP is used to check the status of a certificate and the
   Nonce extension is used in the OCSP request and response messages to
   avoid replay attacks.  This document updates the RFC 6960

1.  Introduction

   This document updates the usage and format of the Nonce extension
   used in OCSP request and response messages.  This extension was
   previously defined in the section 4.1.1 of [RFC6960].  The [RFC6960]
   does not mention any minimum and maximum length of the nonce
   extension.  Due to not having an upper or lower limit of the length
   of the Nonce extension, the OCSP responders that follow [RFC6960] may
   be vulnerable to various attacks like Denial of Service attacks
   [RFC4732], chosen prefix attacks to get a desired signature from the
   OCSP responder and possible evasions that can use the Nonce extension
   data for evasion.  This document specifies a lower limit of 1 and
   upper limit of 32 to the length of the Nonce extension.  This
   document updates the [RFC6960].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  OCSP Extensions

   The message format for the OCSP request and response is defined in
   the [RFC6960].  It also defines the standard extensions for OCSP
   messages based on the extension model employed in X.509 version 3
   certificates (see [RFC5280]).  Following is the list of standard
   extensions that can be used in the OCSP messages by the OCSP
   responder and OCSP client.

      o  Nonce
      o  CRL References
      o  Acceptable Response Types
      o  Archive Cutoff
      o  CRL Entry Extensions
      o  Service Locator
      o  Preferred Signature Algorithms
      o  Extended Response Definition

   This document only specifies the new format for Nonce extension and
   does not change specification of any of the other standard
   extensions.

2.1.  Nonce Extension

   The nonce cryptographically binds a request and a response to prevent
   replay attacks.  The nonce is included as one of the
   requestExtensions in requests, while in responses it would be
   included as one of the responseExtensions.  In both the request and
   the response, the nonce will be identified by the object identifier
   id-pkix-ocsp-nonce, while the extnValue is the value of the nonce.
   If Nonce extension is present then the length of nonce MUST be
   atleast 1 octet and can be upto 32 octets.

   A server MUST reject any OCSP request having a Nonce extension with
   length of more than 32 octets with malformedRequest
   OCSPResponseStatus as described in section 4.2.1 of [RFC6960]

   The minimum nonce length of 1 octet is defined to provide the
   backward compatibility with clients following [RFC6960].  However the
   newer OCSP clients MUST use length of atleast 16 octets for Nonce
   extension and the value of the nonce MUST be generated using a
   cryptographically strong pseudorandom number generator.

      id-pkix-ocsp           OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ad-ocsp }

      id-pkix-ocsp-nonce     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix-ocsp 2 }

      Nonce ::= OCTET STRING(SIZE(1..32))

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of OCSP in general are described in the
   [RFC6960].  The Nonce extension is used to avoid replay attacks
   during the interval in which the previous OCSP response for a
   certificate is not expired but responder has a changed status for
   that certificate.  Including client's Nonce value in the OCSP

   response makes sure that the response is a latest response from the
   server and not an old copy.

3.1.  Replay Attack

   The Nonce extension is used to avoid replay attacks.  Since the OCSP
   responder may choose to not send the Nonce extension in the OCSP
   response even if the client has sent the Nonce extension in the
   request [RFC5019], a man in the middle (MITM) entity can intercept
   the OCSP request and respond with a earlier response from the server
   without the Nonce extension.  This can be mitigated by server using a
   closer nextUpdate value in the OCSP response.

3.2.  Nonce Collision

   If the value of the nonce used by a client is not random enough, then
   the attacker may pre fetch responses with the predicted nonce and can
   replay them, thus defeating the purpose of using nonce.  Therefore
   the client MUST use a nonce value that contains cryptographically
   strong randomness and is freshly generated.  Also if the length of
   the nonce is very small e.g. 1 octet then attacker can pre fetch
   responses with all the possible vaule of nonce and replay a matching
   nonce.  A client SHOULD use 32 octets for the nonce length.

4.  IANA Considerations

      This document does not include any new media type registrations
      for OCSP.
