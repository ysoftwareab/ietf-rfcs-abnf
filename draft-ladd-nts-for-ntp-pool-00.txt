Abstract

   Network Time Security authenticates NTP servers.  This document
   outlines an architecture that uses ACME and SRV records for the NTP
   pool to carry out NTS.

1.  Introduction

   NTP is commonly provided via an NTP pool: a collection of servers
   behind a DNS load balanced and/or geolocated domain name.  However
   Network Time Security requires certificates associated to the
   hostname of a server.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader may wish to note that one of the two RFC references in the
   preceding paragraph was normative; the other was informative.  These
   will be correctly identified as such in the References section below.

3.  Background

   The NTP pool uses dynamic DNS techniques to spread the load of NTP
   over a wide variety of servers.  Unfortunately this creates
   challenges to the deployment of NTS: the servers all appear to share
   the same hostname of the pool, and would all need certificates for
   that hostname.

   To avoid these problems this draft presents a technique using SRV
   records and per-server hostnames along with ACME.

4.  Clients

   A client interested in using NTS with nts-pool.ntp.example.org will
   look up the SRV records for NTS-KE at nts-pool.ntp.example.org.  This
   SRV record will point to Fully Qualified Domain names of the form
   servername.servers.pool.ntp.example.org, here called pool associated
   domain names.

   Clients will then execute NTS-KE against the resolved IP address for
   those names, and continue as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ntp-using-nts-for-ntp]

   Clients SHOULD obtain multiple servers from a pool lookup and treat
   them as independent sources.  If a source is unacceptable clients
   SHOULD replace them with new ones obtained from the pool.

   Clients MAY periodically resolve the pool associated domain names to
   confirm the server is still trusted by the pool.

5.  Pool Members

   Pool members will register their servers and provide a servername,
   e.g.  Alice.  They will then use ACME with the HTTP-01 or ALPN
   challenge to obtain a certificate for
   alice.servers.pool.ntp.example.org.

6.  Pool Operators

   On registration of a server pool operators will create
   servername.servers.pool.ntp.example.org pointing to the provided IP
   address(s).

   Once a certificate has been issued and NTS is confirmed operational,
   the pool may return SRV records pointing to the domain, either
   created by the pool or provided by the server operator.

   Pool operators who remove a server from the pool MUST break the pool
   associated domain name.  This prevents renewal of the associated
   certificate.

7.  Security Considerations

   This mechanism depends on the integrity of data in the DNS, for
   security and therefore DNSSEC should be used to protect the records.
   Webservers on server in the pool MUST check the Hosts header of
   incoming HTTP requests to prevent cookie theft.
