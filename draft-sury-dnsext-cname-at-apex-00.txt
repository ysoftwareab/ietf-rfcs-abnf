                         CNAME at the zone apex
                   draft-sury-dnsext-cname-at-apex-00

Abstract

   This document proposes a modification to CNAME record to coexist with
   SOA and NS records at the zone apex.  This proposal will improve
   aliasing in the DNS system.  The users are often forced to manually
   add duplicate A, AAAA and MX records by copying data from the target
   zone to the aliased zone.  This forces zone owner to keep track of
   target domain name since the mismatch in the data could cause
   failures.  This administrative burden will be eliminated by allowing
   CNAME to coexist with NS and SOA resource records.

Internet-Draft                 Apex-CNAME                    August 2010


1.  Introduction

   RFC 1033 [RFC1033] defines CNAME resource record for cases when there
   are multiple names for single host.  A CNAME resource record
   identifies its owner name as an alias, and specifies the
   corresponding canonical name in the RDATA section of the resource
   record.  If a CNAME resource record is present at a node, no other
   data MUST be present; this ensures that the data for a canonical name
   and its aliases cannot be different.  This rule also insures that a
   cached CNAME can be used without checking with an authoritative
   server for other resource record types.

   However there are already existing exceptions to this rule.  RFC 4034
   [RFC4034] defines exception to RRSIG and NSEC records, which MUST
   exist for the same name as a CNAME resource record in a signed zone.

   RFC 1034 [RFC1034] defines the data that defines the top node of the
   zone.  They are logically part of the authoritative data, the RRs
   that describe the top node of the zone are especially important to
   the zone's management.  These RRs are of two types: name server RRs
   that list, one per RR, all of the servers for the zone, and a single
   SOA RR that describes zone management parameters.

   The Start Of Authority (SOA) record designates the start of a zone.
   It must be present in the zone apex.

   The NS (Name Server) record lists the name of a machine the provides
   domain service for a particular zone.  The NS record is placed both
   in the parent and the child zone and should be same.  The NS
   record(s) are also mandatory in the zone.

1.1.  Terminology

   All the basic terms used in this specification are defined in the
   documents RFC 1033 [RFC1033], RFC 1034 [RFC1034].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Motivation

   The aliasing in the DNS system is usually done by placing CNAME for
   each individual record which needs to be aliased.  There is one
   notable exception - the zone apex which has to include the SOA and NS

   RRs.  Because of that the zone owner is unable to place CNAME record
   there and this can lead to several failure conditions.  Either the
   data in the apex is copied by hand and new administrative burden is
   created to keep the data in the sync, or there is no alias in the
   apex at all.

   The aliases zone is prone to several types of errors when the copy
   method is used.  The target domain can change the data and while
   subdomains (like www.example.net) still works the zone apex A record
   (example.net) doesn't work.  This could go overlooked for some time
   if the zone owner doesn't do regular checks.  Same condition can
   happen with MX records causing failure to deliver email or it could
   even lead to malicious use if the bad guys happen to own previous
   manually copied MX records.  Also there could be a semi-failures,
   f.e. if the target zone adds AAAA record for IPv6, it will not be
   copied to aliased zone automatically causing IPv6 resolution
   failures.


3.  CNAME at the apex

   This proposal defines new rules for the CNAME record.  RFC 1033
   [RFC1034] defines that:

   There must not be any other RRs associated with a nickname of the
   same class.

   This rule is changed with full compliance with DNSSEC RFCs to:

   There must not be any other RRs with the same owner as the CNAME RR
   with the exception of NS, SOA, DNSKEY, RRSIG and NSEC RRs.


4.  Query processing

   Because of the change of the existing behaviour in the CNAME
   processing there is a need to add a signaling bit for the queries
   issued by resolvers understanding CNAME at the zone apex.

4.1.  Processing by Authoritative Servers

   The authoritative server implementations MUST allow CNAME resource
   record in the zone apex to coexist with NS, SOA, DNSKEY, RRSIG and
   NSEC resource records.  They MUST NOT allow any other resource record
   types in the zone apex when the CNAME resource record is placed in
   the zone apex.

   The authoritative server will return an answer containing specific

   resource record type when asked for SOA, NS, DNSKEY, RRSIG or NSEC RR
   type.  The authoritative server will return an answer containing the
   CNAME if any other RR type is requested in the query.  If the query
   contains the CNAME-at-apex signaling bit then the authoritative
   server will use correct TTL in the zone for the requests in the zone
   apex.  If the query doesn't contain the CNAME-at-apex signaling bit
   then the authoritative server will override TTL in the zone and will
   return answer with 0 TTL for all resource requests in the zone.  This
   should prevent the resolvers to store the result in the cache and
   thus breaking the internal rules for the CNAME.

4.2.  Processing by Recursive Servers

   The resolver compliant with this proposal will issue a query which
   has the CNAME-at-apex signaling bit.  Such resolver MUST NOT deny
   CNAME if it already has other resource record in the cache with the
   same owner with the SOA, NS, DNSKEY, RRSIG or NSEC resource record
   type.  It MUST NOT deny SOA, NS, DNSKEY, RRSIG or NSEC resource
   records if it already has a CNAME resource record in the cache.  The
   compliant resolver SHOULD NOT deny CNAME in the case it has any other
   RR type in the cache and it SHOULD NOT deny any other RR types if it
   already has CNAME records in the cache.

   The rules for the authoritative server is same for the compliant
   resolver acting as an upstream cache.


5.  Security Considerations

   The author is not aware of any security consideration, but he is
   aware that this proposal could create problems for the name servers
   not following the Robustness principle - Be conservative in what you
   send; be liberal in what you accept.
