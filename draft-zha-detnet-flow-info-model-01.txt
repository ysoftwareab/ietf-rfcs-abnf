Abstract 

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides end-to-end absolute 
   delay and loss guarantee to serve real-time applications. DetNet 
   is focused on a general approach that use techniques such as 1) 
   data plane resources reservation for DetNet flows; 2) providing  
   fixed path for DetNet flows; 3)sequentializng, replicating, and 
   eliminating duplicate packets transmission [I-D.finn-detnet-
   architecture] to guarantee the worst case delay of DetNet flow 
   while allow sharing among best effort traffic. Data flow 
   information model is important to the DetNet work that it defines 
   information be used by flow establishment and control protocols. 
   This document describes and DetNet flow information model that 
   represents the flow identifier, traffic description information so 
   that can make resource reservation and provide differentiate 
   service.

1. Introduction 

   Deterministic service with both assured delay and data loss is 
   promising to service providers. Due to lack of deterministic 
   service provisioning mechanism there is no guarantee when 
   deploying a time critical service [RFC3393]. Deterministic 
   Networking (DetNet) tries to provide a solution to this issue with

   limited scope that the data flows are constrained with some 
   maximum data rate properties. DetNet delivers assured end-to-end 
   latency and packet loss by dedicating network resources to DetNet 
   flows while unused reserved resource are still open to best effort 
   traffic. 

   In order to reserve proper amount of network resource to serve the 
   DetNet flow, the DetNet flow first needs to be described with such 
   parameters that can be understood by the network. Secondly, 
   current flow description and resource reservation are mainly 
   focused on bandwidth which is basically a statistical concept 
   during a relative long observation interval. And also, there are 
   different type of use cases those requires deterministic 
   networking services. All these use cases may send different kind 
   of traffics to the network with different deterministic service 
   provisioning requirements [I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases].  

   Data plane techniques such as queuing, shaping, scheduling and 
   preemption are configured in a standard way to guarantee 
   deterministic forwarding behavior in the network device. The 
   controller or control plane takes the description of the DetNet 
   flow and then translates into data plane level configuration to 
   serve the flow. This is the key of DetNet as to define how to 
   describe DetNet flow and how to reserve network resource for it. 
   The flow description should be focused on traffic characteristics 
   of real time service with parameters that could be converted to 
   device level configurations.    

   An information model defines concepts in a uniform way, enabling 
   formal mapping processes to be developed to the information model 
   to a set of data models. This simplifies the process of 
   constructing software to automate the policy management process. 
   It also simplifies the language generation process, though that is 
   beyond the scope of this document.  

   This document describes an information model for representing 
   DetNet flow with comment concept and parameters of a DetNet 
   service that can be mapped into device level configurations.

3. DetNet Flow Information Model  

   According to current charter, DetNet information model is to 
   identify the information needed for flow establishment and control 
   and be used by reservation protocols and data plane configuration. 
   The work will be independent from the protocol(s) used to control 
   the flows. The DetNet information model presented in this document 
   defines some common concept of DetNet flows with information that 
   can be used for flow identification, flow monitoring, performance 
   management, reservation protocol, and data plane configuration. 
   For example, deterministic properties of controlled latency, low 
   packet loss, low packet delay variation, and high reliability. 
   More information can be added in the future. And each part of the 
   information model can be used individually by different network 
   function or network entities. The DetNet information model only 
   defines what kind of information is needed and how it could be 
   used. Data repository, data definition language, query language, 
   implementation language, and protocol should not be defined here. 
   More specifically, the information model can be used by a data 
   model for different scenarios. In [RFC3198], data model is "A 
   mapping of the contents of an information model into a form that 
   is specific to a particular type of data store or repository." 

   In this document, DetNet information model contains three sets of 
   information, flow identifier information, flow metering statistics, 
   and traffic description.  

3.1. Flow Identifier  

   Flow identifier is the first step of flow description as DetNet 
   requires differentiate service so it needs to be identified by the 
   data plane. The DetNet service is described at flow level so each 
   flow could have unique flow identifier.

   As shown in figure 1, network reserves dedicate resource for 
   DetNet flows which will be identified first to use the resource. 
   So a DetNet flow model should first contain information for flow 
   identification. As shown in table 1, the information model has 
   stream identifier and service type information for flow 
   identification.  

3.1.1. Layer 2 Flow Identification  

   Different flow indentifying technique may be used for different 
   networks. DetNet provides layering flow identification models that 
   can be used for both high layer and low layer. In access network 
   which is usually layer 2 network, flow is identified by Vlan and 
   MAC address.

|ServiceType   |              | 
+--------------+--------------+ 
 
3.1.2. Layer 3 Flow Identification  

   In IP/MPLS network, flow identification in layer 3 is needed. For 
   example, a LSP is setup to forward packets destined to particular 
   IP address. If both DetNet flow and non-DetNet flow is sending to 
   same destination, how to provide differentiate service becomes 
   problem. First, the preliminary solution can be just provide 
   DetNet service at user level, which means assuming traffic from 
   particular source should be all performance guaranteed. Second, 
   put additional label for per flow identification.

3.2. Flow Traffic Description  

   The information model should contain traffic description 
   information to define the traffic profile from the source. DetNet 
   flow defines the source guarantee that is the promise of source 
   that the maximum amount traffic it can send. It is a kind of 
   contract between the source and network who serve the flow. If the 
   source is sending overload or different type of traffic, the 
   overload or traffic does not match the predefined traffic profile 
   will be not guaranteed. So the DetNet is that the source tells the 
   network "I will send the traffic like this", and the network will 
   reserve the resource for the flow based on its traffic 
   characteristics as defined in the model.  

   Unlike previous flow model or traffic profile which is mainly 
   based on bandwidth of service, DetNet flow should be more accurate 
   and at lower level for deterministic forwarding. For DetNet 
   service provisioning which is focused on absolute worst case delay, 
   the network needs to know not only the number of packets the flow 
   will be sending but also when or during what period of time the 
   source will be sending what amount of packets. Based on the 
   architecture draft, there are two kinds of flows, synchronous one

+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
 
   The basic idea is that the flow consists of a list of bursts. The 
   Burst is a set of packets with burst duration. The burst is close 
   related to service traffic pattern and also it is dependent on the 
   data plane technique.

Internet-Draft         DetNet Flow Info Model             October 2016 
    

   There are two basic requirements for traffic information 
   definition, first it can be used to describe service; second the 
   parameter defined here can be mapped to data plane configuration. 

3.2.1. Traffic Shaping 

   As mentioned above, DetNet service only guarantee limited traffic 
   with bounded delay. It is usually not easy to regulate source 
   behavior when sending traffic, so shaping is necessary in DetNet 
   working system. Meanwhile, only DetNet traffic that follows the 
   predefined traffic behavior will be served properly, those 
   overloaded will not be guaranteed.  

   On the other hand, shaping procedure as one of the necessary 
   working components needs to de standardized for deterministic 
   delay provisioning. Network or control plane needs to know how the 
   shaping, queuing and scheduling is performed to calculate delay. 
   As shaping and queuing in DetNet is a per-flow based, the flow 
   model contains information about shaping information.  

   There are two commonly used shapers, leaky bucket and token bucket. 
   Leaky bucket is defined to limit both bandwidth and burstiness of 
   packet transmission and is recommended for ATM network with 
   constant output rate. There are multiple implementations of leaky 
   bucket, below is a set of parameters for one leaky bucket model. 
   Token bucket, on the other hand is a shaping and policing model 
   used for many protocols such as RSVP. Below is a Two-Parameter 
   Token Bucket [RFC 3290].

3.3. Flow Statistics 

   As a matter of fact, there is no mechanism to provide flow delay 
   and loss parameter, which is also important for DetNet service. 
   Keeping the knowledge of flow-based delay and loss information is 
   also crucial for OAM and fault management.  

   The detail of flow metering statistic information in the 
   information model will be proposed in next version.

4. Use of Flow Information Model 

   As defined in current charter, DetNet flow information model is 
   used for flow establishment and control and can also be used by 
   reservation protocols and YANG data models. 

4.1. Data Plane Configuration 

   This section proposes a way to map information model parameters 
   into network configuration. As defined in current charter, the 
   DetNet data plane should be TSN compatible. Take TSN TAS (Time 
   Aware Shaper) for example, the information defined in the flow 
   model can be mapped to data plane parameter to configure TSN time 
   aware shaper that provides a deterministic forwarding behavior for 
   the flow. 

   As defined in previous section, information model contains traffic 
   description of DetNet flow that can be used to configure data 
   plane. In this section, take TSN time aware shaper as an example 
   for data plane technique, mapping of data flow parameter to TAS 
   configuration is presented.  

   The basic idea is that, the controller or network control plane 
   takes data flow traffic description as the request and compute the 
   associated time interval and control list of the TAS gate control 
   function. Data flow model contains timing information of the 
   DetNet flow as it arrives at T1 and ends at T2, which can be

   mapped into control list of TAS to reserve an open gate for the 
   DetNet flow for time period T1 to T2. As shown in figure 2, a 
   DetNet flow with data traffic between T1 and T2 send the request 
   to controller or control plane, and then the control plane uses 
   the information to configure the TAS based on current status of 
   TAS. Finally, the TAS function being configured with control list 
   update for open gate transmission for this flow during T1 and T2. 
   As a result, ideally, the flow will be transmitted immediately 
   using the dedicated open gate time slot with absolute delay and 
   loss guarantee.
