Internet-Draft               Ed25519 for SSH                 August 2017


1.  Introduction

   Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4251] is a secure remote-login protocol.  It
   provides for an extensible variety of public key algorithms for
   identifying servers and users to one another.  Ed25519 [RFC8032] is a
   digital signature system.  OpenSSH 6.5 [OpenSSH-6.5] introduced
   support for using Ed25519 for server and user authentication.
   Compatible support for Ed25519 has since been added to other SSH
   implementations.

   This document describes the method implemented by OpenSSH and others,
   and formalizes its use of the name "ssh-ed25519".

   [TO BE REMOVED: Please send comments on this draft to
   curdle@ietf.org.]

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The descriptions of key and signature formats use the notation
   introduced in [RFC4251], Section 3 [RFC4251] and the string data type
   from [RFC4251], Section 5 [RFC4251].

3.  Public Key Algorithm

   This document describes a public key algorithm for use with SSH in
   accordance with [RFC4253], Section 6.6 [RFC4253].  The name of the
   algorithm is "ssh-ed25519".  This algorithm only supports signing and
   not encryption.

4.  Public Key Format

   The "ssh-ed25519" key format has the following encoding:

   string    "ssh-ed25519"
   string    key

   Here 'key' is the 32-octet public key described by [RFC8032],
   Section 5.1.5 [RFC8032].

5.  Signature Algorithm

   Signatures are generated according to the procedure in [RFC8032],
   Section 5.1.6 [RFC8032].

6.  Signature Format

   The "ssh-ed25519" key format has the following encoding:

   string    "ssh-ed25519"
   string    signature

   Here 'signature' is the 64-octet signature produced in accordance
   with [RFC8032], Section 5.1.6 [RFC8032].

7.  Verification Algorithm

   Signatures are verified according to the procedure in [RFC8032],
   Section 5.1.7 [RFC8032].

8.  SSHFP DNS resource records

   The generation of SSHFP resource records for "ssh-ed25519" keys is
   described in [RFC7479].

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document augments the Public Key Algorithm Names in [RFC4250],
   Section 4.6.2 [RFC4250].

   IANA is requested to add to the Public Key Algorithm Names registry
   [IANA-PKA] with the following entry:

                   Public Key Algorithm Name Reference
                   ------------------------- ----------
                   ssh-ed25519               This Draft

   [TO BE REMOVED: This registration should take place at the following
   location: <http://www.iana.org/assignments/ssh-parameters/ssh-
   parameters.xhtml#ssh-parameters-19>]

10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC4251], Section 9 [RFC4251] apply
   to all SSH implementations, including those using Ed25519.

   The security considerations in [RFC8032], Section 8 [RFC8032] apply
   to all uses of Ed25519, including those in SSH.
