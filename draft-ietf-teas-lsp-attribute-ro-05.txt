                  draft-ietf-teas-lsp-attribute-ro-05

Abstract

   RFC5420 extends RSVP-TE to specify or record generic attributes which
   apply to the whole of the path of a Label Switched Path (LSP).  This
   document defines an extension to the RSVP Explicit Route Object (ERO)
   and Record Route Object (RRO) objects to allow it to specify or
   record generic attributes which apply to a given hop.

1.  Introduction

   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) can be route-constrained by making use of the Explicit
   Route object (ERO) and related sub-objects as defined in [RFC3209],
   [RFC3473], [RFC3477], [RFC4873], [RFC4874], [RFC5520] and [RFC5553].
   Several documents have identified the need for attributes that can be
   targeted at specific hops in the path of an LSP, including [RFC6163],
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-wson-signaling], [I-D.ietf-teas-rsvp-te-li-lb] or
   [I-D.ali-ccamp-rc-objective-function-metric-bound].  This document
   provides a generic mechanism for use by these other documents.

   RSVP already supports generic extension of LSP Attributes in
   [RFC5420].  In order to support current and future ERO constraint
   extensions this document provides a mechanism to define per-Hop
   attributes.

   The document describes a generic mechanism for carrying information
   related to specific nodes when signaling an LSP.  This document does
   not restrict what that information can be used for.  The defined
   approach builds on LSP Attributes defined in [RFC5420], and enables
   attributes to be expressed in ERO and Secondary Explicit Route object
   (SERO) objects.  A new ERO sub-object is defined, containing a list
   of generic per-Hop attributes.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  ERO Hop Attributes Subobject

   The ERO Hop Attributes subobject is OPTIONAL.  If used it is carried
   in the ERO or SERO.  The subobject uses the standard format of an ERO
   subobject.

2.1.  Encoding

   The length is variable and content is a list of HOP Attributes TLVs
   defined in Section 2.2.  The size of the ERO sub-object limits the
   size of the attribute TLV to 250 bytes.  The typical size of
   currently defined and forthcoming LSP_ATTRIBUTE TLVs applicable to a
   specific hop (WSON_SIGNALING, Objective Function (OF) and Metric) is
   not foreseen to exceed this limit.

   The ERO Hop Attributes subobject is defined as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |L|    Type     |     Length    |    Reserved                 |R|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      //                      Attributes TLVs                        //
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The L, Type and Length parameters are as defined in [RFC3209]
   Section 4.3.3.  The L bit MUST be set to 0.  The Type for the ERO Hop
   Attributes subobject is TBA-1 by IANA.  The attributes TLV are
   encoded as defined in Section 2.2.

   Reserved  Reserved, MUST be set to 0 when the subobject is inserted
      in the ERO, MUST NOT be changed when a node processes the ERO and
      MUST be ignored on the node addressed by the preceding ERO
      subobjects.

   R  This bit reflects the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE and LSP_ATTRIBUTE
      semantic defined in [RFC5420].  When set it indicates required hop
      attributes to be processed by the node.  When cleared, it
      indicates that the hop attributes are not required as described in
      Section 2.3.

   Attributes TLVs  The TLVs as defined in Section 2.2.

2.2.  HOP Attributes TLVs

   ERO Attributes carried by the new objects defined in this document
   are encoded within TLVs.  Each object MAY contain one or more TLVs.
   There are no ordering rules for TLVs, and interpretation SHOULD NOT
   be placed on the order in which TLVs are received.  The TLV format is
   defined in [RFC5420] Section 3.

   The Attribute Flags TLV defined in [RFC5420] are carried in an ERO
   Hop Attributes Subobject.  Flags set in the an Attribute Flags TLV
   [RFC5420] carried in an ERO Hop Attributes Subobject SHALL be
   interpreted in the context of the received ERO.  Only a subset of
   defined flags are defined as valid for use in Attribute Flags TLV
   carried in an ERO Hop Attributes Subobject.  Invalid flags SHALL be
   silently ignored.  Unknown flags SHOULD trigger the generation of a
   PathErr with Error Code "Unknown Attributes Bit" as defined in
   [RFC5420] Section 5.2.  The set of valid flags are defined in
   Section 4.3.

   The presence and ordering rule of the Attribute Flags TLV in an ERO
   Hop Attributes Subobject is defined by each Flag.  A document
   defining a Flag to be used in an Attribute Flags TLV carried in the
   ERO Hop Attributes Subobject has to describe:

   o  after which kinds of ERO subobject the Flag is valid

   o  if ordering of the Flag and other ERO subobjects associated with
      the same hop (e.g., Label subobjects) is significant,

   o  if ordering is significant, how the Flag is interpreted in
      association with the preceding subobjects,

   o  any Flag modification rules that might apply.

2.3.  Procedures

   As described in [RFC3209] the ERO is managed as a list of subobjects
   each identifying a specific entity, an abstract node or a link that
   defines a waypoint in the network path.  Identifying subobjects of
   various types are defined in [RFC3209], [RFC3477], [RFC4873],
   [RFC4874], [RFC5520] and [RFC5553].

   [RFC3473] modified the ERO list by allowing one or two Label
   subobjects to be interposed in the list after a subobject identifying
   a link.  One or more ERO Hop Attributes subobjects applicable to a
   particular hop MAY be inserted directly after any of the existing
   identifying subobjects defined in[RFC3209], [RFC3477], [RFC4873],
   [RFC4874], [RFC5520] and [RFC5553].  If any Label subobjects are
   present for a hop, the ERO Hop Attributes subobject(s) MAY also be
   inserted after the Label subobjects.

   The attributes specified in an ERO Hop Attributes subobject apply to
   the immediately preceding subobject(s) in the ERO subobject list.

   A document defining a specific Hop Attribute TLV has to describe:

   o  after which kinds of ERO subobject they are valid ,

   o  if ordering of the Hop Attributes subobject and other ERO
      subobjects associated with the same hop (e.g., Label subobjects)
      is significant,

   o  if ordering is significant, how the attribute is interpreted in
      association with the preceding ERO subobjects, and

   o  any TLV modification rules that might apply.

   For instance, subobject presence rules can be defined by describing
   rules similar to [RFC4990] Section 6.1.

   If a node is processing an ERO Hop Attributes subobject and does not
   support handling of the subobject it will behave as described in
   [RFC3209] when an unrecognized ERO subobject is encountered.  This
   node will return a PathErr with error code "Routing Error" and error
   value "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" with the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object
   included, truncated (on the left) to the offending unrecognized
   subobject.

   When the R bit is set a node MUST examine the attribute TLV present
   in the subobject following the rules described in [RFC5420]
   Section 5.2.  When the R bit is not set a node MUST examine the

   attribute TLV present in the subobject following the rules described
   in [RFC5420] Section 4.2.

   A node processing an ERO Hop Attributes subobject with a HOP
   Attributes TLV longer than the ERO subobject SHOULD return a PathErr
   with error code "Routing Error" and error value "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE
   object" with the EXPLICIT_ROUTE object included, truncated (on the
   left) to the offending malformed subobject.  A processing node MUST
   NOT originates a HOP Attributes TLV longer than the ERO HOP
   Attributes Subobject.  The processing of the Hop attribute TLVs
   SHOULD be described in the documents defining them.

3.  RRO Hop Attributes Subobject

   In some cases it is important to determine if an OPTIONAL Hop
   attribute has been processed by a node.

3.1.  Encoding

   The RRO Hop Attributes subobject is OPTIONAL.  If used it is carried
   in the RECORD_ROUTE object.  The subobject uses the standard format
   of an RRO subobject.

   The RRO Hop Attributes subobject is defined as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |      Type     |     Length    |    Reserved                   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                                                               |
      //                      Attributes TLVs                        //
      |                                                               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The Type and Length parameters are as defined in [RFC3209]
   Section 4.4.1.  The Type for the RRO Hop Attributes subobject is
   TBA-2 by IANA.  The attributes TLV are encoded as defined in
   Section 2.2.

   Reserved  Reserved, MUST be set to 0 when the subobject is inserted
      in the RRO, MUST NOT be changed when a node process the RRO and
      MUST be ignored on the node addressed by the preceding RRO
      subobjects.

   Attributes TLVs  The processed or additional HOP Attributes, using
      the format defined in Section 2.2.

3.2.  Procedures

3.2.1.  Subobject Presence Rule

   The RRO rules defined in [RFC3209] are not changed.  The RRO Hop
   Attributes subobject MUST be pushed after the RRO Attributes
   subobject (if present) defined in [RFC5420].  The RRO Hop Attributes
   subobject MAY be present between a pair of subobjects identifying
   Label Switching Router (LSR) or links.  Unless local policy apply all
   such subobjects SHOULD be forwarded unmodified by transit LSRs.

   It is noted that a node (e.g., a domain edge node) MAY edit the RRO
   to prune/modify the RRO, including the RRO Hop Attribute subobject
   before forwarding due to confidentiality policy or other reasons (for
   instance RRO size reduction).

3.2.2.  Reporting Compliance with ERO Hop Attributes

   To report that an ERO Hop attribute has been considered, or to report
   an additional attribute, an LSR can add a RRO Hop Attributes
   subobject with the HOP Attribute TLV which describes the attribute to
   be reported.  The requirement to report compliance MUST be specified
   in the document that defines the usage of a Hop attribute.

3.2.3.  Compatibility with RRO Attributes subobject

   The RRO Hop Attributes subobject extends the capability of the RRO
   Attributes subobject defined in [RFC5420] Section 7.2 by allowing the
   node to report the attribute value.  The mechanism defined in this
   document is compatible with the RRO Attributes subobject using the
   following procedures.

   For LSP attributes signaled in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES or
   LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES objects, a node SHOULD use the RRO Attributes
   subobject to report processing of those attributes.

   For LSP attributes signaled in the ERO Hop Attributes subobject and
   not in the LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES objects, if a
   node desires to report the attributes, it SHOULD use the RRO Hop
   Attributes subobject and SHOULD NOT use the RRO Attributes subobject.
   Ingress nodes not supporting the RRO Hop Attributes subobject will
   drop the information, as described in [RFC3209] Section 4.4.5.

   A node can use the RRO Hop Attribute to report an LSP Attribute
   signaled in LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES only if the
   following conditions are met:

Internet-Draft         General ERO LSP parameters             March 2015


      The Attribute and its corresponding flag is allowed on both the
      LSP_ATTRIBUTES or LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES and LSP Hop Attributes
      subobject.

      The document defining this Attribute specify this specific
      behavior.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  ERO Hop Attribute Subobject

   IANA manages the "RSVP PARAMETERS" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters/rsvp-parameters.xml.
   We request IANA to make an allocation in the Sub-object type 20
   EXPLICIT_ROUTE - Type 1 Explicit Route registry.

   This document introduces a new ERO sub-object:

             Value  Description       Reference
             ------ ----------------- ------------------------
             TBA-1  Hop Attributes    This document, Section 2

4.2.  RRO LSP Attribute Subobject

   IANA manages the "RSVP PARAMETERS" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters/rsvp-parameters.xml.
   We request IANA to make an allocation in the Sub-object type 21
   ROUTE_RECORD - Type 1 Route Record registry.  We request the value to
   be the same as Section 4.1.

   This document introduces a new RRO sub-object:

4.3.  Existing Attribute Flags

   IANA manages the "Attribute Flags" registry as part of the "RSVP-TE
   PARAMETERS" registry located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-
   te-parameters/rsvp-te-parameters.xml.  A new column in the registry
   is introduced by this document.  This column indicates if the flag is
   permitted to be used in an Attribute Flags TLV carried in the ERO Hop
   Attributes Subobject.  The column uses the heading "ERO" and the
   registry is to be updated as follows:

4.4.  Existing LSP Attribute TLVs

   IANA manages the "RSVP-TE PARAMETERS" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-te-parameters/rsvp-te-
   parameters.xml.  The "Attributes TLV Space" registry manage the
   following attributes, as defined in [RFC5420]:

   o  TLV Type (T-field value)

   o  TLV Name

   o  Whether allowed on LSP_ATTRIBUTES object

   o  Whether allowed on LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object

   We request IANA to add the following information for each TLV in the
   RSVP TLV type identifier registry.

   o  Whether allowed on LSP Hop Attributes ERO subobject

   The existing registry is modified for existing TLVs as follows: The
   following abbreviation are used in the table:

   LSP_A  Whether allowed on LSP_ATTRIBUTES object.

   LSP_RA  Whether allowed on LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES object.

   HOP_A  Whether allowed on LSP Hop Attributes subobject.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document adds new subobject in the EXPLICIT_ROUTE and the
   ROUTE_RECORD object carried in RSVP message used in MPLS and GMPLS
   signaling.  It builds on mechanism defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC5420]
   and does not introduce any new security.  The existing security
   considerations described in [RFC2205], [RFC3209], [RFC3473] and
   [RFC5420] do apply.

   As any RSVP-TE signaling request, the procedures defined in this
   document permit the transfer and reporting of functional preferences
   on specific node.  The mechanism added in this document does allow
   more control of LSP attributes at a given node.  As other inputs, a
   node SHOULD check the Hop Attributes against his policies and
   admission procedures.  A node MAY reject the message using existing
   RSVP error code like "Policy Control Failure" or "Admission Control
   Failure".  The node MAY also, depending on the specific TLV
   procedures, modify the requested attribute.  This can reveal
   information about the LSP request and status to anyone with

   unauthorized access.  The mechanism described in this document do not
   contribute to this issue, which can be only resolved by encrypting
   the content of the whole signaling message.

   In addition the reporting of attributes using the RRO can reveal
   details about the node that the operator wishes to remains
   confidential.  The same strategy and policies that apply to other RRO
   subobjects also apply to this new mechanism.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   domain boundary policies take the releasing of RRO hop attributes
   into consideration.
