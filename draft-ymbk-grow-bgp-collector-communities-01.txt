                Marking Announcements to BGP Collectors
              draft-ymbk-grow-bgp-collector-communities-01

Abstract

   When BGP route collectors such as RIPE RIS and Route Views are used
   by operators and researchers, currently one can not tell if a path
   announced to a collector is from the ISP's customer cone, an internal
   route, or one learned from peering or transit.  This greatly reduces
   the utility of the collected data.  This document specifies the use
   of BGP communities to differentiate the kinds of views being
   presented to the collectors.

1.  Introduction

   BGP route collectors such as RIPE RIS [ris] and Route Views [rviews]
   are used by both operators and researchers.  Unfortunately, one can
   not tell if a path announced to a collector is from the ISP's
   customer cone (one's own prefixes and the closure of those to whom
   transit is provided; i.e. what one would announce to a peer), an
   internal route, or an external route learned via peering or transit.
   This greatly reduces the utility of the collected data, and has been
   a cause of much pain over the years.  This document specifies the use
   of BGP communities to differentiate between these categories.

   In 2006, [RFC4384] attempted a similar goal but failed to gain
   traction in the operational community.  We believe this was due to
   its unnecessary complexity.  This document proposes a much simpler
   marking scheme and, if published, will obsolete [RFC4384].

2.  Rationale

   When an operator uses a collector to look at an ISP's announcement of
   a prefix, it is very useful to know if the ISP also announced it to
   their customers and/or peers/transits.  Researchers want to
   differentiate similarly in order to understand expected route
   propagation.

   One usually wishes to ignore any internal-only routes an ISP may
   announce to the collector, as they would not be announcing them to
   peers, transits, or customers.

   An ISP is expected to announce customer routes to their customers,
   and announce customer routes to their external peers and transits.

   In general, one does not need to differentiate whether the ISP will
   announce to peers or transits; and the ISP may not wish to expose the
   business relationships with external providers.  So we do not propose
   to differentiate peers from transit providers.

3.  Categories

   We define only three categories of announcements:

   Customer Cone:  One's own prefixes and the closure of those to whom
      transit is provided including routes announced by BGP customers,
      static prefixes used for non-BGP customers, datacenter routes,
      etc.
   External Routes:  Routes learned from peers and transit providers
      which the ISP would normally announce to customers but not to
      peers.  Often, ISPs do not announce such routes to collectors.
      But, as there is no general practice, this category is important
      to mark.
   Internal Routes:  ISPs occasionally announce to the collector
      Internal point to point and other routes they would not normally
      announce to customers, peers, or transit providers.

4.  Signaling

   BGP announcements to route collectors SHOULD be marked with
   communities indicating into which category the announcement falls.
   As most collector peers already use community markings similar to
   these, but ad hoc, the additional effort should be trivial.

   The ASN in the marking SHOULD be that of the collector peer.  The
   communities were selected from community values which were unused at
   the time of this document and SHOULD be as follows:

5.  IANA Considerations

   As the number of categories is intentionally minimal, an IANA
   registry should not be needed.
