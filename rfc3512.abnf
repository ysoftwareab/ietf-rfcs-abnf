V                                          == spinCounterClockwise(3)

   The response to the GET request at time E will often confuse
   management applications that assume the state of the object should be
   spinCounterClockwise(3).  In reality, the wheel is slowing down in
   order to come to the idle state then begin spinning counter
   clockwise.

   This possibility of confusing and paradoxical interactions of
   administrative and operational state is inevitable when a single
   object type is used to control and report on both types of state.
   One common practice which we have already seen is to separate out the
   desired (settable) state from current state.  The objects
   ifAdminStatus and ifOperStatus from RFC 2863 [20] provide such an
   example of the separation of objects into desired and current state.
