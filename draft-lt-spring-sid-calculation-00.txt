Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
   paths within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of
   topological sub-paths, called "segments".  These segments are
   advertised by the link-state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF).  And
   a segment is identified by a Segment Routing ID (SID).  This document
   proposes a method to calculate SID forwarding entry within SR
   topology in a SR domain, and to guarantee the consistency of SR
   encapsulation forwarding.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end
   paths within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of
   topological sub-paths, called "segments".  The segments for its
   attached prefixes and adjacencies are advertised by the link-state
   routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF).  These segments are called IGP
   segments or IGP SIDs.  And an IGP-Prefix Segment is an IGP segment
   attached to an IGP prefix.  The segments forwarding entries are
   learnt from its attached prefixes' egress information as described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing], where wrote: A node N attaching a
   Prefix-SID SID-R to its attached prefix R MUST maintain the following
   FIB entry: Incoming Active Segment: SID-R Ingress Operation: NEXT
   Egress interface: NULL A remote node M MUST maintain the following
   FIB entry for any learned Prefix-SID SID-R attached to IP prefix R:
   Incoming Active Segment: SID-R Ingress Operation: If the next-hop of
   R is the originator of R and instructed to remove the active segment:
   NEXT Else: CONTINUE Egress interface: the interface towards the next-
   hop along the shortest-path to prefix R.

   In some situations such as the SR need to be calculated as CSPF
   calculation, the path calculated is not the shortest path, so the SR
   needs to have the dependent topology.  with the knowledge learnt from
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing], the SR node does not have the
   state about its neighbours.  With the ldp interoperability as
   described in [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-ldp-interop]
   section 4.2, P6's next-hop for the IGP route "PE3" is not SR capable

   (P7 does not advertise the SR capability).  However, P6 has an LDP
   label binding from that next-hop for the same FEC (e.g.  LDP label
   1037).  Hence, P6 swaps 103 for 1037 and forwards to P7.  The SR node
   needs to judge its neighbour is SR or LDP.  So it is still necessary
   to maintain a SR topology to do the sid calculation.

   This draft describes a mechanism to do the sid calculation.

   PE1\P1\P2\P3\PE2 are routers supporting mpls forwarding, while R5\R6
   are routers do not enable mpls or occurred some error the mpls
   neighbour between R5\R6 is broken.  Such as the SID assigned to PE1
   10001, P1 10002, P2 10003, P3 10004 and PE2 10005.  From PE1 to PE2,
   each link cost between the nodes is 1.  So the shortest path is
   PE1-R5-R6-PE2, with SR forwarding, the next hop with the forwarding
   entry on PE1 to PE2 10005 is to R5 currently.  It will causing the
   mpls encapsulation packets forwarding to R5 who does not support mpls
   forwarding, the packets will be dropped.

                       Figure 2  Scenario 2

   PE1\P1\P2\P3\P4\P5\P6\PE2 are routers supporting MPLS forwarding,
   Such as the SID assigned to PE1 10001, P1 10002, P2 10003, P3 10004,
   PE2 10005, P4 10006, P5 10007.  While P5 and P6 is LDP neighbour, and
   P6 and R7 is LDP neighbour , R7 and PE2 is LDP neighbour, with some
   mistake, the LDP neighbour between P6-R7, R7-PE2 are off, and the IGP
   neighbour between P6-R7, R7-PE2 are still on.  From PE1 to PE2, each
   link cost between the nodes is 1.  So the shortest path is
   PE1-P5-P6-R7-PE2, with SR forwarding, the next hop with the
   forwarding entry on PE1 to PE2 10005 is to P5 currently.  It will
   causing the MPLS encapsulation packets forwarding to P5 with the
   10005 in the outer label, and switches to the LDP label which the P6
   assigned to PE2, and the MPLS packet forwarding to P6, P6 accept the
   mpls packets, and find that the neighbour of the next hop is not ldp
   neighbour, so the packets will be dropped either.

   The problem in the SR dependent IGP topology is that the ingress
   nodes has not have the full information with all the nodes on the
   path.  While the list includes nodes' information, all this nodes in
   the list is SR enabled nodes, but the nodes' information is not all
   the nodes on the path.  So it is necessary to have the independent SR
   topology to support the mixed network.  After all, the network where
   some nodes or links are not enabled mpls capabilities is commonly.

4.  SID calculation

   In the proposed mechanism, the SR will be an independent topology,
   and the SID calculation will be calculated based in the topology.

4.1.  SR independent topology

   The SR topology will be an independent topology based on the SR-
   Capabilities Sub-TLV (as described in
   [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions] and
   [I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions]. ) carried in each

   router's LSP.  If SR node A accepted an lsp sending from node B, with
   the SR-Capabilities Sub-TLV carried in node B's LSP, the node A will
   know that the node B is a SR capable node, and in node A's LSDB, it
   will has an independent SR topology.

4.2.  SID calculation

   With the independent SR topology, SID calculation will be calculated
   in the topology, and the SID forwarding entry will be maintained with
   SID calculation.

   As figure 1 described, PE1 will have an independent topology which
   includes the SID information of PE1\P1\P2\P3\PE2, and will not
   include the information of R5\R6, so when PE1 calculate the SID to
   10005, even though the IGP shortest-path is through R5\R6, PE1 will
   calculate the path to 10005 only in the SR topology.

4.3.  With SRMN or SRMS

   Optionally, If there are some SRMNs or SRMSes assigned by the NMS in
   the network, they assign SID to other SR or non-SR nodes, with the SR
   nodes, the SR nodes will sending out an TLV with it's SID and the SR-
   Capabilities Sub-TLV, then other nodes will learn which nodes are the
   SR nodes.  With the non-SR nodes, this nodes can not sending out the
   SR-Capabilities Sub-TLV, but other SR nodes need to learn this SIDs'
   information, in this case, the SRMNs or SRMSes will sending an
   default label TLV extension out, using the default label to instruct
   the packet with the SID assigned to non-SR node forwarding to itself,
   and then it is responsible for sending the packet to the non-SR node.

4.3.1.  Default label

   Optionally, the default label could either be an reserved and unused
   label, or be configured by the NMS and will be known by each SR node.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD.

6.  Acknowledgements

   In progress.

7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
