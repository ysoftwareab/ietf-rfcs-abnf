Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing Virtual
   Network Configuration (VNC) of the Rapidly Deployable Radio Network
   (RDRN) Network Control Protocol (NCP).

The Network Management Framework


   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components. They are:

      STD 16/RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
      describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.  STD
      16/RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which is
      wholly consistent with the SMI.

      STD 17/RFC 1213 which defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
      objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for net-
      work access to managed objects.

      The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
      experimentation and evaluation.


Objects


   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [3]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

Format of Definitions


   Section 5 contains the specification of all object types contained in
   this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the conventions
   defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [5,6].

Overview

 Network Control Protocol Terminology

     o   "AX.25"

         Asynchronous X.25 Protocol (See [1]).

     o   "Callsign"

         The packet radio callsign is assigned by the FCC and
         identifies the packet radio operator.

     o   "Edge Switch" (ES)

         A node which either resides within the wireless
         network or at the edge of the fixed and
         wireless network and which serves as a base station.

     o   "Global Positioning System" (GPS)

          Satellite system which provides location and time.

     o   "Remote Node" (RN)

         A host with the ability to connect via a beamforming
         antenna to an edge switch (ES).


 Virtual Network Configuration


   Virtual Network Configuration (VNC) allows future states of a system
   to be predicted and used efficiently. VNC is used for the configura-
   tion of a wireless mobile Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network
   known as the Rapidly Deployable Radio Network (RDRN).  Configuration
   in a mobile network must be a dynamic and continuous process.  Fac-
   tors such as load, distance, capacity and topology are all constantly
   changing in a mobile environment. The VNC algorithm anticipates con-
   figuration changes and speeds the reconfiguration process by pre-
   computing and caching results.  The Global Positioning System (GPS)
   is a key element in the implementation of this algorithm because it
   provides location information and accurate time for each node.  The
   effort required to enhance network configuration with Virtual Network
   Configuration is minimal. New fields are added to each existing mes-
   sage and additional structures are added to existing processes.  The
   benefit of prediction is gained at the cost of additional traffic and
   processing.

 Virtual Network Configuration Algorithm

   The Virtual Network Configuration (VNC) algorithm is an application

   of a more general mechanism called Time Warp Emulation (TWE). Time
   Warp Emulation is a modification of Time Warp.  The motivation behind
   TWE is to allow the actual components of a real-time system to work
   ahead in time in order to predict future behavior and adjust them-
   selves when that behavior does not match reality. This is accom-
   plished by realizing that there are now two types of false messages,
   those which arrive in the past relative to the process's Local Vir-
   tual Time (LVT) and those messages which have been generated which
   are time-stamped with the current real time, but whose values exceed
   some tolerance from the component's current value.

   The basic Time Warp mechanism is modified by adding a verification
   query phase. This phase occurs when real time matches the receive
   time of a message in the output queue of a process. In this phase,
   the physical device being emulated in time is queried and the results
   compared with the value of the message. A value exceeding a prespeci-
   fied tolerance will cause a rollback of the process.

   The Virtual Network Configuration (VNC) algorithm can be explained by
   an example.  A remote node's direction, velocity, bandwidth used,
   number of connections, past history and other factors can be used to
   approximate a new configuration sometime into the future. All actual
   configuration processes can begin to work ahead in time to where the
   remote node is expected to be at some point in the future. If the
   prediction is incorrect, but not far off, only some processing will
   have to be rolled back in time. For example, the beamsteering process
   results may have to be adjusted, but the topology and many higher
   level requirements will still be correct. Working ahead and rolling
   back to adjust for error with reality is an on-going process, which
   depends on the tradeoff between allowable risk and amount of process-
   ing time allowed into the future.

 Virtual Network Configuration Implementation

   The effort required to enhance the network configuration algorithm to
   include Virtual Network Configuration is minimal. Three new fields
   are added to each existing message: antimessage toggle, send time,
   and receive time. Physical processes include beamforming, topology
   acquisition, table updates, and all processing required for configu-
   ration. Each physical process is assigned a tolerance. When the value
   of a real message exceeds the tolerance of a predicted message stored
   in the send queue, the process is rolled back.

   Also, an additional packet type was created for updating an approxi-
   mation of the Global Virtual Time (GVT). Because the system is com-
   posed of asynchronously executing logical processes, each working
   ahead as quickly as possible with its own local notion of time, it is
   necessary to calculate the time of the system as a whole.  This

Internet-Draft        Virtual Network Configuration      13 January 1997


   system-wide time is the GVT. The difference between GVT and current
   time is the amount of lookahead, Lambda. Although GVT >= t where t is
   real time, Lambda is required because it is used to control the effi-
   ciency and accuracy of the system. Since the network configuration
   system uses a master node as described in the physical layer setup,
   this is a natural centralized location for a centralized GVT update
   method.  RNs transmit their LVT to the master, the master calculates
   an approximate GVT and returns the result.

   The Rapidly Deployable Radio Network (RDRN) consists of links formed
   by beamforming antennas. While beamforming allows improved spectrum
   usage through spatial reuse, it poses a challenge to configure. Each
   mobile node and base station contains a GPS receiver and is aware of
   its current location. This information is shared among nodes and an
   optimal topology for beamformed links is determined.  The protocol
   which carries this information is known as the network control proto-
   col (NCP). The NCP is carried over an omni-directional packet radio
   overlay network. See reference [8] and [9] for detailed information
   about the operation of NCP.

 Virtual Network Configuration MIB Overview


   A very brief overview of VNC components and operation will be pro-
   vided in this section.  The VNC algorithm is an extension of opti-
   mistic parallel simulation [10] and accomplishes configuration of a
   mobile wireless ATM network including handoff.  A driving process
   injects virtual messages into the VNC system.  Virtual messages are
   similar to real messages except that they exist in the future and are
   thus predictions of future events.

   VNC consists of Logical Processes (LP) which communicate via mes-
   sages. An LP is comprised of a State Queue, Receive Queue, and Send
   Queue. Each LP State has an associated tolerance. If messages arrive
   out of order or beyond the given tolerance, a rollback occurs.  Roll-
   backs produce anti-messages which cancel the effects of causality
   violations and inaccurate VNC predictions. The system may contain a
   global virtual time calculation (GVT) and global lookahead parameter
   (LA). The MIB objects described below manage each of these compo-
   nents.  The GvtUpdate MIB object manages the rate at which a simple
   polling algorithm for GVT calculation is performed. The StepSize
   object controls the rate of virtual messages generation from the
   driving process.
