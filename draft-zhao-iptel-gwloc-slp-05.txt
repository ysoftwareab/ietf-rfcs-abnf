1. Introduction

   In the Internet telephony networks, an administrative domain has one
   or multiple location servers [RFC2871], and has numerous gateways
   that link the Internet to the Public Switched Telephone Network
   (PSTN). When a call arrives, a location server in the domain routes
   the call to one of these gateways. Figure 1 shows the typical
   scenario.

                                | incoming call

        Figure 1. Gateway Selection for Internet Telephony

   The gateway selection at the location server depends on many factors,
   including gateway availability, capacity, and cost for terminating a
   particular call. Obtaining the up-to-date gateway information is
   critical for a location server to route phone calls properly.

   This document describes how to use the Service Location Protocol (SLP
   [RFC2608]) for the gateway and location server interaction. It
   defines the "service:iptel-gw" template for the Internet telephony
   gateway service, and discusses the different usage scenarios and the
   applicability of SLP for the Internet telephony gateway location.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. SLP Overview

   SLP provides a scalable framework for service discovery and selection
   within one administrative domain. A service is described using a set
   of attributes, which is defined in the service template [RFC2609].

Internet Draft          Gateway Location via SLP         August 28, 2002


   An SLP system has three different entities: User Agent (UA), Service
   Agent (SA), and Directory Agent (DA). Normally, applications are
   bound to UAs and services to SAs. DAs may be deployed to cache
   service registrations from SAs to enhance the system scalability.
   Without DAs, a UA needs to query all SAs via multicast. If DAs are
   deployed, SAs register with DAs, and UAs query DAs, both via unicast.

   SLP uses both push and pull to disseminate service information. SAs
   can push service registrations to DAs via unicast, or perform
   notification to all UAs via multicast [RFC3082]. UAs can pull service
   information from all SAs via multicast, or from a DA via unicast.

3. Using SLP for Internet Telephony Gateway Location

   As a key constraint of Internet telephony is to minimize the call
   setup delay, a location server SHOULD reduce the time of gateway
   selection as much as possible. It is desirable that a location server
   has required gateway information before a call arrives. Otherwise, it
   will incur a longer call setup delay if a location server pulls
   gateway information after a call has arrived. Thus, the interaction
   of gateways and location servers shall use a push model: gateways
   push their information to location servers.

   To push gateway information to location servers, the mechanism
   described in RFC 3082 [RFC3082] can be used if multicast is
   supported. When multicast is not available or cannot be used for some
   reasons, the mechanism described in the next section can be used.

4. Pushing Gateway Information via Unicast

   To push gateway information to location servers via unicast, each
   location server needs to use a dedicated SLP DA. Figure 2 shows the
   architecture. The dedicated DA is a standard SLP DA, but it SHOULD
   use a special scope for the "iptel-gw" service (this DA may support
   other scopes if needed). The default value for this special scope is
   "iptel-gw", but it could be set to some other value administratively.
   Using a special scope for the "iptel-gw" service can ensure that
   "service:iptel-gw" registrations are only sent to dedicated DAs at
   location servers, other service registrations will not be sent to
   these dedicated DAs if they only support one special scope for the
   "iptel-gw" service.

   Note that binding applications to DAs is not the common usage model
   for SLP DAs. This usage is motivated by performance and timeliness
   requirements of Internet telephony, where a location server needs to
   frequently consult the gateway information to make routing decisions,
   and the lookup time must be short.

   When multiple location servers are deployed in a domain, a gateway
   may need to push its information to several location servers. By
   using the SLP mesh-enhancement [mSLP], a gateway only needs to push
   its information to one location server, then the information will be
   propagated automatically to other location servers. In general, a
   location server may use multiple gateways, and a gateway may serve
   multiple location servers.

     Figure 2. Push Gateway Information to Location Servers via Unicast

4.1. Gateway Operations

   A gateway uses an SLP SA to advertise its service. It registers its
   information with location servers using the "service:iptel-gw"
   template, refreshes its registration periodically, updates its
   registration whenever it is needed, and de-registers its information
   when its service is no longer available. A gateway discovers location
   servers using standard SLP DA discovery mechanisms, including static
   configuration, DHCP [RFC2610], passively listening for DAAdvert (DA
   Advertisement) multicast, and actively sending the
   "service:directory-agent" SrvRqst (Service Request) multicast.

4.2. Location Server Operations

   A location server uses an SLP DA as its front end to accept and store
   gateway registrations. Normally the location server and its front end

   DA are in the same machine. The location server uses an SLP UA to
   issue SLP requests via LOOPBACK to the local DA (Figure 3). This
   polling has a lower cost compared with a non-local UA-DA query.

   When a call arrives, the location server looks up the gateway
   information, and routes the call to a gateway properly. To find the
   best gateway for a call, the location server can use a SrvRqst
   followed by AttrRqst(s) (Attribute Request) to obtain relevant
   attribute information of gateways, then it makes a choice by itself.
   Note that the location server can use the Attribute List Extension
   [RFC3059] in the SrvRqst to optimize the above operations.

5. Template for Internet Telephony Gateway Service

   The "service:iptel-gw" template defines the attributes associated
   with the Internet telephony gateway service. Please refer to RFC 2609
   [RFC2609] for detailed explanation of the syntax.

   Language of service template: en (English)

   Security Considerations:
      Internet telephony gateway services are likely to be paid
      services, so that there could be a particular incentive to modify
      somebody else's registrations. The standard SLP authentication
      mechanism SHOULD be used for accepting service registrations.

6. Discussion

   In this section, we show that SLP can meet the requirements of the
   Internet telephony gateway discovery.

   (1) Fast: Using SLP, gateways send their registrations to location
   servers in advance. During a call setup, a location server only
   queries its local SLP DA to find the proper gateway.

   (2) Failure Detection: Using SLP, gateway availability can be decided
   in two ways. First, as each registration is a soft state, an expired
   registration will be removed, which indicates the corresponding
   gateway is not available. Second, a gateway can de-register its
   service information with location servers.

   (3) Startup Detection: Using SLP, a recovered gateway can send a new
   registration to location servers to notify its availability.

   (4) Capacity Knowledge: Using SLP, the capacity information is
   carried in the gateway registration, as specified in the
   "service:iptel-gw" service template.

   (5) Secure: SLP has authentication mechanism.

   (6) Routing Information: Using SLP, the routing information is
   carried in the gateway registration, as specified via the "iptel-gw-
   prefix-list" attribute in the "service:iptel-gw" service template.

   (7) Timeliness: Using SLP, a gateway can update its service
   registration whenever it is needed. A wide range of updating interval
   is supported in SLP, from a few seconds to several hours.

   (8) Extensible Attributes: Using SLP, new attributes for the
   "service:iptel-gw" service template can be defined and added later.

   (9) Efficient: Gateway registrations at location servers can be
   refreshed or updated in a wide range of interval: from a few seconds
   to several hours. Thus, registration traffic is modest, and is

Internet Draft          Gateway Location via SLP         August 28, 2002


   demand-driven in most cases. Also, all registrations are performed in
   unicast. Furthermore, each location server accesses the gateway
   information locally (on the same machine).

   (10) Routing Control: Using SLP, gateway information is collected by
   SLP DAs, each location server makes its own routing decision.

   (11) Independent Policies: If multiple location servers exist within
   one administrative domain, gateways register with all available
   location servers. Using SLP, location servers can adopt different
   policies, and make different routing decisions.

7. Security Considerations

   Internet telephony gateway services are likely to be paid services,
   so that there could be a particular incentive to modify somebody
   else's registrations. The standard SLP authentication mechanism
   SHOULD be used for accepting service registrations.
