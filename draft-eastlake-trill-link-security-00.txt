                          TRILL: Link Security
              <draft-eastlake-trill-link-security-00.txt>


Abstract

   The TRILL protocol supports arbitrary link technologies between TRILL
   switches, both point-to-point and broadcast links, and supports
   Ethernet links between edge TRILL switches and end stations.
   Communications links are constantly under attack by criminals and
   national intelligence agencies as discussed in RFC 7258. Link
   security is an important element of security in depth, particularly
   for links that are not entirely under the physical control of the
   TRILL network operator or that include device which may have been
   compromised. This document specifies link security recommendations
   for TRILL over Ethernet, PPP, and pseudowire links taking into
   account performance considerations. It updates RFC 6325, 6361, and
   7173. It requires that all TRILL packets between links ports capable
   of encryption at line speed MUST default to being encrypted. [This is
   an early partial draft.]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      TRILL: Link Security


1. Introduction

   [This is an early partial draft.]

   The TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links or Tuneled
   Routing in the Link Layer) protocol supports arbitrary link
   technologies including both point-to-point and broadcast links and
   supports Ethernet links between edge TRILL switches and end stations.
   Communications links are constantly under attack by criminals and
   national intelligence agencies as discussed in [RFC7258].  Link
   security in an important element of security in depth for links,
   paticularly those that are not entirely under the physical control of
   the TRILL network operator or that include device which may have been
   compromised.

   TRILL generally uses an existing link security method specified for
   the technology of the link in question. TRILL provides
   autoconfiguration assistance and default keying material, under most
   circumstances, to support the TRILL goal of having a minimal or zero
   configuration default. Where better security is not available, TRILL
   supports opportunistic security [RFC7435].

   This document specifies security recommendations for TRILL over
   Ethernet [RFC6325], TRILL over PPP [RFC6361], and transport of TRILL
   by pseudowires [RFC7173], in Sections 3, 4, and 5 respectively.
   Although the Security Considerations sections of these RFCs mention
   link security, this document goes further, updating these RFCs as
   decribed in Appendix A and imposing the new encryption requirement
   summarized in Section 1.1.

   [TRILL-IP] is expected to cover TRILL security over IP links.



1.1 Encryption Requirement and Adjacency

   This document requires that all TRILL packets between TRILL switch
   ports that are capable of encryption at line speed MUST default to
   being encrypted and authenticated. It MUST require explicit
   configuration in such cases for the ports to communicate unencrypted
   or unsecured. Line speed encrption and authentication usually
   requires hardware assist but there are cases with slower ports and
   higher powered switch processors where it can be accomplished in
   sofware.

   If line speed encryption and authentication is not available for
   communication between TRILL switch ports, it MUST still be possible
   to configure the TRILL switches and ports involved to encrypt and
   authenticate all TRILL packets sent for cases where the security
   provided outweighs any reduction in performance.

1.2 Terminology and Acronyms

   This document uses the acronyms and terms defined in [RFC6325], some
   of which are repeated below for convenience, and additional acronyms
   and terms listed below.

   HKDF: Hash based Key Derivation Function [RFC5869].

   Link: The means by which adjacent TRILL switches are connected. May
         be various technologies and in the common case of Ethernet, can
         be a "bridged LAN", that is to say, some combination of
         Ethernet links with zero or more bridges, hubs, repeaters, or
         the like.

   MACSEC: Media Access Control (MAC) Security. IEEE Std 802.1AE-2006.

   MPLS: Multi-Protocol Label Switching.

   PPP: Point-to-point protocol [RFC1661].

   RBridge: An alternative name for a TRILL switch.

   TRILL: Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links or Tunneled
         Routing in the Link Layer.

   TRILL switch: A device implementing the TRILL protocol. An
         alternative name for an RBridge.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

2. Link Security Default Keying

   In some cases, it is possible to use keying material derived from the
   [RFC5310] IS-IS keying material already in place. In such cases, the
   two byte [RFC5310] Key ID identifies the IS-IS keying material. The
   keying material actually used in the link security protocol is
   derived from the IS-IS keying material as follows:

      HKDF-Expand-SHA256 ( IS-IS-key, "TRILL Link" | custom, L )

   where "|" indicates concatenation, HKDF is the Hash base Key
   Derivation Function in [RFC5869], SHA256 is as in [RFC6234], IS-IS-
   key is the input keying material, "TRILL Link" is the 10-character
   ASCII [RFC20] string indicated, "custom" is a byte string dependeng
   on the link security protocol being used, and L is the length of
   output keying material needed.

3. Ethernet Links

   TRILL over Ethernet is specified in [RFC6325] with some additional
   material on Ethernet link MTU in [rfc7180bis].

   Link security between TRILL switch Ethernet ports conforms to IEEE
   Std 802.1AE-2006 [802.1AE] as amended by IEEE Std 802.1AEbn-2011
   [802.1AEbn] and IEEE Std 802.1AEbw-2013 [802.1AEbw]. This security is
   referred to as MACSEC.



3.1 Between TRILL Switches

   TRILL switch Ethernet ports MUST implement MACSEC. When TRILL switch
   ports are directly connected by Ethernet with no intervening customer
   bridges, for example by a point to point Ethernet link, MACSEC
   between them operates as specified herein. There can be intervening
   Provider Bridges or other forms of transparent Ethernet tunnels.

   However, if there are one or more customer bridges or similar devices
   in the path, MACSEC at the TRILL switch port will peer with the
   nearest such bridge port. This reaults, from the point of view of
   MACSEC, with a two or more hop path. Typically, the TRILL switch
   ports at the ends of such a path would be unable to negotiate
   security and agree on keys so, in cases where encryption and
   authenication are required, they would be unable to establish IS-IS
   communication and would not form an adjacency [RFC7177]. However, it
   may be possible to configure such bridge ports and distribute such
   keying material or the like to them so that encryption and
   authentication can be established on all hops of such mulit-hop
   Ethernet paths. Methods for accomplishing such distribution to
   devices other than TRILL switches are beyond the scope of this
   document.

   When MACSEC is established between adjacent TRILL switch ports, the
   frames are as shown in Figure 1. The optional VLAN tagging shown is
   superfluous in the case of TRILL Data and IS-IS packets. Unless there
   are VLAN sensitive devices intervening between the TRILL switch
   ports, or possibly attached to the link between those ports, TRILL
   Data and IS-IS packets SHOULD generally be sent untagged for
   efficiency.

   Of course there may be other Ethernet control frames, such as link
   aggregation control messages or priority based flow control messages,
   that would also be sent within MACSEC. Typically only the [802.1X]
   messages used to establish and maintain MACSEC are sent unsecured.

3.2 Ethernet Security to End Stations

   MACSEC may be used between end stations and their adjacent TRILL
   switch(es) or end-to-end between end stations or both. Since TRILL
   does not impose administrative requirements on end stations, the
   choice of keying and crypto suite are beyond the scope of this
   document.

   The end station must be properly configured to know if it should
   apply MACSEC to secure its connection to an edge TRILL switch or to
   remote end stations or both.

   The Figure below show an Ethernet frame between a TRILL switch and
   the adjacent edge RBridge secured by MACSEC.

4. PPP Links

   TRILL over PPP is specified in [RFC6361]. Currently specified native
   PPP security does not meet modern security standards. However, true
   PPP over HDLC is relatively uncommon today and PPP is normally being
   conveyed by another protocol, such as PPP over Ethernet or PPP over
   IP. In those cases it is RECOMMENDED that Ethernet security as
   described in Section 3 or IP security as described in [TRILL-IP] be
   used to secure PPP between TRILL switch ports.

   If it is necessary to use native PPP security [RFC1968] [RFC1994]
   ...tbd...

5. Pseudowire Links

   TRILL transport over pseudowires is specified in [RFC7173].

   No native security is provided for pseudowires as such; however, they
   are, by definition, carried by some PSN (Packet Switched Network).
   Link security must be provided by this PSN or by lower level
   protocols. This PSN is typically an MPLS or IP PSN.

   In the case of a pseudowire over IP, security SHOULD be provided as
   is expected to be specified in [TRILL-IP]. If that is not possible
   but the IP path is only one IP hop, then it may be possible to
   provide link security at the layer of the link protocol supporting
   that hop, such as Ethernet (Section 3) or PPP (Section 4).

   In the case of a pseudowire over MPLS, MPLS also does not have a
   native security scheme. Thus, security must be provided at the link
