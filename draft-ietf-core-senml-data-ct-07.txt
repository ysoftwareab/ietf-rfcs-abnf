               SenML Data Value Content-Format Indication
                    draft-ietf-core-senml-data-ct-07

Abstract

   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type supports multiple
   types of values, from numbers to text strings and arbitrary binary
   data values.  In order to facilitate processing of binary data
   values, this document specifies a pair of new SenML fields for
   indicating the content format of those binary data values, i.e.,
   their Internet media type including parameters as well as any content
   codings applied.

1.  Introduction

   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media types [RFC8428] can be
   used to send various kinds of data.  In the example given in
   Figure 1, a temperature value, an indication whether a lock is open,
   and a data value (with SenML field "vd") read from an NFC reader is
   sent in a single SenML pack.  The example is given in SenML JSON
   representation, so the "vd" (data value) field is encoded as a
   base64url string (without padding), as per Section 5 of [RFC8428].

   [
     {"bn":"urn:dev:ow:10e2073a01080063:","n":"temp","u":"Cel","v":7.1},
     {"n":"open","vb":false},
     {"n":"nfc-reader","vd":"aGkgCg"}
   ]

             Figure 1: SenML pack with unidentified binary data

   The receiver is expected to know how to interpret the data in the
   "vd" field based on the context, e.g., name of the data source and
   out-of-band knowledge of the application.  However, this context may
   not always be easily available to entities processing the SenML pack,

Internet-Draft    SenML Data Content-Format Indication      October 2021


   especially if the pack is propagated over time and via multiple
   entities.  To facilitate automatic interpretation it is useful to be
   able to indicate an Internet media type and, optionally, content
   codings right in the SenML Record.

   The CoAP Content-Format (Section 12.3 of [RFC7252]) provides this
   information in the form of a single unsigned integer; enclosing a
   Content-Format number (in this case number 60 as defined for content-
   type application/cbor in [RFC8949]) in the Record is illustrated in
   Figure 2.  All registered CoAP Content-Format numbers are listed in
   the COAP Content-Formats registry [IANA.core-parameters] as specified
   by Section 12.3 of [RFC7252].  Note that, at the time of writing, the
   structure of this registry only provides for zero or one content
   codings; nothing in the present document needs to change if the
   registry is extended to allow sequences of content codings.

   {"n":"nfc-reader", "vd":"gmNmb28YKg", "ct":"60"}

         Figure 2: SenML Record with binary data identified as CBOR

   In this example SenML Record, the data value contains a string "foo"
   and a number 42 encoded in a CBOR [RFC8949] array.  Since the example
   above uses the JSON format of SenML, the data value containing the
   binary CBOR value is base64-encoded (Section 5 of [RFC4648]).  The
   data value after base64 decoding is shown with CBOR diagnostic
   notation in Figure 3.

   82           # array(2)
      63        # text(3)
         666F6F # "foo"
      18 2A     # unsigned(42)

1.1.  Evolution

   As with SenML in general, there is no expectation that the creator of
   a SenML pack knows (or has negotiated with) each consumer of that
   pack, which may be very remote in space and particularly in time.
   This means that the SenML creator in general has no way to know
   whether the consumer knows:

   *  each specific media-type-name used

   *  each parameter and each parameter value used

   *  each content coding in use

Internet-Draft    SenML Data Content-Format Indication      October 2021


   *  each Content-Format number in use for a combination of these

   What SenML, as well as the new fields defined here, guarantees is
   that a recipient implementation _knows_ when it needs to be updated
   to understand these field values and the values controlled by them;
   registries are used to evolve these name spaces in a controlled way.
   SenML packs can be processed by a consumer while not understanding
   all the information in them, and information can generally be
   preserved in this processing such that it is useful for further
   consumers.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Media Type:  A registered label for representations (byte strings)
      prepared for interchange, identified by a Media-Type-Name
      [RFC1590], [RFC6838].

   Media-Type-Name:  A combination of a type-name and a subtype-name
      registered in [IANA.media-types] as per [RFC6838], conventionally
      identified by the two names separated by a slash.

   Content-Type:  A Media-Type-Name, optionally associated with
      parameters (Section 5 of [RFC2045], separated from the Media-Type-
      Name and from each other by a semicolon).  In HTTP and many other
      protocols, used in a Content-Type header field.

   content coding:  A name registered in the HTTP Content Coding
      registry [IANA.http-parameters] as specified by Sections 16.6.1
      and 18.6 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics], indicating an encoding
      transformation with semantics further specified in Section 8.4.1
      of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics].  Confusingly, in HTTP, content
      coding values are found in a header field called "Content-
      Encoding", however "content coding" is the correct term for the
      process and the registered values.

   content format:  the combination of a Content-Type and zero or more
      content codings, identified by (1) a numeric identifier defined in
      the COAP Content-Formats registry [IANA.core-parameters] as per
      Section 12.3 of [RFC7252] (referred to as Content-Format number),
      or (2) a Content-Format-String.

   Content-Format-String:  the string representation of the combination



Keränen & Bormann         Expires 24 April 2022                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    SenML Data Content-Format Indication      October 2021


      of a Content-Type and zero or more content codings.

   Content-Format-Spec:  the string representation of a content format;
      either a Content-Format-String or the (decimal) string
      representation of a Content-Format number.

   Readers should also be familiar with the terms and concepts discussed
   in [RFC8428].

3.  SenML Content-Format ("ct") Field

   When a SenML Record contains a Data Value field ("vd"), the Record
   MAY also include a Content-Format indication field, using label "ct".
   The value of this field is a Content-Format-Spec, i.e., one of:

   *  a CoAP Content-Format number in decimal form with no leading zeros
      (except for the value "0" itself).  This value represents an
      unsigned integer in the range of 0-65535, similar to the "ct"
      attribute defined in Section 7.2.1 of [RFC7252] for CoRE Link
      Format [RFC6690]).

   *  or a Content-Format-String containing a Content-Type and zero or
      more content codings (see below).

   The syntax of this field is formally defined in Section 6.

   The CoAP Content-Format number provides a simple and efficient way to
   indicate the type of the data.  Since some Internet media types and
   their content coding and parameter alternatives do not have assigned
   CoAP Content-Format numbers, using Content-Type and zero or more
   content codings is also allowed.  Both methods use a string value in
   the "ct" field to keep its data type consistent across uses.  When
   the "ct" field contains only digits, it is interpreted as a CoAP
   Content-Format number.

   To indicate that one or more content codings are used with a Content-
   Type, each of the content coding values is appended to the Content-
   Type value (media type and parameters, if any), separated by a "@"
   sign, in the order of the content codings were applied (the same
   order as in Section 8.4 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics]).  For
   example (using a content coding value of "deflate" as defined in
   Section 8.4.1.2 of [I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics]):

   text/plain; charset=utf-8@deflate

   If no "@" sign is present after the media type and parameters, then
   no content coding has been specified, and the "identity" content
   coding is used -- no encoding transformation is employed.

Internet-Draft    SenML Data Content-Format Indication      October 2021


4.  SenML Base Content-Format ("bct") Field

   The Base Content-Format Field, label "bct", provides a default value
   for the Content-Format Field (label "ct") within its range.  The
   range of the base field includes the Record containing it, up to (but
   not including) the next Record containing a "bct" field, if any, or
   up to the end of the pack otherwise.  The process of resolving
   (Section 4.6 of [RFC8428]) this base field is performed by adding its
   value with the label "ct" to all Records in this range that carry a
   "vd" field but do not already contain a Content-Format ("ct") field.

   Figure 4 shows a variation of Figure 2 with multiple records, with
   the "nfc-reader" records resolving to the base field value "60" and
   the "iris-photo" record overriding this with the "image/png" media
   type (actual data left out for brevity).

   [
     {"n":"nfc-reader", "vd":"gmNmb28YKg",
      "bct":"60", "bt":1627430700},
     {"n":"nfc-reader", "vd":"gmNiYXIYKw", "t":10},
     {"n":"iris-photo", "vd":".....", "ct":"image/png", "t":10},
     {"n":"nfc-reader", "vd":"gmNiYXoYLA", "t":20}
   ]

5.  Examples

   The following examples are valid values for the "ct" and "bct" fields
   (explanation/comments in parentheses):

   *  "60" (CoAP Content-Format number for "application/cbor")

   *  "0" (CoAP Content-Format number for "text/plain" with parameter
      "charset=utf-8")

   *  "application/json" (JSON Content-Type -- equivalent to "50" CoAP
      Content-Format number)

   *  "application/json@deflate" (JSON Content-Type with "deflate" as
      content coding -- equivalent to "11050" CoAP Content-Format
      number)

   *  "application/json@deflate@aes128gcm" (JSON Content-Type with
      "deflate" followed by "aes128gcm" as content codings)

   *  "text/csv" (Comma-Separated Values (CSV) [RFC4180] Content-Type)

   *  "text/csv;header=present@gzip" (CSV with header row, using "gzip"
      as content coding)

6.  ABNF

   This specification provides a formal definition of the syntax of
   Content-Format-Spec strings using ABNF notation [RFC5234], which
   contains three new rules and a number of rules collected and adapted
   from various RFCs [I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics] [RFC6838] [RFC5234]
   [RFC8866].

   ; New in this document

   Content-Format-Spec = Content-Format-Number / Content-Format-String

   Content-Format-Number = "0" / (POS-DIGIT *DIGIT)
   Content-Format-String   = Content-Type *("@" Content-Coding)

   ; Cleaned up from [RFC-httpbis-semantics],
   ; leaving only SP as blank space,
   ; removing legacy 8-bit characters, and
   ; leaving the parameter as mandatory with each semicolon:

7.  Security Considerations

   The indication of a media type in the data does not exempt a
   consuming application from properly checking its inputs.  Also, the
   ability for an attacker to supply crafted SenML data that specify
   media types chosen by the attacker may expose vulnerabilities of
   handlers for these media types to the attacker.  This includes
   "decompression bombs", compressed data that is crafted to decompress
   to extremely large data items.

8.  IANA Considerations

   (Note to RFC Editor: Please replace all occurrences of "RFC-AAAA"
   with the RFC number of this specification and remove this note.)

   IANA is requested to assign new labels in the "SenML Labels"
   subregistry of the SenML registry [IANA.senml] (as defined in
   Section 12.2 of [RFC8428]) for the Content-Format indication as per
   Table 1:
