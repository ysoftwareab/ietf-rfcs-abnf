                   M-LDP Signaling Through BIER Core
                    draft-hj-bier-mldp-signaling-00

Abstract 

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is an architecture that
   provides multicast forwarding through a "BIER domain" without
   requiring intermediate routers to maintain multicast related per-flow
   state.  Neither does BIER require an explicit tree-building protocol
   for its operation.  A multicast data packet enters a BIER domain at a
   "Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router" (BFIR), and leaves the BIER domain at
   one or more "Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers" (BFERs).  The BFIR router
   adds a BIER header to the packet.  Such header contains a bit-string
   in which each bit represents exactly one BFER to forward the packet
   to.  The set of BFERs to which the multicast packet needs to be
   forwarded is expressed by the according set of bits switched on in
   BIER packet header.

   This document describes the procedure needed for mLDP tunnels to be
   signaled and stitched through a BIER core. Allowing LDP routers to
   run traditional Multipoint LDP services through a BIER core.

1. Introduction

   This draft extends draft-ietf-bier-pim-signaling to mLDP. 

   Some operators would like to deploy BIER technology in some segment
   of their network. This draft explains a method to signal mLDP
   services and stitch it to a BIER domain, with minimal disruption and
   operational impact to the mLDP domain.

   This draft explains the procedures needed to signal and uniquely
   identify a mLDP P2MP LSP in a BIER domain.

                     Figure 1: bier boundary router

   As per figure 1, the procedures of mLDP signaling is done at the BIER
   boundary routers. The BIER boundary router (BBR) are connected to LDP
   capable routers toward the LDP domain and BIER routers toward the
   BIER domain. LDP routers in LDP domain continue to send LDP signaling
   messages to the BBR. The BBR will create LDP adjacency between all
   the LDP routers attach to it on the LDP domain. That said the BBR
   does not propagate the LDP Signaling packets natively into the BIER
   domain. Instead when it determines that the label mapping or withdraw
   message needs to be signaled through the BIER domain, it will execute
   the procedures in this document to uniquely identify and stitch the
   P2MP LSP through the BIER domain. These procedures are achievable via
   an SDN Controller or signaling of the the mLDP FEC through the BIER
   domain, depending on the method. For the latter method this signaling
   is not for creating a mLDP adjacency between the two disjoint ldp
   domains through the BIER network.

   The terminology ingress BBR (ibbr) and egress BBR (ebbr) are relative
   from signaling point of view.

   To represent the mLDP P2MP FEC uniquely with in the BIER domain there
   needs to be a BIER TREE Label (BTL). BTL in essence is mpls label
   that represents the P2MP LSP with in the BIER domain uniquely. There
   could be multiple methods used for assigning a BTL to a mLDP P2MP
   LSP, this is explained in upcoming sections.


3.1. Ingress BBR procedure
 


Bidgoli, et al.         Expires January 3, 2019                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      MLDP Stitching Through BIER Core        July 2, 2018


   IBBR will create LDP adjacency to all LDP routers attach to it toward
   the LDP domain.

   When a mLDP label mapping or withdraw arrives, the IBBR first
   determines whether the root of the FEC is reachable through the BIER
   domain. As an example, this root is located on a disjoint LDP domain
   that is reachable through the BIER domain. If so IBBR will forward
   the FEC to a BIER label assigning entity to allocated a BIER domain
   label (BTL) which would uniquely represent this P2MP FEC in the BIER
   domain. As it will be explained in upcoming sections this "BIER label
   assigning entity" could be an SDN controller or EBBR.

   On forwarding plane the IBBR will track all the LDP interfaces on the
   attach LDP domain which are signaling the same FEC. It creates a
   stitching point (ILM entry) between the assigned BTL and labels
   received via the label mapping message on LDP interfaces in LDP
   domain. This stitching could be a swap or pop and push. With the same
   token if a label withdraw arrives the IBBR will remove the stitch
   mapping and forward the FEC and the action to the "BIER label
   assigning entity" for appropriate action. 

3.2. Assigning the BIER sub-domain Tree Label

   There could be 2 methods for assigning a BTL. First via a SDN
   controller and second via the EBBR. In either method for scalability
   the BTL needs to be assigned from a label pool represented by EBBR
   prefixID and its BIER sub-domain <EBBR, SD>. 

3.2.1. Method 1: IBBR as extraction point to SDN controller

   In the first method IBBR will terminate the MDLP signaling from LDP
   domain. For label mapping/withdraw signaling packets, IBBR will
   extract the FEC and the action and forward it to the SDN Controller
   with its own BIER Prefix. The message format is <<IBBR,SD>, FEC,
   action>.

   The SDN Controller has the entire view of the end to end network or
   at minimum the view of the BIER domain network. BGP-LS could be used
   to build this network view. The controller will examine the FEC and
   find the EBBR closes to the root. The procedure to find the EBBR
   closest to the root is described in ietf-draft-bier-pim-signaling.
   After the SDN Controller determines the EBBR it will determine
   whether this is the first occurrence of this specific mLDP FEC, if so
   it will assign a BTL from the <EBBR, SD> pool to the FEC to uniquely
   represent the P2MP tree in the BIER domain.

   From this point on the SDN Controller keeps track of all new IBBRs
   which are interested in this P2MP FEC. The SDN Controller will create

Internet-Draft      MLDP Stitching Through BIER Core        July 2, 2018


   a mapping <<<EBBR, SD> (BTL), FEC, action>>, IBBRs>. The SDN
   Controller will update the relevant BBRs as described in the SDN
   Controller section.

3.2.2. Method 2, EBBR assigning the BTL

   Alternatively the IBBR can signal the <FEC, action> to EBBR via bier
   in-band signaling in BIER domain. This signaling could be a new BIER
   TLV or using the mLDP packet as a signaling packet, in par with
   draft-ietf-bier-pim-signaling.

   IBBR will use the ROOT of the mLDP FEC to find EBBR. The procedure to
   find EBBR is identical to ietf-draft-bier-pim-signaling. After
   identifying the EBBR, IBBR will encapsulate the mLDP signaling in a
   BIER packet with the correct EBBR bit set in the bier header and
   forward the signaling packet into the BIER sub-domain.

   The EBBR will examine the signaling packet and will allocate a BTL
   from its <EBBR, SD> pool. The EBBR then constructs <<<<EBBR, SD>
   (BTL), FEC, action>,IBBRs> mapping. EBBR needs to signal the
   <<<<EBBR, SD> (BTL), FEC> to the relevant IBBRs. This EBBR signaling
   can be done via SDN Controller or BGP, explained in upcoming
   sections.

3.2.2.1. BIER packet construction at IBBR for Method 2

   Assuming the mLDP packet is forwarded from IBBR to EBBR for
   signaling, the BIER header will be encoded with the BFR-id of the
   IBBR(with appropriate bit set in the bitstring) and the mLDP
   signaling packet is then encapsulated in the packet.

   BIERHeader.BitString= Bit corresponding to the BFR-ID of the EBBR

   BIERHeader.BFIR-id = BFR-Id of the BER originating the encapsulated
   LDP packet, i.e. the IBBR.

   Rest of the values in the BIER header are determined based on the
   network (MPLS/non-MPLS), capabilities (BSL), and network
   configuration.

3.2.2.2. Signaling mLDP through the BIER domain procedure 

   Throughout the BIER domain the BIER forwarding procedure is in par
   with RFC 8279. No BIER transit router will examine the BIER packet
   encapsulating the mLDP signaling packet. 

   The packet will be forwarded through the BIER domain until it reaches
   the BBR with matching BFR-ID as in the BIERHeader.Bitstring. This BBR
   (EBBR) will remove the BIER header and examine the mLDP signaling
   packet farther. 

3.3. SDN Controller procedure for updating BBRs with BTL

   The BBRs can use openflow message to send the mLDP FEC info to the
   SDN Controller. On the other direction the controller can use BGP SR-
   TE signaling (or pcep) to download the mapping information to the
   BBRs. Detail are outside the scope of this document but a new BGP SR-
   TE NRLI and TLVs would be needed.

   In either method the SDN Controller will track the <<<<<EBBR, SD>
   (BTL), FEC, action>, List of <IBBRs>> and download the <<EBBR, SD>
   (BTL), FEC, action> to the relevant BBRs.

   In method 1 the relevant BBRs are EBBR and the IBBRs that are
   interested in the P2MP LSP. It should be noted since in this method
   EBBR does not know about all the IBBRs which are interested in a mLDP
   FEC, as such the SDN Controller should download to EBBR the <<EBBR,
   SD> (BTL), FEC, action> mapping with the list of all interested
   IBBRs. In addition to this, every time an IBBR receives the mLDP FEC
   it should be signaled to SDN Controller via described method and
   added to the list. SDN Controller should update the EBBR with that
   info.

   In method 2 the EBBR has assigned this mapping and is aware of all
   IBBRs that are interested in the FEC. EBBR should signal the
   <<<<<EBBR, SD> (BTL), FEC, action>, List of <IBBRs>> to SDN
   Controller. SDN Controller downloads the mapping to only IBBRs that
   are interested in the P2MP lsp. As an example the list of <IBBRs>.
   EBBR will update the SDN controller with each arriving new IBBR that

   wants to join the P2MP LSP. The SDN controller will update these new
   IBBRs with the relevant mapping.


3.4. BGP procedure for signaling BTL for method 2

   As described in the "Method 2, EBBR assigning the BTL" section, BGP
   can be used to signal the <<EBBR, SD> (BTL), FEC> to IBBR. This
   signaling can be via MP-BGP MVPN address family with a new NLRI route
   type Intra-AS BTL Route

         +-----------------------------------+
         |          SD   (8 octets)          |
         +-----------------------------------+
         |        EBBR Router's IP Addr      |
         +-----------------------------------+

   The PMSI tunnel attribute can be used to signal the (BTL, FEC) to
   IBBRs. A new "BTL" tunnel type needs to be assigned. The PMSI TUNNEL
   ATTRIBUTE MPLS label field can be used to encoded BTL. The Tunnel
   Identifier will contain the FEC.

   In addition BGP SR-TE could be used, where the EBBR is generating the
   NRLI. As per SDN controller section this NLRI is a new NLRI, and the
   BTL will be part of the SID list (single SID). 

3.5. EBBR procedure method 

   After identifying the BTL for the P2MP FEC (via method 1 or method 2)
   EBBR will assign a up stream label for the FEC and signal it toward
   root via mLDP signaling.

   With same token the EBBR creates a multicast state with incoming
   interface as same interface that mLDP signaling packet was forwarded
   and outgoing interfaces of IBBRs BFIR-ids interested in the P2MP FEC.

   EBBR will stitch the upstream label to the downstream BTL with out
   going interfaces the IBBRs interested in this particular P2MP tree
   and identified via IBBRs BFIR-id. The EBBR will also build a BIER
   reverse path forwarding table, using the IBBR BFIR-id. This is
   explained in section 4.1.

   It should be noted EBBR will maintain LDP adjacency toward the LDP
   domain and all LDP routers which are connected to it. 

   At this point the end-to-end multicast traffic flow setup is
   complete.

3.6. Label release

   Assuming label release is originated from a disjoint LDP domain, the
   EBBR needs to signal the release of BTL to all IBBRs interested in
   this particular mLDP FEC. Also the EBBR will remove the ILM entry for
   this FEC base on the label release. 

3.6.1 Label release in method 1

   In method 1 the EBBR can signal the label release to the SDN
   Controller <<<<<EBBR, SD> (BTL), FEC, action>, the SDN Controller
   will find the list of IBBRs interested in this FEC and will update
   them accordingly. The IBBR will in addition send a label release to
   all mLDP neighbors on LDP domain that were signaling this FEC. The
   EBBR and IBBR will remove the ILM entry for this FEC and the SDN
   Controller will remove the entry and release the BTL for this FEC as
   well.

3.6.2 Label release in method 2

   In method 2 the same procedure as method 1 can be followed when the
   SDN Controller is used for signaling. In case of BGP signaling of
   BTL, EBBR will automatically withdraw the BTL route.

4. Datapath Forwarding

4.1. BFIR tracking of FEC

   As explained before the BFIR has a ILM entry which stitches arriving
   P2MP label to the BIER sub-domain Tree Label.

   The BFIR (EBBR) also track all the interested BFERs via arriving
   binding <<<EBBR, SD> (BTL), FEC, action>>, list of (IBBRs)> from SDN
   Controller (method 1)or the FEC signaling in (method 2). BFIR should
   build its multicast tree with incoming interface (IIF) as LDP
   interface (in LDP domain) and out going interfaces OIFs set as the
   <SD, BFR-IDs> of the interested BFERs (in BIER Domain). 

4.2. Datapath traffic flow

   On BFIR when the MPLS label for P2MP LSP arrives a lookup in ILM
   table is done. Base on the arriving label BFIR will find the
   stitching forwarding entry. BFIR will swap the incoming MPLS label
   with the assigned BTL. The swap action can also be a pop of mpls
   domain label and push of the BTL. BFIR will go through all the BTL's
   out going interface, (i.e. the IBBRs BFIF-id interested in this P2MP
   lsp). BFIR will put the corresponding BIER header with bit index set
   for all IBBRs interested in this P2MP LSP. BFIR will set the

   BIERHeader.Proto = MPLS and will forward the BIER packet into BIER
   domain.

   In the BIER domain normal BIER forwarding procedure will be done, as
   per RFC 8279

   The IBBRs will receive the BIER packet, will look at the protocol of
   BIER header (MPLS) and find the EBBR label pool base on the arriving
   packet BFR-ID and its sub-domain. BFER will remove the BIER header
   and will do a lookup in the <EBBR, SD> ILM for BTL. The BTL entry
   could be swap to the MPLS domain P2MP label or a pop of BST and push
   of MPLS domain P2MP. The MPLS domain will forward the packet as per
   MPLS forwarding procedure to all the MPLS OIFs on the IBBR.


5. Recursive FEC

   The above procedures also will work with a mLDP recursive FEC. The
   root used to determine the EBBR is the outer root of the FEC. The
   entire recursive FEC needs to be preserve when it is sent from IBBR
   to EBBR via the controller or the inband BIER signaling.
