Abstract

   With the depletion of the IPv4 address space, large-scale SPs are now
   faced with the real option to deploy IPv6 in a timely manner.  In
   order to achieve smooth transition to IPv6, migration tools should be
   introduced for different deployment models.  Among different IPv6
   transition mechanisms, MAP-T is a stateless translation method which
   can directly translate IPv4 packet to IPv6 packet.  This document
   describes the challenges and requirements for large SP to deploy IPv6
   in operational network, the experimental results of MAP-T in our
   laboratory and the field trials in large SP operational network.

Internet-Draft         MAP-T Trial in ChinaTelecom             July 2015


1.  Introduction

   The dramatic growth of the Internet is accelerating the exhaustion of
   available IPv4 addressing pool.  It is widely accepted that IPv6 is
   the only real option on the table for the continued growth of the
   Internet.  However, IPv6 deployment is a huge systematic project and
   a lot of challenges will arise especially in large SP operational
   network.

1.1.  Major Motivation

   In order to achieve smooth transition to IPv6, migration tools should
   be introduced for different deployment models, among which MAP-T
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-t] is a stateless translation mechanism with
   good scalability.  This document describes the challenges and
   requirements for large SPs in IPv6 transition period.  Then, we
   introduce MAP-T experimental results in our laboratory and the field
   trials in large SP operational network.

1.2.  IPv4-as-a-Service Requirements

   In order to facilitate smooth IPv6 migration, some factors need to be
   taken into consideration especially for large SPs.  There are ten
   major requirements:

   1.   It should deploy in an incremental fashion and the overall
        transition process should be stable and operational.

   2.   It should largely reduce IPv4 public address consumption.

   3.   It should accelerate the deployment of IPv6, rather than just
        prolonging the lifecycle of IPv4 by introducing multiple layers
        of NAT.

   4.   There should be no perceived degradation of customer experience.
        As a result, IPv6 transition mechanisms should provide IPv4
        service continuity.

   5.   It should achieve scalability, simplicity and high availability,
        especially for large-scale SPs.

   6.   It should have user management and network management ability.

   7.   It should support user authentication, authorization and
        accounting as an essential part of operational network.

   8.   Most SPs need some kind of mechanisms to trace the origin of
        traffic in their networks.  This should also be available for

        IPv6 traffic.

   9.   It should have good throughput performance and massive
        concurrent session support.

   10.  It should maintain the deployment concepts and business models
        which have been proven and used with existing revenue generating
        IPv4 services.

2.  Architecture and Methodology

2.1.  Major Design Considerations

   The major objective listed in the following is to verify the
   functionality and performance of MAP-T:

   o  Verify how to deploy MAP-T in practical network.

   o  Verify what applications can be used in MAP-T.

   o  Verify what Operating Systems can be supported in MAP-T.

   o  Verify the effect of user experience with limited ports.

   o  Verify the performance of MAP-T.

2.2.  Regulatory Considerations

   The government requires server operators to detect the packet sender
   by source IP (and port) and therefore stateless address mapping
   technologies are preferred.  This will dramatically reduce the volume
   of material required to be held for logging compliance.

   In addition, the stateless translation technology is preferred, since
   IPv6 addresses in the IPv6 packets everywhere in the network contain
   both the IPv6 and IPv4 address information without the requirement of
   decapsulation.

2.3.  Security Considerations

   From operation point of view, single stack (IPv6-only) is easier for
   ensuring the security compared with the dual stack.

   The stateless mechanism can help for the trace-back and identifying
   the source addresses (and port).

   The translation mechanism can help for configuring the access list
   and rate-limiting control without decapsulation.

2.4.  Operational Considerations

   The MAP-T deployment should support the DHCPv6-PD and MAP-T parameter
   auto-configuration [I-D.ietf-softwire-map-dhcp], the PPPoE
   authentication and source address tracing back.

2.5.  End-User Experience Considerations

   The major issues are:

   o  Application test: The applications we have tested include web,
      email, Instant Message, ftp, telnet, SSH, video, Video Camera,
      P2P, online game, Voip, VPN and so on.

   o  Operating System test: The OS we have tested includes Win7/8, OSX,
      windows XP, iOS, Android, and Linux.

   o  Performance test: We have measured the parameters of concurrent
      session number, throughput performance.

4.  Observations and Experiences

4.1.  Effects on End-User

   o  MAP-T can support all IPv4 applications, sam as NAT44.

   o  MAP-T can support a variety of Operating Systems.

   o  With the ratio of 128 (512 maximum concurrent sessions), there is
      no perceived degradation of customer experience.

4.2.  Effects on Internal Staff

   o  MAP-T can have good scalability.  MAP-T BR does not need to
      maintain any session state, and only limited session states have
      to been maintained in CE for its customer.

   o  MAP-T can be deployed in an incremental way.

   o  MAP-T supports DHCPv6-PD and PPPoE user authentication and the
      function of the source address trace back.

4.3.  Effects on Business

   address more effectively..

5.  Summary: Post-mortem Report

   MAP-T is a useful tool for IPv6 transition for large scale SPs.
