Abstract

   This draft defines an extension to RFC 3680 [1] for representing the
   GRUU associated with a Contact.

1.  Introduction

   The addition of GRUU (Globally Routable Unique URI) support to the
   REGISTER message, defined in [2], introduces another element of state
   to the registrar.  Subscribers to the registration event package [1]

Internet-Draft          Reg Event GRUU Extension            October 2004


   will sometimes have need for the new state.

   For example, the Welcome Notices example in [1] will only operate
   correctly if the contact address in the reg event notification is
   reachable by the sender of the welcome notice.  When the registering
   device is using the gruu extension, it is likely that the registered
   contact address will not be globally addressable, and the gruu should
   be used as the target address for the MESSAGE.

   The reg event package has provision for including extension elements
   within the <contact> element.  This document defines a new element
   that may be used in that context to deliver the GRUU corresponding to
   the contact.

2.  Description

   A new element (<gruu>) is defined which contains a GRUU.

   This optional element is included within the body of a NOTIFY for the
   "reg" event package when a GRUU is associated with the contact.  The
   contact URI and the GRUU are then both available to the watcher.

3.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   Unchanged from RFC 3680 [1].

4.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests

   A notifier for the "reg" event package [1] SHOULD include the <gruu>
   element when a contact has an Instance ID and a GRUU is associated
   with the combination of the AOR and the Instance ID.  When present,
   the <gruu> element MUST be be positioned as an instance of the <any>
   element within the <contact> element.

5.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   When a subscriber receives a "reg" event notification [1] with a
   <contact> containing a <gruu>, it SHOULD use the gruu in preference
   to the corresponding <uri> when sending SIP requests to the contact.

   Subscribers that are unaware of this extension will, as required by
   [1], ignore the <gruu> element.

6.  Sample reginfo Document

   The following is an example registration information document
   including the new element:

              xmlns:gr="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruu"
              xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
              version="0" state="full">
            <registration aor="sip:user@example.com" id="as9"
                 state="active">
              <contact id="76" state="active" event="registered"
                 duration-registered="7322"
                 q="0.8">
                   <uri>sip:user@192.0.2.1</uri>
                   <unknown-param name="+sip.instance">
                      "<urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6>"
                   </unknown-param>
                   <gr:gruu>sip:hha9s8d=-999a@example.com</gruu>
              </contact>
            </registration>
          </reginfo>


7.  Example: Welcome Notice

   Consider the Welcome Notices example in [1].  When the application
   server receives a notification of a new registration containing the
   reginfo shown in Section 6 it should address messages using the
   contained GRUU as follows:

      MESSAGE sip:hha9s8d=-999a@example.com SIP/2.0
      To: <sip:hha9s8d=-999a@example.com>
      From: "SIPland Notifier" <sip:notifier@example.com>
      Content-Type: text/plain
      Content-Length: ...

      Welcome to SIPland!
      Blah, blah, blah.


8.  XML Schema Definition

   A gruu document is an XML document that MUST be well-formed and
   SHOULD be valid.  Gruu documents MUST be based on XML 1.0 and MUST be
   encoded using UTF-8.  This specification makes use of XML namespaces
   for identifying gruu documents.  The namespace URI for elements
   defined for this purpose is a URN, using the namespace identifier
   'ietf'.  This URN is:
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruu

     <xs:element name="gruu" type="xs:anyURI"/>
   </xs:schema>


9.  IANA Considerations

   This section registers a new XML namespace, as per the guidelines in
   [3].

   URI: The URI for this namespace is
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruu

   Registrant Contact: TBD

   XML: TBD

10.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the registration event package is
   discussed in RFC 3680 [1], and those considerations apply here.

   The addition of gruu information does not impact security negatively
   because the gruu is less sensitive than the contact URI itself.

   The author would like to thank Jonathan Rosenberg for encouraging
