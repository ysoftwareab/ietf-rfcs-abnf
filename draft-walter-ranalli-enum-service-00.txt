Abstract

   This document describes a set of ENUM resolution protocols and
   services that enable communication applications to unambiguously
   differentiate between multiple communication services associated
   with a single E.164 telephone number.

2. Introduction

   The ENUM protocol described in RFC 2916 [3] utilizes the Domain Name
   System (DNS) [4] to provide for the translation of E.164 domain names
   into protocol and service specific uniform resource identifiers or
   URI's [5].  ENUM enabled applications are responsible for determining
   if the results of an ENUM query contain protocol and service specific
   URI's that are relevant to the applications purpose. This is achieved
   by examining the resolution protocol and service(s) contained in the
   service field of the returned NAPTR resource records [6].

   RFC 2916 defines a single resolution service named "E.164 to URI"
   (E2U).  The E2U resolution service indicates to an application that

   the result of processing the NAPTR record is one or more URIs, but
   does not indicate the specific service associated with the URI(s).
   The application must infer the nature of the service by examining
   the resolution protocol, however this is ambiguous when there is
   more than one NAPTR RR containing the same resolution protocol.  A
   simple example of this is when both a SIP based telephony service
   and a SIP based instant messaging service exist for the same
   telephone number.
 
   The example below highlights the ambiguity created by multiple NAPTR 
   RRs with a common resolution protocol.  In this scenario, an 
   application cannot discern the SIP-based "telephony" service from
   the SIP-based "instant messaging" service.  Similarly, an application
   cannot discern the SMTP-based "email" service from the SMTP-based
   "voicemail" service.

   4.3.2.1.6.7.9.8.6.4
       IN NAPTR 0 0 "u" "sip+E2U" "!^.*$!sip:4689761234@tele.fr!" .
       IN NAPTR 0 0 "u" "sip+E2U" "!^.*$!sip:pierre33@msn.com!" .
       IN NAPTR 0 0 "u" "smtp+E2U" "!^.*$!mailto:4689761234@tele.fr!" .
       IN NAPTR 0 0 "u" "smtp+E2U" "!^.*$!mailto:pierre33@hotmail.com!".

   Well defined, standardized resolution protocols and services are
   needed to enable communication applications to unambiguously
   differentiate between multiple services.

   There are many potential resolution protocol and services that may
   be associated with an E.164 telephone number.  In order to facilitate
   the deployment of communications applications that work across
   multiple service provider and technology vendor environments, care
   must be taken to only specify resolution protocols and services for
   which there is wide acceptance.  This document specifies an initial
   set of resolution protocols and services for telephony, electronic
   mail, voice messaging, instant messaging and presence applications.


3. Resolution Protocols

   The following ENUM resolution protocols MUST be used to identify the
   protocol associated with one or more of the resolution services
   defined in section 4.

3.1 Specification of Resolution Protocol - SIP

   This resolution protocol identifies that the resulting service uses
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [7].

   * Name:  SIP - Session Initiation Protocol
   * Mnemonic:  SIP

3.2 Specification of Resolution Protocol - H323

   This resolution protocol identifies that the resulting service uses
   H.323 protocols (H323) [8].

   * Name:  H.323 - IP Telephony Protocol(s)
   * Mnemonic:  H323

3.3 Specification of Resolution Protocol - SMTP

   This resolution protocol identifies that the resulting service uses
   Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [9].

   * Name:  SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
   * Mnemonic:  SMTP


4. Resolution Services

   The following ENUM resolution services MUST be used to identify the
   services associated with an E.164 telephone number and URI.

4.1 Specification of Service - E2TEL

   This resolution service identifies the primary telephony service
   associated with an E.164 number.

   * Name:  E.164 to Telephony Service URI
   * Mnemonic:  E2TEL

4.2 Specification of Service - E2EM

   * Name:  E.164 to Electronic Mail URI
   * Mnemonic:  E2EM

4.3 Specification of Service - E2VM

   * Name:  E.164 to Voice Messaging URI
   * Mnemonic:  E2VM

4.4 Specification of Service - E2IM

   * Name:  E.164 to Instant Messaging URI
   * Mnemonic:  E2IM

4.5 Specification of Service - E2PRES

   * Name:  E.164 to Presence URI
   * Mnemonic:  E2PRES

5. Examples

   The following examples illustrate how specific resolution protocols
   and services MAY be utilized to differentiate between applications
   that use common protocols.

5.1 SIP-based Telephony and Instant Messaging Services

   4.3.2.1.6.7.9.8.6.4
    IN NAPTR 0 0 "u" "sip+E2TEL" "!^.*$!sip:4689761234@tele.fr!" .
    IN NAPTR 0 0 "u" "sip+E2IM" "!^.*$!sip:pierre33@msn.com!" .

5.2 SMTP-based E-Mail and Voice Messaging Services
   
   2.1.2.1.5.5.5.9.7.2.1
    IN NAPTR 0 0 "u" "smtp+E2EM" "!^.*$!mailto:henry@mail.us!" .
    IN NAPTR 0 0 "u" "smtp+E2VM" "!^.*$!mailto:hsmith@company.com!" .

5.3 SIP-based Telephony and Instant Messaging Services Sharing a URI

   The following example illustrates two communications services
   associated with one E.164 telephone number, protocol and URI.

   4.3.2.1.6.7.9.8.6.4
    IN NAPTR 0 0 "u" "sip+E2TEL+E2IM" "!^.*$!sip:pierre33@msn.com!" .

   Note:  The service field of the NAPTR is limited to 32 bytes.  This
   should be sufficient as long as the single URI is associated
   with relatively few services.  A less compact implementation of
   this example would be:

   4.3.2.1.6.7.9.8.6.4
    IN NAPTR 0 0 "u" "sip+E2TEL" "!^.*$!sip:pierre33@msn.com!" .
    IN NAPTR 0 0 "u" "sip+E2IM"  "!^.*$!sip:pierre33@msn.com!" .

6. Security Considerations

   The use of resolution protocols and services does not introduce any
   new security considerations.
