        1) There is no IP address.  Choose is really wrong, especially 
        because the response doesn't return an address 
        2) the m line is incorrect, it's not RTP 
             
        3) the a line has some sense, but it really would make more 
        sense to have this be a parameter defined in the al package. 
    
        Clearly, if you send SDP, you need a c and an m line, but using 
        IP is just wrong. 
         
 
 
        We can either make them parameters, and then SDP wouldn't be 
        used in most cases, or we can extend SDP to have a more sane c 
        and m line. 
         
        At the very least, the c line should specify a legal IP 
        address, and not choose.
