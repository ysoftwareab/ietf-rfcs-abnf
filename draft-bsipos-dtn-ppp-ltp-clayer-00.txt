1.  Introduction

   The Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) provides a reliable point-
   to-point datagram transfer function.  According to the original LTP
   motivation [RFC5325] the LTP is "designed to run directly over a
   data-link layer protocol" with UDP/DCCP framing as a secondary
   transport mode.  This document specifies the method of transporting
   LTP segments between two data link endpoints using the Point-to-Point
   Protocol (PPP).

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  LTP Over PPP

   In this use of LTP over PPP, each LTP segment acts as a service data
   unit (SDU) encapsulated within the PPP protocol data unit (PDU).
   This encapsulation imposes constraints on both layers as described
   below.  LTP segments encoded according to [RFC5326] SHALL be
   transported over PPP according to [RFC1661] with LTP identified as a
   Network Layer Protocol.

2.1.  PPP Requirements

   There is no need for any Network Control Protocol negotiation before
   using LTP-over-PPP.  A PPP connection MAY multiplex other Network
   Layer Protocols along with transport of LTP segments.

   PPP does not directly provide a link-level data integrity check, and
   LTP relies upon the lower layer to guarantee integrity each LTP
   segment (each segment either arrives in whole or is dropped).

   Specifically, the use of Frame Check Sequence (FCS) of [RFC1662]
   ensures the integrity of PPP PDUs.  Some form of data-link-level
   checksum SHALL be used to ensure the integrity of transported PDUs.
   Any received PDU which does not pass integrity check SHALL be dropped
   by the PPP engine.

   The use of LTP over PPP SHOULD NOT interfere with any existing PPP
   extensions.  The LTP header and/or data of the SDU MAY be compressed
   within the PPP PDU.

2.2.  LTP Requirements

   For simplicity, and to conform with the PPP tradition of one-PDU-one-
   SDU there is no multiple-segment packaing as allowed by LTP.  LTP
   Engines have wide latitude regarding segment sizing, but in this case
   the PPP layer provides guidance regarding maximum allowed size.  Each
   PPP PDU SHALL encapsulate exactly one LDP segment.  The LTP Engine
   SHALL be informed of a change in negotiated PPP Maximum Receive Unit
   (MRU) size to adapt its LTP segment Maximum Transmit Unit (MTU) size.
   Where possible, LTP Engines SHOULD split data into segments no
   shorter than the MTU size.

   The LTP segment structure encodes the size of each of its component
   elements, so any additional data following the last segment trailer
   is unused by the LTP Engine.  In some cases it is beneficial to
   guarantee exact-sized PDUs, which can be accomodated with PPP padding
   as defined here.  Each LTP segment sized less than the MTU MAY be
   appended with zero-valued octets up to the MTU size.  An LTP Engine
   SHOULD NOT read any SDU content beyond the end of its final segment
   trailer.

   The PPP data integrity checks are relatively weak, so a
   cryptographic-type integrity check at the LTP segment level improves
   robustness.  This check avoids cases where PPP checksum passes but
   the data really has been either corrupted or tampered with.
   Specifically, the LTP Authentication extension of [RFC5327] provides
   an authenticated integrity check.  Each LTP segment SHOULD contain an
   extension to verify the integrity of the data witin the segment.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA Registry for PPP [refs.IANA-PPP] must have its "PPP DLL
   Protocol Numbers" table updated to reflect a new Protocol Field value
   for LTP as a Network Layer Protocol.

4.  Security Considerations

   Both PPP and LTP define extensions for authentication,
   confidentiality, and data integrity.  This memo does require the use
   of some data link integrity check.  This memo does not require the
   use of authentication or confidentiality at either layer.

   Because LTP implements no congestion control mechanism, if the PPP
   link is shared betweeen LTP and other network protocols the LTP
   transport may cause denial-of-service to the other network protocols.
