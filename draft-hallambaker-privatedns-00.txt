Abstract

   This document describes Private DNS, a transport security mechanism 
   for the DNS protocol. The mechanism may be employed to secure 
   communication between a client and its resolver or between a resolver
   and an authoritative server.

   Service binding including key exchange is effected using the JSON 
   Service Connect (JCX) Protocol. DNS protocol messages are wrapped in 
   a new framing protocol.

Internet-Draft                Private DNS                       May 2014

1. Introduction.

   Recent events have required urgent consideration of privacy concerns 
   in Internet protocols. In particular the lack of confidentiality 
   controls in the DNS [RFC1035] protocol is of considerable concern.

   This document describes Private-DNS, a security enhancement for the 
   DNS protocol that meets the principal use cases and requirements set 
   out in [I-D.hallambaker-dnse]. This enhancement provides for 
   encryption and authentication of the DNS protocol messages. 

   Private-DNS makes use of the JSON Service Connect (JCX) Protocol [I-
   D.hallambaker-wsconnect] and introduces a new framing protocol.

1.1. Related Work

   The proposal approach compliments the integrity controls provided by 
   DNSSEC [RFC4033]. While both provide integrity controls, the controls
   provided by DNSSEC are based on digital signatures while this 
   proposal provides controls based on a Message Authentica Code 
   technique.

   Like the Omnibroker protocol [I-D.hallambaker-omnibroker], this 
   proposal is built on JCX [I-D.hallambaker-wsconnect] but offers a low
   level interface to the DNS protocol alone as opposed to a high level 
   interface to generalized discovery services. A client would use the 
   DNSE-JX interface in cases where retrieval of specific DNS resource 
   records is required. The OmniBroker protocol would be used in cases 
   where the client delegates the choice of discovery strategy to the 
   OmniBroker service.

1.2. Terminology

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, 
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this 
   document, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

1.3. Defined Terms

   [[These terms are deliberately left blank here or else we will spend 
   time wordsmithing the defined term definitions rather than looking at
   the protocol.]

      Authoritative DNS Server

      Caching Recursive Resolver

      DNS

      DNS Client

      Recursive Resolver

      Stub Resolver

2. Architecture

   PRIVATE-DNS has two parts

      *  Service Connection

      *  DNS message encapsulation

   In PRIVATE-DNS, the service connection is provided by the existing 
   [I-D.hallambaker-wsconnect] proposal. The DNS message encapsulation 
   is new and supports encryption and authentication of the DNS protocol
   messages. 

   To make use of PRIVATE-DNS a client first establishes a connection to
   a DNS server (resolver or authoritative) using the connection 
   protocol. Once a client has established a connection it MAY use it to
   make as many queries as desired until either the connection context 
   expires or is cancelled by the service.

   The Service Connection and Query Service MAY be operated on the same 
   host or on separate hosts. 

2.1. Service Connection

   The service connection mechanism is responsible for establishing a 
   connection context between a client and a service. The connection 
   context comprises:

      *  A security context (opaque identifier, key, algorithm choice) 
         between the client and the connection service

      *  One or more query host connection contexts, each 
         comprisingNetwork connection description (IP address, Port, 
         Protocol, transport)Security Context  (opaque identifier, key, 
         algorithm choice) between the client and the query host

   The PRIVATE-DNS proposal is designed on the assumption that Service 
   Connection transactions are relatively infrequent and thus the 
   efficiency of the Service Connection protocol is not a major concern.



Hallam-Baker               November 10, 2014                    [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                Private DNS                       May 2014

   Accordingly the Service Connection protocol is implemented as a 
   JSON/REST Web Service over HTTP. While of an efficient encoding (e.g.
   [I-D.hallambaker-jsonbcd] would permit a more efficient 
   implementation of the protocol using UDP, such an approach would be 
   vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks against the service unless 
   appropriate countermeasures were taken. For example use of a 'cookie'
   approach to prove the validity of the purported request source 
   address.

   A service connection MAY return a host connection set that includes 
   multiple protocol and/or transport options. This has the important 
   consequence that it allows new message formats or a transition to an 
   entirely new protocol to be effected by simply defining a new 
   identifier.

   A distinction is drawn between a connection to a service and a 
   connection to a host. A connection to a host is a relationship to a 
   specific instance of a service with a distinct IP address. A 
   connection to a service is a relationship to a set of hosts. This 
   distinction is an important one for Denial of Service mitigation. A 
   DNS service need not publish the same network connection description 
   to every client. This permits a service to mitigate DoS attacks by 
   filtering query requests by IP address, a strategy that is greatly 
   enhanced by the large address space of IPv6.

   Different configurations of the Service Connection service allow a 
   DNS service to meet different combinations of security requirements. 
   For example the Public Resolver described in [U-PUBLIC] would not 
   require authentication of the client to the service but this would be
   required for the Subscriber, Private and Hybrid Resolvers described 
   in [U-SUBSCRIBER], [U-PRIVATE] and [U-HYBRID].].

2.1.1. Example: Public Resolver

   Following the use case [[U-PUBLIC] described in [I-D.hallambaker-
   dnse], Alice buys a laptop for her personal use at home. To ensure 
   the privacy of her DNS connection she selects example.com, a public 
   resolver that provides DNS service without requiring any form of 
   subscription or registration.

   During the initial configuration process, the machine uses the local 
   DNS advertised in the DCHP configuration for the first and last time 
   for discovery of the Service Connection Service of example.com.

   Having discovered a Service Connection Service, the client requests a
   service provider for the PRIVATE-DNS service by establishing a TLS 
   connection to indicated server. The server returns a TLS Certificate 
   that meets the authentication criteria of the client. Once the TLS 
   connection is established, an anonymous client connection is 
   established.

2.2. Query Protocol Binding

   The Query Protocol Binding is designed to efficiently support the 
   following features:

      *  Encryption

      *  Prevent use in an Denial of Service attack.

      *  Authentication

      *  Multiple DNS queries and responses per PRIVATE-DNS Query [[*]

      *  Multiple packet responses [[*]






Hallam-Baker               November 10, 2014                   [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                Private DNS                       May 2014

   The features marked [[*] are not essential for the purpose of meeting
   the privacy requirements but considerably improve the efficiency and 
   flexibility of the DNS protocol. In particular the ability to make 
   multiple DNS queries in a single transaction over UDP transport 
   enables the use of novel discovery techniques without impact on 
   performance.

   While the privacy requirements may be met through use of encryption 
   alone, any encoding that does not provide authentication of requests 
   allows a service to be used as an attack vector in a denial of 
   service attack on third parties. 

   The Query Protocol Binding wraps the [RFC1035] message structure 
   rather than eliminating parts that are redundant. For example, the 
   Query Protocol Binding Transaction ID which has a minimum length of 
   128 bits supplements rather than replaces the DNS message transaction
   ID of 16 bytes. 

2.2.1. Message Binding.

   To ensure access to the DNS service in any network circumstance where
   the protocol is intentionally blocked, two message transports are 
   specified:

      UDP transport
         The prefered transport providing low latency service.

      HTTP Web Service

   In a typical network environment where a MTU of at least 1280 bytes 
   is supported, the UDP transport supports DNS request messages of at 
   least 1100 bytes and responses of at least 18000 bytes. 

   Both transport bindings are specified in [I-D.hallambaker-wsconnect].

2.2.2. Query Protocol Example

   Having established a connection to a Private-DNS service, the client 
   from the first example performs a DNS query:

   
   www.example.com ? A

2.2.2.1. Key Derrivation

   [TBS at the moment there is no key derrivation function specified and
   the same key is used for encryption and authentication. This is a 
   weak approach architecturally as a compromise of one algorithm puts 
   the other at risk and should be fixed. Rather than use k as the key 
   we should use MAC ("encrypt", k) and MAC ("decrypt", k) or something 
   similar. However doing that right requires consulting past RFCs to

   Note that in a real world example, the request SHOULD be padded to a 
   fixed value (e.g. 1100 bytes) to prevent traffic analysis disclosing 
   the message contents. for illustrative purposes, a mimimal padding is
   applied:

   The request has the transaction ID which doubles as the 
   initialization vector of the encryption algorithm and ticket 
   identifier prepended and the MAC value appended:

   The plaintext payload is the DNS response plus the MAC value of the 
   request. This response is small enough to fit into a single packet.

2.2.3. Authentication Conformance

   A Private-DNS server MUST authenticate queries. In the case that the 
   UDP binding is used, a server MUST NOT make any response should the 
   verification step fail. This requirement ensures that a Private-DNS 
   service cannot be used to attack other systems in a Denial of Service
   attack through use of packets with forged source addresses.






Hallam-Baker               November 10, 2014                   [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                Private DNS                       May 2014

   A service MAY provide an error response in the case that a request 
   using the Web Service binding fails as the TCP/IP connection startup 
   provides an adequate protection against source address forgery.

2.2.4. Handling Multiple Requests

   A Private-DNS service MUST accept requests that contain multiple 
   requests. Where multiple requests are presented, each request in the 
   transaction MUST have a unique DNS Transaction ID. 

   A Private-DNS service MAY limit the number of responses provided. 
   Responses to requests MAY be returned in any order.

3. Service Connection and Key Exchangee

   The Service Connection is established using [I-D.hallambaker-
   wsconnect]. The service identifiers for PRIVATE-DNS are as follows:

      Service Identifier
         PRIVATE-DNS

   Two host connection bindings are defined:

      UDP Binding
         The UDP binding described in [!I-D.hallambaker-wsconnect] is 
         the preferred host binding. The UDP binding allows most queries
         to be completed in a single round trip with no mandatory 
         delays. 

      HTTP Binding
         A HTTP binding is specified for use as a last resort in 
         situations where the UDP transport is not available.

3.1. UDP Binding

   The prefered host connection type is to use the message encapsulation
   format

      Protocol
         DNS

      Presentation
         PRIVATE-DNS-P

      Transport
         UDP

   Note that the omission of version numbers in the on-the-wire data 
   structures is intentional. Use of the message encapsulation requires 
   that the parties have previously established a host connection 
   comprising the network and security parameters required to 



Hallam-Baker               November 10, 2014                   [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                Private DNS                       May 2014

   communicate. The choice of message encapsulation including the 
   protocol version is defined in the host connection.

   In the DNS protocol requests and responses use the same message 
   structure. The encapsulation uses different structures for requests 
   and responses but the payload of each structure is a sequence of 
   [RFC1035] messages.

3.2. HTTP Binding

   Under certain network conditions attempts to reach the PRIVATE-DNS 
   service may fail due to constraints imposed by firewalls or through 
   attempted censorship. Under these conditions, HTTP [RFC2616] MAY be 
   used as an alternative transport as follows:

      Protocol
         DNS

      Presentation
         POST

      Content-Type
         application/private-dns-p

      Transport
         HTTP

   A PRIVATE-DNS service offered in this fashion MUST support HTTP/1.1 
   or higher. The transaction is performed as a POST request with the 
   MIME content type application/private-dns-p.p.

4. Security Considerationsns

   The broad security requirements for Private-DNS are set out in [I-
   D.hallambaker-dnse]. 

   In due course this section will explain which of the security 
   requirements is met and under which circumstances. 

4.1. Confidentialityty

4.2. Integrity

4.3. Access

5. IANA Considerations


6. Acnowledgements
