1.  Introduction

   Network coding schemes are inherent part of the satellite systems,
   since the challenging physical layer require specific robustness to
   guarantee an efficient usage of the expensive radio resource.
   Further exploiting these schemes is an opportunity for a better end
   user experience along with a better exploitation of the scarce
   resource.

   In this context, this memo aims at:

   o  summing up the current deployment of network coding schemes;

   o  identifying opportunities for further usage of network coding in
      satellite systems.

1.1.  Glossary

   The glossary of this memo is related to the network coding taxonomy
   document [I-D.irtf-nwcrg-network-coding-taxonomy].

   The glossary is extended as follows:

   o  XX: XX

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  A note on satellite topology

   The objective of this section of to provide a generic description of
   the components composing a generic satellite system and their
   interaction.  It provides a high level description of a multi-gateway
   satellite network.  Figure 1 shows a example of a multigateway
   satellite system.  It is worth pointing out that some functionnal
   blocks aggregate the traffic coming from multiple users, and thus are
   opportunity for including network coding.

3.  Status of network coding in actually deployed satellite systems

   Figure 2 presents the status of the network coding deployment in
   satellite systems.  The information is based on the taxonomy document
   [I-D.irtf-nwcrg-network-coding-taxonomy] and the notations are the
   following: End-to-End Coding (E2E), Network Coding (NC), Intra-Flow
   Coding (IntraF), Inter-Flow Coding (InterF), Single-Path Coding (SP)
   and Multi-Path Coding (MP).

   X1 embodies the source coding that could be used at application level
   for video streaming on a broadband access.  X2 embodies the physical
   layer that is applied on the PLFRAME to have an optimal usage of the
   satellite capacity.

4.  Opportunities for more network coding in satellite systems

   This section extends Section 3 by presenting the opportunities for
   more network coding in satellite systems.

   These opportunities are further detailed in Section 5 and listed in
   this section:

   o  (1) two way relay channel mode;

   o  (2) reliable multicast;

   o  (3) improving random access;

   o  (4) network coding and hybrid access;

   We propose to include some of the identified opportunities in the
   Figure 3.

   Figure 3: Opportunites for more network coding and satellite systems

   Opportunities for more network coding in SATCOM seems to be more
   relevant at the middle ware or at the communication layer levels.

5.  Deployability and related use cases

   This section details use-cases where the usage of network coding
   schemes could improve the overall system and the deployability of the
   opportunities that are provided in Section 4.

5.1.  Network coding and VNF

   Related to the foreseen virtualized network infrastructure, the
   network coding schemes could be proposed as VNF and their
   deployability enhanced.

5.2.  Network coding and PEP

   Related to the impact and integration of network coding in Proxy-
   Enhanced-Proxy RFC 3135 [RFC3135] architecture.  In particular how
   network coding can be integrated inside a PEP with QoS scheduler as
   defined, for instance, in RFC 5865 [RFC5865].
