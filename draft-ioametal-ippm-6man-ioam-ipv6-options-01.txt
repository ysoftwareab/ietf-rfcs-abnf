3.  In-situ OAM Metadata Transport in IPv6

   IOAM data is carried in IPv6 packets as Hop-by-Hop or Destination
   options.  One IPv6 Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options Type
   codepoint is assigned for IOAM.  Multiple options with the same
   Option Type MAY appear in the same Hop-by-Hop Options or Destination
   Options header, with varying content.  This mechanism of in-situ OAM
   in IPv6 is used to enhance diagnostics of IPv6 networks.  It
   complements other mechanisms proposed to enhance diagnostics of IPv6
   networks, such as the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics
   Destination Option described in [RFC8250].

   IPv6 Hop-by-Hop and Destination Option format for carrying in-situ
   OAM data fields:

Internet-Draft       In-situ OAM IPv6 encapsulation         October 2018


   Option Type:  8-bit identifier of the type of option.

   Opt Data Len:  8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Reserved and
      Option Data field of this option, in octets.

   Reserved:  8-bit field MUST be set to zero upon transmission and
      ignored upon reception.

   IOAM Type:  8-bit field as defined in section 7.2 in
      [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   Option Data:  Variable-length field.  Option-Type-specific data.

   In-situ OAM Options are inserted as Option data as follows:

   1.  Pre-allocated Tracing Option: The in-situ OAM Preallocated
       Tracing option defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is
       represented as a IPv6 option in hop by hop extension header:

       Option Type:  001xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Option Type.

   2.  Incremental Tracing Option: The in-situ OAM Incremental Tracing
       option defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as a
       IPv6 option in hop by hop extension header:

       Option Type:  001xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM Incremental Trace Option Type.

   3.  Proof of Transit Option: The in-situ OAM POT option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option in hop
       by hop extension header:

       Option Type:  001xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM POT Option Type.

   4.  Edge to Edge Option: The in-situ OAM E2E option defined in
       [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] is represented as a IPv6 option in IPv6
       option in destination options extension header:

       Option Type:  000xxxxx 8-bit identifier of the IOAM type of
          option. xxxxx=TBD.

       IOAM Type:  IOAM E2E Option Type.

   All the in-situ OAM IPv6 options defined here have alignment
   requirements.  Specifically, they all require 4n alignment.  This
   ensures that 4 octet fields specified in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data]
   such as transit delay are aligned at a multiple-of-4 offset from the
   start of the Hop-by-Hop Options header.  In addition, to maintain
   IPv6 extension header 8-octet alignment and avoid the need to add or
   remove padding at every hop, the Trace-Type for Incremental Tracing
   Option in IPv6 MUST be selected such that the IOAM node data length
   is a multiple of 8-octets.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the encapsulation of IOAM data fields in
   IPv6.  Security considerations of the specific IOAM data fields for
   each case (i.e., Trace, Proof of Transit, and E2E) are described in
   defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

   As this document describes new options for IPv6 , these are similar
   to the security considerations of [RFC8200] and the new weakness
   documented in [RFC8250].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This draft requests the following IPv6 Option Type assignments from
   the Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options sub-registry of
   Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Parameters.
