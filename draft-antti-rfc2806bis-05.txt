Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis                  June 18, 2002


Abstract

   This document is a revision of RFC 2806.

   This document specifies the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) scheme
   "tel" for specifying the address of a terminal in the phone network.
   The tel URI is service-independent and describes voice calls (phone
   calls, answering machines and voice messaging systems), facsimile
   (telefax) calls and data calls, for landline, ISDN and mobile
   subscribers.


1 Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

2 Introduction

   This document defines the URI scheme "tel" that contains telephone
   numbers. The telephone number can refer to terminals in the telephone
   network or the Internet, mobile and landline devices, voice, data and
   fax devices. The URI can refer to originators or targets of a
   telephone call.

   Telephone numbers as commonly understood actually comprise two
   related, but distinct concepts: as a canonical address-of-record and
   as a dial-string. We define the concepts below:

        Address-of-record: The telephone number is understood here as
             the canonical address-of-record, as they are handled by the
             signaling network. Generally, this means E.164 numbers, or
             numbers that can be trivially converted into them.
             Subscribers publish a phone number as a universal means of
             being reached.

        Dial string: "Dial strings" are the actual numbers, symbols and
             pauses entered by a user to place a phone call. A dial-
             string is consumed by one or more network entities, and
             understood in the context of the configuration of these
             entities. It is used to generate a telephone number so that
             a call can be routed. Dial-strings may require pre-pended
             digits to handle local PBXs, and they may include post-dial
             DTMF signaling that could control an IVR. Dial strings are
             beyond the scope of this document.




H. Schulzrinne/A. Vaha-Sipila                                 [Page 2]

Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis                  June 18, 2002


   To reach a telephone number from a particular terminal, the user of
   the terminal or the terminal itself has to know how to convert that
   telephone number into a dial string appropriate for that terminal.
   The telephone number itself does not convey what needs to be done for
   a particular terminal. Instructions may include dialing "9" before
   placing a call or prefixing a "00" to reach a number in a foreign
   country. Telephone numbers are also the normalized way that addresses
   are signaled in the PSTN.

   The notation for phone numbers is the same as in RFC 2303 [2] and RFC
   2304 [3]. However, the syntax differs since this document describes
   URIs whereas RFC 2303 and RFC 2304 specify electronic mail addresses.
   RFC 2303 and RFC 2304 use "/" to indicate parameters (qualifiers).
   Since URI use the forward slash to describe path hierarchy, the URI
   scheme described here uses the semicolon, in keeping with SIP URI
   conventions [4].

   There are at least two ways one can envision making a telephone
   connection. In the first approach, a URI contains the dial string,
   which is then passed to an entity that can reproduce the actions
   specified in the dial string, by sending DTMF digits, waiting for
   dial tone, pausing and generating post-dial DTMF digits after the
   callee picks up. Another approach has the URI specify the telephone
   number, which can be either globally unique or only be valid within a
   local context. A dialer application is aware of the local context,
   knowing, for example, whether special digits need to be dialed to
   seize an outside line, whether network, pulse or tone dialing is
   needed and what tones indicate call progress. The dialer then
   converts the telephone number into a dial string and performs the
   necessary signaling actions. The document below assumes the second
   model. The dialer does not have to be a user application as found in
   traditional desktop operating systems, but could well be part of an
   IP-to-PSTN gateway.

   The approach pursued here has the disadvantage that certain services,
   such as extensions on a PBX (when direct inward dialing is not used)
   or electronic banking, cannot be specified in a URI.

   The URI is used as a request URI in SIP [4] requests. The SIP
   specification also inherits the subscriber part of the syntax as part
   of the user element in the SIP URI. Other protocols may use this URI
   for both query-based and prefix-based applications.

   A "client" is defined as software that can parse one or more of the
   URIs defined in this document and possibly place a call to a remote
   entity.

3 URI Comparisons

Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis                  June 18, 2002


   URI comparisons are case-sensitive except that the scheme and
   parameter names are case-insensitive.

4 URI Syntax

   The URI is defined using the ABNF (augmented Backus-Naur form)
   described in RFC 2234 [5] and uses elements from the core definitions
   (Appendix A of RFC 2234).

   The syntax definition follows RFC 2396 [6], indicating the actual
   characters contained in the URI. Note that the reserved characters
   "+", ";", "=", and "?" MUST NOT be escaped if shown in the grammar
   definitions below as they are delimiters for the "tel" URI scheme.
   These reserved characters MUST be escaped if they appear in parameter
   values.

   Characters other than those in the "reserved" and "unsafe" sets (see
   RFC 2396 [6]) are equivalent to their "% HEX HEX" encoding.

   The "tel" URI has the following syntax:



        telephone-uri       =  "tel:" subscriber *param                       |
        subscriber          =  global-number / local-number                   |
        global-number       =  global-number-part [isdn-subaddress]           |
        global-number-part  =  "+" 1*phonedigit                               |
        local-number        =  local-number-part [isdn-subaddress]            |
                               [context]                                      |
        local-number-part   =  1*phonedigit                                   |
        isdn-subaddress     =  ";isub=" 1*uric                                |
        context             =  ";phone-context=" descriptor *("," descriptor) |
        descriptor          =  domainname / global-number-part                |
        domainname          =  *( domainlabel "." ) toplabel [ "." ]          |
        domainlabel         =  alphanum                                       |
                               / alphanum *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum        |
        toplabel            =  ALPHA / ALPHA *( alphanum / "-" ) alphanum     |
        param               =  ";" pname ["=" pvalue ]                        |
        pname               =  1*uric                                         |
        pvalue              =  *uric                                          |
        phonedigit          =  HEXDIG / visual-separator                      |
        visual-separator    =  "-" / "." / "(" / ")"                          |
        alphanum            =  ALPHA / DIGIT                                  |


5 Phone Numbers and Their Scope

5.1 Phone Numbers



H. Schulzrinne/A. Vaha-Sipila                                 [Page 4]

Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis                  June 18, 2002


   The <subscriber> part of the URI indicates the number. The phone
   number can be represented in either global (E.164) or local notation.
   All phone numbers MUST use the global form unless they cannot be
   represented as such. Numbers from private numbering plans, emergency
   ("911", "112") and some directory assistance numbers (e.g., "411")
   and other "service codes" (numbers of the form N11 in the United
   States) cannot be represented in global (E.164) form, and need to be
   represented as a local number with a context. Local numbers MUST be
   tagged with a phone-context.

   Implementations MUST NOT assume that telephone numbers have a
   maximum, minimum or fixed length, or that they always begin with a
   certain number.

5.1.1 Separators in Phone Numbers

   Phone numbers MAY contain visual separators. Visual separators
   (<visual-separator>) merely aid readability and MUST be ignored by
   the client.

   Even though ITU-T E.123 [7] recommends the use of space characters as
   visual separators in printed telephone numbers, tel URIs MUST NOT use
   spaces.

5.1.2 Alphabetic Characters

   In some countries, it is popular to write phone numbers using
   alphabetic characters which correspond to certain numbers on the
   telephone keypad.  The URI format does not support this notation
   since the mapping from alphabetic characters to digits is not
   completely uniform internationally, although there are standards
   [8,9] addressing this issue.

   Since called and calling terminal numbers (TNs) are encoded in BCD in
   ISUP, this allows for six additional values per digit, sometimes
   represented as the hexadecimal characters A through F. However, in
   accordance with E.164, they may not be included in global numbers.
   Their use in local numbers is not defined, but it not prohibited.

5.1.3 Global and Local Numbers

   Global (international) numbers are identified by the "+" character
   prefix. Global numbers MUST be composed with the country (CC) and
   national (NSN) numbers as specified in E.123 and E.164 [7,10].
   International numbers have the property of being unambiguous
   everywhere in the world and are RECOMMENDED.

   Local numbers only work within a certain geographical area or a



H. Schulzrinne/A. Vaha-Sipila                                 [Page 5]

Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis                  June 18, 2002


   certain part of the telephone network, e.g., a private branch
   exchange (PBX) or a particular country. URIs with local phone numbers
   should only appear in environments where all local entities can
   successfully set up the call by passing the number to the dialing
   software. Digits needed for accessing an outside line, for example,
   are not included in local numbers.

   The phone-context parameter can be used to unambiguously identify the  |
   local context where the local number is valid. The parameter value is  |
   defined by the "owner" of the local number.  The parameter can         |
   contain a list of contexts that enumerate all the contexts where this  |
   number is valid. It does NOT in any way indicate a prefix that turns   |
   the local number into a global (E.164) number. The phone-context       |
   provides a unique identifier that lets a client know whether it can    |
   interpret the local number or not. It has not other meaning or         |
   function.                                                              |

   There are two ways to label the context: via a global number prefix    |
   (e.g., "+33") and via a domain name, e.g., "houston.example.com". The  |
   choice between the two is left to the "owner" of the local number and  |
   is governed by whether there a global number prefix or domain name is  |
   a valid identifier for a particular local number.                      |


        The two label types were chosen so that in almost all        |
        cases, a local administrator can pick an identifier that is  |
        reasonably descriptive and does not require a new assigned   |
        number. It is up to the administrator to assign an           |
        appropriate identifier and to use it consistently. In many   |
        cases, an organization can choose many different             |
        identifiers.                                                 |

   The domain name does not have to resolve to any actual host, but MUST  |
   be under the administrative control of the entity managing the local   |
   phone context.                                                         |

   For example, ";phone-context=+1,+49" indicates that the number is      |
   valid in country codes 1 (North America) and 49 (Germany). For a       |
   local number valid within a PBX, the organization can choose any       |
   number under its control to identify the context. For example, a       |
   context consisting of any of the organization's global number may be   |
   suitable, or a substring that is completely occupied by the            |
   organization. For example, +49-6151-16 would be a suitable prefix for  |
   the TU Darmstadt, as it uses all numbers starting with those digits.   |

   The global number prefix does not imply that adding it to the number   |
   will generate a valid E.164 number. It might by coincidence, but this  |
   cannot be relied upon. (For example, "911" should be labeled with the  |



H. Schulzrinne/A. Vaha-Sipila                                 [Page 6]

Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis                  June 18, 2002


   context "+1", but "+1-911" is not a valid E.164 number.) As noted      |
   earlier, numbers can be represented as valid E.164 numbers SHOULD NOT  |
   be represented as local numbers plus phone-context.

5.2 ISDN Subaddresses

   A phone number MAY also contain an <isdn-subaddress> parameter which   |
   indicates an ISDN subaddress. This parameter is mandatory, i.e., a     |
   client MUST reject the URI if it cannot interpret ISDN subaddresses.   |

   ISDN subaddresses typically contain IA5 characters, but may contain    |
   any octet value.

5.3 Other Parameters

   Future extensions to this URI scheme may add other parameters
   (<param> in the ABNF). Such parameters can be either mandatory or
   optional. Mandatory parameters start with "m-". An implementation MAY
   ignore optional parameters. An implementation MUST NOT use the URI if
   it contains unknown mandatory parameters. The "m-" prefix cannot be
   added to parameters that were already registered (except to create a
   new, logically distinct parameter). The "phone-context" parameter in
   this document is mandatory.

   For example, <param> parameters can be used to store application-
   specific additional data about the phone number, its intended use, or
   any conversions that have been applied to the number.

   All new parameters MUST be registered with IANA.

6 Examples

        tel:+358-555-1234567

             This URI points to a phone number in Finland capable of
             receiving voice calls. The hyphens are included to make the
             number more human-readable; they separate country, area
             codes and subscriber number.

        tel:7042;phone-context=cs.columbia.edu

             The URI describes a local phone number valid within the
             context "cs.columbia.edu".

        tel:863-1234;phone-context=+1-914-784

             The URI describes a local phone number that is valid within
             a particular phone prefix. (The example approximates the

             IBM tie line numbering system.)

7 Rationale


7.1 Why Not Just Put Telephone Numbers in SIP URIs?                       |

   The "tel" URI describes a service, reaching a telephone number, that   |
   is independent of the means of doing so, be it via a SIP-to-PSTN       |
   gateway, a direct SIP call via ENUM translation, some other signaling  |
   protocols such as H.323 or a traditional circuit-switched call         |
   initiated on the client side via, say, TAPI. It is thus, in spirit,    |
   closer to the URN schemes that also leave the resolution to an         |
   external mechanism. The same "tel" URI may get translated to any       |
   number of other URIs in the process of setting up the call.

7.2 Why Not Distinguish Between Call Types?

   Signaling protocols such as SIP allow to negotiate the call type and
   parameters, making the very basic indication within the URL scheme
   moot.

7.3 Why "tel"?

   "Tel" was chosen since it is widely recognized none of the other
   suggestions appeared appropriate. "Callto" was discarded since URI
   schemes locate a resource and do not specify an action to be taken.
   "Telephone" and "phone" were considered too long and not as
   internationally recognized.

7.4 Do Not Confuse Numbers with How They Are Dialed

   As an example, the E.164 number "+123456789" will be dialed in many
   countries as 00123456789, where the leading "00" is a prefix for
   international calls. (In general, "+" in E.164 indicates that an
   international prefix is required.) Tel URIs MUST NOT contain the
   local dialing prefixes in numbers such as 00123456789, as the
   transformation back to an international number is not guaranteed to
   be correct or unique.

   If a client receives a "tel" URI containing a local number, it MUST
   make sure that it knows the context in which the local phone number
   is to be processed, or else the number MUST NOT be used. Equally, the
   originator of a "tel" URI must take into consideration that the
   recipient may have insufficient information about the phone number's
   context.

   When overlap signaling is used, devices which collect dial strings



H. Schulzrinne/A. Vaha-Sipila                                 [Page 8]

Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis                  June 18, 2002


   MUST construct a complete phone number before constructing the tel
   URI and including the URI in a network request. In other words, such
   devices must convert from overlap dialing to en bloc signaling.

8 Usage of Telephone URIs in HTML

   The number SHOULD be visible to the end user if it is conceivable
   that the user might not have a client which is able to use these
   URIs.


     Telephone: <a href="tel:+3585551234567">+358-555-1234567</a>



   On a public HTML page, the telephone number in the URI SHOULD always
   be in the international form, even if the text of the link uses some
   local format.


     Telephone: <a href="tel:+3585551234567">(0555) 1234567</a>



   or even


     For having RFCs read aloud, call
     <a href="tel:+1-555-438-3732">1-555-IETF-RFC</a>.



9 IANA Considerations

   "Tel" URI parameters (<param>) MUST be registered with IANA. Any
   parameter that should be considered as mandatory should be prefixed
   by "m-" as described in Section 5.3. Mandatory parameters must be
   described in an informational or standards-track RFC.

10 Security Considerations

   The security considerations parallel those for the mailto URL [11].

   A client SHOULD NOT place calls without the consent of its owner.
   Placing calls automatically without appropriate user confirmation may
   incur a number of risks, such as those described below.

        o Calls may incur costs.



H. Schulzrinne/A. Vaha-Sipila                                 [Page 9]

Internet Draft                 RFC2806bis                  June 18, 2002


        o The URI may be used to place malicious or annoying calls.

        o A call will take the user's phone line off-hook, thus
          preventing its use.

        o A call may reveal the user's, possibly unlisted, phone number
          to the remote host in the caller identification data, and may
          allow the attacker to correlate the client's phone number with
          other information such as the e-mail or IP address.

        o A call may use the same local number in different contexts, in
          which the number may have a different meaning.

11 Change History

11.1 Changes Since -04

        o ISDN subaddresses can contain any IA5 character or even binary
          data; represented now as "uric".

11.2 Changes Since -03

        o Clarified use of multiple contexts and how to express this, as
          a comma-separated list.

11.3 Changes Since -02

        o Clarifications and editorial fixes.

        o Now, mandatory parameters are labeled, to avoid making [12]
          obsolete.

11.4 Changes Since -01

   The draft has been greatly simplified to reflect parts that have
   actually been implemented.

        o Removed references to carrier selection.

        o Removed dial context.

        o Removed fax and modem URIs.

        o Removed post-dial strings.

        o Removed pause characters.

   The specification is backwards-compatible with RFC 2806.

        o Editorial changes and clarifications. The document has been
          shortened and reorganized. Most paragraphs have been rewritten
          to be more concise.

        o Syntax now conforms to RFC 2396 [6], in particular related to
          escaping.

12 Acknowledgments

   This document inherits a large amount of text from RFC 2806 [13].
   Flemming Andreasen, Francois Audet, Lawrence Conroy, Jon Peterson,
   Mike Pierce and James Yu provided extensive comments.
