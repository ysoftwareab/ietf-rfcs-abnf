Abstract 
   This memo provides a generalized framework for solution standards to 
   meet the requirements presented in draft-ietf-mboned-maccnt-req-
   04.txt, "Requirements for Accounting, Authentication and 
   Authorization in Well Managed IP Multicasting Services". In this 
   framework a user sends a request for multicast data to a network 
   service provider.  The network service provider selects the 
   appropriate content provider to which it then sends on the request 
   transparently in a way so that the network service provider and 
   content provider do not need to know the corresponding user id for 
   the same user in the other provider's domain.  The content provider 
   then responds with an indication of "success" or "failure" to the 
   network provider and in the case of "success", the network provider 
   may delivery the requested data to the user.  The network service 
   may base its decision to deliver such data to the user based on its 
   bandwidth management policy.  The framework is designed to be 
   flexible and extendible, so it will be possible to implement 
   partially enabled versions as well as fully enabled versions of the 
   model.  Also an additional entity may provide transit of requests 
   between network service providers and content providers, either 
   through relaying or tunneling. 
                                      
 
1. Introduction 
    
1.1 Purpose and Background 
    
   IP multicasting is designed to serve cases where a single source of 
   data content is to be concurrently streamed to multiple recipients.  
   In these types of cases, multicasting provides resource efficiencies 
    
    
    
   Hayashi, He, Satou, Ohta                                   [Page 2] 
    
   Internet Draft      draft-satou-rac-framework-01.txt    March 2006 
    
    
   (both for the overall network and the content server) relative to 
   unicasting.  These efficiencies are possible because of the 
   avoidance of unnecessary duplication of streams, video/audio 
   processing, etc. Multicasting also provides resource efficiencies 
   relative to IP broadcasting in that content data is only delivered 
   to end hosts which request it.   
 
   There are many real-life situations where IP multicasting is 
   selected as the technology used for concurrent content delivery of 
   identical content data to multiple end-hosts.   "Requirements for 
   Accounting, Authentication and Authorization in Well Managed IP 
   Multicasting Services", (draft-ietf-mboned-maccnt-req-04.txt, 
   hereafter MACCNT-REQ-draft) describes the requirements in CDN 
   services using IP multicast[1]. "Issues Related to Receiver Access 
   Control in the Current Multicast Protocols" (draft-ietf-mboned-rac-
   issues-02.txt, hereafter RAC-ISSUES-draft) discusses the 
   requirements and existing support for commercial, large-scale 
   content delivery[2].  The requirements are derived from: 
        - need for user tracking and billing capabilities 
        - need for network access control and/or content access control 
   to satisfy the requirements of the CP 
        - methods for sharing information between the network service 
   provider and content provider to make it possible to fulfill the 
   above two requirements. 
    
   Detailed requirements are presented in MACCNT-REQ-draft.   These 
   requirements include mechanisms for recording end-user requests and 
   provider responses for content-delivery, sharing user information 
   (possibly anonymously depending on the trust model) between content 
   provider and network service provider, and protecting resources 
   through the prevention of network and content access by unauthorized 
   users, as well as other AAA related requirements. 
     
   The purpose of this memo is to provide a generalized framework for  
   solution standards to meet these requirements. This framework is to 
   provide a basis for defining protocols, but definition of the actual 
   protocols is outside of the scope of this memo.

3. Issues in multicasting related to commercial and large-scale 
   implementations 
 
   This section lists issues related to receiver access control in 
   current multicasting protocols which are especially important to 
   commercial, large-scale multicasting.  More details concerning the 
   requirements related to these issues are provided in MACCNT-REQ-
   draft. References to that memo are provided as applicable below.

            |    CP                        | 
            |                              | 
            +------------------------------+ 
 
   For the sake of simplicity, the above diagram portrays a case where 
   there is a single NSP entity and a single CP entity.  Under the 
   framework it is possible for there to be multiple CPs connected to 
   the same NSP, at the same time it is possible for the same CP to be 
   connected to multiple NSP networks (e.g. network selection).  In 
   other words the relationship of NSP:CP can be described as  1:1, 1:N 
   or M:N.  Furthermore it is possible that the NSP and CP could be the 
   same entity.   
 
   Description of Roles: 
    
   The user selects a CP and a NSP when the user requests content. NSP 
   may be automatically selected by a user terminal: e.g. a fixed line 
   NSP for STB or a mobile NSP for mobile phone. 
    
   The CP is responsible for Authentication and Authorization of users' 
   access to content that the CP manages. The CP hopes to collect 
   accounting information related to the access of their content. 
 
   The NSP is responsible for managing its network resources.  NSP may 
   perform admission control to protect bandwidth resource and needs 
   authorized information regarding user access for bandwidth 
   management. It is also responsible for confirming (authentication by 
   proxy) with the CP whether the user is eligible to receive content.  
    
   In addition to the three basic entities of user, NSP and CP, this 
   AAA framework for multicasting supports TP which transfers multicast
   stream from the CP to the NSP. 
 
 
3.2 Multiple User IDs 
    
   Users may be assigned separate user IDs for each subscription for 
   various NSPs and CPs.  When the user wants to access content or 
   otherwise use the network, the user registers the corresponding user 
    
    
    
   Hayashi, He, Satou, Ohta                                   [Page 5] 
    
   Internet Draft      draft-satou-rac-framework-01.txt    March 2006 
    
    
   ID with a request for content, etc: web authentication is one 
   possible method. 
    
   Terminal portability can be realized if the NSP authenticates a user 
   using a user ID. This allows the user to access the content from 
   various network access points. 
    
   Each CP may identify users by the user IDs that it has issued to 
   them. 
    
   The NSP and CP do not need to know the corresponding user id for the 
   same user in the other provider's domain, and it is not necessary 
   that there is a one to one relationship.  It is quite possible for 
   one person to hold multiple user ids for the same provider. 
 
 
3.3 Access Control and CP selection by NSP 
    
   When a NSP receives an access request from a user, it is necessary 
   for the NSP to determine to which CP the request is directed. It is 
   necessary for the NSP to ensure that it is not spoofed by an 
   inappropriate CP. 
 
 
3.4 Network Resource Management by NSP 
 
   After the NSP authorizes a user request, NSP may conduct admission 
   control based on NSP's bandwidth management policy. For example, if 
   the NSP manages the shared bandwidth of access lines, the NSP might 
   calculate available bandwidth and necessary bandwidth, and based on 
   these calculations determine to accept or reject the user request. 
    
    
3.5 Access Control and Distinguishing of Users by CP 
    
   The user ID and authentication information are forwarded 
   transparently by the NSP so that the CP can distinguish the user. As 
   the NSP forwards user's requests to the target CP, the CP can 
   authenticate and authorize the user's request. 
    
    
3.6 Multicast Session Management for Accounting 
    
   The NSP should not manage multicast states on a subnet basis, but on 
   a user basis because the NSP needs to notify start and stop times 
   for accounting purposes. This means that the NSP sends an indication 
   for Join and Leave on a user basis.

4. Network Connection Model and Functional Components 
    
   Section 3.1 introduces the high-level AAA framework for multicasting.  
   This section provides more detail on the network connection model 
   and constituent functional components.

4.1 Basic Connection Model 
    
                  +-------------+  
                  |     user    |  
                  |             |  
                  +-------------+  
                          ^ Access & Resource 
                          | Request 
                          v 
                  +-------------+  
                  |     NSP     |  
                  |             |  
                  +-------------+  
                          ^ Access     
                          | Request    
                          v            
                  +-------------+   
                  |     CP      |   
                  |             |   
                  +-------------+   
    
   First a user desiring authorization sends an Access request to an 
   NSP which then forwards it on to the appropriate CP for 
   Authentication and Authorization. The CP responds with either 
   "success" of "failure".  If "success" the NP may forward a success 
   response and stream multicast data to the user. 
    
   In this model the user selects the NSP to which to send its content 
   request.  Based on this request the NSP selects an appropriate CP to 
   which it forwards the request. The CP responds to the NSP's request:  
   it may not respond to another NSP in regards to the request. 
    
   In this model, as described in section 3.1, the relationship between 
   NSP and CP can be 1:1, 1:N or M:N.  Users may connect to multiple 
   networks, and networks have multiple users.

4.2 Transit Provision 
    
   The diagram below shows that a Transit Provider(hereafter, TP)  may 
   relay requests between NSPs and CPs.   
 
                  +-------------+  
                  |     user    |  
                  |             |  
                  +-------------+  
                          ^ Access & Resource 
                          | Request 
                          v 
                  +-------------+  
                  |     NSP     |  
                  |             |  
                  +-------------+  
                          ^ Access & Resource 
                          | Request 
                          v 
                  +-------------+  
                  |     TP      |  
                  |             |  
                  +-------------+ 
                          ^ Access     
                          | Request    
                          v            
                  +-------------+   
                  |     CP      |   
                  |             |   
                  +-------------+   
    
   For the sake of simplification the above diagram shows a 1-1 
   relationship between an NSP and a TP.  However it is also possible 
   for a single NSP to connect to multiple TPs, and a single TP to 
   multiple NSPs.   
    
   A single TP may connect to one or more CPs. Similarly just as a 
   single CP may connect to multiple NSPs (as described in the general 
   high-level framework, section 3.1), a single CP may connect to one 
   or more TPs.   
     
   A solution will include a mechanism through which the NSPs know 
   which TP(s) are to be used to communicate with which CP(s), and CPs 
   know which TP(s) to use for which NSP(s).  When a TP receives an 
   access or resource request from an NSP or CP, it must relay the 
   request to the correct CP or NSP, respectively.  Minimally, this 
   means that it must reconstruct the request with translated address 
   information.  In this model therefore a TP must understand the 
   format and meaning of the requests. 
    
    
    
    
   Hayashi, He, Satou, Ohta                                   [Page 9] 
    
   Internet Draft      draft-satou-rac-framework-01.txt    March 2006 
    
    
   There may be multiple TPs between a NSP and CP so that a TP is 
   actually receiving from and/or sending requests to another TP and 
   not directly from/to a NSP or CP. 
    
4.3 Transit with Tunnels 
    
   In addition to the above model of request relaying, a TP may 
   communicate requests through tunneling based on the contract between 
   the TP and the NSP and/or between the TP and the CP.  So in this 
   case the TP will not directly need to be process the contents of the 
   access and resource request (such as, header information), but 
   instead pass the request directly to the correct NSP or CP, using a 
   separate protocol to wrap the original requests. 
    
   Below is a diagram, representing how a TP can provider tunneling 
   between NSP(s) and CP(s). 
    
                  +-----------------+  
                  |     user        |

4.4 Constituent Logical Functional Components of the fully enabled AAA 
Framework 
    
   Section 3.1 introduces the high-level AAA framework for multicasting.  
   Below is a diagram of a fully enabled multicasting network with AAA, 
   including the logical components within the various entities. 
    
    
            +-------------------------------+ 
            |            user               | 
            |                               | 
            +-------------------------------+ 
                          ^

            +-------------------------------+ 
            |            NSP                | 
            |                               | 
            |+--------------+    +---------+| 
            ||NR Management |<-->|AAA Proxy||    (NR= network resource) 
            |+--------------+ RR +---------+|    (RR= resource request) 
            +-------------------------------+ 
                          ^ 
                          | Access request 
                          v 
            +------------------------------+ 
            |             CP               | 
            |                              | 
            |         +---------+          | 
            |         |   AAA   |          | 
            |         +---------+          | 
            +------------------------------+ 
    
   In the fully enabled model the NSP provides proxying of 
   authentication and authorization between the NSP and CP, as well as 
   user-based accounting.  The AAA proxy server of the NSP communicates 
   with the CP's AAA server.  In addition to direct proxying between a 
   NSP and CP-- although not show in the above diagram for the sake of 
   simplicity-- this proxying may be done through a TP.  This means 
   that the transit provider too is able to support AAA proxying.  
    
   In the fully enabled model the NSP also includes a component that 
   provides network resource management (e.g. QoS management), as 
   described in section 3.4, "Network Resource Management by NSP".  
   When a transit provider is used it may also provide Network Resource 
   management of its own resources.   
    
4.5 Modularity of the framework 
    
    
    
    
   Hayashi, He, Satou, Ohta                                  [Page 11]

   In the interest of flexibility, this framework is modular so that it 
   is possible that partially enabled versions of the models are 
   supported.  A AAA-enabled version provides AAA functionality without 
   Network Resource management.  A Network-Resource-Management-enabled 
   (QoS-enabled) version provides Network Resource management without 
   AAA functionality.  Similarly, the possibility of one or more layers 
   of transit provision between an NSP and CP is in the interest of 
   modularity and extendibility. 
    
    
5. IANA considerations 
    
   This memo does not raise any IANA consideration issues. 
    
    
6. Security considerations 
    
   Refer to section 3.3.  Also the user information related to 
   authentication with the CP should be protected in some way.  
   Otherwise, this memo does not raise any new security issues which 
   are not already existing in original protocols.  Enhancement of 
   multicast access control capabilities may enhance security 
   performance. 
    
    
7. Conclusion 
    
   This memo provides a generalized framework for solution standards to 
   meet the requirements presented in MACCNT-REQ-draft.  Further work 
   should be done to break down the content provider and network 
   service provider entities into their functional objects such as edge 
   devices, AAA servers, etc.
