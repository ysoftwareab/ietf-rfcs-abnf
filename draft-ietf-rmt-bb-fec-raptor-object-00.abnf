G=P/T.

N = 2^^n , where n is the smallest positive integer such that N*W
T = P/G whereif ceil(I/P') > 4096, then let G = 1.  Otherwise, let
G = 2^^j where j is the largest non-negative integer such that j
B = 4 MB and W = 256 KB


Q = 65521, the largest prime smaller than 2^^16
L = K+S+H
a = 1 + (floor(i/S) % (S-1))
b = i % S
b = (b + a) % S
b = (b + a) % S
b = (b + a) % L'
Q = 65521 is the largest prime smaller than 2^^16.
