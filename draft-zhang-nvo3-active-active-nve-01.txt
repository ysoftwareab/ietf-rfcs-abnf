                          Multi-homing of NVEs
               draft-zhang-nvo3-active-active-nve-01.txt

Abstract

   Multi-homing of NVEs is a desirable feature to NVO3 since it provides
   Tenant Systems with reliable connection, load-balance, etc. The major
   issue of the multi-homing of NVEs is that it introduces one-to-many
   mapping from Tenant System (inner) addresses to NVE (outer)
   addresses.

   This document identifies the requirements for multi-homing of NVEs
   and specifies corresponding solutions to meet these requirements. The
   key is to let remote NVEs be aware of the group of NVEs that are
   offering multi-homing to Tenant Systems, therefore the remote NVE can
   cope with the one-to-many mapping correctly.

INTERNET-DRAFT             Active-Active NVEs           October 16, 2015


1. Introduction

   At the edge of the NOV3 network, a Tenant System (TS) can be attached
   to multiple NVEs or a single NVE that uses more than one underlay IP
   addresses. For the latter case, a typical implementation is that a
   NVE is located within a physical server with multiple Network
   Interface Cards (NICs) while each NIC is assigned a unique underlay
   IP address. Both above cases are considered as multi-homing of NVEs
   from the tenant system's point of view [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch]. When
   this TS communicates with another TS attached to a remote NVE, this
   remote NVE will see one TS address being mapped to multiple NVE
   addresses.

   In this document, the support of one-to-many mapping is achieved by
   extending either the management plane or the control plane of NVO3.
   The NVEs offering multi-homing form an Active Active NVE (AANVE)
   group and this group is explicitly identified. The remote NVE
   recognizes the AANVE group and installs into the mapping table an
   one-to-one mapping while keeps the one-to-many mapping at the
   management plane or control plane.

   It's possible to extend the data plane to fix the one-to-many mapping
   issue. For example, an identifier of the AANVE group can be added to
   the NVO3 header. However, such an extension requires new hardware.
   This kind of solutions are interoperable with the solution defined in
   this document, but they are out the scope of this document.

   The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section 2 defines
   the Acronyms and Terminology that will be used in this document.
   Section 3 describes the two scenarios of the multi-homing of NVEs in
   NVO3 networks. Section 4 lists the requirements and specifies the
   corresponding solutions. Security Considerations, IANA Considerations
   and References are given in the rest sections.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Familiarity with [RFC7364], [RFC7365], [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch], [I-
   D.ietf-nvo3-dataplane-requirements] and [RFC7348] is assumed in this
   document.

3. Scenarios for Multi-Homing of NVEs

   According to [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch], for the multi-homing of NVEs, one
   or multiple NVEs use more than one underlay IP addresses to
   encapsulate frames from a specific attached Tenant System. For the
   return traffic, the TS can be reached via any of these IP addresses. 

   Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 detail the two scenarios of multi-homing
   of NVEs as defined in [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch]. A mixture of these two
   scenarios in a practical network is possible and allowable.

   In this scenario, the TS is connected to a single NVE. However, this
   NVE owns multiple underlay IP addresses and any of these IP addresses
   might be used, in an active-active way, for the TS. The multi-path of
   the underlay can be used to achieve load-balance. 

   The NVE can either be deployed on the TOR or co-located with the TS
   on a server. When the NVE is deployed on the TOR, the TS might be
   connected to a bridge which is in turn connected to the NVE using
   Link Aggregation; it might also be directly connected to the NVE with
   NIC teaming.

           Figure 3.2:  The TS is attached to multiple NVEs.

   In this scenario, the TS is attached to multiple NVEs which have
   their own underlay IP addresses. These NVEs work in an active-active
   mode for this TS.

   There is no reason to have the NVEs and the TS co-located on the same
   server, since there would be a better choice to implement multiple
 


Mingui Zhang, et al      Expires April 18, 2016                 [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT             Active-Active NVEs           October 16, 2015


   NVEs as a single one in that case. It would be normal to have these
   NVEs deployed on TORs and it's possible that these NVEs are deployed
   in a single TOR. The TS may directly use NIC teaming to connect to
   these NVEs. Also, it may be connected to a bridge and this bridge is
   connected to these NVEs using MC-LAG or DRNI [802.1AX].

4. Requirements and Solutions

   The key issue of multi-homing of NVEs is that it introduces one-to-
   many mapping. However, an one-to-many mapping does not have to be
   installed into the NVE address mapping table. Instead, this one-to-
   many mapping may be kept at the management plane or control plane. 

   Explicit identification of the multi-homing is the key to solve the
   one-to-many mapping issue. With this identification, remote NVEs are
   able to recognize the NVEs participating an AANVE. Only one of those
   multiple underlay IP addresses will be installed into the NVE address
   mapping table. 

   This section describes the requirements of the multi-homing of NVEs
   and specifies the corresponding solutions.

4.1. No Flip-Flop

   Since traffic from one TS may be observed, by a remote NVE, coming
   from more than one NVE addresses. It is REQUIRED that this NVE does
   not flip-flop among these NVE addresses. Otherwise, the TS will see
   packet disorder for the returning traffic. 

   The remote NVE maintains a per-VN table (data plane) of mappings from
   Tenant System (inner) addresses to NVE (outer) addresses (See Section
   4.2 of [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch]). It is REQUIRED that this remote NVE
   keeps in this table a unique outer address per inner address. 

   From the control plane or management plane [I-D.zhang-nvo3-yang-
   active-active-cfg], the remote NVE learns the set of NVE addresses in
   an AANVE. It locally selects one out of this address set to be kept
   in the mapping table. It is RECOMMENDED that the one with the least-
   cost path to the remote NVE is selected. 

   Note that the NVE address installed into the mapping table does not
   have to be equal to the one carried in the packet. Take the scenario
   in Section 3.2 as an example, even if NVE1 encapsulates the frame
   from TS1 and sends the packet to the remote NVE, the remote NVE may
   install NVE2's IP address into the mapping table. In that case, the
   return traffic will be sent to NVE2.

4.2. No Duplication
 


Mingui Zhang, et al      Expires April 18, 2016                 [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT             Active-Active NVEs           October 16, 2015


   No duplication will happen to packets ingressed by the AANVE and
   unicast packets egressed by AANVE. Nevertheless, if more than one
   NVEs out of the AANVE group egress a copy of a multicast packet, the
   TS will see packet duplication. Therefore, it is REQUIRED that a
   unique NVE is appointed as the multicast egress NVE. This unique
   multicast egress NVE can appointed by configuration as specified in
   [I-D.zhang-nvo3-yang-active-active-cfg], where the NVE with the
   highest priority is appointed. It can also be appointed according to
   a selection method agreed on by all NVEs of the AANVE group
   [802.1AX].

   The remote NVE may send serial unicast packets instead of multicast
   packets to each member of a multicast group. For this special case,
   the remote NVE MUST not send more than one copy to a AANVE group.

4.3. No Echo

   If a multicast packet is ingressed by one NVE out of an AANVE group,
   forwarded across the network, and then received by another NVE in the
   same group, it is important that the second NVE does not egress this
   packet. Otherwise, a forwarding loop will occur. Hence, the NVE in an
   AANVE group MUST NOT egress a multicast packet which ingressed by any
   other NVE in the same AANVE group.

   For the case that the NVE in an AANVE group uses serial unicast
   instead of multicast, there is not reason for this NVE to send a copy
   to another NVE in the same AANVE since the TS attached to the AANVE
   already has copy.

4.4. No Black-hole

   If an NVE senses that the VAP connecting to the TS fails as defined
   in Section 4.5 of [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch], this NVE MUST notify remote
   NVEs. Otherwise, packets to the TS which is attached to this NVE will
   be subject to loss (a.k.a. black-hole).

   The state of the AANVE group MUST be refreshed immediately and
   reflected in the configuration or a control message (See Section
   4.6). When the remote NVE obtains the new state of the AANVE group,
   it MUST update its local mapping table immediately. Usually this
   update means the withdraw of a batch of TS addresses.

4.5. Discovery of Multi-Homing NVEs 

   NVEs in an AANVE group SHOULD be either be discovered through
   configuration [I-D.zhang-nvo3-yang-active-active-cfg] or through
   exchanging of the control message specified as follows.

   o  a/w: Append or withdraw. The values of these two bits indicates
      the following actions on the MAC addresses given by the subsequent
      MAC-Reachability sub-TLV. 

      0 - null MAC addresses

         The MAC-Reachability sub-TLV in the AANVE Group State TLV MUST
         be ignored.   

      1 - listed MAC addresses withdraw 

         The MAC addresses listed by the MAC-Reachability sub-TLV MUST
         be withdrawn. 

      2 - append listed MAC addresses

         The MAC addresses listed by the MAC-Reachability sub-TLV SHOULD
         be installed to the mapping table by the receiving NVE.

      3 - withdraw all MAC addresses

         Within the interested VNIs listed by the Interested VNIs sub-
         TLV, all MAC addresses attached to the originating NVE MUST be
         withdrawn.

   o  MAC-Reachability sub-TLV: The AANVE Group State TLV value contains
   the MAC-Reachability TLV defined in [RFC6165] as a sub-TLV.

   o  Reserved: Flags reserved for future use. These MUST be sent as
   zero and ignored on receipt.

5. Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues.

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocated the IS-IS Application Identifier
   (tbd2) under the Generic Information TLV (#251) [RFC6823] for NVO3.
   Then, IANA is requested to assign a type (tbd1) under this NVO3
   GENINFO TLV for the NVO3 APPsub-TLV specified in Section 4.5.
