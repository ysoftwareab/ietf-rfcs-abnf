Abstract

   In a public WLAN hotspot, we need to have an easy and secure way to
   authenticate users. We have to find also mobility solutions, given 
   by providers, to perform well the roaming. A roaming mobile terminal
   MT may be within radio range of more than one access point AP.
   Therefore, we need to make an intelligent network selection decision
   after receiving some roaming information. Currently, the information
   is typically provisioned on the MTs as static roaming tables. But,
   this approach is not scalable when there is a large number of access
   points.

   In this draft, we propose our solution called OSFR, Optimized Network
   Selection for Fast Roaming to improve association speed and
   scalability.

1.  Introduction

   In a public WLAN hotspot, a roaming MT mobile terminal may be within 
   radio range of more than one access point (AP). Therefore, we need
   to make an intelligent network selection decision after receiving 
   some roaming information. Currently, the information is typically
   provisioned on the MTs as static roaming tables. But, this approach
   is not scalable when there are a large number of access points.
 
   In this draft, we propose our solution called OSFR, Optimized Network
   Selection for Fast Roaming to improve association speed and
   scalability. It consists in piggybacking the information in the 802.11
   Authentication Request/Response. The main advantage of our system is
   that we donÆt need to (re)associate each time with the new AP, rather
   associate only with the appropriate one which speeds up the connection
   procedure and results in a seamless handover.

1.1 Terminology 

   AAA

   Authentication ,Authorization and Accounting
	
   NAI

   Network Address Identifier [rfc2486bis].

   MT

   Mobile Terminal
	
   AP

   The new Access Point that MT wants to associate with.
	
   AAA Wlan Server

   It is the Local Wireless LAN Server which has a list of vWISP virtual 
   WISP that it has agreements with them.

   AAA Mediating Server

   The mediating Server that is localized in the path between AAA Wlan 
   Server and AAA Home server.

   AAA Home Server
 
   The server which provides service for mobile node (MT has an account 
   there).
	  
   For clarity, we will omit AAA from the terminology.
	
1.2 Applicability
 
   Our solution is really helpful in these cases described in [ARK04]:
 
   o  There is more than one available network attachment point, and
      the different points may have different characteristics.

   o  The user has multiple sets of credentials.  For instance, the user
      could have one set of credentials from a public service provider
      and another set from his company.

   o  Providers share the same infrastructure, such as wireless access
      points.

   The mobile terminal will need to associate with the right network,
   so that it can reach its home server. Especially, working in public
   places can causes high latency, especially, when the place is full
   of clients.

   One of the problem that all people hate is the cut of receiving
   services. If we can not avoid it, at least, we try to reduce this
   time needed for network discovery and selection.
 
2. Design

   One of the important characteristics of our solution is that we want
   to know the roaming information before getting associated with AP. We
   also need to send the information in a secure way because we work
   before the association and the channel isnÆt secure. Our idea is
   based on Diffie-Hellman Key exchange (D-H Key) [RFC2631] and optimized
   to use the 802.11 Management Frames [WIR03].

   First of all, in Beacon frame, we add the two parameters needed to 
   generate the D-H keys. Then, in Probe Request, MT sends its public key
   YMT and in Probe Response, AP sends its public key YAP. Now the two
   devices can send encrypted data with D-H keys. In IEEE 802.11
   specification, we have two kinds of authentication algorithm (Open
   System and Shared Key). In our solution, using one of the two will not
   cause problems because we only use Auth Request and Auth Response for
   Open System, Auth Request and Challenge Text for Shared Key.

Internet-Draft                OSFR                            July 2005


   We aim to add roaming information which consists essentially in the
   identity of the intermediary WISP needed for Network Selection. If MT
   finds the WISP that it can reach its Home Server, it will send the
   identity of this Mediating Server. In that case, we will use the path
   passing by this Mediating Server in EAP session. We choose to send the
   list of WISP in the body of Management frame because this method helps
   us to use the maximum length for information.

   In some solution like Adrangi, et all [ADR05], the length used will
   be less than 1020 bytes. But when we use Management Frame body the
   least possibility will be when we piggyback information after
   Challenge Text and it will be 2048 bytes.

   OSFR assumes also backward compatibility with devices that do not 
   support this technique. LetÆs give now more details about how OSFR
   performs.
 
3. Scenario
   
   In this scenario, we present all possible interactions between the
   actors. In the fellowing, we see all the message in OSFR scenario.

   AP sends Beacon to alert the users about its presence. In our 
   solution, AP is the one who chooses the parameters (prime number 'p'
   and base 'g') needed to generate the D-H keys. Here are all possible
   interactions in our scenario:

   1   When MT sends to AP a Probe Request, it piggybacks its public key
       YMT.
     
   2   AP sends Probe Response to MT and piggybacks its public key YAP.
       After exchanging the public keys, we can begin a secure session
       using D-H keys. Our modification will not depend on the type of 
       IEEE 802.11 Authentication.
     
   3   MT sends an Authentication Request including its identity 
       user@realm encrypted with D-H key.
     
   4   AP will send the identity in an EAP Request to WLAN Server. This
       later has a list of vWISP virtual WISP. WLAN Server will send the
       list to AP within an EAP Response.
 
 
   5   A can be the Authentication Response "Open System" or the
       Challenge Text "Shared Key". AP piggybacks the list (encrypted
       with D-H key). MT needs this list to choose the "right" Mediating
       Server to reach its Home Server. If we choose Open System, we pass
       directly to (re)association. Otherwise, if it is Shared Key, we
       continue to send the Challenge Response and Success Access.

   6   Now, all depends on the list received by MT:

       6a   MT doesnÆt find the right Mediating Server in the list sent
            by AP; it will not (re)associate with AP and will seek for
            another one. For example, MT wants a French WISP but in the
            list there is only American WISP.
         
       6b   In the other case, MT sends (re)Association Request and
            piggybacks the NAI of the Mediating Server encrypted with
            D-H key.
	     
   7   AP sends (re)Association response to MT.
  
   8   Now, EAP session can begin and we are sure that WLAN Server will
       reach the Home Server using a path including the chosen Mediating
       Server.

4. Packet Format

   In this section, we introduce all the changes that we need to do in
   the body of some Management Frames. The maximum size of the frame 
   body is 2312 bytes. We will add some new Information Elements that 
   have 3 fields:

       +---------------+----------+--------------------+
       | Element ID(1) |Length(1) | Information(length)|
       +---------------+----------+--------------------+

   We found in the IEEE 802.11 specification some reserved element ID
   (7-15, 32-255). We project to use some of this element ID to add our 
   new Information Elements. The length given between () is in bytes for
   all fields.

4.1 Beacon

   We piggyback the prime 'p' and base 'g'. The length of the parameters
   'p' and 'g' will be 1024 bits (128 bytes). In the IEEE 802.11
   specification, the maximum length free in Beacon frame body is 334 
   bytes. We just add after TIM (Traffic Indication Map) 2 new fields 
   one for parameter 'p' and the other for 'g'. The length of each field 
   is 128 bytes.

   P: Information Elements

       +-----------------+---------------+--------+
       | Element ID(1)=7 | Length(1)=128 | p(128) |
       +-----------------+---------------+--------+

   G: Information Elements

       +-----------------+---------------+--------+
       | Element ID(1)=8 | Length(1)=128 | g(128) |
       +-----------------+---------------+--------+

   The new beacon frame body seems like:

       +----------------------+--------+--------+
       | 802.11 Beacon Fields | P(130) | G(130) |
       +----------------------+--------+--------+
 
4.2 Probe Request

   In the probe request, we add the MTÆs public key YMT. The later will 
   be a new element information.

      +-----------------+---------------+--------+
      | Element ID(1)=9 | Length(1)=128 | y(128) |
      +-----------------+---------------+--------+

   The new Probe Request frame body seems like:

      +----------+---------------------+--------+
      | SSID(34) | Supported rates(10) | Y(128) |
      +----------+---------------------+--------+

4.3 Probe Response

   It is like Probe Request but source now is AP. We have the same 
   Information Element y (Element ID=9) called YAP. The new Probe Request
   frame body seems like:

      +------------------------------+--------+
      | 802.11 Probe Response Fields | Y(128) |
      +------------------------------+--------+

4.4 Authentication Request

   Identity is a string which identifies user (ex mail address, login). 
   The new Element Information contains the identity encrypted by D-H
   key. The max length of Identity will be 2304 bytes.

      +------------------+-----------+------------------+
      | Element ID(1)=10 | Length(1) | identity(Length) |
      +------------------+-----------+------------------+

Internet-Draft                OSFR                            July 2005


   The frame body will be:

      +---------------------------+---------------------+
      |802.11 Auth Request Fields | Identity(length +2) |
      +---------------------------+---------------------+
 
4.5 Authentication Response or Challenge Text

   We add a new Element Information called List (encrypted with D-H key).

      +------------------+-----------+--------------+
      | Element ID(1)=11 | Length(1) | list(Length) |
      +------------------+-----------+--------------+  

   1   If Authentication algorithm number equals 0 (Open System), the 
       frame body will be:
	
          +----------------------------+----------------+
          |802.11 Auth Response Fields |List(length +2) |
          +----------------------------+----------------+
				
       Here the maximum length of List is 2304 bytes.
		
   2   If Authentication algorithm number equals 1 (Shared Key), the 
       frame body will be:
	   
          +----------------------------+----------------+
          |802.11 Challenge Text Fields|List(length +2) |
          +----------------------------+----------------+
			
       Here the maximum length of List is 2048 bytes. The 2 next frames
       in Shared Key Authentication wonÆt be modified.
		
4.6 (Re)Association Request
 
   Here we will add the last new Information Element NAI. It is the 
   identifier of the Mediating Server (encrypted with D-H key). The 
   maximum possible length for NAI is 2262 bytes.

      +------------------+-----------+-------------+
      | Element ID(1)=12 | Length(1) | nai(Length) |
      +------------------+-----------+-------------+ 
 
   1   If we have Association Request, the frame body will be:
	
          +---------------------------------+----------------+
          |802.11 Association Request Fields|NAI(length +2)  |
          +---------------------------------+----------------+

   2   If we have Re-association Request, the frame body will be:
	
          +-----------------------------------+----------------+
          |802.11 Reassociation Request Fields|NAI(length +2)  |
          +-----------------------------------+----------------+
	  
   The final (re)Association response will not be changed.

5.  Security Considerations

   OSFR use Diffie Hellman to secure the exchange of encryted data in
   the management level. All the security in this system is provided by
   the secrecy of the private keying material. If either sender or 
   recipient private keys are disclosed, all messages sent or received 
   using that key are compromised. Similarly, loss of the private key
   results in an inability to read messages sent using that key [RFC 2631].
