            A Persistent Web IDentifier (PWID) URN Namespace
                    draft-pwid-urn-specification-01

Abstract

   This document specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Persistent
   Web IDentifiers to web material in web archives using the 'pwid'
   namespace identifier.  The purpose of the standard is to support
   general, global, sustainable, humanly readable, technology agnostic,
   persistent and precise web references for web materials.

   The PWID URN can assist in two ways: First, by providing potential
   resolvable precise and persistent reference scheme for documents,
   which is not sufficiently covered by existing web reference
   practices.  Second, by providing a standardized way to specify web
   elements in a web collection also known as web corpus.  Definitions
   of web collections are often needed for extraction of data used in
   production of research results, e.g. for evaluations in the future.
   Current practices today are not persistent as they often use some CDX
   version, which vary for different implementations.

1.  Introduction

   The purpose of the PWID URN is to represent general, global,
   sustainable, humanly readable, technology agnostic, persistent and
   precise web archive resource references - in a way that can be used
   for technical solutions.

   The motivation for defining a PWID namespace is the growing challenge
   of references to web resources, - both regarding referencing web
   resources from papers and regarding definition of web collection/
   corpus - calls for action now, which can be provided with PWID as a
   URN, allthough the prefixing with "urn:" is not ideal.  In deatail
   the challenges are:

   o  Citation guidelines generally do not cover general and persistent
      referencing techniques for web resources that are not registered
      by Persistent Identifier systems (like DOI [DOI]).  However, an
      increasing number of references point to resources that only exist
      on the web, e.g. blogs that turned out to have a historical
      impact.  In order to obtain persistency for a reference, the
      target need to be stable.  As the live web is 'alive' and in
      constant change, persistency can only be obtained by referring to

      archived snapshots of the web.  The PWID URN is therefore focused
      on referencing archived web material in a technology agnostic way
      (research documented in [IPRES] and [ResawRef]).

   o  There are many different requirements for construction of
      collection definitions for web material besides precision and
      persistency.  Recent research have found that various legal and
      sustainability issues leads to a need for a collection to be
      defined by references to the web parts in the collection.  The
      PWID URN is needed in such definitions in order to fulfil these
      requirements and to enable a collection to cover web materials
      from more archives (Research documented in and [ResawColl]).

   For the sake of usability and sustainability, the definition of the
   PWID URN is focused on only having the minimum required information
   to make a precise identification of a resource in an arbitrary web
   archive.  Resent research have found that this is obtain by the
   following information [ResawRef]:

   o  Identification of web archive

   o  Identification of source:

      *  Archived URI or identifier

      *  Archival timestamp

   o  Intended coverage (page, part, subsite etc.)

   The PWID URN represents this information in an unambiguous way, and
   thus enabling technical solutions to be defined in this URN.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Purpose:

      The purpose of the PWID URN is to represent general, global,
      sustainable, humanly readable, technology agnostic, persistent and
      precise web archive resource references - in a way that can be
      used for technical solutions.  The standard is needed to address
      web materials meeting precision and persistency issues on par
      precision in with traditional references for analogue material.

      The scope and applicability of the PWID URN is both references to
      archived web resources from literature as well as basis for
      defining parts of a archived web collection.  Strict unambiguous
      syntax is needed in order to ensure that it can be used for
      computational purposes.  This is relevant for web collection
      definitions, which will need a strict syntax in order to be a
      basis for automatic extraction.  Furthermore, readers of research
      papers are today expecting to be able to access a referenced
      resource by clicking an actionable URI, therefore a similar
      facility will be expected for references to available archived web
      material.

      The interest for this new PWID has already been shown, a paper
      about the invention of the PWID "Persistent Web References - Best
      Practices and New Suggestions" [IPRES] was accepted for the iPres
      2016 conference and nominated as best paper.  At the RESAW 2017
      conference there are two related papers: One on referencing
      practices [ResawRef] and one on research data management practices
      [ResawColl].  The interest for the PWID so far indicates that this
      is a recognized issue, and that the PWID can fill a gap.

      The PWID URN is to represent this information in a way that can be
      used for technical solutions, for example for resolving of a
      references and automatic extraction of web collection defined by

      PWID URNs [ResawRef] [ResawColl].  There may come different
      implementations for resolving which may rely on different
      protocols and application.  As a start there is work on a
      prototype that can work for the Danish Netarkiv data and open web
      archives with standard patterns for the current technologies.
      Further work will be done to make this more internationally
      integrated.

      The ambition is to make the PWID URN namespace definition a
      constituent part of a standard being developed in the IETF or some
      other recognized standards body.  The textual version of the PWID
      (see additional information) is already in draft of the revision
      of the ISO 690 reference standard.

   Syntax:

      The syntax of the PWID URN is specified below in Augmented Backus-
      Naur Form (ABNF) RFC 5234 [RFC5234] and it conforms to URN syntax
      defined in RFC 8141 [RFC8141].  The syntax definition of the PWID
      URN is:



                    pwid-urn  = = "urn" ":" pwid-NID ":" pwid-NSS



                 pwid-NID = "pwid"
                 pwid-NSS = archive-id ":" archival-time ":" coverage-spec
                 ":" archived-item



                    archive-id  = +( unreserved )



                 archival-time   = full-date datetime-delim full-pwid-time
                 datetime-delim  = "T"
                 full-pwid-time  = time-hour [":"] time-minute [":"] time-second "Z"



                 coverage-spec    = "part" / "page" / "subsite" / "site"
                 / "collection" / "recording" / "snapshot"
                 / "other"

                    archived-item = URI / archived-item-id
                    archived-item-id  = +( unreserved )

      where

      *  'unreserved' is defined as in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]

      *  'coverage-spec' values are not case sensitive (i.e.  "PAGE" /
         "PART" / "PaGe" / ... are valid values as well.)

      *  'archival-time' is a UTC timestamp conforming to the W3C
         profile ISO8601 ISO 8601 [ISO8601] (also defined in RFC 3339
         [RFC3339]), with a few exception.  It has to be a UTC timestamp
         in order to conform with web archiving practices, which always
         uses UTC in order to avoid confusions.  The 'full-date' is
         defined as in RFC 3339 [RFC3339].  The 'archival-time' must
         represent the time specified in the archive, and can therefore
         be specified at any of the levels of granularity as described
         in [W3CDTF] and in accordance with teh WARC standard ISO 28500
         [ISO28500].

         In line with RFC 3339 [RFC3339] the "T" may alternatively be
         lower case "t".

         'time-hour', 'time-minute' and 'time-second' are defined as in
         RFC 3339 [RFC3339].

         In line with RFC 3339 [RFC3339] the "Z" may alternatively be
         lower case "z".

      *  'URI' is defined as in RFC 3986 [RFC3986]

      The 'coverage-spec' defines the type of archived item, serving as
      a precision to what is referred:

      *  part
         the single archived element, e.g. a pdf, a html text, an image

      *  page
         the full context as a page, e.g. a html page with referred
         images

      *  subsite
         the full context as a subsite within its domain, e.g. a
         document represented in a web structure

      *  site
         the full context as a site within its domain

Internet-DraftA Persistent Web IDentifier (PWID) URN NamespDecember 2017


      *  collection
         a collection/corpora definition, e.g. defined as descibed in
         [ResawColl]

      *  snapshot
         a snapshot (image) representation of web material, e.g. a web
         page

      *  recording
         a recording of a web browsing

      *  other
         if something else

      Note that the 'coverage-spec' is a parameter that could have been
      specified as a query.  However, since the 'pwid-urn' can include
      an URI as 'archived-item', it would introduce ambiguities if the
      'coverage-spec' was specified as a query, since it would not be
      clear whether the query belonged to the 'pwid-urn' or the
      'archived-item'.

   Assignment:

      There are no authorities for assigning PWID URNs to resources, as
      the rule is the it is the given by the syntax that the name is
      assigned according to the

      *  Identification of web archive

      *  Identification of source:

         +  Archived URI or identifier

         +  Archival timestamp

      *  Intended coverage (page, part, subsite etc.)

      Therefore, the PWID URNs are created independently, but following
      an algorithm that itself guarantees uniqueness.

      The name will always be unique, as the only way to define a clash
      would be that a web archive cease to exist, and by time another
      web archive gets the same name space and have resources with the
      same name and same archiving timestamp, but with different
      contents.  This is a highly unlikely scenario.

   Security and Privacy:




Zierau                    Expires June 10, 2018                 [Page 7]

Internet-DraftA Persistent Web IDentifier (PWID) URN NamespDecember 2017


      Security and privacy considerations are restricted to accessible
      web resources in web archives.  If resolvers to PWID URNs are
      created, there should be made an analysis of whether they can be
      restricted to the former mentioned registry of web archives.
      Security and privacy will then be a question of security and
      privacy considerations related to the web archive resources.

   Interoperability:

      This is covered by comments in the Syntax description, where the
      'archival-time' conforms to the W3C profile ISO 8601 [ISO8601]
      (also defined in RFC 3339 [RFC3339]) and use of date conforms to
      the WARC standard ISO 28500 [ISO28500] using UTC dates only.
      Furthermore, the when the 'archived-item' is a URI, this conforms
      to the URI standard defined as in RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

   Resolution:

      The information in a PWID URN can be used for locating a web
      archive resource, for any kind of web archive.  It includes the
      minimum information for web archive materials, which enables
      resolvability, manually or by a resolver.  The plan is to develop
      a resolving service, but this is only in a prototype form at the
      moment.

      Resolution of a PWID URN is the primary motivation of making a
      formal URN definition, instead of just textual representation of
      the for needed parts of a PWID:

      *  Web archive identification
         to find the archive holding the material

      *  Archived URI or identifier of item
         as part of identifying the material

      *  Date and time associated with the archived URI/item
         as part of precise identification of the material

      *  Coverage of what is referred
         as part of clarification of what the referred material covers
         (page, part etc.)

      in the following the different resolution techniques are explained
      (manual as well as via a service) An example of a PWID URN is:

         urn:pwid:archive.org:2016-01-22T11:20:29Z:page:http://www.dr.dk

      has the information:

Internet-DraftA Persistent Web IDentifier (PWID) URN NamespDecember 2017


      *  archive.org
         currently known identifier in form of the Internet Archive
         domian name for their open access web archive

      *  2016-01-22T11:20:29Z
         UTC date and time associated with the archived URI

      *  page
         clarification that the reference cover the full web page with
         all its inherited parts selected by the web archive

      *  http://www.dr.dk
         archived URI of item

      With knowledge of the current (2017) Internet Archive open access
      web interface having the form:

         https://web.archive.org/web/<time>/<uri>

      We can manually (or technically) deduce an actual (current 2017)
      access https address:

         https://web.archive.org/web/20160122112029/http://www.dr.dk

      and regard the referred web page as the reference.

      The same recipe can be used for other Wayback platforms - and
      possibly also other web archive access tools platforms, as the
      crucial information is date and URI, which are requested to be
      looked up in a specified archive.

      Note that this also includes access to archives that are only
      accessible via a local proxy to a restricted environment.  Here
      the difference is that the archive information is used to identify
      the local environment used (possibly on-site) and then construct
      local http/https address based on knowledge from the local access
      installation.  In November there was created a prototype for PWIDs
      to the Netarkivet, and there are plans to extend it.

      Automatic access of a referenced web resource may work on the open
      net for open web archive or in restricted environments for the
      closed web archives.  There may be a need for varied operation
      depending on the available technology and applications, e.g.:

      *  Via locally installed browser plug-ins or applications forming
         http/https URIs:

         +  http/https URIs for standard web archive interfaces

Internet-DraftA Persistent Web IDentifier (PWID) URN NamespDecember 2017


            At this stage there are initiatives on streamlined and
            standardize APIs to web archives interfaces, - and in case
            such APIs will be implemented generally, it may be used for
            resolving of the PWID URNs.  This could be on form (denoting
            pwid parts in <> using syntax names):

               https://<archive-id>/pwid?time=<archival-
               time>&coverage=<coverage-spec>&item=<archived-item>

            The example from previous section would then resolve by

               https://archive.org/pwid?time=2016-01-22T11:20:29Z&covera
               ge=page&item=http://www.dr.dk

         +  http/https URIs for archive material for individual web
            archives
            Using the current open access http/https address pattern for
            the individual web archives, which for the example is

               https://web.archive.org/web/20160122112029/
               http://www.dr.dk

            This would require a registry of the different patterns for
            the individual web archives

      *  Via web research infrastructures this is a future solution
         scenario as a web archive research infrastructure do not yet
         exists.  However, it is a likely future scenario, as it is
         currently being proposed in the RESAW community [RESAW].  The
         PWID URN resolving could in such cases be a question of
         starting a special application, as for the 'mailto' scheme RFC
         6068 [RFC6068].

   Documentation:

      None relevant

   Additional Information:

      The PWID was orininally suggested as a URI based on research
      between a computer science researcher with know of web archiving
      and researchers from humanity subject (History and Literature).
      This resulted in the paper "Persistent Web References - Best
      Practices and New Suggestions" [IPRES]  from the iPres 2016
      conference.  In this paper the PWID is referred to as WPID.
      However, one of the feedbacks has been a concern that WPID was
      interpreted as a PID related to a PID-system, e.g. as the DOI.
      All though PID does not have a precise definition that makes it



Zierau                    Expires June 10, 2018                [Page 10]

Internet-DraftA Persistent Web IDentifier (PWID) URN NamespDecember 2017


      wrong to call it a "WPID.  The danger is that it is confused with
      PID systems, which is not the intension.  Consequently, this
      suggestion names the PWID instead.

      The comments on the drafted PWID URI ([DraftPwidUri]) has been
      that is seems to be a URN rather than a URI.  Which is the reason
      why it is now suggested as a URN, although there is a danger that
      users of the reference style can be confused by the the additional
      "urn:" prefix.

      At the RESAW 2017 conference there are two related papers: One on
      referencing practices [ResawRef] and one on research data
      management practices [ResawColl].  This practice is also planned
      to be used for Danish web collections.

   Revision Information:

      This is the initial version of PWID as a URN
