Internet-Draft            MN-HA authentication                March 2009


Abstract

   Mobile IPv6 relies on IPsec for securing the signaling between the MN
   and HA.  However, the tight coupling of the mobility protocol with
   IPsec is detrimental to broader implementation and deployment.

   This document proposes a scheme based on Identity-Based Cryptography
   mechanism to authenticate the mobile node and signaling of home
   biding update to home agent.  Hence, the use of IPsec could be
   avoided.

1.  Introduction

   Draft [1] analyzed the disadvantages of using IPsec in MIP6 [2]:

   o  While the idea of reusing IPsec for mobility signaling may have
      been sound, IPsec itself is not a good fit for various reasons: A
      MIP6 host implementation must also ensure that IPsec and IKEv2 are
      part of the stack to begin with which is unnecessary dependency.

   o  Use of IPsec in most hosts today is for VPN connectivity: IPsec
      has not evolved into a generic security mechanism for hosts.

   o  With IPsec, HA scalability (in terms of number of connections/
      BCEs) is limited by the number of IPsec SAs that can be
      terminated.

   o  Implementation complexity: While MIP6 by itself is straightforward
      to implement on the MN and HA, the interactions that are needed
      with IPsec and IKEv2 make the protocol unexpectedly difficult.

   o  It cannot be assumed that every host will have IPsec and IKEv2.
      Coupling MIP6 with IPsec and IKEv2 results in lesser number of
      hosts supporting IP mobility.

   o  The way that the IPsec code sits in the usual kernel, and the
      access mechanisms for the SA database, are not very convenient for
      use by straightforward implementations of Mobile IPv6.

   o  In certain environments the use of IPsec and IKEv2 for
      establishing the SA is considered as an overhead.

   o  Use of IPsec caused undesirable changes to protocol design.

   Hence, this document describes an alternate secure scheme between
   mobile nodes and home agents based on identity-based cryptography
   mechanism.  The identity-based cryptography can significantly reduce
   the system complexity and the cost for establishing and managing the
   public key authentication framework known as Public Key
   Infrastructure (PKI) because users' identifier information such as
   email or IP addresses instead of digital certificates can be used as
   public key for encryption or signature verification.

3.  Brief Overview of IdentityBased Cryptography

   The identity-based cryptography scheme is introduced by Shamir [4].
   This mechanism enables any pair of users to communicate securely and
   to verify each other's signatures without exchanging private or
   public keys, and without keeping key directories.  The scheme assumes
   the existence of trusted key generation centres that issue each user
   the personalized information when he first joins the network.  The
   personalized information enables the user to sign and encrypt the
   messages he sends and to decrypt and verify the message he receives
   in a totally independent way.  The key generation centre can be
   closed after all personalized information is issued and the network
   can continue to function in a completely decentralized way.

   Instead of generating a random pair of public/secret keys and
   publishing the public keys, in identity-based cryptography, the user
   chooses his name, network address, and any his unique identities as
   his public key.  The corresponding secret key is computed by key
   generation centre and issued to the user in the personalized
   information when he first joins to the network.

4.  Using Identity-Based Signature Scheme in MIP6

   In this section, we describe how to employ identity-based cryptograph
   in home biding update.  We revise the signature scheme of "identity-
   based signatures from bilinear pairings" developed by Hess [5] in
   order to suit to MIP6 specification.

4.1.  Key Generation Centre

   In MIP6, each mobile node must have a home agent at least.  Therefore
   the home agent can role as the key generation centre.  Since the sole
   purpose is to issue the personalized information to a mobile node
   when it first subscribes the service of home agent, the cost is one
   time overhead and should not downgrade obviously the performance of
   ordinary functions of home agents.

4.2.  The Processing of Identity-Based Signature between MN and HA

   (1) When a mobile node registers to a home agent as client, the home
   agent will pick a random integer t, and computes Q_HA = t*P;

   (2) Then home agent generates the secret key of the mobile node: S_MN
   = t * SHA-1(MN_ID), and issue the Q_HA and S_MN as well as the
   generator P to the mobile node.  The step (1) and (2) are typically
   done once for every subscribed mobile node.

   (3) When mobile node moves to a new network and gets its new care-of
   address, the mobile node sends a home binding update to its home
   agent:

   (a) Pick up a random integer k.

   (b) Compute r = e(S_MN, P)^k, while e is a bilinear function.

   (c) Compute v = SHA-1(CoA, r).

   (d) Compute u = v*S_MN + k*S_MN.

   (e) Finally, the mobile node sends v and u as well as the new CoA to
   its home agent.

   (4) Verify: On receiving the CoA with the signature (u, v), the home
   agent compute:

   (a) r = e(u*P) * e(SHA-1(MN_ID)-Q_HA)^v

   (b) accept the signature if and only if v = SHA-1(CoA, r)

   (5) Then home agent updates its biding cache with the new CoA.

   versions.


7.  Conclusion

   This document introduces an alternate secure scheme between mobile
   nodes and home agents based on identity-based cryptography mechanism.
   The identity-based cryptography can significantly reduce the system
   complexity and the cost for establishing and managing the public key
   authentication framework known as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
   because users' identifier information such as email or IP addresses
   instead of digital certificates can be used as public key for
   encryption or signature verification.
