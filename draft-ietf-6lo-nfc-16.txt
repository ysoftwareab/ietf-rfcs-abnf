       Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Near Field Communication
                         draft-ietf-6lo-nfc-16

Abstract

   Near Field Communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones
   and portable devices to establish radio communication with each other
   by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no
   more than 10 cm apart.  NFC standards cover communications protocols
   and data exchange formats, and are based on existing radio-frequency
   identification (RFID) standards including ISO/IEC 14443 and FeliCa.
   The standards include ISO/IEC 18092 and those defined by the NFC
   Forum.  The NFC technology has been widely implemented and available
   in mobile phones, laptop computers, and many other devices.  This
   document describes how IPv6 is transmitted over NFC using 6LoWPAN
   techniques.

1.  Introduction

   NFC is a set of short-range wireless technologies, typically
   requiring a distance between sender and receiver of 10 cm or less.
   NFC operates at 13.56 MHz, and at rates ranging from 106 kbit/s to
   424 kbit/s, as per the ISO/IEC 18000-3 air interface [ECMA-340].  NFC

Internet-Draft                IPv6 over NFC                    July 2020


   builds upon RFID systems by allowing two-way communication between
   endpoints.  NFC always involves an initiator and a target; the
   initiator actively generates an RF field that can power a passive
   target.  This enables NFC targets to take very simple form factors,
   such as tags, stickers, key fobs, or cards, while avoiding the need
   for batteries.  NFC peer-to-peer communication is possible, provided
   that both devices are powered.  As of the writing, NFC is supported
   by the main smartphone operating systems.

   NFC is often regarded as a secure communications technology, due to
   its very short transmission range.

   In order to benefit from Internet connectivity, it is desirable for
   NFC-enabled devices to support IPv6, considering its large address
   space, along with tools for unattended operation, among other
   advantages.  This document specifies how IPv6 is supported over NFC
   by using IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN)
   techniques [RFC4944], [RFC6282], [RFC6775]. 6LoWPAN is suitable,
   considering that it was designed to support IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4
   networks, and some of the characteristics of the latter are similar
   to those of NFC.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Overview of Near Field Communication Technology

   This section presents an overview of NFC, focusing on the
   characteristics of NFC that are most relevant for supporting IPv6.

   NFC enables simple, two-way, interaction between two devices,
   allowing users to perform contactless transactions, access digital
   content, and connect electronic devices with a single touch.  NFC
   utilizes key elements in existing standards for contactless card
   Technology, such as ISO/IEC 14443 A&B and JIS-X 6319-4.  NFC allows
   devices to share information at a distance up to 10 cm with a maximum
   physical layer bit rate of 424 kbps.

3.1.  Peer-to-peer Mode of NFC

   NFC defines three modes of operation: card emulation, peer-to-peer,
   and reader/writer.  Only the peer-to-peer mode enables two NFC-
   enabled devices to communicate with each other to exchange



Choi, et al.            Expires January 10, 2021                [Page 3]

   information and share files, so that users of NFC-enabled devices can
   quickly share contact information and other files with a touch.  The
   other two modes does not support two-way communications between two
   devices.  Therefore, the peer mode is used for ipv6-over-nfc.

3.2.  Protocol Stacks of NFC

   NFC defines a protocol stack for the peer-to-peer mode (Figure 1).
   The peer-to-peer mode is made in Activities Digital Protocol in NFC
   Physical Lay. The NFC Logical Link consists of Binding for IPv6-LLCP
   and Logical Link Control Protocol Layer (LLCP).  IPv6 and its
   underlying adaptation Layer (i.e., IPv6-over-NFC adaptation layer)
   are placed directly on the top of the IPv6-LLCP Binding.  An IPv6
   datagram is transmitted by the Logical Link Control Protocol (LLCP)
   with reliable, two-way transmission of information between the peer
   devices.

                      Figure 1: Protocol Stack of NFC

   The LLCP consists of Logical Link Control (LLC) and MAC Mapping.  The
   MAC Mapping integrates an existing RF protocol into the LLCP
   architecture.  The LLC contains three components, such as Link
   Management, Connection-oriented Transmission, and Connection-less
   Transmission.  The Link Management component is responsible for
   serializing all connection-oriented and connection-less LLC PDU
   (Protocol Data Unit) exchanges and for aggregation and disaggregation
   of small PDUs.  The Connection-oriented Transmission component is
   responsible for maintaining all connection-oriented data exchanges
   including connection set-up and termination.  The Connectionless

   Transmission component is responsible for handling unacknowledged
   data exchanges.

   In order to send an IPv6 packet over NFC, the packet MUST be passed
   down to the LLCP layer of NFC and carried by an Information (I) or an
   Unnumbered Information (UI) Field in an LLCP Protocol Data Unit
   (PDU).  LLCP does not support fragmentation and reassembly.  For IPv6
   addressing or address configuration, LLCP MUST provide related
   information, such as link layer addresses, to its upper layer.  The
   LLCP to IPv6 protocol binding MUST transfer the SSAP and DSAP value
   to the IPv6 over NFC protocol.  SSAP stands for Source Service Access
   Point, which is a 6-bit value meaning a kind of Logical Link Control
   (LLC) address, while DSAP means an LLC address of the destination
   NFC-enabled device.  Thus, SSAP is a source address, and DSAP is a
   destination address.

3.3.  NFC-enabled Device Addressing

   According to NFC Logical Link Control Protocol v1.3 [LLCP-1.3], NFC-
   enabled devices have two types of 6-bit addresses (i.e., SSAP and
   DSAP) to identify service access points.  Several service access
   points can be installed on a NFC device.  However, the SSAP and DSAP
   can be used as identifiers for NFC link connections with the IPv6
   over NFC adaptation layer.  Therefore, the SSAP can be used to
   generate an IPv6 interface identifier.  Address values between 00h
   and 0Fh of SSAP and DSAP are reserved for identifying the well-known
   service access points, which are defined in the NFC Forum Assigned
   Numbers Register.  Address values between 10h and 1Fh are assigned by
   the local LLC to services registered by local service environment.
   In addition, address values between 20h and 3Fh are assigned by the
   local LLC as a result of an upper layer service request.  Therefore,
   the address values between 20h and 3Fh can be used for generating
   IPv6 interface identifiers.

3.4.  MTU of NFC Link Layer

   As mentioned in Section 3.2, when an IPv6 packet is transmitted, the
   packet MUST be passed down to LLCP of NFC and transported to an
   Unnumbered Information Protocol Data Unit (UI PDU) and an Information
   Field in Protocol Data Unit (I PDU) of LLCP of the NFC-enabled peer
   device.

   The information field of an I PDU contains a single service data
   unit.  The maximum number of octets in the information field is
   determined by the Maximum Information Unit (MIU) for the data link
   connection.  The default value of the MIU for I PDUs is 128 octets.
   The local and remote LLCs each establish and maintain distinct MIU
   values for each data link connection endpoint.  Also, an LLC may

   announce a larger MIU for a data link connection by transmitting an
   optional Maximum Information Unit Extension (MIUX) parameter within
   the information field.  If no MIUX parameter is transmitted, the MIU
   value is 128 bytes.  Otherwise, the MTU size in NFC LLCP MUST be
   calculated from the MIU value as follows:

                          MTU = MIU = 128 + MIUX.

   According to [LLCP-1.3], Figure 2 shows an example of the MIUX
   parameter TLV.  The Type and Length fields of the MIUX parameter TLV
   have each a size of 1 byte.  The size of the TLV Value field is 2
   bytes.

                | 00000010 | 00000010 | 1011 | 0x0~0x7FF |
                +----------+----------+------+-----------+

                  Figure 2: Example of MIUX Parameter TLV

   When the MIUX parameter is used, the TLV Type field MUST be 0x02 and
   the TLV Length field MUST be 0x02.  The MIUX parameter MUST be
   encoded into the least significant 11 bits of the TLV Value field.
   The unused bits in the TLV Value field MUST be set to zero by the
   sender and ignored by the receiver.  The maximum possible value of
   the TLV Value field is 0x7FF, and the maximum size of the LLCP MTU is
   2176 bytes.  If fragmentation functionality is not used at the
   adaptation layer between IPv6 and NFC, the MIUX value MUST be 0x480
   to support the IPv6 MTU requirement (of 1280 bytes).

4.  Specification of IPv6 over NFC

   NFC technology also has considerations and requirements owing to low
   power consumption and allowed protocol overhead. 6LoWPAN standards
   [RFC4944], [RFC6775], and [RFC6282] provide useful functionality for
   reducing overhead which can be applied to NFC.  This functionality
   consists of link-local IPv6 addresses and stateless IPv6 address
   auto-configuration (see Section 4.2), Neighbor Discovery (see
   Section 4.4) and header compression (see Section 4.6).

4.1.  Protocol Stacks

   Figure 3 illustrates IPv6 over NFC.  Upper layer protocols can be
   transport layer protocols (e.g., TCP and UDP), application layer
   protocols, and others capable of running on top of IPv6.

                Figure 3: Protocol Stack for IPv6 over NFC

   The adaptation layer for IPv6 over NFC supports neighbor discovery,
   stateless address auto-configuration, header compression, and
   fragmentation & reassembly, based on 6LoWPAN.

4.2.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

   An NFC-enabled device performs stateless address autoconfiguration as
   per [RFC4862].  A 64-bit Interface identifier (IID) for an NFC
   interface is formed by utilizing the 6-bit NFC SSAP (see
   Section 3.3).  In the viewpoint of address configuration, such an IID
   should guarantee a stable IPv6 address during the course of a single
   connection, because each data link connection is uniquely identified
   by the pair of DSAP and SSAP included in the header of each LLC PDU
   in NFC.

   Following the guidance of [RFC7136], interface identifiers of all
   unicast addresses for NFC-enabled devices are 64 bits long and
   constructed by using the generation algorithm of random (but stable)
   identifier (RID) [RFC7217] (see Figure 4).

                  0         1         3         4       6

                 |  Random (but stable) Identifier (RID) |
                 +---------+---------+---------+---------+

                   Figure 4: IID from NFC-enabled device

   The RID is an output which is created by the algorithm, F() with
   input parameters.  One of the parameters is Net_Iface, and NFC Link
   Layer address (i.e., SSAP) is a source of the Net_Iface parameter.
   The 6-bit address of SSAP of NFC is easy and short to be targeted by
   attacks of third party (e.g., address scanning).  The F() can provide
   secured and stable IIDs for NFC-enabled devices.  In addition, an

   optional parameter, Network_ID is used to increase the randomness of
   the generated IID.

4.3.  IPv6 Link-Local Address

   The IPv6 link-local address for an NFC-enabled device is formed by
   appending the IID, to the prefix FE80::/64, as depicted in Figure 5.

   A 6LBR may obtain an IPv6 prefix for numbering the NFC network via
   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation ([RFC3633]).  The "Interface Identifier" can
   be a secured and stable IIDs.

4.4.  Neighbor Discovery

   Neighbor Discovery Optimization for 6LoWPANs ([RFC6775]) describes
   the neighbor discovery approach in several 6LoWPAN topologies, such
   as mesh topology.  NFC supports mesh topologies but most of all
   applications would use a simple multi-hop network topology or
   directly connected peer-to-peer network because NFC RF range is very
   short.

      6LBR, the NFC 6LN MUST register its address with the 6LBR by
      sending a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message with the Address
      Registration Option (ARO), and process the Neighbor Advertisement
      (NA) accordingly.  In addition, when the 6LN and 6LBR are directly
      connected, DHCPv6 is used for address assignment.  Therefore,
      Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) is not necessary between them.

   o  When two or more NFC devices are connected, there are two cases.
      One is that three or more NFC devices are linked with multi-hop
      connections, and the other is that they meet within a single hop
      range (e.g., isolated network).  In a case of multi-hop topology,
      devices which have two or more connections with neighbor devices,
      play a router for 6LR/6LBR.  In a case that they meet within a

      single hop and they have the same properties, any of them can be a
      router.

   o  For sending Router Solicitations and processing Router
      Advertisements, the NFC 6LNs MUST follow Sections 5.3 and 5.4 of
      [RFC6775].

   o  When a NFC device is a 6LR or a 6LBR, the NFC device MUST follow
      Section 6 and 7 of [RFC6775].

4.5.  Dispatch Header

   All IPv6-over-NFC encapsulated datagrams are prefixed by an
   encapsulation header stack consisting of a Dispatch value.  The only
   sequence currently defined for IPv6-over-NFC is the 6LOWPAN_IPHC
   header followed by payload, as depicted in Figure 6.

             +---------------+---------------+--------------+
             | IPHC Dispatch |  IPHC Header  |    Payload   |
             +---------------+---------------+--------------+

    Figure 6: A IPv6-over-NFC Encapsulated 6LOWPAN_IPHC Compressed IPv6
                                 Datagram

   The dispatch value is treated as an unstructured namespace.  Only a
   single pattern is used to represent current IPv6-over-NFC
   functionality.

              +------------+--------------------+-----------+
              |  Pattern   | Header Type        | Reference |

                         Figure 7: Dispatch Values

   Other IANA-assigned 6LoWPAN Dispatch values do not apply to this
   specification.

4.6.  Header Compression

   Header compression as defined in [RFC6282], which specifies the
   compression format for IPv6 datagrams on top of IEEE 802.15.4, is
   REQUIRED in this document as the basis for IPv6 header compression on
   top of NFC.  All headers MUST be compressed according to RFC 6282
   encoding formats.

Internet-Draft                IPv6 over NFC                    July 2020


   Therefore, IPv6 header compression in [RFC6282] MUST be implemented.
   Further, implementations MUST also support Generic Header Compression
   (GHC) of [RFC7400].

   If a 16-bit address is required as a short address, it MUST be formed
   by padding the 6-bit NFC link-layer (node) address to the left with
   zeros as shown in Figure 8.

                      0                   1
                      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     | Padding(all zeros)| NFC Addr. |
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                    Figure 8: NFC short address format

4.7.  Fragmentation and Reassembly Considerations

   IPv6-over-NFC SHOULD NOT use fragmentation and reassembly (FAR) for
   the payloads as discussed in Section 3.4.  The NFC link connection
   for IPv6 over NFC MUST be configured with an equivalent MIU size to
   fit the MTU of IPv6 Packet.  The MIUX value is 0x480 in order to fit
   the MTU (1280 bytes) of a IPv6 packet if NFC devices support
   extension of the MTU.

4.8.  Unicast and Multicast Address Mapping

   The address resolution procedure for mapping IPv6 non-multicast
   addresses into NFC link-layer addresses follows the general
   description in Section 4.6.1 and 7.2 of [RFC4861], unless otherwise
   specified.

   The Source/Target link-layer Address option has the following form
   when the addresses are 6-bit NFC link-layer (node) addresses.

                      0                   1
                      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

   Option fields:

      Type:

         1: for Source Link-layer address.

         2: for Target Link-layer address.

      Length:

         This is the length of this option (including the type and
         length fields) in units of 8 octets.  The value of this field
         is 1 for 6-bit NFC node addresses.

      NFC address:

         The 6-bit address in canonical bit order.  This is the unicast
         address the interface currently responds to.

   The NFC Link Layer does not support multicast.  Therefore, packets
   are always transmitted by unicast between two NFC-enabled devices.
   Even in the case where a 6LBR is attached to multiple 6LNs, the 6LBR
   cannot do a multicast to all the connected 6LNs.  If the 6LBR needs
   to send a multicast packet to all its 6LNs, it has to replicate the
   packet and unicast it on each link.

5.  Internet Connectivity Scenarios

   NFC networks can either be isolated or connected to the Internet.
   The NFC link between two communicating devices is considered to be a
   point-to-point link only.  An NFC link does not support a star
   topology or mesh network topology but only direct connections between
   two devices.  The NFC link layer does not support packet forwarding
   in link layer.

5.1.  NFC-enabled Device Connected to the Internet

   Figure 10 illustrates an example of an NFC-enabled device network
   connected to the Internet.  The distance between 6LN and 6LBR is
   typically 10 cm or less.  If there is any laptop computers close to a
   user, it will become a 6LBR.  Additionally, when the user mounts an
   NFC-enabled air interface adapter (e.g., portable NFC dongle) on the
   close laptop PC, the user's NFC-enabled device (6LN) can communicate
   with the laptop PC (6LBR) within 10 cm distance.

      Figure 10: NFC-enabled device network connected to the Internet

   Two or more 6LNs are connected with a 6LBR, but each connection uses
   a different subnet.  The 6LBR is acting as a router and forwarding
   packets between 6LNs and the Internet.  Also, the 6LBR MUST ensure
   address collisions do not occur and forwards packets sent by one 6LN
   to another.

5.2.  Isolated NFC-enabled Device Network

   In some scenarios, the NFC-enabled device network may transiently be
   a simple isolated network as shown in the Figure 11.

                                    6LN                        6LN

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations related to this document.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are the intrinsic security properties of NFC due to its short
   link range.  When interface identifiers (IIDs) are generated, devices
   and users are required to consider mitigating various threats, such
   as correlation of activities over time, location tracking, device-
   specific vulnerability exploitation, and address scanning.

   IPv6-over-NFC uses an IPv6 interface identifier formed from a "Short
   Address" and a set of well-known constant bits for the modified
   EUI-64 format.  However, NFC applications use short-lived

   where the latter is of extremely short duration.
