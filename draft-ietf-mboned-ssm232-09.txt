1.  Introduction

   Current PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) [I-D.pim-sm-v2-new] relies on the
   shared Rendezvous Point (RP) tree to learn about active sources for a
   group and to support group-generic (Any Source Multicast or ASM) data
   distribution.  The IP Multicast group address range 232/8 has been
   designated for Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) applications and
   protocols [IANA] and SHOULD support source-only trees only,
   precluding the requirement of an RP and a shared tree; active sources
   in the 232/8 range will be discovered out of band.  PIM-SM Designated
   Routers (DR), with local membership, are capable of joining the
   shortest path tree for the source directly using SSM functionality of
   PIM-SM.

   Operational best common practices in the 232/8 group address range
   are necessary to ensure shortest path source-only trees across
   multiple domains in the Internet [RFC3569], and to prevent data from
   sources sending to groups in the 232/8 range from arriving via shared
   trees.  This avoids unwanted data arrival, and allows several sources
   to use the same group address without conflict at the receivers.

   The operational practices SHOULD: o Prevent local sources from
   sending to shared tree o Prevent receivers from joining the shared
   tree o Prevent RP's as candidates for 232/8 o Prevent remote sources
   from being learned/joined via MSDP [RFC3618]

1.1.  BCP, Experimental Protocols and Normative References

   This document describes the best current practice for a widely
   deployed Experimental protocol, MSDP.  There is no plan to advance
   the MSDP's status (for example, to Proposed Standard).  The reasons
   for this include:

   o  MSDP was originally envisioned as a temporary protocol to be
      supplanted by whatever the IDMR working group produced as an
      inter-domain protocol.  However, the IDMR WG (or subsequently, the
      BGMP WG) never produced a protocol that could be deployed to
      replace MSDP.

   o  One of the primary reasons given for MSDP to be classified as
      Experimental was that the MSDP Working Group came up with
      modifications to the protocol that the WG thought made it better
      but that implementors didn't see any reasons to deploy.  Without
      these modifications (e.g., UDP or GRE encapsulation), MSDP can
      have negative consequences to initial packets in datagram streams.

   o  Scalability: Although we don't know what the hard limits might be,
      readvertising everything you know every 60 seconds clearly limits

      the amount of state you can advertise.

   o  MSDP reached near ubiquitous deployment as the de-facto standard
      inter-domain multicast protocol in the IPv4 Internet.

   o  No consensus could be reached regarding the reworking of MSDP to
      address the many concerns of various constituencies within the
      IETF.  As a result, a decision was taken to document what is
      (ubiquitously) deployed and move that document to Experimental.
      While advancement of MSDP to Proposed Standard was considered, for
      the reasons mentioned above, it was immediately discarded.

   o  The advent of source specific multicast and protocols such as bi-
      directional PIM, as well as embedded RP techniques for IPv6, have
      further reduced consensus that a replacement protocol for MSDP for
      the IPv4 Internet is required.

   The RFC Editor's policy regarding references is that they be split
   into two categories known as "normative" and "informative".
   Normative references specify those documents which must be read to
   understand or implement the technology in an RFC (or whose technology
   must be present for the technology in the new RFC to work) [RFCED].
   In order to understand this document, one must also understand both
   the PIM-SM and MSDP documents.  As a result, references to these
   documents are normative.  The IETF has adopted the policy that BCPs
   must not have normative references to Experimental protocols.
   However, this document is a special case in that the underlying
   Experimental document (MSDP) is not planned to be advanced to
   Proposed Standard.  The MBONED Working Group requests approval under
   the Variance Procedure as documented in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].  Note to
   RFC-Editor: If IETF/IESG approves this, please change the above
   sentence into: The MBONED Working Group has requested approval under
   the Variance Procedure as documented in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].  The IESG
   followed the Variance Procedure, and after an additional 4 week IETF
   Last Call evaluated the comments and status and has approved this
   document.


2.  Operational practices in 232/8

2.1.  Preventing local sources from sending to shared tree

   Eliminating the use of shared trees for groups in 232/8, while
   maintaining coexistence with ASM in PIM-SM, behavior of the RP and/or
   the DR needs to be modified.  This can be accomplished by






Shepherd, et al.        Expires December 16, 2006               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          draft-ietf-mboned-ssm232               June 2006


   o  preventing data for 232/8 groups from being sent encapsulated to
      the RP by the DR.

   o  preventing the RP from accepting registers for 232/8 groups from
      the DR.

   o  preventing the RP from forwarding accepted data down (*,G) tree
      for 232/8 groups.

2.2.  Preventing remote sources from being learned/joined via MSDP

   SSM does not require active source announcements via MSDP.  All
   source announcements are received out of band, the the last hop
   router being responsible for sending (S,G) joins directly to the
   source.  To prevent propagation of SAs in the 232/8 range, an RP
   SHOULD

   o  never originate an SA for any 232/8 groups.

   o  never accept or forward an SA for any 232/8 groups.

2.3.  Preventing receivers from joining the shared tree

   Local PIM-SM domain practices need to be enforced to prevent local
   receivers from joining the shared tree for 232/8 groups.  This can be
   accomplished by 232/8 range.

   o  preventing DR from sending (*,G) joins for 232/8 groups.

   o  preventing RP from accepting (*,G) join for 232/8 groups.

   However, within a local PIM-SM domain, any last-hop router NOT
   preventing (*,G) joins may trigger unwanted (*,G) state toward the RP
   which intersects an existing (S,G) tree, allowing the receiver on the
   shared tree to receive the data, breaking the source-specific
   [RFC3569] service model.  It is therefore recommended that ALL
   routers in the domain MUST reject AND never originate (*,G) joins for
   232/8 groups.  In those cases in which an ISP is offering its
   customers (or others) the use of the ISP's RP, the ISP SHOULD NOT
   allow (*,G) joins in the 232/8 range.

   Because SSM does not require a PIM-SM RP, all RPs SHOULD NOT offer
   themselves as candidates in the 232/8 range.  This can be
   accomplished by

   o  preventing RP/BSR from announcing in the 232/8 range

Internet-Draft          draft-ietf-mboned-ssm232               June 2006


   o  preventing ALL routers from accepting RP delegations in the 232/8
      range

   o  precluding RP functionality on RP for the 232/8 range

   Note that in typical practice, RP's announce themselves as candidates
   for the 224/4 (which obviously includes 232/8).  It is still
   acceptable to allow the advertisement of 224/4 (or any other superset
   of 232/8); however, this approach relies on the second point, above,
   namely, that routers silently just ignore the RP delegation in the
   232/8 range, and prevent sending or receiving using the shared tree,
   as described previously.  Finally, an RP SHOULD NOT be configured as
   a candidate RP for 232/8 (or more specific range).


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates no new requirements on IANA namespaces
   [RFC2434].


4.  Security Considerations

   This document describes operational practices that introduce no new
   security issues to PIM-SM in either SSM or ASM operation.  However,
   in the event that the operational practices described in this
   document are not adhered to, some problems may surface.  In
   particular, section 2.3 describes the effects of non-compliance of
   last-hop routers (or to some degree, rogue hosts sending PIM-SM
   messages themselves) on the source-specific service model; creating
   the (*,G) state for source-specific (S,G) could enable a receiver to
   receive data it should not get.  This can be mitigated by host-side
   multicast source filtering.
