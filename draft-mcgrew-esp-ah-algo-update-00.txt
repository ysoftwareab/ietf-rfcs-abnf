1.  Introduction

   This note describes and motivates a change to the "Cryptographic
   Algorithm Implementation Requirements for Encapsulating Security
   Payload (ESP) and Authentication Header (AH)", [RFC4835].  This note
   does not change the required algorithms; rather, it replaces one
   SHOULD implement algorithm with another algorithm and clarifies that
   a third algorithm (not mentioned in that RFC) is NOT RECOMMENDED.

1.1.  Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  New Algorithm Guidance

   This memo proposes the following guidance:

      An ESP implementation SHOULD include AES-128-GCM.  The use of
      HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, or HMAC-SHA-512 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
      An AH implementation SHOULD include AES-182-GMAC, and the use of
      HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, or HMAC-SHA-512 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
      This guidance does not apply to uses of HMAC or SHA-2 outside of
      ESP or AH.


3.  Rationale

   AES in Galois/Counter Mode of operation (AES-GCM) [RFC4106] [RFC4543]
   [RFC5282] should be recommended for use in ESP and AH, because it
   provides higher efficiency than currently recommended algorithms with
   equivalent security, and is required by newer IPsec profiles
   [RFC4869].

   In order for ESP and AH implementations to realize the efficiency
   benefits that GCM offers, it is important for IPsec to recognize the
   sufficiency of that algorithm.  A major benefit of GCM is smaller
   circuit size at high data rates.  However, this compactness will be
   squandered if implementations have to additionally include the
   circuits for less efficient algorithms.

   Currently, AES in Counter Mode (AES-CTR) [RFC3686] is recommended as
   a SHOULD in [RFC4835].  AES-CTR is a useful algorithm because it
   admits efficient high speed implementations.  However, it provides no
   authentication.  From RFC3686:




McGrew & Grewal          Expires August 12, 2010                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              IPsec Algorithms               February 2010


      "With AES-CTR, it is trivial to use a valid ciphertext to forge
      other (valid to the decryptor) ciphertexts.  Thus, it is equally
      catastrophic to use AES-CTR without a companion authentication
      function.  Implementations MUST use AES-CTR in conjunction with an
      authentication function, such as HMAC-SHA-1-96 [HMAC-SHA]."

   Unfortunately, none of the authentication algorithms currently
   defined for IPsec (HMAC, XCBC-MAC) admit efficient high speed
   implementations.  Thus the need for authentication undermines the
   efficiency of AES-CTR.  An unintended side effect is that users may
   be tempted to run AES-CTR without authentication for performance
   reasons, even though the standard says not to do so.

   AES-GCM was designed specifically to overcome these problems.  It is
   a "combined mode" in the ESP sense [RFC4303], that provides both
   encryption and authentication.  Internally, it combines AES-CTR with
   an authentication mechanism that can be efficiently implemented at
   high data rates.

   At the time that RFC 4835 was published (April 2007), there was not
   yet a stable normative reference for AES-GCM.  This may have
   motivated the IPsec community to not put too much reliance on that
   algorithm in its guidelines.  But November 2007 saw the publication
   of "Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Galois/
   Counter Mode (GCM) and GMAC" [800-38D], which removes any such
   concern.  An additional change in favor of AES-GCM is its wide
   adoption by cryptographic hardware and software suppliers.

3.1.  Efficiency

   GCM can be efficiently implemented in hardware, because it can be
   parallelized or fully pipelined with low latency, and it uses
   relatively efficient GF(2^128) operations.  For more information
   about performance in hardware, see the analysis of packet-processing
   and hardware in Section 3 of [MV04].

   Efficient software implementations are also possible.  With a modest
   use of memory and a precomputed table, GCM can easily match the
   performance of other encryption-and-authentication methods.  The
   benchmarks of the popular Crypto++ library show that GCM with a 2Kb
   table significantly outperforms the combination of HMAC-SHA-1 with
   any AES encryption mode [DAI].  (For the purposes of comparison, one
   can consider GCM's authentication component, which is called GMAC
   when used separately.  GMAC can be compared to HMAC-SHA-1, SHA-256
   and SHA-512.)

   When specialized hardware or implementation techniques are available,
   GCM is typically the most efficient alternative.  Kasper and Schwabe

Internet-Draft              IPsec Algorithms               February 2010


   recently published implementation strategies for modern CPUs that
   include the most efficient software implementations of any
   authentication encryption algorithm to date [KS09].  A recent report
   shows that AES-GCM can outperform the combination of AES-CBC and
   HMAC-SHA-1 by over 40%, on platforms with cryptographic instructions
   [AES-NI].  The performance margin over HMAC-SHA-256 or HMAC-SHA-512
   would be even greater.

3.2.  HMAC-SHA-2

   The Secure Hash Standard, version 2 [FIPS-180-2] defines the hash
   algorithms SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.  These functions are
   similar to the SHA-1 hash function, but have higher security goals.
   These functions are unkeyed, but they can be used in the HMAC
   algorithm [RFC2104] as a keyed message authentication code.  The use
   of the hash function HASH in this manner is denoted HMAC-HASH.

   This memo suggests that IPsec explicitly put HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-
   384, and HMAC-SHA-512 in the "NOT RECOMMENDED for ESP or AH"
   category, because those MACs neither necessary nor sufficient for
   achieving the goals of efficiency, interoperability, and security.
   There may be particular circumstances when these algorithms are
   acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be
   understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing them.
   Implications may include, e.g., higher power usage, higher circuit
   cost, lower performance in software, and incompatibility with
   implementations that do not, or can not, perform the additional
   authentication due to their preference for more efficient algorithms.
   This guidance applies only to the use of these algorithms in ESP and
   AH; it does not apply to other uses described in [RFC4868].

   AES-GCM is preferred over the use of AES-CTR with HMAC-SHA-256 for
   use in ESP and AH, because the latter combination of algorithms is
   considerably less efficient, and the former algorithm meets the
   security requirements.  HMAC-SHA-1 is believed to be secure (recall
   the "No Need for SHA-2" Open Letter [OL]), but as the industry moves
   away from SHA1, HMAC-SHA-256 may be the first algorithm that comes to
   mind for some users of IPsec.  A transition away from SHA-1 for
   digital signatures is already underway; many users plan to have that
   transition completed by the end of 2010 (see "Recommendation for
   Applications Using Approved Hash Algorithms" [800-107], for example).

   AES-CBC and HMAC-SHA1 are valuable because those algorithms are
   widely implemented.  This suggests that it makes sense to rely on
   those algorithms as mandatory-to-implement until the time comes when
   it becomes necessary or desirable to stop using HMAC-SHA1.  AES-GCM
   could be considered for use as a replacement to this combination of
   algorithms, when that time comes.

4.  Other Algorithms

   It may be desirable to revisit the advisability of other algorithms
   in RFC 4835 such as HMAC-MD5-96.  However, these considerations are
   out of scope of this note.


5.  Security Considerations

   HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512 are believed to be
   secure.  The only reason that they are not recommended is because
   they are less efficient.  No discredit to the security of these
   functions should be inferred from this guidance.

   Internally, AES-GCM consists of AES-CTR encryption with an
   authentication component that uses "universal hashing".  This
   authentication method relies solely on well understood mathematical
   properties of the hash function, rather than any unproven assumptions
   about cryptographic properties.  In particular, AES-GCM makes no
   cryptographic assumptions other than the suitability of AES as a
   pseudorandom permutation, an assumption that is also shared by AES-
   CTR.  Authentication using universal hashing is uncomplicated and has
   been well understood in cryptographic theory for decades.  These
   reasons have given confidence to the use of GCM in several standards,
   including IEEE 802.1AE Ethernet MAC security, IEEE 1619 Security in
   Storage, IPsec (ESP, AH, and IKE), and TLS.

   GCM was in the vanguard of cryptographic standards that use universal
   hashing for authentication.  While there was never any question about
   the efficacy of universal hash based authentication, some
   commentators pointed out system security aspects of GCM that are
   different than those of other algorithms.  In particular, special
   care must be taken to ensure the distinctness all of the nonce values
   used with a particular GCM or GMAC key.  The standards describing the
   use of GCM in ESP and AH already take these system security
   properties into consideration; nonetheless, the interested reader can
   find more background discussion in [MODES].

   An analysis of the security of GCM has been published [MV04]; the
   reader interested in the precise security claims is referred to that
   document.


6.  IANA Considerations

   This note has no actions for IANA.  This section should be removed by
   the RFC editor before publication as an RFC.
