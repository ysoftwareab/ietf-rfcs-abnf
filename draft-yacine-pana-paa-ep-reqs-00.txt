1. Glossary 
    
   PANA  Protocol for Carying Authentication for Network Access. 
    
   PaC (PANA Client): 
      
     The client side of the protocol that resides in the host device 
     which is responsible for providing the credentials to prove its 
     identity for network access authorization. 
      
   DI (Device Identifier): 
      
     The identifier used by the network as a handle to control and 
     police the network access of a client. Depending on the access 
     technology, this identifier might contain any of IP address, link-
     layer address, switch port number, etc. of a connected device. 
      
   PAA (PANA Authentication Agent): 
      
     The access network side entity of the protocol whose responsibility 
     is to verify the credentials provided by a PANA client and grant 
     network access service to the device associated with the client and 
     identified by a DI. 
      
   EP (Enforcement Point): 
      
     A node on the access network where per-packet enforcement policies 
     (i.e., filters) are applied on the inbound and outbound traffic of 
     client devices. Information such as DI and (optionally) 
     cryptographic keys are provided by PAA per client for constructing 
     filters on the EP. 
      
    
2. Introduction 
    
   Client access authentication should be followed by access control to 
   make sure only authenticated and authorized clients can send and 
   receive IP packets via access network. Access control can involve 
   setting access control lists on the enforcement points. 
   Identification of clients which are authorized to access the network 
   is done by the PANA protocol exchange.  
    
   PANA does not assume that the PAA is always co-located with the 
   EP(s). Network access enforcement can be provided by one or more 
   nodes on the same IP subnet as the client (e.g., multiple routers), 
   or on another subnet in the access domain (e.g., gateway to the 
   Internet, depending on the network architecture). When the PAA and 
   the EP(s) are separated, there needs to be another transport for 
   client provisioning. This transport is needed to create access

   control lists to allow authenticated and authorized clients' traffic 
   through the EPs. PANA Working Group will preferably identify an 
   existing protocol solution that allows the PAA to deliver the 
   authorization information to one or more EPs when the PAA is 
   separated from EPs. 
    
    
2.1 Scope 
    
   The following section 3 discusses the PANA framework assumptions that 
   are being made within the PANA working group. It deals with crucial 
   issues around the authentication process, when the PAA is separated 
   from EP(s). 
    
   From this standpoint, section 4 details the requirements that the 
   PAA-EP protocol must satisfy in order to meet the needs of such a 
   framework. 
    
    
3. PANA framework Assumptions/Issues 
    
3.1 Multiple PAAs 
    
   Multiple PAAs may be used for redundancy, load sharing, distributed 
   authentication, or other purposes: 
    
     a) Redundancy is the case where one or more PAAs are prepared to 
        take over if an active PAA fails.  
    
     b) Load sharing is the case where two or more PAAs are concurrently 
        active and any PaC that can be authenticated by one of the PAAs 
        can also be authenticated by any of the other PAAs. 
    
   For both redundancy and load sharing, the PAAs involved are 
   equivalently capable. The only difference between these two cases a) 
   and b) is in terms of how many active PAAs there are. 
    
     c) Distributed authentication is the case where two or more PAAs 
        are concurrently active but certain PANA requests using PANA can 
        only be serviced by certain PAAs. The logical separation can be 
        based on: 
      
         . Topology: One given PAA is in charge of authenticating a 
           pool of PaCs belonging to the same topological area. 
          
         . The ISP: One given PAA is in charge of authenticating the 
           PaCs clients to a given ISP. Then it forwards the PANA 
           requests based on the NAI or other identifier.

         . Etc. 
    
   Clearly stating the motivation for having multiples PAAs 
   authenticating PaCs and provisoning EPs in an access network has 
   direct consequences on both PaC-PAA and EP-PAA relations. 
    

3.1.1 PAA-PaC relation assumption 
    
   According to [PANA] (section "Discovery and Initial Handshake 
   Phase"), "There can be multiple PAAs on the link. The result does not 
   depend on which PAA PaC chooses. By default PaC chooses the PAA that 
   sent the first response." 
   Then, it is straighforward that the assumption that is being made 
   here is that two or more PAAs are concurrently active and any PaC 
   that can be authenticated by one of the PAAs can also be 
   authenticated by any of the other PAAs. We are clearly in the case 
   where the PaCs load is shared between the multiple PAAs (b). 
    
   Do note that discovery issues are raised with allowing muliples PAAs 
   to authenticate the various PaCs. [PANA] solves the problem simply 
   stating that the chosen PAA corresponds to the first response. It is 
   consistent with case b). 
    

3.1.2 PAA-EP relation issue 
    
   In a similar manner, it is crucial for identifying the various PAA-EP 
   protocol requirements to clearly identify the context for having 
   multiples PAAs with respect to the EPs provisoning. 
    
   One PAA have to communicate with several EPs once a PaC is 
   authenticated is a requirement for the PAA-EP protocol (see section 
   4.3). In the case where there is a single PAA, the assumption being 
   made is that the PAA will provision all the EPs. However, it remains 
   an issue in case we have multiple PAAs. 
    
   When multiple PAAs authenticate the PaC, a given PAA can either: 
    
     a) Redundancy: 
      provisions all the EPs of the underlying access network and each 
      EP has a single active PAA. A back-up PAA is ready to take over if 
      the first one fails. 
       
     b) Load sharing: 
      provisions all the EPs of the underlying access network and each 
      EP can be controlled by another active PAA.

Internet Draft   draft-yacine-pana-paa-ep-reqs-00.txt        June 2003 
 
 
     c) Distributed control: 
      provisions a pool of EPs within a given area. The pool can be 
      identified based on topological criteria for instance. 
    
   The choice between these options is motivated by PANA-specific 
   considerations. Typically, these can be: 
    
      . Scalability: 
      How many EPs are managed by the PAA(s) ? 
       
      . Symetry: 
      Does all the EPs need to be configured with the same rules ? 
       
      . Etc. 
    
    
3.2 Inter-PAAs communication 
    
   When multiple PAAs are employed, their internal organization is 
   considered an implementation issue that is beyond the scope of PANA. 
   PAAs are wholly responsible for coordinating amongst themselves to 
   provide consistency and synchronization. However, PANA does not 
   define the implementation or protocols used between PAAs, nor does it 
   define how to distribute functionality among PAAs. Nevertheless, PANA 
   will support mechanisms for PAA redundancy or fail over, and it is 
   expected that vendors will provide redundancy or fail over solutions 
   within the PANA framework.

4. PAA-EP Protocol Requirements 
    
4.1 Push model 
    
   PAA must be able to "push" the provisioning information down to EPs, 
   without any of the EPs "pulling" it. Since PANA exchange takes place 
   between PaC and PAA, EPs are unlikely to be aware of it. 
    
   EP provisioning takes place once the PaC is authenticated and 
   authorized, hence the event triggering the EP configuration takes 
   place at the PAA. Then it's straighforward to initiate the exchange 
   at the PAA. 
    
    
4.2 Pull model 
    
   The PUSH model (PAA-initiated configuration) should be used for the 
   communication between PAA and EP. 
    
   On the other hand, the PULL model (EP-initiated configuration) might 
   be supported also for the following purposes: 
    
   1. Initial EP registration/Recovery: 
      
     When a EP is newly connected to the network, it needs to register 
     itself to the PAA. 
      
     In a similar manner, when an EP crashes and comes up again, it 
     needs to re-connect its PAA. In general, when a failure is 
     detected, the EP must try to reconnect to the remote PAA or 
     attempt to connect to PAA. 
      
      
   2. (Optional) traffic-driven config (a.k.a. event-notification): 
      
     As stated in [PANA], PaC may also choose to start sending packets 
     before getting authenticated. In that case, the network should 
     detect this and send an unsolicited PANA_start message to PaC. EP 
     is the node that can detect such activity. If EP and PAA are co-
     located, then an internal mechanism (e.g. API) between the EP 
     module and the PAA module on the same host can prompt PAA to start 
     PANA. In case they are separate, there needs an explicit message 
     to prompt PAA. 
      
     Upon detecting the need to authenticate a client, EP can send a 
     trigger message to the PAA on behalf of the PaC. This can be one 
     of the messages provided by the PAA-EP protocol, or, in the 
     absence of such a facility, PAC_discovery can be used as well. 
     This message MUST carry the device identifier of the PaC. So that,

Internet Draft   draft-yacine-pana-paa-ep-reqs-00.txt        June 2003 
 
 
     PAA can send the unsolicited PANA_start message directly to the 
     PaC. 
    
    
4.3 One-to-many PAA-EP relation 
    
   One PAA have to communicate with several Eps once a PaC is 
   authenticated. The PAA-EP protocol must be able to handle this 1:n 
   communication. 
    
    
4.4 Inactive peer detection 
    
   The protocol used between PAA and EP should be able to detect 
   inactive peer within an appropriate time period. 
    
   This can be achieved by having both the EP and remote PAA constantly 
   verify their connection to each other via keep-alive messages: a 
   heartbeat in fact. 
    
    
4.5 Stateful approach 
    
   The protocol must allow to maintain some states in the PAA in order 
   for an EP that went down and came back up, or an EP that is being 
   introduced in the network to (re-)synchronize with the PAA. 
    
   In general terms, the PAA-EP protocol needs to support the stateful 
   model between the PAA and the EP(s) and some other mechanism for the 
   EP to learn the policies currently in effect on that access network. 
    
    
4.6 Recovery 
    
   TBD. 
    
   If there is awareness of a connection state in the application level 
   and we have a keepalive and/or use a reliable transport protocol 
   (similar to routing protocols), all detection and synchronizing of 
   state will come naturally. 
    
    
4.7 General Security Requirements 
    
   The PAA-EP protocol must provide for message authentication, 
   confidentiality, and integrity. 
    
   The PAA-EP protocol must define mechanisms to mitigate replay attacks 
   on the control messages.

4.8 Accounting/Feedback from the EPs 
    
   The PAA must have an efficient way to to get the accounting 
   information of PaC from EP since the PAA may be a client of the AAA 
   backend infrastructure. 
    
    
4.9 Re-use of an existing protocol 
    
   This work hopefully will not involve any new protocol design, it may 
   involve definition of new AVPs for existing protocols. The PANA 
   working group should try to re-use one of the many protocols around 
   to do this. The following protocols were mentioned for consideration: 
    
     . SNMP [SNMP] 
     . COPS-PR [COPS-PR] 
     . DIAMETER [DIAMETER] 
     . RADIUS [RADIUS] 
     . ForCES [ForCES]
