Abstract

This set of documents, collectively called the iCalendar Transport-
independent Interoperability Protocol, or iTIP, defines a transport-
independent message protocol to allow for searching busy time and the
scheduling of events, to-dos, or journal entries on different
calendaring and scheduling systems. These documents are based on earlier
work documented in the iCalendar format. Because iCalendar dealt mainly
with the format of calendaring information and said so little about the
method for conveying scheduling semantics, these documents are largely
orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) iCalendar.

Part 1 specifies the messages for allowing searching busy time
information and for scheduling events. Part 2 defines the messages for
scheduling to-dos, or action items. Part 3 defines the messages for
scheduling journal entries. This document set is intended to convey
calendaring and scheduling semantics between different applications
independent of transport. This document is also being offered as a
specification for demonstrating industry-wide, calendaring and
scheduling interoperability. The protocol defined by this document is
applicable for conveying calendaring and scheduling information across
any reliable transport. This format is useful for both client-to-server
communication, server-to-server communication, and client-to-client,
peer communication (e.g., PDA synchronization with a PIM).

The breadth of this document is limited to exchanging calendar
information only. It does not address issues related to tasks or journal

entries. Instead, the document outlines a model for calendar exchange
that defines both static and dynamic event objects. Static event objects
are used to transmit events from one entity to another without the
expectation of continuity or referential integrity with the original
item. Dynamic event objects are a superset of static event objects and
will gracefully degrade to their static counterparts for clients that
only support static appointment objects.

1 Introduction

The purpose of this document set is to define the format of iCalendar
Objects and how the iCalendar Objects are conveyed between Calendar User
Agents (CUA) and Calendar Services (CS). This involves the definition of
a protocol that uses the iCalendar Object as the basis for a collection
of messages that are transmitted from one calendaring system to another.
The protocol is transport independent but can be bound to either a real-
time transport or a store-and-forward transport such as e-mail.

This initial document specifies the messages for allowing searching for
busy time information and for scheduling events. The second document
defines the messages for scheduling to-dos, or action items. The third
document defines the messages for scheduling journal entries.
Implemented as a whole, this document set will allow different
calendaring and scheduling domains to interoperate; allowing for the
search for available busy time information and scheduling events, to-
dos, or daily journal entries.

1.1 iTIP Scheduling Transactions

The profiles described in this document may be considered additions to
[ICAL] and are designed specifically for the exchange of calendaring
information between scheduling applications.

Event Publication
. Publish an event
. Change a published event
. Cancel a published event

Group Events
. Request an event to be scheduled on one or more recipients calendars;
. Reply to an existing event request to confirm, decline, conform as
  tentative, or delegate the request;
. Allow a recipient of an event to assign delegates to attend a
  meeting;
. Allow the organizer of an event to cancel the event;
. Allow the organizer of an event to replace the original event
  definition;
. Allow an attendee the ability to negotiate event property changes
. Allow attendee to request and receive meeting updates

Free/Busy Time
. Request busy time time data from one or more recipients;
. Reply to a busy time request with busy time data;

Recurring Events and Timezones
. Support scheduling an event between individuals in different time
  zones;
. Support for time zones;
. Support for DST rules;
. Create a recurring meeting request with exception dates

2 Interoperability Models

There are two distinct protocols relevant to interoperability: an
Application Protocol and a Transport Protocol. The Application Protocol
defines the content of the iCalendar Objects sent between sender and
receiver to accomplish the Scheduling Transactions listed in section
1.1. The Transport Protocol defines how the iCalendar Objects are sent
between the sender and receiver. This document focuses on the
Application Protocol. Some considerations for Transport Protocol
documents are listed in Appendix A.

The connection between Sender and Receiver in the diagram below refers
to the Application Protocol. In particular, the iCalendar Objects passed
from the Sender to the Receiver which conform to those presented in
Section 2.1.

              +----------+                      +----------+

There are several variations of this diagram in which the Sender and
Receiver take on various roles of  CUA or CS. These variants are
detailed in the Model document [ICMS]

The architecture of iTIP is depicted in the diagram below. An
application written to this specification can work with bindings for the
store-and-forward transport, the real time transport, or both. Also note
that iTIP could be bound to other transports. If a capability is not
available on a particular transport binding, iTIP provides a mechanism
for indicating so.

2.1 Application Protocol

The model for the application protocol is centered around the organizer
of the event. That is, the organizer of a request sends it out to one or
more invitees. The attendees reply back to the organizer. The organizer
maintains the status of the event.

The data sources for the application protocol are the Calendar Users
[ICMS]. Examples of these users are the organizer and attendees of an

iCalendar event. The data objects are the iCalendar Objects that are
exchanged between Calendar Users.

2.1.1     Scheduling Transaction State

The state of the event scheduling transaction is described by the STATUS
and ATTENDEE properties in the event calendar component.

The state of an event request changes from the time it is initially
assigned, to when the attendees reply to the request, to when each of
the attendees complete the event. When an organizer sends out the event
request its state with respect to the attendees is NEEDS-ACTION. If the
attendee accepts the assignment, then the status is changed to ACCEPTED.
If the attendee rejects the assignment, then the status is changed to
DECLINED. These changes in the attendee status for the event are
effected by the attendee sending the organizer an EVENT-REPLY message.

The status of the event is reflected by the STATUS property. The event
STATUS property is controlled by the organizer. There is no default
status. The organizer can either set the event status to TENTATIVE or
CONFIRMED. The organizer can also set the status to CANCELLED by sending
an EVENT-CANCEL message to the attendees.

The states of the protocol are contained in the iCalendar Object. Due to
the individual nature of a scheduling transaction, the state may be
different for each Calendar User. The diagram below describes the
various state changes.

2.2 Advanced Calendaring Concepts

The calendaring and scheduling capability defined by this document is
based on the exchange of messages between the organizer of an event and
one or more Calendar User Agents (CUA). The message protocol emulates a
"request" and "reply" form of communications. However, there is a class
of actions that are non-interactive and are more consistent with
publishing. These include the publishing of static events.

The message format is designed to be used equally well with a MIME
electronic messaging transport, real time protocols, and other Internet
and non-Internet message transports.

This message-based protocol is based on "request" messages sent from an
originator and conveyed to one or more recipients. A recipient of a
"request" message may "reply" to the request, in order to update their
status and may also return transaction/request status information. The
protocol also supports the ability for the originator of an event to
change or cancel the original request. The elements of the protocol also
include the notion of user roles.

2.3 Calendar Roles

Roles are a behavior or set of activities performed by particular groups
of users or agents at a given state of the application. This
specification describes 4 roles that determine a range of actions and
responsibilities specific to each role. When scheduling an appointment
with 1 or more individuals, there are 2 roles: Organizer and attendee.
The organizer sends the meeting request and receives responses from
attendees. The organizer is implicitly, the owner of the meeting.

Internet Draft  iTIP Part 1 - Scheduling Events/BusyTime   July 18, 1997


However, there are scenarios where the owner has a delegate who acts on
the owner's behalf, as is the case when an assistant books a meeting. In
this scenario the organizer and the owner are different individuals yet
the organizer is still responsible for sending and receiving the
requests and managing the calendar contains this event. A delegate role
is created when an attendee delegates an event or task to another CUA.




      Role    Description


      Organi  The organizer is the user that sends and manages
      zer     the event _ meaning responses are directed to the
              organizer. In most cases the organizer is also the
              owner, but in cases where the owner delegates
              organizer responsibility to a delegate the
              organizer becomes a proxy for the owner. The
              organizer in this case would place the meeting on
              the calendar of the owner.


      Owner   The owner usually controls direct manipulation of
              the event. The owner is usually the organizer but
              in some cases a delegate or proxy will act on
              behalf of the owner and organize the meeting and
              logistics. The organizer can make unilateral
              changes to the event while the attendees can only
              act through the organizer.


      Attend  Attendees are those recipients who are invited to
      ees     the meeting. When an attendee responds the status
              property is set to either accept, decline or
              tentative. A delegate may respond on behalf of an
              attendee.


      Delega  A delegate is a proxy that acts on behalf of an
      te      attendee.




2.4 Delegation

The calendaring and scheduling model identifies three types of
delegation.

     1. 
       When an owner delegates calendar management to an organizer who
       acts on the owner's behalf

     2. 
       When an attendee grants delegate status to another calendar user

       who responds to requests on behalf of the attendee.

     3. 
       When an attendee delegates an event request to another calendar
       user who then becomes an attendee.

This document discusses only item 3. Items 1 and 2 are described in the
calendar access protocol (as described in [ICMS]).

When an attendee delegates an Event-Request they are required to notify
the organizer using an Event-Reply. This contains the necessary
information for the organizer to discern that the request was delegated
and the identity of the delegate. Section 3.2.8 describes the delegation
process in detail.

3 Application Protocol Elements

Messages are the on-the-wire MIME entities that contain calendaring
information. The particular type of [ICAL] message is referred to as the
profile type. Each profile type is identified by a profile property
specified as part of the Text/Calendar content type. The following
describes the various [ICAL] Profile Types supported in this
specification.



     Profile Type         Description


     EVENT-PUBLISH        Post notification of an event. Used
                          primarily as a method of advertising the
                          existence of an event.


     EVENT-REQUEST        Make a request for an event. This is an
                          explicit invitation to one or more

                          to be resent to the requester.




Each profile type has an associated collection of properties and
methods. Some properties are required and others are optional This
specification is also designed with the notion that some calendaring
clients will be capable of reading and posting events (where posting
means to local calendar). Therefore, profiles such as EVENT-REQUEST will
contain an exact superset of the EVENT-PUBLISH property set such that a
client that supported EVENT-PUBLISH could still read an event request.

3.1 ITIP Message Conformance

An implementation conforming to iTIP must enforce the conventions
described in the sections below. These conventions have been made to
improve interoperability. As a side benefit, they tend to simplify
implementation.

3.1.1     Restrictions on DTSTART and DTEND

DTStart must always be specified. Events containing DTEnd without a
DTStart are not allowed. If the end time is known, the DTEnd parameter
should be specified. The duration cannot be specified in conjunction
with DTStart.

3.2 Summary of Application Protocol Elements

This section outlines the complete property set for each profile type,
indicating the required (designated by the word Required), optional
(designed by the words Not Required) and excluded (designated by the
word Excluded) properties.

3.2.1     EVENT-PUBLISH

The EVENT-PUBLISH is somewhat unique in this document in that it has no
interactivity associated with it. Instead, it is simply an event that
can be added by a calendar user agent to a calendar as a static event.
It requires and accepts no responses to the organizer. Its expected
usage is for encapsulating an arbitrary event as an iCalendar object.

3.2.2     EVENT-REQUEST

The EVENT-REQUEST is used to both describe an event and invite potential
attendees. It uses the ICAL property set to describe the meeting in
terms of date/time, location, recurrence, attendees etc. When an EVENT-
REQUEST is received by a user or agent it should be responded to with an
event reply. The table below describes the both the required and
complete property set that make up an EVENT-REQUEST.

3.2.5     EVENT-REQUEST for Replacing an Event

When an organizer wishes to change an existing event in terms of time,
location, description they may replace an existing meeting by sending a
new request with the same UID and an appropriate response-sequence
number (the number should be non-zero. The receiving client should
correlate the request to an existing appointment and then check the
sequence number to realize this request is actually a replacement for
the existing meeting. Individual "A" sends a meeting request to "B" and
"C". "B" accepts the meeting and "C" declines and includes text in the
comments property proposing a more appropriate time. "A" sends "B" and
"C" another meeting request using the same UID and a sequence number of
3 (e.g., the third revision of the original event). "B" should infer
that the event request message is actually a replacement for the
existing meeting.

Replacing an event request is predicated on using the same UID,
incrementing the sequence number and replacing the salient calendar
properties.

3.2.6     EVENT-COUNTER

In the course of scheduling events an attendee may wish to modify event
properties such as time, place, included documents etc. ITIP allows for
a structured negotiation between attendee and organizer through the use
of 2 messages: EVENT-COUNTER and EVENT-DECLINECOUNTER. The attendee uses
an Event-Counter, essentially an Event-Request with the proposed
modifications, to propose changes to the organizer. The organizer

accepts or rejects some or all of the proposed modifications by either
sending a new Event-Request with an incremented sequence number and the
same UID to all attendees or replying to the attendee with an EVENT-
COUNTERDECLINE. The latter simply informs the attendee that their
counter proposal was rejected. The EVENT-COUNTER message must include a
complete description of the event.

3.2.8     EVENT-REQUEST for Delegation

EVENT-REQUEST messages may be delegated to another individual. The
message is sent by one of the attendees of an existing event request to
some other individual.

The message type MAY only be sent by one of the attendees of an existing
event request. The properties from the original event request MUST be
included in the calendar component to assure that the delegated attendee
has a complete specification of the delegated event. This MAY include a
description that reflects numerous revisions of the original request.
The message must also contain a new ATTENDEE property corresponding to
the individual being delegated to.

An EVENT-REPLY message is also sent from the Attendee delegating the
request to the organizer of the event request; indicating that the
original request is being delegated.

The EVENT-REQUEST message must assign the values of the RSVP and EXPECT
property parameters associated with the recipient delegating the request
to the ATTENDEE property of the delegate.

3.2.9     BUSY-REQUEST

This design document only addresses the transfer of busy time
information. Applications desiring free time information must infer this

from available busy time information. The Freebusy Calendar Component
MUST only be used in order to provide busy time information. The
Freebusy Calendar Component MAY only appear in the BUSY-REQUEST and
BUSY-REPLY message types or in a network resource containing busy time
data.

The busy time periods within the iCalendar Object MAY be grouped into
more than one Freebusy Calendar Component. This capability allows busy
time periods to be grouped according to some common periodicity, such as
a calendar week, month, or year. In this case, each FREEBUSY component
needs to include the ATTENDEE, DTSTART and DTEND properties to define
the free busy information in order that in might be unambiguous when
stored separately.

An iCalendar Object conforming to document MUST restrict the use of the
FREEBUSY property for representing busy time information.

The FREEBUSY property value MAY include a list of values, separated by
the COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44). Alternately, multiple busy time
periods MAY be specified with multiple instances of the FREEBUSY
property. Both forms MUST be supported by implementations conforming to
this document. Duplicate busy time periods SHOULD not be specified in an
iCalendar Object. However, two different busy time periods may overlap.

FREEBUSY properties SHOULD be sorted such that their values are in
ascending order, based on the start time, and then the end time, with
the earliest periods first. For example, today's busy time information
SHOULD appear after yesterday's busy time information. And the busy time
for this half hour SHOULD appear after the busy time for earlier today.

Since events MAY span a day boundary, free busy time period MAY also
span a day boundary. Individual "A" requests busy time from individuals
"B", "C" and "D". Individual "B" and "C" replies with busy time data to
individual "A". Individual "D" does not support busy time requests and
does not reply with any data. If the transport binding supports
exception messages, then a "unsupported capability" message is returned
by individual "D" to individual "A". The following table illustrates the
sequence of messages that would be exchanged between these individuals.

This message only permits requests for busy time information. The
message is sent from an organizer of a busy time request to one or more
intended recipients (i.e., ROLE=ATTENDEE).

3.2.10    BUSY-REPLY

The message is used to reply to an existing busy time request. The
message is sent from a recipient of a busy time request back to the
request ORGANIZER. If an ORGANIZER is not specified on the busy time
request, then the message is sent to the OWNER.

Busy time intervals are represented by individual instances of the
FREEBUSY property. There is one occurrence of the property for each busy
time interval. Duplicate busy time periods should not be returned.
However, two different busy time periods may overlap.

The FREEBUSY property value MAY include a list of values, separated by
the COMA character (ASCII decimal 44).

FREEBUSY properties SHOULD be sorted such that their values are in
ascending order, from the most recent to past. For example, today's busy
time information SHOULD appear after yesterday's busy time information.

And the busy time for this half hour SHOULD appear after the busy time
for earlier today.

Since events MAY span a day boundary, free busy time period MAY also
span a day boundary.

The busy time periods may be grouped into more than one FREEBUSY
component. This capability allows busy time periods to be grouped
according to some common periodicity, such as a calendar week, month, or
year. In this case, each FREEBUSY component needs to include the
ATTENDEE, DTSTART and DTEND properties.

The ATTENDEE property must be specified in the busy time reply. The
value is the fully qualified RFC 822 address of the recipient replying
to the busy time request.

3.4 Implementation Considerations



3.4.1     Working With Recurrence Instances

ICalendar includes a recurrence grammar to represent recurring events.
The benefit of such a grammar is the ability to represent a number of


Silverberg/Mansour/Dawson/Hopson  59                Expires January 1998



Internet Draft  iTIP Part 1 - Scheduling Events/BusyTime   July 18, 1997


events in a single object. However, while this simplifies creation of a
recurring event, meeting instances may still need to be referenced. For
instance, an attendee may decline the third instance of a recurring
Friday event. Similarly, the Organizer may change the time or location
to a single instance of the recurring event.

Since implementations may elect to store recurring events as either a
single event object or a collection of discreet, related event objects,
the protocol is designed so that each recurring instance can be both
referenced and versioned. Hence, implementations that choose to maintain
per-instance properties (such as attendee status) may do so. However,
the protocol does not require per-instance recognition unless the
instance itself must be renegotiated.

The scenarios for recurrence instance referencing are listed below. For
purposes of simplification a change to an event refers to a "trigger
property."  That is, a property that has a substantive affect on the
meeting itself such as start time, location, due date (for to-do
components) and possibly description.

Organizer initiated actions:
  .  Organizer deletes or changes a single instance of a recurring event
  .  Organizer makes changes that affect all future instances
  .  Organizer makes changes that affect all previous instances
  .  Organizer deletes or modifies a previously changed instance

Attendee initiated actions:
  .  Attendee changes status for a particular recurrence instance
  .  Attendee sends Event-Counter for a particular recurrence instance

An instance of a recurring event is assigned a unique identification,
RECURRENCE-ID, when that instance must be renegotiated. Negotiation is
necessary when the start time, end time, due date or location are
modified. If the Organizer wishes to identify a specific recurrence
instance it is done using the RECURRENCE-ID property. The property value
is equal to the date/time of the instance. If the Organizer wishes to
change the DTSTART, the original DTSTART value is used for RECURRENCE-ID
and the new DTSTART and DTEND values reflect the change. If the
Organizer wishes to add a new instance to the recurring event then an
Event-Request is issued with an RDATE equal to the new instance date. It
is recommended that the Organizer include the RECURRENCE-ID. Since the
creation of a new event instance requires negotiation, the sequence
number is also incremented.

3.4.2     When To Resend An Event

The following table is used to determine when the change to a component
or property should cause the event to be resent to all attendees. The
Resend Event key is:

     . Resend _ The event must be resent

     . Resend Not Required _ An application may resend the event if it
       wants, but it is not required

3.4.3     Timezones

If a recurring event has any instance where DTStart and DTEnd fall on
different sides of a timezone shift, the Timezone components are
required.

The threat of duplicate timezone definitions exists. Should an iCalendar
Object contain multiple conflicting timezone components, the one with
the latest DTSTART property supersedes the others.

3.4.4     Alarms

Alarms are a contentious component. It is recommended that application
software ask the user whether or not they want alarms included when they
read the event.

3.4.5     SUMMARY Property

The minimum support for the SUMMARY property in a recipient MUST be for
a 255 byte value. Implementations MAY truncate longer length values.

3.4.6     X-Tokens

To make iCalendar Objects extensible, new property types can be inserted
into components. These properties are called X-Tokens as they are
prefixed with "X-". A client is not required to make sense of X-Tokens.
Clients are not required to save X-Tokens or use them in event replies.

4 Examples



4.1 Published Event Examples

In the calendaring and scheduling context, publication refers to the one
way transfer of event information. Consumers of published events simply
incorporate the event into a calendar. No reply is expected. Individual
"A" publishes an event. Individual "B" reads the event and incorporates
it into their calendar. Events can be published in several ways
including: embedding the event as an object in a web page, e-mailing the
event to a distribution list, and posting the event to a newsgroup.

The table below illustrates the sequence of events between the publisher
and the consumers of a published event.




      Action                 Organizer                Attendee


      Publish an event       "A" sends or posts an
                             EVENT-PUBLISH message


      "B" reads the event
      publication


      Publish an updated     "A" sends or posts an
      event                  EVENT-PUBLISH message


      "B" reads the updated
      event  publication


      Cancel a published     "A" sends or posts an
      event                  EVENT-CANCEL message


      "B" reads the
      canceled event
      publication

4.1.1     A Minimal Published Event

The iCalendar Object below describes a single event that begins on July
1, 1997 at 20:00 UTC. This event contains the minimum set of properties
for an iTIP event component.

  BEGIN:VCALENDAR
  PROFILE:EVENT-PUBLISH
  PROFILE-VERSION:1.0
  PRODID:-//ACME/DesktopCalendar//EN
  VERSION:2.0
  BEGIN:VEVENT
  DTSTART:19970701T200000Z
  DTSTAMP:19970611T190000Z
  SUMMARY:ST. PAUL SAINTS -VS- DULUTH-SUPERIOR DUKES
  UID:0981234-1234234-23
  END:VEVENT
  END:VCALENDAR

4.1.2     Changing A Published Event

The iCalendar Object below describes an update to the event described in
4.1.1, the time has been changed, an end time has been added, and the
sequence number has been adjusted.

  BEGIN:VCALENDAR
  PROFILE:EVENT-PUBLISH
  PROFILE-VERSION:1.0
  VERSION:2.0
  PRODID:-//ACME/DesktopCalendar//EN
  BEGIN:VEVENT
  DTSTAMP:19970612T190000Z
  DTSTART:19970701T210000Z
  DTEND:19970701T230000Z
  SEQUENCE:2
  UID:0981234-1234234-23
  SUMMARY:ST. PAUL SAINTS -VS- DULUTH-SUPERIOR DUKES
  END:VEVENT
  END:VCALENDAR

The UID is used by the client to identify the event. The SEQUENCE
property indicates that this is the second change to the event. Events
with sequence numbers 0 and 1 are superseded by this event.

The SEQUENCE property provides a reliable way to distinguish different
versions of the same event. Each time an event is published, its
sequence number is incremented. If a client receives an event with a
sequence number 5 and finds it has the same event with sequence number
2, the event should be updated. However, if the client received an event
with sequence number 2 and finds it already has sequence number 5 of the
same event, the event should not be updated.

4.1.3     Canceling A Published Event

cancels the event with SEQUENCE numbers 0, 1, and 2.

The CLASS property is specified, though it is not really needed here.
Since this is a published event, a program that displays it need not
apply any content filtering based on the CLASS attribute. If this event
is copied into a user's calendar, the CLASS would be included as part of
the copy. The handling of the CLASS tag at that point is implementation
specific.

The RELATED-TO field contains the UID of a related calendar event. The
handling of this property is application dependent.

VTIMEZONE components are discussed in detail in [ICAL].

The sequence number 3 indicates that this event supersedes versions 0,
1, and 2.

4.2 Group Event Examples

Group events are distinguished from published events in that they have
attendees and that there is interaction between the attendees with
respect to the event. Individual "A" requests a meeting between

individuals "A", "B", "C" and "D". Individual "B" confirms attendance to
the meeting. Individual "C" declines attendance. Individual "D"
tentatively confirms their attendance. This is sometimes referred to as
"penciling-in" the event on a calendar. The following table illustrates
the sequence of messages that would be exchanged between these
individuals. The table below illustrates the message flow.

4.2.5     Delegate An Event

When delegating an event request to another calendar user, the delegator
must both update the organizer with an Event-Reply and send an EVENT-
REQUEST to the delegatee. There is currently no protocol limitation to
delegation depth. That is, it is possible for the original delegate to
delegate the meeting to someone else, and so on. When an Event-Request
is delegated from one CUA to another there are a number of
responsibilities required of the delegator. They must:

     . Send an Event-Reply to the organizer with their attendee/status
       property parameter set to "Delegated"

     . Include the delegate as an additional attendee with the
       "Delegated-From" property parameter set to the delegator

     . Set the response sequence equal to 0

     . Include the original UID of the Event-Request

The delegator must also send a copy of the original Event-Request to the
delegate. The delegator modifies the request to include:

     . The ATTENDEE/STATUS property parameter for the delegator (sender
       in this case) is set to "DELEGATED"

     . ATTENDEE/DELEGATED-TO parameter is set to the address of the
       delegatee

     . An ATTENDEE property is added for delegatee

As a rule, it is not required that the delegatee include the delegator
in their Event-Reply. However, it is strongly advised since this will
inform the delegator whether their proxy plans to attend the meeting. If
the delegatee declines the meeting, the delegator may elect to try and
delegate the Event-Request to another CUA. The process is the same.

lets the delegator know that the delegate has declined and provides an
opportunity to the delegator to either accept or delegate the request.

4.2.8     Cancel A Group Event

Individual "A" requests a meeting between individuals "A", "B" and "C".
Individual "B" declines attendance to the meeting. Individual "A"
decides to cancel the meeting. The following table illustrates the
sequence of messages that would be exchanged between these individuals.

Messages related to a previously canceled event (SEQUENCE number is less
than the SEQUENCE number of the EVENT-CANCEL message) or to-do must be
ignored.




      Action            Organizer            Attendee


      Initiate a        "A" sends EVENT-
      meeting request   REQUEST message to

                                             "C" may or may not
                                             reply to the EVENT-
                                             REQUEST message.


      Cancel the        "A" sends EVENT-
      meeting           CANCEL message to
                        "B" and "C" to
                        cancel the meeting.
                        SEQUENCE parameter
                        is "1".

Individual "A" requests busy time from individuals "B", "C" and "D".
Individual "B" and "C" replies with busy time data to individual "A".
Individual "D" does not support busy time requests and does not reply
with any data.

The following table illustrates the sequence of messages that would be
exchanged between these individuals.

Timezone components should appear in an iCalendar Object containing
recurring events. This is especially important if a recurring event has
attendees in different timezones. There can be multiple VTIMEZONE
components in an iCalendar Object, however, they must be used to define
the same timezone. That is, there cannot be VTIMEZONE components
describing both PST/PDT and EST/EDT at the component level in the same
iCalendar Object.

The first two components of this iCalendar Object are the timezone
components. The DTStart date coincides with the first instance of the
RRULE property.

The recurring meeting is defined in a particular timezone, presumably
that of the creator. The client for each attendee has the responsibility
of determining the recurrence time in the attendee's timezone.

The repeating event starts on Tuesday, July 1, 1997 at 2:00pm. Since no
timezone is specified in the DTSTART property, the timezone component of
PDT applies to the start and end times. Attendee gb@mcom.fr is in France
where the local time on this date is 7 hours later than PDT or 21:00.
Attendee kimiko@mcom.jp is in Japan where local time is 9 hours ahead of
than UTC or Wednesday, July 2 at 07:00. The event repeats weekly on
Tuesdays (in PST/PDT). The RRULE results in 20 instances. The last
instance falls on Tuesday, November 11, 1997 2:00pm PST. The RDATE adds
another instance: WED, 10-SEP-1997 21:00 GMT.

There are two exceptions to this recurring appointment. The first one
is:

4.4.4     Cancel An Exception

In the following example, the organizer has created an exception and now
wishes to cancel it. In this case an EVENT-CANCEL is sent with the
specific RECURRENCE-ID, UID, and SEQUENCE of the exception. This same
sequence can be used to decline a previously accepted modification to a
recurring event.

5.5 Latency Issues

With a store-and-forward transport, it is possible for events to arrive
out of sequence. That is, you may receive an EVENT-CANCEL notification
prior to receiving the original event. This section discusses a few of
these scenarios.

5.5.1     Cancelation of an Unknown Event.

When an EVENT-CANCEL request is received before the original EVENT-
REQUEST the calendar will be unable to correlate the UID of the
cancellation with an existing event. It is suggested that messages that
cannot be correlated that also contain non-zero sequence numbers be held
and not discarded. Implementations can age them out if no other messages
arrive with the same UID and a lower sequence number.

5.5.2     Unexpected Reply from an Unknown Delegate

When an attendee delegates an item to another calendar user they must
send an EVENT-REPLY to the organizer using the attendee properties to
indicate the fact that the request was delegated and to whom the item
was delegated. Hence it is possible for an organizer to receive an
EVENT-REPLY from a calendar user not listed as one of the original
attendees. The resolution is left to the implementation but it is
expected that the calendaring software will either accept the reply or

hold it until the Event-Response is received from the delegator. If the
version of the EVENT-REPLY is out of date the Organizer should treat the
message as a STATUS-REQUEST and update the delegate with the correct
version.

5.6 Sequence Number

Under some conditions, a CUA may receive requests and replies with the
same SEQUENCE number. DTSTAMP is added to act as a tiebreaker when two
items with the same SEQUENCE number are evaluated. Furthermore, the
SEQUENCE number is only incremented when one or more of the following
properties changes:

     . DTSTART

     . DTEND

     . LOCATION

     . DUE (for To-Do components)

6 Security Considerations

ITIP outlines an abstract transport protocol which will be bound to a
real-time transport, a store-and-forward transport, and perhaps other
transports. The transport protocol provides facilities for simple
authentication using a clear text password, as well as any SASL
mechanism [SASL]. SASL allows for integrity and privacy services to be
negotiated.

Use of clear text password is strongly discouraged where the underlying
transport service cannot guarantee confidentiality and may result in
disclosure of the password to unauthorized parties.

Appendix A. Transport Protocol Considerations

Calendar and scheduling functions are accomplished entirely through
iCalendar objects described in Section 2.1, Application Protocol. The
responsibility of exchanging the iCalendar objects belongs to the
transport. Binding documents for a real-time transport (iRIP) and a
store-and-forward transport (iMIP) are planned by the calsched working
group. Other transports bindings are possible as well. This section
discusses some of the issues that must be addressed in an iTIP binding
document.

The relevant model elements include:

     . the User, the person sending the iCalendar Object,

     . the Sender, the device used to contact a receiving device, send
       commands, and receive replies, and

     . the Receiver, the device that accepts commands and sends
       replies.

These elements are depicted below. The Sender and receiver can take on
varying roles of CUA and CS as described in [ICMS].

           +----------+                      +----------+
  +----+   |          |                      |          |
  |User|<->|  Sender  |         iTIP         | Receiver |
  +----+   |          |   Commands/Replies   |          |
           |          |<====================>|          |
           |          |                      |          |   +--------+
           |          |                      |          |<->|Calendar|
           +----------+                      +----------+   +--------+

The transport protocol must include methods for categorizing the
authenticity of the User, the Sender, and Receiver. The transport
protocol must also includes method for categorizing the connection type.
Note that secure connection technology such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
authenticates the Sender and Receiver and provides secure communication
between them, but does not authenticate the user initiating the
transfer. Also, note that the digital certificate of a user does not
authenticate the Sender nor does it mean that data transmitted between
the Sender and Receiver is private.

The basic steps which a Transport binding must addressed are listed
below.
