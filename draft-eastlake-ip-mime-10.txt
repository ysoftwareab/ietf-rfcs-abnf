Abstract

   The MIME encoding of IP packets is specified so they can conveniently
   be sent via MAIL, HTTP, etc.  This may be convenient for transmitting
   packets for analysis, debugging, monitoring, or creating application
   level tunnels.

INTERNET-DRAFT                IP over MIME                 November 2005


1. Introduction

   The Internet Protocol (IP [RFC 791]) has been profiled for
   transmission over a wide variety of media including Ethernet [RFC
   894], point to point circuits [RFC 1661], FDDI [RFC 1390], and even
   avian carriers [RFC 1149].  One of the most popular encoding and
   labeling (AKA, tagging and bagging) techniques defined for the TCP/IP
   protocol suite is the MIME encoding [RFC 2045, 2046] used, for
   example, in email, the web, and net news. This document specifies how
   to transmit IP over MIME.

   An unambiguous MIME encoding for IP datagrams is useful in their
   transmission for monitoring, analysis, debugging, or illustrative
   purposes.

   In addition, IP over MIME can be used as one component in creating
   application level tunnels.



2. MIME Type Specification

   MIME media type name: APPLICATION

   MIME subtype name: IP

   Required parameters: version

      version=n
         This parameter exposes the IP Version number [RFC 791] in the
         MIME Content-Type.

   Optional parameters: dilation, address

      dilation=nnn
         Typically IP packets will be MIME labeled for transmission over
         email or other application level protocols.  Such transmission
         is generally much slower than lower level network protocols.
         While this is not usually a concern if a packet is just being
         communicated for analysis, if such transmission is used to
         establish a tunnel, the sender of a datagram may wish to advise
         the recipient of the estimated rough time dilation factor.  For
         example, if datagrams typically take around a second and
         occasionally up to ten seconds end-to-end but it is more like a
         minute and occasionally up to ten minutes if they are MIME
         encoded in email, a "dilation=60" parameter would be
         reasonable.  (Since it is a ratio of times, the dilation
         parameter is dimensionless.)

         Note: Although IP and TCP are defined as protocols only loosely


D. Eastlake 3rd                                                 [Page 3]

         dependent on time. The IPv4 TTL [RFC 792], although originally
         defined in terms of seconds, is usually implemented as a hop
         count which is how the corresponding IPv6 field is defined [RFC
         1752].  TCP requires a retransmission timer but has no
         specified "time out" after which an unresponsive connection
         must be torn down although all practical implementations have
         such a time out. In the event that IP in MIME encapsulation is
         being used for actual connectivity, it might be desireable to
         scale all such timing by the dilation value if it has been
         provided and is reasonable.

      address=xxx
         Full, if slow, IP connectivity via an application level
         protocol such as SMTP [RFC 2821, 2822] might require that
         routing, tunneling, and/or interface entries be installed at
         each end. Routing entries would be best created or updated by
         routing protocol messages and the establishment of tunnels is
         beyond the scope of this MIME type specification.  However, the
         "address=" parameter enables the sender to optionally indicate
         an IP address for return traffic to itself.  This may only be
         useful in cases where the sender knows an address that is
         available for itself in the recipient's addressing environment.
         It can be viewed as a replacement for ARP [RFC 826] on the
         possible path to the source of the APPLICATION/IP object via
         the same application level protocol.  (A receiver of an
         APPLICATION/IP object with an "address=" parameter might
         reasonably require that it be authenticated as meeting their
         policy as to from whom they would accept such information.  For
         example, they could ignore "address=" parameters unless the
         APPLICATION/IP object was wrapped in an acceptable
         MULTIPART/SIGNED [RFC 1847] authentication, although that
         implies some trust relationship between the parties.)

         Examples:

            address="192.0.2.123"

            address="2001:DB8::123"

   Encoding considerations: Because of the binary nature of the body,
         BASE64 transfer encoding should normally be used on transports
         that do not support binary.

   Security considerations: Care should be taken under any circumstance
         where APPLICATION/IP content could be treated as a "live"
         packet.  MULTIPART/ENCRYPTED and MULTIPART/SIGNED [RFC 1847]
         may be used to further secure and/or authenticate MIME packaged
         IP traffic.

   Interoperability considerations: See [draft-eastlake-ip-mime-*.txt].
