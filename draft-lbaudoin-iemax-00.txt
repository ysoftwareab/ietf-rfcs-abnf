   Internationalized Electronic Mail Addresses in X.509 Certificates
                        draft-lbaudoin-iemax-00

Abstract

   Specifies support for internationalized email address local parts in
   X.509 certificates.  RFC6532 established support for UTF8 email
   headers hence internationalized email addresses including the local
   part.  S/MIME email also needs support for UTF8 local part email
   addresses in X.509 certificates.  This draft defines an encoding for
   UTF-8 characters in X.509 certificates which is backwards compatible
   with the IA5String encoding used to encode email addresses.

1.  Proposal

   Internationalization of names in the internet has been an ongoing
   effort for a little bit over a decade.  Internationalization of
   Domain Names was specified in RFC3490 [RFC3490] and more recently in
   RFC5890 [RFC5890] via puny-coding of the unicode representation of
   the internationalized name.  This domain name internationalization is
   supported in the current definition of the X.509 certificates RFC5280
   [RFC5280].  In particular X.509 certificates specify email addressess
   in Subject Alternative Name (SAN) and Issuer Alternative Name (IAN)
   as IA5String representation and that RFC has instructions on
   interpreting internationalized domain names in section 7.5.  More
   recently the IETF has focussed their efforts on addresses used in
   SMTP electronic mail as specified in RFCRFC5321 [RFC5321] and
   RFCRFC5322 [RFC5322].  In RFC6532 [RFC6532], email headers was
   specified to support UTF-8 unicode representation which implies
   support for unicode email addresses.

   Internationalized S/MIME email lacks a means to support unicode local
   parts in X.509 certificates which this draft proposes a solution for.
   To support the unicode local name part, this draft proposes an
   encoding for the local part of the unicode name in the X.509
   certificate SAN and IAN.  That is the encoded string starts with an
   escape character ':' to indicate to the X.509 certificate parser that
   the local name is internationalized.  Then the content of the unicode
   UTF-8 name should be base64 encoded and stored in the certificate.
   The escape colon character is a character intentionally choosen that
   is supported by IA5String but not possible in a compliant ASCII
   RFC5322 email addresses.  Support for internationalized domain names
   in the certificates is already specified in RFC5280 [RFC5280], and
   this draft does not change that interpretation.

   One potential issue for an encoded internationalized SAN or IAN email
   address is its impact on RFC5280 naming constraints particularly

   between say a draft compliant certificate and a non compliant
   implementation.  In such a scanario we believe this encoding will not
   impact this processing as mismatching local part names and
   constraints will always test negatively.  The local part should only
   match if the implementation is compliant with this draft.  Because
   the draft does not change internationalized domain name behavior,
   both the compliant and non-compliant implementation can test domain
   name constraints in the expected way.
