Abstract  
    
   Optical transport networks operated using a GMPLS-based control plane 
   enable todays network operators to offer valuable new services. With 
   the completion of a number of GMPLS signaling and routing standards 
   and the availability of products implementing them, providers are now 
   looking at ways to enable additional features, such as shared-mesh 
   restoration. These can be key to efficient network operation while 
   providing strict performance guarantees. In that context, several 
   areas of work still need to be addressed within the CCAMP WG of the 
   IETF to develop interoperable, standards-based solutions that 
   carriers can embrace. 
    
   Towards that end, this document presents the results of a serious 
   attempt to systematically gather and collate carrier inputs on 
   strategies for shared-mesh restoration and the associated issues. The 
   survey results are presented in aggregate form to provide an overview

   of carrier thinking, while retaining specific carrier response 
   confidentiality. The goal is to highlight areas of carrier concerns, 
   and identify specific work items to focus on and facilitate further 
   discussion on them. This is to enable the CCAMP WG to pursue ongoing 
   and further work in this area that is focused towards addressing the 
   identified carrier requirements.

1. Introduction 
    
   The CCAMP WG has recently completed (or nearly completed) a series of 
   GMPLS proposed standards, ranging from signaling and routing protocol 
   specifications for the IP-control of non-packet networks 
   (specifically, optical transport networks)(e.g. [3],[4],[5],[6],[7]) 
 
                         Expires ¡ April 2005                   [Page 2]

   to the development of protection and restoration terminology, 
   analysis, and functional documents (e.g. [8],[9],[10]).  
    
   These documents have provided a good foundation for further work in 
   the area, especially given that carriers are beginning now to think 
   seriously about how they will use the GMPLS control plane to enable 
   new and/or advanced services within their networks. This will provide 
   efficiencies for carriers, while providing customers with the same 
   level of service as provided today by less efficient (or more 
   expensive) means. 
    
   One key area that carriers have looked at is shared mesh restoration 
   and its associated issues. This subject while providing opportunities 
   for resource efficiency also requires carriers to be vigilant about 
   how they will meet various performance guarantees. 
    
   This document presents the collated results from a survey of several 
   major international carriers from the US, Europe and Japan, conducted 
   over the last 5 months. The goal of the survey was to systematically 
   collect carrier inputs in key areas related to control plane 
   operation and shared mesh restoration, and highlight areas for 
   further work by the CCAMP WG. The rest of the document details 
   various aspects of this survey. 
    
   The remainder of the document is organized as follows. In Section 3, 
   we provide a brief overview of the survey and its methodology, while 
   in Section 5, we present the aggregated results of the survey. We 
   conclude in Section 6. 
    
    
2. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2]. 
    
    
3. Survey Overview and Methodology 
    
   The survey consisted of nine questions directed at various aspects of 
   shared mesh restoration in carrier transport networks, and a sample 
   is shown in Section 7. It was circulated to operations and network 
   planning groups at several major international carriers, and the 
   received responses collated into six major tables that are presented 
   in Section 5.  
    
   The collation was done simply to preserve carrier anonymity.

   The definition of shared mesh restoration as used in this survey is 
   the following.  
    
   In such networks, the working paths are protected by shared 
   protection resources. As an example, a protection path can protect 
   two working paths and be used to restore traffic when either of the 
   working wavelengths fails. In other cases of shared-mesh restoration, 
   a carrier allows extra-traffic between endpoints other than the 
   source-destination of a protection path.        
   Thus a protection path cannot be cross-connected until after the 
   specific failure has occurred. 
    
    
4. Acknowledgements 
    
   We would like to thank the carriers that responded to this survey, 
   some who wished to remain anonymous.  In particular, we would like to 
   acknowledge the participation in alphabetical order of British 
   Telecom, Global Crossing, Japan Telecom, and NTT Communications. 
    
   We would also like to ask carriers whom we did not have the 
   opportunity to contact, to participate in this survey so that their 
   inputs can be included in subsequent versions of this document. 
    
    
5. Survey Results 
    
   In this section, we present the aggregated results from the carrier 
   survey, under six headings.

5.3 Key Concerns with a GMPLS-based Control Plane 
    
   This question sought to get an understanding of some of the areas in 
   which carriers may have concerns when thinking of deploying a GMPLS-
   based control plane. These included the reliability of the control 
   plane (its software and implementation), the speed with which one 
   could communicate over the control plane, the capability of the 
   control plane to integrate with existing NMSs, and the carrier view 
   of the maturity of the vendor offering.

5.4 Plans for Implementing Shared-Mesh Restoration  
    
   The goal here was to evaluate the timeframes in which carriers were 
   looking to implement shared mesh restoration in their transport 
   networks. The questions were structured in the context of a GMPLS-
   based control plane, although some carriers have responded with an 
   affirmative to this question, even when their plans to implement a 
   GMPLS-based control plane are further in the future.  
    
   This would impact the time available to develop advanced features of 
   the control plane within CCAMP, and also provide insight into why (or 
   why not) the carriers would adopt a GMPLS-based control plane (as 
   seen later). 
    
   It is evident from Table II, that there are plans to implement shared 
   mesh restoration in carrier networks in the next 2-3 years.

5.5 Attributes Key to the Adoption of Shared-Mesh Restoration 
    
   This question was designed simply to assess which attributes of 
   shared mesh restoration were key to a carrier adopting/implementing 
   it.

   This question was designed to assess the ranges of recovery speeds 
   carriers deemed appropriate.

   others a business case can be made for longer duration restorals.  
   Carrier 2 response: Closer the duct the faster in general, closer the 
   applications the slower in general. 
    
5.7 Value of Recovery Speed for Key Applications 
    
   In shared mesh restoration and other restoration scenarios, the speed 
   of recovery is often an important parameter. The question below was 
   designed to assess how important carriers thought recovery speed was 
   for the different types of traffic carried on their networks. As

   might be expected, TDM voice, VoIP, VoD, and business traffic were 
   the primary applications judged to require quick recovery speeds.

5.8 View on Current Signaling-based Solutions 
    
   A number of mechanisms may be used to perform notification of faults 
   and subsequent recovery actions. The key is to provide scalable ways 
   of disseminating failure information in the network. The question 
   below was designed to assess carrier thinking in this area. 
    
   As can be seen from Table VI, carriers surveyed uniformly agree that 
   hard bounds on recovery time are very important, and that some 
   aspects of signaling such as scalability and potential signaling 
   storms are areas of concern.

   Note: For the purposes of this survey, we define transport networks 
   that implement shared-mesh restoration as follows. In such networks, 
   the working paths are protected by shared protection resources. As an 
   example, a protection path can protect two working paths and be used 
   to restore traffic when either of the working wavelengths fails. In 
   other cases of shared-mesh restoration, a carrier allows extra-
   traffic between endpoints other than the source-destination of a 
   protection path.        
   Thus a protection path cannot be cross-connected until after the 
   specific failure has occurred.

   Response: This is actually not a good question.  When you are down at 
   optics you don't know what client layers/applications are supported.  
   So this question cannot be sensibly answered  *from the perspective 
   of SDH/OTN*.  Close to applications restoration faster than  say 1-2s 
   would be silly IMO, ie false triggering on self-healing error events 
   would happen.
