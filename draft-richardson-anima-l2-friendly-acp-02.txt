     Autonomic Control Plane design for Layer-Two Switched Networks
               draft-richardson-anima-l2-friendly-acp-02

Abstract

   This document proposes a design for an L2 aware Autonomic Control
   Plane that can be deployed easily to layer-two (Ethernet) switched
   technologies that are common on Campus/Enterprise network
   architectures.

   This document leverages the hop-by-hop announcement used in LLDP, but
   runs bulk data over normal IPv6 Link-Local unicast ethernet frames.

1.  Introduction

   The creation and maintenance of the Autonomic Control Plane described
   in [RFC8994] requires creation of hop-by-hop discovery of adjacent
   systems.  There are Campus L2 systems that are not broadcast safe
   until they have been connected to their Software Defined Networking
   (SDN) controller.  The use of the stable connectivity provided by
   [RFC8368] can provide the SDN connectivity required.

   There is a bootstrap interlocking problem: the network may be unsafe
   for ACP discovery broadcasts without the support of Spanning Tree
   Protocol (STP) or similar mechanisms until configured, yet it can not
   be automatically configured until the ACP discovery (and onboarding
   process) is done.  Meantime, because of STP complicated topological
   calculations, the convergence can be very slow for larger networks.
   This can delay on-boarding.

   In addition, forming a campus-wide network by default and using
   enabling STP does not work.  STP is not secure and could be easily
   spoofed by malicious or untrusted devices.  On manually configured
   networks today, STP is turned off on "access" ports, and enabled only
   for trunk ports.  But in an autonomic network, it is not possible to
   know a-priori which ports will be trunk ports.

   What is needed is a way to send IPv6 traffic between these L2
   switching devices in a way that is never forwarded, regardless of how
   the network is eventually configured.  This is not just an inital
   configuration problem: devices may be added and removed at any time,
   due to needed expansion of capacity, planned upgrades, or devices
   failures.

   This document proposes using LLDP for what it is good at: announcing
   capabilities, while using normal EtherType 0x86DD IPv6 frames for the
   normal ACP transport.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Protocol

   A new TLV for LLDP is allocated and called the GRASP-DULL.  The
   contents of the new TLV are the payload of the normal [RFC8994] GRASP
   DULL M_FLOOD, AN_ACP message.

   The LLDP subsystem in the control plane CPU needs to forward these
   messages along to the ACP GRASP daemon, and it needs to also include
   the source MAC address (and port number) from which the LLDP message
   was received.

   The ACP GRASP daemon can see the origin IPv6 Link-Local address from
   the GRASP DULL packet, and can now create an IPv6 neighbour cache
   entry (NCE) for that combination.  By forcing this NCE entry, the
   node avoids the need to do an unsafe multicast IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery.

   The node SHOULD unicast a Neighbor Advertisement to the corresponding
   node to establish that node's NCE.

   At this point it is possible to initiate the right key management
   daemon (IKEv2, etc.) using unicast IPv6 datagrams that only need
   unicast Ethernet packets.

3.  Onbording process

   In addition to normal operation, devices need to be onboarding.
   [RFC8995] section 4.1.1 defines the AN_PROXY message to be used for a
   new pledge to discover which neighbors are willing to act as
   onboarding proxies.

   This M_FLOOD message will fit into the same GRASP DULL M_FLOOD
   message that contains the AN_ACP message.

   After discover of an eligible neighbour, onboarding proceeds with a
   TCP connection over IPv6 link-local addresses, using unicast Ethernet
   frames.

   A pledge that is in an L2 network that is broadcast unsafe MUST NOT
   do mDNS queries as described in [RFC8995] appendix B.

4.  Other constraints

   On broadcast unsafe L2 networks, IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection
   (DAD) MUST be turned off.  Only auto-configured IPv6 link-local
   addresses using SLAAC or stable-IID [RFC7217] may be used.

5.  Privacy Considerations

   The LLDP messages commonly contain information that uniquely
   identifies a specific piece of switching equipment.  The addition of
   the GRASP DULL message will also now reveal the link-local IPv6
   addresses of the device.  This additional information is either
   derived from ethernet addresses (so no new information), or will be
   derived using [RFC7217].

6.  Security Considerations

   Unclear as yet.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to allocate a TLV from the "IANA Link Layer Discovery
   Protocol (LLDP) TLV Subtypes" https://www.iana.org/assignments/ieee-
   802-numbers/ieee-802-numbers.xhtml#iana-lldp-tlv-subtypes

   for the GRASP DULL L2 announcement.
