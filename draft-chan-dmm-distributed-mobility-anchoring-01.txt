            draft-chan-dmm-distributed-mobility-anchoring-01

Abstract

   This document defines the mobility management protocol solutions in
   the context of a distributed mobility management deployment.  Such
   solutions consider the problem of assigning a mobility anchor and a
   gateway at the initiation of a session.  In addition, the mid-session
   switching of the mobility anchor in a distributed mobility management
   environment is considered.

1.  Introduction

   A key requirement in distributed mobility management [RFC7333] is to
   enable traffic to avoid traversing single mobility anchor far from
   the optimal route.  Recent developments in research and
   standardization with respect to future deployment models call for far
   more flexibility in network function operation and management.  For
   example, the work on service function chaining at the IETF (SFC WG)
   has already identified a number of use cases for data centers.
   Although the work in SFC is not primarily concerned with mobile
   networks, the impact on IP-based mobile networks is not hard to see
   as by now most hosts connected to the Internet do so over a wireless
   medium.  For instance, as a result of a dynamic re-organization of
   service chain a non-optimal route between mobile nodes may arise if
   one relies solely on centralized mobility management.  This may also
   occur when the mobile node has moved such that both the mobile node
   and the correspondent node are far from the mobility anchor via which
   the traffic is routed.

   Recall that distributed mobility management solutions do not make use
   of centrally deployed mobility anchor.  As such, an application
   session SHOULD be able to have its traffic passing from one mobility
   anchor to another as the mobile node moves, or when changing
   operation and management (OAM) requirements call for mobility anchor
   switching, thus avoiding non-optimal routes.  This draft proposes
   enhanced mobility anchoring.


2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   All general mobility-related terms and their acronyms used in this
   document are to be interpreted as defined in the Mobile IPv6 base
   specification [RFC6275], the Proxy Mobile IPv6 specification
   [RFC5213], and the DMM current practices and gap analysis [RFC7429].
   This includes terms such as mobile node (MN), correspondent node
   (CN), home agent (HA), home address (HoA), care-of-address (CoA),
   local mobility anchor (LMA), and mobile access gateway (MAG).

   In addition, this document uses the following term:

   Home network of an application session (or of an HoA):  the network
      that has allocated the IP address (HoA) used for the session
      identifier by the application running in an MN.  An MN may be
      running multiple application sessions, and each of these sessions
      can have a different home network.

   Anchoring Function (AF):  allocation to a mobile node of an IP
      address, i.e., Home Address (HoA), or prefix, i.e., Home Network
      Prefix (HNP) topologically anchored by the advertising node.  That
      is, the anchor node is able to advertise a connected route into
      the routing infrastructure for the allocated IP prefixes.  This is
      a basic function of a mobility anchor.  With separation of control
      plane and data plane, this function may reside in a control plane
      anchor.  Then the anchor function performs the IP prefix or
      address allocation and the route advertisement for an IP anchor in
      the data plane.

   Session anchoring:  A session or a flow is anchored to a node or
      nodes when the packets of the flow traverse at least one such
      nodes.

   IP anchoring:  An IP address or prefix is topologically anchored to a
      node by an anchor function.  The IP packet will travel along a
      route which traverses that node.  The packet will also traverse
      that node if the IP address does not change.  Yet the IP address
      is changed at another node before it reaches that node, it will be
      redirected with the new IP address along a new route which may not
      traverse the original node.

   Internetwork Location Management (LM) function:  managing and keeping
      track of the internetwork location of an MN.  The location
      information may be a binding of the IP advertised address/prefix,
      e.g., HoA or HNP, to the IP routing address of the MN or of a node
      that can forward packets destined to the MN.  It is a control
      plane function.

      In a client-server protocol model, location query and update
      messages may be exchanged between a Location Management client
      (LMc) and a Location Management server (LMs).  With separation of
      control plane and data plane, this function may reside in a
      control plane anchor.  It belongs to the session anchoring
      function.

   Forwarding Management (FM) function:  packet interception and
      forwarding to/from the IP address/prefix assigned to the MN, based
      on the internetwork location information, either to the
      destination or to some other network element that knows how to
      forward the packets to their destination.

      This function belongs to session anchoring.  With separation of
      control plane and data plane, FM may split into a FM part in the
      control plane (FM-CP) which may be a function in a control plane
      anchor or mobility controller and a FM part in the data plane
      (FM-DP) which may be the function of a data plane anchor.
   Security Management (SM) function:  The security management function
      controls security mechanisms/protocols providing access control,
      integrity, authentication, authorization, confidentiality, etc.
      for the control plane and data plane.

      This function resides in all nodes such as control plane anchor,
      data plane anchor, and mobile node.


3.  Anchor Initiation and Switching

   When an IP prefix or address is topologically anchored to a node
   (data plane node), the anchor function will advertise connected route
   for it.  Then an IP packet with this IP address as its destination
   address will be forwarded along a path that traverses through this IP
   anchoring node.

   When a session or flow is anchored to a node (data plane node), the
   packets of the flow will traverse at least one such session anchoring
   node.

   A session anchoring node may differ from an IP anchoring node for an
   IP address of the session.

3.1.  IP anchoring in network of attachment

   An IP prefix or address may be anchored to the access router to which
   the MN is attached.

   For example, when an MN attaches to a network or moves to a new
   network, it is allocated an IP prefix from that network.  It
   configures from this prefix an IP address which is typically a
   dynamic IP address.  It then uses this IP address when it starts a
   new application session (an IP flow).  Packets to the MN in this flow
   simply follows the forwarding table for as long as the MN stays in
   that network.

   In this example, the flow may have terminated before the MN moves to
   a new network.  Otherwise, the flow may close and then restart using
   a new IP address configured in the new network.

   The security management function in the IP anchoring node at a new
   network must assign a valide IP prefix to a mobile node.  In the

   example, the security management function in the node anchoring
   address IP2 assigns the valid IP prefix for the mobile node.

   Figure 1.  IP anchoring in network of attachment.

3.2.  IP anchoring not in network of attachment

   An IP prefix or address may be anchored to an access router in a
   different network to which the MN is attached.  The anchor function
   is then in a network different from the network of attachment.

   An example is in using a static IP address which does not belong to
   the network of attachment.

   Another example when an MN moves to a new network is as follows.  The
   MN has an ongoing session which was initialized in a prior network of
   attachment using an IP address belonging to the network where it was
   initialized as described in Section 3.1.  When the session is unable
   to change its IP address it may continue to use its original IP
   address which is anchored not in the current network of attachment
   but in the network where the original IP address belongs.  Mobility
   support is needed to enable the ongoing session to use this original
   IP address.

   The security management function in the IP anchoring node at a new
   network must assign a valide IP prefix to a mobile node.  The
   security management function must allow the mobile node to receive or
   send data packets with an IP address configured at a prior network of
   attachment of the mobile node.

3.3.  Keeping IP anchoring in mid-session

   After the MN moves with an ongoing session to the new network (Net2),
   it obtains a new IP address or prefix from the new network (Net2).
   However, the ongoing session which was initialized in a prior network
   of attachment using an IP address belonging to the network where it
   was initialized as described in Section 3.1.  IP mobility is needed
   to use the original IP address for the ongoing session continuity.

3.4.  Changing IP anchoring (with IP address change) in mid-session

   With the MN in the example in Section 3.1 it may be desirable that
   the flow can change to the new IP address configured in the new
   network.  The packets of this flow may then follow the forwarding
   table without requiring IP layer mobility support.  Yet the flow may
   be using a higher layer mobility support which is not in the scope of
   this document to change the IP address of the flow.

   Figure 5.  Moving IP anchoring.

   As an MN with an ongoing session moves to a new network, the session
   may preserve session continuity by moving the IP anchoring of its
   original IP address to the new network.  Then the IP anchoring which
   was advertising the prefix in the original network will need to move
   to the new network.  As the IP anchoring in the new network
   advertises the prefix of the session in the new network, the
   forwarding tables will be updated so that packets of the ongoing
   session will follow the updated forwarding tables.

3.6.  Anchoring a session

   As an MN with an ongoing session moves to a new network, the session
   may use the original IP address for session continuity by anchoring
   the session to some nodes (data plane nodes) and redirecting the
   packets of this session to traverse through these session anchoring
   nodes.

   Figure 6.  Session anchoring.

   For example, a first node to anchor the session may be at the IP
   anchoring of the original IP address in the original network.  A
   second node to anchor the session may be in the new network.  Then
   packets of this session traverse the session anchoring in both the
   original network and the new network.  Forwarding management function
   at these nodes may be used to direct the flow to traverse them.

   The session's packets from the CN to the MN will then first be
   forwarded to the IP anchoring node in the original network where it
   is intercepted by the first session anchoring node.  The session
   anchoring node may possess forwarding management function to forward
   the packets to the second session anchoring node in the new network.

   In host-based mobility management, the session may be anchored in the
   new network to the MN itself.

   In network-based mobility management, the session may be anchored to
   an access router to which the MN is attached in the new network.  The
   access router may then forward the packet to the MN at L2.

   The security management function in the IP anchoring node must ensure
   that the forwarding management function establishes a secure session
   anchoring with a relevant node.  The security management function in
   the end communication nodes (i.e., mobile node and correspondent
   node) may be used to ensure a secure data plane between them.

3.7.  Changing session anchoring in mid-session

   The route of the packets of an ongoing session traversing the
   original network and the MN's new network of attachment is not
   necessarily optimal.  It can be unnecessarily long especially when
   the session anchoring nodes are far from each other even when the MN
   and CN are close to each other.  A shorter route results when the
   session is anchored in both the CN's network and the MN's network.
   An example to achieve this is to move the session anchoring from the
   original network to the CN's network.

   For anchor switching of a session in mid-session, the relevant
   context with regard to MN should be delivered to CN's anchor from the
   AR in Net 1, while the anchor switching should be notified to AR1 to
   receive packets directly forwarded by CN's anchor.  Existing IP
   mobility signaling messages such as Proxy Binding Update (PBU) and
   Proxy Binding Acknowledgment (PBA) can be used for the both
   communications with smaller option extensions as possible.  When CN's
   anchor receives packets from the CN, it encapsulates the packet with
   a tunnel header specified with IP address of CN's anchor for outer
   source IP and AR2's IP address for outer destination IP.  For the
   transparent packet delivery operation in AR2 perspective, CN's anchor
   needs to forward packets encapsulated with a tunnel header specified
   with AR1's IP address for outer source IP and AR2's IP address for
   outer destination IP.

   The security management function in the IP anchoring node must ensure
   that the forwarding management function re-establishes a secure
   session anchoring with a relevant node during mid-session.  The
   security management function in the end communication nodes may be
   used to ensure a secure data plane between them during mid-session.
