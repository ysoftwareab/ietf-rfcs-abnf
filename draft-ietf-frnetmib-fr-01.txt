          3.  The Network Management Framework

          The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
          components.  They are:

                RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing
                and naming objects for the purpose of management.  RFC 1212
                defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly
                consistent with the SMI.

                RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for
                the Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213, defines MIB-II, an
                evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new
                operational requirements.

                RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network
                access to managed objects.

             The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
             experimentation and evaluation.

          4.  Objects

          Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
          termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
          MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
          One (ASN.1) [7] defined in the SMI.  In particular, each
          object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
          object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which
          specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
          object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
          instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
          use a textual string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also
          refer to the object type.

          The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data
          structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1
          language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [3]
          purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used.
          These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.

          The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type
          is represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly
          tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is
          how the object type is represented when being transmitted on
          the network.  The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding
          rules of ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements
          imposed by the SNMP.

          4.1.  Format of Definitions

          Section 6 contains contains the specification of all object
          types contained in this MIB module.  The object types are
          defined using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended
          by the extensions specified in RFC1212 [9].

          Internet Draft     Frame Relay Service MIB        July 2, 1993


          5.  Overview

          These objects are used when the particular media being used to
          managed Frame Relay Service.  At present, this applies to
          these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-standard
          MIB:

               frame-relay-service (xx)

          This section provides an overview and background of how to use
          this MIB and other potential MIBs when managing a Frame Relay
          Service.

          The following diagram shows the MIB stack that could be
          followed for managing a Frame Relay Service.  This is only an
          example and not meant to be inclusive.

          SCOPE OF MIB:

          The Frame Relay Service MIB will only manage the Frame Relay
          portion of the network and will provide a pointer to the lower
          layer MIB (for example, a physical layer MIB or the ATM MIB)
          for each UNI/NNI logical port.

          This MIB will NOT be implemented on User Equipment.

          Internet Draft     Frame Relay Service MIB        July 2, 1993


          Frame Relay Service SNMP MIB for Customer Network Management
          (CNM) is an SNMPv1 MIB.  It provides read-only information
          that allows end-customers to obtain performance monitoring,
          fault detection, and configuration information about their
          Frame Relay Service.  By using this and other related MIBs, a
          customer's NMS can monitor their PVCs and UNI/NNI logical
          ports.  Internal aspects of the network (e.g., switching
          elements, line cards, and network routing tables) are outside
          the scope of this MIB.  The Customer's NMS will be able to
          access the SNMP proxy-agent within the Frame Relay network
          using SNMP over UDP over IP with IP encapsulated in Frame
          Relay according to RFC1294/ANSI T1.617 Annex F.  The customer
          thus has a PVC to the SNMP proxy-agent.  Alternate access
          mechanisms are possible.  The initial implementation of the
          MIB is based on SNMPv1.  The service capabilities include
          retrieving information and receiving TRAPs.  It is beyond the
          scope of this MIB to define managed objects to monitor the
          physical layer.  Existing physical layer MIBs (e.g., DS1 MIB)
          and MIB II will be used as possible.  The Frame Relay Service
          SNMP MIB for CNM will not contain any managed objects to
          monitor the physical layer.  However, the Frame Relay Service
          SNMP MIB for CNM will contain a pointer to the appropriate
          lower layer MIB for each UNI/NNI logical port.  To the maximum
          extent as possible, PVCs and SVCs will be treated equally in
          the MIB.

          The Frame Relay Service MIB will only manage the Frame Relay
          portion of the network and will provide a pointer to the lower
          layer MIB (for example, a physical layer MIB or the ATM MIB)
          for each UNI/NNI logical port.

          This MIB is only used to manage a single Frame Relay Service
          offering from one network.  If the customer's PVCs traverse
          multiple networks, then the customer needs to poll multiple
          network agents to retrieve their end-to-end view of their
          service.  This MIB will be implemented on a proxy-agent
          architecture within each Frame Relay Service network.  See
          Figure 1 and the Service Management Architecture [11].


          5.1.  Apply MIB II to a Frame Relay Service

          Use the System Group to apply to the SNMP proxy-agent, since
          the proxy-agent may be monitoring many Frame Relay devices in
          one network.  System Group applies to only one system.  This

          group is not instantiated.

          sysDescr:  ASCII string describing the SNMP proxy-agent.
                     Can be up to 255 characters long. This field is
                     generally used to indicate the network providers
                     identification and type of service offered.

          sysObjectID:  Unique OBJECT IDENTIFIER (OID) for the SNMP proxy-agent.

          sysUpTime:  Clock in the SNMP proxy-agent; TimeTicks
                      in 1/100s of a second.  Elapsed type since
                      the proxy-agent came on line.

          sysContact:  Contact for the SNMP proxy-agent.
                       ASCII string of up to 255 characters.

          sysName:  Domain name of the SNMP proxy-agent, for example,
                    acme.com

          sysLocation:  Location of the SNMP proxy-agent.
                        ASCII string of up to 255 characters.

          sysServices:  Services of the managed device.  The value "2"
                        which implies that
                        the Frame Relay network is providing
                        a subnetwork level service is recommended.

          This specifies how the Interfaces Group defined in MIB II
          shall be used for the management of Frame Relay based
          interfaces, and in conjunction with the Frame Relay Service
          MIB module. This memo assumes the interpretation of the
          Interfaces group to be in accordance with [10]: "The
          interfaces table (ifTable) contains information on the managed
          resource's interfaces.  Each sub- layer below the internetwork
          layer of a network interface is considered an interface."
          Thus, the ifTable allows the following Frame Relay-based
          interfaces to be represented as table entries:

          - Frame Relay interfaces in the Frame Relay equipment (e.g.,
            switches, routers or networks) with Frame Relay interfaces.
            This level is concerned with generic frame counts and
            not with individual virtual connections.

          In accordance with the guidelines of ifTable, frame counts per
          virtual connection are not covered by ifTable, and is

          considered interface specific and covered in the Frame Relay
          Service MIB module.  In order to interrelate the ifEntries
          properly, the Interfaces Stack Group defined in [10] shall be
          supported.

          Some specific interpretations of ifTable for Frame Relay

          5.2.  Frame Relay Service MIB Terminology

          Access Channel - An access channel generically refers to the
          DS1/E1 or DS3/E3-based UNI access channel or NNI access
          channel across which frame relay data transits. An access
          channel is the access pathway for a single stream of user
          data.

          Within a given T1 line, an access channel can denote any one
          of the following:

           o    Unchannelized T1 - the entire T1 line is considered an access
                channel. Each access channel is comprised of 24 T1 time slots.

           o    Channelized T1 - an access channel is any one of 24 channels.
                Each access channel is comprised of a single T1 time slot.

           o    Fractional T1 - an access channel is a grouping of N T1 time
                slots (NX56/64 Kbps, where N = 1-23 T1 Time slots per FT1 Access

                Channel) that may be assigned in consecutive or non-consecutive
                order.

          Within a given E1 line, a channel can denote any one of the following:

           o    Unchannelized E1 - the entire E1 line is considered a single
                access channel.  Each access channel is comprised of 31 E1 time
                slots.

           o    Channelized E1 - an access channel is any one of 31 channels.
                Each access channel is comprised of a single E1 time slot.

           o    Fractional E1 - an access channel is a grouping of N E1 time
                slots (NX64 Kbps, where N = 1-30 E1 time slots per FE1 access
                channel) that may be assigned in consecutive or non-consecutive
                order.

          Within a given unformatted line, the entire unformatted line
          is considered an access channel. Examples include RS-232,
          V.35, V.36 and X.21 (non- switched).

          Access Rate - The data rate of the access channel.  The speed
          of the user access channel determines how rapidly the end user
          can inject data into the network.

          Bc - The Committed Burst Size (Bc) is the maximum amount of
          subscriber data that the network agrees to transfer, under
          normal conditions, during a time interval Tc. Bc is offered in
          terms of bits.

          Be - The Excess Burst Size (Be) is the maximum amount of
          uncommitted data in excess of Bc that the network will attempt
          to deliver during a time interval Tc. Be is offered in terms
          of bits.

          CIR - The Committed Information Rate (CIR) is the subscriber
          data throughput that the network commits to supporting under
          normal network conditions. CIR is averaged over the Committed
          Rate Measurement Interval (Tc). CIR is offered in terms of
          bits per second.

          Permanent Virtual Connection (PVC) - A virtual connection that
          has its endpoints and bearer capabilities defined at
          subscription time.

          Time slot (E1) - An octet within the 256-bit information field
          in each E1 frame is defined as a time slot. Time slots are
          position sensitive within the 256-bit information field.
          Fractional E1 service is provided in contiguous or non-
          contiguous time slot increments.

          Time slot (T1) - An octet within the 192-bit information field
          in each T1 frame is defined as a time slot. Time slots are
          position sensitive within the 192-bit information field.
          Fractional T1 service is provided in contiguous or non-
          contiguous time slot increments.
