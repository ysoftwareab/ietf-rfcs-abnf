S= User specified


   In the above table, the DS refers to a delay sensitive service where
   the network commits to deliver with high probability user datagrams
   at a rate of PDR with minimum delay and delay requirements. Datagrams
   in excess of PDR will be discarded.

   The TS refers to a generic throughput sensitive service where the
   network commit to deliver with high probability user datagrams at a
   rate of at least CDR. The user may transmit at a rate higher than CDR
   but datagrams in excess of CDR would have a lower probability of
   being delivered.

   The BE is the best effort service and it implies that there are no
   expected service guarantees from the network.
