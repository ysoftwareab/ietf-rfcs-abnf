Abstract

   PIM establishes a neighbor relationship with other routers directly
   connected to it on startup.  Networks that are LANs or behave like a
   LAN, potentially create many PIM neighbors depending on how many
   routers are attached to it.  If such a LAN is also a transit network
   (no directly connected source or receiver), many of the PIM
   procedures don't apply.  This proposal describes a procedure to
   reduce the amount of neighbors established over a transit LAN.

Internet-Draft  PIM neighbor reduction for transit LAN's    October 2009


1.  Introduction

   PIM sends hello messages to discover other PIM enabled routers that
   are directly connected on a particular interface and form a PIM
   neighbor relationship with them.  Various PIM procedures depend on
   having a PIM neighbor elected as Designated Router (DR), like for PIM
   register messages [RFC4601] and processing IGMP reports [RFC4604].
   Most of these procedures are specific to either directly connected
   receivers or senders and do not apply to transit networks.  Networks
   that are LANs or behave like a LAN (Mi-PMSI)
   [I-D.ietf-l3vpn-2547bis-mcast] create as many PIM neighbors as there
   are PIM enabled routers directly connected to that LAN.  For networks
   where the sources and/or RPs are only in few locations, which is a
   very typical deployment, it's very likely that many of these PIM
   neighbors are never used as a target in any PIM J/P message.
   Combined with the fact that on transit networks there are no directly
   connected receivers or senders, having a PIM neighbor relationship
   with all the PIM routers over a transit LAN network seems
   unnecessary.  It is however still useful to have a PIM neighbor
   relationship with PIM routers that are used as target in the PIM Join
   or Prune (J/P) messages.  We'll discuss these later in this draft.

   The proposal is to not form any PIM neighbor relations at startup,
   but create PIM neighbors dynamically on demand.  Only PIM routers
   forwarding multicast data or on the path to the RP will be seen as a
   PIM neighbor.  Other PIM routers on that LAN that act as receivers
   will stay passive and not form neighbor relationships.  This will
   significantly reduce the number of PIM neighbors established over a
   LAN network where there are more passive receivers than there are
   senders.  Networks that have directly connected senders and/or
   receivers are outside the scope of this draft.

1.2.  Terminology


2.  Reducing the number of PIM neighbors

   PIM uses a unicast RIB to lookup the path to an upstream router for a
   particular Source or Rendezvous-Point (RP) [RFC4601].  The result of
   that lookup provides a directly connected next-hop that is used as
   the target in a PIM J/P message.  [RFC4601] currently states that
   this next-hop also needs to be a PIM neighbor in order to send a PIM

   J/P to it.  However, whether you're not sending a PIM message because
   it is not a PIM neighbor or this upstream router is unable to parse
   the join, functionally does not make a big difference.  The multicast
   tree can't be formed and traffic is interrupted.  This draft proposes
   to send a PIM J/P to a target upstream router even if it is not a PIM
   neighbor.  We also propose that a router accepts the PIM J/P and
   processes it as if it was received from a PIM neighbor.  In most
   multicast deployments it is very likely that a next-hop for a source
   and an RP is also a PIM enabled router, so this is not considered to
   be a big issue.  However, we do want to form a one-way PIM neighbor
   relationship with the target upstream router.

   If a PIM router has a desire to send a PIM J/P to a non-PIM neighbor
   U, we propose to take one bit out of the PIM Join/Prune header
   'Reserved' range and set it to 1 before we send the J/P packet.  We
   call this bit the 'Hello Request' bit.  A router that receives a PIM
   J/P with the 'Hello Request' bit on, sends a PIM hello out over the
   interface the PIM J/P was received on.  The other routers on the LAN
   will receive the PIM hello and MAY form a one-way PIM neighbor
   relationship with U. A router that receives the Hello from U and has
   no interest in it MAY ignore the Hello to limit the amount of
   neighbor state.  In the next PIM J/P the 'Hello Request' bit will be
   off because the PIM neighbor is known by the router sending the Join.
   Router U will continue to send periodic PIM Hello's out the interface
   as long as there is at least one downstream router joined over that
   interface for either a (*,G) or (S,G) state.


3.  Bidir support

   The support for PIM Bidir [RFC5015] on a LAN depends on the election
   of the Designated Forwarder (DF).  The DF election mechanism has a
   few dependencies on PIM neighbors.  [RFC5015] section 3.5.5 also
   describes a PIM Hello dependency on the DF election.  For that reason
   routers that are bidir capable and a Candidate DF will send out a PIM
   Hello over that LAN.  A PIM neighbor relationship will be established
   among the candidate DF routers.  Note that a candidate DF router on a
   LAN is a router that has an RPF interface towards the RPA that is NOT
   on that same LAN.  Please see [RFC5015] section 2.1 and 3.5.2 for
   details.  It is expected that there are few Candidate DF routers and
   it's very likely these routers are already on the path to the RPA for
   the Sparse-Mode groups.  We don't expect this procedure to add to the
   number of PIM neighbors that is etablished over that LAN.


4.  Generation ID Hello option

   PIM routers may use the generation ID in a PIM hello to make

   downstream router trigger PIM J/P's to it.  This feature is used for
   upstream router High Avalability (HA) and when a router or interface
   becomes active.  Using this feature there is no need to wait for the
   next periodic PIM J/P interval to (re)populate the forwarding state
   on the upstream router.  If a Router or LAN becomes active, it is
   allowed to send a PIM hello on that LAN interface to speed up
   convergence, but it SHOULD not continue to send hello's periodically.
   Note, it's up to the downstream router(s) to either respond to this
   PIM Hello or ignore it if there is no interest in this PIM neighbor.


5.  Unknown PIM J/P encoding

   PIM routers that receive PIM J/P messages from other routers parse
   the J/P to do either Join suppression or Prune override procedures as
   documented in [RFC4601].  If a PIM router is unable to parse the J/P
   message due to an unknown encoding (possible due to PIM Join
   attributes ([RFC5384]), the override/suppression procedures will not
   work.  If this situation occurs a router should fall back to sending
   periodic Hello messages to indicate to other routers on that LAN
   which options it's supports.

   This feature works best if all the routers support a similar PIM
   Hello option set.  If a router detects a PIM hello from an other
   router with an unknown option the network administrator MUST be
   notified in a rate limited fashion.


6.  Deployment strategy

   The PIM Hello reduction feature can be enabled on a subset of routers
   on a LAN as follows.  If it is known in advance by the network
   administrator which routers are candidate upstream targets for a PIM
   J/P, because Source(s) or RP's are reachable via these routers, these
   routers should be enabled with this PIM hello reduction feature last.
   By not enabling these routers with this feature they will continue to
   send out periodic Hello's and all downstream router that don't
   support this feature will work as normal.  The other routers on the
   LAN can be enabled with this feature which will result in not sending
   out periodic Hello's and reduce the number of PIM neighbors on that
   LAN.  If it is not known by the network administrator which routers
   are candidate targets, all the routers connected to that LAN must be
   capable of this feature before it can be enabled.


7.  Security Considerations

   For securing PIM J/P messages please see the security section in

8.  IANA considerations

   This document requests the reservation of a bit from the PIM Join/
   Prune header reserved field.  This bit field is called 'Hello
   Request' bit.
