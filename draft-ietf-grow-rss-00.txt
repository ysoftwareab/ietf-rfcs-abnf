Document History 
    
   This is the initial version of this document. 
 
1. Introduction   
    
   Understanding the dynamics of the Internet routing system is 
   fundamental to ensuring its stability and improving the mechanisms of 
   the BGP routing protocol [RFC4271]. Investigations on the Internet 
   routing system dynamics involve investigations on routing engine 
   resource consumption, in particular, memory and CPU.  
    
   System resource consumption depends on two items. First, there is the 
   size of the routing space. The greater the number of routing entries 
   there are, the greater the memory requirement on a routing device, 
   and the greater the need for increased processing and searching 
   capabilities to perform lookup operations. Second, the greater the 
   number of adjacency and peering relationships between routing 
   devices, the greater the dynamics associated with the routing 
   information updates exchanged between all these adjacencies and 
   peerings. This activity also increases the memory requirements for 
   the operation of the routing protocol. 
    
   In other words, as the routing system grows [Huston07a], so do the 
   requirements for routing engine memory and processing capacity. From 
   a routing dynamics viewpoint, minimizing the amount of BGP routing 
   information exchanged by routers is key to grappling with increasing 
   requirements on memory and CPU. 
    
   So, although current routing engines could potentially support up to 
   O(1M) routing table entries instabilities resulting i) from routing 
   protocol behavior, ii) routing protocol information exchanges, and 
   iii) changes in network topology may adversely affect the network's 
   ability to remain in a useable state for extended periods of time. 
   Note however that in terms of number of active routing entries, such 
   routing engine could at worst have to deal with O(1M) routes 
   within the next 5 years, see [Fuller07]. 
    
2. Objectives 
    
   The overall goal is to identify, root cause and document - in a 
   structured manner - occurrences of Internet routing stability 
   phenomena using data from operational networks.

Routing System Stability                                      March 2009
 
 
    
   To help accomplish this goal, the following tasks will be undertaken. 
    
   1. Development of a methodology to process and interpret routing  
      table data. One guiding principle will be to be able to reproduce  
      phenomena previously observed at different locations. This work  
      will include documenting what information to collect and how it  
      should be archived. 
    
   2. Identification of a set of stability criteria and development of  
      methods for using them to provide a better understanding of the  
      routing system's stability. Other working groups may find this  
      beneficial in addition to the GROW working group. 
    
   3. Begin investigation into how routing protocol behavior and network  
      dynamics mutually influence each other. The nature of the  
      observations collected in the first task will suggest directions  
      to proceed with this work.   
    
   This proposed approach would allow rigor and consistency to be 
   brought to the study of network and routing stability. For example, 
   it would allow for a unified approach to the cross-validation of 
   techniques for looking at improving path exploration effects on the 
   routing system. 
    
3. Relevance to the GROW working group charter  
    
   This effort fits into the GROW working group's charter to deal with 
   BGP operational issues related to routing table growth rates and the 
   dynamic properties of the routing system.  
    
   GROW has an advisory role to the IDR working group to provide 
   commentary on whether BGP is addressing relevant operational needs 
   and, where appropriate, suggest course corrections, which puts this 
   effort in a central place in the BGP investigation process. 
    
   Also, since the GROW working group community is directly linked to 
   the broader BGP operational community, this effort goes together with 
   obtaining routing table data from the field.   
    
4. Routing system stability  
    
   In order to begin the discussion defined in work item detailed in 
   Section 2, point 2, this section proposes a number of definitions for 
   common routing and network stability terms. 
    
   The stability of a routing system is characterized by its response 
   (in terms of processing routing information) to inputs of finite 
   amplitude.

   These inputs may be classified as either internal system events, such 
   as routing protocol configuration changes, or as external system 
   events, such as routing information updates. Such events are 
   sometimes loosely referred to as routing "instabilities"; however, 
   this term should be reserved for discussion about how the routing 
   system responds to such events. 
    
   A routing system, which returns to its initial equilibrium state, 
   when disturbed by an external and/or internal event, is considered to 
   be stable. 
    
   A routing system, which transitions to a new equilibrium state, when 
   disturbed by an external and/or internal event, is considered to be 
   marginally stable. 
    
   Such state transitions, whether stable or marginal, should occur 
   before the arrival of new input events. 
    
   The magnitude of the output of a stable routing system is small 
   whenever the input is small. That is, a single routing information 
   update shall not result in output amplification. Equivalently, a 
   stable system's output will always decrease to zero whenever the 
   input events stop. 
    
   A routing system, which remains in an unending condition of 
   transition from one state to another when disturbed by an external or 
   internal event, is considered to be unstable. 
    
   The degree to which a routing system, or components thereof, can 
   function correctly in the presence of input events is a measure of 
   the robustness of the system.  
    
   A precise definition of stability requires the specification of the 
   following elements: 
    
   o) The system being examined: for example, a system might be  
      comprised of: the routing system and associated events, such as  
      input events, outputs, and related arrival rates. 
    
   o) A convergence metric: a metric to define the convergence  
      characteristics of the system. 
    
   o) A stability metric: a metric that describes the degree of  
      stability of the system and indicates how close the system is to  
      being unstable.  
    
   The convergence and stability metrics may be affected by the 
   following parameters:

   o) The number of routing entries (where, each entry R toward an  
      existing prefix D has an associated attribute set A consisting of  
      AS-Path, MED, and Local Preference, etc.); 
    
   o) The number of CPU cycles, C, required to process a routing entry,  
      and its associated memory space, M; 
    
   o) The input events and their arrival rates; 
    
   o) The output events associated with the processing of each input  
      event. 
 
5. Mathematical formulation 
    
   Section 4 outlined some proposals for definitions of commonly used 
   stability terms applied to network and routing systems. In this 
   section, an initial attempt is made to build a mathematical 
   formulation around those concepts in order to begin the development 
   of more practical metrics. 

5.1 General Formulation
    
   Let RT be the "Routing Table" and RT(n) represent the routing table 
   at some time n. At time n+1, the routing table can be expressed as 
   the sum of two components: 
    
   RT(n+1) = RTo(n) + deltaRT(n+1)                 (1) 
    
   In this equation, RTo(n) is the set of routes that experience no 
   change between n and n+1, and deltaRT(n+1) accounts for all route 
   changes (additions, deletions, and changes to previously existing 
   routes) between n and n+1. deltaRT(n+1) itself can expressed as the 
   sum of two components: 
    
   deltaRT(n+1) = RTc(n+1) + RTn(n+1)              (2) 
    
   In this equation, RTc(n+1) is a set of routes at time n that 
   experience some sort of change at time n+1. Rtn(n+1) is a set of new 
   routes observed at time n+1 that were not present at time n. 
    
   RTc and RTn are each composed of two parts: one due to changes in 
   network state (new routes appearing, changes to existing routes, 
   etc.), and a second attributable to routing protocol changes (BGP 
   session failure, BGP route attribute changes, changes to filtering 
   policies, etc.). Equation (1) can be expanded to account for these 
   separate effects. First, substitute equation (2) into equation (1): 
    
   RT(n+1) = RTo(n) + RTc(n+1) + RTn(n+1)          (3)

Routing System Stability                                      March 2009
 
 
   As was mentioned, the terms RTc(n+1) and RTn(n+1) can be further 
   expanded into their two constitute components: 
    
   RTc(n+1) = RTcN(n+1) + RTcR(n+1)                (4)  
    
   RTn(n+1) = RTnN(n+1) + RTnR(n+1)                (5)   
    
   In these two equations, "N" denotes the component due to network 
   topology changes, and "R" denotes the component due to routing 
   protocol changes.  
    
   These equations can be used as the basis for deriving the convergence 
   and stability metrics discussed in Section 4. However, there are a 
   number of issues that will need to be resolved in order to make 
   progress: 
    
   a) Some thought will need to be done on how to distinguish between  
      network and routing protocol effects; 
    
   b) Some thought needs to be given to "timescales of applicability" 
      in order to make assessments about what constitutes instability 
      in a routing system from a practical point-of-view; 
    
   c) Some thought needs to given to how a protocol can absorb network  
      instabilities. [RFC2902] touches on this issue and indicated that  
      damping the effects of route updates enhances stability, but  
      possibly at the cost of reachability for some prefixes. 

5.2 Derivation of stability metrics

   In this section we propose an algorithm for calculating a stability 
   metric for a route and a routing table.

   First, we should make an attempt to quantify what we mean by stable, 
   marginally stable, and unstable in the context of the routing table 
   RT(n+1). Please note that this work is preliminary and is still in 
   the process of being refined and tested.
 
   We can start with the basic equation we previously developed:

   RT(n+1) = RTo(n) + deltaRT(n+1)
 
   Let |deltaRT(n+1)| be the magnitude of the change to the routing 
   table at some time n+1.
 
   For a routing table, RT(n+1), to be stable, the following condition 
   must be met:
 
      |deltaRT(n+1)| =< alpha as t -> infinity, 


D.Papadimitriou & J.Lowe - Expires September 2009               [Page 6] 

Routing System Stability                                      March 2009

      where alpha is a small, positive number.
 
   For marginally stable systems, the following condition must be met:
 
      alpha < |deltaRT(n+1)| =< beta as t -> infinity, 

      where beta is a small, positive number, greater than alpha.
 
   For unstable systems, the following condition is met:
 
      |deltaRT(n+1)| > beta as t -> infinity.
 
   One can see that we have not made distinctions for new routes or 
   changed routes, or for the source of disturbances to the system. 
   This is a definition of stability at the highest, or coarsest, 
   level. 
 
   As well, alpha and beta will need to be set based on some sort of 
   operational criteria. Among other things, alpha and beta will be 
   dependent on the observation sampling frequency.
 
   In order to be able to compute |deltaRT(n+1)| we need to be able 
   to calculate a stability metric for an individual route.
 
   A route, rti(n+1), which is a component of RT(n+1), consists of:
 
      rti(n+1) = {destination, path, attributes}.
 
   A stability metric for rti might be most easily defined by an 
   algorithm and in the next several paragraphs we will undertake 
   such a development.
  
   Let the stability metric associated with a route rti be called fi.
   When a route is created, the initial value of fi is 0.
 
   If rti never experiences any change, then fi remains constant at 0. 
 
   If rti does experience a change (path or attribute or withdrawal), 
   then fi changes according to the following:
 
     if rti(n+1) != rti(n) then
 
        /* the route has changed */
 
        fi(n+1) = fi(n) + 1
 
     else
 
        /* the route did not change */
 
        if fi(n) = 0 then 
 
           /* fi never drops to less than 0 */

Routing System Stability                                      March 2009

           fi(n+1) = 0
 
        else
 
          /* fi is decremented if there is no change in rti */
 
           fi(n+1) = f(n) - 1
 
        end if
 
      end if
 
   So, how does this work in the case where rti is withdrawn at some 
   time n+1? Conceivably, fi(n+1) is 1 at a minimum when withdrawal 
   occurs, and some non-zero value fi(n)+1, say gamma, at most 
   according to the algorithm. As t increases, fi is kept around 
   until it equals zero, at which time the route, rti, is discarded.

   With this definition of a stability metric for an individual 
   route, one can take a stab at calculating a stability metric for 
   an entire routing table.
  
   |deltarti(n+1)| is introduced as the change in stability metric 
   associated with a single route, rti, from t=n to t=n+1. It is used 
   to calculate |deltaRT(n+1)|, the stability metric of the entire 
   routing table, RT, at time t=n+1.
 
   |deltaRT(n+1)| is normalized so that 0 is the minimum value and 1 
   is the maximum, where 0 implies perfect stability, and 1 indicates 
   complete instability.
 
   Here is the candidate algorithm to evaluate |deltaRT(n+1)|:
 
     for i = 1 to number of routes in RT(n+1)
 
        if rti(n+1) is a new route then
 
           |deltarti(n+1)| = 0
 
        else
 
           /* rti(n+1) is an existing route */
 
           if fi(n) = 0 and fi(n+1) = 0 then
 
              /* no change occurred to the route */
 
              |deltarti(n+1)| = 0
 
           else
 
              /* a change occurred to the route */
 
              if fi(n+1) > fi(n) then

Routing System Stability                                      March 2009
 

                 |deltarti(n+1)| = [fi(n) + 1] / [fi(n+1) + 1]
 
              else
         
                 |deltarti(n+1)| = fi(n+1) / fi(n)
 
              end if
 
           end if
 
        end if
 
     end i loop
 
   |deltaRT(n+1)| = Sum(deltarti(n+1)) / total number of routes in 
   RT(n+1)

   The following notable properties can be observed: 
   - fi(n+1) and fi(n) can only be equal if they are both equal to 0 
     otherwise, fi(n+1) and fi(n) only differ by 1, and there is no 
     theoretical upper limit on either fi(n+1) or fi(n).
   - 0 =< |deltarti(n+1)| =< 1 

   We conclude this section by showing some example calculations for 
   |deltaRT(n+1)| in a number of simple, but indicative situations.

   Example 1:

   fi(n) = {0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0} and fi(n+1) = {1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0}
   |deltaRT(n+1)| = (1/2 + 2/3 + 1/2 + 0/1 + 0 + 0) / 6  
   |deltaRT(n+1)| = 0.278 (rather stable)
 
   Example 2:

   fi(n) = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0} and fi(n+1) = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
   |deltaRT(n+1)| = (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2) / 6 
   |deltaRT(n+1)| = 0.5 (possibly heading to instability, but too early 
   to judge)
 
   Example 3:

   fi(n) = {0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1} and fi(n+1) = {1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0}
   |deltaRT(n+1)| = (1/2 + 0/1 + 1/2 + 0/1 + 1/2 + 0/1) / 6 
   |deltaRT(n+1)| = 0.25 (possibly heading to instability, but too early 
   to judge)

   Example 4: 

   fi(n) = {56, 20, 63, 64, 0, 5} and fi(n+1) = {57, 19, 64, 65, 0, 4}
   |deltaRT(n+1)| = (57/58 + 19/20 + 64/65 + 65/66 + 0 + 4/5) / 6   
   |deltaRT(n+1)| = 0.784 (very unstable)

6. Previous work on BGP and Routing system stability 
    
   There have been numerous studies of BGP dynamics over the years. In 
   subsequent versions of this draft, they will be summarized in this 
   section and general findings will be drawn.  
    
   In this version of the document, we will just outline some of the 
   findings surrounding recent studies concerned with interactions of 
   BGP with Route Flap Damping (RFD) in order to show some of the 
   complexity in understanding BGP dynamics. 
    
   Work began in the early 1990s on an enhancement to the BGP called 
   "Route Flap Damping" [RFC2439]. The purpose of RFD was to prevent or 
   limit sustained route oscillations that could potentially put an 
   undue processing load on BGP. At that time there was a belief that 
   the predominate cause of route oscillation was due to BGP routing 
   sessions going up and down because they were being carried on 
   circuits that were themselves persistently going up and down (see 
   [Huston07b] for a fuller discussion). This would result in a constant 
   stream of route updates and withdrawals from the affected BGP 
   sessions that could propagate through the entire network due to the 
   network's flat addressing architecture. The first draft of the RFD 
   algorithm specification appeared in October 1993, updates and 
   revisions lead to the publication of RFC 2439, BGP Route Flap 
   Damping, in November 1998 [RFC2439].  
    
   Over the next several years, RIPE published three recommendations, 
   [RIPE178], [RIPE210] and [RIPE229] in an attempt to establish 
   guidelines for operators when setting RFD's user configurable 
   parameters. The ultimate goal was to make the deployment of RFD 
   consistent throughout the network because different vendors provided 
   different default values for RFD's various parameters, and this could 
   result in different damping behaviors across the network. The last of 
   these recommendations, [RIPE229], was published in October 2001.  
    
   In August 2002, Mao et al. [Mao02] published a paper that discussed 
   how the use of RFD, as specified in RFC 2439. They showed that RFD 
   can significantly slowdown the convergence times of relatively stable 
   routing entries. This abnormal behavior arises during route 
   withdrawal from the interaction of RFD with "BGP path exploration" 
   (in which in response to path failures or routing policy changes, 
   some BGP routers may try a sequence of transient alternate paths 
   before selecting a new path or declaring destination unreachability). 
   The NANOG 2002 presentation of Bush et al. [Bush02] succinctly 
   summarized the findings of Mao et al. [Mao02] and presented some 
   observational data to illustrate the phenomena. The overall 
   conclusion of this work was that it was best not to use RFD so that 
   the overall ability of the network to re-converge after an episode of 
   "BGP path exploration" was not needlessly slowed. In May 2006, RIPE 
   published a final set of RFD recommendations [RIPE378] that directed 
   operators to not use RFD due primarily to the findings presented in 
   [Mao02].

Routing System Stability                                      March 2009
 
   Recently, solutions such as EPIC [Chandrashekar05], or improving BGP 
   convergence through Root Cause Notification (BGP-RCN) [Pei05] have 
   been proposed to solve the "BGP path exploration" problem; however, 
   there are several details that still require consideration. 
    
   BGP stability has also been reported in [RFC4984], outcome of the 
   Routing and Addressing Workshop held by the Internet Architecture 
   Board (IAB).
