              Authentication Indicator in Kerberos Tickets
                draft-ietf-kitten-krb-auth-indicator-02

Abstract

   This document specifies an extension in the Kerberos protocol
   [RFC4120].  It defines a new authorization data type AD-
   AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR.  The purpose of introducing this data type
   is to include an indicator of the strength of a client's
   authentication in the service tickets so that application services
   can use it as an input into policy decisions.

1.  Introduction

   Kerberos [RFC4120] allows secure interaction among users and services
   over a network.  It supports a variety of authentication mechanisms
   using its pre-authentication framework [RFC6113].  The Kerberos
   authentication service has been architected to support password based
   authentication as well as multi-factor authentication using one-time
   password devices or public key cryptography.  Implementations that
   have pre-authentication mechanisms offering significantly different
   strengths of client authentication may choose to keep track of the
   strength of the authentication used as an input into policy
   decisions.

   This document specifies a new authorization data type to convey
   authentication strength to application services.  Elements of this
   type appear within an AD-CAMMAC [RFC7751] container.

2.  Document Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  AD Type Specification

   The KDC MAY include the following authorization data element, wrapped
   in AD-CAMMAC, in initial credentials, and copy it from a ticket-
   granting ticket into service tickets:

   AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR 97

Internet-Draft          Authentication Indicator                May 2016


   The corresponding ad-data field contains the DER encoding of the
   following ASN.1 type:

   AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR ::= SEQUENCE OF UTF8String

   Each UTF8String value is a short string that indicates that a
   particular set of requirements was met during the initial
   authentication.  These strings are intended to be compared against
   known values.  They are not intended to store structured data.  These
   strings MAY be site-defined strings that do not contain a colon such
   as the name of the Pre-Authentication mechanism used, or
   alternatively URIs that reference a Level of Assurance Profile
   [RFC6711].

   Authorization data elements of type AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR MUST
   be included in an AD-CAMMAC container so that their contents can be
   verified as originating from the KDC.  Elements of type AD-
   AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR MAY safely be ignored by applications and
   KDCs that do not implement this element.

4.  Security Considerations

   Elements of type AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR are wrapped in AD-CAMMAC
   containers.  AD-CAMMAC supersedes AD-KDC-ISSUED, and allows both
   application services and the KDC to verify the authenticity of the
   contained authorization data.

   KDC implementations MUST use AD-CAMMAC verifiers as described in the
   the security considerations of RFC 7751 [RFC7751] to ensure that AD-
   AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR elements are not modified by an attacker.
   Application servers MUST validate the AD-CAMMAC container before
   making authorization decisions based on AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR
   elements.  Application servers MUST NOT make authorization decisions
   based on AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR elements which appear outside of
   AD-CAMMAC containers.

   Using multiple strings in AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR MAY lead to
   ambiguity when a service tries to make a decision based on the AD-
   AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR values.  This ambiguity can be avoided if
   indicator values are always used as a positive indication of certain
   requirements being met during the initial authentication.
