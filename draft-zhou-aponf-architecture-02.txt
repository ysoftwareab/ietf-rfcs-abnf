   The Architecture for Application-based Policy On Network Functions
                    draft-zhou-aponf-architecture-02

Abstract

   Currently, there are network management applications that present
   specific demands on a communication network.  This document describes
   the APONF basic architecture, its elements and interfaces.  The main
   APONF architecture entities are the Network Management Application
   Agent (NMAA), which is a network entity that creates and runs network
   services, and Application-based Policy Decision (ABPD), which
   supports classified application models.  Each of these models support
   application demands that are similar in nature and therefore can be
   grouped/classified together.  Moreover, the ABPD maps the classified
   application models into network capabilities, e.g., network
   management and traffic policies.

1.  Introduction

   As the Internet grows, more and more new services keep on arising,
   and network traffic is rapidly increased, which may result in slow
   performance of network devices (e.g., BRAS) and poor end-user
   experience.  In addition, especially for cloud applications, the
   cloud tenants and developers usually need to use the communication
   network capabilities, such as dynamic network management and dynamic
   traffic steering, easily, accurately and efficiently.  In this way,
   the deployment of new applications and services may be accelerated
   and the user experience can be improved.

   In particular, today network operators are challenged to create an
   abstract view of their network infrastructure and help service
   developers on using and programming this abstraction rather than
   manipulating individual devices.  In this context, network management
   applications can be used to provide the required configuration and

   application programming interfaces to such service developers.
   Subsequently, a network management application can use the
   application based demands and possibly update its associated network 
   service graph. A network service graph describes the network service 
   topology. In particular, the network service topology is an 
   abstracted description of the network configuration and/or network 
   topology model associated with a network service. Examples of 
   network management applications that can modify the network service 
   graphs are for example, Distributed Data Center Application and IPv6 
   transitions, need to change the network infrastructure configuration.

   The up to date network service graph needs to (1) be communicated to 
   e.g., the network management and controlling systems, (2) map the 
   network service graph into specific network management policies, 
   i.e., device level configuration models.

   Currently, there are no IETF standard mechanisms or modeling
   languages that can directly be applied to model the network service 
   graphs.  IETF has however, created the IETF SFC WG [SFC] to document 
   a new approach to service deliver and operation, where one of its 
   goals is to realize the service Function chain that defines an
   ordered set of service functions that must be applied to packets and/
   or layer-2 frames selected as a result of classification.

   The main goal of this document is to specify the APONF basic
   architecture, its elements and interfaces.  The main APONF
   architecture entities are the Network Management Application Agent
   (NMAA) and the Application-based Policy Decision (ABPD).  NMAA is a
   network entity that creates and runs network services and is able to
   use the application based demands and possibly update their
   associated  network service graph.  The ABPD is able to map the 
   network service graphs into specific network management policies, 
   i.e., device level configuration models.  The definition of these 
   network management policies is out of the APONF scope.

2.  Terminology

   AECON (Application Enabled Collaborative Network): The main goal of
   the AECON activity (currently BOF) is to allow applications to
   explicitly signal their flow characteristics to the network.

   Device level configuration model: supports the description of the
   network management policies and it describes the configuration
   details at the device level.

   Network Management Application: Network management are Operational
   Support System (OSS) like applications that help a communication

   service provider to monitor, control, analyze and manage a
   communication network.

Internet-Draft             APONF Architecture                  July 2014

   Network configuration model: provides a declarative configuration of
   the network.

   Network topology model: describes the topology of a multi-layer
   network.

   Network service: a Network management application

   Network service graph: describes the network service 
   Topology, which is an abstracted description of the network 
   configuration and/or network topology model associated with a network 
   service.

   NFVcon (Network Functions Virtualization configuration): The main
   goal of this activity (BOF status) is to support the dynamic
   configuration of NFV instances.

   Service Function Chain (SFC): A service Function chain defines an
   ordered set of service functions that must be applied to packets and/
   or layer-2 frames selected as a result of classification.  The
   implied order may not be a linear progression as nodes may copy to
   more than one branch.  The term service chain is often used as
   shorthand for service function chain.

   Service Function Path (SFP): The instantiation of a service function
   chain in the network.  Packets follow a service function path from a
   classifier through the required instances of service functions in the
   network.

   VNF (Virtualized Network Function): An implementation of an
   executable software program that constitutes the whole or a part of
   an NF and can be deployed on a virtualization infrastructure.

3.  Overview of the APONF Architecture

   This section depicts an overview of the architecture of application-
   based policy on network functions.  Figure 1 shows APONF
   architecture.  The basic components of the APONF architecture are:

   Network Management Application: Operational Support System (OSS) like
   applications that help a communication service provider to monitor,
   control, analyze and manage a communication network.  Several network
   management applications MAY communicate with the Application Based
   Policy Decision block via the Network Management Application Agent.

   The Network Management Application Agent (NMAA):The NMAA is part of
   the network management application and is a network entity that
   creates and runs network services.  These network services should be
   developed by an operator, which are assumed to be already available.
   The NMAA is able to generate for each of these network services and
   using application based demands a SFP based network configuration and
   network topology model.

Internet-Draft             APONF Architecture                  July 2014

   Application Based Policy Decision(ABPD): A network entity which
   provides an interface to NMAA(s) and is able to map the classified
   application based models, which are including the classified
   application based demands and the network service graph, into 
   specific network management policies, i.e., device level 
   configuration models, which are used by the communication network.  
   ABPD can communicate with multiple NMAAs simultaneously.

   Network Element (NE):handles incoming packets based on the ABDP
   network management policies and the corresponding network management
   and manipulation procedures.

   Figure 1 shows the basic architecture of application-based policy on
   network functions.

4.  Network Management Applications

   This architecture is expected to be used for several categories of
   network management applications.  Such network management
   applications are representing the realizations of the APONF use
   cases, which are: "Distributed Data Center " 
   [ID.draft-cheng-aponf-ddc-use-cases], "IPv6 transition " 
   [ID.draft-sun-aponf-openv6-use-cases],

   "Virtualized Enterprise Applications " 
   [ID.draft-huang-aponf-use-cases] , "Source Address Validation and 
   Traceback (SAVI)" [ID.draft-bi-aponf-sdsavi], and "Using the abstract 
   view of network by service developers" 
   [ID.draft-liu-aponf-using-abstract-view-use-case].

   These network management applications are represented by a set of
   network services.  Each network service can be represented by a
   classified application based policy model, since it can model the
   group of demands coming from a bundle of applications that impose
   similar requirements on the communication network.  Such network
   services can be "Distributed Data Center ", " IPv6 transition ",
   "Virtualized Enterprise Applications " and "Source Address Validation
   and Traceback (SAVI) " and "Using the abstract view of network by
   service developers". For each network service a network service graph 
   needs to be generated and maintained. 

4.1.  Network Management Application Agent (NMAA)

   The NMAA is part of the network management application and is a
   network entity that creates and runs network services.  These network
   services should be developed by an operator, which are assumed to be
   already available.

   The assumption here is that the network management application has a
   complete view of the available network and network capabilities that
   it can use.  Moreover, it is assumed that the network management
   application is able to have the abstract view of the network and on
   how the network service is mapped into this abstract view.  This
   network abstract view is defined using the network service graph . It 
   is assumed that the NMAA can use the network service description and 
   that it is able to create and maintain the network service graph. 

   An NMAA is a typical OSS gateway or Network Management Station
   entity, that needs to support the following new functional blocks as
   shown in Figure 2:

                Figure 2: NMAA Functionality Block Diagram

   o  Typical OSS (Operations Support System) features.

   o  Create/Update network service graphs: this is a NMAA functional 
      block and is used by the NMAA to use the network service 
      description and create or update a network service graph.
      The assumption used here is that the description of the network
      services is provided to end user applications in such a way that
      the end user application developer can use and program certain
      network capabilities such that the end user QoE can significantly 
      be increased. The modified versions of the network service are 
      made known to the network management application and NMAA.  This 
      event initiates the update of the network service graph.

   o  End User Application Interaction: this functional block is used to
      provide and receive information to/from the end user application
      engine.  This functional block is in charge to provide the
      description of the network services to end user applications in
      such a way that the end user application developer can use and
      program certain network capabilities such that the end user QoE 
      can significantly be increased. This functional block is also used 
      to receive the modified versions of the network service from the 
      end user application and to inform the "Create/Update network 
      service graph" functional block about this change. This event 
      initiates the update of the network service graph. Note that it is 
      assumed that the realization of this functional block and the 
      interface with the end user are out of the APONF's scope.

   o  "NMAA - ABDP interface": this functional block is used to support 
      a signaling protocol used between NMAA and the ABDP. Note that 
      one candidate signaling protocol that can be used for this purpose 
      is an enhanced version of NSIS denoted as APONF NSIS protocol 
      engine as described in Section 7.

   The Network Management Application Agent (NMAA) will use the APONF
   interface to communicate with the Application Based Policy Decision
   (ABPD) entity.

5.  Application Based Policy Decision

   The Application-Based Policy Decision (ABPD) block, is a an entity
   used between the Network Management Applications and the network
   elements to provide and maintain the application based policies.  It
   supports the APONF interface/protocol and is a software repository,
   which stores the information associated with each NE, and maps the
   classified application models, i.e., application based demands and
   the network service graph, into existing network management policies, 
   i.e., device configuration models. In particular, by creating 
   application based policies that mirror application semantics, a 
   better mapping to existing network management policies can be 
   realized.  This provides a simple, self-documenting mechanism for 
   capturing application-based policy requirements and mapping them to 
   existing network management policies.  This will allow applications 
   to use the network capabilities in a more accurate and efficient way.

   Figure 3 illustrates the ABPD functionality block diagram, which is
   based on [ID.farrkingel-pce-abno-architecture] and enhanced to
   satisfy the demands of the APONF use cases.

   The Application Based Policy Decision (ABPD) block includes all the
   functional blocks provided in Figure 1 of
   [ID.farrkingel-pce-abno-architecture], together with the following
   new defined functional blocks:

   o  Fresh network service graphs Maintenance: maintains a fresh 
      abstract view of the network.  Note that this is realized using 
      the network service graph that is created by the NMAA. Important 
      to note that for each network service / classified application 
      model that is managed by a network management application a 
      different network service graph is needed.  So in order to support 
      this the APONF architecture needs to support a functional block 
      that stores all these abstract views of the network in different 
      network service graphs that are identified by an unique ID.

                Figure 3: ABPD Functionality Block Diagram



   o  Application to Network Mapping: the following features are
      supported by this functional block:

      1.  Translates the actions and the changed network service graph 
          received from the network management application, see 
          explanation below, to a new network service graph.  This is 
          accomplished by using application based demands generated by 
          network management applications systems to map the network 
          service graph into specific network management policies,
          i.e., into device level configuration models.  Such
          application based demands are:

             Encapsulating, de-encapsulating packets associated with a
             flow into a tunnel (for example, VPN service, IPv6
             transition service demands on the network).

             Blocking, or dropping packets associated with a flow in
             (the edge of) the network element when the network security
             service is aware of the attack (for example, SAVI service,
             Anti-DoS service demands on the network).

             Configure and dynamically reconfigure data centers to the
             steer and reroute traffic associated with a specific flow.

             Configure and dynamically reconfigure data centers to
             change priorities of different types of traffic associated
             with a specific flow.

             logging the traffic associated with a flow for network
             security service, optimization of the traffic based on the
             IETF ALTO [ID.draft-ietf-alto-protocol].

             Other actions defined by the administrator.

      2.  if required updates all databases, see Section 2.3.1.8 of
          [ID.farrkingel-pce-abno-architecture].

      3.  Uses existing network management and signaling protocols, i2rs
          [I2RS], SFC [SFC], NETCONF [NETCONF], NFVcon, etc., to request
          the implementation of the changes into the network.

   o  ABPD Network Management Interface: this functional block provides
      the interface with existing network management, i2rs, SFC,
      NETCONF, NFVcon, etc. protocols to request and negotiate the
      implementation of the changes into the network configuration.

   o  ABPD -NMAA interface: this functional block is used to support the 
      communication between NMAA and the ABDP. Note that a candidate 
      signaling protocol that can be used for the support of this 
      interface is an enhanced NSIS protocol engine.

   The definition of the network management policies is out of the APONF
   scope.

   These application-based policy models can meet the application's
   demands on the communication network and map these demands to network
   management policies that can be understood by the communication
   network.

6.  Network Elements

   The Network Element (NE) handles incoming packets based on the policy
   information communicated with the ABPD block and makes corresponding
   policy enforcement, which is based on existing network management
   policies, see Section 5.

   A NE may be a physical entity or a virtual entity and is locally
   managed, whether via CLI, SNMP, or NeTConf.  Examples of NEs can
   include:

   o  A router that has an extended function module.  The extended
      module handles incoming packets basing on the flow table of the
      module.

   o  A server that runs vRouter or vSwitch.

   o  A CGN that runs NAT, Tunnel En/De-capsulation functions.

   o  A virtual network function entity.

7.  The APONF Interface

   This APONF Interface/Protocol, needs to be specified by the APONF
   effort and is used to support the communication between the NMAA
   entity and the ABPD entity.  Several signaling protocols can be used 
   for this purpose. 
   One possible candidate signaling protocol is the IETF Next Steps in 
   Signaling (NSIS) protocol. In this case the NSIS protocol may be 
   extended in two ways to support this interface, see
   [ID.karagiannis-aponf-problem-statement]:

   1.  Extend NSIS GIST [RFC5971] in such a way that it can be used for
       off-path support;

   2.  Specify a new signaling protocol (NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol),
       similar to the NAT/Firewall NSLP [RFC5973] that can be applied
       and support the APONF use cases.  This signaling protocol is
       denoted as APONF NSLP.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security is a key aspect of any protocol that allows state
   installation and extracting of detailed configuration states.  More
   investigation remains to fully define the security requirements, such
   as authorization and authentication levels.


9.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA considerations.
