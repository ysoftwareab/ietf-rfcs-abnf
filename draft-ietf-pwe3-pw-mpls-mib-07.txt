1. Introduction 

  This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base 
  (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet 
  community. In particular, it defines a MIB module which can be
  used to manage pseudo wire (PW) services transmitted over 
  different types of MPLS packet Switched Network (PSN) 
  tunnels. 

  The general PW-STD-MIB module [PWMIB] defines the global parameters
  for PWs, regardless of underlying PSN or emulated service type. 
  This document describes the MIB objects that define pseudo wire 
  association to the MPLS PSN, in a way that is not specific to the
  carried service.
   
  Together, [RFC3814] and [RFC3813], describe the modeling of an MPLS 
  Tunnel, and a Tunnel's underlying cross-connects. The defined MIB 
  support MPLS-TE as a PSN, Non-TE MPLS PSN (an outer tunnel created 
  by The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC3036] or manually), 
  and MPLS PW label only (no outer tunnel). 

2. Terminology 

  This document adopts the definitions, acronyms and mechanisms
  described in [RFC3985]. Unless otherwise stated, the mechanisms of
  [RFC3985] apply and will not be re-described here.

  The terms "Outbound" and "Inbound" in this MIB module are based on 
  the common practice in the MPLS standards, i.e. "outbound" are 
  toward the PSN. However, where these terms are used in an object 
  name, the object description clarifies the exact packet direction 
  to prevent confusion with these terms in other documents. 
   
  "PSN Tunnel" is a general term indicating a virtual connection 
  between the two PWE3 edge devices. Each tunnel may potentially 
  carry multiple PWs inside. In the scope of this document, it is 
  MPLS tunnel.

Internet Draft                PW-MPLS-STD-MIB               July 2005


   
  This document uses terminology from the document describing the 
  MPLS architecture [RFC3031] for MPLS PSN. A Label Switched Path 
  (LSP) is modeled as described in [RFC3813] and [RFC3814] via 
  a series of cross-connects through 1 or more Label switching 
  routers (LSR). 
   
  In MPLS PSN, a PW connection typically uses a PW Label within a 
  Tunnel Label [PWCNTRL]. Multiple pseudo wires each with a unique PW 
  Label can share the same Tunnel. For PW transport over MPLS, the 
  Tunnel Label is known as the "outer" Label, while the PW Label is 
  known as the "inner" Label. An exception to this is with adjacent 
  LSRs or the use of PHP. In this case, there is an option for PWs to 
  connect directly without an outer Label. 
   
3. The Internet-Standard Management Framework  
      
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].    

4.  PWE3 MIB modules Architecture 
     
    The MIB structure for defining a PW service is composed from three 
    types of MIB modules. 
     
    The first type is the PW MIB module, which configures general 
    parameters of the PW that are common to all types of emulated 
    services and PSN types. 
     
    The second type of modules is PSN type specific module. There is a 
    different module for each type of PSN. These modules associate the 
    PW with one or more "tunnels" that carry the service over the PSN. 
    These modules are defined in other documents.
     
    The third type of modules is service-specific module, which is 
    emulated signal type dependent. These modules are defined in other 
    documents. 
     
    [PWTC] defines some of the object types used in these modules.

4.1 PW-MPLS-STD-MIB Module Usage 
   
    - The PW table (pwTable) in [PWMIB] is used for all PW types 
    (ATM, FR, Ethernet, SONET, etc.). This table contains high level 
    generic parameters related to the PW creation. The operator or the 
    agent for each PW service creates a row. 
   
    - If the PSN type in pwTable is MPLS, the agent creates a row in 
    the MPLS specific parameters table (pwMplsVcTable) in this module, 

    which contain MPLS specific parameters such as EXP bits handling 
    and outer tunnel configuration.  
     
    - The operator configures the association to the desired MPLS 
    tunnel (require for MPLS TE tunnels or manually configured PWs) 
    through the pwMplsTeOutbaoundTable. For LDP based outer tunnel, 
    there is no need for manula configuration since there is only a 
    single tunnel toward the peer. 
     
  - The agent creates rows in the MPLS mapping table in order to 
  allow quick retrieval of information based on the tunnel indexes.  
   
  The relation to the MPLS network is by configuration of the edge 
  LSR only - that is to say, the LSR providing the PW function. Since 
  Tunnels are uni-directional, a pair of tunnels must exist (one for 
  inbound, one for outbound). The following graphic depicts a VC that 
  originates and terminates at LSR-M. It uses LSPs A and B formed by 
  Tunnels Ax and Bx continuing through LSR-N to LSR-P. The 
  concatenations of Tunnels create the LSPs. Note: 'X' denotes a 
  Tunnel's cross-connect.

  The PW-MPLS-MIB supports three options for MPLS network: 
   
  - In the MPLS-TE case, Tunnel A1 and B1 are created via the MPLS-TE 
  MIB [RFC3814]. The tunnels are associated to the PW by the (4) 
  indexes that uniquely identify the Tunnel at the TE-MIB. 

  - In the Non TE case, Tunnel A1 and B1 are either manually 
  configured or set up with LDP. The tunnels are associated to the PW 
  by the XC index in the MPLS-LSR-MIB [RFC3813]. 
   
  - In the PW label only case, there is no outer tunnel on top of the 
  PW label. This case is useful in case of adjacent PEs in manual 
  configuration mode. Note that when LSR-N acts as PHP for the outer 
  tunnel label, there are still entries for the outer tunnel in the 
  relevant MPLS MIB modules.  
   
  A combination of MPLS-TE outer tunnel(s) and LDP outer tunnel for 
  the same PW is allowed through the pwMplsOutboundTunnel. The 
  current tunnel that is used to forward traffic is indicated in the 
  object pwMplsOutboundTunnelTypeInUse. 
   
  The PW MPLS MIB module reports through the inbound table the XC 
  entry in the LDP-STD_MIB of the PW that were signaled through LDP. 
   
  This MIB module assumes that a single PW can be associated to one 
  MPLS-TE tunnel at a time. This tunnel may be composed of multiple 
  instances (i.e. LSP), each represented by a separate instance 
  index. The current active LSP is reported through this MIB module. 
   
  It is worth noting that inbound (tunnel originated in the remote 
  PE) mapping is nor configured nor reported through the PW MPLS MIB 
  module since the local PE does not know the inbound association 
  between specific PW and MPLS tunnels.

          indexing of a TE tunnel head-end are used as in  
          MPLS-TE-STD-MIB are to be configured, and the tunnel  
          instance indicates the LSP that is currently in use for  
          forwarding the traffic. 
   
          In case of signaled Non-TE MPLS (an outer tunnel label  
          assigned by LDP) the table points to the XC entry in the  
          LSR-STD-MIB. If the Non-TE MPLS tunnel is manually  
          configured, the operator configure the XC pointer to this 
          tunnel. 
   
          In case of PW label only (no outer tunnel) the ifIndex of  
          the port to carry the PW is configured here.  
           
          It is possible to associate a PW to one TE tunnel head-end  
          and a non-TE tunnel together. An indication in this table  
          will report the currently active one, In addition, in the  
          TE case the table reports the active tunnel instance  
          (i.e. the specific LSP in use).

6. Security Considerations 
   
  It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for 
  monitoring of PW capable PEs.  This MIB module can also be used for 
  configuration of certain objects, and anything that can be 
  configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially 
  disastrous results. 
      
  There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
  with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
  objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
  environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
  environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
  network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their

  sensitivity/vulnerability: 
   
     o    the pwMplsTable, pwMplsNonTeMappingTable and 
          pwMplsTeMappingTable collectively contain objects to  
          provision PW over MPLS tunnels.  Unauthorized access to  
          objects in these tables, could result in disruption of  
          traffic on the network.  The use of stronger mechanisms  
          such as SNMPv3 security should be considered where  
          possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used  
          with any v3 agent which implements this MIB module.   
          Administrators should consider whether read access to these  
          objects should be allowed, since read access may be  
          undesirable under certain circumstances. 
   
  Some of the readable objects in this MIB module "i.e., objects with 
  a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible" may be considered sensitive 
  or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important 
  to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and 
  possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
  them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects 
  and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
   
     o    the pwMplsTable, pwMplsNonTeMappingTable,  
          pwMplsTeMappingTable and pwMplsOutboundTable  
          collectively show the PW over MPLS association.   
          If an Administrator does not want to reveal this 
          information, then these tables should be 
          considered sensitive/vulnerable. 
   
  SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. 
  Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec", 
  even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
  allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the 
  objects in this MIB module. 
   
  It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
  as provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8", 
  including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for 
  authentication and privacy". 
   
  Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
  RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
  enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
  responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
  instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access 
  to the objects only to those principals "users" that have 
  legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them.

  that namespace.  New assignments can only be made via a Standards 
  Action as specified in [RFC2434].

  IANA is requested to make a MIB OID assignment under the 
  pwMIB branch as specified in section 11.1.
