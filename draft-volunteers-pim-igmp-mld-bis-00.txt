Abstract

   The PIM WG intends to progress IGMPv3 and MLDv2 from Proposed
   Standards to Internet Standards.  This document describes the
   motivation, procedures and questions proposed for a survey of
   operators, vendors and implementors of IGMPv3 and MLDv2.  The
   objective of the survey is to collate information to help the PIM WG
   progress these protocols to Internet Standards.

1.  Introduction

   Internet Group Management Protocol Version 3 (IGMPv3) [RFC3376] and
   Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6 [RFC3810] are
   currently Proposed Standards.  Given the fact that multiple
   independent implementations of these protocols exist and they have
   been successfully and widely used operationally, the PIM WG is keen
   to progress these protocols to Internet Standards.  In order to
   facilitate this effort, it is critical to establish if there are

Internet-Draft           IGMPv3 and MLDv2 Survey              March 2019


   features specified in [RFC3376] and [RFC3810] that have not been
   widely used and also to determine any interoperability issues that
   have arisen from using the protocols.

   Following approach taken for PIM-SM, documented in [RFC7063], the PIM
   WG has decided that conducting a comprehensive survey on
   implementations and deployment of IGMPv3 and MLDv2 will provide
   valuable information to facilitate their progression to Internet
   Standard.

   This document describes the procedures proposed for conducting the
   survey and introduces the proposed questions.

2.  Procedures Followed

2.1.  Methodology

   The PIM WG Chairs will officially kick off the survey and distribute
   the questionnaire and pertinent information through appropriate
   forums, aiming to ensure the survey reaches as wide an audience as
   possible.

2.2.  Intended Recipients of Questionnaire

   1.  Network operators

   2.  Router vendors

   3.  Switch vendors

   4.  Host implementors

2.3.  Processing of Responses

   Responses received will remain confidential.  Only the aggregated
   results will be published and so it will be impossible to identify
   the contributions by individual operators, vendors or implementors.
   Furthermore, an option to submit the completed questionnaire
   anonymously will be available.

       the implementation challenging?
