   Supporting Explicit Inclusion or Exclusion of Abstract Nodes for a
 Subset of P2MP Destinations in Path Computation Element Communication
                            Protocol (PCEP).
              draft-dhody-pce-pcep-p2mp-per-destination-12

Abstract

   The ability to determine paths of point-to-multipoint (P2MP)
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) is one the key
   requirements for Path Computation Element (PCE).  The PCEP has been
   extentded for intra and inter domain path computation via PCE(s) for
   P2MP TE LSP.

   This document describes the motivation and PCEP extension for
   explicitly specifying abstract nodes for inclusion or exclusion for a
   subset of destinations during P2MP path computation via PCE(s).

1.  Introduction

   The PCE architecture is defined in [RFC4655].  [RFC5862] lay out the
   requirements for PCEP to support P2MP path computation.
   [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis] describe an extension to PCEP to compute
   optimal constrained intra-domain (G)MPLS P2MP TE LSPs.  [RFC7334]
   describes the mechanism for inter-domain P2MP path computation.

   Further [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis] describes mechanism to specify a
   list of nodes that can be used as branch nodes or a list of nodes
   that cannot be used as branch nodes via Branch Node Capability (BNC)
   object.  The BNC object is used to specify which nodes have the
   capability to act as a branch nodes or which nodes lack the
   capabilty.  It supports IPv4 and IPv6 prefix sub-objects only.

   This document explains the need to add the capability to explicitly
   specify any abstract nodes (not just nodes with branch node
   capabiltiy) for inclusion or exclusion for a subset of destinations.

   [RFC7334] describes the core-tree procedure to compute inter-domain
   P2MP tree.  It assumes that, due to deployment and commercial
   limitations, the sequence of domains for a path (the path domain
   tree) will be known in advance.  For a group of destination which
   belong to a particular destination domain, the domain-sequence needs
   to be encoded separately as described in [RFC7897].  The mechanism,
   as described in this document, of explicitly specifying abstract
   nodes for inclusion or exclusion for a subset of destinations can be
   used for this purpose, where abstract nodes are domains.

   Stateful PCEs are shown to be helpful in many application scenarios,
   in both MPLS and GMPLS networks, as illustrated in [RFC8051].  These
   scenarios apply equally to P2P and P2MP TE LSPs.  [RFC8231] provides
   the fundamental extensions needed for stateful PCE to support general
   functionality for P2P TE LSP.  [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]
   provides the an extensions needed for stateful PCE-initiated P2P TE
   LSP.  Complementarily, [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp] focuses on
   the extensions that are necessary in order for the deployment of
   stateful PCEs to support P2MP TE LSPs.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   IRO:  Include Route Object.

   PCC:  Path Computation Client: any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Protocol.

   P2MP:  Point-to-Multipoint

   P2P:  Point-to-Point

   RRO:  Record Route Object

   RSVP:  Resource Reservation Protocol

   TE LSP:  Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path.

   XRO:  Exclude Route Object.

3.  Motivation

3.1.  Domain Sequence Tree in Inter Domain P2MP Path Computation

   [RFC7334] describes the core-tree procedure for inter-domain path
   computation.  The procedure assumes that the sequence of domains for
   a path (the path domain tree) will be known in advance due to
   deployment and commercial limitations (e.g., inter-AS peering
   agreements).

   In the Figure 1 below, D1 is the root domain; D4, D5 and D6 are the
   destination domains.  The ingress is Ro in domain D1; egresses are M,
   N in Domain D4; R, S in Domain D5; and U, V in Domain D6.

                     Figure 1: Domain Topology Example

   The domain tree can be represented as a series of domain sequences:

      Domain D1, Domain D3, Domain D6

      Domain D1, Domain D3, Domain D5

      Domain D1, Domain D2, Domain D4

   Since destinations in different destination domain will have
   different domain sequence within the domain tree, it requires
   following encoding that binds destinations to a particular domain
   sequence.

   o  Destination M and N: D1-D2-D4

   o  Destination R and S: D1-D3-D5

   o  Destination U and V: D1-D3-D6

   An extension in P2MP Path Computation request is needed to support
   this.  (Refer Section 4.2)

   The abstract nodes MAY include (but not limited to) domain subobjects
   - AS number and IGP Area as described in [RFC7897].

3.2.  Explicit inclusion or exclusion of abstract nodes

   [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis] describes four possible types of leaves in
   a P2MP request encoded in P2MP END-POINTS object.

   o  New leaves to add

   o  Old leaves to remove

   o  Old leaves whose path can be modified/reoptimized

   o  Old leaves whose path must be left unchanged

   [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis] only allows to encode a list of nodes that
   have (or have not) the branch node capability by using the Branch
   Node Capability (BNC) Object.  This object apply to all destinations
   (old and new) in the P2MP tree.

   For an existing P2MP tree with an overloaded branch node, when adding
   a set of new leaves, administrator may want to exclude that
   particular branch node to balance the final P2MP tree.  This cannot
   be achieved via the BNC object but by explicitly excluding a
   particular node or including a different node, for the P2MP END-
   POINTS object for new leaves only.

   Administrator at the Ingress can exert stronger control by providing
   explicit inclusion or exclusion of any abstract nodes (not limited to
   specifying nodes with branch node capability) for a group (subset) of
   destinations and not all destinations.

4.1.  Objective

   [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis] and [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp]
   defines Request Message Format and Objects, along with <end-point-
   rro-pair-list>.  This section introduce the use of <IRO> and <XRO>
   which are added to the <end-point-rro-pair-list>.

   To allow abstract nodes to be explicitly included or excluded for a
   subset of destinations (encoded in one <END-POINTS> object), changes
   are made as shown below.

   The abstract node (encoded as subobject in <IRO> and <XRO>) MAY be an
   absolute hop, IP-Prefix, AS or IGP Area.  The subobjects are
   described in [RFC3209], [RFC3477], [RFC4874] and [RFC7897].

   Note that one P2MP Path request can have multiple <END-POINTS>
   objects and each P2MP <END-POINTS> object may have multiple
   destinations, the <pce-list>, <IRO> and <XRO> is applied for all
   destinations in one such P2MP <END-POINTS> object.

4.2.  Request Message Format

   The format of PCReq message, with [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp] as
   base, is modified as follows:

   From [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis] and [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp],
   usage of <end-point-rro-pair-list> is changed to <end-point-pce-iro-
   xro-rro-pair-list> in this document.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis] describes Branch Node Capability (BNC)
   Object which is different from the use of <IRO> and <XRO> to specify
   inclusion/exclusion of abstract nodes for a subset of destinations as
   described here.

4.3.  Report Message Format

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp] defines a report message format and
   objects.  This document extends the message to allow explicit
   inclusion and exclusion of abstract nodes for a group of
   destinations.

   [RFC5440].  <actual_path> is represented by the RRO, SERO object.

   The <end-point-intended-path-pair-list> is extended to add the IRO
   and XRO object for a group of destinations in the END-POINTS object.

4.4.  Backward Compatibility

   A legacy implementation that does not support explicit inclusion or
   exclusion of abstract nodes for a subset of P2MP destinations will
   act according to the procedures set out in [RFC5440], that is it will
   find the P2MP Path Request message out of order with respect to the
   format specified in [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp].

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no new IANA allocation in this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   PCEP security mechanisms as described in [RFC5440],
   [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis], [RFC7334] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp] are applicable for this document.

   The new explicit inclusion or exclusion of abstract nodes for a
   subset of P2MP destination defined in this document allow finer and
   more specific control of the path computed by a PCE.  Such control
   increases the risk if a PCEP message is intercepted, modified, or
   spoofed because it allows the attacker to exert control over the path
   that the PCE will compute or to make the path computation impossible.
   Therefore, the security techniques described in [RFC5440],
   [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis], [RFC7334] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp] are considered more important.

   Note, however, that the route exclusion mechanisms also provide the
   operator with the ability to route around vulnerable parts of the
   network and may be used to increase overall network security.

7.  Manageability Considerations

7.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not add any new control
   function/policy requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis] and [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp].

7.2.  Information and Data Models

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new MIB
   requirements.

7.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp].

7.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis] and [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp].

7.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any requirements on
   other protocols in addition to those already listed in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis] and [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp].

7.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on network
   operations in addition to those already listed in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-rfc6006bis] and [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-p2mp].
