1.  Introduction

   Network operators need to know what is connected to their
   organization's networks so that they can properly manage those
   endpoints.  Endpoint management requires access to endpoint posture
   information, including endpoint identity, the identity of software
   installed on the endpoint, and the configuration of the endpoint.
   This information can be collected from different classes of endpoints
   over different protocols and using different data models.  PANIC will
   identify a standardized solution to collect posture information for
   network devices, and allow that information to be shared with
   authorized users and devices on the network supporting security
   automation.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Components

   The solution will consist of the following components:

   Network Device:  Endpoints such as routers, switches, firewalls.
      Virtualized network functions are currently be considered in
      scope.

   Posture Server:  Collects information from the network device.
      Receives information via pushes, and requests information via
      pulls.

   Data Repository:  Stores the information collected by the posture
      server from the network device.

3.  PANIC Solution Requirements

   The solution will meet the following requirements:

   Data Push Functionality:  Network devices will push information to a
      designated location.  Data pushes will be event driven.  PANIC
      will identify what data should be pushed from the network device,
      and what events will trigger a push.

   Data Pull Functionality:  A Posture Server will pull information from
      a network device.  Data pulls will be driven by requests to the
      server.  PANIC will identify what data should be pulled from the
      network device, and how requests for the server to pull will be
      made.

   Secure Transport of Data:  Data between the network device and the
      Posture Server will be protected in transit by a protocol that
      provides authorization and authentication.  PANIC will identify
      the protocols that can be used for transport of posture
      information.

   Secure Storage of Data:  Network device data reported to a posture
      server will be stored in a data repository.  This data can be used
      to support numerous security functions on the network; therefore,
      this repository should be accessible by (and only by) authorized
      users and devices.  PANIC will identify requirements for a
      centralized data repository.

   Information Requirements for Network Device Management:  PANIC will
      identify a minimal set of information necessary to manage network
      devices and to support network security functions including
      configuration and vulnerability management.  Additional

      information may also be used through extension mechanisms
      identified by PANIC.

   Standardized Data Model:  Network device data will be expressed in a
      standardized data model that enables use and reuse of the data.
      PANIC will identify available data models for the expression of
      required information and the models used for a given exchange of
      posture.

   Note: Use of [RFC2119] text is omitted at this point.  More
   discussion is needed around these requirements.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   The solution described by this document provides a mechanism to
   gather network device posture into a centralized datastore.
   Discussion is needed here about the need to protect such an
   information collection from unauthorized access or disclosure.
   Discussion is also needed here about privacy considerations around
   how the endpoint devices are identified when posture is gathered.
