1. Introduction 

   The primary purpose of the Internet IP Address and AS Number 
   Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) system is to improve 
   routing security.  As part of this system, a mechanism is needed to
   allow entities to verify that an AS has been given permission by an
   IP address block holder to advertise routes to one or more prefixes 
   within that block.  A ROA provides this function.

   A ROA is a digitally signed object that makes use of Cryptographic 
   Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC3852] as a standard encapsulation format.  
   CMS was chosen to take advantage of existing open source software 
   available for processing messages in this format. 

2. Basic Format 

   Using CMS syntax, a ROA is a type of signed-data object.  The general 
   format of a CMS object is: 

      ContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE { 
        contentType ContentType, 
        content [0] EXPLICIT ANY DEFINED BY contentType } 
    
      ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER 
    
   As a ROA is a signed-data object, it uses the corresponding OID, 
   1.2.840.113549.1.7.2. [RFC3852] 

2.1. Signed-Data Content Type 

   According to the CMS standard, the signed-data content type shall 
   have ASN.1 type SignedData: 

      SignedData ::= SEQUENCE { 
        version CMSVersion, 
        digestAlgorithms DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers, 
        encapContentInfo EncapsulatedContentInfo, 
        certificates [0] IMPLICIT CertificateSet OPTIONAL, 
        crls [1] IMPLICIT RevocationInfoChoices OPTIONAL, 
        signerInfos SignerInfos } 
    
      DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers ::= SET OF DigestAlgorithmIdentifier 
    
      SignerInfos ::= SET OF SignerInfo 
    

2.1.1. version 

   The version is the syntax version number.  It MUST be 3, 
   corresponding to the signerInfo structure having version number 3.   

2.1.2. digestAlgorithms 

   The digestAlgorithms set MUST include only SHA-256, the OID for which 
   is 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1. [RFC4055] It MUST NOT contain any other 
   algorithms.

Internet-Draft     Route Origin Attestation Profile           July 2007 
    

2.1.3. encapContentInfo 

   encapContentInfo is the signed content, consisting of a content type 
   identifier and the content itself. 

      EncapsulatedContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE { 
        eContentType ContentType, 
        eContent [0] EXPLICIT OCTET STRING OPTIONAL } 
    
      ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER 
    
2.1.3.1. eContentType 

   The ContentType for a ROA is defined as routeOriginAttestation and 
   has the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.24. 

      id-smime OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) 
   rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) 16 } 
    
      id-ct OBJECT INDENTIFIER ::= { id-smime 1 } 
    
      routeOriginAttestion OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ct 24 } 
    
2.1.3.2. eContent 

   The content of a ROA identifies a single AS that has been authorized 
   by the address space holder to originate routes and a list of one or 
   more IP address prefixes that will be advertised.  If the address 
   space holder needs to authorize multiple ASes to advertise the same 
   set of address prefixes, the holder issues multiple ROAs, one per AS 
   number. A ROA is formally defined as: 

      RouteOriginAttestation ::= SEQUENCE { 
         version [0] INTEGER DEFAULT 0, 
         asID  ASID, 
         exactMatch BOOLEAN  
         ipAddrBlocks ROAIPAddrBlocks } 
     
      ASID ::= INTEGER 
       
      ROAIPAddrBlocks ::= SEQUENCE of ROAIPAddressFamily 
       
      ROAIPAddressFamily ::= SEQUENCE { 
         addressFamily OCTET STRING (SIZE (2..3)), 
         addresses SEQUENCE OF IPAddress } 
    
      IPAddress ::= BIT STRING

Internet-Draft     Route Origin Attestation Profile           July 2007 
    

2.1.3.2.1. version 

   The version number of the RouteOriginAttestation MUST be 0. 

2.1.3.2.2. asID 

   The asID field contains the AS number that is authorized to originate 
   routes to the given IP address prefixes. 

2.1.3.2.3. requireExactMatch 

   A value of TRUE in the requireExactMatch field indicates that the AS 
   is authorized to originate routes only for the prefix(es) specified 
   in the ROA, not for any more specific prefix(es). A value of FALSE in 
   the requireExactMatch field indicates that the AS is authorized to 
   originate routes not only for prefix(es) listed in the ROA, but also 
   for any more specific (longer) prefix(es). 

2.1.3.2.4. ipAddrBlocks 

   The ipAddrBlocks field encodes the set of IP address prefixes to 
   which the AS is authorized to originate routes. Note that the syntax 
   here is more restrictive than that used in the IP Address Delegation 
   extension defined in RFC 3779. That extension can represent arbitrary 
   address ranges, whereas ROAs need to represent only prefixes. 

   Within the ROAIPAddressFamily structure, addressFamily contains the 
   Address Family Identifier (AFI) of an IP address family. This 
   specification only supports IPv4 and IPv6. Therefore, addressFamily 
   MUST be either 0001 or 0002. The addresses field represents prefixes 
   as a sequence of type IPAddress. (See [RFC3779] for more details). 

2.1.4. certificates 

   The certificates field MAY be included.  If so, it MUST contain only 
   the end entity certificate needed to validate this ROA. This 
   certificate should be present only if the ROA is being transmitted to 
   a relying party.  Thus in the initial use of ROAs, where they are 
   being made available to relying parties via a repository system, this 
   certificate SHOULD be omitted. 

2.1.5. crls 

   The crls field MUST be omitted.

2.1.6. signerInfos 

   SignerInfo is defined under CMS as: 

      SignerInfo ::= SEQUENCE { 
        version CMSVersion, 
        sid SignerIdentifier, 
        digestAlgorithm DigestAlgorithmIdentifier, 
        signedAttrs [0] IMPLICIT SignedAttributes OPTIONAL, 
        signatureAlgorithm SignatureAlgorithmIdentifier, 
        signature SignatureValue, 
        unsignedAttrs [1] IMPLICIT UnsignedAttributes OPTIONAL } 
 
2.1.6.1. version 

   The version number MUST be 3, corresponding with the choice of 
   SubjectKeyIdentifier for the sid. 

2.1.6.2. sid 

   The sid is defined as: 

      SignerIdentifier ::= CHOICE { 
        issuerAndSerialNumber IssuerAndSerialNumber, 
        subjectKeyIdentifier [0] SubjectKeyIdentifier } 
    
   For a ROA, the sid MUST be a SubjectKeyIdentifier. 
    
2.1.6.3. digestAlgorithm 

   The digestAlgorithm MUST be SHA-256, the OID for which is 
   2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1. [RFC4055] 

2.1.6.4. signedAttrs 

   signedAttrs MUST be omitted. 

2.1.6.5. signatureAlgorithm 

   The signatureAlgorithm MUST be RSA (rsaEncryption), the OID for which 
   is 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1.

Internet-Draft     Route Origin Attestation Profile           July 2007 
    

2.1.6.6. signature 

   The signature value is defined as: 
    
      SignatureValue ::= OCTET STRING 
    
   The signature characteristics are defined by the digest and signature 
algorithms. 

2.1.6.7. unsignedAttrs 

   unsignedAttrs MUST be omitted. 

3. ROA Validation 

   Before a relying party can use a ROA to validate a routing 
   announcement, the relying party must use the resource PKI to validate 
   the ROA. To do this the relying party performs the following steps: 

   1. Verify that the ROA syntax complies with this specification. In 
      particular, verify the following: 

       a. The contentType of the CMS object is SignedData (OID 
          1.2.840.113549.1.7.2) 

       b. The version of the SignedData object is 3. 

       c. The digestAlgorithm in the SignedData object is SHA-256 (OID 
          2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1). 

       d. The crls field in the SignedData object is omitted. 

       e. The eContentType in the EncapsulatedContentInfo is 
          routeOriginAttestation (OID 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.24) 

       f. The version of the RouteOriginAttestation is 0. 

       g. The addressFamily in the ROAIPAddressFamily is either IPv4 or 
          IPv6 (0001 and 0002, respectively). 

       h. The version of the SignerInfo is 3. 

       i. The digestAlgorithm in the SignerInfo object is SHA-256 (OID 
          2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1). 

       j. The signatureAlgorithm in the SignerInfo object is RSA (OID 
          1.2.840.113549.1.1.1).

Internet-Draft     Route Origin Attestation Profile           July 2007 
    

       k. The signedAttrs field in the SignerInfo object is omitted. 

       l. The unsignedAttrs field in the SignerInfo object is omitted.   

   2. Obtain an EE certificate that has a Subject Key Identifier (SKI) 
      that matches the sid field of the SignerInfo object. This 
      certificate may be obtained from the certificates field of the 
      SignedData object (if present), the resource PKI repository 
      system, or a local cache. 

   3. Use the public key in the EE certificate to verify the signature 
      on the ROA. 

   4. Verify that the EE certificate has an IP Address Delegation 
      extension [RFC3779] and that the IP address prefix(es) in that 
      extension exactly matches the IP address prefix(es) in the ROA. 

   5. Verify that the EE certificate is a valid end-entity certificate 
      in the resource PKI by constructing a valid certificate path to a 
      trust anchor. (See [RESCERT] for more details.) 

   Note that requiring an exact match between the IP address prefix(es) 
   in a ROA and the IP address prefix(es) in the corresponding EE 
   certificate does not place any limitations on ROA use. Indeed, since 
   each EE certificate in the resource RPKI architecture is used to 
   verify only a single ROA, it is natural to have the IP address 
   prefixes in the certificate match those in the corresponding ROA. 
   When the issuer of a ROA does not require an exact match between the 
   IP address prefix(es) in the ROA and the prefix(es) advertised by the 
   AS when it originates routes for the prefix(es), the issuer sets the 
   exactMatch flag in the ROA to FALSE.  

4. Security Considerations 

   There is no assumption of confidentiality for the data in a ROA; it 
   is anticipated that ROAs will be stored in repositories that are 
   accessible to all ISPs, and perhaps to all Internet users. There is 
   no explicit authentication associated with a ROA, since the PKI used 
   for ROA validation provides authorization but not authentication. 
   Although the ROA is a signed, application layer object, there is no 
   intent to convey non-repudiation via a ROA.  
    
   The purpose of a ROA is to convey authorization for an AS to 
   originate a route to the prefix(es) in the ROA. Thus the integrity of 
   a ROA must be established. The ROA makes use of the CMS signed 
   message format for integrity, and thus inherits the security 
   considerations associated with that data structure. The right of the

   ROA signer to authorize the target AS to originate routes to the 
   prefix(es) is established through use of the address space and AS 
   number PKI described in [ARCH]. Specifically one must verify the 
   signature on the ROA using an X.509 certificate issued under this 
   PKI, and check that the prefix(es) in the ROA match those in the 
   address space extension in the certificate.  

5. IANA Considerations 

   None.
