throughput = window size / RTT

    Therefore, using the maximum window size of 65,535 bytes and a
    geosynchronous satellite channel RTT of 560 ms [Kru95] the maximum
    throughput is limited to:

throughput = 65,535 bytes / 560 ms = 117,027 bytes/second

    Therefore, a single standard TCP connection cannot fully utilize,
    for example, T1 rate (approximately 192,000 bytes/second) GSO
    satellite channels.  However, TCP has been extended to support
    larger windows [JBB92].  The window scaling options outlined in
    [JBB92] should be used in satellite environments, as well as the
    companion algorithms PAWS (Protection Against Wrapped Sequence
    space) and RTTM (Round-Trip Time Measurements).
    
    It should be noted that for a satellite link shared among many
    flows, large windows may not be necessary.  For instance, two
    long-lived TCP connections each using a window of 65,535 bytes, as
    in the above example, can fully utilize a T1 GSO satellite channel.
    
    Using large windows often requires both client and server
    applications or TCP stacks to be hand tuned (usually by an expert)
    to utilize large windows.  Research into operating system mechanisms
    that are able to adjust the buffer capacity as dictated by the
    current network conditions is currently underway [SMM98].  This will
    allow stock TCP implementations and applications to better utilize
    the capacity provided by the underlying network.
