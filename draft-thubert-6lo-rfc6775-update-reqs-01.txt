1.  Introduction

   A number of use cases, including the Industrial Internet, require a
   large scale deployment of sensors that can not be realized with wires
   and is only feasible over wireless Low power and Lossy Network (LLN)
   technologies.  When simpler hub-and-spoke topologies are not
   sufficient for the expected throughput and density, mesh networks
   must be deployed, which implies the concepts of hosts and routers,
   whether operated at Layer-2 or Layer-3.

   The IETF has designed the LLN host-to-router and router-to-router
   protocol that supports address assignment and the router-to-router
   protocol that supports reachability across Route-Over LLNs in
   different Areas.  It was clear for both efforts that the scalability
   requirements could only be met with IPv6 [RFC2460], and there is no
   fundamental contradiction between those protocols to that regard.

   While DHCPv6 is still a viable option in LLNs, the new IETF standard
   that supports address assignment specifically for LLNs is 6LoWPAN ND,
   the Neighbor Discovery Optimization for Low-power and Lossy Networks
   [RFC6775].  6LoWPAN ND was designed as a stand-alone mechanism
   separately from its IETF routing counterpart, the IPv6 Routing
   Protocol for Low power and  Lossy Networks [RFC6550] (RPL), and the
   interaction between the 2 protocols was not defined.

   The 6TiSCH WG is now considering an architecture [I-D.ietf-6tisch-
   architecture] whereby a 6LowPAN ND host could connect to the Internet
   via a RPL Network, but this requires additions to the protocol to
   support mobility and reachability.

   At the same time, new work at 6MAN on Efficiency aware IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery Optimizations [I-D.chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-efficient-nd]
   suggests that 6LoWPAN ND can be extended to other types of networks
   on top of the Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) for which it was
   already defined.  The value of such extension is especially apparent
   in the case of mobile wireless devices, to reduce the multicast
   operations that are related to classical ND ([RFC4861], [RFC4862])

   and plague the wireless medium.  In this context also, there is a
   need for additions to the protocol.

   The"Optimistic Duplicate Address Detection"  [RFC4429](ODAD)
   specification details how an address can be used before a Duplicate
   Address Detection (DAD) is complete, and insists that an address that
   is TENTATIVE should not be associated to a Source Link-Layer Address
   Option in a Neighbor Solicitation message.  As we expect the 6LoWPAN
   ND protocol for a more general use, it can make sense to keep
   respecting that rule, which is another change to the specification.

   This document proposes a limited evolution to [RFC6775] so as to
   allow operation of a 6LoWPAN ND node as a leaf to a RPL network, and
   enable a more generalized use of the formats therein outside of the
   strict LLN domain.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Readers are expected to be familiar with all the terms and concepts
   that are discussed in "Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6"
   [RFC4861], "IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration" [RFC4862],
   "IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs):
   Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and Goals" [RFC4919],
   Neighbor Discovery Optimization for Low-power and Lossy Networks
   [RFC6775] and "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4
   Networks" [RFC4944].

   Additionally, this document uses terminology from 6TiSCH [I-D.ietf-
   6tisch-terminology] and ROLL [I-D.ietf-roll-terminology].

3.  Suggested operations

   The 6TiSCH architecture expects that a 6LoWPAN device can connect as
   a leaf to a RPL network, where the leaf support is the minimal
   functionality to connect as a host to a RPL network without the need
   to participate to the full routing protocol.  The support of leaf can
   be implemented as a minor increment to 6LoWPAN ND, with the
   additional capability to carry a sequence number that is used to
   track the movements of the device, and optionally some information
   about the RPL topology that this device will join.

   The scope of the 6TiSCH Architecture is a Backbone Link that
   federates multiple LLNs as a single IPv6 Multi-Link Subnet.  Each LLN

   in the subnet is anchored at a Backbone Router (6BBR).  The Backbone
   Routers interconnect the LLNs over the Backbone Link and emulate that
   the LLN nodes are present on the Backbone by proxy-ND operations.  An
   LLN node can move freely from an LLN Route-Over mesh anchored at a
   Backbone Router to another anchored at same or a different Backbone
   Router inside the Multi-Link Subnet and conserve its addresses.

   The root of the RPL topology is logically separated from the 6BBR
   that is used to connect the RPL topology to the backbone.  Efficient
   ND is a perfect interface for the RPL root to register the LLN node
   in its topology to the 6BBR for proxy operations.  It results that
   the signalling would start at the leaf node with 6LoWPAN ND, then
   would be carried over RPL to the RPL root, and then with Efficient-ND
   to the 6BBR.  Efficient ND being an adaptation of 6LoWPAN ND, it
   makes sense to keep those two homogeneous in the way they use the
   source and the target addresses in the Neighbor Solicitation (NS)
   messages for registration, as well as in the options that they use
   for that process.

   As the network builds up, a node should start as a leaf to join the
   RPL network, and may later turn into a RPL router and eventually a
   6LR as well, so as to accept leaf nodes to recursively join the
   network.

3.1.  RPL Leaf Support in 6LoWPAN ND

   RPL needs a set of information in order to advertise a leaf node
   through a DAO message and establish reachability.

   At the bare minimum the leaf device must provide a sequence number
   that matches the RPL specification in section 7.  [I-D.chakrabarti-
   nordmark-6man-efficient-nd] section "4.1.  Address Registration
   Option" (ARO) already incorporates that addition with a new field in
   the option called the Transaction ID.

   If for some reason the node is aware of RPL topologies, then
   providing the RPL InstanceID for the instances to which the node
   wishes to participate would be a welcome addition.  In the absence of
   such information, the RPL router must infer the proper instanceID
   from external rules and policies.

   On the backbone, the InstanceID is expected to be mapped onto a
   VLANID. Neither WiFi nor Efficient ND do provide a mapping to
   VLANIDs, and it is unclear, when a wireless node attaches to a
   backbone where VLANs are defined, which VLAN the wireless device
   attaches to.  Considering that a VLAN is effectively the IP link on

Internet-Draft  Requirements for an update to 6LoWPAN ND       June 2014

   the backbone, adding the InstanceID to both specifications could be a
   welcome addition.

3.2.  registration Failures Due to Movement

   Registration to the 6LBR through DAR/DAC messages [RFC6775] may
   percolate slowly through an LLN mesh, and it might happen that in the
   meantime, the 6LoWPAN node moves and registers somewhere else.  Both
   RPL and 6LoWPAN ND lack the capability to indicate that the same node
   is registered elsewhere, so as to invalidate states down the
   deprecated path.

   In its current expression and functionality, 6LoWPAN ND considers
   that the registration is used for the purpose of DAD only as opposed
   to that of achieving reachability, and as long as the same node
   registers the IPv6 address, the protocol is functional.  In order to
   act as a RPL leaf registration protocol and achieve reachability, the
   device must use the same TID for all its concurrent registrations,
   and registrations with a past TID should be declined.  The state for
   an obsolete registration in the 6LR, as well as the RPL routers on
   the way, should be invalidated.  This can only be achieved with the
   addition of a new Status in the DAC message, and a new error/clean-up
   flow in RPL.

3.3.  Optimistic registration

   In their current incarnations, both 6LoWPAN ND and Efficient ND
   expect that the address being registered is the source of the NS(ARO)
   message and thus impose that a Source Link-Layer Address (SLLA)
   option be present in the message.  In the case of Efficient ND, this
   would cause the root of the RPL network to fake the source address of
   the packet when registering the leaf node to the 6BBR. .

   In any case, as long as the DAD process is not complete for the
   address used as source of the packet, it is a bad practice to
   advertise the SLLA, since this may corrupt the ND cache of the
   destination node, as discussed in the Optimistic DAD specification
   [RFC4429] regarding the TENTATIVE state.

   This may look like a chicken and an egg problem, but in fact 6LoWPAN
   ND acknowledges that the Link-Local Address that is based on an
   EUI-64 address of a LLN node may be autoconfigured without the need
   for DAD.  It results that the node could use that address as source
   to register all the addresses that are expected to be reachable
   through RPL, meaning either Global or Unique-Local Addresses.

   The suggested change is to register the target of the NS message, and
   use Target Link-Layer Address (TLLA) in the NS as opposed to the SLLA
   in order to install a Neighbor Cache Entry.  This would apply to both
   Efficient ND and 6LoWPAN ND in a very same manner, with the caveat
   that depending on the nature of the link between the 6LBR and the
   6BBR, the 6LBR may resort to classical ND or DHCPv6 to obtain the
   address that it uses to source the NS registration messages, whether
   for itself or on behalf of LLN nodes.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for an update to 6LoWPAN ND       June 2014


3.4.  RPL root vs.  6LBR

   6LoWPAN ND is unclear on how the 6LBR is discovered, and how the
   liveliness of the 6LBR is asserted over time.  On the other hand, the
   discovery and liveliness of the RPL root are obtained through the RPL
   protocol.

   When 6LoWPAN ND is coupled with RPL, it makes sense to collocate the
   6LBR functionality and that of the RPL root.  The DAR/DAC exchange
   becomes a preamble to the DAO messages that are used from then on to
   reconfirm the registration, thus eliminating a duplication of
   functionality between DAO and DAR messages.

4.  Suggested Changes to Protocol Elements

4.1.  ND Neighbor Solicitation (NS)

   The NS message used for registration should use a source address that
   respects the rules in [RFC6775], [RFC4861], and [RFC4429] for DAD.
   The SLLA Option may be present but only if the address passed DAD,
   and it is used to allow the 6LR to respond as opposed to as a
   registration mechanism.

   The address that is being registered is the target address in the NS
   message and the TLLA Option must be present.

4.2.  ND Router Advertisement (RA)

   [I-D.chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-efficient-nd] adds an 'E' bit in the
   Router Advertisement flag, as well as a new Registrar Address Option
   (RAO). These fields are probably pertinent to LLNs inclusion into a
   revised 6LoWPAN ND should be studied.

   There is some amount of duplication between the options in the RPL
   DIO [RFC6550] and the options in the ND RA messages.  At the same
   time, there are a number of options, including the 6LoWPAN Context
   Option (6CO) [RFC6775], the MTU and the SLLA Options [RFC4861]  that
   can only be found in the RA messages.  Considering that these options
   are useful for a joining node, the recommendation would be to
   associate the RA messages to the join beacon, and make them rare when
   the network is stable.  On the other hand, the DIO message is to be
   used as the propagated heartbeat of the RPL network and provide the
   sense of time and liveliness.

   RAs should also be issued and the information therein propagated when
   a change occurs in the information therein, such as a router or a
   prefix lifetime.

4.3.  RPL DODAG Information Object (DIO)

   If the RPL root serves as 6LBR, it makes sense to add at least a bit
   of information in the DIO to signal so.  A Registrar Address Option
   (RAO) may also be considered for addition.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for an update to 6LoWPAN ND       June 2014


4.4.  ND Enhanced Address Registration Option (EARO)

   This option is designed to be used with standard NS and NA messages
   between backbone Routers as well as between nodes and 6LRs over the
   LLN and between the 6LBR and the 6BBR over whatever IP link they use
   to communicate.

   The representation above is based on [I-D.chakrabarti-nordmark-6man-
   efficient-nd].  Only the proposed changes from that specification are
   discussed below but the expectation is that 6LoWPAN ND and Efficient
   ND converge on the ARO format.

   Status: 8-bit integer.  A new value of 3 is suggested to indicate a
      rejection due to an obsolete TID, typically an indication of a
      movement.

   RPLInstanceID: 8-bit integer.  This field is set to 0 when unused.
      Otherwise it contains the RPLInstanceID for which this address is
      registered, as specified in RPL [RFC6550], and discussed in
      particular in section 3.1.2.

   P: One bit flag.  Indicates that the address is to be redistributed
      to obtain reachability, e.g.  into the RPL protocol, or for ND
      proxy operation.

   N: One bit flag.  Set if the device moved.  If not set, the 6BBR will
      refrain from sending gratuitous NA(O) or other form of distributed
      ND cache clean-up over the backbone.  For instance, the flag
      should be reset after the DAD operation upon address formation.

5.  Security Considerations

   This specification expects that the link layer is sufficiently
   protected, either by means of physical or IP security for the
   Backbone Link or MAC sublayer cryptography.  In particular, it is
   expected that the LLN MAC provides secure unicast to/from the
   Backbone Router and secure broadcast from the Backbone Router in a
   way that prevents tempering with or replaying the RA messages.

Internet-Draft  Requirements for an update to 6LoWPAN ND       June 2014


   The use of EUI-64 for forming the Interface ID in the link local
   address prevents the usage of Secure ND ([RFC3971] and [RFC3972]) and
   address privacy techniques.  Considering the envisioned deployments
   and the MAC layer security applied, this is not considered an issue
   at this time.  It is envisioned that the device could form a single
   CGA-based Unique Interface ID (CUID) to securely bind all of its
   addresses.  The CUID would be used as Unique Interface Identifier in
   the ARO option and the Secure ND procedures would be changed to use
   it as opposed to the source IPv6 address.

6.  IANA Considerations

   A new type is requested for an ND option.
