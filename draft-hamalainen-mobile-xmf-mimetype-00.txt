Abstract 
    
   MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and Association of Music 
   Electronics industry (AMEI) have recently produced the Mobile XMF 
   standard [1]. The Mobile XMF standard has been developed in 
   particularly for mobile MIDI [6] applications. Mobile XMF 
   information is a very compact media type providing high quality 
   synthetic audio content for music downloading and messaging 
   applications that require MIME registration.

                           Mobile XMF MIME                 July, 2004 
                                    
    
1 Introduction 
    
   MIDI content is commonly used in the Internet. Commonly MIDI 
   information is stored in the Standard MIDI File (SMF) format [7]. 
   The present MIME type registration uses the Mobile XMF file format 
   for the encapsulation of SP-MIDI [3,4] and Mobile DLS [2] data.  
 
2 Registration of audio/mobile-xmf 
 
   MIME media type name: audio 
    
   MIME subtype name: mobile-xmf 
    
   Required parameters: none 
    
   Optional parameters: 
    
        prl 
         
        prl is a string (inside double quotation marks ææ
                                                        ÆÆ) containing 
        the playback resources included in all Content Description 
        MetaDataItems of the Mobile XMF file. The string contains two 
        digit hexadecimal numbers representing data bytes from the 
        Content Description Meta Data. The same resource is listed only 
        once. A playback resource contains two parts: a prefix and 
        data. If the file includes Playback Resource Lists such as [00h 
        01h 00h 02h] and [00h 01h 00h 03h], the corresponding prl is 
        ææ000100020003ÆÆ containing playback resources 01, 02, and 03 
        with the prefix 00.  
         
        minimum-pr 
         
        minimum-pr is a string containing the Maximum Instantaneous 
        Resource (MIR) values from the first row of all MIR Count 
        Tables corresponding to the playback resources listed in prl. 
        Only the largest value from the values of the same resource is 
        chosen. If the file includes first rows of MIR Count Tables 
        such as [02h 00h] and [01h 01h] corresponding to the above 
        Playback Resource Lists, the corresponding minimum-pr is 
        ææ020001ÆÆ. (02 is the largest of 2 and 1, 00 is the largest of 
        0, and 01 is the largest of 1.) minimum-pr requires the use of 
        prl and the values in minimum-pr must be in the same order as 
        the resources in prl. minimum-pr is the most important of 
        minimum-pr and total-pr, because it defines the minimum 
        playback requirements. 
         
        total-pr 
         
        total-pr is a string containing the MIR values from the last 
        row of all MIR Count Tables corresponding to the playback 
        resources listed in prl. Only the largest value from the values 
        of the same resource is chosen. If the file includes last rows

                           Mobile XMF MIME                 July, 2004 
                                    
        of MIR Count Tables such as [05h 02h] and [06h 01h] 
        corresponding to the above Playback Resource Lists, the 
        corresponding total-pr is ææ060201ÆÆ. (06 is the largest of 5 and 
        6, 02 is the largest of 2, and 01 is the largest of 1.) total-
        pr requires the use of prl and the values in total-pr must be 
        in the same order as the resources in prl. 
         
   Encoding considerations:  
         
        mobile-xmf data is binary data and must be encoded for non-
        binary transport; Base64 is suitable for Email 
    
   Security considerations: 
         
        Many synthetic audio compositions have associated intellectual 
        property rights. It is conceivable that rights owners of 
        mobile-xmf content will want to protect their rights by 
        applying security mechanisms that prohibit the rendering of the 
        content without a legally acquired license to do so. These 
        mechanisms would be applied externally to the Content-Type 
        defined here; mobile-xmf content itself is not encrypted 
        internally. mobile-xmf streams do not contain executable 
        content. 
    
   Interoperability considerations: 
         
        Mobile XMF is a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) 
        specification developed by MMA and AMEI. mobile-xmf is based on 
        the XMF 1.0 specification [5] which standardizes a meta file 
        format for the electronic distribution of music. mobile-xmf 
        data is stored in XMF file format [5]. 
         
    
   Published specification: 
    
        There are no previous RFC documents on audio/mobile-xmf.
