Abstract

   This document forms a certificate profile, based on RFC 3280, for
   identity certificates issued to physical persons.

   The goal of this document is to define a general syntax independent
   of local legal requirements.  The profile is however designed to
   allow further profiling in order to meet specific local needs.

   The profile defines specific conventions for certificates that are
   qualified within a defined legal framework, named Qualified
   Certificates. The profile does however not define any legal
   requirements for such Qualified Certificates.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2003


1 Introduction

   This specification is one part of a family of standards for the X.509
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for the Internet.  It is based on RFC
   3280, which defines underlying certificate formats and semantics
   needed for a full implementation of this standard.

   This profile includes specific mechanisms intended for use with
   Qualified Certificates.  The term Qualified Certificates and the
   assumptions that affects the scope of this document are discussed in
   Section 2.

   Section 3 defines requirements on certificate information content.
   This profile addresses two fields in the basic certificate as well as
   five certificate extensions.  The certificate fields are the subject
   and issuer fields.  The certificate extensions are subject directory
   attributes, certificate policies, key usage, a private extension for
   storage of biometric data and a private extension for storage of
   statements related to Qualified Certificates.  The private extensions
   are presented in the 1993 Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), but
   in conformance with RFC 3280 the 1988 ASN.1 module in Appendix A
   contains all normative definitions (the 1993 module in Appendix A is
   informative).

   In Section 4, some security considerations are discussed in order to
   clarify the security context in which the standard may be utilized.
   Section 5 contains the references.

   Appendix A contains all relevant ASN.1 [X.680] structures that are
   not already defined in RFC 3280.  Appendix B contains a note on
   attributes.  Appendix C contains an example certificate.  Appendix D
   contains authors' addresses and Appendix E contains the IETF
   Copyright Statement.

   It should be noted that this specification does not define the
   specific semantics of Qualified Certificates, and does not define the
   policies that should be used with them.  That is, this document
   defines what information should go into Qualified Certificates, but
   not what that information means.  A system that uses Qualified
   Certificates must define its own semantics for the information in
   Qualified Certificates.  It is expected that laws and corporate
   policies will make these definitions.

2  Requirements and Assumptions

   The term "Qualified Certificate" has been used by the European
   Commission to describe a certain type of certificates with specific
   relevance for European legislation.  This specification is intended



Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                      [Page 3]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2003


   to support this class of certificates, but its scope is not limited
   to this application.

   Within this standard the term "Qualified Certificate" is used
   generally, describing a certificate whose primary purpose is to
   identify a person with high level of assurance, where the certificate
   meet some qualification requirements defined by an applicable legal
   framework. The actual mechanisms that decide whether a certificate
   should or should not be considered to be a "Qualified Certificate" in
   regard to any legislation are outside the scope of this standard.

   Harmonization in the field of identity certificates issued to
   physical persons, in particular Qualified Certificates, is essential
   within several aspects that fall outside the scope of RFC 3280.  The
   most important aspects that affect the scope of this specification
   are:


   -  Definition of names and identity information in order to identify
      the associated subject in a uniform way.

   -  Definition of information which identifies the CA and the
      jurisdiction under which the CA operates when issuing a particular
      certificate.

   -  Definition of key usage extension usage for Qualified
      Certificates.

   -  Definition of information structure for storage of biometric
      information.

   -  Definition of a standardized way to store predefined statements
      with relevance for Qualified Certificates.

   -  Requirements for critical extensions.



2.1  Properties

   This profile accommodates profiling needs for Qualified Certificates
   based on the assumptions that:


   -  Qualified Certificates are issued by a CA that makes a public
      statement that the certificate serves the purpose of a Qualified
      Certificate, as discussed in Section 2.2




Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                      [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2003


   -  The Qualified Certificate indicates a certificate policy
      consistent with liabilities, practices and procedures undertaken
      by the CA, as discussed in 2.3

   -  The Qualified Certificate is issued to a natural person (living
      human being).

   -  The Qualified Certificate contains an identity based on a
      pseudonym or a real name of the subject.


2.2  Statement of Purpose

   This profile defines conventions to declare within a certificate that
   it serves the purpose of being a Qualified Certificate. This enables
   the CA to explicitly define this intent.

   The function of this declaration is thus to assist any concerned
   entity in evaluating the risk associated with creating or accepting
   signatures that are based on a Qualified Certificate.

   This profile defines two complementary ways to include this
   information:


   -  As information defined by a certificate policy included in the
      certificate policies extension, and

   -  As a statement included in the Qualified Certificates Statements
      extension.


2.3  Policy Issues

   Certain policy aspects define the context in which this profile is to
   be understood and used.  It is however outside the scope of this
   profile to specify any policies or legal aspects that will govern
   services that issue or utilize certificates according to this
   profile.

   It is however an underlying assumption in this profile that a
   responsible issuing CA will undertake to follow a publicly available
   certificate policy that is consistent with its liabilities, practices
   and procedures.

2.4  Uniqueness of names

   Distinguished name is originally defined in X.501 [X.501] as a



Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                      [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2003


   representation of a directory name, defined as a construct that
   identifies a particular object from among the set of all objects.  An
   object can be assigned a distinguished name without being represented
   by an entry in the Directory, but this name is then the name its
   object entry could have had if it were represented in the Directory.
   In the context of qualified certificates, a distinguished name
   denotes a set of attribute values [X.501] which forms a name that is
   unambiguous within a certain domain that forms either a real or a
   virtual DIT (Directory Information Tree)[X.501].  In the case of
   subject names the domain is assumed to be at least the issuing domain
   of the CA.  The distinguished name MUST be unique for each subject
   entity certified by the one CA as defined by the issuer name field,
   during the whole life time of the CA.

3  Certificate and Certificate Extensions Profile

   This section defines certificate profiling conventions.  The profile
   is based on the Internet certificate profile RFC 3280 which in turn
   is based on the X.509 version 3 format.  For full implementation of
   this section implementers are REQUIRED to consult the underlying
   formats and semantics defined in RFC 3280.

   ASN.1 definitions relevant for this section that are not supplied by
   RFC 3280 are supplied in Appendix A.


3.1  Basic Certificate Fields

   This specification provides additional details regarding the contents
   of two fields in the basic certificate.  These fields are the issuer
   and subject fields.

3.1.1  Issuer

   The issuer field SHALL identify the organization responsible for
   issuing the certificate.  The name SHOULD be an officially registered
   name of the organization.

   The identity of the issuer SHALL be specified using an appropriate
   subset of the following attributes:


         domainComponent;
         countryName;
         stateOrProvinceName;
         organizationName;
         localityName; and
         serialNumber.



Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                      [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2003


   Additional attributes MAY be present but they SHOULD NOT be necessary
   to identify the issuing organization.  Attributes present in the
   issuer field SHOULD be consistent with the laws under which the
   issuer operates.

   A relying party MAY have to consult associated certificate policies
   and/or the issuer's CPS, in order to determine the semantics of name
   fields and the laws under which the issuer operates.

3.1.2  Subject

   The subject field of a certificate compliant with this profile SHALL
   contain a distinguished name of the subject (see 2.4 for definition
   of distinguished name).

   The subject field SHALL contain an appropriate subset of the
   following attributes:


      countryName;
      commonName;
      surname;
      givenName;
      pseudonym;
      serialNumber;
      title;
      organizationName;
      organizationalUnitName;
      stateOrProvinceName; and
      localityName.


   Other attributes may be present but MUST NOT be necessary to
   distinguish the subject name from other subject names within the
   issuer domain.

   Of these attributes, the subject field SHALL include at least one of
   the following:


      Choice   I:  commonName
      Choice  II:  givenName
      Choice III:  pseudonym


      The countryName attribute value specifies a general context in
      which other attributes are to be understood.  The country
      attribute does not necessarily indicate the subject's country of



Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                      [Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2003


      citizenship or country of residence, nor does it have to indicate
      the country of issuance.

   Note: Many X.500 implementations require the presence of countryName
   in the DIT.  In cases where the subject name, as specified in the
   subject field, specifies a public X.500 directory entry, the
   countryName attribute SHOULD always be present.

      The commonName attribute value SHALL, when present, contain a name
      of the subject.  This MAY be in the subject's preferred
      presentation format, or a format preferred by the CA, or some
      other format. Pseudonyms, nicknames and names with spelling other
      than defined by the registered name MAY be used.  To understand
      the nature of the name presented in commonName, complying
      applications MAY have to examine present values of the givenName
      and surname attributes, or the pseudonym attribute.

      Note: Many client implementations presuppose the presence of the
      commonName attribute value in the subject field and use this value
      to display the subject's name regardless of present givenName,
      surname or pseudonym attribute values.

      The surname and givenName attribute types SHALL, if present,
      contain the registered name of the subject, in accordance with the
      laws under which the CA prepares the certificate.  These
      attributes SHALL be used in the subject field if the commonName
      attribute is not present. In cases where the subject only has a
      single name registered, the givenName attribute SHALL be used and
      the surname attribute SHALL be omitted.

      The pseudonym attribute type SHALL, if present, contain a
      pseudonym of the subject.  Use of the pseudonym attribute MUST NOT
      be combined with use of any of the attributes surname and/or
      givenName.

      The serialNumber attribute type SHALL, when present, be used to
      differentiate between names where the subject field would
      otherwise be identical.  This attribute has no defined semantics
      beyond ensuring uniqueness of subject names.  It MAY contain a
      number or code assigned by the CA or an identifier assigned by a
      government or civil authority.  It is the CA's responsibility to
      ensure that the serialNumber is sufficient to resolve any subject
      name collisions.

      The title attribute type SHALL, when present, be used to store a
      designated position or function of the subject within the
      organization specified by present organizational attributes in the
      subject field.  The association between the title, the subject and



Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                      [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2003


      the organization is beyond the scope of this document.

      The organizationName and the organizationalUnitName attribute
      types SHALL, when present, be used to store the name and relevant
      information of an organization with which the subject is
      associated. The type of association between the organization and
      the subject is beyond the scope of this document.

      The stateOrProvinceName and the localityName attribute types
      SHALL, when present, be used to store geographical information
      with which the subject is associated.  If an organizationName
      value also is present then the stateOrProvinceName and
      localityName attribute values SHALL be associated with the
      specified organization.  The type of association between the
      stateOrProvinceName and the localityName and either the subject or
      the organizationName is beyond the scope of this document.


   Compliant implementations SHALL be able to interpret the attributes
   named in this section.

3.2  Certificate Extensions

   This specification provides additional details regarding the contents
   of five certificate extensions.  These extensions are the subject
   directory attributes, certificate policies, key usage, private
   extension for biometric information and private extension for
   Qualified Certificate statements.

3.2.1  Subject Directory Attributes

   The subjectDirectoryAttributes extension MAY contain additional
   attributes, associated with the subject, as complement to present
   information in the subject field and the subject alternative name
   extension.

   Attributes suitable for storage in this extension are attributes,
   which are not part of the subject's distinguished name, but which MAY
   still be useful for other purposes (e.g., authorization).

   This extension MUST NOT be marked critical.

   Compliant implementations SHALL be able to interpret the following
   attributes:


      dateOfBirth;
      placeOfBirth;



Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                      [Page 9]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2003


      gender;
      countryOfCitizenship; and
      countryOfResidence.


   Other attributes MAY be included according to local definitions.

   The dateOfBirth attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value of
   the date of birth of the subject.  The manner in which the date of
   birth is associated with the subject is outside the scope of this
   document.

   The placeOfBirth attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value of
   the place of birth of the subject.  The manner in which the place of
   birth is associated with the subject is outside the scope of this
   document.

   The gender attribute SHALL, when present, contain the value of the
   gender of the subject.  For females the value "F" (or "f") and for
   males the value "M" (or "m") have to be used.  The manner in which
   the gender is associated with the subject is outside the scope of
   this document.

   The countryOfCitizenship attribute SHALL, when present, contain the
   identifier of at least one of the subject's claimed countries of
   citizenship at the time that the certificate was issued.  If the
   subject is a citizen of more than one country, more than one country
   MAY be present.  Determination of citizenship is a matter of law and
   is outside the scope of this document.

   The countryOfResidence attribute SHALL, when present, contain the
   value of at least one country in which the subject is resident.  If
   the subject is a resident of more than one country, more than one
   country MAY be present.  Determination of residence is a matter of
   law and is outside the scope of this document.

3.2.2 Certificate Policies

   The certificate policies extension SHALL contain the identifier of at
   least one certificate policy which reflects the practices and
   procedures undertaken by the CA.  The certificate policy extension
   MAY be marked critical.

   Information provided by the issuer stating the purpose of the
   certificate as discussed in Section 2.2 SHOULD be evident through
   indicated policies.

   The certificate policies extension SHOULD include all policy



Santesson, Nystrom, & Polk                                     [Page 10]

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2003


   information needed for validation of the certificate.  If policy
   information is included in the QCStatements extension (see 3.2.5),
   then this information SHOULD also be defined by indicated policies.

   Certificate policies MAY be combined with any qualifier defined in
   RFC 3280.

3.2.3  Key Usage

   The key usage extension SHALL be present. Key usage settings SHALL be
   set in accordance with RFC 3280 definitions. Further requirements on
   key usage settings MAY be defined by local policy and/or local legal
   requirements.

   The key usage extension MAY be marked critical.

3.2.4  Biometric Information

   This section defines an extension for storage of biometric
   information.  Biometric information is stored in the form of a hash
   of a biometric template.

   The purpose of this extension is to provide means for authentication
   of biometric information.  The biometric information that corresponds
   to the stored hash is not stored in this extension, but the extension
   MAY include an URI pointing to a location where this information can
   be obtained.  If included, this URI does not imply that this is the
   only way to access this information.

   It is RECOMMENDED that biometric information in this extension is
   limited to information types suitable for human verification, i.e.,
   where the decision of whether the information is an accurate
   representation of the subject is naturally performed by a person.
   This implies a usage where the biometric information is represented
   by, for example, a graphical image displayed to the relying party,
   which MAY be used by the relying party to enhance identification of
   the subject.

   This extension MUST NOT be marked critical.

      biometricInfo  EXTENSION ::= {
          SYNTAX             BiometricSyntax
          IDENTIFIED BY      id-pe-biometricInfo }

          biometricDataID            OBJECT IDENTIFIER }

      PredefinedBiometricType ::= INTEGER { picture(0),
          handwritten-signature(1)} (picture|handwritten-signature,...)

   The predefined biometric type picture, when present, SHALL identify
   that the source picture is in the form of a displayable graphical
   image of the subject.  The hash of the graphical image SHALL only be
   calculated over the image data excluding any labels defining the
   image type.

   The predefined biometric type handwritten-signature, when present,
   SHALL identify that the source data is in the form of a displayable
   graphical image of the subject's handwritten signature.  The hash of
   the graphical image SHALL only be calculated over the image data
   excluding any labels defining the image type.

3.2.5  Qualified Certificate Statements

   This section defines an extension for inclusion of statements
   defining explicit properties of the certificate.

   A statement suitable for inclusion in this extension MAY be a
   statement by the issuer that the certificate is issued as a Qualified
   Certificate in accordance with a particular legal system (as
   discussed in Section 2.2).

   Other statements suitable for inclusion in this extension MAY be
   statements related to the applicable legal jurisdiction within which
   the certificate is issued.  As an example this MAY include a maximum
   reliance limit for the certificate indicating restrictions on CA's
   liability.

   Each statement SHALL include an object identifier for the statement
   and MAY also include optional qualifying data contained in the
   statementInfo parameter.

   If the statementInfo parameter is included then the object identifier
   of the statement SHALL define the syntax and SHOULD define the
   semantics of this parameter.  If the object identifier does not

INTERNET DRAFT       Qualified Certificates Profile            July 2003


   define the semantics, a relying party may have to consult a relevant
   certificate policy or CPS to determine the exact semantics.

   This extension may be critical or non-critical.  If the extension is
   critical, this means that all statements included in the extension
   are regarded as critical.

      qcStatements  EXTENSION ::= {
          SYNTAX             QCStatements
          IDENTIFIED BY      id-pe-qcStatements }

      id-pe-qcStatements     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe 3 }

      QCStatements ::= SEQUENCE OF QCStatement

      QCStatement ::= SEQUENCE {
          statementId   QC-STATEMENT.&Id({SupportedStatements}),
          statementInfo QC-STATEMENT.&Type
          ({SupportedStatements}{@statementId}) OPTIONAL }

      SupportedStatements QC-STATEMENT ::= { qcStatement-1,...}

3.2.5.1 Predefined Statements

   This profile includes one predefined object identifier (id-qcs-
   pkixQCSyntax-v1), identifying conformance with syntax and semantics

   one or more name registration authorities.

   The semanticsIdentifier component, if present, SHALL contain an OID,
   defining semantics for attributes and names in basic certificate
   fields and certificate extensions.  The OID may define semantics for
   all, or for a subgroup of all present attributes and/or names.

   The NameRegistrationAuthorities component, if present, SHALL contain
   a name of one or more name registration authorities, responsible for
   registration of attributes or names associated with the subject.  The
   association between an identified name registration authority and
   present attributes MAY be defined by a semantics identifier OID, by a
   certificate policy (or CPS) or some other implicit factors.

   If a value of type SemanticsInformation is present in a QCStatement
   then at least one of the fields semanticsIdentifier and
   nameRegistrationAuthorities must be present, as indicated.

4  Security Considerations

   The legal value of a digital signature that is validated with a
   Qualified Certificate will be highly dependent upon the policy
   governing the use of the associated private key.  Both the private
   key holder as well as the relying party should make sure that the
   private key is used only with the consent of the legitimate key
   holder.

   Since the public keys are for public use with legal implications for
   involved parties, certain conditions should exist before CAs issue
   certificates as Qualified Certificates.  The associated private keys
   must be unique for the subject, and must be maintained under the
   subject's sole control.  That is, a CA should not issue a qualified
   certificate if the means to use the private key is not protected
   against unintended usage.  This implies that the CA have some
   knowledge about the subject's cryptographic module.

   The CA must further verify that the public key contained in the
   certificate is legitimately representing the subject.

   CAs should not issue CA certificates with policy mapping extensions
   indicating acceptance of another CA's policy unless these conditions
   are met.

   Combining the nonRepudiation bit in the keyUsage certificate
   extension with other keyUsage bits may have security implications and
   this specification therefore recommends against such practices.

   The ability to compare two qualified certificates to determine if

   they represent the same physical entity is dependent on the semantics
   of the subjects' names.  The semantics of a particular attribute may
   be different for different issuers.  Comparing names without
   knowledge of the semantics of names in these particular certificates
   may provide misleading results.

   This specification is a profile of RFC 3280.  The security
   considerations section of that document applies to this specification
   as well.

A. ASN.1 definitions

   As in RFC 3280, ASN.1 modules are supplied in two different variants
   of the ASN.1 syntax.

   Appendix A.1 is in the 1988 syntax, and does not use macros. However,
   since the module imports type definitions from modules in RFC 3280
   which are not completely in the 1988 syntax, the same comments as in
   RFC 3280 regarding its use applies here as well; i.e., Appendix A.1
   may be parsed by an 1988 ASN.1-parser by removing the definitions for
   the UNIVERSAL types and all references to them in RFC 3280's 1988
   modules.

   Appendix A.2 is in the 1993 syntax.  However, since the module
   imports type definitions from modules in RFC 3280 which are not
   completely in the 1993 syntax, the same comments as in RFC 3280
   regarding its use applies here as well; i.e., Appendix A.2 may be
   parsed by an 1993 ASN.1-parser by removing the UTF8String choice from
   the definition of DirectoryString in the module PKIX1Explicit93 in
   RFC 3280.  Appendix A.2 may be parsed "as is" by an 1997 ASN.1
   parser, however.

   In case of discrepancies between these modules, the 1988 module is
   the normative one.

B. A Note on Attributes

   This document defines several new attributes, both for use in the
   subject field of issued certificates and in the
   subjectDirectoryAttributes extension.  In the interest of conformity,
   they have been defined here using the ASN.1 ATTRIBUTE definition from
   RFC 3280, which is sufficient for the purposes of this document, but
   greatly simplified in comparison with ISO/ITU's definition.  A
   complete definition of these new attributes (including matching
   rules), along with object classes to support them in LDAP-accessible

C. Example Certificate

   This section contains the ASN.1 structure, an ASN.1 dump, and the
   DER-encoding of a certificate issued in conformance with this
   profile.  The example has been developed with the help of the OSS
   ASN.1 compiler.  The certificate has the following characteristics:

      1.  The certificate is signed with RSA and the SHA-1 hash
          algorithm
      2.  The issuer's distinguished name is O=GMD - Forschungszentrum
          Informationstechnik GmbH; C=DE
      3.  The subject's distinguished name is CN=Petra M.  Barzin, O=GMD
          - Forschungszentrum Informationstechnik GmbH, C=DE
      4.  The certificate was issued on May 1, 2000 and will expire on
          November 1, 2000
      5.  The certificate contains a 1024 bit RSA key
      6.  The certificate includes a critical key usage extension
          exclusively indicating non-repudiation
      7.  The certificate includes a certificate policy identifier
          extension indicating the practices and procedures undertaken
          by the issuing CA (object identifier 1.3.36.8.1.1).  The
          certificate policy object identifier is defined by TeleTrust,
          Germany.  It is required to be set in a certificate conformant
          to the German digital signature law.
      8.  The certificate includes a subject directory attributes
          extension containing the following attributes:
          surname:               Barzin
          given name:            Petra
          date of birth:         October, 14th 1971
          place of birth:        Darmstadt
          country of citizenship:Germany
          gender:                Female
      9.  The certificate includes a qualified statement private
          extension indicating that the naming registration authority's
          name as "municipality@darmstadt.de".
      10. The certificate includes, in conformance with RFC 3280, an
          authority key identifier extension.

C.1 ASN.1 Structure

C.1.1 Extensions

   Since extensions are DER-encoded already when placed in the structure
   to be signed, they are for clarity shown here in the value notation
   defined in [X.680].

C.1.1.1 The subjectDirectoryAttributes extension
