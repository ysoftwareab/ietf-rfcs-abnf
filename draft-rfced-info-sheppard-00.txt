Internet-Draft             EPC to DBS Interface             January 1997

1    Introduction

     An EPC is used to electronically retrieve the information contained
     within the printed parts books.  This is usually accomplished
     with a highly graphical interface.  In addition, most EPCs run
     on Windows-based PC's.  The EPC is only a lookup/ reference
     tool, but it does allow for the creation of "pick lists".  A pick 
     list places a number of part numbers along with the corresponding 
     quantities requested into a list.

     A DBS is used to catalog the Part Numbers available at an Equipment
     Dealer/ Distributor's location. Typical systems allow for the entry
     of Part Numbers, Quantity on Hand, Quantity on Order, Bin Location,
     Retail Price, Customer Price, Suggested Retail Price, etc...  These
     systems typically run on Unix based mainframes.

     With the rising use of EPCs in the outdoor power, agricultural, 
     and construction equipment industries the need to share data in 
     real-time with the legacy DBSs has become a key issue 
     to successfully installing these systems.  A number of 
     proprietary, operating system specific, and inflexible 
     protocols have been proposed to handle these interactions.  
     It is the intent of this Internet-Draft to describe an interface 
     which has been successfully implemented that overcomes the 
     limitations of previous interfaces.


2    Key Features

     The key features of this interface are as follows:

     - expand-ability  The framework is expansion-friendly

     - network independent  Although tcp/ip is the only 
       protocol currently used to implement this interface 
       there other protocols that share TCP's key features 
       such as ISO 8072 could be used instead.

     - client-server 

     - decoupling  The DBS and the EPC can each be upgraded 
       without requiring a simultaneous upgrade in the other.  This 
       is particularly important in environments with EPC's from 
       several vendors being used simultaneously.

     - operating system independent 

     - real-time  The user always sees the most current 
       information.

3    Protocol 

     The protocol is very simple.  Data is transferred in both 
     directions using the same format.  Each line in the transfer 
     is split up into four pieces.
     
     The first character is the `table'.  Some might feel more 
     comfortable referring to this as the `file' or `database', 
     but since table is a less ambiguous term that is what this 
     I-D will use.  Examples of tables would be the part, stock 
     part, pick list header, and pick list detail.  Each of these 
     has a unique character.  The capitalization of this character 
     is also significant.  It is used to indicate the beginning of 
     records.  If the table character is a capital, that indicates 
     the beginning of a record.  If it is lower case, then it is a 
     continuation of the current record.  If the table is `#' then 
     the rest of the line is ignored and is a comment.  These 
     comments are not intended to be displayed to the user.  They 
     are there merely to facilitate the debugging process.
     
     The second character is the `field'.  Within each table 
     characters are defined for individual fields such as 
     `manufacturer', `part number', and `description'.  Again, the 
     capitalization of the characters is relevant.  If a field is 
     a capital letter it indicates information that is known.  If 
     it is lower case it indicates information that is being 
     requested.  The `*' character can be used to request all 
     available information.  Although no one has currently 
     implemented it, it is possible for this character to be used 
     to delete or count matching records.
     
     The third piece is simply a space (ASCII 32).
     
     The fourth piece consumes the rest of the line.  It is the 
     `value'.  Monetary values are expressed in pennies. $123.45 
     would be passed as `12345'.  The line should be terminated 
     with a UNIX (LF) or DOS (CR/LF) line terminator.  There 
     should be no white space between the end of the value and the 
     line terminator.  If there is, it should be ignored.  White 
     space includes space, tab and other control characters.  For 
     purposes of this I-D ASCII 1-32 except LF should be 
     considered white space.
     
     One particularly important point of this interface is the 
     decoupling of the EPC and DBS.  To achieve this version 
     numbers are used.  As long as the major number hasn't 
     changed, both ends should cope gracefully with new tables and 
     fields.  The EPC or the DBS may have fields which the other 
     does not.  That these fields might be sent should not crash 
     the interface, or cause the user to see an error message.  
     The current version number is 2.1.


Sheppard                                                        [Page 3]


Internet-Draft             EPC to DBS Interface             January 1997

     In the tcp/ip realm it has become common practice for the DBS 
     to accept connections on port 2345. Many clients also rely on 
     resolving `bsihost' to the IP address of the server.
     
     Also the system information passed in the `$' table should be 
     the first thing sent.  The client should send in the order 
     `H' then `V' then the other optional `$' fields.  The server 
     should start with a `V' that is the same major number as the 
     client.  The other `$' fields should not be passed since they 
     would be superfluous.

     The client and server should both finish by sending a final 
     line of `QUIT' or `DONE'.  While `DONE' may still be in use, 
     `QUIT' is preferred since it is more consistent with other 
     tcp/ip protocols.  Version 2 clients and servers should 
     support both, but Version 3 and greater clients and servers 
     should support and send only `QUIT'.
     
     Appendix A lists the currently defined tables and fields.

4    Examples 

     These examples are provided to help make the protocol easier 
     to understand.

4.1  Part Queries 

     The EPC might send the following to the DBS:

          $H N-Compass 
          $V 2.1 
          $U tom
          SE XYZ 
          sI 12345 
          s* 
          QUIT
     
     In this case 'tom' is on 'N-Compass' running a version 2.1 EPC 
     and is requesting information on part
     12345 from manufacturer XYZ.  
     
     The DBS might respond with
     
          $V 2.1 
          QUIT
     
     This would indicate that no information is available.  Its 
     likely that the DBS does not have that part on file.  
     The DBS could have responded with:

Internet-Draft              EPC to DBS Interface             January 1997

          $V 2.1 
          SE XYZ 
          sI 12345 
          sB top shelf 
          sC 123 
          sO 2 
          sQ 550 
          sD what-cha-ma-jig 
          QUIT
     
     This indicates that the EPC should display the information to 
     the user.  The DBS also might have responded with
     
          $V 2.1 
          SE XYZ 
          sI 12345 
          sB top shelf 
          sC 123 
          sO 2 
          sQ 550 
          sD what-cha-ma-jig 
          sA don't sell this without grease and instructions 
          sA Bob knows how to install this 
          QUIT
     
     In this case, the dealer or the manufacturer have added 
     comments for this part.  If possible this information should 
     be displayed to the user in the EPC.
     
     Another example of a query from the EPC is 
     
          $H N-Compass 
          $V 2.1 
          $U tom 
          TE XYZ 
          tI 12345 
          tD What-Cha-Ma-Jiggy 
          tZ US
          tC 123 
          tS 456 
          t* 
          SE XYZ 
          sI 12345 
          s* 
          QUIT
     
     In this case the EPC knows information about the part that is 
     relevant in the US.  The DBS should store this information 
     and use it to compute markups (actual customer prices are 
     calculated).

4.2  Pick Lists 

     An example of a simple pick list sent from the EPC would be:

          $H N-Compass 
          $V 2.1 
          $U tom 
          HI 1 
          hN sale for maury 
          hS S 
          DH 1 
          dI 1 
          dQ 2 
          dM XYZ 
          dP 12345 
          DH 1 
          dI 2 
          dQ 4 
          dM XYZ 
          dP 67890 
          QUIT
     
     In this case two parts are to be invoiced.  The first part is 
     quantity 2 of manufacturer `XYZ' part `12345'.  The second 
     part is quantity 4 of manufacturer `XYZ' part `67890'.

5    Mass Updates 

     Support for this feature is not necessarily available on all 
     current implementations.  If the user would like to have the 
     DBS updated with information from the EPC, they should be 
     able to start a mass update.  The mass update would include 
     the normal $H and $V information.  Then T records would be 
     passed.

6    Security Considerations of this Memo 

     Most vendors involved have not been concerned about security 
     and all current implementations make few if any security 
     checks.  The host and user information included in the 
     information from the client is assumed by most servers to be 
     correct.  While on a small private network this may or may 
     not be acceptable, something such as SSL or PGP should be 
     used in Internet environments.

                           the first line the EPC sends to the DBS. 
                           The hostname need not be sent by the DBS 
                           to the EPC.

                           second record sent by the EPC and the 
                           first record sent by the DBS.
