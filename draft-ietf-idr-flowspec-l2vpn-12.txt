INTERNET-DRAFT                                           L2VPN Flow Spec


1. Introduction

   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Flow-spec [RFC5575bis] is an extension
   to BGP that supports the dissemination of traffic flow specification
   rules and actions to be taken on packets in a specified flow.  It
   leverages the BGP Control Plane to simplify the distribution of ACLs
   (Access Control Lists).  Using the Flow-spec extension new filter
   rules can be injected to all BGP peers simultaneously without
   changing router configuration.  The typical application is to
   automate the distribution of traffic filter lists to routers for DDOS
   (Distributed Denial of Service) mitigation, access control, etc.

   BGP Flow-spec [RFC5575bis] defines a BGP Network Layer Reachability
   Information (NLRI) format used to distribute traffic flow
   specification rules.  NLRI (AFI=1, SAFI=133) is for IPv4 unicast
   filtering.  NLRI (AFI=1, SAFI=134) is for IPv4 BGP/MPLS VPN
   filtering.  The Flow specification match part defined in [RFC5575bis]
   only includes L3/L4 information like IPv4 source/destination prefix,
   protocol, ports, and the like, so traffic flows can only be filtered
   based on L3/L4 information. This has been extended by [FlowSpecV6] to
   cover IPv6.

   Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPNs) have been deployed in an
   increasing number of networks.  Such networks also have requirements
   to deploy BGP Flow-spec to mitigate DDoS attack traffic.  Within an
   L2VPN network, both IP and non-IP Ethernet traffic maybe exist.  For
   IP traffic filtering, the Flow specification rules defined in
   [RFC5575bis] and/or [FlowSpecV6], which include match criteria and
   actions, can still be used. Flow specification rules received via the
   new NLRI format apply only to traffic that belongs to the VPN
   instance(s) in which it is imported.  For non-IP Ethernet traffic
   filtering, Layer 2 related information like source/destination MAC
   and VLAN need to be considered.

   There are different kinds of L2VPN networks like EVPN [RFC7432], BGP
   VPLS [RFC4761], LDP VPLS [RFC4762] and border gateway protocol (BGP)
   auto discovery [RFC6074].  Because the Flow-spec feature relies on
   the BGP protocol to distribute traffic filtering rules, it can only
   be incrementally deployed in those L2VPN networks where BGP has
   already been used for auto discovery and/or signaling purposes such
   as BGP- based VPLS [RFC4761], EVPN and LDP-based VPLS [RFC4762] with
   BGP auto-discovery [RFC6074].

   This draft defines new Flow-spec component types and two new extended
   communities to support L2VPN Flow-spec application.  The Flow-spec
   rules can be enforced on all border routers or on some interface sets
   of the border routers.  SAFI=134 in [RFC5575bis] and [FlowSpecV6] is
   extended for AFI=25 as specified in Section 2 to cover traffic
   filtering information in an L2VPN environment.

1.1 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following acronyms are used in this document:

      ACL - Access Control List

      DDOS - Distributed Denial of Service

      EVPN - Ethernet VPN [RFC7432]

      L2VPN - Layer 2 VPN

      L3VPN - Layer 3 VPN

      PCP - Priority Code Point [802.1Q]

      TPID - Tag Protocol ID, typically a VLAN ID

      VLAN = Virtual Local Area Network

      VPLS - Virtual Private Line Service [RFC4762]

      VPN - Virtual Private Network

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           L2VPN Flow Spec


2. Layer 2 Flow Specification Encoding in BGP

   [RFC5575bis] defines SAFI 133 and SAFI 134, with AFI=1, for
   "dissemination of IPv4 flow specification rules" and "dissemination
   of VPNv4 flow specification rules", respectively.  [FlowSpecV6]]
   extends [RFC5575bis] to also allow AFI=2 thus making it applicable to
   both IPv4 and IPv6 applications.  This document further extends the
   SAFI=134 for AFI=25 and make it applicable to L2VPN applications.

   The following change is specified:

      "SAFI 134 for dissemination of L3VPN flow specification rules" in
      [FlowSpecV6] is defined as "SAFI 134 for dissemination of VPN flow
      specification rules"

   The address family to which SAFI 134 refers is indicate by the AFI
   value (AFI=1 for VPNv4, AFI=2 VPNv6 and AFI=25 for L2VPN).  Such
   extension is fully backwards compatible with existing implementation
   and production deployments.

3. L2VPN Flow Specification Encoding in BGP

   The NLRI format for AFI=25/SAFI=134, as with the other VPN Flow-spec
   AFI/SAFI pairs, consists of an overall length encoded as provided in
   Section 4.1 of [RFC5575bis], then a fixed-length Route Distinguisher
   field (8 octets), then a flow specification [RFC5575bis] [FlowSpecV6]
   that may include the component types defined in this document.  The
   length field includes both the 8 octets of the Route Distinguisher as
   well as the subsequent flow specification.

       +------------------------------+
       | length  (0xnn or 0xfn nn)    |
       +------------------------------+
       | Route Distinguisher (8 bytes)|
       +------------------------------+
       | NLRI value  (variable)       |
       +------------------------------+

   Flow specification rules received via this NLRI apply only to traffic
   that belongs to the VPN instance(s) into which it is imported.  Flow
   rules are accepted as specified in Section 5.

   Besides the component types defined in [RFC5575bis] and [FlowSpecV6],
   this document specifies the following additional component types for
   L2 VPN Ethernet traffic filtering:

   Type tbdA - Ethernet Type (EtherType)
   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>

      Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match two-octet
      field.  op is encoded as specified in Section 4.2.3 of
      [RFC5575bis]. Values are encoded as 2-octet quantities.  Ethernet
      II framing defines the two-octet Ethernet Type (EtherType) field
      in an Ethernet frame, preceded by destination and source MAC
      addresses, that identifies an upper layer protocol encapsulating
      the frame data.

   Type tbdB - Source MAC
   Encoding: <type (1 octet), MAC Address length (1 octet), MAC Address>

      Defines the source MAC Address to match.

   Type tbdC - Destination MAC
   Encoding: <type (1 octet), MAC Address length (1 octet), MAC Address>

      Defines the destination MAC Address to match.

   Type tbdD - DSAP (Destination Service Access Point) in LLC
   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>

      Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match the
      1-octet DSAP in the 802.2 LLC (Logical Link Control Header).
      Values are encoded as 1-octet quantities.  op is encoded as
      specified in Section 4.2.3 of [RFC5575bis].

   Type tbdE - SSAP (Source Service Access Point) in LLC
   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>

      Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match the
      1-octet SSAP in the 802.2 LLC.  Values are encoded as 1-octet
      quantities. op is encoded as specified in Section 4.2.3 of
      [RFC5575bis].

   Type tbdF - Control field in LLC
   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>

      Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match 1-octet
      control field in the 802.2 LLC.  Values are encoded as 1-octet
      quantities. op is encoded as specified in Section 4.2.3 of
      [RFC5575bis].

   Type tbdG - SNAP
   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>

      Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match 5-octet
      SNAP (Sub-Network Access Protocol) field.  Values are encoded as
      5-octet quantities. op is encoded as specified in Section 4.2.3 of
      [RFC5575bis].

   Type tbdH - VLAN ID
   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>

      Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match VLAN ID.
      Values are encoded as 2-octet quantities, where the four most
      significant bits are zero and the 12 least significant bits
      contain the VLAN value. op is encoded as specified in Section
      4.2.3 of [RFC5575bis].

      In the virtual local-area network (VLAN) stacking case, the VLAN
      ID is the outer VLAN ID.

   Type tbdI - VLAN PCP
   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>

      Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match 3-bit
      VLAN PCP fields [802.1Q].  Values are encoded using a single
      octet, where the five most significant bits are zero and the three
      least significant bits contain the VLAN PCP value. op is encoded
      as specified in Section 4.2.3 of [RFC5575bis].



W. Hao, et al                                                   [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           L2VPN Flow Spec


      In the virtual local-area network (VLAN) stacking case, the VLAN
      PCP is outer VLAN PCP.

   Type tbdJ - Inner VLAN ID
   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>

      Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match the inner
      VLAN ID using for virtual local-area network (VLAN) stacking or Q
      in Q use.  Values are encoded as 2-octet quantities, where the
      four most significant bits are zero and the 12 least significant
      bits contain the VLAN value. op is encoded as specified in Section
      4.2.3 of [RFC5575bis].

      In single VLAN case, this component type MUST NOT be used. If it
      appears the match will fail.

   Type tbdK - Inner VLAN PCP
   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>

      Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match 3-bit
      inner VLAN PCP fields [802.1Q] using for virtual local-area
      network (VLAN) stacking or Q in Q use.  Values are encoded using a
      single octet, where the five most significant bits are zero and
      the three least significant bits contain the VLAN PCP value. op is
      encoded as specified in Section 4.2.3 of [RFC5575bis].

      In single VLAN case, the component type MUST NOT be used. If it
      appears the match will fail.

   Type tbdL - VLAN DEI
   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), op (1 octet)>

      This type tests the DEI bit in the VLAN tag. If op is zero, it
      matches if and only if the DEI bit is zero. If op is non-zero, it
      matches if and only if the DEI bit is one.

   Type tbdM - Inner VLAN DEI
   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), op (1 octet)>

      This type tests the DEI bit in the inner VLAN tag. If op is zero,
      it matches if and only if the DEI bit is zero. If op is non-zero,
      it matches if and only if the DEI bit is one.



3.1 Order of Traffic Filtering Rules

   The original definition for the order of traffic filtering rules can
   be reused with new consideration for the MAC Address offset.  As long
   as the offsets are equal, the comparison is the same, retaining


W. Hao, et al                                                   [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                           L2VPN Flow Spec


   longest-prefix-match semantics.  If the offsets are not equal, the
   lowest offset has precedence, as this flow matches the most
   significant bit.

   Pseudocode:
   flow_rule_L2_cmp (a, b)
   {
       comp1 = next_component(a);
       comp2 = next_component(b);
       while (comp1 || comp2) {
           // component_type returns infinity on end-of-list
           if (component_type(comp1) < component_type(comp2)) {
               return A_HAS_PRECEDENCE;
           }
           if (component_type(comp1) > component_type(comp2)) {
               return B_HAS_PRECEDENCE;
           }

           if (component_type(comp1) == MAC_DESTINATION || MAC_SOURCE) {
               common = MIN(MAC Address length (comp1),
                        MAC Address length (comp2));
               cmp = MAC Address compare(comp1, comp2, common);
               // not equal, lowest value has precedence
               // equal, longest match has precedence
           } else {
               common =
                  MIN(component_length(comp1), component_length(comp2));

               // not equal, lowest value has precedence
               // equal, longest string has precedence
           }
       }
       return EQUAL;

4. Ethernet Flow Specification Traffic Actions

   The default action for a layer 2 traffic filtering flow specification
   is to accept traffic that matches that particular rule.  The
   following extended community values per [RFC5575bis] can be used to
   specify particular actions in an L2 VPN network:

       +--------+--------------------+----------------------------+
       |  type  | extended community |          encoding          |
       +--------+--------------------+----------------------------+
       | 0x8006 | traffic-rate       | 2-octet as#, 4-octet float |
       | 0x8007 | traffic-action     | bitmask                    |
       | 0x8008 | redirect           | 6-octet Route Target       |
       | 0x8009 | traffic-marking    | DSCP value                 |
       +--------+--------------------+----------------------------+

   Redirect: The action should be redefined to allow the traffic to be
   redirected to a MAC or IP VRF routing instance that lists the
   specified route-target in its import policy.

   Besides the above extended communities, this document also specifies
   the following BGP extended communities for Ethernet flows to extend
   [RFC5575bis]:

      +--------+------------------------+--------------------------+
      | type   | extended community     |   encoding               |
      +--------+------------------------+--------------------------+
      |  TBD1  | VLAN-action            |   bitmask                |
      |  TBD2  | TPID-action            |   bitmask                |
      +--------+------------------------+--------------------------+



4.1 VLAN-action

   The VLAN-action extended community, as shown in the diagram below,
   consists of 6 octets that include t action Flags, two VLAN IDs, and
   the associated PCP and DEI values.  The action Flags fields are
   further divided into two parts which correspond to the first action
   and the second action respectively. Bit 0 to bit 7 give the first
   action while bit 8 to bit 15 give the second action.  The bits of PO,
   PU, SW, RI and RO in each part represent the action of Pop, Push,
   Swap, Rewrite inner VLAN and Rewrite outer VLAN respectively.
   Through this method, more complicated actions also can be represented
   in a single VLAN-action extended community, such as SwapPop,
   PushSwap, etc.  For example, SwapPop action is the sequence of two
   actions, the first action is Swap and the second action is Pop.

   PO1: Pop action.  If the PO1 flag is one, it indicates the outmost
   VLAN should be removed.

   PU1: Push action.  If PU1 is one, it indicates VLAN ID1 will be
   added, the associated PCP and DEI are PCP1 and DE1.

   VLAN and inner VLAN should be swapped.

   PO2: Pop action.  If the PO2 flag is one, it indicates the outmost
   VLAN should be removed.

   PU2: Push action.  If PU2 is one, it indicates VLAN ID2 will be
   added, the associated PCP and DEI are PCP2 and DE2.

   SW2: Swap action.  If the SW2 flag is one, it indicates the outer
   VLAN and inner VLAN should be swapped.

   RI1 and RI2: Rewrite inner VLAN action.  If the RI flag is one, it
   indicates the inner VLAN should be replaced by a new VLAN where the
   new VLAN is VLAN ID1 and the associated PCP and DEO are PCP1 and DE1.
   If the VLAN ID1 is 0, the action is to only modify the PCP and DEI
   value of the inner VLAN.

   RO1 and RO2: Rewrite outer VLAN action.  If the RO flag is one, it
   indicates the outer VLAN should be replaced by a new VLAN where the
   new VLAN is VLAN ID and the associated PCP and DEI are PCP2 and DE2.
   If the VLAN ID2 is 0, the action is to only modify the PCP and DEI
   value of the outer VLAN.

   Resv, R1, and R2: Reserved for future use.  MUST be sent as zero and
   ignored on receipt.

   Giving an example below: if the action of PUSH Inner VLAN 10 with PCP
   value 5 DEI value 0 and Outer VLAN 20 with PCP value 6 DEI value 0 is
   needed, the format of the VLAN-action extended community is as
   follows:

4.2 TPID-action

   The TPID-action extended community consists of 6 octets which
   includes the fields of action Flags, TPID1 and TPID2.

      +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   TI: Mapping inner TP ID action.  If the TI flag is one, it indicates
   the inner TP ID should be replaced by a new TP ID, the new TP ID is
   TP ID1.

   TO: Mapping outer TP ID action.  If the TO flag is one, it indicates
   the outer TP ID should be replaced by a new TP ID, the new TP ID is
   TP ID2.

   Resv: Reserved for future use.  MUST be sent as zero and ignored on
   receipt.

5. Flow Spec Validation

   Flow-specs received over AFI=25/SAFI=134 are validated against
   routing reachability received over AFI=25/SAFI=128 as modified to
   conform to [FlowSpecOID].

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to change the description for SAFI 134 [RFC5575bis]
   to read as follows and to change the reference for it to [this
   document]:

      134  VPN dissemination of flow specification rules

   IANA is requested to allocate 11 new values in the Flow-Spec
   Component Type registry as follows:

     +--------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
     |  type  |        Reference         |       description        |

     |  tbdM  | [this document]          | Inner VLAN DEI           |
     +--------+--------------------------+--------------------------+

   IANA is requested to assign two values from the "BGP Extended
   Communities Type - extended, transitive" registry [suggested value
   provided in square brackets]:

       Type value      Name                      Reference
      ------------    ------------------------  ---------------
      TBD1[0x080A]    Flow spec VLAN action     [this document]
      TBD2[0x080B]    Flow spec TPID action     [this document]

7. Security Considerations

   For General BGP Flow-spec Security Considerations, see [RFC5575bis].

   VLAN tagging identifies Layer 2 communities which are commonly
   expected to be isolated except when higher layer connection is
   provided, such as Layer 3 routing. The ability of the Flow-spec VLAN
   action to change the VLAN ID in a frame thus may compromise security.
