1.  Introduction

   This document extends the use of Anycast-SID FRR to provide links and
   domain boundary nodes that use segment routing.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

3.  Motivation

   The procedures specified in this document, in combination with
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] provide the fast redundancy
   protection.

   The procedures specified in this document aims at providing
   protection of the links and domain boundary nodes for network that
   use segment routing

4.  Anycast-SID FRR Solution

4.1.  Domain boundary nodes protection

   The solution consists of three parts.

   o  Configure the same anycast prefix and associated prefix-sid for
      each domain boundary node that forms redundant protection, then
      the anycast prefix and associated prefix-sid with Anycast-Group
      flag should be advertised to the neighbor node.

   o  Create the anycast-group forwarding entry (i.e.  FRR entry) after
      the direct neighbor node of the domain boundary nodes receive the
      prefix-sid with Anycast-Group flag advertisement.  The anycast-

      group forwarding entry includes the forwarding information which
      points to each of the domain boundary node , then the forwarding
      entry pointing to the main domain boundary (one of the direct
      connected boundary nodes from the PLR) is set to the active state,
      and others are set to the backup state.  Only the direct neighbor
      of the domain boundary nodes need to set up the anycast-group
      forwarding entry.

   o  if the neighbor node detects the main domain boundary node
      failure, the neighbor node immediately activates the backup entry.
      Note that the backup entry contains the node-sid of the slave
      boundary node, and the packet will be forwarded based on the node-
      sid, not the anycast prefix-sid again.

                                 Figure 1

   The figure above describes a network example with two groups of the
   domain boundary nodes.  The GW11 and GW12 are in the same anycast
   group.  They are all configured with the same anycast prefix and the
   same prefix-sid 100, in addition, GW11 has node-sid 110 and GW12 has
   node-sid 120.  All these prefix-sid should be advertised to the
   Neighbors(e.g, node A3 and A5), and the anycast-group forwarding
   entry will be set up by the direct Neighbor node A3 and A5.  For
   example, the anycast-group forwarding entry created by A3 contains a
   master item which points to anycast-sid 100 and a slave item which
   points to node-sid 120.

   When A3 detects GW11 failure, it immediately diverting traffic from
   GW11 to A4 (e.g. the best next-hop to node-sid 120) according to the
   anycast-group forwarding entry.

   It is an implementation choice for data-plane whether the slave item
   only points to node-sid 120 for cascade table lookup, or integrates
   the forwarding information of node-sid 120 (such as a single next-
   hop, a TI-LFA FRR index for cascade table lookup, or an ECMP index
   for cascade table lookup).

   Note that the anycast-group FRR described in this document could co-
   exist with other FRR solutions, such as LFA/RLFA/TI-LFA.  The
   anycast-group FRR solution needn't complex alternate path
   computation, it just reuses the forwarding information which points
   to the slave boundary node.
