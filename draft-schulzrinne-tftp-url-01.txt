STATUS OF THIS MEMO

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress".

Abstract

   This document defines the tftp URL according to the rules in RFC
   2717.


1 URL Scheme Name

   The scheme name is "tftp".

2 URL Scheme Syntax

   The TFTP URL scheme is used to designate files and directories on
   Internet hosts accessible using the TFTP protocol [1].

   TFTP URLs follow the common Internet scheme syntax described in
   Section 3.1 of RFC 1738 [2]. If ":<port>" is omitted, the port
   defaults to 69. The "user" and "password" components MUST NOT be

   used. No relative forms are supported.

   An example of a TFTP URL is

     tftp://tftp.example.com/directory/file.txt



3 Character Encoding Considerations

   RFC 1350 only allows file names consisting of "netascii" characters
   [3]. The host part of the URL has the same encoding considerations as
   described in RFC 1738 [2].

4 Intended Usage

   The file identified is retrieved (read) from the host and file name
   specified in the URL, using TFTP read requests (RRQ).

5 Protocols which Use This URL Scheme Name

   TFTP (STD 33, RFC 1350 [1])

6 Interoperability considerations

   TFTP mail mode and Netascii modes are not supported. (RFC 1350 states
   that "mail mode is obsolete and should not be implemented or used.")

7 Security Considerations

   The security considerations of RFC 1350 [1] apply. This scheme is
   suitable only for files that are considered public, similar to
   anonymous ftp or public HTTP objects. [TBD: Explain any differences
   to anon. ftp.] For security reasons, this URL does not support the
   TFTP WRQ (write) mode.
