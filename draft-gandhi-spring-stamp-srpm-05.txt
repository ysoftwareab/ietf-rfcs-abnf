Internet-Draft       Using STAMP for Segment Routing       February 2021


1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-
   MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes [RFC8402].  SR takes advantage of
   the Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  SR
   Policies as defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are
   used to steer traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a
   stack of Segments.  Built-in SR Performance Measurement (PM) is one
   of the essential requirements to provide Service Level Agreements
   (SLAs).

   The Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) provides
   capabilities for the measurement of various performance metrics in IP
   networks [RFC8762].  It eliminates the need for control protocol by
   using configuration and management model to provision and manage test
   sessions.  [RFC8972] defines optional extensions for STAMP.
   [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm] defines STAMP extensions for SR
   networks.

   The STAMP supports two modes of STAMP Session-Reflector: Stateless
   and Stateful as described in Section 4 of [RFC8762].  In Stateless
   mode, maintenance of each STAMP test session on Session-Reflector is
   avoided.  In SR networks, as the state is in the packet, the
   signaling of the parameters and creating extra states in the network
   are undesired.  Hence, Stateless mode of Session-Reflector is
   preferred in SR networks.

   This document describes procedures for Performance Measurement in SR
   networks using the mechanisms defined in STAMP [RFC8762] and its
   optional extensions defined in [RFC8972] and
   [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].  The procedure described is applicable
   to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and is used for both links and end-
   to-end SR paths including SR Policies [RFC8402].

   transmits a reply test packet.  The reply test packet is transmitted
   back to the STAMP Session-Sender R1 on the same path or a different
   path in the reverse direction.

   The nodes R1 and R3 may be connected via a link or there exists an SR
   path [RFC8402].  The link may be a physical interface, virtual link,
   or Link Aggregation Group (LAG) [IEEE802.1AX], or LAG member link.
   The SR path may be an SR Policy

3.  Overview

   For performance measurement in SR networks, the STAMP test packets
   defined in [RFC8762] and its optional extensions defined in [RFC8972]
   and [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm] are used as described in this
   document.  The procedures are used to measure one-way, two-way and
   round-trip delay as well as packet loss metrics in an SR network.

   For performance delay and packet loss measurement, STAMP Session-
   Sender test packets are transmitted in-band on the same path as the
   data traffic flow under measurement to measure the delay and packet
   loss experienced by the data traffic flow.  It is also desired that
   Session-Reflector reply test packets are transmitted in-band on the
   same path in the reverse direction.  This is achieved in SR networks
   by using the STAMP extensions defined in
   [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].

   A destination UDP port number is selected as described in [RFC8762].
   The same destination UDP port is used for link and end-to-end SR path
   STAMP test sessions.

3.1.  Example STAMP Reference Model

   An example of a STAMP reference model and typical measurement
   parameters including the destination UDP port for STAMP test session
   is shown in the following Figure 1:

                  Figure 1: Example STAMP Reference Model

   Example of the Timestamp Format is PTPv2 [IEEE1588] and NTP.  Example
   of Delay Measurement Mode is one-way, two-way and round-trip mode as
   described in this document.  Example of Packet Loss Type is round-
   trip packet loss [RFC8762].

   When using the authenticated mode for delay measurement, the matching
   Authentication Type (e.g.  HMAC-SHA-256) and Key are user-configured
   on STAMP Session-Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector [RFC8762].

   The STAMP Session-Reflector R3 uses the timestamp format from the
   received STAMP test packet.  In addition, the STAMP Session-Reflector
   R3 uses the parameters of the return path for the reply test packet
   from the received STAMP test packet, as described in this document.

   Note that the controller in the reference model is not intended for
   signaling the SR parameters for STAMP test sessions between the STAMP
   Session-Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector.  In addition, maintenance
   of each STAMP test session on Session-Reflector and creating extra
   state are avoided in an SR network.

   The YANG data model defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-yang] can be used
   to provision the STAMP Session-Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector.

4.1.1.  Session-Sender Test Packet for Links

   The STAMP Session-Sender test packet as shown in Figure 2 is
   transmitted over the link for delay measurement.  The local and
   remote IP addresses of the link are used as Source and Destination
   Addresses.

4.1.2.  Session-Sender Test Packet for SR Paths

   The delay measurement for end-to-end SR path in SR network is
   applicable to both end-to-end SR-MPLS and SRv6 paths including SR
   Policies.

   The STAMP Session-Sender IPv4 or IPv6 address is used as the Source
   Address.  The SR Policy endpoint IPv4 or IPv6 address is used as the
   Destination Address.

   In the case of Color-Only Destination Steering, with IPv4 endpoint of
   0.0.0.0 or IPv6 endpoint of ::0
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], the loopback address from
   the range 127/8 for IPv4, or the loopback address ::1/128 for IPv6 is
   used as the Destination Address, respectively.

   The Segment List (SL) can be empty in case of a single-hop SR-MPLS
   Policy with Implicit NULL label.

   The Path Segment Identifier (PSID)
   [I-D.ietf-spring-mpls-path-segment] of an SR-MPLS Policy can be
   carried in the MPLS header as shown in Figure 3, and can be used for
   direct measurement as described in Section 7.

4.1.2.2.  Session-Sender Test Packet for SRv6 Policies

   An SRv6 Policy may contain a number of Segment Lists.  A STAMP
   Session-Sender test packet is transmitted for each Segment List of
   the SRv6 Policy.  An SRv6 Policy can contain an SRv6 Segment Routing
   Header (SRH) carrying a Segment List as described in [RFC8754].  The
   content of an example STAMP Session-Sender test packet for an end-to-
   end SRv6 Policy is shown in Figure 4.

   The SRv6 network programming is described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming].  The procedure defined
   for upper-layer header processing for SRv6 SIDs in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming] is used to process the

              Figure 5: Example Session-Reflector Test Packet

4.2.1.  One-way Delay Measurement Mode

   In one-way delay measurement mode, a reply test packet as shown in
   Figure 5 is transmitted by the STAMP Session-Reflector, for both
   links and SR Policies.  The reply test packet may be transmitted on
   the same path or a different path in the reverse direction.

   The STAMP Session-Sender address may not be reachable via IP route
   from the STAMP Session-Reflector.  The STAMP Session-Sender in this
   case can send its reachability path information to the STAMP Session-
   Reflector using the Return Path TLV defined in
   [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].

   In this mode, as per Reference Topology, all timestamps T1, T2, T3,
   and T4 are collected by the test packets.  However, only timestamps
   T1 and T2 are used to measure one-way delay as (T2 - T1).

4.2.2.  Two-way Delay Measurement Mode

   In two-way delay measurement mode, a reply test packet as shown in
   Figure 5 is transmitted by the STAMP Session-Reflector in-band on the
   same path in the reverse direction, e.g. on the reverse direction
   link or associated reverse SR path [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path].

   For two-way delay measurement mode for links, the STAMP Session-
   Reflector needs to transmit the reply test packet in-band on the same
   link where the test packet is received.  The STAMP Session-Sender can
   request in the test packet to the STAMP Session-Reflector to transmit
   the reply test packet back on the same link using the Control Code

   Sub-TLV in the Return Path TLV defined in
   [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].

   For two-way delay measurement mode for end-to-end SR paths, the STAMP
   Session-Reflector needs to transmit the reply test packet in-band on
   a specific reverse path.  The STAMP Session-Sender can request in the
   test packet to the STAMP Session-Reflector to transmit the reply test
   packet back on a given reverse path using a Segment List sub-TLV in
   the Return Path TLV defined in [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].

   In this mode, as per Reference Topology, all timestamps T1, T2, T3,
   and T4 are collected by the test packets.  All four timestamps are
   used to measure two-way delay as ((T4 - T1) - (T3 - T2)).

   The content of an example STAMP Session-Reflector reply test packet

4.2.3.  Round-trip Delay Measurement Mode

   The STAMP Session-Sender test packets are sent in loopback mode to
   measure round-trip delay of a bidirectional path.  The IP header of
   the STAMP Session-Sender test packet contains the Destination Address
   equals to the STAMP Session-Sender address and the Source Address
   equals to the STAMP Session-Reflector address.  Optionally, the STAMP
   Session-Sender test packet can carry the return path information
   (e.g.  return path label stack for SR-MPLS) as part of the SR header.
   This way, the received Session-Sender test packets are not punted out
   of the fast path in forwarding (to slow path or control-plane) at the
   STAMP Session-Reflector.  Also, the Session-Reflector does not
   process them and generate reply test packets.

   As the reply test packet is not generated by the STAMP Session-
   Reflector, the STAMP Session-Sender ignores the 'Session-Sender

   Sequence Number', 'Session-Sender Timestamp', 'Session-Sender Error
   Estimate', and 'Session-Sender TTL' in the received test packet.

   In this mode, as per Reference Topology, the timestamps T1 and T4 are
   collected by the test packets.  Both these timestamps are used to
   measure round-trip delay as (T4 - T1).

4.3.  Delay Measurement for P2MP SR Policies

   The Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) SR path that originates from a root
   node terminates on multiple destinations called leaf nodes (e.g.
   P2MP SR Policy [I-D.ietf-pim-sr-p2mp-policy]).

   The procedures for performance measurement described in this document
   for P2P SR Policies are used for the P2MP SR Policies as listed
   below.

   o  The STAMP Session-Sender root node transmits test packets using
      the Tree-SID defined in [I-D.ietf-pim-sr-p2mp-policy] for the P2MP
      SR-MPLS Policy as shown in Figure 8.  The STAMP Session-Sender
      test packets may contain the replication SID as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-replication-segment].

   o  The Destination Address is set to the loopback address from the
      range 127/8 for IPv4, or the loopback address ::1/128 for IPv6.

   o  Each STAMP Session-Reflector leaf node transmits its node address
      in the Source Address of the reply test packets shown in Figure 5.
      This allows the STAMP Session-Sender root node to identify the
      STAMP Session-Reflector leaf nodes of the P2MP SR Policy.

   o  The P2MP root node measures the delay for each P2MP leaf node
      individually.

   The round-trip delay measurement for a P2MP SR-MPLS Policy can use
   the Node SID of the Session-Sender in the MPLS header of the Session-
   Sender test packet.

4.4.  Additional STAMP Test Packet Processing Rules

   The processing rules described in this section are applicable to the
   STAMP test packets for links and end-to-end SR paths including SR
   Policies.

4.4.1.  TTL

   The TTL field in the IPv4 and MPLS headers of the STAMP Session-
   Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector reply test packets is set to 255,
   except in the following cases.

   When using the Destination IPv4 Address from the range 127/8, the TTL
   field in the IPv4 header is set to 1.

   For link delay, the TTL field in the STAMP test packet is set to 1 in
   one-way and two-way delay measurement modes.

4.4.2.  IPv6 Hop Limit

   The Hop Limit field in the IPv6 and SRH headers of the STAMP Session-
   Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector reply test packets is set to 255,
   except in the following cases.

   When using the Destination IPv6 Address of loopback address ::1/128,
   the Hop Limit field in the IPv6 header is set to 1.

Internet-Draft       Using STAMP for Segment Routing       February 2021


   For link delay, the Hop Limit field in the STAMP test packet is set
   to 1 in one-way and two-way delay measurement modes.

4.4.3.  Router Alert Option

   The Router Alert IP option (RAO) [RFC2113] is not set in the STAMP
   test packets for links and end-to-end SR paths.

5.  Packet Loss Measurement for Links and SR Paths

   The procedure described in Section 4 for delay measurement using
   STAMP test packets can be used to detect (test) packet loss for links
   and end-to-end SR paths.  The Sequence Number field in the STAMP test
   packet is used as described in Section 4 "Theory of Operation" of
   [RFC8762], to detect forward, reverse and round-trip packet loss.

6.  Direct Measurement for Links and SR Paths

   The STAMP "Direct Measurement" TLV (Type 5) defined in [RFC8972] can
   be used in SR networks.  The STAMP test packets with this TLV are
   transmitted using the procedures described in Section 4 to collect
   the transmit and receive counters of the data flow for the links and
   end-to-end SR paths.  Note that in this case, the STAMP test packets
   may follow the same or a different path than the data flow under
   direct measurement.

   The PSID carried in the received data packet for the traffic flow
   under measurement can be used to measure receive data packets for
   end-to-end SR path on the STAMP Session-Reflector.  The PSID in the
   received Session-Sender test packet header can be used to associate
   the receive traffic counter on the Session-Reflector for the end-to-
   end SR path.

7.  Session Status for Links and SR Paths

   The STAMP test session status allows to know if the performance
   measurement is active on the links and end-to-end SR paths.  The
   STAMP test session status initially is declared succeeded when one or
   more reply test packets are received at the STAMP Session-Sender.
   The STAMP test session status is declared failed when consecutive N
   number of reply test packets are not received at the STAMP Session-
   Sender, where N is locally provisioned value.

8.  ECMP Support for SR Policies

   An SR Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.
   Usage of Anycast SID [RFC8402] by an SR Policy can result in ECMP



Gandhi, et al.           Expires August 14, 2021               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft       Using STAMP for Segment Routing       February 2021


   paths via transit nodes part of that Anycast group.  The test packets
   need to be transmitted to traverse different ECMP paths to measure
   delay of an SR Policy.

   Forwarding plane has various hashing functions available to forward
   packets on specific ECMP paths.  The mechanisms described in
   [RFC8029] and [RFC5884] for handling ECMPs are also applicable to the
   delay measurement.

   In IPv4 header of the STAMP Session-Sender test packets, sweeping of
   Destination Address from the range 127/8 can be used to exercise
   particular ECMP paths.  Note that in the loopback mode for round-trip
   delay measurement, both the forward and the return paths must be SR-
   MPLS paths in this case.

   As specified in [RFC6437], Flow Label field in the outer IPv6 header
   can also be used for sweeping to exercise different IPv6 ECMP paths.

   The "Destination Node Address" TLV [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm] can
   be carried in the STAMP Session-Sender test packet to identify the
   intended destination node, for example, when using IPv4 Destination
   Address from the range 127/8.  The STAMP Session-Reflector must not
   transmit reply test packet if it is not the intended destination node
   in the "Destination Node Address" TLV [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].

9.  Security Considerations

   The performance measurement is intended for deployment in well-
   managed private and service provider networks.  As such, it assumes
   that a node involved in a measurement operation has previously
   verified the integrity of the path and the identity of the far-end
   STAMP Session-Reflector.

   If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic validation
   and sanity checks, at the STAMP Session-Sender, of the counter or
   timestamp fields in received measurement reply test packets.  The
   minimal state associated with these protocols also limits the extent
   of measurement disruption that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid
   packet to a single test cycle.

   Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the authenticated mode protects the data
   integrity of the test packets.  SRv6 has HMAC protection
   authentication defined for SRH [RFC8754].  Hence, test packets for
   SRv6 may not need authentication mode.  Cryptographic measures may be
   enhanced by the correct configuration of access-control lists and
   firewalls.

   The security considerations specified in [RFC8762] and [RFC8972] also
   apply to the procedures described in this document.

   This document does not require any IANA action.
