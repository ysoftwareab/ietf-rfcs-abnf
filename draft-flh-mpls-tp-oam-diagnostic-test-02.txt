    Internet-Draft    Diagnostic tool-test for MPLS-TP   November 30, 2010 
        

    1. Introduction 

       MPLS-TP is technology of packet transport network, which requirement 
       is defined in MPLS-TP requirement [2], and OAM is its most important 
       function. MPLS-TP OAM requirement [3] define diagnostic tools that 
       MAY be used for PW, LSP and Section, such as consists in looping the 
       traffic at an Intermediate Point or End point back to the originating 
       End Point-loopback.  And another example of such diagnostic tool-test 
       (TST) consists in estimating the bandwidth or throughput of transport 
       path e.g., an LSP. 

       This document defines one diagnostic tool-TST (test) for bandwidth 
       estimating, measuring or verifying. And it describes TST OAM frame 
       format and the procedures for the transmission, receive of such OAM 
       frames. 

       The TST function SHOULD be performed between End Points of PWs, LSPs 
       and Sections.

    3. Mechanics of TST 

    3.1. General Requirements 

       The proposed test tool can be used to perform one-way or two way on-
       demand in-service or out-of-service diagnostics tests, which include 
       verifying throughput. Throughput in this document refers a capacity 
       in terms of line rate; it is the amount of bits observed passing a 
       point during a time interval. 

       When the involved ingress and egress end nodes are configured to 
       perform such tests, a MEP at the respective network layer, eg LSP 
       tunnel, PW,  inserts packets with MPLS-TP test information with 
       specified throughput, packet size and transmission data patterns. For 
       the one way test, the remote MEP receives the packet and calculates 
       the packet loss. For the two way test, the remote MEP loops the 
       packet back to the originating MEP, which calculates the packet loss. 
       The configuration can be done via the management plane or via the 
       control plane. The definition how this is achieved is out side the 
       scope of this draft. 

        

       The out-of-service MPLS-TP test function is service affecting, as the 
       test function puts the remote MEP associated with the diagnosed 
       entity into a LOCK, to make sure that the all the frames; including 
       any user or client data frames and TST frames, are properly looped 
       back to the ingress MEP. The source MEP configured for the out-of-
       service test transmits LCK packets in the immediate client (sub-) 
       layer.   Once the LCk is acknowledged, the source MEP gradually 
       increase TST packet bandwidth either via increasing the transmit rate 
       or via increasing frame size, until hitting a preconfigured/defined 
       threshold TST packet traffic loss rate. 

       For the in-service MPLS-TP test function the user data traffic is not 
       disrupted and the MPLS-TP test packets are transmitted such that an 
       only limited part of the service bandwidth is utilized. The rate and

    Internet-Draft    Diagnostic tool-test for MPLS-TP   November 30, 2010 
        

       QoS of transmission for TST packets is pre-determined for in-service 
       MPLS-TP test function. The maximum rate at which TST packets can be 
       sent without adversely impacting the data traffic for an in-service 
       is should be calculated carefully. 

       Observe TST packet that are transmitted, delivered, and or rejected        
       on a PW, LSP or Section. When detect threshold of packet loss rate,        
       calculated the throughput.  

       Note: need to explicitly indicate that the test is between two MEPs 
       and that testing is only done between those two points. 

        

       In order to support TST, a Test TLV in TST PDU should be defined: 

       Test TLV - Optional element whose length and contents are 
       configurable at the MEP. The contents can be a test pattern and an 
       optional checksum. Examples of test patterns include pseudo-random 
       bit sequence (PRBS) (231-1) as specified in sub-clause 5.8 of ITU-T 
       O.150 [4], all '0' pattern, etc.  

       At the transmitting MEP, provisioning is required for a test signal 
       generator which is associated with the MEP. At a receiving MEP, 
       provisioning is required for a test signal detector which is 
       associated with the MEP.  

       A MIP is transparent to the TST packets and therefore does not 
       require any provisioning to support MPLS-TP test functionality. 

       A MEP inserts TST packets towards its peer MEPs. The receiving MEP 
       detects these TST packets and performs the intended measurements. 

    3.2. Transmission 

       A test signal generator connected to a MEP can transmit TST packets 
       as often as the test signal generator configuration. Each TST packet 
       is transmitted with a specific Sequence Number. A different Sequence 
       Number must be used for every TST packet, and no Sequence Number from 
       the same MEP may be repeated within one minute. 

       When a MEP is configured for an out-of-service test, the MEP also 
       generates LCK packets in the same direction where TST packets are 
       transmitted.  And TST packet transmission rate should be increased 
       gradually by step of x Kb/s and recorded TST packet transmitted, 
       delivered or rejected. This is shown in Figure 1:

       LCK is configured by management, When an administrative/diagnostic 
       lock is applied on a MEG, the related MEPs continues to periodically 
       (once per 1s) transmit packets with LCK information until the 
       administrative/diagnostic condition is removed. This allows a client 
       MEP receiving packets with LCK information to differentiate between 
       traffic interruption due to a defect condition and an administrative 
       locking action at the server (sub-) layer MEP.  

       In case of testing protection path status when it is used in 
       protection switch, QoS of TST packet is setup as same as packet in 
       work path.

       increased gradually by step of x Kb/s, but it is less than Maximum 
       bit rate. In order to verify the throughput, QoS of test packet 
       should be considered, color, CIR/EIR should be carefully calculated 
       in order not to impact the service.  

       TST configuration message is used to define TST data packet's 
       information including send rate, duration, length etc. 

       TST record message is sending once at end of duration to record send 
       packet number, received packet number, and total duration is used, in 
       order to detect packet loss rate. 

       In order to test in line, TST configuration and record message 
       carrying TST packet information in performance counter such as send 
       rate, duration etc is defined. And TST packet that is transmitted 
       MUST be also recorded by traffic condition performance monitor 
       counter. 

       The details will be updated in the next version. 

    3.3. Receive 

       If the receiving MEP is configured for MPLS-TP test function, the 
       test signal detector connected to the MEP detects bit errors or 
       packet loss rate from e.g. the pseudo-random bit sequence of the 
       received TST packets and reports such errors.  

       Further, when the receiving MEP is configured for an out-of-service 
       test, it also generates LCK packets a in the direction where the TST 
       packets are received. Detected the packet loss rates or bit errors of 
       test packet, and record the rate of test packet transmission or 
       rejected.  

       When the receiving MEP is configured for an in service test, no any 
       LCK packet is generated. At same time, record all service packet 
       counters of transmitted, delivered, and or rejected.  

        

    4. TST data packet 

       TST PDUs are encapsulated by using the ACH, according to RFC 5586 [5].

       The fields of the Test TLV format are as follows: 

       Type: 1 octet, the value for this TLV type is Test (32) 

       Length: 2 octets, Identifies size, in octets, of the Value field 
       containing the Test Pattern and the optional CRC-32 field.

       Pattern Type: 1 octet, identifies the Test pattern type; values are 
       defined in Table  

            0x00     Null (all-zeroes) pattern without CRC-32 
            0x01     Null (all-zeroes) pattern with CRC-32 
            0x02     PRBS 2-31-1 pattern without CRC-32 
            0x03     PRBS 2-31-1 pattern with CRC-32 
            0x04-0xFF 
                     Reserved for future standardization 
       Test Pattern: n octets, an n-octet (n  Length) test pattern as 
       identified by the Pattern Type. 

       CRC-32: 4 octets, an optional field, contains the CRC-32 calculated 
       over all fields (from Type to last octet before CRC-32) 

        

    5. Security Considerations 

       Refer to draft-fang-mpls-tp-security-framework [6] 

       Mechanisms SHOULD be provided to ensure that unauthorized access is 
       prevented from triggering any TST function. 

       This will prevent unauthorized access to vital equipment and it will 
       prevent third parties from learning about sensitive information about 
       the transport network. 

       TST messages MAY be authenticated. 

        

    6. IANA Considerations 

       There is one channel type for TST by IANA actions required by this 
       draft.
