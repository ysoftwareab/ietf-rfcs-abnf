   appeal is being considered.

1.  Introduction

   [[OK: comments between double square brackets, such as this one, are
   open questions or editorial notes]]

   Section 6.5 of RFC 2026 [RFC2026] outlines how conflicts in the IETF
   should be resolved and describes how matters can be resolved by
   appealing decisions at IESG and IAB level.  The appeal mechanism has
   proven to be an important mechanism for maintaining an open nature of
   the IETF standards process.

   It has been argued that appeals put an asymmetric workload on the
   bodies that handle the appeal.  It has also been argued that the
   appeal process has been abused to stall forward
   progress[MontrealPlenary].  Therefore it is required that an
   appellant has to gain support for entering the appeal process from at
   least 3 [[OK: TBD]] active IETF participants for an appeal to be
   considered.  This requirement should lower the likelihood that the
   appeal process will be abused by individuals while still maintaining
   an open and accessible process for conflict resolution.

   In this document we will use the term "supporter".  This is a person
   with an active IETF background (see below).  The supporter only
   supports that the matter at hand should be reviewed by the
   responsible boards -- IESG or IAB.  Their support for entering the
   appeal process should in no way be seen as (non)support for (the view
   of) the appellant but more for the fact that time of the responsible
   review boards is to be spent on the issue.

   Below we describe how this requirement is integrated in the process
   steps and what makes a supporter qualify.

   [[OK: There are several ways this document can go.  We can perform a
   process experiment [RFC3933] based on this or it could be merged into
   a document describing all off the dispute resolution, see
   [I-D.carpenter-ietf-disputes].]]


2.  Qualifying Supporters

   Supporters are intended to have a reasonable IETF experience.  They
   are supposed to be active participants that know the IETF community.
   The same selection criteria as for the NOMCOM are used:

   Members of the IETF community must have attended at least 3 of the
   last 5 IETF meetings in order to be a supporter.

   The 5 meetings are the five most recent meetings to the date on which

   the appeal is being filed.  If the appeal is filed during a meeting
   that meeting is included.

   To keep the dispute resolution as open as possible the group of
   potential supporters may include members of the IESG, the IAB.
   Working group chairs may also act as supporters.

   Qualifying supporters may not have supported the same appellant
   during a previous appeal.  Qualifying supporters may have supported
   other appellants.  [[OK: The intention is to have an "indefinite"
   time-out.  It could be possible to take a 5 year window ]].

   Appelants may act as a supporter for their own appeal when they meet
   the above criterea.  As a result they can only self-support once.


3.  Mechanics

   Introducing the requirement for 3 supporters also introduces some
   additional mechanics in the process.  The two normative changes to
   the process described in RFC 2026 are that

   o  three supporters must have filed their support with the appeal
      body at most 2 [TBD] weeks after the appeal has been received by
      that body;

   o  the appeal body may choose to not consider the appeal if there are
      not sufficient supporters or if the supporters do not qualify as
      described above.

   Note that the appeal body may choose to consider an appeal even when
   there are not sufficient supporters.

   It is the responsibility of the appellant to find qualifying
   supporters.  In order to find qualifying support the appellant may
   send a single message to the public ietf list and when relevant, to a
   working group list.

   Supporters should send their supporting messages personally to the
   appeal body in question and should not proxy their message through
   the appellant.

   If an appellant escalates an appeal from the IESG to the IAB that
   appellant will need to find new supporters.

4.  conclusions

   The mechanism proposed herein only applies to appeals to the IESG and
   the IAB.  It does not apply to other forms of dispute resolution.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies neither a protocol nor an operational
   practice, and as such, it creates no new security considerations.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates a no new requirements on IANA namespaces
   [RFC2434].
