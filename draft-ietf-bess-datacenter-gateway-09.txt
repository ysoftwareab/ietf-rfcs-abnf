   Gateway Auto-Discovery and Route Advertisement for Segment Routing
                     Enabled Domain Interconnection
                 draft-ietf-bess-datacenter-gateway-09

Abstract

   Data centers are critical components of the infrastructure used by
   network operators to provide services to their customers.  Data
   centers are attached to the Internet or a backbone network by gateway
   routers.  One data center typically has more than one gateway for
   commercial, load balancing, and resiliency reasons.

   Segment Routing is a protocol mechanism that can be used within a
   data center, and also for steering traffic that flows between two
   data center sites.  In order that one data center site may load
   balance the traffic it sends to another data center site, it needs to
   know the complete set of gateway routers at the remote data center,
   the points of connection from those gateways to the backbone network,
   and the connectivity across the backbone network.

   Segment Routing may also be operated in other domains, such as access
   networks.  Those domains also need to be connected across backbone
   networks through gateways.

   This document defines a mechanism using the BGP Tunnel Encapsulation
   attribute to allow each gateway router to advertise the routes to the
   prefixes in the Segment Routing domains to which it provides access,
   and also to advertise on behalf of each other gateway to the same
   Segment Routing domain.

Internet-Draft               SR DC Gateways                 January 2021


1.  Introduction

   Data centers (DCs) are critical components of the infrastructure used
   by network operators to provide services to their customers.  DCs are
   attached to the Internet or a backbone network by gateway routers
   (GWs).  One DC typically has more than one GW for various reasons
   including commercial preferences, load balancing, or resiliency
   against connection of device failure.

   Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] is a protocol mechanism that can be
   used within a DC, and also for steering traffic that flows between
   two DC sites.  In order for a source (ingress) DC that uses SR to
   load balance the flows it sends to a destination (egress) DC, it
   needs to know the complete set of entry nodes (i.e., GWs) for that
   egress DC from the backbone network connecting the two DCs.  Note
   that it is assumed that the connected set of DCs and the backbone
   network connecting them are part of the same SR BGP Link State (LS)
   instance ([RFC7752] and [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe]) so
   that traffic engineering using SR may be used for these flows.

   SR may also be operated in other domains, such as access networks.
   Those domains also need to be connected across backbone networks
   through gateways.  For illustrative purposes, consider the Ingress
   and Egress SR Domains shown in Figure 1 as separate ASes.  The
   various ASes that provide connectivity between the Ingress and Egress
   Domains could each be constructed differently and use different
   technologies such as IP, MPLS with global table routing native BGP to
   the edge, MPLS IP VPN, SR-MPLS IP VPN, or SRv6 IP VPN.

   Suppose that there are two gateways, GW1 and GW2 as shown in
   Figure 1, for a given egress SR domain and that they each advertise a
   route to prefix X which is located within the egress SR domain with
   each setting itself as next hop.  One might think that the GWs for X
   could be inferred from the routes' next hop fields, but typically it
   is not the case that both routes get distributed across the backbone:
   rather only the best route, as selected by BGP, is distributed.  This
   precludes load balancing flows across both GWs.

         Figure 1: Example Segment Routing Domain Interconnection

   The obvious solution to this problem is to use the BGP feature that
   allows the advertisement of multiple paths in BGP (known as Add-
   Paths) [RFC7911] to ensure that all routes to X get advertised by
   BGP.  However, even if this is done, the identity of the GWs will be
   lost as soon as the routes get distributed through an Autonomous
   System Border Router (ASBR) that will set itself to be the next hop.
   And if there are multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes) in the backbone,
   not only will the next hop change several times, but the Add-Paths
   technique will experience scaling issues.  This all means that the
   Add-Paths approach is limited to SR domains connected over a single
   AS.

   This document defines a solution that overcomes this limitation and
   works equally well with a backbone constructed from one or more ASes
   using the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps]
   as follows:

      When a GW to a given SR domain advertises a route to a prefix X
      within that SR domain, it will include a Tunnel Encapsulation
      attribute that contains the union of the Tunnel Encapsulation



Farrel, et al.            Expires July 9, 2021                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               SR DC Gateways                 January 2021


      attributes advertised by each of the GWs to that SR domain,
      including itself.

   In other words, each route advertised by a GW identifies all of the
   GWs to the same SR domain (see Section 3 for a discussion of how GWs
   discover each other).  Therefore, even if only one of the routes is
   distributed to other ASes, it will not matter how many times the next
   hop changes, as the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute (and its remote
   endpoint sub-TLVs identifying the GWs) will remain unchanged.

   To put this in the context of Figure 1, GW1 and GW2 discover each
   other as gateways for the egress SR domain.  Both GW1 and GW2
   advertise themselves as having routes to prefix X.  Furthermore, GW1
   includes a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute which is the union of its
   Tunnel Encapsulation attribute and GW2's Tunnel Encapsulation
   attribute.  Similarly, GW2 includes a Tunnel Encapsulation which is
   the union of its Tunnel Encapsulation attribute and GW1's Tunnel
   encapsulation attribute.  The gateway in the ingress SR domain can
   now see all possible paths to the egress SR domain regardless of
   which route is propagated to it, and it can choose one, or balance
   traffic flows as it sees fit.

   The solution defined in this document can be seen in the broader
   context of SR domain interconnection in
   [I-D.farrel-spring-sr-domain-interconnect].  That document shows how
   other existing protocol elements may be combined with the solution
   defined in this document to provide a full system, but is not a
   necessary reference for understanding this document.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  SR Domain Gateway Auto-Discovery

   To allow a given SR domain's GWs to auto-discover each other and to
   coordinate their operations, the following procedures are
   implemented:

   o  Each GW is configured with an identifier for the SR domain.  That
      identifier is common across all GWs to the domain (i.e., the same
      identifier is used by all GWs to the same SR domain), and unique
      across all SR domains that are connected (i.e., across all GWs to
      all SR domains that are interconnected).



Farrel, et al.            Expires July 9, 2021                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               SR DC Gateways                 January 2021


   o  A route target ([RFC4360]) is attached to each GW's auto-discovery
      route and has its value set to the SR domain identifier.

   o  Each GW constructs an import filtering rule to import any route
      that carries a route target with the same SR domain identifier
      that the GW itself uses.  This means that only these GWs will
      import those routes, and that all GWs to the same SR domain will
      import each other's routes and will learn (auto-discover) the
      current set of active GWs for the SR domain.

   The auto-discovery route that each GW advertises consists of the
   following:

   o  An IPv4 or IPv6 NLRI containing one of the GW's loopback addresses
      (that is, with an AFI/SAFI pair that is one of 1/1, 2/1, 1/4, or
      2/4).

   o  A Tunnel Encapsulation attribute [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps]
      containing the GW's encapsulation information.

   To avoid the side effect of applying the Tunnel Encapsulation
   attribute to any packet that is addressed to the GW itself, the GW
   SHOULD use a different loopback address for the two cases.

   As described in Section 1, each GW will include a Tunnel
   Encapsulation attribute with the GW encapsulation information for
   each of the SR domain's active GWs (including itself) in every route
   advertised externally to that SR domain.  As the current set of
   active GWs changes (due to the addition of a new GW or the failure/
   removal of an existing GW) each externally advertised route will be
   re-advertised with a new Tunnel Encapsulation attribute which
   reflects current set of active GWs.

   If a gateway becomes disconnected from the backbone network, or if
   the SR domain operator decides to terminate the gateway's activity,
   it withdraws the advertisements described above.  This means that
   remote gateways at other sites will stop seeing advertisements from
   this gateway.

   Note that if a GW is (mis)configured with a different SR domain
   identifier from the other GWs to the same domain then it will not be
   auto-discovered by the other GWs (and will not auto-discover the
   other GWs).  This would result in a GW for another SR domain
   receiving only the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute included in the BGP
   best route; i.e., the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute of the
   (mis)configured GW or that of the other GWs.

4.  Relationship to BGP Link State and Egress Peer Engineering

   When a remote GW receives a route to a prefix X it can use the SR
   tunnel instances within the contained Tunnel Encapsulation attribute
   to identify the GWs through which X can be reached.  It uses this
   information to compute SR Traffic Engineering (SR TE) paths across
   the backbone network looking at the information advertised to it in
   SR BGP Link State (BGP-LS) [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-ls-segment-routing-ext]
   and correlated using the SR domain identity.  SR Egress Peer
   Engineering (EPE) [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe] can be
   used to supplement the information advertised in BGP-LS.

5.  Advertising an SR Domain Route Externally

   When a packet destined for prefix X is sent on an SR TE path to a GW
   for the SR domain containing X (that is, the packet is sent in the
   Ingress Domain on an SR TE path that describes the path including
   within the Egress Domain), it needs to carry the receiving GW's label
   for X such that this label rises to the top of the stack before the
   GW completes its processing of the packet.  To achieve this, we place
   a Prefix SID sub-TLV [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] for X in each SR
   tunnel instance in the Tunnel Encapsulation attribute in the
   externally advertised route for X.

   Alternatively, if the GWs for a given SR domain are configured to
   allow remote GWs to perform SR TE through that SR domain for a prefix
   X, then each GW computes an SR TE path through that SR domain to X
   from each of the currently active GWs, and places each in an MPLS
   label stack sub-TLV [I-D.ietf-idr-tunnel-encaps] in the SR tunnel
   instance for that GW.

   Please refer to Section 7 of
   [I-D.farrel-spring-sr-domain-interconnect] for worked examples of how
   the label stack is constructed in this case, and how the
   advertisements would work.

6.  Encapsulation

   If the GWs for a given SR domain are configured to allow remote GWs
   to send them a packet in that SR domain's native encapsulation, then
   each GW will also include multiple instances of a tunnel TLV for that
   native encapsulation in externally advertised routes: one for each GW
   and each containing a remote endpoint sub-TLV with that GW's address.
   A remote GW may then encapsulate a packet according to the rules
   defined via the sub-TLVs included in each of the tunnel TLV
   instances.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests for IANA action.

8.  Security Considerations

   From a protocol point of view, the mechanisms described in this
   document can leverage the security mechanisms already defined for
   BGP.  Further discussion of security considerations for BGP may be
   found in the BGP specification itself [RFC4271] and in the security
   analysis for BGP [RFC4272].  The original discussion of the use of
   the TCP MD5 signature option to protect BGP sessions is found in
   [RFC5925], while [RFC6952] includes an analysis of BGP keying and
   authentication issues.

   The mechanisms described in this document involve sharing routing or
   reachability information between domains: that may mean disclosing
   information that is normally contained within a domain.  So it needs
   to be understood that normal security paradigms based on the
   boundaries of domains are weakened.  Discussion of these issues with
   respect to VPNs can be found in [RFC4364], while [RFC7926] describes
   many of the issues associated with the exchange of topology or TE
   information between domains.

   Particular exposures resulting from this work include:

   o  Gateways to a domain will know about all other gateways to the
      same domain.  This feature applies within a domain and so is not a
      substantial exposure, but it does mean that if the BGP exchanges
      within a domain can be snooped or if a gateway can be subverted
      then an attacker may learn the full set of gateways to a domain.
      This would facilitate more effective attacks on that domain.

   o  The existence of multiple gateways to a domain becomes more
      visible across the backbone and even into remote domains.  This
      means that an attacker is able to prepare a more comprehensive
      attack than exists when only the locally attached backbone network
      (e.g., the AS that hosts the domain) can see all of the gateways
      to a site.  For example, a Denial of Service attack on a single GW
      is mitigated by the existence of other GWs, but if the attacker
      knows about all the gateways then the whole set can be attacked at
      once.

   o  A node in a domain that does not have external BGP peering (i.e.,
      is not really a domain gateway and cannot speak BGP into the
      backbone network) may be able to get itself advertised as a
      gateway by letting other genuine gateways discover it (by speaking
      BGP to them within the domain) and so may get those genuine



Farrel, et al.            Expires July 9, 2021                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               SR DC Gateways                 January 2021


      gateways to advertise it as a gateway into the backbone network.
      This would allow the malicious node to attract traffic without
      having to have secure BGP peerings with out-of-domain nodes.

   o  If it is possible to modify a BGP message within the backbone, it
      may be possible to spoof the existence of a gateway.  This could
      cause traffic to be attracted to a specific node and might result
      in black-holing of traffic.

   All of the issues in the list above could cause disruption to domain
   interconnection, but are not new protocol vulnerabilities so much as
   new exposures of information that SHOULD be protected against using
   existing protocol mechanisms.  Furthermore, it is a general
   observation that if these attacks are possible then it is highly
   likely that far more significant attacks can be made on the routing
   system.  It should be noted that BGP peerings are not discovered, but
   always arise from explicit configuration.

9.  Manageability Considerations

   The principal configuration item added by this solution is the
   allocation of an SR domain identifier.  The same identifier MUST be
   assigned to every GW to the same domain, and each domain MUST have a
   different identifier.  This requires coordination, probably through a
   central management agent.

   It should be noted that BGP peerings are not discovered, but always
   arise from explicit configuration.  This is no different from any
   other BGP operation.

9.1.  Relationship to Route Target Constraint

   In order to limit the VPN routing information that is maintained at a
   given route reflector, [RFC4364] suggests the use of "Cooperative
   Route Filtering" [RFC5291] between route reflectors.  [RFC4684]
   defines an extension to that mechanism to include support for
   multiple autonomous systems and asymmetric VPN topologies such as
   hub-and-spoke.  The mechanism in RFC 4684 is known as Route Target
   Constraint (RTC).

   An operator would not normally configure RTC by default for any AFI/
   SAFI combination, and would only enable it after careful
   consideration.  When using the mechanisms defined in this document,
   the operator should consider carefully the effects of filtering
   routes.  In some cases this may be desirable, and in others it could
   limit the effectiveness of the procedures.
