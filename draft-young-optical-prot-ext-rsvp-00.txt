Abstract 
    
   With this extension to the RSVP-TE protocol, an optical path can be 
   initiated with a requested maximum path restoration notification 
   time, and signalling nodes which make up the path can determine 
   compliance with this requirement and then establish the path.

Summary for Sub-IP related Internet Drafts 
    
   RELATED DOCUMENTS: 
    
   This protocol enhancement would be an addition to the RSVP-TE 
   enhancements already defined in draft-ietf-mpls-generalized-rsvp-te-
   06.txt 
    
   WHERE DOES IT FIT IN THE PICTURE OF THE SUB-IP WORK 
    
   This ID is intended for the CCAMP WG. 
    
   WHY IS IT TARGETED AT THIS WG(s) 
    
   CCAMP is defining protocol extensions for GMPLS to support optical 
   switching. 
    
   JUSTIFICATION 
    
   This draft specifically addresses two CCAMP WG work items: 
    
   - Define signalling protocols and measurement protocols such that 
   they support multiple physical path and tunnel technologies (e.g. O-
   O and O-E-O optical switches, ATM and Frame Relay switches, MPLS, 
   GRE) using input from technology-specific working groups such as 
   MPLS, IPO, etc.  
    
   - Abstract link and path properties needed for link and path 
   protection. Define signalling mechanisms for path protection, 
   diverse routing and fast path restoration. Ensure that multi-layer 
   path protection and restoration functions are achievable using the 
   defined signalling and measurement protocols, either separately or 
   in combination. 
    
Background 
    
   An optical path is requested and established using RSVP [RFC 2205] 
   and its generalized MPLS TE extensions [RSVP_GEN]. 
    
   For path restoration [GMPLS_ARCH], a failure is indicated to the 
   head and the tail of the path via the RSVP NOTIFY message. These 
   nodes switch traffic onto an already established backup path. 
    
Path Request Service Scenario 
    
   The node initiating the path request indicates that failure 
   notification from any failure site should propagate to the head and 
   the tail of the path within a specified time limit.

Signalling Scenario Description 
    
   It is assumed that for a network where restoration performance is 
   important, mechanisms are in place [RFC 2598] to assure that 
   signalling delays are bounded and deterministic. Upstream and 
   downstream directions are relative to path establishment. 
    
   A signalling node (SN) controls one or more switching elements (SE). 
   Path establishment signalling is between SNs, while the path is 
   established by connections through the SEs. If the SN and SE(s) are 
   separate, some unspecified communication mechanism is used. 
    
                           A +-----+ B 
                -------------|  SN |---------- Control Plane Signalling 
                             +-----+ 
                            /   |   \ 
                           /    |    \ 
                        C /     |     \ 
                    +----+   +-----+   +----+ 
                ----| SE |---|  SE |---| SE |---- User Plane Connection 
                    +----+   +-----+   +----+ 
    
   The time required to indicate failure from the switching element 
   through the signalling node in the upstream direction (C->A) is 
   called UPSTREAM_FAIL_DELAY, and in the downstream direction (C->B) 
   DOWNSTREAM_FAIL_DELAY. In the case of multiple switching elements 
   controlled by a single signalling node, it is the worst case value. 
    
   The time to forward a failure notification through the signalling 
   node in the upstream direction (B->A) is called 
   UPSTREAM_TRANSIT_DELAY, and DOWNSTREAM_TRANSIT_DELAY in the 
   downstream direction (A->B). 
 
   Each signalling node must have knowledge of the delays associated 
   with failure notification and notification forwarding, in the 
   upstream and downstream directions. 
    
   The initiating node indicates the NOTIFICATION_LIMIT in the PATH 
   message, and its values for UPSTREAM_FAIL_DELAY, 
   UPSTREAM_TRANSIT_DELAY, DOWNSTREAM_FAIL_DELAY and 
   DOWNSTREAM_TRANSIT_DELAY. 
    
   A signalling node which does not support the performance request 
   clears the path request. 
    
   Each signalling node in the path appends its values of 
   UPSTREAM_FAIL_DELAY, UPSTREAM_TRANSIT_DELAY, DOWNSTREAM_FAIL_DELAY 
   and DOWNSTREAM_TRANSIT_DELAY to the PATH message. 
    
   The destination node checks that the failure notification time from 
   any fail site to the head or the tail is below the specified limit, 
   otherwise clearing the path request.

Signalling Protocol Extension 
    
   The initiating node adds the ProtectionNotification object to the 
   PATH message:

   The PROT_NOTIF Class-Num has the two high order bits zero. Limit and 
   delay values are in seconds, floating point. Only the initiating 
   node provides NOTIFICATION_LIMIT. 
    
   Downstream nodes append their delay values to the 
   ProtectionNotification object and modify its Length:

Signalling Protocol Handling 
    
   Any node which does not recognize the ProtectionNotification object 
   MUST reject the path request with the "Unknown Object Class" error. 
    
   The path has control nodes 1 to n. The final signalling node (node 
   n) performs calculations on the ProtectionNotification object data. 
    
   For each node i in the path, where 0 < i < n: 
   DownStreamDelay[i] = DOWNSTREAM_FAIL_DELAY[i] + sum of 
   DOWNSTREAM_TRANSIT_DELAY[j] for i < j < n. 
    
   For each node i in the path, where 1 < i < n+1: 
   UpStreamDelay[i] = UPSTREAM_FAIL_DELAY [i] + sum of 
   UPSTREAM_TRANSIT_DELAY [j] for 1 < j < i. 
    
   If any of DownStreamDelay[i] or UpStreamDelay[i] values are greater 
   than NOTIFICATION_LIMIT, the path request MUST be rejected with the 
   "Traffic Control Error". 
    
   Otherwise, path establishment continues.
