                     I2RS Traffic Steering Use Case
                     draft-chen-i2rs-ts-use-case-01

Abstract

   Traffic steering (TS) mechanisms are designed to improve the overall
   utilization of network resources in terms of bandwidth and services,
   and to optimize traffic flow in terms of latency and jitter through
   the network.  Most existing TS systems require human intervention to
   monitor and manage the assignment of specific paths to specific flows
   or traffic types, reducing the effectiveness of TS.  I2RS, as a near
   real time programmatic interface to the routing system, provides the
   ability to manage TS systems in a more dynamic and iterative way.
   This document describes several TS use cases for I2RS.

1.  Introduction

   Interface to Routing System (I2RS) architecture
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] defines a standard, programmatic
   interface to routing system.  Through the I2RS interface, an entity
   external to the routing system can retrieve and program network
   states of the routing system, hence affecting packet forwarding
   behaviours.

   Well designed Traffic Steering (TS) can improve the usage of network
   bandwidth resource, reduce the network congestion and satisfy the
   requirements (e.g., loss and delay) of the applications.  Policy
   Routing (PR), MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) [RFC3209] are useful
   tools for traffic steering deployed in the field.  Segment Routing
   (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm for packet forwarding,
   reducing the per flow state in transit devices to provide a scalable
   TR solution [I-D.filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing].  A BGP specific use

Internet-Draft              I2RS TS Use Case                   July 2014


   case similar to the more general use cases considered here is
   described in section 3.4 of [I-D.keyupate-i2rs-bgp-usecases].

   Most of the existing TS solutions need human intervention because
   they lack dynamic feedback which would facilitate programmatic
   adjustments to the policies impacting packet flows.  This document
   describes use cases that leverage the I2RS interface to perform
   traffic steering dynamically and automatically.

2.  I2RS Requirements from the Traffic Steering Use Cases

   This section contains the list of I2RS requirements found in this
   draft.  Each of these requirements has been given an an ID number of
   TS-REQ-nn for ease of reference.

   The requirements from the Traffic Steering use cases described in
   this document are:

      TS-REQ01: The I2RS Client-Agent must be able to collect the
      topology (especially the exit links) and the traffic load of each
      link;

      TS-REQ02: The I2RS Client-Agent must be able to read the local rib
      of each DC/Metro gateway and the policies deployed on each
      gateway;

      TS-REQ03: The I2RS Client-Agent must be able to add or delete or
      modify the relevant rib items and relevant polices to steer the
      traffic as expected; and adjust traffic placement.

      TS-REQ-04: The I2RS Client-Agent must have the ability to collect
      the LSP information either from the PCE or directly from network
      devices;

      TS-REQ-05: The I2RS Client-Agent must have the ability to collect
      the traffic matrix of the network, this is used to help the I2RS
      client to determine how to adjust the traffic placement;

      TS-REQ-06: The I2RS Client-Agent must have the ability to read the
      rib information and relevant policies of each network node;

      TS-REQ-07:collect the topology and segment information needed to
      help the I2RS client to compute the end-to-end path;

      TS-REQ-08:read rib (especially the segment routing rib)
      information;

      TS-REQ-09: add/delete/modify the segment rib, this finally
      determines how the traffic is forwarded.

   Note: In each of these sections, the requirements match the technical
   specificaiton, but maybe listed of ascending numerical order.

3.  Domain Exit Traffic Steering

   Data Center (DC) fabrics and metro area networks often have more than
   one exit point.  By enforcing relevant policies, it is possible to
   share the outbound traffic load among these exit points, in turn
   preventing a single link from becoming overloaded, and thus improving
   the experience of customers using these facilities.  The figure below
   illustrates a typical network design with multiple exits.

             +---+   +---+   +---+
               | A |   | B |   | C |     Interconnect
               +/--+   +-/-+   +-\-+
               / \      /\      / \
     ........./...\..../..\..../...\..................
             /   +-\-+/    \+-/-+   \
                 | 1 |------| 2 |        Edge
                 +-|-+      +-|-+
                   |          |
          Figure 1: DC Exit Traffic Steering

   Router 1 and Router 2 represent the border leaf in a DC scenario, or
   the provider edge in a metro network.  Routers A, B and C represent
   the fabric interconnect in a data center, or the network core in a
   metro network.  Ideally, load would be shared between the outbound
   link at Router 1 and the outbound link at Router 2; equably if each
   link has the same capacity, or in proportion to the capacity of each
   link if they have different capacities.  This requires that router 1
   and router 2 know the load of each link so Routers A, B, and C, can
   dynamically steer traffic towards the correct exit point.  Normally
   the load of each of these links is only available to Routers 1 and 2
   locally; steering traffic to the correct exit requires manual
   monitoring and configuration on the part of the network operator.

   I2RS introduces the concept of a feedback loop; the I2RS client can
   dynamically learn the utilization of the links at Routers 1 and 2, as
   well as the state of the routing tables at Routers A, B, and C, the
   topology of the network, and other information.  Based on this
   information, the I2RS client can compute the changes necessary in the
   network to evenly balance the load between the two exit points, and
   inject the right information into the appropriate RIBs to make the
   necessary changes.

Internet-Draft              I2RS TS Use Case                   July 2014


   Achieving this requires the I2RS Client-Agent to have the following
   abilities:

   o  TS-REQ01: be able to collect the topology (especially the exit
      links) and the traffic load of each link;

   o  TS-REQ02: be able to read the local rib of each DC/Metro gateway
      and the policies deployed on each gateway;

   o  TS-REQ03: be able add or delete or modify the relevant rib items
      and polices to steer the traffic as expected.

4.  End-to-end Traffic Steering

4.1.  MPLS-TE

   In MPLS-TE, traffic is placed into a Label Switched Path (LSP),
   guding that traffic through a specific set of nodes and edges to
   traverse the network.  Each LSP represents a (potentially) different
   path through the network, allowing different streams to take a
   different path to reach the same destination device.  In placing
   LSPs, the network operator effectively steers traffic through the
   network.

   LSP computation and optimization can be performed by Path Computation
   Element (PCE) [RFC4655], which uses the Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440] as a southbound interface.
   Since the Path Computation Client (PCC) is embedded in the network
   devices, it can actively request path computation or just receive the
   path establishment direction from the stateful PCE
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and then establish the path.

   PCE and I2RS architectures contain similar functionalities.  In the
   end-to-end traffic steering scenario, these similar architectures
   provide complementary functions.  Since the PCE is mainly for path
   computation, traffic placement and steering are out of the scope of
   PCE, and I2RS can be used in these aspects.

   In order to support traffic placement and steering, the I2RS (I2RS
   client-agent exchange) is required to support:

   o  TS-REQ-04: The ability to collect the LSP information either from
      the PCE or directly from network devices;

   o  TS-REQ-05: The ability to collect the traffic matrix of the
      network, this is used to help the I2RS client to determine how to
      adjust the traffic placement;

Internet-Draft              I2RS TS Use Case                   July 2014


   o  TS-REQ-06: The ability to read the rib information and relevant
      policies of each network node;

   o  TS-REQ-03: The ability to add/delete/modify rib items and relevant
      policies hence to adjust traffic placement and steer as desired.

4.2.  Segment Routing

   Segment Routing (SR) supports end-to-end traffic steering by directly
   encoding the path and forwarding instruction information into the
   packet header, steering packets through an explicit route without
   per-flow states maintained in the transit nodes.  This provides a
   scalable way to perform Traffic Engineering (TE).

   In an SR capable network, there are two types of state.  One is the
   segment information that is supplied to the path computation entity
   for path computation.  It can be obtained either from the IGP based
   Segment advertisement [I-D.psenak-ospf-segment-routing-extensions]
   [I-D.previdi-isis-segment-routing-extensions], or through the unified
   BGP interface [draft-chen-idr-segment-distribution].  The other is
   the SR RIB information that is computed and installed by the path
   computation entity.

   The path computation entity can be either the control plane of the
   ingress node of a path or an external controller (e.g., PCE or SDN
   controller).  Since this is an I2RS use case, this document mainly
   talks about the latter (Controller based SR).  The controller can be
   an I2RS client or an application running on an I2RS client.  In
   either case, the I2RS interface should have two capabilities.  One is
   to collect the segment information, the other is able to read and
   write the SR RIB state.

   To support segment routing, the I2RS (client-agent exchange) is
   required to support the following abilities:

   o  TS-REQ-07:collect the topology and segment information needed to
      help the I2RS client to compute the end-to-end path;

   o  TS-REQ-05:collect the network traffic matrix needed to help the
      I2RS client to compute the optimized path;

   o  TS-REQ-08:read rib (especially the segment routing rib)
      information;

   o  TS-REQ-09: add/delete/modify the segment rib, this finally
      determines how the traffic is forwarded.
