1.  Introduction

   [RFC8360] describes an improved validation algorithm for signed
   objects published in the RPKI.  The improved validation algorithm
   would help in situations such as described in this [Report].
   However, operational experience has shown the described procedure for
   deploying updates to the validation algorithm, as described in
   [RFC6487] Section 9, is impractical.  This document deprecates the
   original [RFC6487] section 7 algorithm in favour of the [RFC8360]
   algorithm, and obsoletes [RFC8360] because a migration via those
   codepoints is infeasible.  This document also deprecates the
   procedure set out in [RFC6487] section 9 for future changes to the
   validation algorithm.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Deprecation of RFC 8360

   [RFC8360] defines several alternative OIDs for use in Resource
   Certificates [RFC6487]:

Internet-Draft          RPKI Validation Algorithm          February 2021


   o  id-cp-ipAddr-asNumber-v2 - Section 4.2.1 [RFC8360]

   o  id-pe-ipAddrBlocks-v2 - Sections 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2 [RFC8360]

   o  id-pe-autonomousSysIds-v2 - Sections 4.2.2.3 and 4.2.2.4 [RFC8360]

   The stated purpose of the above OIDs is rendered obsolete by the
   updated specifications contained in this document.

   Therefore:

   o  Issuing CAs MUST NOT include the above OIDs in newly issued
      Resource Certificates; and

   o  Relying parties encountering the above OIDs in Resource
      Certificates MUST proceed according to the updated procedures
      described below.

3.  Updates to RFC 6482

   This section updates Section 4 [RFC6482].  The following text:

      The IP address delegation extension [RFC3779] is present in the
      end-entity (EE) certificate (contained within the ROA), and each
      IP address prefix(es) in the ROA is contained within the set of IP
      addresses specified by the EE certificate's IP address delegation
      extension.

   Is replaced with:

      Either the IP Address Delegation extension described in [RFC3779]
      or the alternative IP Address Delegation extension described in
      [RFC8360] (but not both) is present in the end entity (EE)
      certificate (contained within the ROA), and each IP address
      prefix(es) in the ROA is contained within the VRS-IP set that is
      specified as an outcome of EE certificate validation described in
      Section 7.2 (as updated by this document) [RFC6487].

   Note that this ensures that ROAs can be valid only if all IP address
   prefixes in the ROA are encompassed by the VRS-IP of all certificates
   along the path to the trust anchor used to verify it.

   Operators MAY issue separate ROAs for each IP address prefix, so that
   the loss of one or more IP address prefixes from the VRS-IP of any
   certificate along the path to the trust anchor would not invalidate
   authorizations for other IP address prefixes.

4.  Updates to RFC 6487

   This section updates [RFC6487] to specify an improved behavior of a
   Relying Party implementation.

4.1.  Updates to Section 7.2

   The following section replaces Section 7.2 [RFC6487] (Resource
   Certification Path Validation) in its entirety.

   Validation of signed resource data using a target resource
   certificate consists of verying that the digital signature of the
   signed resource data is valid, using the public key of the target
   resource certificate, and also validating the resource certificate in
   the context of the RPKI, using the path validation process.

   There are two inputs to the validation algortihm:

   1.  A trust anchor

   2.  A certificate to be validated

   The algorithm is initialized with two new variables for use in the
   RPKI: Verified Resource Set-IP (VRS-IP) and Verified Resource Set-AS
   (VRS-AS).  These sets are used to track the set of INRs (IP address
   space and AS numbers) that are considered valid for each CA
   certificate.  The VRS-IP and VRS-AS sets are initially set to the IP
   Address Delegation and AS Identifier Delegation values, respectively,
   from the trust anchor used to perform validation.

   This path validation algorithm verifies, among other things, that a
   prospective certification path (a sequence of n certificates)
   satisfies the following conditions:

   a.  for all 'x' in {1, ..., n-1}, the subject of certificate 'x' is
       the issuer of certificate ('x' + 1);

   b.  certificate '1' is issued by a trust anchor;

   c.  certificate 'n' is the certificate to be validated; and

   d.  for all 'x' in {1, ..., n}, certificate 'x' is valid.

   Certificate validation requires verifying that all of the following
   conditions hold, in addition to the certification path validation
   criteria specified in Section 6 of [RFC5280].

   1.  The signature of certificate x (x>1) is verified using the public
       key of the issuer's certificate (x-1), using the signature
       algorithm specified for that public key (in certificate x-1).

   2.  The current time lies within the interval defined by the
       NotBefore and NotAfter values in the Validity field of
       certificate x.

   3.  The Version, Issuer, and Subject fields of certificate x satisfy
       the constraints established in Sections 4.1 to 4.7 of RFC 6487.

   4.  If certificate x uses the Certificate Policy defined in
       Section 4.8.9 of [RFC6487], then the certificate MUST contain all
       extensions defined in Section 4.8 of [RFC6487] that must be
       present.  The value(s) for each of these extensions MUST satisfy
       the constraints established for each extension in the respective
       sections.  Any extension not thus identified MUST NOT appear in
       certificate x.

   5.  If certificate x uses the Certificate Policy defined in
       Section 4.2.4.1 [RFC8360], then all extensions defined in
       Section 4.8 of [RFC6487], except Sections 4.8.9, 4.8.10, and
       4.8.11 MUST be present.  The certificate MUST contain an
       extension as defined in Sections 4.2.4.2 or 4.2.4.3 [RFC8360], or
       both.  The value(s) for each of these extensions MUST satisfy the
       constraints established for each extension in the respective
       sections.  Any extension not thus identified MUST NOT appear in
       certificate x.

   6.  Certificate x MUST NOT have been revoked, i.e., it MUST NOT
       appear on a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) issued by the CA
       represented by certificate x-1.

   7.  Compute the VRS-IP and VRS-AS set values as indicated below:

          If the IP Address Delegation extension is present in
          certificate x and x=1, set the VRS-IP to the resources found
          in this extension.

          If the IP Address Delegation extension is present in
          certificate x and x>1, set the VRS-IP to the intersection of
          the resources between this extension and the value of the VRS-
          IP computed for certificate x-1.

          If the IP Address Delegation extension is absent in
          certificate x, set the VRS-IP to NULL.

Internet-Draft          RPKI Validation Algorithm          February 2021


          If the IP Address Delegation extension is present in
          certificate x and x=1, set the VRS-IP to the resources found
          in this extension.

          If the AS Identifier Delegation extension is present in
          certificate x and x>1, set the VRS-AS to the intersection of
          the resources between this extension and the value of the VRS-
          AS computed for certificate x-1.

          If the AS Identifier Delegation extension is absent in
          certificate x, set the VRS-AS to NULL.

   8.  If there is any difference in resources in the VRS-IP and the IP
       Address Delegation extension on certificate x, or the VRS-AS and
       the AS Identifier Delegation extension on certificate x, then a
       warning listing the overclaiming resources for certificate x
       SHOULD be issued.

   These rules allow a CA certificate to contain resources that are not
   present in (all of) the certificates along the path from the trust
   anchor to the CA certificate.  If none of the resources in the CA
   certificate are present in all certificates along the path, no
   subordinate certificates could be valid.  However, the certificate is
   not immediately rejected as this may be a transient condition.  Not
   immediately rejecting the certificate does not result in a security
   problem because the associated VRS sets accurately reflect the
   resources validly associated with the certificate in question.

4.2.  Updates to Section 9

   Section 9 "Operational Considerations for Profile Agility" is
   removed.

5.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC7942.  The
   description of implementations in this section is intended to assist
   the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

Internet-Draft          RPKI Validation Algorithm          February 2021


   As of today these changesets have been produced for commonly used
   Relying Party implementations:

      NLnet Labs Routinator [routinator]

      OpenBSD rpki-client [rpkiclient]

      FORT Validator [fort]

   The 'public' OpenSSL X509v3_addr_validate_path() and
   X509v3_asid_validate_path() interfaces do not read the Policy OIDs.
   Also, these interfaces are not referenced outside OpenSSL itself:
   [codesearch] and [github].

   At the time of writing there are zero (0) certificates in the RPKI
   carrying the extensions and policy defined in [RFC8360].

6.  Security Considerations

   The authors believe that the revised validation algortihm introduces
   no new security vulnerabilities into the RPKI, because it cannot lead
   to any ROA and/or router certificates to be accepted if they contain
   resources that are not held by the issuer.
