1.  Introduction

   This document defines two YANG [RFC7950] modules, one module to
   configure a RESTCONF client and the other module to configure a
   RESTCONF server [RFC8040].  Both modules support the TLS [RFC8446]
   transport protocol with both standard RESTCONF and RESTCONF Call Home
   connections [RFC8071].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The RESTCONF Client Model

   The RESTCONF client model presented in this section supports both
   clients initiating connections to servers, as well as clients
   listening for connections from servers calling home.

   YANG feature statements are used to enable implementations to
   advertise which potentially uncommon parts of the model the RESTCONF
   client supports.

2.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] provides an overview of the data
   model for the "ietf-restconf-client" module.

   This tree diagram only shows the nodes defined in this module; it
   does show the nodes defined by "grouping" statements used by this
   module.

   Please see Appendix A.1 for a tree diagram that illustrates what the
   module looks like with all the "grouping" statements expanded.

2.2.  Example Usage

   The following example illustrates configuring a RESTCONF client to
   initiate connections, as well as listening for call-home connections.

   This example is consistent with the examples presented in Section 2
   of [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors] and Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

3.  The RESTCONF Server Model

   The RESTCONF server model presented in this section supports both
   listening for connections as well as initiating call-home
   connections.

   YANG feature statements are used to enable implementations to
   advertise which potentially uncommon parts of the model the RESTCONF
   server supports.

3.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] provides an overview of the data
   model for the "ietf-restconf-server" module.

   This tree diagram only shows the nodes defined in this module; it
   does show the nodes defined by "grouping" statements used by this
   module.

   Please see Appendix A.2 for a tree diagram that illustrates what the
   module looks like with all the "grouping" statements expanded.

3.2.  Example Usage

   The following example illustrates configuring a RESTCONF server to
   listen for RESTCONF client connections, as well as configuring call-
   home to one RESTCONF client.

   This example is consistent with the examples presented in Section 2
   of [I-D.ietf-netconf-trust-anchors] and Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-keystore].

                      The RESTCONF client SHOULD gracefully close
                      the underlying TLS connection upon completing
                      planned activities.  If the underlying TLS

                      to reestablish the connection.

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document uses groupings defined in
   [I-D.kwatsen-netconf-tcp-client-server],
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-tls-client-server], and
   [I-D.kwatsen-netconf-http-client-server].  Please see the Security
   Considerations section in those documents for concerns related those
   groupings.

   The YANG modules defined in this document are designed to be accessed
   via YANG based management protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Both of these protocols have mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS) with mutual
   authentication.

   The NETCONF access control model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of
   all available protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG modules that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  Some of these data nodes may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g.,
   edit-config) to these data nodes without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and
   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      None of the subtrees or data nodes in the modules defined in this
   document need to be protected from write operations.

   Some of the readable data nodes in the YANG modules may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      None of the subtrees or data nodes in the modules defined in this
   document need to be protected from read operations.

   Some of the RPC operations in the YANG modules may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus

   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      The modules defined in this document do not define any 'RPC' or
   'action' statements.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  The IETF XML Registry

   This document registers two URIs in the "ns" subregistry of the IETF
   XML Registry [RFC3688].  Following the format in [RFC3688], the
   following registrations are requested:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-client
      Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-server
      Registrant Contact: The NETCONF WG of the IETF.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

5.2.  The YANG Module Names Registry

   This document registers two YANG modules in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].  Following the format in [RFC6020], the the
   following registrations are requested:

      name:         ietf-restconf-client
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-client
      prefix:       ncc

B.2.  01 to 02

   o  Filled in previously missing 'ietf-restconf-client' module.

   o  Updated the ietf-restconf-server module to accommodate new
      grouping 'ietf-tls-server-grouping'.

B.3.  02 to 03

   o  Refined use of tls-client-grouping to add a must statement
      indicating that the TLS client must specify a client-certificate.

   o  Changed restconf-client??? to be a grouping (not a container).

B.4.  03 to 04

   o  Added RFC 8174 to Requirements Language Section.

   o  Replaced refine statement in ietf-restconf-client to add a
      mandatory true.

   o  Added refine statement in ietf-restconf-server to add a must
      statement.

   o  Now there are containers and groupings, for both the client and
      server models.

   o  Now tree diagrams reference ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams

   o  Updated examples to inline key and certificates (no longer a
      leafref to keystore)

B.5.  04 to 05

   o  Now tree diagrams reference ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams

   o  Updated examples to inline key and certificates (no longer a
      leafref to keystore)

B.6.  05 to 06

   o  Fixed change log missing section issue.

   o  Updated examples to match latest updates to the crypto-types,
      trust-anchors, and keystore drafts.

   o  Reduced line length of the YANG modules to fit within 69 columns.

Internet-Draft      RESTCONF Client and Server Models         April 2019


B.7.  06 to 07

   o  removed "idle-timeout" from "persistent" connection config.

   o  Added "random-selection" for reconnection-strategy's "starts-with"
      enum.

   o  Replaced "connection-type" choice default (persistent) with
      "mandatory true".

   o  Reduced the periodic-connection's "idle-timeout" from 5 to 2
      minutes.

   o  Replaced reconnect-timeout with period/anchor-time combo.

B.8.  07 to 08

   o  Modified examples to be compatible with new crypto-types algs

B.9.  08 to 09

   o  Corrected use of "mandatory true" for "address" leafs.

   o  Updated examples to reflect update to groupings defined in the
      keystore draft.

   o  Updated to use groupings defined in new TCP and HTTP drafts.

   o  Updated copyright date, boilerplate template, affiliation, and
      folding algorithm.

B.10.  09 to 10

   o  Reformatted YANG modules.

B.11.  10 to 11

   o  Adjusted for the top-level "demux container" added to groupings
      imported from other modules.

   o  Added "must" expressions to ensure that keepalives are not
      configured for "periodic" connections.

   o  Updated the boilerplate text in module-level "description"
      statement to match copyeditor convention.

   o  Moved "expanded" tree diagrams to the Appendix.

Internet-Draft      RESTCONF Client and Server Models         April 2019


B.12.  11 to 12

   o  Removed the 'must' statement limiting keepalives in periodic
      connections.

   o  Updated models and examples to reflect removal of the "demux"
      containers in the imported models.

   o  Updated the "periodic-connnection" description statements to
      better describe behavior when connections are not closed
      gracefully.

   o  Updated text to better reference where certain examples come from
      (e.g., which Section in which draft).

   o  In the server model, commented out the "must 'pinned-ca-certs or
      pinned-client-certs'" statement to reflect change made in the TLS
      draft whereby the trust anchors MAY be defined externally.

   o  Replaced the 'listen', 'initiate', and 'call-home' features with
      boolean expressions.
