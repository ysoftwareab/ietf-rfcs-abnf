         Hierarchical Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE).
                    draft-ietf-pce-stateful-hpce-00

Abstract

   A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information on
   the current network state, including: computed Label Switched Path
   (LSPs), reserved resources within the network, and pending path
   computation requests. This information may then be considered when
   computing new traffic engineered LSPs, and for associated
   and dependent LSPs, received from Path Computation Clients (PCCs).

   The Hierarchical Path Computation Element (H-PCE) architecture,
   provides an architecture to allow the optimum sequence of
   inter-connected domains to be selected, and network policy to be
   applied if applicable, via the use of a hierarchical relationship
   between PCEs.

   Combining the capabilities of Stateful PCE and the Hierarchical PCE
   would be advantageous. This document describes general considerations
   and use cases for the deployment of Stateful PCE(s) using the
   Hierarchical PCE architecture.

Internet-Draft               STATEFUL-HPCE                     June 2017


1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Clients' (PCCs)
   requests.

   A stateful PCE is capable of considering, for the purposes of
   path computation, not only the network state in terms of links and
   nodes (referred to as the Traffic Engineering Database or TED) but
   also the status of active services (previously computed paths,
   and currently reserved resources, stored in the Label Switched
   Paths Database (LSPDB).

   [RFC8051] describes general considerations for a stateful PCE
   deployment and examines its applicability and benefits, as well as
   its challenges and limitations through a number of use cases.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to
   provide stateful control.  A stateful PCE has access to not only the
   information carried by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP),
   but also the set of active paths and their reserved resources for its
   computations.  The additional state allows the PCE to compute
   constrained paths while considering individual LSPs and their
   interactions.  [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] describes the setup,
   maintenance and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE
   model.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] also describes the active stateful PCE.
   The active PCE functionality allows a PCE to reroute an existing
   LSP or make changes to the attributes of an existing LSP, or delegate
   control of specific LSPs to a new PCE.

   The ability to compute shortest constrained TE LSPs in Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across
   multiple domains has been identified as a key motivation for PCE
   development.  [RFC6805] describes a Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE)
   architecture which can be used for computing end-to-end paths for
   inter-domain MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) and GMPLS Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs).  Within the Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) architecture
   [RFC6805], the Parent PCE (P-PCE) is used to compute a multi-domain
   path based on the domain connectivity information.  A Child PCE
   (C-PCE) may be responsible for a single domain or multiple domains,
   it is used to compute the intra-domain path based on its domain
   topology information.

   This document presents general considerations for stateful PCE(s) in
   hierarchical PCE architecture.  In particular, the behavior changes

   and additions to the existing stateful PCE mechanisms (including PCE-
   initiated LSP setup and active PCE usage) in the context of networks
   using the H-PCE architecture. 

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The terminology is as per [RFC4655], [RFC5440], [RFC6805], and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

3.  Hierarchical Stateful PCE

   As described in [RFC6805], in the hierarchical PCE architecture, a
   P-PCE maintains a domain topology map that contains the child domains
   (seen as vertices in the topology) and their interconnections (links
   in the topology).  The P-PCE has no information about the content of
   the child domains.  Each child domain has at least one PCE capable of
   computing paths across the domain.  These PCEs are known as C-PCEs
   and have a direct relationship with the P-PCE.  The P-PCE builds the
   domain topology map either via direct configuration (allowing network
   policy to also be applied) or from learned information received from
   each C-PCE.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies new functions to support a
   stateful PCE.  It also specifies that a function can be initiated
   either from a PCC towards a PCE (C-E) or from a PCE towards a PCC
   (E-C).

   This document extends these functions to support H-PCE Architecture
   from a C-PCE towards a P-PCE (CE-PE) or from a P-PCE
   towards a C-PCE (PE-CE).  All PCE types herein (i.e., PE or CE)
   are assumed to be 'stateful PCE'.

   A number of interactions are expected in the Hierarchical Stateful
   PCE architecture, these include:

   LSP State Report (CE-PE):  a child stateful PCE sends an LSP state
      report to a Parent Stateful PCE whenever the state of a LSP
      changes.

   LSP State Synchronization (CE-PE):  after the session between the
      Child and Parent stateful PCEs is initialized, the P-PCE must
      learn the state of C-PCE's TE LSPs.

Internet-Draft               STATEFUL-HPCE                     June 2017


   LSP Control Delegation (CE-PE,PE-CE):  a C-PCE grants to the
      P-PCE the right to update LSP attributes on one or more LSPs;
      the C-PCE may withdraw the delegation or the P-PCE may
      give up the delegation at any time.

   LSP Update Request (PE-CE):  a stateful P-PCE requests 
      modification of attributes on a C-PCE's TE LSP.

   PCE LSP Initiation Request (PE-CE):  a stateful P-PCE requests
      C-PCE to initiate a TE LSP.

   Note that this hierarchy is recursive and thus a LSR could delegate
   the control to a PCE, which may delegate to its parent, which may
   further delegate it to its parent (if it exist or needed). Similarly
   update operations could also be applied recursively.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-hierarchy-extensions] defines the H-PCE capability TLV
   that should be used in the OPEN message to advertise the H-PCE
   capability. [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] defines the stateful PCE
   capability TLV. The presence of both TLVs represent the support for
   stateful H-PCE operations as described in this document. 

   [I-D.litkowski-pce-state-sync] describes the procedures to allow a
   stateful communication between PCEs for various use-cases. The
   procedures and extensions as described in Section 3 of
   [I-D.litkowski-pce-state-sync] are also applicable to Child and
   Parent PCE communication. 

3.1.  Passive Operations

   Procedures as described in [RFC6805] are applied, where the ingress
   C-PCE sends a request to the P-PCE.  The P-PCE selects a set of
   candidate domain paths based on the domain topology and the state of
   the inter-domain links.  It then sends computation requests to the C-
   PCEs responsible for each of the domains on the candidate domain
   paths.  Each C-PCE computes a set of candidate path segments across
   its domain and sends the results to the P-PCE. The P-PCE uses this
   information to select path segments and concatenate them to derive
   the optimal end-to-end inter-domain path.  The end-to-end path is
   then sent to the C-PCE that received the initial path request, and
   this C-PCE passes the path on to the PCC that issued the original
   request.

   As per [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce], PCC sends an LSP State Report
   carried on a PCRpt message to the C-PCE, indicating the LSP's status.
    The C-PCE MAY further propagate the State Report to the P-PCE.  A
   local policy at C-PCE MAY dictate which LSPs to be reported to the P-
   PCE.  The PCRpt message is sent from C-PCE to P-PCE.

   State synchronization mechanism as described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-sync-optimizations] are applicable to PCEP
   session between C-PCE and P-PCE as well.

   Taking the sample hierarchical domain topology example from [RFC6805]

   Steps 1 to 11 are exactly as described in section 4.6.2 (Hierarchical
   PCE End-to-End Path Computation Procedure) of [RFC6805], the
   following additional steps are added for stateful PCE:

   (1)  The Ingress LSR initiates the setup of the LSP as per the path
        and reports to the PCE1 the LSP status ("GOING-UP").

Internet-Draft               STATEFUL-HPCE                     June 2017


   (2)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   (3)  The Ingress LSR notifies the LSP state to PCE1 when the state is
        "UP".

   (4)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

3.2.  Active Operations


   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] describes the case of active stateful
   PCE. The active PCE functionality uses two specific PCEP messages:

   o Update Request (PCUpd)
   o State Report (PCRpt)

   The first is sent by the PCE to a Path Computation Client (PCC) for
   modifying LSP attributes. The PCC sends back a PCRpt to acknowledge
   the requested operation or report any change in LSP's state. 

   As per [RFC8051], Delegation is an operation to
   grant a PCE, temporary rights to modify a subset of LSP parameters on
   one or more PCC's LSPs.  The C-PCE may further choose to delegate
   to P-PCE based on a local policy.  The PCRpt message with "D"
   (delegate) flag is sent from C-PCE to P-PCE.

   To update an LSP, a PCE send to the PCC, an LSP Update Request using
   a PCUpd message.  For LSP delegated to the P-PCE via the child
   PCE, the P-PCE can use the same PCUpd message to request change
   to the C-PCE (the Ingress domain PCE), the PCE further propagates
   the update request to the PCC.

   The P-PCE uses the same mechanism described in Section 3.1 to compute
   the end to end path using PCReq and PCRep messages.

   The following additional steps are also initially performed,
   for active operations, again using the reference architecture
   described in Figure 1 (Sample Hierarchical Domain Topology).

   (1)  The Ingress LSR delegates the LSP to the PCE1 via PCRpt message
        with D flag set.

   (2)  The PCE1 further delegates the LSP to the P-PCE (PCE5).

   Steps 4 to 10 of section 4.6.2 of [RFC6805] are executed to determine
   the end to end path.

   (3)  The P-PCE (PCE5) sends the update request to the C-PCE
        (PCE1) via PCUpd message.

   (4)  The PCE1 further updates the LSP to the Ingress LSR (PCC).

   (5)  The Ingress LSR initiates the setup of the LSP as per the path
        and reports to the PCE1 the LSP status ("GOING-UP").

   (6)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   (7)  The Ingress LSR notifies the LSP state to PCE1 when the state is
        "UP".

   (8)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

3.3.  PCE Initiation Operation

   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] describes the setup, maintenance and
   teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model, without
   the need for local configuration on the PCC, thus allowing for a
   dynamic network that is centrally controlled and deployed.  To
   instantiate or delete an LSP, the PCE sends the Path Computation LSP
   Initiate Request (PCInitiate) message to the PCC.  In case of inter-
   domain LSP in Hierarchical PCE architecture, the initiation
   operations can be carried out at the P-PCE.  In which case after
   P-PCE finishes the E2E path computation, it can send the
   PCInitiate message to the C-PCE (the Ingress domain PCE), the PCE
   further propagates the initiate request to the PCC.

   The following additional steps are also initially performed,
   for PCE initiated operations, again using the reference
   architecture described in Figure 1 (Sample Hierarchical Domain
   Topology):

   (1)  The P-PCE (PCE5) is requested to initiate a LSP.

   Steps 4 to 10 of section 4.6.2 of [RFC6805] are executed to determine
   the end to end path.

   (2)  The P-PCE (PCE5) sends the initiate request to the child
        PCE (PCE1) via PCInitiate message.

   (3)  The PCE1 further propagates the initiate message to the Ingress
        LSR (PCC).

   (4)  The Ingress LSR initiates the setup of the LSP as per the path

        and reports to the PCE1 the LSP status ("GOING-UP").

   (5)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   (6)  The Ingress LSR notifies the LSP state to PCE1 when the state is
        "UP".

   (7)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

3.3.1.  Per Domain Stitched LSP

   The hierarchical PCE architecture as per [RFC6805] is primarily used
   for E2E LSP.  With PCE-Initiated capability, another mode of
   operation is possible, where multiple intra-domain LSPs are initiated
   in each domain which are further stitched to form an E2E LSP.  The
   P-PCE sends PCInitiate message to each C-PCE separately to
   initiate individual LSP segments along the domain path.  These
   individual per domain LSP are stitched together by some mechanism,
   which is out of scope of this document. The P-PCE may also send
   the PCInitiate message to the ingress C-PCE to initiate the E2E 
   LSP separately.

   The following additional steps are also initially performed,
   for the Per Domain stiched LSP operation, again using the reference
   architecture described in Figure 1 (Sample Hierarchical Domain
   Topology):

   (1)  The P-PCE (PCE5) is requested to initiate a LSP.

   Steps 4 to 10 of section 4.6.2 of [RFC6805] are executed to determine
   the end to end path, which are broken into per-domain LSPs say -

   o  S-BN41

   o  BN41-BN33

   o  BN33-D

   It should be noted that the P-PCE MAY use other mechanisms to
   determine the suitable per-domain LSPs (apart from [RFC6805]).

   For LSP (BN33-D)

   (2)  The P-PCE (PCE5) sends the initiate request to the child
        PCE (PCE3) via PCInitiate message for LSP (BN33-D).

   (3)  The PCE3 further propagates the initiate message to BN33.

   (4)  BN33 initiates the setup of the LSP as per the path and reports
        to the PCE3 the LSP status ("GOING-UP").

   (5)  The PCE3 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   (6)  The node BN33 notifies the LSP state to PCE3 when the state is
        "UP".

   (7)  The PCE3 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   For LSP (BN41-BN33)

   (8)  The P-PCE (PCE5) sends the initiate request to the child PCE
        (PCE4) via PCInitiate message for LSP (BN41-BN33).

   (9)  The PCE4 further propagates the initiate message to BN41.

   (10) BN41 initiates the setup of the LSP as per the path and reports
        to the PCE4 the LSP status ("GOING-UP").

   (11) The PCE4 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   (l2) The node BN41 notifies the LSP state to PCE4 when the state is
        "UP".

   (13) The PCE4 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   For LSP (S-BN41)

   (14)  The P-PCE (PCE5) sends the initiate request to the child
        PCE (PCE1) via PCInitiate message for LSP (S-BN41).

   (15)  The PCE1 further propagates the initiate message to node S.

   (16)  S initiates the setup of the LSP as per the path and reports to
        the PCE1 the LSP status ("GOING-UP").

   (17)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   (18)  The node S notifies the LSP state to PCE1 when the state is
        "UP".

   (19)  The PCE1 further reports the status of the LSP to the P-PCE
        (PCE5).

   Additionally:

   (20) Once P-PCE receives report of each per-domain LSP, it
        should use some stitching mechanism, which is out of scope of
        this document. In this step, P-PCE (PCE5) could also initiate  
        an E2E LSP (S-D) by sending the PCInitiate message to Ingress 
        C-PCE (PCE1).


4.  Other Considerations

4.1.  Applicability to Inter-Layer

   [RFC5623] describes a framework for applying the PCE-based
   architecture to inter-layer (G)MPLS traffic engineering.  The H-PCE
   Stateful architecture with stateful P-PCE coordinating with the
   stateful C-PCEs of higher and lower layer is shown in the figure
   below.

   All procedures described in Section 3 are applicable to inter-layer
   path setup as well.

4.2.  Applicability to ACTN

   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-framework] describes framework for
   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN), where each Physical
   Network Controller (PNC) is equivalent to C-PCE and P-PCE is
   the Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC).  The Per domain stitched
   LSP as per the Hierarchical PCE architecture described in
   Section 3.3.1 and Section 4.1 is well suited for ACTN.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-applicability-actn] examines the applicability of PCE
   to the ACTN framework. To support the function of multi domain
   coordination via hierarchy, the stateful hierarchy of PCEs plays a
   crucial role.  

   In ACTN framework, Customer Network Controller (CNC) can request the
   MDSC to check if there is a possibility to meet Virtual Network (VN)
   requirements (before requesting for VN provision).  The H-PCE
   architecture as described in [RFC6805] can supports via the use of
   PCReq and PCRep messages between the P-PCE and C-PCEs.

5.  Scalability Considerations

   It should be noted that if all the C-PCEs would report all the LSPs
   in their domain, it could lead to scalability issues for the P-PCE.
   Thus it is recommended to only report the LSPs which are involved in
   H-PCE, i.e. the LSPs which are either delegated to the P-PCE or
   initiated by the P-PCE. Scalability considerations for PCEP as per
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] continue to apply for the PCEP session
   between child and parent PCE. 

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations listed in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-
   pce],[RFC6805] and [RFC5440] apply to this document as well. As per
   [RFC6805], it is expected that the parent PCE will require all child
   PCEs to use full security when communicating with the parent. 


   Any multi-domain operation necessarily involves the exchange of
   information across domain boundaries.  This is bound to represent a
   significant security and confidentiality risk especially when the
   child domains are controlled by different commercial concerns.  PCEP
   allows individual PCEs to maintain confidentiality of their domain
   path information using path-keys [RFC5520], and the hierarchical PCE
   architecture is specifically designed to enable as much isolation of
 


Dhody, et al.            Expires December 2017                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft               STATEFUL-HPCE                     June 2017


   domain topology and capabilities information as is possible. The LSP
   state in the PCRpt message SHOULD continue to use this. 

   The security consideration for PCE-Initiated LSP as per
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] is also applicable from P-PCE to C-
   PCE.

   Thus securing the PCEP session (between the P-PCE and the C-PCE)
   using mechanism like TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) [RFC5925] or
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [I-D.ietf-pce-pceps] is RECOMMENDED.

7.  Manageability Considerations

   All manageability requirements and considerations listed in
   [RFC5440], [RFC6805], [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce], and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] apply to Stateful H-PCE defined in
   this document.  In addition, requirements and considerations listed
   in this section apply.

7.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   Support of the hierarchical procedure will be controlled by the
   management organization responsible for each child PCE. The parent
   PCE must only accept path computation requests from authorized child
   PCEs.  If a parent PCE receives report from an unauthorized child
   PCE, the report should be dropped. All mechanism as described in [I-
   D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]
   continue to apply.

7.2.  Information and Data Models

   An implementation SHOULD allow the operator to view the stateful and
   H-PCE capabilities advertised by each peer. The PCEP YANG module [I-
   D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang] can be extended to include details stateful H-
   PCE.


7.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

7.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440] and [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

7.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new requirements
   on other protocols.

7.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in [RFC5440] and [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] also
   apply to PCEP extensions defined in this document.

   The stateful H-PCE technique brings the applicability of stateful PCE
   as described in [RFC8051], for the LSP traversing multiple domains.  

8.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.
