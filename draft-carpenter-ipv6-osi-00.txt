            Mechanisms for OSI NSAPs, CLNP and TP over IPv6



                                 Abstract

		      draft-carpenter-ipv6-osi-00.txt

   This document recommends that network implementors who have planned or
   deployed an OSI NSAP addressing plan, and who wish to deploy or transition
   to IPv6, should redesign a native IPv6 addressing plan to meet their
   needs.  However, it also defines a set of mechanisms for the support
   of OSI NSAP addressing, CLNP, and Transport Protocols over an IPv6
   network.  These mechanisms are the ones that MUST be used if such
   support is required.  This document also defines a mapping of IPv6
   addresses within the OSI address format, should this be required.

   DISCUSSION LIST: send mail to majordomo@sunroof.eng.sun.com with
   "subscribe nosi" as message body.

   OPEN ISSUES:

   1. Use of restricted or truncated NSAPAs in source routing header?

   2. Any advice for CLNP sites with more than one NSAP prefix in use?

   3. Do discovery and stateless auto-config work with restricted NSAPs?
   Do discovery and any kind of auto-config work with truncated NSAPs?

   4. Do we need the Total Length field in the NSAPA extension header?
   (If not make it a reserved field to preserve the alignment)

   5. Is the NSAP extension header included in the security payload?

   6. Re routing with truncated NSAP addresses (section 4, just below:
   the diagram) Should we expand the "any suitable way" clause in this
   paragraph? It seems to imply a high degree of correlation between the
   [presumedly existing] CLNP network topology and the IPV6 subnet
   structure. Or is this an unjustified assumption?

   7. Should CLNP encapsulation & TP over IPv6 be separate documents?

   8. Which IETF working groups should adopt the document(s) after
   Danvers?

1. General recommendation on NSAP addressing plans

   This recommendation is addressed to network implementors who have
   already planned or deployed an OSI NSAP addressing plan for the usage
   of OSI CLNP [IS8473] according to the OSI network layer addressing
   plan [IS8348]. It recommends how they should adapt their addressing
   plan for use with IPv6 [IPv6].

   The majority of known CLNP addressing plans use either the Digital
   Country Code (DCC) or the International Code Designator (ICD) formats
   defined in [IS8348]. A particular example of this is the US
   Government OSI Profile Version 2 (GOSIP) addressing plan [RFC1629].
   The basic NSAP addressing scheme and current implementations are
   summarised in Annex A.

   [IS8348] specifies a maximum NSAP address size of 20 bytes and some
   network implementors have designed address allocation schemes which
   make use of this 20 byte address space.

   Other NSAP addressing plans have been specified by the ITU-T for
   public data services, such as X.25 and ISDN, and these can also have
   addresses up to 20 bytes in length.

   The general recommendation is that implementors SHOULD design native
   IPv6 addressing plans according to [Rekhter], but doing so as a
   natural re-mapping of their CLNP addressing plans. While it is
   impossible to give a general recipe for this, CLNP addresses in DCC
   or ICD format can normally be split into two parts: the high order
   part relating to the network service provider and the low order part
   relating to the user network topology and host computers.

   For example, in some applications of US GOSIP the high order part is
   the AFI, ICD, DFI, AA and RD fields, together occupying 9 bytes. The
   low order part is the Area and ID fields, together occupying 8 bytes.
   (The selector byte and the two reserved bytes are not part of the
   addressing plan.) Thus, in such a case, the high-order part would be
   replaced by the provider part of an IPv6 provider-based addressing
   plan.  An 8-byte provider prefix is recommended for this case and
   [Rekhter] MUST be followed in planning such a replacement. The low
   order part would then be mapped directly in the low-order half of the
   IPv6 address space, and user site address plans are unchanged.  A 6-
   byte ID field, exactly as used in US GOSIP and other CLNP addressing
   plans, will be acceptable as the token for IPv6 autoconfiguration
   [addrconf].

   Analogous rules would be applied for other CLNP addressing plans
   similar to US GOSIP, which is considered only as a well known
   example.

2. Summary of defined mechanisms

   The remainder of this document defines six distinct mechanisms.  All
   of these are ELECTIVE mechanisms, i.e. they are not mandatory parts
   of an IPv6 implementation, but if such mechanisms are needed they
   MUST be implemented as defined in this document.

      1. Restricted NSAPA mapping into 16-byte IPv6 address
      2. Truncated NSAPA for routing, full NSAPA in IPv6 extension header
      3. Normal IPv6 address, full NSAPA in IPv6 extension header
      4. CLNP encapsulated in IPv6
      5. OSI Transport Protocol carried over IPv6
      6. IPv6 address carried as OSI address

   Note in addition that an Internet Standard STD-35 "ISO Transport
   Service on top of the TCP" exists already [RFC1006].  There is a also
   a Proposed Standard for "OSI Connectionless Transport Service over
   UDP" [RFC1240].

   To clarify the relationship between the first four mechanisms, note
   that:

    If the first byte of an IPv6 address is hexadecimal 0x02
    (binary 00000010), then the remaining 15 bytes SHALL contain
    a restricted NSAPA mapped as in Section 3 below.

    If the first byte of an IPv6 address is hexadecimal 0x03
    (binary 00000011), then the remaining 15 bytes SHALL contain
    a truncated NSAPA as described in Section 4 below. EITHER an
    extension header containing the complete NSAPA, as in Section 5
    below, OR an encapsulated CLNP packet, SHALL be present.

    With any other format of IPv6 address, an extension header
    containing a complete NSAPA, as defined in Section 5 below,
    MAY be present. Alternatively, an encapsulated CLNP packet
    MAY be present.

3. Restricted NSAPA in a 16-byte IPv6 address for ICD and DCC

   Some organizations may decide for various reasons not to follow the
   above general recommendation to redesign their addressing plan.  They
   may wish to use their existing OSI NSAP addressing plan unchanged for
   IPv6. It should be noted that such a decision has serious
   implications for routing, since it means that routing between such
   organizations and the rest of the Internet is unlikely to be
   optimised. An organization using both native IPv6 addresses and NSAP
   addresses for IPv6 would be likely to have inefficient internal
   routing.  Nevertheless, to cover this eventuality, the present
   document defines a way to map a subset of the NSAP address space into
   the IPv6 address space. The mapping is algorithmic and reversible
   within this subset of the NSAP address space.

   Certain other uses of this algorithmic mapping could be envisaged.
   It could be used as an intermediate addressing plan for a network
   making a transition from CLNP to IPv6. It could be used in a header
   translation scheme for dynamic translation between IPv6 and CLNP. It
   could be used to allow CLNP and IPv6 traffic to share the same
   routing architecture within an organization (Ships in the Day).

   The AFcode nibble is encoded as follows

       0000-1001      AFI value is 47 (ICD)
       (0-9 decimal)  AFcode is first BCD digit of the ICD
                      IDI is last three BCD digits of the ICD

       1010           AFI value is 39 (DCC)
       (hex. A)       IDI is the three BCD digits of the DCC

       1011-1111      Reserved, not to be used.
       (hex. B-F)

   The NSEL octet is not included. It is of no use for TCP and UDP
   traffic.  In any case where it is needed, the mechanism described in
   the next section should be used.

   The longest CLNP routing prefixes known to be in active use today are
   5 octets (subdivided into AA and RD fields in US GOSIP version 2).
   Thus the semantics of existing 20-octet NSAPAs can be fully mapped.
   DECnet/OSI (Registered Trade Mark) address semantics are also fully
   mapped.

   A network using such addresses could route using Internet routing
   protocols (or suitably adapted implementations of ES-IS [3], IS-IS
   [4] and IDRP [5]).  It is expected that hosts using such addresses
   could be configured using IPv6 stateful auto-configuration
   [addrconf].

4. Truncated NSAPA used as an IPv6 address

   An NSAP address contains routing information (e.g. Routing Domain and
   area/subnet identifiers) in the form of the Area Address (as defined
   in [IS10589]). The format and length of this routing information are
   typically compatible with a 16 byte IPV6 address, and may be
   represented as such using the following format:

          0                   1                   2                   3
          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    0-3  |0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1|  High order octets of full NSAP address       |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    4-7  |                NSAP address continued                         |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    8-11 |                NSAP address continued and truncated           |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    12-15|  zero pads if necessary       |    pack ID if applicable      |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   In this case, the high order octets which make up the Area Address
   portion of the NSAP address are used in any suitable way for routing
   to an IPv6 node which can interpret a full NSAP address. Depending
   upon the length of the NSAP, it may be possible to use the same
   system ID value in the IPv6 address as in the NSAP. If appropriate,
   the address can be interpreted as an IPv6 pack address, with the pack
   ID in the two low order bytes of the address.

   A pack ID may be used to identify either a host or router, or
   potentially even an OSI Endsystem or Intermediate System.  For
   example, a pack ID might be configured to identify the endpoints of a
   CLNP tunnel, or it might identify a particular OSI capable system in
   a particular subnet.  If such an address is used as either the source
   or destination IPv6 address, an NSAPA extension header or CLNP packet
   MUST be present.  It is the responsibility of the system identified
   by the pack ID to take the appropriate action for each IPV6 packet
   received (e.g. forward, decapsulate, discard) and, if necessary,
   return to the originating host an appropriate ICMP error message.

   If a pack ID is used to identify a router in a particular subnet, and
   the NSAPA extension header follows the IPV6 routing header, then it
   is the responsibility of that router to forward the complete IPV6
   packet to the appropriate host based upon the Destination NSAP field
   in the NSAPA header.  This forwarding process may be based upon
   static routing information (i.e. a manual mapping of NSAPs to IPV6
   unicast addresses), or it may be gathered in an automated fashion
   analogous to the ES-IS mechanism, perhaps using extensions to the
   Neighbor Discovery protocol.  The details of such a mechanism are
   beyond the scope of this document.

   This document does not restrict the formats of NSAP address that may
   be used in truncated NSAPAs, but it is apparent that binary ICD or
   DCC formats will be much easier to accomodate in an IPv6 routing
   infrastructure than the other formats defined in [IS8348].

5. Carriage of full NSAPAs in IPv6 extension headers

   The codings described in the previous sections are inadequate if the
   ICD or DCC binary format in use is too large to fit into 16 bytes, or
   if any other format defined in [IS8348] must be carried. In this
   case, an IPv6 extension header of type NSAPA is used. Protocol code
   57 has been assigned by IANA for this and will appear in the next
   edition of [assigned]. This header follows the IPv6 routing header if
   present, and its format is:

          0                   1                   2                   3

          |                                                               |

          |                                                               |
          +                       Destination NSAP                        +
          |                                                               |
          +                                                               +
          |                                                               |
          +                                                               +
          |                                                               |

          +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The length fields are each one octet long and are expressed in
   octets.  The boundary between the source NSAP and the destination
   NSAP length is simply aligned on an octet boundary. With standard 20
   octet NSAPs the total header length is 48 bytes.

   The NSAP encodings follow [IS8348] exactly. If only one of the end
   systems uses NSAP addresses, the NSAP Length field of the other SHALL
   be set to zero in the NSAP extension header.

   This extension header is used in two cases. Firstly, an IPv6 source
   node using normal IPv6 addresses (unicast address or pack address)
   MAY supply an NSAP extension header for interpretation by the IPv6
   destination node. Secondly, an IPv6 node MAY use a truncated NSAP
   address in place of a normal IPv6 address.

6. CLNP encapsulated in IPv6

   If it is required to tunnel CLNP [IS8473] through an IPv6 network,
   then the transport header SHALL be a CLNP PDU, and the final IPv6
   Next Header field SHALL have the value 80 decimal (as defined for
   ISO-IP in [assigned]).

   Mechanisms for the creation of CLNP tunnels and their management are
   outside the scope of this document. As for the cases described in the
   previous section, the IPv6 end nodes might be conveniently reached by
   pack addresses.

   Note that the tunnelling of CLNP over the Internet is discussed in
   detail in [RFC1070], but that document has no standards status and
   makes different assumptions about address mapping.  In contrast to
   [RFC1070], CLNP tunnels through an IPv6 network are simply a virtual
   point-to-point encapsulation technology, using statically configured
   tunnel endpoints.  There is no support for simulating a multipoint
   subnetwork, nor for dynamic mapping between NSAP addresses and IP
   addresses.  Instead, IP addresses are simply viewed as Subnetwork
   Point of Attachment (SNPA) addresses that must be statically
   configured to create the tunnel.

   Once a tunnel is established, data is transmitted using CLNP
   [IS8473].  The ES-IS [3], IS-IS [4], and IDRP [5] protocols may be
   used to dynamically establish neighbor adjacencies and routing.  Any
   NSAP addresses may be assigned to the systems at either end of the
   tunnel.  There is no need to constrain the NSAP address format as
   documented in [RFC1070], since there is no need to perform dynamic
   address mapping. The "EON" header of [RFC1070] is not present.

   No attempt is required to implement feedback of error indications
   from ICMP in the IP subnetwork into CLNP error PDUs.  The tunnel is
   ignorant of problems in the IP subnetwork, and depends upon
   mechanisms in the OSI routing protocols to detect connectivity
   failures.

7. ISO Transport Protocols over IPv6

   If it is required to carry ISO Transport Protocols [ISO8072, ISO8073]
   over an IPv6 network, then the IPv6 transport header SHALL be a TP
   PDU, and the final IPv6 Next Header field SHALL have the value 29
   decimal (as defined for ISO-TP in [assigned]).

   7.1 Protocol Classes

   The ISO connection-oriented transport protocol [ISO8073] supports
   five different classes of service. Only one such class, class 4
   (TP4), is suitable for use on a connectionless network service such
   as provided by IPv6. Transport classes 0 through 3 should not carried
   over an IPv6 network in this manner.

   Note that the connectionless transport protocol [ISO8072] has no such
   restriction. Its PDUs should be carried exactly as described above.
   There is no conflict inherent in using the same IPv6 Next Header
   value for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.  ISO
   transport implementations can distinguish the two protocols by their
   different PDU types.

   7.2 Maximum TPDU Size

   When negotiating a maximum TPDU size, TP4 implementations may
   consider the services available from the network layer. Unlike IPv4
   or CLNP, IPv6 only permits fragmentation by the originating system.
   TP4 may use its knowledge of the capabilities of the local system to
   maximize the efficiency of data transfer.

   7.2.1 Path MTU Discovery and Fragmentation

   If the TP4 implementation can accept Path MTU Discovery [RFC1191]
   information, and if the TP4 implementation can efficiently invoke the
   IPv6 fragmentation function, then the TP4 may propose the largest
   TPDU size and/or preferred maximum TPDU size that the implementation
   can support.

   If, during the life of the connection, IPv6 reports PMTU information
   to the TP4 implementation, TP4 should adjust its local TPDU size
   accordingly. Note that the original TPDU (the one which solicited the
   PMTU) cannot be repacketized; TP4 must instead rely on IPv6
   fragmentation for that PDU's retransmission.

   7.2.2 No Path MTU Discovery or Fragmentation

   If the TP4 implementation cannot accept Path MTU Discovery
   information from IPv6, or if it cannot efficiently invoke the IPv6
   fragmentation function, then TP4 may propose a TPDU size of
   {512|1024} octets and a preferred maximum TPDU size of {512|1408}
   octets. These sizes will ensure that TPDUs are no larger than the
   IPv6 minimum MTU of {576|1500} bytes [IPv6].

   7.3 PDU Lifetime

   Unlike IPv4 and CLNP, IPv6 nodes are not required to enforce PDU
   lifetimes.  Any transport protocol that relies on the network
   protocol to limit packet lifetime ought to be upgraded to provide its
   own mechanisms for detecting and discarding obsolete packets.

   7.4 Related work

   The carriage of OSI Connectionless Transport Services over UDP is
   described in [RFC1240], which is currently a Proposed Standard.  The
   present proposal is independent of that one.

8. IPv6 addresses inside an NSAPA

   If it is required, for whatever reason, to embed an IPv6 address
   inside a 20-octet NSAP address, then the following format MUST be
   used.

   A specific possible use of this embedding is to express an IP address
   within the ATM Forum address format [UNI].  Another  possible use
   would be to allow CLNP packets that encapsulate IPv6 packets to be
   routed in a CLNP network using the IPv6 address architecture. Several
   leading bytes of the IPv6 address could be used as a CLNP routing
   prefix.

   The first three octets are an IDP meaning "this NSAPA embeds a 16
   byte IPv6 address" and the last octet is a dummy selector.  To
   maintain compatibility with both NSAP format and IPv6 addressing,
   this octet must be present but unused.

   Recursive address embedding is not allowed. The embedded IPv6 address
   MUST NOT have the prefixes 0x02 or 0x03, and an NSAP with the Isoc
   ICD code MUST NOT be embedded in an IPv6 packet.

9. Security condiderations

   Security issues are not specifically addressed in this document, but
   it is compatible with the IPv6 security mechanisms [security].  Note,
   however, that when CLNP is tunnelled through IPv6 the IPv6 security
   mechanisms can at best protect the tunnel, but not the end-to-end
   CLNP service.

Annex A: Summary of NSAP Allocations

            -----IDP------
            -----------------------------------------------------
            | AFI  | IDI  |     DOMAIN SPECIFIC PART            |
            -----------------------------------------------------
            --------------------20 bytes max---------------------

   The Initial Domain Part (IDP) is split into Authority and Format
   Identifier (AFI) followed by the Initial Domain Identifier (IDI).
   This combination is followed by the Domain Specific Part and
   allocation within that part is domain specific.

   The following is a summary of current allocations:

   ISO DCC Scheme

   AFI = decimal 38 or binary 39 = ISO Data Country Code Scheme.  IDI =
   3 decimal or binary digits specifying the country.  ISO allocate the
   country codes.  The DSP is administered by the standards authority
   for each country.  In the UK, the British Standards Institution have
   delegated administration to the Federation of Electronics Industries
   - FEI

   The UK DSP is split into a single digit UK Format Indicator (UKFI)
   which indicates large, medium or small organisation rather like IP
   addressing and a UK Domain Identifier (UKDI).  Using binary code
   decimal examples only (there are binary equivalents):

   UKFI = 0 is reserved UKFI = 1, UKDI = nnn, UK Domain Specific Part =
   31 digits.  UKFI = 2, UKDI = nnnnn, UKDSP = 29 digits max.  UKFI = 3,
   UKDI = nnnnnnnn, UKDSP = 26 digits max.

   UKFI = 4 to 9 reserved

   The UK Government have been allocated a UKDI in the UKFI = 1 (large
   organisation) format and have specified the breakdown of the
   Government Domain Specific Part with sub domain addresses followed by
   a station ID (which could be a MAC address) and a selector (which
   could be a TSAP selection).

   ITU-T X.121

   AFI = decimal 36 or 52, binary 37 or 53 indicates that the IDI is a
   14 digit max X.121 International Numbering Plan address (prefix, 3
   digit Data Country Code, dial up data network number).  The full
   X.121 address indicates who controls the formatting of the DSP.

   ITU-T F.69

   AFI = 40,54 or binary 41,55 indicates that the IDI is a telex number
   up to 8 digits long.

   ITU-T E.163

   AFI = 42,56 or binary 43,57 indicates that the IDI is a normal
   telephone number up to 12 digits long.

   ITU-T E.164

   AFI = 44,58 or binary 45,59 indicates that the IDI is an ISDN number
   up to 15 digits long.

   ISO 6523-ICD

   AFI = 46 or binary 47 indicates that the IDI is an International Code
   Designator allocated according to ISO 6523.  You have to be a global
   organisation to get one of these.  The Organisation to which the ISO
   6523 designator is issued specifies the DSP allocation.
