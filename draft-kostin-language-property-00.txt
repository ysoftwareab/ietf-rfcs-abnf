Status of this Memo

         This document is an Internet-Draft and is subject to
         all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026 (in spite of
         this section is so large that I, probably, even have
         not yet entirely read it).

     Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
     Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that
     other groups may also distribute working documents as
     Internet-Drafts.

     Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
     months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other

Abstract

     (Standard Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is used hereinafter.)
     This document describes an enhancing of the way of presenting 
characters in HTML by symbolic names "&<character's ASCII symbolic 
name>;", by adding to the symbolic name an optional language property in 
the following manner "&<character's ASCII symbolic name>[-<character's 
ASCII language property>];".

RFC NNNN     Language property for symbolic name notation     March 2002



________________________________________________________________________
Introduction

     Dear Sirs,

     It seems likely that method of encoding characters in operating 
systems becomes more and more similar to symbolic name method 
implemented in HTML by notation &<symbolic name>; (see ref. [1] below) 
(notation, probably, originated from SGML (for SGML, see ref. [3] 
below)). Especially this process becomes apparent in UTF-8 sequences. At 
the days of writing this document the symbolic name is not yet become a 
method of operating systems. Probably, the way for implementing this 
method inside operating systems lies over prior trial in HTML. This 
document describes (1st step on the way) an enhancing symbolic name 
notation by adding to it an optional language property which must show 
which language an encoded character belongs to.

CHAPTER 1 - Notational conventions.

(001.001.001.0001 - Chapter 1, division 1, section 1, paragraph 1)

     A standard Backus-Naur Form (BNF) notation is used in this 
document.
<...> - means that enclosed expression is a definition of some element.
[...] - means that enclosed expression is an optional element.
{...} - means that enclosed expression is repeated 0 (zero) or more
           times.
<ABL> - defines left angle bracket i. e. "<".
<ABL> - defines right angle bracket i. e. ">".
<SBL> - defines left square bracket i. e. "[".
<SBR> - defines right square bracket i. e. "]".
<braceL> - defines left brace i. e. "{".
<braceR> - defines right brace i. e. "}".

CHAPTER 2 - Language property for symbolic name notation.

(002.001.001.0001 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 1)

     This document introduces an optional language property for symbolic 
names, the names by which characters are encoded in HTML (see ref. [1] 
below). The language property is a short name of a language which 
specifies what a language the character encoded by a symbolic name 
belongs to. The language property is composed of ASCII characters only 
(for ASCII, see ref. [4] below), added after specified symbolic name 
separated from the symbolic name (or another character property) by the 
hyphen (minus) "-" character.

(002.001.001.0002 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 2)

     BNF sample: &<symbolic name>[-<language property>]{-<another 
property>};

     The language property is, as mentioned above (paragraph 1, 
abstract, introduction), optional parameter.

(002.001.001.0003 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 3)

     Exempli gratia:
"&e-lat;&x-lat; &g-lat;&r-lat;&a-lat;&t-lat;&i-lat;&a-lat;" - defines
     Latin expression which, probably, means "for example";
"&p-serb;&a-serb;&r-serb;&k-serb;" - defines Serbo-Croatian word
     which means "a park".

(002.001.001.0004 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 4)

     It is supposed that folks choose short words to name languages and 
that the list of chosen languages names is permanently opened for 
reading, copying, distributing, and adding a new language name. (The 
last is rather with few restrictions.) Please, take into consideration 
that this document doesn't contain any list of languages names.

(002.001.001.0005 - Chapter 2, division 1, section 1, paragraph 5)

     An example of the languages names list.
bopo         - Bopomofo
en           - English
en_US        - English, American
kling        - Klingon language
lat          - Latin
slav_old     - Old Slavonic/Slavic
rus          - Russian
serb         - Serbo-Croatian
