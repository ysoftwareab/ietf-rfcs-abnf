            Abstract 
             
            This document defines a reference architecture for a VPLS system. It 
            describes possible VPLS architectures based on this reference 
            architecture and the merits of each. Each VPLS architecture is 
            described in terms of its logical components and their relationship to 
            each other, as well as the mapping of these logical components to 
            physical network elements. By understanding these logical components, 
            which are fundamental building blocks for any VPLS system, one can 
            easily compare different VPLS architectures and understand the pros and 
            cons of each. A VPLS system may support one or more of these 
            architectures simultaneously. 
             
             
                                                                          [Page 1]

            Having described each VPLS architecture, we explore the different 
            logical components of the reference architecture, and describe how they 
            relate to a Service Provider backbone (whether MPLS enabled or not). 
            Finally, we examine the operation of each VPLS architecture.

          2. Introduction 
           
            The primary motivation behind Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLS) is to 
            provide connectivity between geographically dispersed customer sites 
            across MAN/WAN network(s), as if they were connected through a Local 
            Area Network. Furthermore, the intended application for the end-user 
            can be divided into the following two categories:  
             
               . Connectivity between site routers û LAN routing application 
               . Connectivity between site Ethernet switches û LAN switching 
                 application 
             
            The LAN routing application is intended for the interconnection of 
            routers via a metro or wide area network, and for providing a broadcast 
            domain among these routers. Traditionally, the interconnection of VPN 
            sites over a MAN/WAN has required a mesh of overlay virtual circuits 
            between routers. Adding a new router to the interconnection mesh 
            potentially requires significant reconfiguration. The VPLS service is 
            intended to mitigate this interconnection problem by leveraging native 
            broadcast capabilities for router discovery, along with a simple point-
            to-cloud service model. This service model simplifies the task of 
            configuration and provisioning for the end customer routers by 
            providing a virtual LAN/bridge system. Therefore, to the routers it 
            looks as if they are connected via a local LAN switch even though they 
            are located in different sites.  
             
            The LAN switching application as its name implies provides a virtual 
            LAN switching service to its end users and it is used for 
            interconnecting customer switches across a MAN/WAN network. Therefore, 
            if several sites within a VPN subscribe to this service, it looks as if 
            these sites are co-located within a campus, and are connected via a 
            local Ethernet switch providing bridging services for them. This 
            service is not anticipated to be widely deployed in large-scale 
            networks because of limited scalability and lower network efficiency. 
            However, for small/medium business customers, this service can be very 
            viable to extend the bridging domain between VPN sites across a MAN/WAN 
            network. By extending the bridging domain, the customer only needs to 
            use low-cost Ethernet switches as CPEs. 
             
            The underlying VPLS service for supporting these two types of 
            applications is fundamentally the same. However, each application has 
            different requirements in terms of control frame processing, MAC 
            address usage, BPDUs handling, and so on.

            The following figure shows a VPLS system with two VPLS instances û one 
            for each customer, referred to as ôVPLS Aö and ôVPLS Bö. This figure 
            shows that each customer CPE device (whether router or switch) connects 
            to a PE device within the Service Provider POP. It should be noted that 
            when the term ôa VPLSö is used by itself, it refers to a VPLS instance 
            and not a VPLS system.

            One of the main scenarios for the VPLS service is the delivery of an 
            Ethernet service to multiple customers co-located in one or more MxUs 
            over the Metro Area. MxUs can be apartments or multi-dwelling units 
            (MDUs), office buildings or multi-tenant units (MTUs), and hotels or 
            multi-hospitality units (MHUs). In such cases, it would be much more 
            cost effective to place an aggregation device at the co-location site, 
            rather than connecting each CPE directly to a PE within the Service 
            Provider POP. This device would be used to aggregate all customersÆ 
            traffic and carry it via an uplink to the Service ProviderÆs POP as 
            opposed to having a separate uplink for each customer. Because of a 
            large number of co-location sites and thus large number of aggregation 
            devices in a Metro area, it is important for the aggregation device to 
            be truly low cost. In such cases, the VPLS functionality is distributed 
            between the aggregation device in the co-location site and the PE 
            sitting in the Service Provider POP. Apart from the obvious cost 
            reductions, a VPLS system based on a distributed-PE model is also able 
            to provide access bandwidth efficiency and system scalability. These 
            additional benefits will be described in more detail in section 2.3.

            The following figure extends the VPLS system architecture to include 
            distributed-PE functionality. As can be seen in the figure, the VPLS 
            system can have a mix of distributed and non-distributed (single) PEs. 
            In the case of a non-distributed PE, we refer to it simply as PE and it 
            is typically located in the Service ProviderÆs central office or POP. 
            In the case of a distributed PE, we refer to the PE located at the 
            customer site as PE-CLE and the PE located in the Service ProviderÆs 
            POP as PE-POP. The Service ProviderÆs Backbone network connecting 
            PEs/PE-POPs can be based on either MPLS or IP. 
             
            As shown in the figure, there are several different ways for CEs and 
            PE-CLEs to connect to the Service ProviderÆs network. CEs and PE-CLEs 
            can be either connected directly to PE-POPs via a given transport 
            mechanism such as SONET, Fiber, CWDM/DWDM, and so on, or they can be 
            connected via an Ethernet access network. In the later case, care must 
            be taken to avoid loops in the access network using standard mechanisms 
            such as STP. Furthermore, there may be cases (although not typical) 
            where several customer sites are connected to the same PE-CLE. This may 
            imply certain restrictions on the customerÆs network based on the 
            capability of the PE-CLE as will be elaborated upon in section 10.2.

            The reference architecture described in this section is based on the 
            model defined in [L2ARCH] with several extensions. The model defined in 
            [L2ARCH] is primarily intended for non-VPLS systems with non-
            distributed PEs (e.g., a single PE is used to connect a CE device to 
            the Service ProviderÆs network).  
             
            A non-VPLS L2VPN can be described in terms of its components as defined 
            in [L2ARCH]. These components are: 
             
               . Attachment VCs 
               . Emulated VCs 
               . Emulated Tunnels 
               . Auto Discovery  
               . Auto Configuration

            We introduce three additional components as follows for a VPLS system 
            that will be described in subsequent sections of this draft. The first 
            component is mandatory for a VPLS system (along with the first three 
            non-VPLS components described above) and the other two components are 
            needed for a distributed-PE model (and more specifically for a 
            particular distributed-PE model). 
             
               . Virtual Switch Instances (VSI) 
               . Attachment Tunnels 
               . Extension VCs 
             
            The only components that are dependent on network type (MPLS vs. IP) 
            are Emulated VCs and Emulated Tunnels. In [L2ARCH] an Attachment VC is 
            defined as the virtual circuit between a CE and its associated PE, and 
            an Emulated VC is defined as the virtual circuit between two PEs. 
            Therefore, an end-to-end virtual circuit between two CEs can be defined 
            as an ordered triple <Attachment VC, Emulated VC, Attachment VC>. The 
            mapping between Attachment VC and its corresponding Emulated VC is one-
            to-one and is performed on each side by its associated PE. Furthermore, 
            the mapping between the Attachment VC and its corresponding Emulated VC 
            is fixed and is established at the time of end-to-end circuit 
            establishment. The Attachment and Emulated VCs are always terminated in 
            the PEs and thus L2VPN processing is only limited to PE nodes and 
            transparent to P nodes. 
             
            In a VPLS system, the Attachment VCs can be considered as connected to 
            a Virtual Switch (referred to as a Virtual Switch Instance û VSI) 
            corresponding to that VPLS instance at each PE. Furthermore, the 
            Emulated circuits can be considered as the virtual circuits connecting 
            these Virtual Switches located at each PE.  
             
            A VPLS for a given customer can be defined as a set of Virtual Switches 
            (one in each PE that is part of the VPLS) connected to each other via 
            Emulated VCs and to CEs via Attachment VCs. This means that for a VPLS 
            system, the relationship between the Attachment and Emulated VCs is no 
            longer fixed. The dynamic mapping of these entities (which is sometimes 
            one-to-one for unicast and sometimes one-to-many for multicast or 
            broadcast) is provided by each Virtual Switch through the use of the 
            destination MAC address, and is performed on a frame-by-frame basis. 
             
            Given the above description of a VPLS system, a customer VPLS instance 
            can be defined in terms of its Attachment VCs, its Emulated VCs, and 
            its set of Virtual Switches as follows: < Ingress Attachment VCs, 
            Ingress VSIs, Emulated VCs, Egress VSIs, Egress Attachment VCs>. The 
            following figure depicts the Attachment and the Emulated VCs and their

            What differentiates the VSI from a typical Ethernet switch is its 
            ability to do MAC address learning, flooding, forwarding, and so on, 
            based on virtual circuits (e.g., based on Emulated VCs) per broadcast 
            domain. For example, if a physical port of a PE carries several 
            Emulated VCs, then the VSI can replicate packets (for flooding or 
            broadcasting) across these Emulated VCs over the same physical port. 
            This is in contrast to a typical switch that may only perform packet 
            replication across physical ports for a given broadcast domain.  
             
            A VPLS-capable PE shall have one VSI per VPLS instance and it can 
            either be transparent to a customerÆs VLANs or it can recognize the 
            customerÆs VLANs. If the PE is transparent to the customer VLANs, then 
            the associated VSI will handle customerÆs VLANs transparently; however, 
            if the PE needs to recognize customersÆ VLANs and to provide isolation 
            among them, then separate VSIs for each customer VLAN should be 
            maintained. Each VSI corresponds to a separate broadcast domain and may 
           
          Sajassi, et al           Expires September 2002                 [Page 8] 
           
             
            Internet Draft   draft-sajassi-vpls-architectures-00.txt  February 2002 
             
            be shared between customer sites for the creation of Extranet or 
            Internet connectivity. The requirement for maintaining a separate 
            broadcast domain per VPLS instance is identified in [VPLS-REQ].  
             
            Since customersÆ VLANs can be overlapping, the PE should have the 
            capability of associating customers VLANs with a unique identifier for 
            identification of the VSIs. Therefore, the ability to a) map customers 
            VLANs into unique identifiers (for VLAN-aware PE) and b) to perform VSI 
            functionality with Emulated VCs, constitutes major data-plane 
            requirements for a VPLS capable PE.   
             
            For a PE that needs to recognize customersÆ VLANs and to maintain 
            isolation among them, if each customer assigns their VLANs 
            independently, then overlapping VLANs can occur within that PE. 
            Therefore, the PE is required to provide additional capability so as to 
            map customersÆ VLANs into unique VSI identifiers. However, if the 
            Service Provider assigns the VLANs to its customers, then assignment 
            can be done such that customersÆ VLANs are unique within a PE and thus 
            the VLAN-id itself can be used as the VSI identifier thus simplifying 
            the requirement for the PE or the PE-CLE (in the case of the 
            distributed-PE model). However, this simplification at the PE comes at 
            the expense of the customer loosing the flexibility of assigning his or 
            her own VLANs (which maybe acceptable for certain deployment models).  
             
            The next few sections describe different VPLS architectures. A VPLS 
            system may support one or more of these architectures simultaneously. 
             
             
          2.2. Single-PE Model  
             
            In the single-PE model, each PE is capable of performing the full set 
            of VPLS functions and it can be either located in a customer premise or 
            at the Service Provider POP. If the PE is located in the customer 
            premise, then the link between the CE and the PE is local and many CEs 
            can be aggregated via the upstream Service Provider link. However, it 
            may cost too much to place a PE in the customer premise or the number 
            of customer located PEs may present some system scalability issues. If 
            the PE is located in the Service Provider POP, then one MAN link is 
            required per customer which may in turn result in an increase cost of 
            facilities and thus an increase in operational costs. Section 2.3 shows 
            how the use of a distributed-PE can address these issues effectively 
            when a single-PE environment is not desirable. 
             
            In a single-PE model, all VPLS functionality is performed within a 
            single PE. In terms of the data-plane operation, these functions 
            constitute:

               . Attachment VCs termination 
               . Emulated VCs termination 
               . Tunneling of Emulated VCs  
               . Maintaining a VSI per VPLS instance (for bridging among 
                 Attachment and Emulated VCs) 
             
            In terms of the control-plane operation, these functions constitute: 
             
               . Signaling of Emulated Tunnels (if needed)  
               . Signaling of Emulated VCs 
               . Auto-discovery of peer PEs per VPLS instance  
               . Auto-configuration of a VPLS instance  
             
            As mentioned previously the PE needs to perform VSI functionality (such 
            as MAC address learning, flooding, and unicasting/broadcasting on a per 
            Emulated VC basis). In addition to this, if the PE is required to 
            recognize customerÆs VLANs and to provide isolation among these 
            different VLANs (by using a separate broadcast domain per VLAN), then 
            it also needs to have the capability of mapping customersÆ VLANs into 
            unique VSI identifiers if each customer assigns his or her VLANs 
            independently.    
             
          2.3. Distributed-PE Model:  
             
            Some of the main motivations behind a distributed-PE model include: 
             
               . The ability to deploy a low-cost edge device at the customer 
                 premise 
               . Improving access bandwidth efficiency by multiplexing different 
                 customer traffic (in contrast to a single-PE model located at the 
                 Service ProviderÆs POP)  
               . Improving access bandwidth efficiency by avoiding packet 
                 replication on the access uplink for multicast/broadcast traffic  
               . Improving system scalability Vs. single-PE functionality within 
                 the customer premise in terms of a) number of BGP peers, b) 
                 number of IGP peers, c) number of routes in the edge device, d) 
                 number of MPLS labels in the edge device, e) number of MPLS or IP 
                 tunnels among PEs (only a subset of routes and MPLS labels need 
                 to installed in PE-CLEs; whereas, in a single-PE model all routes 
                 and MPLS labels are installed in PEs û whether located at 
                 customer sites or Service Provider POP)  
             
            As mentioned previously, the most important data-plane functionality of 
            a VPLS-capable PE is the ability to perform VSI functionality. In the 
            case of the distribute-PE model, there are two cases that should be 
           
          Sajassi, et al           Expires September 2002                [Page 10] 
           
             
            Internet Draft   draft-sajassi-vpls-architectures-00.txt  February 2002 
             
            considered - either the PE-POP is capable of performing such 
            functionality or it is not. If the PE-POP is capable of such 
            functionality, then a true low-cost Ethernet switch based PE-CLE can be 
            used.  
             
            If the PE-POP doesnÆt have the ability to perform VSI functionality 
            (e.g., it is a router), then this functionality needs to be performed 
            by the PE-CLE. It should be noted that if a PE-CLE needs to perform 
            such functionality, then it must have similar capability as MPLS/IP 
            switches so as to support multiple virtual circuits per physical 
            interface, and to treat these VCs as logical ports of a VSI, so that it 
            can do flooding and broadcasting across these VCs per broadcast domain. 
            As mentioned before, existing Ethernet switches may not perform these 
            functions on a per VC basis. If their data-planes need to be modified 
            for such functionality, then one can easily extend them to use MPLS 
            labels or IP information as well.     
             
            Based on the above discussion, we define two types of PE-CLE. The first 
            type is an Ethernet-based PE-CLE which requires the PE-POP to perform 
            VSI functionality. The second type is an MPLS/IP-based PE-CLE, which 
            does VSI functionality and thus the PE-POP can be just an MPLS or an IP 
            router.  
             
            Based on which type of PE-CLE is used in a distributed-PE model, 
            different sets of data-plane and control-plane functions are required 
            at the PE-CLE and PE-POP. Another way of categorizing a distributed-PE 
            model, is based on control plane functionality û more specifically in 
            terms of Emulated signaling and auto-discovery. Based on these two 
            functions, there can be four categories of distributed-PE models as 
            follows: 
              
               1. Emulated signaling and auto-discovery are both performed at the 
                 PE-POP 
               2. Emulated signaling at PE-CLE and auto-discovery at PE-POP 
               3. Emulated signaling at PE-POP and auto-discovery at PE-CLE 
               4. Emulated signaling and auto-discovery are both performed at the 
                 PE-CLE 
             
            The third category does not offer any real benefits in terms of system 
            scalability and thus is not considered further. The fourth option can 
            be considered as a degenerate case for a single-PE model since the PE-
            CLE is capable of terminating and signaling Emulated VCs and performing 
            auto-discovery, it can basically perform all other functions required 
            for a VPLS service. Therefore, only the first two options are examined 
            further.

            As one might have guessed, a distributed-PE model based on Ethernet-
            based PE-CLE uses the first control-plane category (e.g., both Emulated 
            signaling and auto-discovery are performed at the PE-POP). In contrast, 
            a distributed model based on an MPLS/IP-based PE-CLE can use either the 
            first or second control-plane category. As will be shown later in 
            section 2.3.2, for an MPLS/IP-based PE-CLE, the second control-plane 
            category offers additional benefits over the first one. An example of a 
            distributed-PE model using an MPLS-based PE-CLE and the first control-
            plane category (e.g., Emulated signaling and auto-discovery both 
            performed at the PE-POP) is described in [DTLS]. 
             
            In the following two sections, reference architectures for Ethernet-
            based and MPLS/IP-based PE-CLE are described and their relationship in 
            terms of signaling/auto-discovery categorization is further examined.  
             
          2.3.1. Ethernet-based PE-CLE 
             
            A distributed-PE model with Ethernet-based PE-CLE provides a true low-
            cost edge device and at the same time it provides all the benefits of a 
            distributed model in terms of motivational factors considered above. 
            This model provides a natural migration in offering VPLS services for 
            carriers with an existing Ethernet access network. An Ethernet-based 
            PE-CLE not only provides access bandwidth efficiency by multiplexing 
            different customers traffic but also it provides bandwidth efficiency 
            by not replicating frames over its access uplink connected to the PE-
            POP (which is not the case for MPLS/IP-based PE-CLEs). Also, since in 
            this model, the PE-POP performs both Emulated VC signaling and auto-
            discovery, all the signaling and routing scalability issues are 
            addressed as well.  
             
            Now lets examine the reference architecture for this model with respect 
            to its components. Since Ethernet-based PE-CLEs donÆt support VSI 
            functionality (e.g., MAC address learning, flooding, forwarding, etc.) 
            based on virtual connections per broadcast domain, Emulated VCs must be 
            terminated in the PE-POP. Also, since Emulated VCs signaling is 
            performed at the PE-POP, the auto-discovery should also be performed 
            there as well (auto-discovery is used for end-point identification in 
            setting up Emulated VCs). This means that the Ethernet-based PE-CLE 
            model fits very naturally into the first control-plane categorization 
            of Emulated signaling and auto-discovery being performed at the PE-POP.  
             
            Now that the Emulated VCs are terminated at the PE-POP and the VSIs are 
            also located at the PE-POP, the question is how to get to the 
            Attachment VCs that come into the PE-CLE (it should be noted that 
            Emulated VCs are always terminated at the node that has the VSI 
            functionality). There are two possible options: 
           
          Sajassi, et al           Expires September 2002                [Page 12] 
           
             
            Internet Draft   draft-sajassi-vpls-architectures-00.txt  February 2002 
             
             
               1. To tunnel the Attachment VCs from the PE-CLE to the PE-POP and do 
                 further processing of the Attachment VCs at the PE-POP 
               2. To extend the Attachment VCs from the PE-CLE into the PE-POP 
                 using Extension VCs (e.g., by mapping Attachments VCs into 
                 Extension VCs at the PE-CLE) 
             
            The tunneling of the Attachment VCs can be performed by placing an 
            outer .1q tag over a given customer traffic. This is also referred to 
            as .1q-in-.1q encapsulation or for short QinQ. The provision of an 
            Ethernet switch for this functionality is rather simple and a number of 
            vendors currently provide such functionality in their Ethernet 
            switches. The main advantage of this approach is that it requires no 
            modifications to Ethernet switches that can support QinQ encapsulation 
            and so these switches can be readily used as PE-CLEs. If the Service 
            Provider is required to recognize customersÆ VLANs, then the PE-POP 
            requires the capability of creating a unique VSI identifier per 
            customerÆs VLAN by looking at both the outer and the inner .1q tags 
            which is referred to as double-tag lookup. However, if the Service 
            Provider is not required to recognize customersÆ VLANs, then no double-
            tag lookup functionality is needed at the PE-POP and the PE-POP can 
            simply use the outer .1q tag as the VSI identifier since the outer tag 
            has been assigned to ensure uniqueness at each PE-POP. 
             
            The second option of extending the Attachment VCs into the PE-POP 
            requires additional functionality in the PE-CLE that may not be 
            currently available in Ethernet-based switches. This functionality 
            allows the mapping of a customer VLAN (e.g., Attachment VC) into an 
            internal VLAN (Extension VC), which is unique within the PE-CLE. This 
            mapping is needed when separate VPLS instances need to be maintained 
            per customer VLANs in order to provide isolation among customerÆs VLANs 
            (e.g., customersÆ VLANs can overlap with each other and the Service 
            Provider does not impose any restriction in customersÆ VLAN assignment 
            per [VPLS-REQ]). It should be noted that this option is not needed if 
            the Service Provider doesnÆt need to recognize customersÆ VLANs and 
            thus the first option without double-tag lookup at the PE-POP is 
            sufficient. 
             
            In summary, in a distributed-PE model based on Ethernet-based PE-CLE, 
            the VPLS functions are distributed between the PE-CLE and the PE-POP, 
            with the following functions being performed at the PE-CLE: 
             
               . Tunneling of Attachment VCs to the PE-POP OR; 
               . Attachment VC termination and origination of Extension VCs toward 
                 the PE-POP

            And the following VPLS functions are performed in the PE-POP: 
             
               . Attachment Tunnels termination (if used) 
               . Attachment VC termination OR Extension VC termination 
               . Emulated VCs - signaling and termination 
               . Emulated Tunnels û signaling and termination 
               . Maintaining a VSI per VPLS instance  
               . Auto-discovery 
               . Auto-configuration 
             
             
          2.3.2. MPLS/IP-based PE-CLE 
             
            In cases where the PE-POP is an MPLS or an IP router without switching 
            capability, the task of performing VSI functionality reside in the PE-
            CLE. The Emulated VCs can be setup at the PE-CLE using either MPLS or 
            IP encapsulation - thus the name MPLS/IP-based PE-CLE.   
             
            In this distributed-PE model, the Emulated VCs are terminated at the 
            PE-CLE and the bridging functionality between a customerÆs Attachment 
            VCs and the corresponding Emulated VCs are provided using a VSI per 
            VPLS at the PE-CLE. Unlike the Ethernet-based PE-CLE, there is no need 
            for Attachment tunnels or Extension VCs since the VSIs are located in 
            the PE-CLEs. 
             
            As mentioned previously, there are two types of control-plane options 
            for this distributed-PE model: a) to have both Emulated signaling and 
            Auto-discovery performed at the PE-POP and b) to have Emulated 
            signaling at the PE-CLE and Auto-discovery at the PE-POP. It should be 
            noted that in both options, the termination of the Emulated VCs is 
            performed at the PE-CLE (Emulated VCs are terminated in the same node 
            that has the VSI functionality). However, in the first option, the 
            signaling of Emulated VCs is done among the PE-POPs and then the 
            relevant information is conveyed to the PE-CLEs; whereas, in the second 
            option, the signaling of Emulated VCs is done directly between the PE-
            CLEs (e.g., using directed LDP). 
             
            The advantage of performing the signaling for Emulated VCs at the PE-
            CLE is that the Emulated VC gets setup as a single segment VC between 
            the two PE-CLEs and furthermore, the Emulated VC is transparent to the 
            PE-POP (e.g., only Emulated Tunnels would be visible to the PE-POPs and 
            therefore, there is less overhead in terms of configuration, state 
            information and processing for the PE-POP). However, if the signaling 
            of Emulated VCs is performed at the PE-POP, then the Emulated VC will 
            have multiple segments and multiple sets of labels (e.g., one set for 
            each segment) need to be assigned as suggested by [DTLS] û one set of 
           
          Sajassi, et al           Expires September 2002                [Page 14] 
           
             
            Internet Draft   draft-sajassi-vpls-architectures-00.txt  February 2002 
             
            labels for the customer-facing segment at each PE and another set for 
            the WAN/MAN segment.  
             
            In addition to the configuration burden of maintaining multiple sets of 
            labels, there is additional overhead for coordinating and installing 
            routes among these different label sets. Because of the drawbacks of 
            signaling of Emulated VCs at the PE-POP, this option is not considered 
            any further and instead in section 10.3, the operational scenario for a 
            single-segment Emulated VC (e.g., signaling of Emulated VCs at the PE-
            CLE) will be elaborated upon further. 
             
            Based on the single-segment Emulated VC model (e.g., signaling of 
            Emulated VCs to be done at the PE-CLE), the VPLS functions can be 
            partitioned as follow with the following functions residing at the PE-
            CLE: 
             
               . Attachment VCs termination 
               . Emulated VCs û termination and signaling 
               . Emulated Tunnels û signaling and termination 
               . Maintaining a VSI per VPLS instance 
             
            And the following functions residing at the PE-POP: 
             
               . Auto-discovery 
               . Auto-configuration 
             
             
          3. Emulated VCs  
             
            For a VPLS system, a set of Emulated VCs is used to connect different 
            VSIs belonging to the same VPLS instance. Therefore, Emulated VCs are 
            terminated at the nodes with VSI functionality.  
             
            For a VPLS system over an MPLS network, the encapsulation of Emulated 
            VCs are performed based on [L2ENCAP] and the corresponding signaling is 
            performed based on [L2SIG]. 
             
            For a VPLS system over an IP network, the encapsulation and the 
            signaling of the Emulated VCs can be performed based on [L2TPv3]. 
             
            We define two additional types of Emulated VCs for a VPLS system that 
            are the counterparts of the Ethernet VCs defined in [L2SIG] for non-
            VPLS L2VPN: 
             
            VC Type   Description 
             
           
          Sajassi, et al           Expires September 2002                [Page 15]

            0x000C    VLAN VPLS  
            0x000D    Ethernet VPLS 
             
            The reason for the definition of these two types of VCs is that the 
            system operation with respect to transport of VLAN tagged and untagged 
            frames, as well as handling of control packets and BPDUs, differs for 
            each of these VC types. 
             
            An Emulated VC, which is of type VLAN VPLS, corresponds to a single 
            customerÆs VLAN. Therefore, for scenarios where the Service Provider 
            needs to recognize customersÆ VLANs and provide a separate broadcast 
            domain for different VLANs, then this Emulated VC type is used. 
            Furthermore, only the frames with the specified tag are allowed to be 
            transported over this Emulated VC. The Emulated VC of type VLAN VPLS 
            corresponds to customersÆ UNI ports that are multiplexed (e.g., each 
            UNI ports carries multiple Attachment VCs). A customer UNI port is a 
            physical port between the customerÆs CE and the Service ProviderÆs PE. 
             
            However, an Emulated VC of type Ethernet VPLS corresponds to all the 
            traffic that comes through a customer UNI port û both VLAN tagged and 
            untagged traffic including BPDUs. In other words, the Emulated VC acts 
            as a pseudo wire corresponding to the customerÆs Ethernet port. This 
            type of Emulated VC is used in applications where the Service Provider 
            doesnÆt need to recognize customersÆ VLANs and thus it only provides a 
            single broadcast domain (e.g., single VPLS) per customer or set of 
            customerÆs ports. This type of Emulated VC can be also viewed as 
            corresponding to customersÆ UNI ports that are not multiplexed (e.g., 
            each UNI ports corresponds to a single Attachment VC).  
             
            In multiplex UNI scenarios for LAN bridging applications, not only 
            isolation of customersÆ VLANs are needed (and different VLANs can go to 
            different switches (CEs)) but also BPDUs packets need to be transported 
            among these switches. For these applications, besides having a separate 
            set of Emulated VCs of type VLAN VPLS for each customerÆs VLAN, another 
            set of Emulated VCs of the same type is used for untagged frames 
            including BPDUs. Therefore, in multiplex UNI applications, the untagged 
            frames are transported over the Emulated VCs of type VLAN VPLS (e.g., 
            untagged frames can be considered as frames with special tags).    
             
            It is important that these two types of Emulated VCs be differentiated 
            and processed accordingly by the PEs involved in setting up a VPLS 
            instance, since during the auto-configuration it provides a 
            compatibility check between Attachment VCs and their corresponding 
            Emulated VCs.

          4. Emulated Tunnels  
             
            An Emulated Tunnel is used to carry Emulated VCs between two PEs and to 
            make them transparent to the P nodes within the network. The general 
            requirements for these tunnels are given in [L2ARCH]. The Emulated 
            Tunnels are setup based on one of the existing methods specified for 
            L3VPNs [L3ARCH] and are independent from L2VPN applications (e.g., if 
            MPLS is used then tunnels can be either MPLS-TE using RSVP signaling or 
            can be regular MPLS LSP using LDP signaling). 
             
            In the reference architectures that we have defined for the single-PE 
            and both of the distributed-PE models, the Emulated Tunnels are 
            terminated at the same node where the Emulated VCs themselves are 
            terminated. This means in the case of the distributed-PE model with 
            Ethernet-based PE-CLE, the tunnels are terminated at the PE-POP; and in 
            the case of the distributed-PE model with MPLS/IP-based PE-CLE, the 
            tunnels are terminated at the PE-CLE. 
             
          5. Attachment Tunnels 
             
            The Attachment tunnels are used only for the distributed-PE model and 
            more specifically with Ethernet-based PE-CLEs. Attachment tunnels can 
            be between PE-CLEs and PE-POPs that are either directly connected or 
            via a .1q access network. In the later case, these tunnels are 
            transparent to the .1q access network and are treated just as regular 
            VLANs with slightly larger payloads.  
             
            Attachment tunnels are formed by placing an outer .1q tag in front of 
            the frames (either tagged or untagged) entering a PE-CLE via a customer 
            UNI port. This outer tag is referred to as a PE-VLAN (Provider Edge 
            VLAN). In the case of a non-multiplexed UNI, the PE-VLAN is the same 
            for all the ports of a customer belonging to the same VPLS instance, 
            and in the case of a multiplexed UNI, the PE-VLAN is the same for all 
            the ports of a customer that share one or more VPLS instances. 
             
            The uniqueness of the PE-VLAN needs to be guaranteed within a PE-POP 
            domain since there are multiple PE-CLEs per PE-POP and PE-VLANs are 
            used to differentiate between different customers.  In other words, PE-
            VLAN is a local parameter that gets shared between PE-POP and its 
            associated PE-CLEs and it is not transported over the Emulated VCs û 
            instead it can be derived from the Emulated VCs associated with that 
            VPLS instance. 
             
            In the case of a multiplexed UNI, an Attachment tunnel is used to 
            transport all the customerÆs VLANs (e.g., Attachment VCs) to the PE-POP 
            and at the PE-POP both the PE-VLAN and CE-VLAN are used together as a

            VSI identifier (e.g., the double-tag lookup mechanism described 
            previously). However, for a non-multiplex UNI, the Attachment tunnel 
            degenerates into carrying only a single Attachment VC associated with 
            that UNI and at the PE-POP only the PE-VLAN is used as a VSI 
            identifier.

            as they are carried between PE-CLE and PE-POP. The encapsulation format

          5.2. Signaling 
             
            To configure an Attachment tunnel between the PE-CLE and the PE-POP, 
            the minimum piece of information that needs to be passed to the PE-CLE 
            is a) Attachment tunnel ID or PE-VLAN and b) customer-ID/VPN-ID 
            associated with the Attachment tunnel ID or PE-VLAN. The PE-CLE, upon 
            receiving the message that contains the association between PE-VLAN and 
            customer-ID/VPN-ID, looks for which of its ports are configured for 
            that customer-ID/VPN-ID and then applies the PE-VLAN ID to the 
            respective port(s).  
           
          Sajassi, et al           Expires September 2002                [Page 18] 
           
             
            Internet Draft   draft-sajassi-vpls-architectures-00.txt  February 2002 
             
             
            If in addition to the Attachment tunnel configuration, the PE-CLEÆs 
            port(s) configuration is also done through the PE-POP, then the PE-POP 
            can resolve the association between PE-VLAN and the associated port and 
            thus sending the PE-VLAN + port-ID information along with port 
            configuration information to the PE-CLE (e.g., PE-CLE does not need to 
            receive customer-ID/VPN-ID info). It should be noted that if the PE-
            CLEÆs port configuration is done via the PE-POP, then this shall 
            include all relevant configuration information including QoS parameters 
            and thus the signaling protocol shall support it as well. 
             
            Signaling of the Attachment Tunnels can be accomplished through 
            extensions to an existing protocol (e.g., VLAN Trunking Protocol) and 
            these extensions would only require software changes to the Ethernet-
            based PE-CLE (no hardware/ASIC changes are required). This signaling 
            protocol along with its extensions will be specified in the future. 
             
          6. Extension VCs 
             
            Extension VCs are used in conjunction with Ethernet-based PE-CLE in the 
            distributed-PE model for multiplexed UNI ports and they are used in 
            lieu of the Attachment tunnels. Since Extension VCs are only used for 
            multiplexed UNI ports, the PE-CLE is required to have VLAN-mapping 
            capability, which may not be currently available in standard Ethernet 
            switches. This capability is needed in order to map overlapping VLANs 
            of different customers into unique internal VLANs (PE-VLANs) so that at 
            the PE-POP, these PE-VLANs can be used as a VSI identifier.  
             
                                    
          6.1. Encapsulation 
             
            Encapsulation format for Extension VCs is exactly the same as 802.1q 
            since only customersÆ VLANs are mapped to PE-VLANs and everything else 
            remains the same. 
           
           
          6.2. Signaling 
           
            Similar to the Attachment tunnels, a signaling protocol can be used to 
            configure the Extension VCs between the PE-CLE and the PE-POP. At the 
            minimum, the signaling protocol needs to convey the PE-VLAN and the 
            associated VPN-ID to the PE-CLE. The PE-CLE uses the VPN-ID to identify 
            which VLAN under which port needs to be mapped to a given PE-VLAN. 
             
            Again similar to the Attachment tunnels, if besides configuration of 
            the Extension VCs, PE-CLEÆs ports and VLANs also need to be configured 
           
          Sajassi, et al           Expires September 2002                [Page 19] 
           
             
            Internet Draft   draft-sajassi-vpls-architectures-00.txt  February 2002 
             
            via the PE-POP, then only PE-VLAN information needs to be passed to PE-
            CLE along with customer port and VLAN configuration (e.g., no need to 
            pass VPN-ID information to the PE-CLE since the PE-POP can already 
            resolve the association between PE-VLAN and customer port-ID + VLAN). 
             
            Signaling of the Extension VCs can also be accomplished through 
            extensions to an existing protocol (e.g., VLAN Trunking Protocol) and 
            these extensions would only require software changes to the Ethernet-
            based PE-CLE. This signaling protocol along with its extensions will be 
            specified in the future. 
             
          7. Virtual Switch Instance 
             
            As mentioned previously, for a customerÆs VPLS, there exist a VSI in 
            each PE associated with that VPLS. The VSI, as its name implies, is a 
            virtual switch that can have logical ports (e.g., virtual circuits) as 
            its interfaces. Therefore, it has the ability to do regular 
            bridge/switch functionality such as MAC address learning/aging, 
            flooding, forwarding (unicasting, multicasting/broadcasting), and 
            running STP (if needed) per broadcast domain but based on its logical 
            ports (regular Ethernet switches may only perform these functions on 
            their physical ports).  
             
            In the case of distributed-PE models, VSIs can be located either in PE-
            CLEs or PE-POPs based on their capabilities as described previously.  
            VSIs of a VPLS are connected to each other through Emulated VCs, which 
            act as pseudo wires. If all the VSIs are connected directly with each 
            other through a full mesh of Emulated VCs, then one can avoid running 
            STP in the PEs by disabling packet forwarding between any two Emulated 
            VCs in a VSI (e.g., packets arriving from Emulated VCs have to go out 
            on Attachment VCs). This is referred to as Split Horizon in [TLS]. 
            However, if the VSIs are not directly connected with each other, then 
            loops can exist and other means for loop prevention shall be devised. 
            The use of STP in such scenarios is for further study. It should be 
            noted that if STP were used for loop prevention between the PEs, then 
            it would be different from the customersÆ STPs (e.g., customersÆ BPDUs 
            are tunneled transparently through the network). 
             
            Although, customersÆ BPDUs are passed transparently through the 
            providerÆs network, there can exist certain scenarios that would 
            require monitoring of the customerÆs BPDUs and taking the appropriate 
            action. For example, if a customer is running 802.1w and there is a 
            change in their network topology, then the corresponding VSI upon 
            receiving a Topology Change Notification (TCN) shall flush the MAC 
            addresses learned from all other ports except the one on which it 
            received the TCN. This processing is needed in order to achieve 
           
          Sajassi, et al           Expires September 2002                [Page 20] 
           
             
            Internet Draft   draft-sajassi-vpls-architectures-00.txt  February 2002 
             
            convergence time in the order of milliseconds provided by 802.1w. Also, 
            in some other scenarios where 802.1w is not used, monitoring of 
            customersÆ BPDUs may be needed for accelerating aging timeouts of all 
            portsÆ MAC addresses upon receiving a TCN. 
             
             
          8. Auto Discovery 
             
            Auto-discovery is used to discover all the PEs associated with a VPLS 
            instance for setting up Emulated VCs among the corresponding VSIs. 
            There are two basic mechanisms for auto-discovery. One is based on 
            Directory Services and it is described in [DIR-AUTO] and the other is 
            base on BGP that is first described as part of [L3ARCH] and has been 
            extended and generalized in [BGP-AUTO]. 
             
            In Directory-based auto-discovery, IP addresses of all participating 
            PEs for a VPLS are added as records under the VPN-ID (e.g., domain 
            name) in the directory. When a new Attachment VC is configured, it is 
            configured with a VPN-ID and the PE queries the directory for the IP 
            addresses of all other PEs for that VPLS and then tries to establish an 
            Emulated VC (if one doesnÆt already exist) between its VSI and other 
            VSIs within the VPLS system.   
             
            In BGP-based auto-discovery, similar to the Directory-based scheme, the 
            VPN-ID is associated with Attachment VCs when they are configured; 
            however, in contrast with the Directory-based approach, the IP 
            addresses of the member PEs need not to be entered in another server. 
            Instead, each PE running the BGP protocol distributes its VPN-ID 
            information along with its IP address to all other PEs through MP-BGP 
            Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI).   
             
            In the case of the distributed-PE model (either Ethernet-based or 
            MPLS/IP-based), the Directory query or BGP protocol is performed by the 
            PE-POP. Furthermore, if the distributed-PE model is MPLS/IP-based, then 
            the discovered information (e.g., IP addresses of the peer PEs) for a 
            VPLS need to be conveyed to the PE-CLE since Emulated VCs are set up 
            from there (e.g., single-segment Emulated VC between two PE-CLEs).  
             
             
          9. Auto Configuration 
             
            Auto-configuration is used to tie all the pieces of a VPLS together. 
            Sometimes auto-discovery and auto-configuration are used loosely and in 
            lieu of each other; however, we make a clear distinction between them 
            in order to clearly define the functionality of each. Auto-discovery is 
            only limited to member discovery of a VPLS instance (e.g., IP addresses 
           
          Sajassi, et al           Expires September 2002                [Page 21] 
           
             
            Internet Draft   draft-sajassi-vpls-architectures-00.txt  February 2002 
             
            of all the PEs participating in a VPLS). However, auto-configuration 
            uses some components of a VPLS (including auto-discovery) as a 
            triggering mechanism for configuring other components of that VPLS.  
             
            As mentioned previously a VPLS can be defined by a quintuple set as 
            follows: <ingress Attachment VCs, ingress VSIs, Emulated VCs, egress 
            VSIs, and egress Attachment VCs>. When an Attachment VC is configured 
            and becomes active, auto-configuration associates the Attachment VC to 
            a VSI for that VPLS, and uses it to trigger auto-discovery for finding 
            member PEs. Upon discovery of the member PEs, the auto-configuration 
            uses the information to trigger configuration of Emulated VCs if they 
            are not already setup by previous triggers.  
             
            Since an Emulated VC is a full-duplex circuit and it consists of two 
            uni-directional circuits, when configuring an Emulated VC, both 
            circuits need to be configured. We use the single-sided signaling 
            mechanism for L2VPNs as described in [SS-SIG] for this purpose, which 
            basically means the setup of the return leg is triggered by the setup 
            of the forward leg. The signaling of the Emulated VC also triggers the 
            activation of the egress Attachment VC if it is not already activated. 
            Auto-discovery in conjunction with single-sided signaling helps to 
            confine the configuration changes for adding a new customer site to a 
            single PE. Therefore, upon configuring the Attachment VC associated 
            with the new customer site on the corresponding PE, the configuration 
            of all other pieces is done automatically as described above. It should 
            be noted that in the case of Directory-based auto-discovery, the 
            Directory server might also need to be configured (for adding the IP 
            address of the PE associated with the new site as a new record under 
            the domain name if it doesnÆt exist).  
             
            In the case of a distributed-PE model where the configuration of 
            Attachment VCs is performed at the PE-POP, then auto-configuration 
            causes the configuration of an Attachment VC to also trigger the 
            signaling to the PE-CLE. In the case of an Ethernet-based PE-CLE, the 
            signaling is for configuring Attachment tunnels or Extension VCs at the 
            PE-CLE as well as configuring the Attachment VCs at the PE-CLE. In the 
            case of an MPLS/IP-based PE-CLE, the signaling is for conveying the 
            VPLS membership information (e.g., IP addresses of associated PEs) to 
            the PE-CLE as well as configuring the Attachment VCs at the PE-CLE. 
             
             
          10. System Operation 
             
            In the following sections, we describe the system operation for 
            different VPLS system architectures in terms of control and data plane 
            operation. 
           
          Sajassi, et al           Expires September 2002                [Page 22] 
           
             
            Internet Draft   draft-sajassi-vpls-architectures-00.txt  February 2002 
             
             
          10.1. Single-PE 
             
            In setting up a VPLS for a customer, first different components of the 
            VPLS (Attachment VCs, Emulated VCs, and VSIs) need to be configured and 
            hooked up to each other and next forwarding information needs to be 
            installed in the VSIs. The former task is done within the domain of the 
            control plane by use of different signaling protocols and auto-
            configuration. The later task of installing forwarding information is 
            done solely in the data plane by use of MAC address learning and 
            flooding (this is in contrast to L3VPN where control plane is used for 
            installing prefix information).  
             
            Thus, a VPLS can be considered a collection of virtual switches 
            connected with each other and to customersÆ devices via logical ports 
            and the control plane is used for setting up these virtual switches and 
            connecting them with each other and the customersÆ devices. 
             
            Lets look at the control plane operation for a VPLS in more details. 
            Upon configuring an Attachment circuit at a PE (for connection to a new 
            customerÆs site), the auto-configuration mechanism on that PE triggers 
            auto-discovery (either using BGP or DNS) to discover other PEs 
            participating in this VPLS. Then the PE tries to setup an Emulated VC 
            between its VSI and every other VSI of the discovered PEs if one 
            already doesnÆt exist. Once the setup of the Emulated VCs is completed, 
            then the new Attachment VC is connected to the VPLS and the new CE can 
            participate in data plane functionality.  
             
            The operation of the data plane is the same as for regular Ethernet 
            switches except that the VSIs have the capability to perform Ethernet 
            functionality (MAC address learning, flooding, forwarding, and so on) 
            based on logical ports as mentioned previously. Once the VSIs learn the 
            MAC addresses of the new CE and associated them with the logical ports 
            over which they come from, then they perform Layer-2 forwarding based 
            on these MAC addresses.    
             
             
          10.2. Distributed-PE with Ethernet-based PE-CLE 
             
            A VPLS in this model can be considered as a collection of virtual 
            switches connected with each other via Emulated VCs and connected to 
            customersÆ devices via Attachment VCs and either Attachment Tunnels or 
            Extension VCs. Therefore, the network-side of the VSI in this case is 
            the same as the one for single-PE model, and configuration and 
            operation of Emulated VCs are the same as the single-PE model and are

            The customer-facing side of the VSI is different and it is connected to 
            customersÆ devices via Attachment VCs in conjunction with Extension VCs 
            or Attachment tunnels. As described previously, when configuring 
            Attachment VCs via the PE-POP, the IDs for Attachment Tunnels or 
            Extension VCs are allocated by the PE-POP and conveyed to the PE-CLEs 
            via the appropriate signaling along with Attachment VCs configuration 
            information. The PE-CLE in turn uses this information to setup its end 
            of the Attachment Tunnels or Extension VCs as well as setting up the 
            Attachment VCs to the CEs. Once all the pieces are setup, the VPLS is 
            ready for data-plane operation. 
             
            In case of the Attachment Tunnels for non-multiplexed UNI ports, all 
            the customerÆs traffic on a port (either tagged or untagged) gets sent 
            through the Attachment tunnel to the PE-POP and at the PE-POP based on 
            the tunnel ID, the corresponding VSI associated with that VPLS is 
            selected and the traffic is switched through. It should be noted that 
            in the case of a non-multiplexed UNI port, the VPLS and in turn the 
            associated VSIs are transparent to customerÆs VLANs. However, for the 
            multiplexed UNI ports, the VPLS is associated with a given customerÆs 
            VLAN and thus it is important to examine the customerÆs VLANs (e.g., 
            Attachment VCs) at the PE-POP. Since customersÆ VLANs can overlap with 
            each other, in order to uniquely identify them, both Attachment Tunnel 
            ID and Attachment VC ID needs to be looked at together (e.g., double-
            tag lookup) to identify the corresponding VSI. After VSI 
            identification, the packets are forwarded to their destinations based 
            on their destination MAC address. It should be noted that when 
            Attachment Tunnels are used for multiplexed ports, the PE-CLE is 
            oblivious to the Attachment VCs carried inside these tunnels. 
            Therefore, if there are more than one customer site connected to the 
            same PE-CLE and these sites use overlapping MAC addresses across 
            different VLANs, then these VLANs are not isolated from one another at 
            the PE-CLE. Although such situations are rare, itÆs worth mentioning 
            that there are solutions for this scenario such as the use of sticky 
            MAC addresses; however, because of the rarity of this scenario, they 
            will not be discussed here. 
             
            If Extension VCs are used in lieu of Attachment tunnels for multiplexed 
            UNI ports, then the Extension VC ID can be used directly to identify 
            the corresponding VSI. However, as mentioned previously, in order to 
            use the Extension VCs, the PE-CLE must have the ability to map between 
            the Attachment VCs and the Extension VCs at the ingress port. This 
            mapping is needed in order to map overlapping customersÆ VLAN IDs into 
            unique Extension VCs for proper identification of the VSIs. Once a VSI 
            is selected, then packet forwarding is performed as before.

          10.3. Distributed-PE with MPLS/IP-based PE-CLE 
             
            In this model virtual switches can be considered connected with each 
            other via longer logical ports (Emulated VCs) that span across multiple 
            Service Provider devices (PE-CLEs and PE-POPs). In the previous cases, 
            an Emulated VC was either between two PEs or between two PE-POPs. 
            However, in this case an Emulated VC is between two PE-CLEs and it 
            passes through the PE-POPs transparently. The difference between this 
            distributed-PE model and the single-PE model is primarily in the 
            control plane and once the Emulated VCs are setup among the VSIs, then 
            the data-plane operation is identical to the one for the single-PE 
            model (whereas, the same thing can not be said for the distributed-PE 
            model with Ethernet-based PE-CLE).  
              
            Since Emulated VCsÆ setup is originated from the PE-CLE, the tunneling 
            of these VCs also needs to be originated from the PE-CLE. As discussed 
            before, a signaling protocol is used to pass the IP addresses of other 
            PE-CLEs discovered via the auto-discovery mechanism from the PE-POP to 
            the PE-CLE. Upon receiving the IP addresses, the PE-CLE installs them 
            in its routing table and then uses them as /32 prefixes to establish 
            the tunnels (for Emulated VCs). The tunnel establishment is done 
            through one of the existing methods (e.g., downstream unsolicited LDP, 
            RSVP-TE, and so on). When tunnels are established, then a directed LDP 
            session is setup for Emulated VC signaling between this PE-CLE and the 
            other discovered PE-CLEs for that VPLS. It should also be noted that if 
            the configuration of the PE-CLE is done through the PE-POP, then the 
            PE-POP can also be configured with the IP address of the PE-CLE and 
            convey this IP address to the PE-CLE via the signaling protocol; 
            however, if the Attachment VCs in the PE-CLE are not configured through 
            the PE-POP, then a simple IGP protocol such as RIP can be used to pass 
            the IP address of the PE-CLE to the PE-POP. 
             
            Once the Attachment VCs are configured and the Emulated VCs are setup 
            at the PE-CLE to connect the VSI to other VSIs, then the VPLS is ready 
            for its data-plane operation and furthermore its data-plane operates 
            exactly as the one for the single-PE model. 
             
             
          11. Security Considerations 
              
            The security aspects of each VPLS architecture will be discussed at a 
            later time.
