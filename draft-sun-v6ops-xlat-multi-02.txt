Abstract

   The IPv6 transition has been an ongoing process throughout the world
   due to the exhaustion of the IPv4 address space.  The 464XLAT
   [RFC6877] provides a solution with limited IPv4 connectivity across
   an IPv6-only network, and the android system (version 2.3 and above)
   has already implemented the 464XLAT and the Prefix discovery solution
   [RFC7050].  However, the current 464XLAT architecture can only deal
   with the scenario with single PLAT in the network.  When operator
   deploys multiple PLATs with different Pref64 prefixes, 464XLAT cannot
   cope with multiple prefixes for different destination addresses.

   This document describes the architecture with multiple PLATs and also
   the deployment considerations.

1.  Introduction

   The exhaustion of the IPv4 address space has been a practical problem
   that providers are facing today.  Network address migration to IPv6
   is ongoing or upcoming throughout the world.  The 464XLAT
   architecture uses the IPv4/IPv6 translation technology standardized
   in [RFC6145] and [RFC6146].  It encourages the IPv6 transition by
   making IPv4 service reachable across IPv6-only networks and providing
   IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity to IPv4 or IPv6 servers and peers of
   single-stack.  The android system (version 4.3 and above) has already
   implemented the 464XLAT [RFC6877] and the Prefix discovery method in
   [RFC7050].

Internet-Draft      Running Multiple PLATs in 464XLAT          June 2015


   However, as described in section 6.3 [RFC6877], the CLAT will use the
   PLAT-side translation IPv6 prefix as the destination of all
   translation packets that require stateful translation to the IPv4
   Internet.  The Prefix Discovery method [RFC7050] cannot deal with the
   scenario when different PLATs are using with different Pref64
   prefixes.

   This document describes the solution of 464XLAT architecture with
   multiple PLATs and some deployment considerations

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document use the terminologies defined in [RFC6877] and
   [RFC7050].

3.  Requirement of Multiple PLATs in 464XLAT

   As defined in [RFC6147], it allows the implementations of DNS64 to be
   able to map specific IPv4 address ranges to separate Pref64::/n
   prefixes.  That allows handling with special use of IPv4 addresses
   [RFC6890].  Therefore, operator may deploy multiple NAT64s (PLATs in
   464XLAT) for different ranges of IPv4 servers.  For example, one PLAT
   "A" is used when accessing IPv4-only servers in the data center, and
   a different PLAT "B" is used for Internet access as described in
   Figure 1.  These two PLATs may have implemented different ALG types
   and different QoS treatment.

                       PLAT "A" ----- IPv4-only servers in a data center
                       /
     IPv6-only node---<
                       \
                        PLAT "B" ----- IPv4 Internet

                      Figure 1: Use case of MultiPLAT

   In this use case, one end user would use multiple Pref64 prefixes for
   different destinations.

   Another use case to deploy multiple PLATs is for load balancing.  For
   example, PLAT "A" would serve approximately half of the subscribers
   in one network, while PLAT "B" would serve the other half as
   described in Figure 2.

Internet-Draft      Running Multiple PLATs in 464XLAT          June 2015


                        PLAT "A" ----- half of the subscribers
                       /
     IPv6-only node---<
                       \
                        PLAT "B" ----- the other half of the subscribers

            Figure 2: Use case of MultiPLAT for load balancing

   In this use case, one end user would still get one Pref64 for all
   destinations, but it still needs a management system to allocate
   different Pref64 prefixes for different users.

4.  Overall Architecture of multiPLATs in 464XLAT

   The overall architecture of multiPLATs in 464XLAT is depicted as
   Figure 3.  It consists of a Prefix Management Server, enhanced CLAT,
   and multiple PLATs.  The PLAT in this architecture has no difference
   between the one in 464XLAT in [RFC6877].

4.1.  Prefix Management Server

   The Prefix Management Server includes the following modulars as
   described in Figure 4.

     Figure 4: The implementation modulat of Prefix Management Server

   It would be configured with the policy to allocate multiple Pref64s.
   There may be different policies to apply.  For example, it may map
   specific IPv4 destination address ranges to separate Pref64 prefixes,
   or map specific IPv6 source address ranges to separate Pref64
   prefixes, or map both destination IPv4 address and source IPv6
   address to Pref64 prefixes.  The policy in Prefix Management Server
   should be consistent with the one of the PLAT deployment.

   The prefix discovery method should be able to cope with multiple
   Pref64 prefixes.  It may implement PCP based prefix discovery method
   [RFC7225] to allocate multiple Pref64 prefixes.

4.2.  Enhanced CLAT for multiPLAT

   In addition to satisfy the requirements of existing CLAT, the
   enhanced CLAT for multiPLAT should also implement the following
   modulars as described in figure 5:

     +---------------------------------------------+
      |   +---------------+    +-----------------+  |
      |   |Pref64 Magt    |    |v4addrRange Magt |  |
      |   +---------------+    +-----------------+  |
      |           +-----------------+               |
      |           | Prefix Discovery|               |
      |           +-----------------+               |
      +---------------------------------------------+

          Figure 5: The implementation modulars of enhanced CLAT

   The prefix discovery method should be consistent with the one in the
   Prefix Management Server.  The Pref64 Management modular will extract
   the multiple Pref64 prefixes from the prefix discovery procedure and
   the v4addrRange Management modular will store the corresponding IPv4
   address ranges.  The prefix discovery method will get multiple Pref64

   prefixes after the process of authentication and IPv6 address
   allocation.  Then, the CLAT will use the Pref64 prefix as the
   destination for specific IPv4 address ranges.

   The translation and DNS modular is the same with the traditional XLAT
   in [RFC6877].

5.  Deployment Considerations

5.1.  Prefix Management

   The prefix management modular is important for multiPLATs in 464XLAT.
   However, since it would compare the destination address range with
   each packet in CLAT, it might affect the performance efficiency of
   the client.  So, operators should limit the number of address ranges,
   and aggregate the addresses into a larger address range.

   Besides, there might also be a maximum limit configured in CLAT on
   the number of Pref64 prefixes and the number of address ranges.  When
   the number of address ranges exceeds the limit, the CLAT may ignore
   the next Pref64 prefixes and use a default prefix for the rest of
   destinations.  However, this may cause issues for unexpected results.

5.2.  DNS64 Consistency

   464XLAT does not require DNS64 [RFC6147] when IPv4 host sends IPv4
   packets to reach IPv4 servers.  But 464XLAT networks may use DNS64 to
   enable single stateful translation [RFC6146].  In this case, the
   configuration policy in DNS64 should be consistent with the Prefix
   Management Server.  For example, how to map different IPv4 address
   ranges to Pref64 prefixes and IPv6 prefixes for Preference prefixes.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
