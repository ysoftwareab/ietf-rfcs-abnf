1.  Introduction

   This document defines the means by which an Abstract Syntax Notation
   One (ASN.1) [X680] specification can incorporate the definitions of
   types and elements in specifications written in other Extensible
   Markup Language (XML) [XML] schema languages.  References to
   XML Schema [XSD1] types and elements, RELAX NG [RNG] named patterns
   and elements, and Document Type Declaration (DTD) [XML] element types
   are supported.

   Non-ASN.1 definitions are supported by first defining an ASN.1 type
   whose values can contain arbitrary markup, and then defining
   constraints on that type to restrict the content to specific
   nominated datatypes from non-ASN.1 schema definitions.

   The ASN.1 definitions in this document are consolidated in
   Appendix A.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "MAY" in this document are
   to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [BCP14].  The key
   word "OPTIONAL" is exclusively used with its ASN.1 meaning.

   This specification makes use of definitions from the XML Information

   Set (Infoset) [ISET].  The term "element" shall be taken to mean an
   Infoset element information item.  The term "attribute" shall be
   taken to mean an Infoset attribute information item.

   A reference to a ASN.1 production [X680] (e.g.,
   UserDefinedConstraint) is a reference to the text in an ASN.1
   specification corresponding to that production.

3.  Representing Markup as ASN.1 Values

   A value of the AnyType ASN.1 type holds arbitrary content of an
   element (but not the start-tag and end-tag, or empty-element tag),
   plus the context required to correctly interpret that content.

      AnyType ::= SEQUENCE {
          prolog      [0] UTF8String (SIZE(1..MAX)) OPTIONAL,
          context     [1] UTF8String (SIZE(1..MAX)) OPTIONAL,
          attributes  [2] UTF8String (SIZE(1..MAX)) OPTIONAL,
          content     [3] UTF8String (SIZE(1..MAX)) OPTIONAL
      }

   With respect to some element whose content is represented by a value
   of the AnyType type:

    - the prolog component of the value contains, from the XML document
      containing the element, the text corresponding to the prolog
      production [XML], or the sufficient (well-formed and valid) part
      thereof to define the entity references appearing in the context,
      attributes and content components of the value,

    - the context component of the value contains a whitespace separated
      list of the [namespace attributes] of the ancestors of the
      element, if any, plus any [attributes] of the ancestor elements
      which are inherited by their element children,

    - the attributes component of the value contains text corresponding
      to the [attributes] of the element, if any,

    - the content component of the value contains the text of the
      content of the element between the start-tag and end-tag.  The
      component is absent if there are no characters between the
      start-tag and end-tag, or if the element uses an empty-element
      tag.

   Leading and trailing whitespace corresponding to the S production
   [XML] in the prolog, context and attributes components MAY be
   omitted.  Multiple whitespace characters corresponding to the S
   production in the prolog, context and attributes components MAY be

   replaced with a single space character.

   Any entity references in the context, attributes and content
   components MAY be replaced by their replacement text so that the
   prolog component can be omitted.

   If the prolog component is absent then XML version 1.0 is assumed.

   Note that the Robust XML Encoding Rules [RXER] have special
   provisions for encoding values of the AnyType type.  For other
   encoding rules, values of the AnyType type are encoded according to
   the ASN.1 type definition of AnyType.

   Example

   Consider the following XML document:

      <?xml version='1.0'?>
      <!DOCTYPE root [
          <!ENTITY TRUE 'true'>
      ]>
      <root xmlns:ns="http://www.example.com/SLI">
       <example ns:foo="1" bar="0">
        <this>&TRUE;</this>
        <that/>
       </example>
      </root>

   The AnyType value corresponding to the content of the <example>
   element is, in ASN.1 value notation [X680]:

      {
          prolog     { "<?xml version='1.0'?>", lf,
                       "<!DOCTYPE root [", lf
                       "    <!ENTITY TRUE 'true'>", lf
                       "]>", lf },
          context    "xmlns:ns=""http://www.example.com/SLI>""",
          attributes " ns:foo=""1"" bar=""0""",
          content    { lf,
                       "  <this>&TRUE;</this>", lf,
                       "  <that/>", lf, " " }
      }

   The following AnyType value is also an acceptable representation of
   the content of the <example> element:

      {
          context    "xmlns:ns=""http://www.example.com/SLI>""",



Legg & Prager             Expires 19 June 2004                  [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT      XED: Schema Language Integration   December 19, 2003


          attributes "bar=""0"" ns:foo=""1""",
          content    { lf,
                       "  <this>true</this>", lf,
                       "  <that/>", lf, " " }
      }

   By itself the AnyType ASN.1 type imposes no datatype restriction on
   the markup contained by its values, and is therefore analogous to the
   XML Schema anyType [XSD1].

   There is no ASN.1 notation that can directly impose the constraint
   that a value of the AnyType type must conform to the markup allowed
   by a specific non-ASN.1 definition.  However, UserDefinedConstraint
   notation can be exploited to provide parameters to nominated
   predefined constraints that have the desired effect.  A predefined
   constraint is identified by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER value passed as a
   parameter in a UserDefinedConstraint.

   Though the UserDefinedConstraint notation does not express the
   semantics of a constraint, multi-schema aware ASN.1 tools can
   recognize particular OBJECT IDENTIFIER values (defined later in this
   document) and behave appropriately.  These OBJECT IDENTIFIER values
   have id-constraint as a common prefix.

      id-constraint OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
          { iso(1) 2 36 79672281 xed(3) constraint(1) }

4.  Supporting ASN.1 Types

   The section defines ASN.1 types that support the application of
   constraints on the markup allowed in values of the AnyType ASN.1
   type.

4.1.  The AnyURI Type

   A value of the AnyURI ASN.1 type is a URI character string [URI].

      AnyURI ::= UTF8String (CONSTRAINED BY
                  { -- conforms to the format of a URI -- })

4.2.  The NCName Type

   A value of the NCName ASN.1 type is a character string conforming to
   the NCName production of Namespaces in XML [XMLNS].

      NCName ::= UTF8String (CONSTRAINED BY
                     { -- conforms to the NCName production of
                       -- Namespaces in XML -- })

5.  Referencing Foreign Types

   To incorporate a non-ASN.1 datatype into an ASN.1 specification it is
   necessary to constraint values of the AnyType ASN.1 type to contain
   only markup valid with respect to that datatype.

   XML Schema and RELAX NG both have distinct definitional forms for
   elements and types (named patterns in RELAX NG).  A DTD element type
   declaration can be regarded as defining either a complete element, or
   the content of an element (i.e., a type).

   The values of the AnyType ASN.1 type can be restricted to conform to
   a specific XML Schema named type or RELAX NG named pattern, or to
   conform to the content specified by a nominated DTD element type
   declaration, by applying a UserDefinedConstraint containing the value
   of id-constraint-xml-type as a parameter.

      id-constraint-xml-type OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-constraint 0 }

   A UserDefinedConstraint in which an OBJECT IDENTIFIER with the value
   of id-constraint-xml-type is used MUST satisfy all of the following
   conditions:

   a) there SHALL be three or four UserDefinedConstraintParameters,

   b) the first UserDefinedConstraintParameter SHALL be a Value of the
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ASN.1 type and that Value SHALL be the same as
      id-constraint-xml-type,

   c) the second UserDefinedConstraintParameter SHALL be a Value of the
      AnyURI ASN.1 type (possibly an empty string),

   d) the third UserDefinedConstraintParameter SHALL be a Value of the
      NCName ASN.1 type,

   e) the fourth UserDefinedConstraintParameter, if present, SHALL be a
      Value of the AnyURI ASN.1 type,

   f) taken together the second and third UserDefinedConstraintParameter
      SHALL be the namespace name and local name [XMLNS] of either an
      XML Schema type definition, a RELAX NG named pattern, or a DTD
      element type declaration.

   The fourth UserDefinedConstraintParameter is used when the namespace
   name and local name reference is ambiguous, i.e., refers to
   definitions in more than one schema document.  This situation would
   occur, for example, when importing types with the same name from
   independently developed XML Schemas defined without a target



Legg & Prager             Expires 19 June 2004                  [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT      XED: Schema Language Integration   December 19, 2003


   namespace.  The value of the fourth UserDefinedConstraintParameter is
   a URI that indicates the intended schema document, either an
   XML Schema specification, a RELAX NG specification, or a DTD.

   Example

      AnyType (CONSTRAINED BY {
                  OBJECT IDENTIFIER:
                      { iso(1) 2 36 79672281 xed(3) constraint(1) 0 },
                  AnyURI:"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema",
                  NCName:"decimal" })

   The XML-Type and XML-Type-From-Schema parameterized types [X683] are
   defined so that XML Schema named types, RELAX NG named patterns and
   DTD element type declarations can be more conveniently referenced.

      XML-Type { AnyURI:namespace, NCName:name } ::= AnyType
          (CONSTRAINED BY { OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id-constraint-xml-type,
              AnyURI:namespace, NCName:name })

      XML-Type-From-Schema { AnyURI:namespace, NCName:name,
              AnyURI:schemaIdentity } ::= AnyType
          (CONSTRAINED BY { OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id-constraint-xml-type,
              AnyURI:namespace, NCName:name, AnyURI:schemaIdentity })

   For example, the following notation is sufficient to incorporate the
   xsd:decimal XML Schema type as the member type in a SEQUENCE OF type
   definition:

      SEQUENCE OF number
          XML-Type { "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema", "decimal" }

   Note that the ASN.1 Schema [ASD] translation of this ASN.1 type
   provides a more natural way to reference the XML Schema decimal type:

      <type xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
       <sequenceOf/>
        <element name="number" type="xsd:decimal"/>
       </sequenceOf>
      </type>

   The XML-Type parameterized type cannot be used if the URI of a schema
   document is required to disambiguate the namespace name and local
   name.

6.  Referencing Foreign Elements

   ASN.1 does not have a construct analogous to a global element



Legg & Prager             Expires 19 June 2004                  [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT      XED: Schema Language Integration   December 19, 2003


   definition, hence there is no analogy in ASN.1 for referencing a
   global element definition (though there is in ASN.1 Schema).

   The AnyType ASN.1 type represents the content of an element.  To
   import an element from a non-ASN.1 specification it is necessary to
   regard that element as the child element of a notional type whose
   content model permits only the imported element.

   The notional type is arbitrarily chosen to be a choice type.

   The notional type does not have any attributes therefore the
   attributes component of a value of AnyType would normally be empty,
   or contain only namespace declaration attributes.

   The values of the AnyType ASN.1 type can be restricted to conform to
   a notional choice type containing a specific XML Schema element or
   RELAX NG element, or containing an element with the name and content
   specified by a nominated DTD element type declaration, by applying a
   UserDefinedConstraint containing the value of
   id-constraint-xml-element as a parameter.

      id-constraint-xml-element OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-constraint 1 }

   A UserDefinedConstraint in which an OBJECT IDENTIFIER with the value
   of id-constraint-xml-element is used MUST satisfy all of the
   following conditions:

   a) there SHALL be three or four UserDefinedConstraintParameters,

   b) the first UserDefinedConstraintParameter SHALL be a Value of the
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ASN.1 type and that Value SHALL be the same as
      id-constraint-xml-element,

   c) the second UserDefinedConstraintParameter SHALL be a Value of the
      AnyURI ASN.1 type (possibly an empty string),

   d) the third UserDefinedConstraintParameter SHALL be a Value of the
      NCName ASN.1 type,

   e) the fourth UserDefinedConstraintParameter, if present, SHALL be a
      Value of the AnyURI ASN.1 type,

   f) taken together the second and third UserDefinedConstraintParameter
      SHALL be the namespace name and local name [XMLNS] of either an
      XML Schema element definition, a RELAX NG element definition, or a
      DTD element type declaration.

   The fourth UserDefinedConstraintParameter is used when the namespace

   name and local name reference is ambiguous.  Its value is a URI that
   indicates the intended schema document, either an XML Schema
   specification, a RELAX NG specification, or a DTD.

   Example

      AnyType (CONSTRAINED BY {
                  OBJECT IDENTIFIER:
                      { iso(1) 2 36 79672281 xed(3) constraint(1) 1 },
                  AnyURI:"http://www.example.com/IPO",
                  NCName:"purchaseOrder" })

   The Contained-XML-Element and Contained-XML-Element-From-Schema
   parameterized types are defined so that XML Schema global elements,
   RELAX NG elements and DTD element type declarations can be more
   conveniently referenced.

      Contained-XML-Element
        { AnyURI:namespace, NCName:name } ::= AnyType
          (CONSTRAINED BY { OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id-constraint-xml-element,
              AnyURI:namespace, NCName:name })

      Contained-XML-Element-From-Schema { AnyURI:namespace, NCName:name,
              AnyURI:schemaIdentity } ::= AnyType
          (CONSTRAINED BY { OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id-constraint-xml-element,
              AnyURI:namespace, NCName:name, AnyURI:schemaIdentity })

   The Contained-XML-Element type cannot be used if the URI of a schema
   document is required to disambiguate the target namespace and name.

7.  Security Considerations

   Values of the AnyType type potentially hold the content of elements
   for which the Canonical XML [CXML] representation must be
   recoverable.  Such recovery is needed for the verification of digital
   signatures.  The rules governing the representation of the content of
   an element in an AnyType value are compatible with Canonical XML.
   Implementors must be careful not to introduce any further changes
   which would make it impossible to recover the Canonical XML
   representation.
