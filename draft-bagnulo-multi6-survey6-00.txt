1. Introduction

   This document presents proposed solutions and tools related to IPv6
   multi-homing.  All presented proposals respect actual IPv6 routing
   architecture and current ISP address aggregation scheme, in
   particular, avoiding route injection to the DFZ.  Besides, only
   network and transport level solutions are introduced, meaning that
   application level solutions are intentionally excluded.  The aim of
   this study is to provide a compilation of the proposed solutions to
   serve as an input to multi6 working group discussion.

2. Mechanisms description

2.1 IPv6 multi-homing with route aggregation

   The solution presented in "IPv6 multi-homing with route aggregation"
   [1] is intended to achieve the following objectives:

   o  Redundancy provision in case of connection failure, in order to
      guarantee that the multi-homed site remains on line even if there
      is only one connection working properly.

   o  Load sharing among available connections, so that both inbound and
      outbound traffic is balanced using the existing providers.

   o  Simple management.

   Solution mechanism:

   	     ______________________________
   	    |     Internet                 |
   	    |______________________________|
   	      |                          |
   	link1 |       link5              | link2
   	     ISPA--------------------- ISPB
   	       \                        /
   	  link3 \______________________/  link4
   	        |   Multi-homed site   |
   	        |   PrefA:Prefsite::/n |
   	        |______________________|

    In the topology depicted in the figure above, the multi-homed site
   is connected to the Internet through two different ISPs (ISPA and
   ISPB).  Besides, the considered site has obtained global addresses
   only from ISPA, which will be called primary ISP, so that the
   addresses contain PrefA (ISP based address aggregation is used).
   Note that in this solution, the multi-homed site needs only one
   global prefix.  The propagation of routing information would be as
   follows:

   o  The site propagates PrefA:Prefsite::/n to ISPA and ISPB through
      link3 and link4 respectively.

   o  ISPB propagates PrefA:Prefsite::/n to ISPA through link5.  Note
      that ISPB does NOT propagates routing information about
      PrefA:Prefsite::/n to the Internet.

   o  ISPA propagates PrefA::/nA to the Internet through link1.

   With the described routing configuration, inbound traffic (traffic
   from the Internet to the site) will be routed towards ISPA through
   link1.  Then ISPA performs load balancing through link3 and link5
   (and therefore in this case, also through ISPB and link4).  Outbound
   traffic (traffic from the site to the Internet) can be forwarded
   through ISPA (link3) or ISPB (link4) depending on the routing
   configuration of the site.  In the case of failure, connectivity
   would be granted on the following 	situations:

   o  If link3 fails, ISPA routes all traffic coming from the Internet
      towards the site through ISPB (link5 and then link4).  Outbound
      traffic generated on site is routed through link4 to ISPB.

   o  If link4 fails, ISPA does not route traffic to the site through
      ISPB (link5) so that all traffic is transmitted using link3.
      Traffic from the site to the Internet is exclusively routed
      through ISPA (link3).


   Mechanism evaluation

   Advantages


   o  Neither new protocol nor new mechanism are needed, facilitating
      deployment.

   o  Several global addresses per interface are no longer needed to
      obtain the benefits of the multi-homing architecture, which
      simplifies management on the site.

   o  Provides fault tolerance if one of the links (link3 or link4)
      connecting to the ISP fails.

   o  Preserves established TCP connections through link failure.

   o  Allows load sharing, provided that local policies are capable to
      define which exit link to use.


   Concerns


   o  Primary ISP is critical because its link to the Internet (link1)
      is the only used for inbound traffic.  The mechanisms does not
      provide fault tolerance neither in case of primary ISP failure nor
      for Primary ISP Internet link failure.  Another critical task that
      Primary ISP must implement is load sharing, deciding which link to

Internet-Draft      Survey on multi-homing mecanisms           July 2001


      use for inbound traffic.

   o  The tasks that the primary ISP must complete imply a more complex
      ISP administration.

   o  The mechanism is more efficient when a direct connection between
      ISPA and ISPB (link5) exists.  If there is no such connection,
      more routing information has to be propagated, intermediate ISPs
      are involved, and less effective aggregation is achieved.

   o  The mechanism requires coordination between ISPs, which may
      conflict with their commercial interests.  Moreover, additional
      commercial issues may arise from the fact that there are two
      different roles appear, primary ISP and the rest.

   o  Even though the mechanism allows load sharing, it does not provide
      any tool to perform ISP selection.  Since the outbound link
      depends on site policies and the inbound link is determined by
      primary ISP, it is difficult to provide a coherent path for both
      directions of a given connection.

   o  The mechanism to achieve load balance in the primary ISP for
      inbound traffic is not specified.


2.2 IPv6 multi-homing support at site exit routers.

   This mechanism is originally presented in "Scalable support for
   multi-homed multi-provider connectivity" [2] and further detail is
   given in "IPv6 multi-homing support at site exit routers" [3].  The
   intended goal of the mechanism is to maintain multi-homed site
   connectivity with the Internet even when some of the exit links are
   down.  [3] explicitly expresses that this mechanism is not intended
   to provide link selection nor load balancing.  Solution mechanism The
   solution is presented in the illustrated scenario:

   	     |PrefA:Prefsite      PrefB:Prefsite|
   	     |__________________________________|


    In the configuration above, the multi-homed site is connected to the
   Internet through 2 ISPs (ISPA and ISPB) using link1 and link2
   respectively.  Each of the ISP has delegated an address space to the
   site: ISPA has delegated PRefA:Prefsite::/nA+n and ISPB has delegated
   PrefB:Prefsite::/nB+n.  Besides, secondary links (link3 and link4)
   are established between the site and the ISPs.  Link3 bonds the site
   exit router connecting with ISPA (RA) with the border router of ISPB
   (BRB).  Link4 bonds the site exit router connecting with ISPB (RB)
   with the border router of ISPA (BRA).  Secondary links are usually
   implemented as IP over IP tunnels.  This tunnels may be built over
   existing physical links (link1 and link2) although the usage of
   additional physical links is recommended.  In normal conditions,
   secondary links are advertised by the routing protocol with a very
   low priority, so that primary links (link1 and link2) are used.  In
   case of failure, primary links are no longer advertised so secondary
   links become a valid option for the routers.

   Mechanism evaluation

   Advantages


   o  Provides fault tolerance for ISP connecting link failure.

   o  Preserves established TCP connections through link failure.

   o  There is no need for new protocols or mechanisms.


   Concerns


   o  Does not provide fault tolerance in case of ISP failure.

   o  Does not provide tools for ISP selection for load sharing.

Internet-Draft      Survey on multi-homing mecanisms           July 2001


   o  In case of long term failure, an additional mechanism is required
      for preventing the usage of the secondary link.  This implies some
      mechanism to stop the usage of crashed ISP addresses as source
      address of outbound packets.

   o  Implies more complex management due to the need of several global
      addresses per interface requiring the use of several ISPs.
      Another source of management complexity is the need of tunnel
      configuration.


2.3 Multi-homing with router renumbering

   This proposal is described in "Multihomed routing domain issues" [4].
   It basically consists of the usage of Router Renumbering [5] and
   Router Advertising protocols to deprecate addresses in case of ISP
   failure.

        |__________________________________|


    In the depicted topology the multi-homed site obtains Internet
   connectivity using two ISPs (ISPA and ISPB).  Each one of the ISPs
   has delegated an address space to the site, PrefA:Prefsite::/n and
   PrefB:Prefsite::/n respectively.  In normal conditions, any device in
   the site that need to obtain internet access through both ISPs needs

Internet-Draft      Survey on multi-homing mecanisms           July 2001


   one global address of each address space, so that every interface is
   configured with at least two global addresses.  Note that the inbound
   route is determined by the address used to refer to such device.  In
   case of failure, the mechanism works as follows: Suppose that ISPA
   crashes.  When an external host needs to communicate with any device
   of the site, it will query the DNS.  The DNS will provide at least
   two addresses, as we stated before.  If the ISPA delegated address
   (PrefA:Prefsite::host) is used, communication will fail, forcing the
   usage of the other address.  When an internal host needs to establish
   a communication with an external host, internal routing configuration
   will course the outbound packet towards the ISP which is working
   properly.  However if the packet source address belongs to ISPA
   address space, communication will not be established, because
   retuning packets will be routed towards the crashed ISP (ISPA).  So,
   to ensure connectivity it is imperative to avoid the usage of
   addresses delegated by the crashed ISP, ISPA in our example.  This
   can be achieved using the Router Advertising protocol and Router
   Renumbering protocol.  In our site, the exit router connecting with
   ISPA (RA) would detect the failure and immediately would send a
   router advertising in order to deprecate ISPA delegated addresses.
   It would also use the Router Renumbering protocol to propagate the
   information about deprecation to other routers, such as RC, so that
   this addresses will not be used in any new connection.

   Mechanism evaluation

   Advantages


   o  Provides stable configuration in case of long term ISP failure.
      Note that it provides ISP fault tolerance, not only link fault
      tolerance.

   o  There is no need for any new protocol or mechanism.

   Concerns

   o  It does not preserve established TCP connections.

   o  It does not provide tools for ISP selection for load sharing
      purposes.

   o  Several global addresses per interface are needed in order to
      seize multi-homing benefits, leading to management complexity.

   Observation: Multi-homing support at exit site routers and Multi-
   homing with router renumbering mechanisms can be used together in
   order to provide a more complete solution.  If both mechanisms are



Bagnulo, et. al.        Expires December 31, 2001               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      Survey on multi-homing mecanisms           July 2001


   used, short term failures can be managed using tunnels, while for
   long term failures the router renumbering mechanism is used.

2.4 Preserving active TCP sessions on Multi-homed networks.

   A completely different approach is introduced in "Preserving active
   TCP sessions on Multi-homed etworks." [6], which is based on the idea
   that most IPv6 interfaces will have several IP addresses assigned,
   specially in a multi-homed 	environment.  When a TCP connection is
   established, both ends of the connection should be identified by a
   set of addresses, instead of only one address as it is done today.
   In order to do that, when a TCP connection is established, each end
   identifies itself with a set of valid addresses.  The application to
   a multi-homing scenario would be as follows: Suppose that the multi-
   homed site has two ISP (ISPA and ISPB), and both of them have
   delegated an address space to the site, PrefA:Prefsite::/n and
   PrefB:Prefsite::/n respectively.  Any host in the site that intends
   to use both ISPs needs al least two global addresses,
   PrefA:Prefsite::host and PrefB:Prefsite::host.  When this host
   establishes a TCP connection with any other host in the Internet, it
   identifies itself with a set of addresses which is composed by
   PrefA:Prefsite::host and PrefB:Prefsite::host.  If any of the ISPs
   crashes, the connection can survive just using the address of the
   other ISP.  In the original approach, it is proposed that the valid
   set of addresses identifying a host in a TCP connection is exchanged
   during TCP three-way handshake, using TCP options.  Afterwards, in
   IPng working group Tokyo meeting in 1999 [7]  the usage of an IPv6
   destination option was proposed.  This overcomes the 40 bytes limit
   of TCP options.

   Mechanism evaluation

   Advantages


   o  Provides complete fault tolerance including preservation of active
      TCP connections, meaning that if there is an available path,
      connectivity is ensured.

   o  There is no need for changes in network devices, because it is a
      host-based solution.

   Concerns

   o  Introduces modifications in the protocol, IP or TCP.  Furthermore,
      in order to provide a working solution, changes are needed in both
      hosts involved in the connection, not only the host belonging to
      the multi-homed site.

Internet-Draft      Survey on multi-homing mecanisms           July 2001


   o  It does not provide any tool for load sharing or ISP selection.

   o  This mechanism could have impact on security issues, like
      connection hijacking, that must be considered on mechanism design.

   o  Basic solution is limited to TCP traffic only.


2.5 Mobility mechanisms

   Another proposal presented in "Multihomed routing domain issues" [4]
   is based in the use of IP mobility mechanisms.  The main idea is to
   use the care-of-address assignation mechanism to switch between
   delegated addresses in case of failure.  Suppose that there is an
   established communication between hostA belonging to the multi-homed
   site and hostB, somewhere in the Internet, as shown the figure below.

     ___________________________________________
    |                    Internet               |

        |ISPA|                        |ISPB|
        |BRA |                        |BRB |
        +----+                        +----+
           |                            |
     link1 |                            | link2
         __|____________________________|___
        |  RA                          RB   |
        |   |                           |   |
        |  -------------------------------  |
        |                 |                 |
        |               hostA               |
        |        PrefA:Prefsite:hostA       |
        |        PrefB:Prefsite:hostA       |
        |                                   |
        |___________________________________|


    The established connection is being routed through ISPA and
   PrefA:Prefsite:hostA is used.  If ISPA fails, the described steps are
   followed in order to preserve communication:

   o  HostA packets contain the home address destination option with
      PrefA:Prefsite:hostA and PrefB:Prefsite:hostA as source address,
      so that for every device on the path source address is



Bagnulo, et. al.        Expires December 31, 2001              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft      Survey on multi-homing mecanisms           July 2001


      PrefB:Prefsite:hostA and only hostB replaces this source address
      by PrefA:Prefsite:hostA.

   o  HostA sends a binding update containing  PrefB:Prefsite:hostA as a
      care-of address.  Note that that authentication header is needed
      in this packet.

   o  HostB sends a binding  acknowledgement.  This packet and all next
      packets are sent with PrefA:Prefsite:hostA as final destination
      (included in a routing header) and PrefB:Prefsite:hostA as next
      destination (included as destination address).  Consequently, all
      packets are sent towards HostA using ISPB, and address
      "translation" is done when packets reach HostA.


   Mechanism Evaluation:

   Advantages


   o  The mechanism provides complete fault tolerance.

   o  It uses existing protocols.

   o  It allows ISP selection for load sharing.

   Concerns

   o  Needs Mobile IP features on destination host.

   o  Mobile IP security mechanisms impose the use of authentication
      header,raising complexity.  In order to use the AH, a security
      association is needed in both hosts, which must be established
      before the failure.


2.6 Routing headers usage

   A mechanism intended to force routing through a specific ISP in
   multi-homed sites is suggested in RFC 2526 [9].  The main idea is  to
   include a routing header with an intermediate anycast address
   identifying selected ISP routers, in order to force the packet path
   through the chosen ISP.  Another approach for ISP selection is site
   exit router selection, instead of ISP router selection.  When
   different routers support ISP connections, exit router selection can
   be done using a Routing Header that includes a site-local address
   assigned to one of the router interfaces.  In the case that more than
   one exit router were connected to the same ISP, this address would be

   assigned to all the connecting routers, becoming an anycast address.
   If the packets are routed to a single exit router, ISP selection can
   be implemented locally in the border device.  Note that supporting
   both ISP connections on a single router introduces a single point of
   failure, which precludes the fault tolerance ability pursued in
   multi-homing architectures.  There are some differences between the
   two approaches, that wiil be presented next.  In the first case, the
   routing header was used to force a path including the ISP routers
   anycast address; as a consequence, processing of the routing header
   requires ISP routing resources.  In the second case, the processing
   of the routing header is done by the site exit router, which presents
   some benefits: Improved scalability: as one ISP connects many sites
   with the Internet,interpretation of routing headers could be a heavy
   task.  If it is done at site exit routers scalability is preserved.
   ISP independence: There is no need for ISP cooperation, such as
   support for the all routers anycast address in the ISP network.

   Mechanism evaluation

   Advantages


   o  It is the only proposed method to explicit ISP selection by hosts.
      This enables ISP selection mechanisms based on other criteria than
      link availability.

   o  This solution is based in existing protocols, so it is fast and
      easy to implement and deploy.

   o  This solution is implemented completely at network level granting
      performance.

   Concerns

   o  Overhead of routing headers.

   o  Some host modifications are needed in order to include the
      appropriate routing headers.

   o  Management of information, such as routers address could be high.


2.7 Routing support for IPv6 multi-homing

   A more specific multi-homing issue, related to the configuration
   shown in the figure below, is addressed in "Routing support for IPv6
   multi-homing" [8].

        |___________________________________|


    In the above configuration, the multi-homed site is connected to two
   ISPs.  Each one of the connecting ISP belongs to a different TLA
   (TLA1 and TLA2).  Each ISP delegates a site prefix:
   T1:N1:Prefsite::/16+n1+n and T2:N2:Prefsite::/16+n2+n.  Routing
   information is propagated as described in figure 5, so TLA1 border
   router (BRT1) propagates TLA1::/16 to NLA1 through link1, TLA2 border
   router (BRT2) propagates TLA2::/16 to NLA2 through link2, NLA1 border
   router (BRN1) propagates TLA1:NLA1::/16+n1 to the site through link3,
   NLA2 border router (BRN2) propagates TLA2:NLA2:/16+n2 to the site
   through link4.  Suppose that link1 fails.  This has no relevant
   impact in inbound traffic, because after trying without success with
   T1:N1:Prefsite::host address, external hosts will try with
   T2:N2:Prefsite::host and connection will be established.  The main
   problem appears when an internal host initiates a connection with an
   external host.  If the internal host uses T1:N1:Prefsite::host as
   source address, returning packets of this connection have no
   available inbound path.  In order to avoid the presented behaviour,
   the idea is to propagate TLA reachability information besides NLA
   reachability information through link3 and link4.  In this case and

   in normal conditions, NLA1 border router (BRN1) propagates
   TLA1:NLA1::/16+n1 and TLA1::/16 to the site through link3, NLA2
   border router (BRN2) propagates TLA2:NLA2:/16+n2 and TLA2::/16 to the
   site through link4.  If link1 fails, NLA1 border router (BRN1) only
   propagates TLA1:NLA1::/16+n1 to the site through link3, so internal
   routers know that the Internet is not	reachable through NLA1.  This
   information can be used by the source address selection algorithm of
   the internal host to avoid the usage of those addresses as source
   address.
