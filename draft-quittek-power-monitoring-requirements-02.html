Introduction</h3>

<p>With rising energy cost and with an increasing awareness of the
      ecological impact of running IT and networking equipment, energy
      management is becoming an additional basic requirement for network 
      management frameworks and systems.
</p>
<p>Different to other typical network management functions, energy
      management often extends its scope beyond devices with IP network 
      interfaces. Requirements in this document do not fully cover 
      all these networks, but they cover means for opening IP network 
      management towards them.
</p>
<p>In general, IETF Standards for energy management should be defined 
      in such a way that they can be applied to several areas including
  	  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Communication networks and IT systems
</li>
<li>Building networks
</li>
<li>Home networks
</li>
<li>Smart (power) grids
</li>
</ul>

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Energy management functions</h3>

<p>The basic objective of energy management is operating communication 
      networks and other equipment with a minimal amount of energy. An energy 
      management system should provide means for reducing the power consumption
      of individual components of a network as well as of the whole network.
</p>
<p>One approach to achieve this goal is setting all components to an 
      operational state that results in lower energy consumption but still 
      meets service level performance objectives. The sufficient performance 
      level may vary over time and can depend on several factors. 
      In principle, there are four basic types of power states for a 
      component or for a whole system:
      </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>full power state
</li>
<li>reduced power states (lower clock rate for processor, lower
        data rate on a link, etc.)
</li>
<li>stand-by/sleep state (not functional, but immediately available)
</li>
<li>power-off state (requiring significant time for becoming
        operational)
</li>
</ul><p>
      In actual implementations the number of power 
      states and their properties vary a lot. Very simple devices may just
      have a full power and a power off state, while other devices may 
      have a high number of different reduced power and sleep states.
</p>
<p>While the general objective of energy management is quite clear, 
      the way to attain that goal is often difficult. In many cases there 
      is no way of reducing power consumption without the consequence of 
      a potential performance degradation. Then a trade-off needs to be 
      dealt with between service level objectives and energy efficiency. 
      In other cases a reduction 
      of energy consumption can easily be achieved while still maintaining 
      sufficient service level performance, for example, by switching 
      components to lower power states when higher performance is not needed.
      
</p>
<p>Network management systems can control such situations by implementing
      policies to achieve a certain degree of energy efficiency.  In order to
      make policy decisions properly, information about the energy consumption 
      of network components and sub-components in different power states is 
      required. Often this information is acquired best through monitoring.
</p>
<p>Monitoring operational power states and energy consumption is also 
      useful for other energy management purposes including but not limited to
      </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>investigating power saving potential
</li>
<li>evaluating the effectiveness of energy saving policies and
        measures
</li>
<li>deriving, implementing, and testing power management
        strategies
</li>
<li>accounting the total power consumption of a network element, 
        a network, a service, or subcomponents of those
</li>
</ul>

<p>From the considerations described above the following basic 
      management functions appear to be required for energy management: 
      </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>monitoring power states of network elements and their 
           subcomponents
</li>
<li>monitoring actual power (energy consumption rate) of network 
           elements and their subcomponents
</li>
<li>monitoring (accumulated) energy consumption of network 
           elements and their subcomponents
</li>
<li>setting power states of network elements and their subcomponents
</li>
<li>setting and enforcing power saving policies
</li>
</ul>

<p>Editorial note: With the extension to power state control and
      policy enforcement, the title of the draft does not anymore match
      the scope well. The name of the draft will be updated in a future
      revision.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that monitoring energy consumption and power
      states itself is obviously not in itself a means to reduce the energy
      consumption of a device. In fact, it is likely to increase the power 
      consumption of a device slightly. However, the acquired energy 
      consumption and power state information is essential fordefining 
      energy saving policies and can be used as input to power state 
      control loops that in total can lead to energy savings.
</p>
<p>It should further be noted that active power control is complementary
      (but essential) to other energy savings measures such as low power
      electronics, energy saving protocols (e.g. IEEE 802.3az), and
      energy-efficient device design (for example, stand-by and low-power
      modes for individual components of a device), and energy-efficient 
      network architectures. Measurement of energy consumption may also provide
      input for developing these technologies.

<a name="rfc.section.1.2"></a><h3>1.2.&nbsp;
Specific aspects of energy management</h3>

<p>There are two aspects of energy management that make it different 
      from other common network management functions. The first difference 
      is that energy consumption is often measured remotely to the device 
      under consideration.
      A reason for this is that today very few devices are instrumented with
      the hardware and software for measuring their own current power and 
      accumulated energy consumption. Often power and energy for such devices 
      is measured by other devices.
</p>
<p>A common example is a Power over Ethernet (PoE) sourcing device 
      that provides means for measuring provided power per port. 
      If the device connected to a port is known, power and energy 
      measurements for that device can be conducted by the PoE sourcing 
      device. Another example is a smart power strip. Again, if it is known 
      which devices are plugged into which outlets of the smart power strip, 
      then the power strip can provide measured values for these devices.
</p>
<p>The second difference is that often it is desirable to apply 
      energy management also 
      to networks and devices that do not communicate via IP, for example, in
      building networks where besides IP several other communication protocols 
      are used. In these networks, it may be desirable that devices with IP
      interfaces report energy and power values for other devices. Reports 
      may be based on measurements at the reporting device, similar to the
      PoE sourcing device and the smart strip. But reports may also be just
      relayed from non-IP communication to IP communication.

          fundamental (basic first step) requirement. The devices listed 
          in this scenario are some of the components of a communication 
          network. For these network devices, the chassis draws power 
          from an outlet and feeds all its internal sub-components.

Scenario 2: PoE sourcing equipment and PoE powered devices</h3>

<p>This scenario covers devices using Power over Ethernet (PoE).
          A PoE Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE), for example, a PoE switch, 
          provices power to a PoW Powered Device (PD), for example, a PoE 
          desktop phone. Here, the PSE provides means for controlling power 
          supply (switching it on and off) and for monitoring actual power 
          provided at a port to a specific PD.

Scenario 3: Power probes and Smart meters</h3>

<p>Today, very few devices are equipped with sufficient 
          instrumentation to measure their own actual power and accumulated
          energy consumption. Often external probes are connected to the
          power supply for measuring these properties for a single device 
          or for a set of devices.
</p>
<p>Homes, buildings, and data centers have smart meters that 
          monitor and report accumulated power consumption of an entire home, 
          a set of offices or a set of devices in data centers.
</p>
<p>Power Distribution Unit (PDUs) attached to racks in data center 
          and other smart power strips are evolving with smart meters 
          and remote controllable power switches embedded for each socket.

          a set of associated devices. For example, a switch can provide

          even if these devices are not PoE PDs, but have their own power 
          supply as, for example, PCs connected to the switch.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Granularity of monitoring and control</h3>

<p>Often it is desirable to switch off individual components of a device
        but not the entire device. The switch may need to continue serving a few
        ports (for example, the ports serving an email server or needed for
        server backup), but most other ports could be entirely switched off
        under some policies (for example at night or the weekend in an office).
</p>
<p>As illustrated by this example, it is often desirable to monitor
        power state and energy consumption on a granularity level that is finer
        than just the device level. Monitoring should be available for
        individual components of devices, such as line cards, processor cards,
        hard drives, etc.  For example, for IP routers the following list of
        views of a router gives an idea of components that potentially 
        could be monitored and controlled individually:
        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Physical view: chassis (or stack), central control engine, line
          cards, service cards, etc. 
</li>
<li>Component view: CPU, ASICs, fans, power supply, ports (single ports
          and port groups), storage and memory
</li>
<li>Feature view: L2 forwarding, L3 routing, security features, load
          balancing features, network management, etc.
</li>
<li>Logical view: system, data-plane, control-plane, etc.
</li>
<li>Relationship view: line cards, ports and the correlation between
          transmission speed and power consumption, relationship of system load
          and total power consumption
</li>
</ul>

<p>Instrumentation for measuring energy consumption of a
        device is typically more expensive than instrumentation for
        retrieving the devices power state. It may be a reasonable compromise
        in many cases to provide power state information for all individually
        switchable components of a device separately, while the energy
        consumption is only measured for the entire device.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Remote and Aggregated Monitoring</h3>

<p>There are several ways power and energy consumption can be
        measured and reported. Measurements can be performed locally at 
        the device that consumes energy or remotely by a device that has 
        access to the power supply of another device.
</p>
<p>Instrumentation for power and energy measurements at a device 
        requires additional hardware. 
        A cost-efficient alternative is measuring power and energy 
        consumption aggregated for a set of devices, for example a PoE 
        PSE reporting these values per port group instead of per port, 
        or a power distribution unit that reports the values for all 
        connected devices instead of per socket.
</p>
<p>If aggregated measurement is conducted, it is obvious that 
        reporting provides aggregated values. but aggregated reporting can
        also be combined with local measurements. A managed node may act as 
        mid-level manager or protocol converter for several devices that 
        measure power consumption by themselves, for example a home gateway
        or a gateway to building networks. In this case, the reporting node
        may choose to report for each device individual values or aggregated
        values from groups of devices that transmitted their power and 
        energy consumption values to the reporting node.
</p>
<p>Often it is sufficient and more cost efficient having a single device
        measuring and providing power state and energy consumption information
        not just for itself but also for several further devices that are in
        some way attached to it. If the measuring and reporting device has
        access to individual power supply lines for each device, then it can
        measure energy consumption per device. If it only has access to a joint
        power supply for several devices, then it will measure aggregated
        values. 
</p>
<p>One example for the first case is a switch acting as power sourcing
        equipment for several IP phones using Power over Ethernet (PoE). The
        switch can measure the power consumption for each phone individually 
        at the port the phone is connected to or it measures aggregated values 
        per port group for a set of devices.. The phones do not need to provide
        means for energy consumption measurement and reporting by themselves.
        
</p>
<p>Another example is a smart meter that just measures and reports the
        energy transmitted through attached electric cables. Such a smart meter
        can be used to monitor energy consumption of an individual device if
        connected to the devices' individual power supply. But in many common
        cases it measures the aggregated energy consumption of several devices,
        for example, as part of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) that
        serves several devices at a single power cord, or as a smart electric
        meter for a set of machines in a rack, in an office building or at a
        residence.

<p>Depending on how power and energy consumption values are obtained

Power State Monitoring</h3>

<p>The power state of a device or component typically can only have a
          small number of discrete values such as, for example, full power, low
          power, standby, hibernating, off. However, some of these states may
          have one or more sub-states or state parameters. For example, in low
          power state, a reduced clock rate may be set to a large number of
          different values. For the device power state, the following
          information is considered to be relevant:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the current state - the time of the last change
</li>
<li>the cause for the last transition
</li>
<li>time to transit from one stage to another
</li>
<li>the total time spent in each state
</li>
<li>the duration of the last period spent in each state
</li>
<li>the number of transitions to each state
</li>
<li>the current power source
</li>
</ul>

<p>For some network management tasks it may be desirable to receive
          notifications from devices when components or the entire device
          change their power state.

Energy Consumption Monitoring</h3>

<p>Independent of the power state, energy consumption of a device or a
          device's component is a quantity for which the value may change
          continuously. Therefore, the information that needs to be retrieved
          concerning this quantity is quite different:
          </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the current real power (energy consumption rate) averaged
              over a short time interval
</li>
<li>total energy consumption
</li>
<li>energy consumption since the last report or for the last
              configured time interval
</li>
<li>total energy consumption per power state
</li>
<li>energy consumption per power state since the last report
</li>
</ul><p>
          For some network management tasks it may be desirable to
          receive notifications from devices when the current power
          consumption of a component or of the entire device exceeds or falls
          below certain thresholds.
</p>
<p>Energy consumption of a device or a device's component 
          is a quantity for which the value may change continuously.  
          For some network management tasks it is required to measure the
          power over time with a relatively high time resolution. In such a
          case not just single values for the current power of a component is
          needed, but a series of power values reporting on consecutive time
          intervals.
</p>
<p>In order to put measured data into perspective, the precision of
          the measured data, i.e. the potential error in the measured data,
          needs to be known as well.

Battery State Monitoring</h3>

<p>An increasing number of networked devices are expected to be

          meter readings and are installed in places where external power
          supply is not always possible or costly. But also other devices
          might have internal/external batteries to power devices for short
          periods of time when the main power fails, to power parts of the device
          when the main device is switches off etc. Knowing the state of these 
          batteries is important for the operation of these devices and includes 
          information such as:
					</p>
<ul class="text">

Monitoring Models</h3>

<p>Monitoring of power states and energy consumption can be performed in
      pull mode (for example, SNMP GET <a class='info' href='#RFC3410'>[RFC3410]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Case, J., Mundy, R., Partain, D., and B. Stewart, &ldquo;Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet-Standard Management Framework,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>) or in push mode
      (for example SNMP notification <a class='info' href='#RFC3410'>[RFC3410]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Case, J., Mundy, R., Partain, D., and B. Stewart, &ldquo;Introduction and Applicability Statements for Internet-Standard Management Framework,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, Syslog <a class='info' href='#RFC5424'>[RFC5424]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gerhards, R., &ldquo;The Syslog Protocol,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, or IPFIX <a class='info' href='#RFC5101'>[RFC5101]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Claise, B., &ldquo;Specification of the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) Protocol for the Exchange of IP Traffic Flow Information,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>).
</p>
<p>Pull mode monitoring is often easier to handle for a network management
      systems, because it can determine when it gets certain information from
      a certain device. However, the overhead of pull model monitoring is
      typically higher than for push model monitoring, particularly when large
      numbers of values are to be collected, such as time series of power
      values.
</p>
<p>In such cases, push model monitoring may be preferable with a device
      sending a data stream of values without explicit request for each value
      from the network management system. For notifications on events, only the
      push model is considered to be appropriate.
</p>
<p>Applying these considerations to the required information leads to the
      conclusion that most of the information can appropriately be reported
      using the pull model. The only exceptions are notifications on power state
      changes and high volume time series of energy consumption values.

Control Requirements</h3>

<p>To realize the envisioned benefits of energy savings, 
      just monitoring power states and energy consumption would not be 
      sufficient. Energy efficiency can be realized only by setting the 
      network entities or components to energy saving power states when
      appropriate.
</p>
<p>With means for power state control, energy saving policies and
      control loops can be realized. Policies may, for example, define
      different power state settings based on the time-of-day. Control 
      loops may, for example, change power states based on actual 
      network load.
</p>
<p>Trivially, all entities being subject of energy management
      should have at least two power states, such as "on" and "off"
      or "on" and "sleep" to be set. 
      In many cases, it may be desirable to have more operational
      ("on" mode") and non-operational ("off"/"sleep" mode) power states.
      This applies particularly to devices with a lot of configuration 
      parameters that influence their energy consumption. Examples for
      specifications of power states of managed devices can be found in

ENTITY SENSOR MIB</h3>

<p><a class='info' href='#RFC3433'>RFC 3433<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bierman, A., Romascanu, D., and K. Norseth, &ldquo;Entity Sensor Management Information Base,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3433] defines the ENTITY SENSOR
          MIB module. Implementations of this module offer a generic way to
          provide data collected by a sensor. A sensor could be an energy
          consumption meter delivering measured values in Watt. This could be
          used for reporting current power of a device and its components. 
          Furthermore, the ENTITY SENSOR MIB can be used to retrieve the 
          precision of the used power meter.
</p>
<p>Similar to the ENTITY STATE MIB module, the ENTITY SENSOR MIB
          module makes use of the means provided by the <a class='info' href='#RFC4133'>ENTITY MIB module<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bierman, A. and K. McCloghrie, &ldquo;Entity MIB (Version 3),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC4133] for relating provided
          information to components of a device. 
</p>
<p>However, there is no unit available for reporting energy
          quantities, such as, for example, watt seconds or kilowatt hours,
          and the ENTITY SENSOR MIB module does not support reporting 
          accuracy of measurements according to the IEC / ANSI accuracy
          classes, which are commonly in use for electric power and energy
          measurements. The ENTITY SENSOR MIB modules only provides a 
          coarse-grained method for indicating accuracy by stating the 
          number of correct digits of fixed point values.

          module. Implementations of this module provide information on the
          current real power of devices attached to an uninterruptible power
          supply (UPS) device. This application would require identifying
          which device is attached to which port of the UPS device.
</p>
<p>UPS MIB provides information on the state of the UPS network.  
          The MIB module contains several variables identify the UPS 
          entity (name, model,..), the battery state, to characterize 
          the input load to the UPS, to characterize the output from 
          the UPS, to indicate the various alarm events.  The 
          measurements of power in UPS MIB are in Volts, Amperes and Watts.
          The units of power measurement are RMS volts, RMS Amperes and 
          are not based on Entity-Sensor MIB [RFC3433].

POWER ETHERNET MIB</h3>

<p>Similar to the UPS MIB, implementations of the POWER ETHERNET MIB
          module defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC3621'>RFC3621<span> (</span><span class='info'>Berger, A. and D. Romascanu, &ldquo;Power Ethernet MIB,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3621] provide

          required to identify which devices are attached to which port 
          of the power sourcing equipment.
</p>
<p>The  POWER ETHERNET MIB does not report power and energy 
          consumption on a per port basis, but can report aggregated values 
          for groups of ports. It does not use objects of the ENTITY MIB 
          module for identifying entities, although this module existed 
          already when the POWER ETHERNET MIB modules was standardized.

LLDP MED MIB</h3>

<p>The Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) defined in IEEE

          for advertising of their identities, capabilities, and 
          interconnections on a LAN network.  
              
          The Media Endpoint Discovery (MED) (ANSI/TIA-1057) is an enhancement 
          of LLDP known as LLDP-MED. The LLDP-MED enhancements specifically 
          address voice applications.  LLDP-MED covers 6 basic areas: 
          capabilities discovery, LAN speed and duplex discovery, 
          network policy discovery, location identification discovery, 
          inventory discovery, and power discovery.

<p>The power state management profile is used to describe and to 
          manage the power state of computer systems. This includes e.g. means
          to change the power state of a device (e.g. to shutdown the device)

Suggested Actions</h3>

<p>Based on the analysis of requirements in  <a class='info' href='#requirements'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Monitoring Requirements</span><span>)</span></a> and the discussion of monitoring models in 
      <a class='info' href='#models'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Monitoring Models</span><span>)</span></a> this memo proposes to develop a standard for
      pull-based monitoring of power states, energy consumption, and battery
      states. The analysis of existing 
      MIB modules in the previous section shows that they are not sufficient 
      to meet the requirements discussed in <a class='info' href='#requirements'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Monitoring Requirements</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>As a consequence, it suggested to develop one or more MIB modules 
      for this purpose. Such MIB modules could also cover push-based reporting 
      of power state changes using SNMP notifications. The only aspect that 
      would not be covered well by a MIB/SNMP solution is the
      reporting of large time series of energy consumption values. For this
      purpose SNMP does not appear to be an optimal choice. Particularly for
      supporting smart meter functionality, a push-based protocol appears to be
      more appropriate. Within the IP protocol family the Syslog and IPFIX
      protocols seem to be the most suitable candidates. There are more standard
      protocols with the capability to transfer measurement series, for example,
      DIAMETER, but these protocols are designed and well suited for other
      application areas than network monitoring.
</p>
<p>Comparing the two candidates (Syslog and IPFIX), IPFIX seems to be the
      better suited one. While Syslog is optimized for the transmission of text
      messages, IPFIX is better equipped for transmitting sequences of numerical
      values. Encoding numerical values into syslog is well feasible, see, for
      example, the mapping of SNMP notifications to Syslog messages in <a class='info' href='#RFC5675'>[RFC5675]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Marinov, V. and J. Schoenwaelder, &ldquo;Mapping Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Notifications to SYSLOG Messages,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, but IPFIX provides better means.
      With the extensible IPFIX information model <a class='info' href='#RFC5102'>[RFC5102]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Quittek, J., Bryant, S., Claise, B., Aitken, P., and J. Meyer, &ldquo;Information Model for IP Flow Information Export,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> no
      protocol extension would be required for transmitting energy consumption
      information. Only a set of new information elements would need to be
      registered at IANA. However, this memo suggests that the definition of such
      information elements should be conducted within the IETF and they should
      be documented in a standards track RFC.
