2.  Notation Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",  "SHALL  NOT",
   "SHOULD",  "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   Here are some definitions that may aid readers  that  are  unfamiliar
   with  either  SLP,  or  FCIP.   Some  of  these definitions have been
   reproduced from [RFC2608] and [RFC3105].

   User Agent (UA)            A process working on the  client's  behalf
                              to  establish  contact  with some service.
                              The UA retrieves service information  from
                              the Service Agents or Directory Agents.

   Service Agent (SA)         A process working on behalf of one or more
                              services to  advertise  the  services  and
                              their capabilites.

   Directory Agent (DA)       A    process    which   collects   service
                              advertisements.  There can only be one  DA
                              present per given host.

   Scope                      A  named set of services, typically making
                              up a logical administrative group.

   Service Advertisement      A  URL,   attributes,   and   a   lifetime
                              (indicating  how long the advertisement is
                              valid),    providing    service     access
                              information  and  capabilities description
                              for a particular service.

   FCIP Entity                The principle FCIP interface point to  the
                              IP network.

   FCIP Entity Name           The  world  wide name of the switch if the
                              FCIP Entity resides in  a  switch  or  the
                              world  wide  node  name  of the associated
                              Nx_Port.

   FCIP Discovery Domain      The FCIP Discovery Domain specifies  which
                              FCIP Entities are allowed to discover each
                              other within the bounds of the scope.

4.  Using SLPv2 for FCIP Service Discovery

   At least two FCIP Entities must be involved in the  entity  discovery
   process.   The end result is that an FCIP Entity will discover one or
   more peer FCIP Entities.


4.1.  Discovering FCIP Entities using SLPv2

   The following diagram shows the relationship  between  FCIP  Entities
   and their associated SLPv2 agents.

   Fig. 1 FCIP Entity and SLPv2 Agent Relationship.

   As  indicated in the drawing above, each FCIP Entity contains an FCIP
   Control and Services Module that interfaces to an SLPv2 SA and UA.

   The   SA   constructs   a   service   advertisement   of   the   type



Peterson                     Standards Track                    [Page 3]


Internet-Draft     Finding FCIP Entities Using SLPv2        January 2004


   "service:fcip:entity"  for  each  of  the  service  URLs it wishes to
   register. The service advertisement contains a lifetime,  along  with
   other attributes defined in the service template.

   The  remainder  of the discovery process is identical to that used by
   any client/server pair implementing SLPv2:

   1. If an SLPv2 DA is found [RFC2608], the  SA  contacts  the  DA  and
   registers the service advertisement. Whether or not one or more SLPv2
   DAs are discovered, the SA maintains the service advertisement itself
   and answers multicast UA queries directly.

   2.  When the FCIP Entity requires contact information for a peer FCIP
   Entity, the UA either contacts the DA using unicast or the  SA  using
   multicast  using  an  SLPv2  service request.  The UA service request
   includes  a  query,  based  on  the  attributes,  to   indicate   the
   characteristics of the peer FCIP Entities it requires.

   3.  Once  the  UA  has  the IP address and port number of a peer FCIP
   Entity, it may begin the normal connection procedure, as described in
   [FCIP], to a peer FCIP Entity.

   The  use  of  a  DA  is  RECOMMENDED  for  SLPv2 operation in an FCIP
   environment.


4.1.1.  FCIP Discovery Domains

   The concept of a discovery domain  provides  further  granularity  of
   control  of allowed discovery between FCIP Entities within a specific
   SLPv2 scope.

   The following example diagram shows  the  relationship  between  FCIP
   Entities  and  their  associated discovery domains within a specified
   SLPv2 scope.

   Fig. 2 FCIP Entity and Discovery Domain Example.

   Within the specified scope "fcip", the administrator  has  defined  a
   discovery  domain  "purple",  allowing  FCIP  Entities A, B, and C to
   discover each other.  This discovery domain is illustrated using  the
   "*" character.

   Within  the  specified  scope "fcip", the administrator has defined a
   discovery domain "orange", allowing FCIP Entity A  to  discover  FCIP
   Entity   B,  but  not  FCIP  Entity  C.   This  discovery  domain  is
   illustrated using the "#" character.

   Within the specified scope "fcip", the administrator  has  defined  a
   discovery  domain  "blue",  allowing  FCIP  Entity C to discover FCIP
   Entity  B,  but  not  FCIP  Entity  A.   This  discovery  domain   is
   illustrated using the "/" character.

   For  this  example,  the value of the fcip-discovery-domain attribute
   for each FCIP Entity is as follows:

   FCIP Entity A = orange,purple

   FCIP Entity B = orange,blue,purple

   FCIP Entity C = blue,purple

4.2.  NAT and NAPT Considerations

   Since SLPv2 provides IP address and TCP port information  within  its
   payload,  the  addresses an SA or DA advertise may not be the same as
   those  a  UA  must  use  if  a  Network  Address(/Port)   Translation
   (NAT/NAPT)  device  is  present  between the UA and the SA.  This may
   result in the UA discovering address information  that  is  unusable.
   Below are a few recommendations to handle this:


   - A  fully-qualified  domain name (i.e., not an IP address) SHOULD be
     used in service URLs and mgmt-entity attribute.

   - Use the default IANA-assigned FCIP TCP port number in service URLs,
     when possible.

   - If  advertising  service URLs through a translating device (e.g., a
     NAT/NAPT device), and the FQDN, IP address, or  TCP  port  will  be
     translated,  the  translating  device  can  provide  an SLPv2 proxy
     capability to do the translation.


5.  FCIP SLPv2 Templates

   Two templates are provided: an FCIP Entity template, and an  abstract
   template  to  provide  a means to add other FCIP related templates in
   the future.


5.1.  The FCIP Abstract Service Type Template

   This template defines the abstract service "service:fcip". It is used
   as  a  top-level  service  to  encapsulate  all  other  FCIP  related
   services.

     protocol.

   template-url-syntax =
     url-path=  ; Depends on the concrete service type.

   --------------------------template ends here------------------------


5.2.  The FCIP Entity Concrete Service Type Template

   This template defines the  service  "service:fcip:entity".  A  device
   containing  FCIP  Entities  that  wishes  to have them discovered via
   SLPv2 would register each of them, with each of their  addresses,  as
   this service type.

   FCIP  Entities wishing to discover other FCIP Entities in this manner
   will generally use one of the following example query strings:

   1. Find a specific FCIP Entity, given its FCIP Entity Name:

     Service:  service:fcip:entity
     Scope:    fcip-entity-scope-list
     Query:    (fcip-entity-name=\ff\10\00\00\60\69\20\34\0C)

   2. Find all of the FCIP Entities within a
      specified FCIP Discovery Domain:

     Service:  service:fcip:entity
     Scope:    fcip-entity-scope-list
     Query:    (fcip-discovery-domain=fcip-discovery-domain-name)

   3. In addition, a management application may wish to discover
      all FCIP Entities:

     Service:  service:fcip:entity
     Scope:    management-service-scope-list
     Query:    none

     - the FCIP Discovery Domain Name for which addresses are requested
     - the service URL

6.  Security Considerations

   The SLPv2 security model as specified in [RFC2608] does  not  provide
   confidentiality, but does provide an authentication mechanism for UAs
   to assure that service advertisements only come from trusted SAs with
   the  exception  that  it does not provide a mechanism to authenticate
   "zero-result responses". See [IPS-SEC] for a discussion of the  SLPv2
   [RFC2608] security model.

   Once  an  FCIP Entity is discovered, authentication and authorization
   are handled by the FCIP protocol. It is  the  responsibility  of  the
   providers  of  these  services  to  ensure  that  an  inappropriately
   advertised or discovered service does not comprimise their  security.

   When  no  security is used for SLPv2, there is a risk of distribution
   of false discovery information. The primary countermeasure  for  this
   risk  is  authentication.  When  this  risk is a significant concern,
   IPsec SAs SHOULD be used for FCIP traffic subject  to  this  risk  to
   ensure  that  FCIP  traffic  only  flows  between endpoints that have
   participated in IKE  authentication.  For  example,  if  an  attacker
   distributes discovery information falsely claiming that it is an FCIP
   endpoint,  it  will  lack  the  secret   information   necessary   to
   successfully complete IKE authentication, and hence will be prevented
   from falsely sending or receiving FCIP traffic.

   There remains a risk of a denial of service attack based on  repeated
   use  of false discovery information that will cause initiation of IKE
   negotiation.  The  countermeasures  for   this   are   administrative
   configuration  of  each  FCIP  Entity  to  limit the peers that it is
   willing to communicate with (i.e., by IP  address  range  and/or  DNS
   domain),  and maintenance of a negative authentication cache to avoid
   repeatedly contacting an FCIP  Entity  that  fails  to  authenticate.
   These  three  measures  (i.e.,  IP  address  range limits, DNS domain
   limits, negative authentication cache) MUST be implemented.

Internet-Draft     Finding FCIP Entities Using SLPv2        January 2004


6.1.  Security Implementation

   Security for SLPv2 in an IP storage environment is specified in [IPS-
   SEC].

   IPsec SHOULD be implemented for SLPv2 as specified in [IPS-SEC]. This
   includes ESP with a non-null transform to provide both authentication
   and confidentiality.

   SLPv2  authentication  is  OPTIONAL  to  implement and use, and SLPv2
   authentication SHOULD be implemented when IPsec is not supported.


7.  IANA Considerations

   After  RFC  publication,  an  SLP  designated  expert  will   oversee
   registration of the template(s) in the IANA repository.


8.  Internationalization Considerations

   SLP  allows internationalized strings to be registered and retrieved.
   Attributes in the template that are not marked with an 'L'  (literal)
   will   be  registered  in  a  localized  manner.  An  "en"  (English)
   localization MUST be registered, and others MAY be registered.

9.  Summary

   This document describes how SLPv2 can be used  by  FCIP  Entities  to
   find  other  FCIP  Entities. Service type templates for FCIP Entities
   are presented.
