   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   This document describes traffic engineering features of the Locator/
   Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP), which provides a set of
   functions for routers to exchange information used to map from non
   globally routable Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) to routable Routing
   Locators (RLOCs).  The LISP protocol also defines a mechanism for
   LISP routers to encapsulate IP packets addressed with EIDs for
   transmission across the Internet that uses RLOCs for routing and
   forwarding.

   When LISP routers encapsulate packets to other LISP routers, the path
   stretch is typically 1, meaning the packet travels on a direct path
   from the encapsulating ITR to the decapsulating ETR at the
   destination site.  The direct underlay path is determined by the
   underlying routing protocol and metrics it uses to find the shortest
   path.

   This specification will examine how reencapsulating tunnels [RFC6830]
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-te] can be used so a packet can take an

   administratively specified path, a congestion avoidance path, a
   failure recovery path, or multiple load-shared paths, as it travels
   from ITR to ETR.  By using an Explicit Locator Path (ELP) encoding
   [RFC8060] and the use of ELP-probing described in this document, an
   ITR can encapsulate a packet on a pre-determined path to a
   Reencapsulating Tunnel Router (RTR) which decapsulates the packet,
   then encapsulates it to the next locator in the ELP path.

3.  Definition of Terms

   Reencapsulating Tunnel Router (RTR):   An RTR is a router that acts
      as an ETR (or PETR) by decapsulating packets where the destination
      address in the "outer" IP header is one of its own RLOCs.  Then
      acts as an ITR (or PITR) by making a decision where to encapsulate
      the packet based on the next locator in the ELP towards the final
      destination ETR.  In this document, an RTR and ELP-node are terms
      used interchangeably.

   Explicit Locator Path (ELP):   The ELP is an explicit list of RLOCs
      for each RTR a packet must travel to along its path toward a final
      destination ETR (or PETR).  The list is a strict ordering where
      each RLOC in the list is visited.  However, the path from one RTR
      to another is determined by the underlying routing protocol and
      how the infrastructure assigns metrics and policies for the path.

   Recursive Tunneling:   Recursive tunneling occurs when a packet has
      more than one LISP IP header.  Additional layers of tunneling MAY
      be employed to implement traffic engineering or other re-routing
      as needed.  When this is done, an additional "outer" LISP header
      is added and the original RLOCs are preserved in the "inner"
      header.  Any references to tunnels in this specification refers to
      dynamic encapsulating tunnels and they are never statically
      configured.

   Reencapsulating Tunnels:   Reencapsulating tunneling occurs when an
      ETR removes a LISP header, then acts as an ITR to prepend another
      LISP header.  Doing this allows a packet to be re-routed by the
      reencapsulating router without adding the overhead of additional
      tunnel headers.  Any references to tunnels in this specification
      refers to dynamic encapsulating tunnels and they are never
      statically configured.  When using multiple mapping database
      systems, care must be taken to not create reencapsulation loops
      through misconfiguration.

   RLOC-Probing:   An RLOC-probe request is a Map-Request with the
      probe-bit set that is sent from an encapsulator (an ITR, PITR, or
      RTR) to a decapsulator (an ETR, PETR, RTR) to test for
      reachability among other functions.  A RLOC-probe reply is a Map-

      Reply with the probe-bit set that responds to the ITR-RLOC field
      of the Map-Request.  RLOC-probes are sent between RTRs listed in
      an ELP list.

   ELP-Probing:   Is an RLOC-probe that is encapsulated as a LISP data
      packet sent along the ELP path.  Each ELP node of of an ELP path
      adds telemetry information to the ELP-probe message that has been
      gathered from RLOC-probing.

4.  Overview

   LISP-TE functionality [I-D.ietf-lisp-te] describes how
   reencapsualting LISP routers can be used to traffic engineer a
   network.  By using an overlay approach, much of the underlay topology
   can be traversed with no special consideration or modification.
   Coarse grain traffic engineering, versus hop-by-hop traffic
   engineering, can be accomplished in a simple and unobtrusive manner.

   If paths in the network can be constructed out-of-band and stored in
   the LISP mapping system as ELP RLOC-records, then an encapsulator can
   solely make a decision which paths an encapsulated packet can take.
   This approach requires no extra overhead in the data packet.  How the
   encapsulator decides on which paths may be based on the telemetry
   data returned from ELP-Probing.

   When an ITR does a lookup to the LISP mapping system, an EID-to-RLOC
   mapping is returned.  The mapping has a set of RLOC records that can
   each be encoded as an Explicit Locator Path (ELP).  When the best
   priority of each RLOC-record is the same, the ITR can decide which
   ELP path to use for forwarding.  The ITR sends ELP-Probes on each ELP
   to gather data to choose either a best path or a policy defined path.

   If an EID-to-RLOC mapping has two RLOC-records, each with the ELPs
   (A, B, C, ETR) and (X, Y, Z, ETR), the ITR would send an ELP-Probe on
   each ELP path.  For the first path, the ITR would encapsulate an ELP-
   Probe message to RTR A.  RTR A would decapsulate the packet, add any
   telemetry data it has gathered from RLOC-Probes to RTR B, and then
   encapsulate the ELP-Probe to RTR B.  This continues until the ETR
   receives the ELP-Probe and simply sends an ELP-Probe reply back to
   the ITR.  The ITR follows the same procedures for the second ELP path
   that starts with RTR X.

5.  RLOC-Probing

   The general procedure for RLOC-probing is described in
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis].  RLOC-probes are sent between RTRs in an
   ELP when the P-bit is set in the ELP-node entry of the ELP list
   [RFC8060].  ELP-Probing depends on an RTR sending RLOC-probes to the

   next RTR in the ELP list.  To get full telemetry data from each ELP-
   node hop, this specification recommends that the P-bit is set in each
   ELP-node listed in an ELP.

   The ELP-nodes do RLOC-probing asynchronously to gather reachability
   and RTT data from the next ELP hop.  So that when an ELP-Probe is
   received, the ELP-node has some measured data to add to the ELP-Probe
   message.

6.  ELP-Probing

   See [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis] for the general format of an RLOC-
   probe Map-Request.  An ELP-Probe message has the following format:

   header must be set to 255.  The Instance-ID in the LISP data-plane
   header must be 0xffffff.  The specific field settings for an ELP-
   Probe in a Map-Request message are:

   M-bit:  Is set specifying there is an EID-record after the requesting
      EID-prefix.

   P-bit:  Is set specifying this Map-Request is an RLOC-probe message
      being used for ELP-probing.

   Source EID:  Is not specified by setting the Source-EID-AFI to 0.

   EID-Prefix:  Is the EID prefix stored in the mapping system that
      corresponds to a RLOC-set with ELPs imbedded.

   EID-Record (Record):  Inserted by the originator of an ELP-Probe
      message.  The Locator Count is 0 and the EID-prefix is the same as
      the EID-prefix earlier in the message.

   Record TTL, ACT, A:  Not used therefore sent as 0 and ignored on
      receipt.

   RLOC-Record (Loc):  Each ELP-node will append an RLOC-record that
      holds its telemetry data.  The Loc-AFI will be the AFI of a LISP
      Canonical Address Format (LCAF) [RFC8060].

   L, p, R bits:  All set to 0 and ignore on reception.

   As the ELP-Probe moves from RTR to RTR, each RTR adds an RLOC-record
   to the EID-record in the Map-Request.  The RLOC-record will use a
   LCAF JSON Type [RFC8060] format.  Each RTR constructs the following
   JSON string:

{ "ELP-node" : "<rloc>", "HOPs" : "<hc>", "RTTs": ["<rtt1>", ..., "<rttn>"] }

   ELP-node:  Contains the same RLOC address as listed in the ELP.

   HOPs:  Is the number of underlay hops to this ELP-node from either
      the last ELP-node or the originator of the ELP-Probe.  The value
      is computed as 255 minus the arrival TTL value in the outer header
      of the ELP-Probe message.

   RTTs:  A list of round-trip-times to the next ELP-node.  Ordered from
      recent to less recent.

   A ELP-Probe Map-Reply message has the following format.  The EID-
   record is copied from the ELP-Probe Map-Request after the following
   header:

   P-bit:  This bit is set indicating this is a RLOC-probe message used
      for ELP-probing.

   Nonce:  Copied from the ELP-Probe Map-Request nonce.

   The last ELP-node in an ELP sends the ELP-Probe Map-Reply to the ITR-
   RLOC address from the ELP-Probe Map-Request with a source port 4342
   and destination port equal to the ephemeral port from the source port
   of the ELP-Probe Map-Request.  Optionally, the ELP-Probe Map-Reply
   can be data encapsulated to destination port 4341 but if the ELP-
   Probe originator is behind a NAT device, the source port must be 4341
   and the destination port is the translated ephemeral port from the
   source port of ELP-Probe Map-Request.

7.  Data-Plane Operation

   When an ITR/PITR/RTR select an ELP from one of many ELP-encoded RLOC-
   records, the downstream RTRs need to use the same path or forwarding
   loops can occur.  The use of the Locator-Status-Bits in the LISP
   header will serve the encapsulator to instruct the downstream ELP-
   nodes which RLOC-record to use.

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   L   |N|L|E|V|I|R|K|K|            Nonce/Map-Version                  |
   I \ +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   P   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The encapsulator sets the L-bit in the LISP header which allows it to
   select up to 256 RLOC-records by specifying values 0 to 255 in the
   low-order 8-bits of the "Instance ID/Locator-Status-Bits" field
   above.

   The following example is constructed to explain the operation:

   EID-prefix:   10.0.0.0/8
   Locator-set:  (A, B, C, ETR-A): priority 1, weight 50  (path 1)
                 (A, I, J, ETR-A): priority 1, weight 50  (path 2)
                 (S, T, U, ETR-A): priority 2, weight 50  (path 3)
                 (X, T, Z, ETR-A): priority 2, weight 50  (path 4)

   When an ITR receives a packet from a source destined to EID 10.1.1.1,
   the above mapping will be returned from the mapping system.  The ITR
   will decide which of the two priority 1 RLOC-records to use.  When it
   determines the lower delay path is path 1, it sets the LSB field to
   0.  When A gets the encapsulated data packet, it is instructed to use
   path 1 and encapsulate to RTR B (and not RTR I from path 2).

   When the ITR determines path 1 and path 2 are both down, it can use
   the priority 2 RLOC-records.  If the path from T to U is down, the
   ITR would select path 4 and set the LSB field to 3 so T does not try
   to encapsulate to the down path U but use the path to Z.

   Using this head-end mechanism allows one node in the network to
   switch to reachable, quality, and non-looping paths very quickly
   without any explicit control-plane signaling to any other nodes.

8.  Security Considerations

   RLOC-record ELPs stored in the mapping system use the authentication
   mechanisms described [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis] and
   [I-D.farinacci-lisp-ecdsa-auth].  The ELP-Probe Map-Reply messages
   can be signed using [I-D.ietf-lisp-sec].

   Since the ELP-Probe message is encapsulated as a LISP data packet,
   telemetry data can be kept private by the use of [RFC8061].  ELP-
   Probe Map-Reply messages could also be data encapsulated to make use
