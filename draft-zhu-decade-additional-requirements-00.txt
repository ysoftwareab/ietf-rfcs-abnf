1. Introduction

   DECADE (DECoupled Application Data Enroute) is an architecture that
   provides applications with access to in-network storage. The target
   of DECADE is to provide an open and standard in-network storage
   system for application, primarily P2P applications, to store,
   retrieve and manage their data [draft-ietf-decade-reqs-00].

   And the [draft-ietf-decade-reqs-00] presents that the DECADE support
   majority of existing application, including P2P application and none
   P2P application. As considering CDN application and the mobility
   scenarios, we present a set of requirements that should be met by the
   DECADE architecture design in order to guarantee its applicability to

   such applications. We propose that these requirements be added to the
   DECADE requirements specification.

   In this memo, we align the requirement description to the layout and
   requirements classification used in [draft-ietf-decade-reqs-00].                 rd     th       Section 3  and 4  describes the additional protocol requirements and                                                     th       storage requirements separately, and section 5  presents and
   discuses the corresponding open issues that are mentioned in [draft-
   ietf-decade-reqs-00] or some issues should be considered to ensure a
   broad enough applicability of the DECADE framework

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

   This memo uses terminology and definitions defined in DECADE [I-
   D.ietf-decade-problem-statement].

   Terms defined in this memo:

   o Serving-in-network storage: the in-network storage which actually
      send data to user.

   o Proxy-in-network storage: the selected in-network storage in which
      the resource is ingested initially.

3. Protocol requirements

3.1. Request redirect requirement

   Request redirecting is responsible for routing client request to the
   appropriate in-network storage for the delivery of data. That suits
   the following situations:

   o Adaptive in-network storage selection

      Due to the different copies deployment over the network, the
      serving-in-network storage status and the dynamic change of
      network environments, the serving-in-network storage may not be
      suitable any more. So, DECADE must support redirecting the client
      request to the best suitable in-network storage. It may use a set


zhu                    Expires June 26, 2011                 [Page 3]

      of metrics, such as network proximity, available bandwidth, and
      client perceived latency, distance, and in-network storage load
      and other factors, in an attempt to find the appropriate in-
      network storage that can best serve the request. The selected in-
      network storage delivers requested data to the end-users. Thus,
      transparency for users is achieved. However, how to select the
      best in-network storage is out of scope of the DECADE.

      This approach helps to reduce network impact on the response time
      of user requests and performs load balancing across a number of
      in-network storages and increase the system capacity under load. A
      centralized in-network storage can act at the front end of an in-
      network storage farm and redirects the data request to a nearby
      application-specific in-network storage. Hence, the centralized
      in-network storage gathers necessary information in order to make
      load balancing decisions.

   o Mobility

      With the rapid development of the types and users of data service
      in the mobile terminal and the traffic generated by data service,
      DECADE must support the application in wireless network
      environment and have the ability to support roaming for
      terminals/users/applications by allowing the use of in-network
      storage in the visited network [draft-ohlman-decade-add-use-cases-
      reqs-01]. Actually the mobility situation can also be understood
      as part of the dynamic change of network environments mentioned in
      the first point, but the in-network storage before may remain
      suitable after the terminal roaming. However, in order to reduce
      the cross network traffic, the request redirection may be needed.

3.1.1. Discussion

3.1.1.1. The existing protocol requirements

   The following point mentioned in [draft-ietf-decade-reqs-00]:

   o Some applications may have requirements on delivery time (e.g.,
      live streaming). The DECADE MUST provide "low-latency" access for
      application clients. DECADE MUST allow clients to specify at least
      two classes of services for service: lowest possible latency and
      latency non-critical.

   the requirement here needs the request redirect to implement.

Internet-Draft  Additional protocol requirements on DECADE December 2010


3.1.1.2. The existing protocols

   The following existing protocols are put forward to give some idea
   for this kind of scenario:

   o NECP [draft-cerpa-necp-01]: the Network Element Control Protocol
      is a lightweight protocol for signaling between servers and the
      network elements that forward traffic to them. The network
      elements consist of a range of devices, including content-aware
      switches and load-balancing routers. NECP allows network elements
      to perform load balancing across a farm of servers and redirection
      to interception proxies.

   o WCCP [draft-wilson-wrec-wccp-v2-01]: The Web Cache Coordination
      Protocol specifies interaction between one or more routers and one
      or more Web-caches. It runs between a router functioning as a
      redirecting network element and interception proxies. The selected
      traffic is redirected to a group of Web-caches in order to
      increase resource utilization and to minimize response time.

3.2. Multi-connection requirement

   User accesses data stored in multiple storages simultaneously when:

   o Having multiple serving-in-network storages

   Users may have the serving-in-network storages at the same time. In
   that case, the multi-connection may be established between client and
   other serving-in-network storages, which may need information
   interaction between different connections to avoid the operation
   unsynchronized.

   For example, client deletes the data uploaded to multiple in-network
   storages at the same time. And the operation of deletion to different
   storage may decide deleting different parts (chunk-level or piece-
   level) of the data, which needs to be coordinated.

   Or considering the requirement descried in [draft-ietf-decade-reqs-00]
   as data reuse, the operation launched in different connection may
   work with the same data.

   o Supporting "soft handover" in wireless network and the in-network
      storage change

   The request-routing requirement mentioned before may lead the change
   of serving-in-network storage. The handover of the serving-in-network
   storages needs to the "soft" to ensure the service continuity. That


zhu                    Expires June 26, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft  Additional protocol requirements on DECADE December 2010


   requires the connection between the client and the current serving-
   in-network storage will not be disconnected until the new establish
   of connection between client and the new serving-in-network storage.
   That means user needs to communicate with multiple in-network storage
   about the data transmission proceeding simultaneously.

   Meanwhile, in the mobility scenario, the access network may change,
   e.g., change from the 3G to wLan, when user moves. The different
   access network has the different authorization and authentication
   mechanism and message flow, which means the DECADE IAP support the
   smooth transition between the different authorization and
   authentication mechanisms.

3.3. Data distribution requirement

   Data distribution is strategically vital in DECADE for efficient data
   delivery and for overall performance. Each of in-network storages
   wants to delivery their data to users over the network in a reliable
   and timely manner. The data is moved from the proxy-in-network
   storage (which has stored the data initially) to the other in-network
   storage which can be selected according to some principals. The
   distribution is transparent to the users as they interact with the
   in-network storage as a single logical system.

   In the P2P file sharing or P2P file downloading or similar
   applications, data distribution will help applications complete the
   data publication. Client will upload its data in the in-network
   storage and hope other clients may get the data in time, especially
   when the client is content provider. The serving-in-network storage
   will be act as a proxy-in-network storage to complete the data
   distribution in the DECADE. The process and result of data
   distribution may be decided by the range (number of domain) and
   granularity of distribution (piece-level or content-level way), and
   the access control, authentication and authorization information of
   distributed data and other relative complementary parameters
   configured manually or automatically.

3.3.1. Discussion

   o The requirement is a kind of typical CDN scenario.

   o The targeted in-network storage in the process of data
      distribution can be selected based on kinds of factors, including
      the technical factors, e.g. the data type (static, dynamic and
      streaming content), or some business factors, e.g. distribution
      range.

3.4. Service assurance related requirements

   Actually, service assurance related requirements refer to control
   mechanisms in the DECADE service to ensure a certain level of
   performance to a data flow. That means service quality should be
   achieved in the DECADE service. Quality of service is the ability to
   provide different priority to different applications, users, or data
   flows to guarantee a certain level of performance, which is important
   to the application and user experience, especially for real-time
   streaming application.

3.4.1. Discussion

   Service assurance mechanisms can be classified by whether or not the
   receiver feedback to the sender.

   o Resource reservation

   The resource reservation mechanism is characterized by having no
   feedback between the receiver and the transmitter. This means
   resource allocation is made at connection setup using connection
   admission control and this allocation is made using information that
   is already "old news" during the lifetime of the connection. And the
   resource needed cannot change on demand.

   o Dynamical feedback

   The Dynamical feedback control mechanism is characterized by the
   ability of the network to report service parameters, e.g., service
   response time, back to the transmitter. This information is then used
   by the transmitter in various ways to adapt its activity to existing
   network conditions. But the feedback data will cause the load
   increasing, which will be a bad way in the congestion network.

The mechanism may be taken either or both in DECADE or other mechanism
if needed.

4. Storage requirements

4.1. Data classification storage requirement

   Different kinds of application data are stored in categories. For
   example, the data for streaming and the data for downloading are
   stored and process separately. That can be benefit in:

   o Speeding the data access and retrieve because of reducing the time
      looking up the content in category ;


zhu                    Expires June 26, 2011                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft  Additional protocol requirements on DECADE December 2010


   o Different kind of data has its own use pattern and its life cycle
      and also different process mechanism. The classification storage
      of data may improve the data use efficiency.

4.2. Small objects storage requirement

   The in-network storage should support the small objects (chunk-level
   or piece-level) storage, because:

   o In the existing DECADE requirement[draft-ietf-decade-reqs-00], the
      data object size in DECADE allow for efficient data transfer of
      small objects (e.g., 16KB) between DECADE client and in-network
      storage with minimal additional latency required by the protocol.
      What's more, mainstream P2P applications adopt the chunk or piece
      transition and chunk or piece storage mechanism. The storage
      should satisfy the existed requirement.

   o And the in-network storage has the limited storage capacity, with
      the arrival of user requests and data distribution requirements,
      the data stored in the in-network storage will be replaced if the
      storage reaches the limit and data arrivals continually. To ensure
      and complete the user`s data delivery, the data replaced will be
      in the size of small object. And that results in the small objects
      storage.

5. Open issues

5.1. Removal of Expired Records

   The [draft-ietf-decade-reqs-00] mentions the requirement that the
   DECADE should not provide ability to update existing objects. If a
   user needs to update a resource, it can store a new resource and then
   distribute the new resource instead of the old one. And the [draft-
   ietf-decade-reqs-00] also mentions that there are actually two
   possible scenarios here. The first is the case of removing duplicates
   within one particular DECADE server (or logical server). The second
   scenario is removing duplicates across a distributed set of DECADE
   servers. However, the two scenarios did not mention how to handle the
   old resource if the user distributes the new resource which is an
   updated copy of the old resource.

   Here, the older resource is flagged as expired record instantly as
   soon as the new version is uploaded. The deletion of the expired
   record will be adopted because of the content consistency, naming
   simplicity and content requested certainty.
