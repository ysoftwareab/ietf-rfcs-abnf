                   Reserved BGP extended communities
          draft-decraene-idr-reserved-extended-communities-00

Abstract

   This document assigns two BGP extended community types, one
   transitive and one non-transitive.  It also defines two IANA
   registries in order to allow the allocation of reserved transitive
   and non-transitive extended communities.  These are similar to the
   existing reserved (formerly Well-known) BGP communities defined in
   RFC 1997 but provides an easier control of inter-AS community
   advertissement as a community could be chosen as transitive or non-
   transitive across ASes.

1.  Introduction

   RFC1997 [RFC1997] defines the BGP community attribute and some BGP
   Well known communities whose meaning SHALL be understood by all
   implementations compliant with RFC1997 [RFC1997]).  New reserved
   communities can be registred in the IANA "BGP Well-known Communities"
   registry but can't anymore be considered as well known.
   Implementations which do not reconize those new reserved communities
   will propagate them from BGP neigbour to BGP neigbour and from AS to
   AS with an unlimited scope.

   RFC 4360[RFC4360] defines the BGP extended community attribute with a
   structure including a type and a transitive bit "T".  The transitive
   bit, when set, allows to restrict the scope of the community within
   an AS.  Without structure, this can only be accomplished by
   explicitly enumerating all community values that will be denied or
   allowed and passed to BGP speakers in neighboring ASes.  RFC
   4360[RFC4360] defines IANA registries to allocate BGP Extended
   Communities types.  Each type is able to encode 2^48 or 2^56 values
   depending on the type being extended or regular.  It does not define
   an IANA registry to allocate single reserved communities.  Therefore,
   one needing to reserve a single non-transitive extended community
   would need to reserve an extended subtype which represents 2^48
   communities.  This would both waste the ressources and disable the
   ability to define global policies on reserved communities, such as to
   filter them out.

   This document assigns two BGP extended community types, one
   transitive and one non-transitive.  It also defines two IANA
   registries in order to allow the allocation of reserved transitive
   and non-transitive extended communities.  These are similar to the
   existing reserved ("Well-known") BGP communities defined in RFC 1997
   but provides an easier control of inter-AS community advertissement
   as a community could be chosen as transitive or non-transitive across
   ASes.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign, from the registry "BGP Extended
   Communities Type - extended, transitive type", a type value TBD for
   "BGP Reserved transitive extended communities":

    Registry Name: BGP Extended Communities Type - extended, transitive

       Name                                           Type Value
       ----                                           ----------
       BGP Reserved transitive extended communities   TBD (e.g. 0x9000)



   IANA is requested to assign, from the registry "BGP Extended
   Communities Type - extended, non-transitive", a type value TBD for
   "BGP Reserved non-transitive extended communities":

 Registry Name: BGP Extended Communities Type - extended, non-transitive

    Name                                               Type Value
    ----                                               ----------
    BGP Reserved non-transitive extended communities   TBD (e.g. 0xd000)


   Note to the IANA: suggested value for the two reserved BGP Extended
   Communities extended type are 0x9000 and 0xd000.  Otherwise, both
   values should be identical, except for their T - Transitive bit (bit
   1 as defined in RFC 4360 [RFC4360]).



   The IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry entitled "BGP
   Reserved transitive extended communities".

 Registry Name: BGP Reserved transitive extended communities

    Range                         Registration Procedures
    ---------------------------   -------------------------
    0x000000000000-FFFFFFFEFFFF   Reserved
    0xFFFFFFFF0000-00FFFFFF8000   First Come First Served
    0x00FFFFFF8001-FFFFFFFFFFFF   Standards Action/Early IANA Allocation



   The IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry entitled "BGP
   Reserved non-transitive extended communities".

Internet-Draft        Reserved extended communities         October 2010


 Registry Name: BGP Reserved non-transitive extended communities

    Range                         Registration Procedures
    ---------------------------   -------------------------
    0x000000000000-FFFFFFFEFFFF   Reserved
    0xFFFFFFFF0000-00FFFFFF8000   First Come First Served
    0x00FFFFFF8001-FFFFFFFFFFFF   Standards Action/Early IANA Allocation


   An application may need both a transitive and non-transitive reserved
   community.  It may be beneficial to have the same value for both
   communities.  (Note that both extended community will still be
   different as they will differ from their T bit).  IThe IANA SHOULD
   try to accomodate such request to have both a transitive and non-
   transitive reserved community with the same value for both.


3.  Security Considerations

   This document defines IANA actions.  In itself, it has no impact on
   the security of the BGP protocol.
