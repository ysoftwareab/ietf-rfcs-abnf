          Recommendation on Stable IPv6 Interface Identifiers
                    draft-ietf-6man-default-iids-00

Abstract

   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for IPv6 typically
   results in hosts configuring one or more stable addresses composed of
   a network prefix advertised by a local router, and an Interface
   Identifier that typically embeds a hardware address (e.g., an IEEE
   LAN MAC address).  The security and privacy implications of embedding
   hardware addresses in the Interface Identifier have been known and
   understood for some time now, and some popular IPv6 implementations
   have already deviated from such schemes to mitigate these issues.
   This document recommends [I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses] as
   the default scheme for the generating stable IPv6 addresses and
   recommends against embedding hardware addresses in IPv6 Interface
   Identifiers.

Internet-Draft            Default Interface-IDs             January 2014


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4862] specifies Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for
   IPv6 [RFC2460], which typically results in hosts configuring one or
   more "stable" addresses composed of a network prefix advertised by a
   local router, and an Interface Identifier (IID) [RFC4291] that
   typically embeds a hardware address (e.g., an IEEE LAN MAC address).

   The security and privacy implications of embedding a hardware address
   in an IPv6 Interface ID have been known for some time now, and are
   discussed in great detail in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy]; they include:

   o  Network activity correlation

   o  Location tracking

   o  Address scanning

   o  Device-specific vulnerability exploitation

   Some popular IPv6 implementations have already deviated from the
   traditional stable IID generation scheme to mitigate the
   aforementioned security and privacy implications [Microsoft].

   As a result of the aforementioned issues, this document recommends
   the implementation of an alternative scheme
   ([I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses]) as the default stable
   Interface-ID generation scheme, such that the aforementioned issues
   are mitigated.

   NOTE: [RFC4291] defines the "Modified EUI-64 format" for Interface
   identifiers.  Appendix A of [RFC4291] then describes how to transform
   an IEEE EUI-64 identifier, or an IEEE 802 48-bit MAC address from
   which an EUI-64 identifier is derived, into an interface identifier
   in the Modified EUI-64 format.

2.  Terminology

   Stable address:
      An address that does not vary over time within the same network
      (as defined in [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Generation of IPv6 Interface Identifiers

   Nodes SHOULD NOT employ IPv6 address generation schemes that embed
   the underlying hardware address in the Interface Identifier.  Namely,
   nodes SHOULD NOT generate Interface Identifiers with the schemes
   specified in [RFC2464], [RFC2467], and [RFC2470].

   Nodes SHOULD implement and employ
   [I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses] as the default scheme for
   generating stable IPv6 addresses with SLAAC.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document recommends [I-D.ietf-6man-stable-privacy-addresses] as
   the default scheme for generating IPv6 stable addresses with SLAAC,
   such that the security and privacy issues of Interface IDs that embed
   hardware addresses are mitigated.
