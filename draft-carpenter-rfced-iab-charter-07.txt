1.  Introduction

   In version 3 of the RFC Editor model defined by
   [I-D.iab-rfcefdp-rfced-model], the RFC Series is governed by its own
   mechanisms.  This requires a modification to the Internet
   Architecture Board charter [RFC2850].

   Note that RFC 2850 states that the RFC Editor appoints a liaison
   member to the IAB.  This does not change, but refers to the RFC
   Editor function as described in [I-D.iab-rfcefdp-rfced-model].

2.  Changed Text

   In Section 2 of RFC 2850, entitled "The Role of the IAB", under the
   sub-heading "(d) RFC Series and IANA", the following sentence:

   "The IAB must approve the appointment of an organization to act as
   RFC Editor and the general policy followed by the RFC Editor."

   is replaced by:

   "The RFC Editor function is defined under the authority of the IAB by
   [I-D.iab-rfcefdp-rfced-model]."

3.  Approval

   This document is published as an IETF Best Current Practice and has
   also been approved by the IAB.
