Internet-Draft   Requirements on Network Coding Support    December 2015


Abstract

   This document describes the requirements on providing the network
   coding capability in the mobile ad hoc network (MANET). For this,
   the conditions to be considered in providing the network coding
   capability in the MANET are listed.

Internet-Draft   Requirements on Network Coding Support    December 2015


1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   
2.  Introduction

   The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is composed of a number of mobile
   nodes which can communicate with each other through multiple
   wireless links without the help of a wired infrastructure.
   Because a wireless link is more restricted in its capacity than a
   wired link, the efficient utilization of wireless links is one of
   the important issues in wireless networs, especially in the MANET.

   The network coding is one of the mechanisms that can increase
   wireless network capacity [1]. In order to provide the network
   coding capability in the MANET, there are many things to be
   considered.

   In this draft, we define the requirements on supporting the network
   coding in the MANET.


3.  Requirements on the Provision of Network Coding

   In applying the network coding capability to the MANET, the
   following considerations have to be accomponied with:

   - the delay incurred by waiting at nodes to increase the possibility
     of encodings in a source-to-destination route
   - the number of encodings and decodings experienced by a packet
     in a source-to-destination route
   - the throughput perceived at destinations
   - the base MANET unicast routing protocol, such as AODV [2] or DSR
     [3], on which the network coding capability is applied
   - the degree of changes on the base MANET unicast routing protocol

   With considering the above-mentioned conditions, the provision of
   the network coding capability in the MANET SHOULD satisfy the
   following requirements:

   - The delay incurred by the network coding capability SHOULD be
     controlled such that it does not exceed a certain amount
   - The number of encodings and decodings SHOULD NOT exceed a given
     threshold

Internet-Draft   Requirements on Network Coding Support    December 2015


   - The modifications and/or extensions on the base MANET unicast
     routing protocol SHOULD NOT hinder the operation of the base MANET
     unicast routing protocol.
 
  
4.  Other Considerations

   TBD
