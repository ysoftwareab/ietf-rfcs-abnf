1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Extension Headers (EHs) allow for the extension of the IPv6
   protocol, and provide support for core functionality such as IPv6
   fragmentation.  However, common implementation limitations suggest
   that EHs present a challenge for IPv6 packet routing equipment and
   middle-boxes, and evidence exists that IPv6 packets with EHs may be
   intentionally dropped in the public Internet in some network
   deployments.

   The authors of this document have been involved in numerous
   discussions about IPv6 extension headers (both within the IETF and in
   other fora), and have noticed that the security and operational
   implications associated with IPv6 EHs were unknown to the larger
   audience participating in these discussions.

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers                July 2020


   This document has the following goals:

   o  Raise awareness about the operational and security implications of
      IPv6 Extension Headers, and presents reasons why some networks may
      intentionally drop packets containing IPv6 Extension Headers.

   o  Highlight areas where current IPv6 support by networking devices
      maybe sub-optimal, such that the aforementioned support is
      improved.

   o  Highlight operational issues associated with IPv6 extension
      headers, such that those issues are considered in IETF
      standardization efforts.

   Section 3 of this document summarizes the previous work that has been
   carried out in the area of IPv6 extension headers.  Section 4
   discuses packet forwarding engine constraints in modern routers.
   Section 5 discusses why modern routers and middle-boxes may need to
   access Layer-4 information to make a forwarding decision.  Finally,
   Section 6 discusses the operational implications of IPv6 EHs.

2.  Disclaimer

   This document analyzes the operational challenges represented by
   packets that employ IPv6 Extension Headers, and documents some of the
   operational reasons for which these packets may be dropped in the
   public Internet.  This document IS NOT a recommendation to drop such
   packets, but rather an analysis of why they are dropped.

3.  Previous Work on IPv6 Extension Headers

   Some of the operational implications of IPv6 Extension Headers have
   been discussed in IETF circles:

   o  [I-D.taylor-v6ops-fragdrop] discusses a rationale for which
      operators drop IPv6 fragments.

   o  [I-D.wkumari-long-headers] discusses possible issues arising from
      "long" IPv6 header chains.

   o  [I-D.kampanakis-6man-ipv6-eh-parsing] describes how
      inconsistencies in the way IPv6 packets with extension headers are
      parsed by different implementations may result in evasion of
      security controls, and presents guidelines for parsing IPv6
      extension headers with the goal of providing a common and
      consistent parsing methodology for IPv6 implementations.

   o  [I-D.ietf-opsec-ipv6-eh-filtering] analyzes the security
      implications of IPv6 EHs, and the operational implications of
      dropping packets that employ IPv6 EHs and associated options.

   o  [RFC7113] discusses how some popular RA-Guard implementations are
      subject to evasion by means of IPv6 extension headers.

   o  [I-D.ietf-intarea-frag-fragile] analyzes the fragility introduced
      by IP fragmentation.

   A number of recent RFCs have discussed issues related to IPv6
   extension headers, specifying updates to a previous revision of the
   IPv6 standard ([RFC2460]), many of which have now been incorporated
   into the current IPv6 core standard ([RFC8200]) or the IPv6 Node
   Requirements ([RFC8504]).  Namely,

   o  [RFC5095] discusses the security implications of Routing Header
      Type 0 (RTH0), and deprecates it.

   o  [RFC5722] analyzes the security implications of overlapping
      fragments, and provides recommendations in this area.

   o  [RFC7045] clarifies how intermediate nodes should deal with IPv6
      extension headers.

   o  [RFC7112] discusses the issues arising in a specific fragmentation
      case where the IPv6 header chain is fragmented into two or more
      fragments (and formally forbids such fragmentation case).

   o  [RFC6946] discusses a flawed (but common) processing of the so-
      called IPv6 "atomic fragments", and specified improved processing
      of such packets.

   o  [RFC8021] deprecates the generation of IPv6 atomic fragments.

   o  [RFC8504] clarifies processing rules for packets with extension
      headers, and also allows hosts to enforce limits on the number of
      options included in IPv6 EHs.

   o  [RFC7739] discusses the security implications of predictable
      fragment Identification values, and provides recommendations for
      the generation of these values.

   o  [RFC6980] analyzes the security implications of employing IPv6
      fragmentation with Neighbor Discovery for IPv6, and formally
      recommends against such usage.

   Additionally, [RFC8200] has relaxed the requirement that "all nodes
   examine and process the Hop-by-Hop Options header" from [RFC2460], by
   specifying that only to nodes that have been explicitly configured to
   process the Hop-by-Hop Options header are required to do so.

   A number of studies have measured the extent to which packets
   employing IPv6 extension headers are dropped in the public Internet:

   o  [PMTUD-Blackholes], [Gont-IEPG88], [Gont-Chown-IEPG89], and
      [Linkova-Gont-IEPG90] presented some preliminary measurements
      regarding the extent to which packet containing IPv6 EHs are
      dropped in the public Internet.

   o  [RFC7872] presents more comprehensive results and documents the
      methodology for obtaining the presented results.

   o  [Huston-2017] and [Huston-2020] measured packet drops resulting
      from IPv6 fragmentation when communicating with DNS servers.

4.  Packet Forwarding Engine Constraints

   Most modern routers use dedicated hardware (e.g.  ASICs or NPUs) to
   determine how to forward packets across their internal fabrics (see
   [IEPG94-Scudder] and [APNIC-Scudder] for details).  One of the common
   methods of handling next-hop lookup is to send a small portion of the
   ingress packet to a lookup engine with specialised hardware (e.g.
   ternary CAM or RLDRAM) to determine the packet's next-hop.  Technical
   constraints mean that there is a trade-off between the amount of data
   sent to the lookup engine and the overall performance of the lookup
   engine.  If more data is sent, the lookup engine can inspect further
   into the packet, but the overall performance of the system will be
   reduced.  If less data is sent, the overall performance of the router
   will be increased but the packet lookup engine may not be able to
   inspect far enough into a packet to determine how it should be
   handled.

   NOTE:
      For example, current high-end routers can use up to 192 bytes of
      header (Cisco ASR9000 Typhoon) or 384 bytes of header (Juniper MX
      Trio).

   If a hardware forwarding engine on a modern router cannot make a
   forwarding decision about a packet because critical information is
   not sent to the look-up engine, then the router will normally drop
   the packet.

   NOTE:

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers                July 2020


      Section 5 discusses some of the reasons for which a modern router
      might need to access layer-4 information to make a forwarding
      decision.

   Historically, some packet forwarding engines punted packets of this
   form to the control plane for more in-depth analysis, but this is
   unfeasible on most current router architectures as a result of the
   vast difference between the hardware forwarding capacity of the
   router and processing capacity of the control plane and the size of
   the management link which connects the control plane to the
   forwarding plane.

   If an IPv6 header chain is sufficiently long that its header exceeds
   the packet look-up capacity of the router, then it may be dropped due
   to hardware inability to determine how it should be handled.

5.  Requirement to Process Layer-3/layer-4 information in Intermediate
    Systems

   The following subsections discuss some of reasons for which modern
   routers and middle-boxes may need to process Layer-3/layer-4
   information to make a forwarding decision.

5.1.  ECMP and Hash-based Load-Sharing

   In the case of ECMP (equal cost multi path) load sharing, the router
   on the sending side of the link needs to make a decision regarding
   which of the links to use for a given packet.  Since round-robin
   usage of the links is usually avoided in order to prevent packet
   reordering, forwarding engines need to use a mechanism which will
   consistently forward the same data streams down the same forwarding
   paths.  Most forwarding engines achieve this by calculating a simple
   hash using an n-tuple gleaned from a combination of layer-2 through
   to layer-4 packet header information.  This n-tuple will typically
   use the src/dst MAC address, src/dst IP address, and if possible
   further layer-4 src/dst port information.  As layer-4 port
   information increases the entropy of the hash, it is normally highly
   desirable to use it where possible.

   We note that in the IPv6 world, flows are expected to be identified
   by means of the IPv6 Flow Label [RFC6437].  Thus, ECMP and Hash-based
   Load-Sharing would be possible without the need to process the entire
   IPv6 header chain to obtain upper-layer information to identify
   flows.  However, we note that for a long time many IPv6
   implementations failed to set the Flow Label, and ECMP and Hash-based
   Load-Sharing devices also did not employ the Flow Label for
   performing their task.

Internet-Draft           IPv6 Extension Headers                July 2020


   Clearly, widespread support of [RFC6437] would relieve middle-boxes
   from having to process the entire IPv6 header chain, making Flow
   Label-based ECMP and Hash-based Load-Sharing [RFC6438] feasible.

   While support of [RFC6437] is currently widespread for current
   versions of all popular host implementations, there is still only
   marginal usage of the IPv6 Flow Label for ECMP and load balancing
   [Cunha-2020] -- possibly as a result of issues that have been found
   in host implementations and middle-boxes [Jaeggli-2018].

5.2.  Enforcing infrastructure ACLs

   Generally speaking, infrastructure ACLs (iACLs) drop unwanted packets
   destined to parts of a provider's infrastructure, because they are
   not operationally needed and can be used for attacks of different
   sorts against the router's control plane.  Some traffic needs to be
   differentiated depending on layer-3 or layer-4 criteria to achieve a
   useful balance of protection and functionality, for example:

   o  Permit some amount of ICMP echo (ping) traffic towards the
      router's addresses for troubleshooting.

   o  Permit BGP sessions on the shared network of an exchange point
      (potentially differentiating between the amount of packets/seconds
      permitted for established sessions and connection establishment),
      but do not permit other traffic from the same peer IP addresses.

5.3.  DDoS Management and Customer Requests for Filtering

   The case of customer DDoS protection and edge-to-core customer
   protection filters is similar in nature to the infrastructure ACL
   protection.  Similar to infrastructure ACL protection, layer-4 ACLs
   generally need to be applied as close to the edge of the network as
   possible, even though the intent is usually to protect the customer
   edge rather than the provider core.  Application of layer-4 DDoS
   protection to a network edge is often automated using Flowspec
   [RFC5575].

   For example, a web site which normally only handled traffic on TCP
   ports 80 and 443 could be subject to a volumetric DDoS attack using
   NTP and DNS packets with randomised source IP address, thereby
   rendering traditional [RFC5635] source-based real-time black hole
   mechanisms useless.  In this situation, DDoS protection ACLs could be
   configured to block all UDP traffic at the network edge without
   impairing the web server functionality in any way.  Thus, being able
   to block arbitrary protocols at the network edge can avoid DDoS-
   related problems both in the provider network and on the customer
   edge link.

6.  Operational Implications

6.1.  Inability to Find Layer-4 Information

   As discussed in Section 5, modern routers and middle-boxes that need
   to find the layer-4 header must process the entire IPv6 extension
   header chain.  When such devices are unable to obtain the required
   information, they may simply resort to dropping the corresponding
   packets.

6.2.  Route-Processor Protection

   Most modern routers have a fast hardware-assisted forwarding plane
   and a loosely coupled control plane, connected together with a link
   that has much less capacity than the forwarding plane could handle.
   Traffic differentiation cannot be done by the control plane side,
   because this would overload the internal link connecting the
   forwarding plane to the control plane.

   The Hop-by-Hop Options header has been particularly challenging
   since, in most (if not all) implementations, it has typically caused
   the corresponding packet to be punted to a software path.  As a
   result, operators usually drop IPv6 packets containing this extension
   header.  Please see [RFC6192] for advice regarding protection of the
   router control plane.

6.3.  Inability to Perform Fine-grained Filtering

   Some router implementations lack fine-grained filtering of IPv6
   extension headers.  For example, an operator may want to drop packets
   containing Routing Header Type 0 (RHT0) but may only be able to
   filter on the extension header type (Routing Header).  As a result,
   the operator may end up enforcing a more coarse filtering policy
   (e.g. "drop all packets containing a Routing Header" vs. "only drop
   packets that contain a Routing Header Type 0").

6.4.  Security Concerns Associated with IPv6 Extension Headers

   The security implications of IPv6 Extension Headers generally fall
   into one or more of these categories:

   o  Evasion of security controls

   o  DoS due to processing requirements

   o  DoS due to implementation errors

   o  Extension Header-specific issues

   Unlike IPv4 packets where the upper-layer protocol can be trivially
   found by means of the "IHL" ("Internet Header Length") IPv4 header
   field, the structure of IPv6 packets is more flexible and complex,
   and may represent a challenge for devices that need to find this
   information, since locating upper-layer protocol information requires
   that all IPv6 extension headers be examined.  This has presented
   implementation difficulties, and packet filtering mechanisms that
   require upper-layer information (even if just the upper layer
   protocol type) have been found to be trivially evasible by inserting
   IPv6 Extension Headers between the main IPv6 header and the upper
   layer protocol.  [RFC7113] describes this issue for the RA-Guard
   case, but the same techniques can be employed to circumvent other
   IPv6 firewall and packet filtering mechanisms.  Additionally,
   implementation inconsistencies in packet forwarding engines may
   result in evasion of security controls
   [I-D.kampanakis-6man-ipv6-eh-parsing] [Atlasis2014] [BH-EU-2014].

   Packets that use IPv6 Extension Headers may have a negative
   performance impact on the handling devices.  Unless appropriate
   mitigations are put in place (e.g., packet dropping and/or rate-
   limiting), an attacker could simply send a large amount of IPv6
   traffic employing IPv6 Extension Headers with the purpose of
   performing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack (see Section 6 for
   further details).

   NOTE:
      In the most trivial case, a packet that includes a Hop-by-Hop
      Options header might go through the slow forwarding path, and be
      processed by the router's CPU.  Another possible case might be
      that in which a router that has been configured to enforce an ACL
      based on upper-layer information (e.g., upper layer protocol or
      TCP Destination Port), needs to process the entire IPv6 header
      chain (in order to find the required information), causing the
      packet to be processed in the slow path [Cisco-EH-Cons].  We note
      that, for obvious reasons, the aforementioned performance issues
      may affect other devices such as firewalls, Network Intrusion
      Detection Systems (NIDS), etc.  [Zack-FW-Benchmark].  The extent
      to which these devices are affected is typically implementation-
      dependent.

   IPv6 implementations, like all other software, tend to mature with
   time and wide-scale deployment.  While the IPv6 protocol itself has
   existed for over 20 years, serious bugs related to IPv6 Extension
   Header processing continue to be discovered.  Because there is
   currently little operational reliance on IPv6 Extension headers, the
   corresponding code paths are rarely exercised, and there is the
   potential for bugs that still remain to be discovered in some
   implementations.

   IPv6 Fragment Headers are employed to allow fragmentation of IPv6
   packets.  While many of the security implications of the
   fragmentation / reassembly mechanism are known from the IPv4 world,
   several related issues have crept into IPv6 implementations.  These
   range from denial of service attacks to information leakage, as
   discussed in [RFC7739], [Bonica-NANOG58] and [Atlasis2012]).
