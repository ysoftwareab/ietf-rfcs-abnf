Abstract

   This document describes a TLV for use in the IS-IS routing protocol
   that allows for the proper use of the Bidirectional Forwarding
   Detection protocol (BFD).  There exist certain scenarios in which
   IS-IS will not react appropriately to a BFD detected forwarding plane
   failure without use of either this TLV or some other method.

Internet-Draft            IS-IS BFD Enabled TLV            November 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection protocol [I-D.ietf-bfd-base]
   is a protocol that allows for detection of a forwarding plane failure
   between two routers.  A router can use [I-D.ietf-bfd-base] to
   validate that a peer router's forwarding ability is functioning.

   One specific application of BFD as described in
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-generic] is to verify the forwarding ability of an
   IS-IS [RFC1195] router's adjacencies; however, the method described
   in [I-D.ietf-bfd-generic] does not allow for certain failure
   scenarios.  We will define a TLV that will allow for proper response
   to the detection of all forwarding failures where the use of BFD is
   employed with IS-IS.


2.  The Problem

   We observe that to allow for mixed use (i.e., some routers running
   BFD and some not) [I-D.ietf-bfd-generic] does not require a BFD
   session be established prior to the establishment of an IS-IS
   adjacency.  Thus, if a router A has neighbors B and C, and B does not
   support BFD, A would still form adjacencies with B and C, and would
   only establish a BFD session with C.

   The problem with this solution is that it assumes that the
   transmission and receipt of IS-IS IIHs shares fate with forwarded
   data packets.  This is not a fair assumption to make given that the
   primary use of BFD is to protect IPv4 (and IPv6) forwarding and IS-IS
   does not utilize IPv4 or IPv6 for sending or receiving its hellos.

   Thus, if we consider our previous example, and if C is currently
   experiencing an IPv4 forwarding failure that allows for IS-IS IIHs to
   be sent and received, when A first starts (or restarts) A will assume
   that C simply does not support BFD, will form an adjacency with C,
   and may incorrectly forward IPv4 traffic through C.


3.  The Solution

   A simple solution to this problem is for an IS-IS router to advertise
   that it has BFD enabled on a given interface.  It can do this through
   the inclusion of a TLV in its IIHs, and indeed that is our proposal.

   When sending an IIH on a BFD enabled interface, a router which
   supports this extension MUST include the BFD enabled TLV in its IIH.
   The contents of the TLV MUST indicate what protocols have been
   enabled for BFD by including the appropriate NLPID(s).

Internet-Draft            IS-IS BFD Enabled TLV            November 2007


   When sending an IIH on an interface on which BFD is NOT enabled a
   router MUST NOT include the BFD enabled TLV.

3.1.  Determining Local Significance

   When receiving an IIH from a neighbor on an interface with BFD
   enabled, if the IIH contains the BFD enabled TLV the contents of the
   BFD TLV are examined to determine if they are of local significance.
   The logic used to determine local significance is impacted by the
   combination of topologies and NLPIDs supported on each topology by
   the local system.[I-D.ietf-isis-wg-multi-topology].  We introduce the
   following definitions:

   NLPID_LOCAL_BFD - The set of NLPIDs for which BFD has been locally
   enabled on an interface.

   NLPID_LOCAL_TOPO - The set of NLPIDs supported on a given topology.

   NLPID_BFD_TLV - The set of NLPIDs advertised in the BFD TLV in a
   received IIH.

   NLPID_BFD_TOPO - The set of NLPIDs which are common to
   (NLPID_LOCAL_BFD and NLPID_LOCAL_TOPO and NLPID_BFD_TLV).

   IIH_BFD_LSIG - A boolean which is TRUE when there exists at least one
   topology which is supported by both the local system and the neighbor
   where NLPID_BFD_TOPO is not empty.

   IS-IS_BFD_TOPO_UP - A per topology boolean whose value is TRUE when
   IIH_BFD_LSIG is TRUE, the topology is supported by both the local
   system and the neighbor, and either BFD session state for all NLPIDs
   in the corresponding NLPID_BFD_TOPO set is UP or the NLPID_BFD_TOPO
   set is empty for that topology.

   IS-IS_BFD_UP - A boolean whose value is TRUE when IIH_BFD_LSIG is
   TRUE and there is at least one topology supported by the local system
   and the neighbor which has an IS-IS_BFD_TOPO_UP value which is TRUE.

   If IIH_BFD_LSIG is FALSE then the contents of the corresponding
   received BFD TLV are ignored.  Note that this includes the case where
   BFD is not locally enabled on an interface for any NLPID.

3.2.  Adjacency Establishment and Maintenance

   When IIH_BFD_LSIG is TRUE, the following extensions to the rules for
   adjacency establishment and maintenance MUST apply:

Internet-Draft            IS-IS BFD Enabled TLV            November 2007


   o  IS-IS_BFD_UP state MUST be TRUE before the adjacency can
      transition from INIT to UP state

   o  When the IS-IS adjacency is UP and IS-IS_BFD_UP becomes FALSE the
      IS-IS adjacency MUST transition to DOWN.

   o  On a Point-to-Point circuit whenever IS-IS_BFD_UP is FALSE, the
      Three-Way adjacency state MUST be set to DOWN in the Point-to-
      Point Three Way Adjacency TLV[RFC3373] in all transmitted IIHs.

   o  On a LAN circuit whenever IS-IS_BFD_UP is FALSE, the IS Neighbors
      TLV advertising the MAC address of the neighbor MUST be omitted in
      all transmitted IIHs.

3.3.  Advertisement of Topology Specific IS Neighbors

   When IIH_BFD_LSIG is TRUE for a given neighbor, the advertisement of
   a topology specific IS-neighbor (as well as the use of the neighbor
   in the topology specific decision process) is determined by the value
   of IS-IS_BFD_TOPO_UP for each topology.  If IS-IS_BFD_TOPO_UP is TRUE
   then the topology specific neighbor is advertised.  If IS-
   IS_BFD_TOPO_UP is FALSE then the topology specific neighbor is NOT
   advertised.


4.  Transition

   To allow for a non-disruptive transition to the use of BFD some
   amount of time should be allowed before bringing down an UP adjacency
   on a BFD enabled interface when the value of IIH_BFD_LSIG becomes
   TRUE as a result of the introduction of the BFD TLV or the
   modification (by adding a new supported NLPID) of an existing BFD TLV
   in a neighbor's IIH.  A simple way to do this is to not update the
   adjacency hold-time when receiving such an IIH from a neighbor with
   whom we have an UP adjacency until IS-IS_BFD_UP becomes TRUE.

   If the value of IIH_BFD_LSIG becomes FALSE as a result of the removal
   the BFD TLV or the modification (by removing a supported NLPID) of an
   existing BFD TLV in a neighbor's IIH then BFD session establishment
   is no longer required to maintain the adjacency in or transition the
   adjacency to the UP state.

   If a BFD session is administratively shut down [I-D.ietf-bfd-base]
   and the BFD session state change would impact the value of IS-
   IS_BFD_UP, then IS-IS SHOULD allow time for the corresponding NLPID
   to be removed from the neighbor's BFD TLV by not updating the
   adjacency hold time until IIH_BFD_LSIG becomes FALSE.  Note that
   while this allows a non-disruptive transition, it still enforces

Internet-Draft            IS-IS BFD Enabled TLV            November 2007


   consistency between the administrative state of the BFD session and
   the NLPID(s) advertised in the BFD TLV.  This is necessary to provide
   consistent behavior regardless of whether the BFD AdminDown state is
   introduced before or after an IS-IS adjacency UP state has been
   achieved.


5.  Graceful Restart

   It is worth considering what if anything should be done when IS-IS is
   gracefully restarting [RFC3847].

   In cases where BFD shares fate with the control plane, it can be
   expected that BFD session failure may occur in conjunction with the
   control plane restart.  In such cases premature abort of IS-IS
   graceful restart as a result of BFD session failure is undesirable.
   Therefore, some mechanism to ignore the BFD session failure for a
   limited period of time would be beneficial.  How this is implemented
   is beyond the scope of this document.  Consult [I-D.ietf-bfd-generic]
   for further details.


6.  The BFD Enabled TLV

   The BFD enabled TLV is formatted as shown below.  The TLV SHALL only
   be included in an IS-IS IIH PDU and only when BFD is enabled for one
   or more supported protocols on the interface over which the IIH is
   being sent.  The NLPIDs encoded in the TLV are defined in [ISO9577]

     Type   139 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)
     Length # of octets in the value field (1 to 255)
     Value  one octet NLPID for each data protocol
            for which BFD support is enabled

                                          No. of octets
                +-----------------------+
                | NLPID                 |     1
                +-----------------------+
                :                       :
                :                       :
                +-----------------------+
                | NLPID                 |     1
                +-----------------------+

7.  Security Considerations

   The TLV defined within this document describes an addition to the
   IS-IS Hello protocol and does not impact the security mechanism of
   the IS-IS protocol.


8.  IANA Considerations

   The following IS-IS TLV type is defined by this draft.

   Name                                  Value  IIH   LSP  SNP
   ----------------------                -----  ---   ---  ---
   BFD Enabled TLV                         139   y     n    n

   Please update the IS-IS TLV Codepoint Registry accordingly.
