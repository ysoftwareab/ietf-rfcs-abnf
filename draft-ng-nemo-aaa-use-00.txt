1.  Introduction 
    
   The problem of Network Mobility Support (NEMO) is identified in 
   various previous works [3,4,5,6,7].  This document attempts to 
   explore the usage scenarios and requirements for Authentication, 
   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) in the NEMO problem space.  Since 
   NEMO entails various mobile devices accessing the Internet using 
   network resources that are in different administrative domains, AAA 
   is an important consideration for a NEMO solution. 
    
   In this document, we focus mainly on access control in NEMO.  Since 
   NEMO infrastructure is by and large wireless in nature, access 
   control is a critical aspect for large-scale deployment of support 
   for NEMO.  Such large-scale NEMO deployments are usually found in

   commercial applications, where Internet Service Providers (ISP) erect 
   fixed and mobile access routers and allow subscribers to attach 
   devices to the access routers for Internet connection.  Examples of 
   such commercial applications include providing Internet access in 
   trains, ships, and aircrafts. 
    
   Access control is needed in these networks in order to protect the 
   interest of the paying subscribers.  If there is no access control, 
   significant portions of the network resources may be used by 
   unauthorized users, thereby affecting the quality of service provided 
   to other legitimate subscribers. 
    
   The need for access control exists in all networks that allow unknown 
   devices to connect to the network, and to identify itself to gain 
   access to services and resources provided in the network.  Access 
   control function is usually provided by a gateway or router device, 
   generally known as a Network Access Server (NAS).  Excellent work on 
   requirements for NAS can be found in [8]. It is not the objective of 
   this document to duplicate previous effort in defining NAS 
   requirements.  Instead, this document explores specific requirements 
   that arise due to characteristics that are unique to a network in 
   motion.  To this end, this document first presents the overview of 
   operations in a network in motion.  Since a NEMO solution does not 
   exits (yet), this document assumes the operation to be based on a 
   reverse tunneling link between the mobile router in a mobile network 
   and the home agent in the home domain of the mobile router.  
   Following this, we describe possible usage scenarios of mobile 
   networks.  From the usage scenarios, basic AAA requirements are drawn 
   out. 
    
1.1.  Terms Used 
    
   It is assumed that readers are familiar with the NEMO terminology 
   described in [9]. 
    
1.2.  Assumptions 
    
   In this document, the following assumptions are made: 
     1. There exist an entity in the NEMO solution that resides in the 
        home domain of the mobile network node which provide 
        functionality similar to the home agent in the Mobile IP 
        specification. 
      
     2. This document assumes there is no need for local fixed nodes 
        (LFN) and local mobile nodes (LMN) to be authenticated by the 
        mobile router they attached to.  This is because the LFNs and 
        LMNs belongs to the same administrative domain as their MR, and 
        are always attached to the same mobile network.

2.  Overview of Operation 
    
2.1.  Overview of Visiting Mobile Nodes Operation 
    
   Access control of NEMO depends very much on the resources required 
   for NEMO solution.  To identify the resources required, we have to 
   model the general sequence of operation.  This model is applicable 
   whether the node is a mobile host or a mobile router.  We will use 
   the term Visiting Mobile Node (VMN) to meant both host and router.  
   The sequence of operation is as follows: 
    
     (1) VMN starts up and performs auto-configuration to use a link-
        local address. 
     (2) VMN obtains a global Care-of-Address (CoA) through router 
        solicitation, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 
        [10]. 
     (3) VMN discovers its Home Agent (HA) at its home domain. 
     (4) VMN sends the HA the appropriate binding updates. 
 
2.2.  Resources Needed for NEMO Operation 
    
   AAA is required in NEMO for two basic reasons:  
     (1) to control the access of and to account for the use of network 
        resources in the foreign domain, and  
     (2) to control the access of and to account for the use of network 
        resources in the home domain. 
    
   Network resources in the foreign domain that a VMN requires includes 
   a CoA, and the access to the wireless network channel.  AAA for the 
   use of foreign resources is generally performed in a "link-local" 
   manner, utilizing access protocols such as IEEE 802.1x [11] to gain 
   access to the wireless network channel, and protocols such as DHCP 
   [10] to get a CoA.  Since the link-layer and pool of IPv6 addresses 
   generally belongs to the same administrative domain, AAA for the 
   allocation of CoA is usually not required after granting access to 
   the link-layer network.   
    
   Network resources in the home domain that a VMN requires are the use 
   of HA, and the network bandwidth it consumes at the home domain for 
   the support of NEMO.  Since the lowest layer where the VMN can 
   connect to the home network is at the IP layer, AAA operations for 
   the use network resources in the home domain must be carried out in 
   the IP layer. 
 
2.3.  Overview of AAA Operation 
    
   A plausible scenario for AAA operations is that two types of AAA 
   protocols will be used: a "link-local" AAA protocol, and a "global" 
   AAA protocol.  The "link-local" AAA protocol is usually employed at

   link-layer, and usually takes place over a single network hop.  
   Examples include IEEE 802.1x [11], PANA [12], or other EAP-variant 
   protocols [13].  The "global" AAA protocol is normally employed at 
   the IP layer, and usually takes place over multiple network hops. 
   Examples include Diameter [14], or RADIUS [15]. 
    
   There are two main elements in AAA for NEMO.  The first is the MR 
   performing AAA negotiations with the access router, and the second is 
   the MR handling AAA negotiations from a VMN.  We will describe them 
   separately in the following sub-sections. 
    
2.3.1.  AAA Operation between MR and Access Router 
    
   Generally, a MR will initiate an access request by sending relevant 
   messages to the access router it attached to in the foreign domain 
   using a "link-local" AAA protocol.  The access router can then 
   contact the AAA server in the same domain to check the credentials 
   provided by the MR.  The AAA server in the foreign domain may or may 
   not have enough information to verify the credentials.  If the AAA 
   server in the foreign network does not have sufficient information, 
   it can contact the AAA server in the home domain of the MR to 
   complete the verification process.  Since the two AAA servers are 
   located in different domains, a "global" AAA protocol will have to be 
   used for the communications between them.  This is depicted in Figure 
   1 below.

2.3.2.  AAA Operation between VMN and MR 
    
   When a MR allows a VMN to attach to its local mobile network based on 
   some access control policy, the MR is essentially behaving as a 
   Network Access Server, or NAS.  As such, we basically model the 
   mobile router as NAS in this document, and draw heavily from work 
   done in IETF NASREQ Working Group [16]. 
    
   The VMN will first initiate an access request by sending relevant 
   messages to the MR it attached to using a "link-local" AAA protocol.  
   The MR will normally not have enough information to verify the 
   credentials of the VMN.  Thus it will have to contact an external AAA 
   server to perform the actual authentication and authorization.  This 
   external AAA server can be located anywhere in the global Internet.  
   Hence, the communications carried out between the MR and the AAA 
   server will employ one of the "global" AAA protocol.  This is 
   depicted in Figure 2 below.

2.4.  Home Resources vs Foreign Resources 
    
   The previous discussion only illustrates the access request for 
   foreign resources.  To gain access to home resources, the MR/VMN will 
   typically has to discover its HA in the home domain, and send binding 
   updates to its HA.  Access control on the use of home resources can 
   then be carried out by the HA after the reception of the binding 
   updates.  This can be done with the HA consulting an AAA server.  
   Since the main operation of access control of home resources is not 
   carried out by the nodes in the mobile network, we will focus on the 
   access control of foreign resources in the remaining sections of this 
   document. 
 
    
3.  Usage Scenario 
    
   In this section, we describe several usage scenarios of NEMO.  In our 
   descriptions, we will focus more on the AAA aspects of NEMO rather 
   than the routing solution.  A total of five scenarios are presented, 
   classified according to the administrative domains of the access 
   routers (ARs), top-level mobile routers (TLMRs), nested visiting 
   mobile router (VMR), and mobile network nodes (MNNs), as shown in 
   Table 1 below.  AD-1 and AD-2 are used to differentiate distinct 
   administration domains controlled by different Internet Service 
   Providers (ISP) or companies, and USER refers to the domain of 
   individual subscribers (or roaming subscribers) to AD-1. 
    
    
        Table 1: Administrative Domains (AD) in Different Scenarios 
    
                      AR          TLMR          VMR          MNN 
                  ----------   ----------   ----------   ---------- 
     Scenario 1      AD-1         AD-1         None         USER 
     Scenario 2      AD-2         AD-1         None         USER 
     Scenario 3      AD-1         USER         None         USER 
     Scenario 4      AD-1         AD-1         USER         USER 
     Scenario 5      AD-2         AD-1         USER         USER 
 
    
   In scenarios 1 and 2, the subscribers are individual VMH attached to 
   MR in a foreign domain.  The difference between scenarios 1 and 2 is 
   that in the first scenario, the MR and the AR it attached to belong 
   to the same administrative domain, while in scenario 2 they belong to 
   distinct administrative domains. 
    
   In scenarios 3, 4, and 5, the subscribers are moving networks 
   themselves.  The difference between these scenarios is that in 
   scenario 3, the subscribers attach directly to fixed AR, while in

Internet-Draft      Usage Scenario for AAA in NEMO        October 2002 
 
 
   scenarios 4 and 5 the subscribers attach to a MR.  For scenario 4, 
   the MR and the AR it attached to belong to the same administrative 
   domain, while in scenario 5 they belong to distinct administrative 
   domains. 
    
   Each scenario is described in greater details in the following sub-
   sections.  Examples of each scenario, and the AAA operations required 
   are also presented.   
    
    
3.1.  Scenario 1 
    
   In this scenario, subscribers are using their mobile devices to 
   connect to MRs that belongs to an Internet Service Provider (ISP).  
   The MRs have their points of attachment to the Internet via an AR 
   that belongs to the same ISP.  Two distinct types of administrative 
   domains are present: one for the AR and MRs, and one for each mobile 
   network nodes (MNN).  This is illustrated in Figure 3 below.

                           Figure 3: Scenario 1 
    
3.1.1.  Example 
    
   An example of such scenario will be the train network.  A railway 
   company may collaborate with an ISP to provide each cabin of the 
   trains with a MR.  Along the routes of the trains, the same ISP could 
   erect fixed ARs for the MRs of the train to connect to the Internet.  
   Passengers can then access the Internet via the MRs in the cabins.  
   Thus, each cabin (or possibly the entire train) can be treated as a 
   single mobile network.   
    
   In this case, the ISP/railway company owns both the ARs and the MRs.  
   The access devices of the subscribers (i.e. the passengers) are then 
   the MNNs.

Internet-Draft      Usage Scenario for AAA in NEMO        October 2002 
 
 
3.1.2.  AAA Operations 
    
   Since the MR for each mobile network belongs to the service provider 
   of the AR, the access authentication of the MR by the access routers 
   is straightforward.  Each handover of the MR between the ARs may 
   require access authentication.  No special consideration for NEMO is 
   necessary. 
    
   However, the MNNs (i.e. subscribers) will have to be authenticated by 
   the MR.  Two different possibilities arise: (1) the MNN is a 
   subscriber with the service provider of the train network, and (2) 
   the MNN is a roaming subscriber with another ISP. 
    
   For the first case where the MNN is a subscriber of the local ISP, 
   the AAA process would typically be the following: 
     
     -  The MNN makes a "link-local" access request to the MR. 
     -  The MR consults the local AAA server to check the credentials 
        of the subscriber. 
     -  The MR replies the request.  
    
   For the second case where the MNN is a roaming subscriber, the AAA 
   process would typically be the following: 
    
     -  The MNN makes a "link-local" access request to the MR. 
     -  The MR consults the local AAA server to check the credentials 
        of the subscriber. 
     -  The local AAA server consults the home AAA server of the MNN to 
        check the credentials of the subscriber. 
     -  Response is passed back from home AAA server, to local AAA 
        server, to MR back to the subscriber. 
    
 
3.2.  Scenario 2 
    
   This scenario is an extension of the previous one where the MRs may 
   not belong to the same administration domain as the ARs.  In this 
   case, 3 distinct types of administrative domains are present: an 
   administrative domain for the ARs, an administrative domain for MRs, 
   an administrative domain for each MNNs.  This illustrated in Figure 4 
   below.

                           Figure 4: Scenario 2 
    
3.2.1.  Examples 
    
   An example of this scenario is again the train illustration.  Here, 
   the train may travel along a route where the available ARs belong to 
   a different ISP.  Other examples include ships and planes. 
    
3.2.2.  AAA Operations for MR 
    
   Since the AR and MR belong to different administrative domains, each 
   handover of MR between different ARs may require AAA request/response 
   negotiations.  Such negotiations may employ standard mobile IP type 
   operations.  A typical AAA negotiation will be: 
    
     -  The MR makes a "link-local" access request to AR. 
     -  The AR consults the local AAA server to check credentials of 
        MR. 
     -  The local AAA server consults the home AAA server of the MR to 
        check credentials of MR. 
     -  Response is passed back to the local AAA server, AR and MR in 
        that order. 
    
3.2.3.  AAA Operations for MNNs 
    
   For the MNN, there are again two possibilities: a subscribing MNN or 
   a roaming MNN.  For both cases of MNN, it needs only be authenticated 
   by the MR once when the MNN first attaches to the MR.   
    
   For the first case where the MNN is a subscriber of the train 
   network, the AAA process would typically be the following:  
    
     -  The MNN makes a "link-local" access request to the MR. 
     -  The MR consults the local AAA server to check the credentials 
        of the subscriber. 
     -  The MR replies the AAA request.

Internet-Draft      Usage Scenario for AAA in NEMO        October 2002 
 
 
   For the second case where the MNN is a roaming subscriber, the AAA 
   process would typically be the following: 
    
     -  The MNN makes a "link-local" access request to the MR. 
     -  The MR consults the local AAA server to check the credentials 
        of the subscriber. 
     -  The local AAA server consults the home AAA server of the MNN to 
        check the credentials of the subscriber. 
     -  Response is passed back from home AAA server, to local AAA 
        server, to MR back to the subscriber. 
    
    
3.3.  Scenario 3 
    
   This scenario is the case where the mobile network belongs to a 
   single administrative domain, but its access to the Internet via an 
   AR in a foreign domain.  The mobile network does not allow VMNs to 
   attach to its mobile router. (In this document, we shall refer to 
   such mobile network as a private network).  This is illustrated in 
   Figure 5 below.

                           Figure 5: Scenario 3 
    
3.3.1.  Examples 
    
   One example of this scenario is the car network, where sensors, 
   laptops, and navigation systems are fixed nodes on the mobile car 
   network.  The vehicle would have a MR to roam through the AR provided 
   by the ISP along major streets. 
    
   Another common example is the Wireless Personal Area Network (W-PAN). 
   The equipment used by a person formed a bluetooth-based mobile 
   network, with the 802.11b-enabled laptop/PDA, or a GPRS-enabled 
   handphone acting as the MR.

Internet-Draft      Usage Scenario for AAA in NEMO        October 2002 
 
 
3.3.2.  AAA Operations 
    
   For this scenario, there is no need for AAA between the MR and the 
   MNNs.  The MR simply assumes that any node on the sub-net is an 
   authorized node of the network.  (Here, we ignore the situation of a 
   nearby third-party node trying to sneak in an unauthorized access.) 
   The only requirements that are relevant are the AAA negotiations 
   between the AR and MR, and this will be similar to the previous 
   scenario (scenario 2). 
    
   A typical AAA negotiation will be: 
    
     -  The MR makes a "link-local" access request to AR. 
     -  The AR consults the local AAA server to check credentials of 
        MR. 
     -  The local AAA server consults the home AAA server of the MR to 
        check credentials of MR. 
     -  Response is passed back to the local AAA server, AR and MR in 
        that order. 
    
    
3.4.  Scenario 4 
    
   This scenario is the nested extension of Scenario 1 plus Scenario 3.  
   Here, a mobile network attaches itself to a higher level mobile 
   network (NEMO-1).  The higher level MR (MR-1) and the AR belongs to a 
   single administrative domain, and the lower level mobile network 
   (NEMO-2) belongs to a single subscriber.  This is illustrated in 
   Figure 6 below.

3.4.1.  Examples 
    
   One example of this scenario is again the train.  Here the MR-1 are 
   installed on the trains and the ARs belong to the same railway

   company or ISP.  The passenger, however, may bring in a W-PAN network 
   onto the train.  Thus the W-PAN forms the NEMO-2, which attaches 
   itself to NEMO-1, the mobile network in the cabin of the train. 
    
3.4.2.  AAA Operations 
    
   In this scenario, there are two distinct administrative domains: one 
   encompassing the ARs and MR-1, and the other encompassing NEMO-2. 
   Since MR-1 for each NEMO-1 belongs to the service provider of the AR, 
   the access authentication of the MR by the AR is straightforward (as 
   in Scenario 1).  Each handover of the MR between the AR may require 
   access authentication.  In addition, there is no need for AAA 
   negotiations within NEMO-2, since this is usually a privately owned 
   network (eg. WPAN).  Thus the only case we have to consider is the 
   AAA negotiations between MR-1 and MR-2. 
    
   A typical AAA negotiation will be: 
    
     -  The MR-2 makes a "link-local" access request to MR-1. 
     -  The MR-1 consults its home AAA server to check credentials of 
        MR-2. 
     -  The home AAA server of MR-1 consults the home AAA server of MR-
        2 to check credentials of MR-2. 
     -  Response is passed back to the home AAA server of MR-1, MR-1 
        and MR-2 in that order. 
    
    
3.5.  Scenario 5 
    
   This scenario is the nested extension of Scenario 2 plus Scenario 3.  
   Here, a mobile network attaches itself to a higher level mobile 
   network (NEMO-1).  The higher level mobile router (MR-1) and the AR 
   belongs to different administrative domains, and the lower level 
   mobile network (NEMO-2) belongs to a single subscriber.  This is 
   illustrated in Figure 7 below.

3.5.1.  Examples 
    
   One example of this scenario is again the train.  Here the MRs on the 
   trains and the access routers belong to different railway companies 
   or ISP.  The passenger bring in a wireless PAN network onto the 
   train.  Thus the W-PAN is the lower level mobile network (NEMO-2), 
   the cabin of the train is the higher level mobile network (NEMO-1). 
    
3.5.2.  AAA Operations 
    
   In this scenario, there are 3 different types of administrative 
   domains: one for the AR, one for NEMO-1, and one for each NEMO-2.  
   Again, no AAA negotiation is necessary within NEMO-2 as it is solely 
   owned by a single administrative agent. 
    
   AAA negotiations between AR and MR-1 is similar to those depicted in 
   Scenario 3.  A typical AAA negotiation will be: 
    
     -  The MR-1 makes a "link-local" access request to AR. 
     -  The AR consults the local AAA server to check credentials of 
        MR-1. 
     -  The local AAA server consults the home AAA server of MR-1 to 
        check credentials of MR-1. 
     -  Response is passed back to the local AAA server, AR and MR-1 in 
        that order. 
    
   When MR-2 first enters the influence of NEMO-1, it will have to 
   perform AAA negotiation with MR-1.  This is similar to scenario 4.  A 
   typical AAA negotiation will be: 
    
     -  The MR-2 makes a "link-local" access request to MR-1. 
     -  The MR-1 consults its home AAA server to check credentials of 
        MR-2. 
     -  The home AAA server of MR-1 consults the home AAA server of MR-
        2 to check credentials of MR-2. 
     -  Response is passed back to the home AAA server of MR-1, MR-1 
        and MR-2 in that order. 
    
    
4.  AAA Requirements 
    
   From the usage scenario, we can identify the set of requirements 
   described below.  It must be noted that the requirements specified 
   are by no means exhaustive.  Since a NEMO solution has yet to be 
   specified, these requirements are merely spelt out to generate 
   further discussion within the NEMO working group.  When a NEMO 
   solution is eventually specified, AAA requirements by NEMO can be 
   rapidly generated by building on top of this document.

Internet-Draft      Usage Scenario for AAA in NEMO        October 2002 
 
 
     
     (1)The AAA servers MUST be able to share, or dynamically establish 
        security associations with external authorities that are able 
        to verify the credentials provided by the client. 
      
        This requirement is a direct induction from the need for AAA 
        servers of ARs/MRs to consult home AAA servers of mobile 
        network nodes for verifications of client's credentials.  Since 
        these AAA servers usually belong to different administrative 
        domains, it is necessary for AAA operations to provide a 
        mechanism for AAA servers in two different domains to establish 
        a security relationship between each other. 
      
     (2)The VMN or MR MUST be able to provide complete, unforgeable 
        credentials without having to contact its home agent. 
      
        Since VMN or the MR would initiate network connectivity from a 
        foreign domain, it is necessary for it to be able to provide 
        credentials without having first granted access to NEMO 
        resources.  Thus it has to be able to provide credentials 
        sufficient for verifications without the ability to contact any 
        other nodes in its home domain. 
    
     (3)Intermediate nodes MUST not be able to learn any information 
        which may enable them to reconstruct and reuse the credentials. 
    
        This requirement protects the AAA servers from replay attacks.  
        It is necessary for the ARs/MRs to be able to process the 
        credentials provided by the MRs/VMNs and yet unable to 
        reconstruct the credentials independently at a later time, so 
        that malicious AR/MR cannot use the credentials to launch a 
        replay attack against the home AAA server.  It also serves to 
        protect the MRs/VMNs from the visited NEMO. 
      
   In addition, to the above requirements, the following security 
   requirements need to be considered. 
    
     (4)AAA request and response operations between the ARs/MRs and the 
        respective AAA servers MUST prevent eavesdropping. 
    
        Any AAA operations MUST prevent the confidential information 
        passed between the AR/MR and the corresponding AAA server from 
        being known by eavesdroppers in the network.  This is 
        especially needed since NEMO typically operates in a wireless 
        environment. 
      
     (5)AAA request and response operations between the ARs/MRs and the 
        respective AAA servers MUST NOT be vulnerable to denial-of-
        service attack.

Internet-Draft      Usage Scenario for AAA in NEMO        October 2002 
 
 
    
        Since AAA operations typically entail cryptographic 
        computations in the nodes involved, it is necessary to consider 
        denial of service attacks by consuming CPU and memory resources 
        to process illegitimate AAA requests, thereby preventing 
        authentication of a legitimate mobile network node. 
      
     (6)AAA request and response operations between the ARs/MRs and the 
        respective AAA servers MUST NOT be vulnerable to man-in-the-
        middle attack. 
    
        Since AAA operations may involve more than two nodes and 
        operate over multiple hops, it MUST prevent communications 
        between two legitimate nodes from being spoofed by an attacker 
        in the middle. 
      
   The following are the set of requirements for NEMO in considerations 
   to AAA operations. 
    
     (7)MR that supports attachment of VMN on its internal link SHOULD 
        implement AAA client capability to be able to contact MR's home 
        AAA server to check on credentials provided by the visiting 
        nodes. 
      
        It is generally not expected for MR to implement a full AAA 
        server for scalability reasons.  However, MR should be 
        configured to consult an AAA server (possibly an AAA server 
        from the MR's home domain) for verifications of credentials 
        from the VMN. 
 
     (8)MR that support attachment of VMN on its internal links SHOULD 
        NOT change its AAA policy for the said VMNs during a continuous 
        session, even when the MR has undergone a handover between AR 
        of different administrative domains. 
      
        It is expected for handover of MR should be transparent to VMNs 
        behind the MR. Thus, a change in administrative domain of the 
        AR should not be propagated to nodes behind the MR. 
      
    
5.  Security Considerations 
    
   This document illustrates the usage scenarios of NEMO AAA operations, 
   and specifies the NEMO AAA requirements.  Because AAA is security 
   driven, security considerations are spelt out in the requirements.
