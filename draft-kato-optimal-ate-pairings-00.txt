Abstract

   Pairing is a special map from two elliptic curve that called Pairing-
   friend curves to a finite field and is useful mathematical tools for
   constructing cryptographic primitives.  It allows us to construct
   powerful primitives. (e.g. [3] and [4])

   There are some types of pairing and its choice has an impact on the
   performance of the primitive.  For example, Tate Pairing [3] and Ate
   Pairing [4] are specified in IETF.  This memo focuses on Optimal Ate
   Pairing [2] which is an improvement of Ate Pairing.

   This memo defines Optimal Ate Pairing for any pairing-friendly curve.
   We can obtain concrete algorithm by deciding parameters and building
   blocks based on the form of a curve and the description in this memo.
   It enables us to reduce the cost for specifying Optimal Ate Pairing
   over additional curves.  Furthermore, this memo provides concrete
   algorithm for Optimal Ate Pairing over BN-curves [7] and its test
   vectors.

Internet-Draft             Optimal Ate Pairing                 July 2015


1.  Introduction

   Pairing is a special map from two elliptic curve that called Pairing-
   friend curves (PFCs) to a finite field and is useful mathematical
   tools for constructing cryptographic primitives.  It allows us to
   construct powerful primitives like Identity-Based Encryption (IBE)
   [5] and Functional Encryption (FE) [6].  The IBE and FE provide a
   rich decryption condition.  Some Pairing-Based Cryptography is
   specified in IETF. (e.g. [3] and [4])

   There are some types of pairing and its choice has an impact on the
   performance of the primitive.  For example, primitives by using Tate
   Pairing [3] and Ate Pairing [4] are specified in IETF.  This memo
   focuses on Optimal Ate Pairing which is an improvement of Ate
   Pairing.  Optimal Ate Pairing allows us to construct Pairing-Based
   Cryptography with high performance and is implemented in some open
   source softwares. ([8], [9], and [10])

   This memo defines Optimal Ate Pairing [2] for any PFC.  We can obtain
   concrete algorithm by deciding parameters and two building blocks
   based on the form of a curve.  It enables us to reduce the cost for
   describing the body of Optimal Ate Pairing when Optimal Ate Pairing
   is specified over additional curves in IETF.  Furthermore, this memo
   provides concrete algorithm for Optimal Ate Pairing over BN-curves
   [7] and its test vectors.  This memo is expected to use by combining
   Optimal Ate Pairing with a suitable PFC for a primitive in order to
   realize same functional structure of ECDSA and ECDH. (i.e.  DSA over
   elliptic curve and DH over elliptic curve)

2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   memo are to be interpreted as described in [1].

3.  Preliminaries

   In this section, we introduce the definition of elliptic curve and
   bilinear map, notation used in this memo.

3.1.  Elliptic Curve

   Throughout this memo, let p > 3 be a prime, q = p^n, and n be a
   natural number.  Also, let F_q be a finite field.  The curve defined
   by the following equation E is called an elliptic curve.

   E : y^2 = x^3 + A * x + B such that A, B are in F_q,
             4 * A^3 + 27 * B^2 != 0 mod F_q

Internet-Draft             Optimal Ate Pairing                 July 2015


   Solutions (x, y) for an elliptic curve E, as well as the point at
   infinity, are called F_q-rational points.  The additive group is
   constructed by a well-defined operation in the set of F_q-rational
   points.  Typically, the cyclic additive group with prime order r and
   the base point G in its group is used for the cryptographic
   applications.  Furthermore, we define terminology used in this memo
   as follows.

      O_E: the point at infinity over elliptic curve E.

      #E(F_q): number of points on an elliptic curve E over F_q.

      cofactor h: h = #E(F_p)/r.

      embedding degree k: minimum integer k such that r is a divisor of
      q^k - 1

3.2.  Bilinear Map

   Let G_1 be an additive group of prime order r and let G_2 and G_T be
   additive and multiplicative groups, respectively, of the same order.
   Let P, Q be generators of G_1, G_2 respectively.  We say that (G_1,
   G_2, G_T) are asymmetric bilinear map groups if there exists a
   bilinear map e: (G_1, G_2) -> G_T satisfying the following
   properties:

   1.  Bilinearity: for any S in G_1, for any T in G_2, for any a, b in
       Z_r, we have the relation e([a]S, [b]T) = e(S, T)^{a * b}.

   2.  Non-degeneracy: for any T in G_2, e(S, T) = 1 if and only if S =
       O_E.  Similarly, for any S in G_1, e(S, T) = 1 if and only if T =
       O_E.

   3.  Computability: for any S in G_1, for any T in G_2, the bilinear
       map is efficiently computable.

4.  Optimal Ate Pairing

   This section specifies Optimal Ate Pairing e for c_0, ..., c_l and
   s_i = sum_{j=i}^l c_j * q^j with following conditions

   1.  c_l is not 0

   2.  r is a divisor of s_0

   3.  r^2 is not a divisor of s_0

   4.  r does not divide s_0 * k * q^{k-1} - (q^k - 1)/r * sum_{i=0}^l i
       * c_i * q^{i - 1}

   Section 4.1 shows a guide to decide these parameters c_0, ..., c_l.
   Optimal Ate Pairing is specified below and Miller Loop f which are
   its building blocks are introduced in Section 4.2.  Straight Line
   Function l which is building blocks of Optimal Ate Pairing and Miller
   Loop are defined in Section 4.3.  Section 4.3 only show the
   definitions because its descriptions are based on the form (of the
   PFC?).  Practically, concrete algorithms need to be specified for a
   form of PFC.

   Input:

   o  A point P in G_1

   o  A point Q in G_2

   Output:

   o  The value e(P, Q) in G_T

   Method:

   1.  f = 1

   2.  ln = 1

   3.  for i = 0 to l

          (a) f = f * f_{c_i, Q}^{q^i}(P)

       end for

   4.  for i = 0 to l - 1

          (a) ln = ln * l_{[s_i + 1]Q, [c_i * q^i]Q}(P)

       end for

   5.  return (f * ln)^{(q^k - 1)/r}

4.1.  Guide for Decision on Parameters for Optimal Ate Pairing

   This subsection shows a guide for decision on parameters c_0, ...,
   c_l for Optimal Ate Pairing.  According to [2], a way is to choice
   coefficients of short vector of the following lattice L with a
   minimal number of coefficients as parameters c_0, ..., c_l.

   L = (v_1, ..., v_phi(k)) where

   o  v_1 is column vector t(r, -q, -q^2, ..., -q^{phi(k) - 1})

   o  v_i is column vector whose i component is 1 and other components
      is 0 for i = 2, ..., phi(k)

4.2.  Miller Loop

   In this subsection, we specify Miller Loop f which is building block
   of Optimal Ate Pairing.

   Input:

   o  A point P in G_1

   o  A point Q in G_2

   o  An integer s

   Output:

   o  f_{s, Q}(P)

   Method:

   1.  compute s_0, ..., s_L such that |s| = sum_{j=0}^L s_j * 2^j with
       s_j is in {0, 1} and s_L = 1

   2.  T = Q

   3.  f = 1

   4.  for j = L - 1 down to 0

          (A) Doubling Step

             (a) ln = l_{T, T}(P)

             (b) T = 2 * T

          (B) f = f^2 * ln

          (C) if s_j = 1

             (a) Addition Step

                (i) ln = l_{T, Q}(P)

                (ii) T = T + Q

             (b) f = f' * ln

          end if

       end for

   5.  if s < 0, then f = f^{-1}

   6.  return f

4.3.  Straight Line Function

   Straight Line Function l_{Q, Q'}(P) is calculated by a point P for
   linear equation defined as a line l though points Q, Q'.  Note that
   Straight Line Function l_{Q, Q'}(P) is calculated by a point P for
   linear equation defined as a tangent line to an elliptic curve E at a
   point Q of E on condition that Q = Q'.  The function is used for
   Optimal Ate Pairing in Section 4 and Miller Loop in Section 4.2

5.  Optimal Ate Pairing over BN-curves

   In this section, we specify Optimal Ate Pairing over BN-curves [7].
   BN-curves define over a finite field F_p, and have embedding degree k
   = 12, r(t) = 36 * t^4 + 36 * t^3 + 18 * t^2 + 6 * t + 1, and p(t) =
   36 * t^4 + 36 * t^3 + 24 * t^2 + 6 * t + 1, where t is the specific
   integer in [7].

   The extension fields are defined by following:

      F_{p^2} is set to F_p[u]/(u^2 - e2)

      F_{p^6} is set to F_{p^2}[v]/(u^3 - e6)

      F_{p^12} is set to F_{p^6}[w]/(w^2 - e12)

   The constants e3, e6 and e6 which are varied by G_T are defined in
   [7].

   Hence parameters for Optimal Ate Pairing over D-Type twisted curve
   are following by the method in Section 4.1:

   1.  l = 3

   2.  c_0 = 6 * t + 2

   3.  c_1 = 1

   4.  c_2 = -1

   5.  c_3 = 1

   These short vectors are specified in section 4.  A of [2].

   Algorithm of Optimal Ate Pairing by Miller Loop in Section 4.2 based
   on building blocks specified in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 and
   Straight Line Function f in Section 5.1 over BN-curves is as
   following:

   Method:

   1.  f_1 = f_{c_0, Q}(P)

   2.  l_1 = l_{[p^3]Q}, - [p^2]Q}(P)

   3.  l_2 = l_{[p^3]Q - [p^2]Q, [p]Q}(P)

   4.  l_3 = l_{[p]Q - [p^2]Q + [p^3]Q, [6 * t + 2]Q}

   5.  return (f_1 * l_1 * l_2 * l_3)^{(p^k - 1)/r}

7.  Security Considerations

   The security of cryptographic primitive which is constructed by
   pairing depends on pairing-friendly curves (PFC).  PFC must satisfy
   computational assumption which the primitive requires at the level of
   security strength in system when the primitive is constructed by
   using Optimal Ate Pairing.

Appendix A.  Test Vectors of Optimal Ate Pairing over BN-curves

   In this section, we specify test vectors of optimal ate pairing over
   BN-curves which are specified by [7] in the following way.

   Parameter:

      Pairing-Param-ID is an identifier with which the pairing parameter
      set can be referenced.

   Input:

      P is a point of E in G_1

      Q is a point of E' in G_2

   Output:

      e(P, Q) is computation of pairing in G_T
