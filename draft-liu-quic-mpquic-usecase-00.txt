1.  Introduction

   This draft introduces multipath QUIC use cases.

2.  Use Case 1: Redundant Transmission

   For applications such as Internet live video broadcasting, the user
   experience is very sensitive to delay.  Especially for outdoor
   Internet live video broadcasting, the broadcasting device may equip
   two more cellphone cards to enable stable and robust network
   connection.

   In this case, multipath QUIC can provide redundant transmission over
   multiple network connections to improve user experience.  For
   example, when some broadcasting packets were lost in one network
   connection, the redundant packets can be transmitted immediately by
   another connection without waiting for the timeout of the
   acknowledgements packets.

3.  Use Case 2: bandwidth Aggregation

   For applications such as file download etc., if the device has
   multiple network access, for example, most smart phone today have
   both Wi-Fi and cellular network access, multipath QUIC can be used
   for bandwidth aggregation to accelerate the download speed.

4.  Use Case 3: Use Cases in 5G Core Network

   Use case 3.1: 5GS is required to extend the bandwidth for the
   applications, such as high resolution video streaming.  To achieve
   this purpose, the application is enabled to be access via different
   RAN, for example, different wireless access from PLMNs.  Since 5GS
   can only support multipath for TCP and can not support multipath

   functionality for non-TCP traffic, there is an urgent need for the
   multipath transport protocol for non-TCP traffic.  The traffic
   splitting functionality in 5GS can be further enhanced by adopting
   QUIC with multipath extension, ensuring the bandwidth requirement for
   applications, such as high resolution video streaming.

   The NF (e.g.  UPF) within 5GC may take charge of the QUIC multipath
   extension proxy functionality, which communicate with the multipath
   functionality in the client by using the QUIC multipath extension
   protocol.

   The ongoing discussion on 3GPP SA2 ATSSS R18 study item covers the
   research item and related requirement for the continue study of
   traffic splitting by considering the QUIC with multipath extension.

   10/Docs/S2-2107635.zip

   Use case 3.2: 5GS is required to ensure the reliability and QoE for
   applications, such as live video streaming, video on demand, etc.  To
   achieve this purpose, the application is enabled to be accessed via
   different wireless paths, for example, 5G and Wi-Fi.  However, due to
   the varied wireless environment, the packet sent by one path might be
   lost because of the poor signal and/or wireless interference.  In
   this case, redundant transmission based on multipath is needed for
   guaranteeing reliability and QoE once the performance of the original
   path is deteriorated.  The alternative path(s) may be able to send
   duplicated packets to the client in order to ensure the QoE.

   The NF (e.g.  UPF) within 5GC may take charge of the QUIC multipath
   extension proxy functionality, which communicate with the multipath
   functionality in the client by using the QUIC multipath extension
   protocol.

   3GPP SA2 has an ongoing discussion on ATSSS R18 study item.  The
   redundant steering functionality has been written in the latest
   draft, which reflects the requirement on the redundant transmission.
