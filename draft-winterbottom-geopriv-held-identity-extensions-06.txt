Abstract

   When a Location Information Server receives a request for location
   information (using the locationRequest message), described in the
   base HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) specification, it uses the
   source IP address of arriving message as a pointer to the location
   determination process.  This is appropriate in many environments.
   However, when an entity acting on behalf of the Target would like to
   request location information then the source IP address of the
   request will lead to wrong results.  In other cases the IP address is
   not the only identifier that serves as an input to the location
   determination procedure.

   This document extends the HELD protocol to allow the location request
   message to carry additional identifiers assisting the location
   determination process.  It defines a set of URIs for Target
   identifiers and an XML containment schema.  This extension is used in
   conjunction with HELD to provide Target identification, and set of
   criteria of when to use this extensions are provided.  Examples and
   usage in HELD message syntax are also shown.

1.  Introduction

   Location Configuration Protocols, such as HELD
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery], need to identify a Target
   in order to determine its location.  The base HELD specification only
   provides Target identity through the IP address of the requesting
   Target, while [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps] provides examples of where
   this may be insufficient.  This memo defines a set of URIs and a
   containment schema that allows the entity requesting location
   information to indicate a Target identifier beyond the source IP
   address of the request.

   In addition to a Target providing additional information about itself
   in order to aid location determination, a trusted node can use the
   techniques described in this memo to request location information
   about a specific Target, on behalf of (OBO) that Target.  Use cases
   for this functionality are described in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps]
   and [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] and focus on environments where a call-
   server or proxy resides in the same administrative domain as the LIS,
   and the Target has either failed, or is unable, to provide location
   information when it is required to do so.  This memo provides a set
   of criteria that can be applied by operators considering an OBO-based
   location deployment.

2.  Terminology

   This document reuses the term Target, as defined in [RFC3693].

   This document uses the term Location Information Server, LIS as
   described in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Criteria for using on behalf of location requests

   The general model for acquiring location in the Internet places the
   onus on the end-point to acquire its location prior to invoking a
   service that needs this information in order to operate correctly.
   There is general acceptance from a range of organizations and
   operators that this approach cannot ensure the operation of essential
   services in the short to medium term with current terminal and
   network deployments.  Network operators do not, for the most part,
   control or own user-terminal equipment, which means that they are not
   in a position to ensure essential services will work correctly for
   legacy devices connected to the network and this presents a dilema
   that requires a standarized technical solution.  The accepted
   approach is to have a trusted node be able to request location on-
   behalf-of of the end-point to facilitate the correct operation of
   services deemed essential by the local jurisdiction.  Examples of
   essential services include, but are not limited to ambulance, law
   enforcement, and fire services.

   To support an on-behalf-of location request mechanism there is a need
   for a strong trust relationship between the access and service
   provider entities.  This relationship should exist soley for the
   purposes of providing services considered essential by the
   jurisdiction.  The essential service may be provided inside the local
   access network, placing the access network and service provider in
   same administrative domain.  Alternatively, the essential service is
   provided by a jurisdictional authority that has the right to request
   the location information for a Target in an access network operating
   in its legal boundaries.

   In addition to a strong trust relationship the access and service
   providers need to agree on a Target identifier.  This identifier must
   have the properties of allowing the essential service to identify the
   LIS in the serving access network, and allowing the LIS to identify
   the end-device in the access network.

4.  Identity Extension Details

   This section defines the details of the schema extension for HELD to
   support the inclusion of a Target identity in the form of a URI or
   typed-token.  A set of URI definitions that can be used to specify
   these identities is also provided.

4.1.  URI Definitions

   The URIs defined in this section are designed to identify a Target;
   they do not identify measurements or sighting data associated with a
   Target, such as the switch and port information to which the Target
   is attached.  This information may, for example, be acquired using
   DHCP relay information [RFC3046] or LLDP [LLDP].  Device measurements
   and sighting data are described in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-held-measurements].  The identity provided may
   be transitory, such as an IP address that is leased from a DHCP
   server pool.

   The URIs in the following sub-sections are defined using ABNF
   (augmented Backus-Naur form) described in [RFC2234].

4.1.1.  Ethernet MAC URI

   This is the Ethernet hardware address of the device, and is defined
   as per the IEEE 802 specifications.  The ABNF for this URI type is
   defined as:

   mac-uri = "mac:" 2*2HEXDIG 5*5macdig
   macdig = "-" 2*2HEXDIG

   This type of URI is, for example, used in RFC 4479 [RFC4479].  An
   example of its use is provided in Figure 5.

4.1.2.  IP Address URIs

   This section provides the ABNF for IP version 4 and IP version 6
   URIs.  One application of this URI scheme is described in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-l7-lcp-ps], where an outbound SIP proxy needs to
   make location requests to a LIS on behalf of a Target because, for
   some reason, the necessary information was not provided by the
   Target.

Internet-Draft                 HELD-ID-EXT                     July 2008


   ip-uri = "ip:" ipv4 / ipv6
   ipv4 = "IPv4+" IPv4-Address
   IPv4-Address = 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT
   ipv6 = "IPv6+" hexpart [ ":" IPv4-Address ]
   hexpart =  hexseq / hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] / "::" [ hexseq ]
   hexseq  =  hex4 *( ":" hex4)
   hex4    =  1*4HEXDIG

   An example of a location request including a URI in this form to
   identify the Target device is shown in Figure 3.

   <locationRequest
          xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held" responseTime="8">
     <locationType>geodetic</locationType>
     <deviceIdentity xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id">
       <uri>ip:IPv4+192.0.2.5</uri>
     </deviceIdentity>
   </locationRequest>

            Figure 3: HELD Location Request Using an IP Address

   Note that the URI types are not case sensitive and the iP:ipv4+
   192.0.2.5 is still a valid URI.

4.2.  Schema

   This section defines a schema that is used to provide Target
   identifiers in a HELD location request.

   The schema provided in Figure 4 allows a URI and/or token to be
   provided so that a Target can identify itself by more than just its
   IP address.  The URI can also include an optional "type" attribute so
   that URIs that might otherwise look the same can be distinguished
   based on their usage.

   For example <uri type="gruu">sip:callee@example.com</uri> or <uri
   type="aor">sip:callee@example.com</uri>

   An IANA registry is established for defining uri token types, and
   this defined in Section 6.4.

   When the <identifier> element is used the "type" attribute is
   mandatory as it tells the LIS or receiving entity how to interpret
   the identifier.  An IANA registry is established for the central
   repository for recognized identifier types.  The set of initial types
   is provided in Section 6.3.

   A HELD location request sent by a device using the schema shown in
   Figure 4 to provide its identity as a MAC URI would look similar to
   Figure 5.

   <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held"
                    responseTime="8">
     <locationType>geodetic</locationType>
     <deviceIdentity xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id">
          <uri>mac:01-ab-34-ef-69-0c</uri>
     </deviceIdentity>
   </locationRequest>

                Figure 5: HELD Location Request URI example

   Similarly a Target identifying itself using its DHCP client
   identifier (DHCP option 61 in [RFC2132]) in a location request to a
   LIS would send something similar to Figure 6.

   <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held"
                    responseTime="8">
     <locationType>geodetic</locationType>
     <deviceIdentity xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id">
          <identifier type="dhcpClientId">035552764</identifier>
     </deviceIdentity>
   </locationRequest>

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Device-provided identity extensions

   Identity extensions proivded by the Target device are commonly
   provided to assist the LIS in location determination.  Where the LIS
   is going to use this information it MUST be verifiable by the LIS,
   the choice to perform this verification or not is left to the
   operator of the service.  A MAC address provided by a target device,
   for example, can be verified by performing a DHCP lease-query based
   described in [RFC4388].  Identity extensions such as tel uris and
   hostnames can be validated using network services such as enum and
   ldap.

   Information that cannot be verified, or is found to be false MUST be
   ignroed by the LIS.

5.2.  On behalf of requests

   The on behalf of mechanism allows the access network provider to
   specify rules for location acqusition for essential local services.
   The requirement to implement and comply with these rules will often
   be outside the control of the access provider with legislation
   mandating adherence.  In such circumstances connectivity to the
   access network by an end-device is an implicit acceptance of these
   usage rules.  Providers of access networks that divulge location in
   an on behalf of manner should provide an indication of this in it
   terms and conditions allowing allowing the user of device the option
   of connecting or not.  Where the network may use on behalf of
   location acqusition for non-essential services, the user of an end-
   device MUST have the option of restricting the divulging of location
   to essential services only.  How this restriction occurs is outside
   the scope of this specification.

   The LIS MUST not accept on behalf of location requests from, or
   divulge location information to, any third-party that it cannot
   authenticate or authorize.  In most cases on behalf of requests
   should be restricted to essential services legislated by the local
   juridiction.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers an XML namespace and schema with IANA in
   accordance with guidelines in [RFC3688].  It also creates a new
   registry for device identity types, and stipulates how new types are
   to be added.

6.1.  URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id

   This section registers a new XML namespace,
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:id", as per the guidelines in
   [RFC3688].

6.3.  Identifier 'type' Attribute values

   This document requests that the IANA create a new registry for
   identifier 'type' attribute values.  These are text strings that
   clarify how the value identifies the Device.  Referring to [RFC2434]
   this registry operates under the "Expert Review" rule.

   The following identifier types are registered as part of this memo:

   o  'dhcpClientId' The DHCP client identifier as defined by DHCP
      option 61 in [RFC2132]

   o  'msisdn' The Mobile Station International Subscriber Dial Number.
      This is an E.164 number made up of 6 to 15 digits

   o  'imsi' The International Mobile Subscriber identifier.  A unique
      identifier for GSM or UMTS mobile terminal made up of 6 to 15
      digits that identify the country code, the network code and
      device.

   o  'imei' The International Mobile Equipment identifier.  This is an
      electronic serial number for a mobile device and is consists of up
      to 15 digits

   o  'min' Mobile Identification Number.  A unique equipment identifier
      assigned to CDMA handsets.

   o  'mdn' Mobile Dial Number.  An E.164 number made up of 6 to 15
      digits.

   o  'hostname' The hostname or FQDN of the device.

   o  'directoryNumber' The directory number of the device.

6.4.  URI Type Attribute Values

   This document requests that the IANA create a new registry for uri
   'type' attribute values.  These are text strings that clarify what a
   URI actually identifies, and MUSt include the URI scheme to which the
   type applies.  Referring to [RFC2434] this registry operates under
