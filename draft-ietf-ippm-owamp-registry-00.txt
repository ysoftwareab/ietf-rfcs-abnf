     Registries for the One-Way Active Measurement Protocol - OWAMP
                   draft-ietf-ippm-owamp-registry-00

Abstract

   This memo describes the registries for OWAMP - the One-Way Active
   Measurement Protocol.  The registries allow assignment of MODE bit
   positions and OWAMP Command numbers.  The memo also requests that
   IANA establish the registries for new features, called the OWAMP-
   Modes registry and the OWAMP Control Command Number registry.

1.  Introduction

   The One-way Active Measurement Protocol, OWAMP [RFC4656] was prepared
   to support measurements of metrics specified by the IP Performance
   Metrics (IPPM) working group in the IETF.  The Two-Way Active
   Measurement Protocol, TWAMP [RFC5357] is an extension of OWAMP.  The

   TWAMP specification gathered wide review as it approached completion,
   and the by-products were several recommendations for new features in
   TWAMP.  As a result, a registry of new features was established for
   TWAMP.  However, there were no new features proposed for OWAMP until
   recently.

   This memo establishes the needed registries for OWAMP, and updates
   [RFC4656].

2.  Purpose and Scope

   The purpose and scope of this memo is to describe and request the
   establishment of registries for future OWAMP [RFC4656] extensions.
   IANA already administrates the "Two-way Active Measurement Protocol
   (TWAMP) Parameters", and this request follows a similar form (with
   one exception identified below).

   This memo also provides the initial contents for the registries.

3.  IANA Considerations for OWAMP Control Registries

   OWAMP-Control protocol coordinates the measurement capability.  All
   OWAMP-Control messages follow specifications defined in section 3 of
   [RFC4656].

3.1.  Control Command Number Registry

   IANA is requested to create a OWAMP-Control Command Number registry.

   OWAMP-Control Commands follow specifications defined in section 3.4
   of [RFC4656].

3.1.1.  Registry Specification

   OWAMP-Control Commands Numbers are specified in the first octet of
   OWAMP-Control-Client command messages consistent with section 3 of
   [RFC4656].  There are a maximum of 256 command numbers.

3.1.2.  Registry Management

   Because the "OWAMP-Control Command Numbers" registry can contain only
   256 values, and because OWAMP is an IETF protocol, these registries
   must be updated only by "IETF Consensus" as specified in [RFC5226]
   (an RFC that documents registry use and is approved by the IESG).

3.1.3.  Experimental Numbers

   One experimental value is currently assigned in the Command Numbers
   Registry, as indicated in the initial contents below.

3.1.4.  OWAMP-Control Command Numbers Initial Contents

   OWAMP-Control Commands follows the procedure defined in section 3.5
   of [RFC4656] (and in the remainder of section 3).

   The complete set of OWAMP-Control Command Numbers are as follows
   (including one reserved bit position):

      OWAMP-Control Command Numbers Registry

      Value  Description             Semantics Definition
       0      Reserved
       1      Request-Session         RFC 4656, Section 3.5
       2      Start-Sessions          RFC 4656, Section 3.7
       3      Stop-Sessions           RFC 4656, Section 3.8
       4      Fetch-Sessions          RFC 4656, Section 3.9
       5      Experimentation         This Memo
       6-255  Unassigned


3.2.  OWAMP-Modes

   IANA is requested to create a OWAMP-Modes registry.

3.2.1.  Registry Specification

   OWAMP-Modes are specified in OWAMP Server Greeting messages and Set-
   up Response messages consistent with section 3.1 of [RFC4656].  Modes
   are currently indicated by setting single bits in the 32-bit Modes
   Field.  However, more complex encoding may be used in the future.

3.2.2.  Registry Management

   Because the "OWAMP-Modes" are based on only 32 bit positions with
   each position conveying a unique feature, and because TWAMP is an
   IETF protocol, these registries must be updated only by "IETF
   Consensus" as specified in [RFC5226] (an RFC that documents registry
   use and is approved by the IESG).

Internet-Draft              TWAMP Extensions                   July 2015


3.2.3.  Experimental Numbers

   No experimental bit positions are currently assigned in the Modes
   Registry, as indicated in the initial contents below.

3.2.4.  OWAMP-Modes Initial Contents

   OWAMP-Control connection establishment follows the procedure defined
   in section 3.1 of [RFC4656].

   In the OWAMP-Modes registry, assignments are straightforward on the
   basis of bit positions, and there are no references to values - this
   is a difference from the comparable TWAMP registry (and a topic for
   improvement in the TWAMP-Modes registry).

   An Extension of the OWAMP-Modes is proposed in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ipsec].
   With this extension, the complete set of OWAMP Mode bit positions are
   as follows (including one reserved bit position):

   OWAMP-Modes Registry

   Bit
   Posit.  Description            Reference/Explanation
   0      Unauthenticated         RFC4656, Section 3.1
   1      Authenticated           RFC4656, Section 3.1
   2      Encrypted               RFC4656, Section 3.1
   3      Reserved                bit position (3)
   4      IKEv2-derived Shared    RFC_TBD and this memo
          Secret Key              new bit position (4)
   5-31   Unassigned


   In the original OWAMP and TWAMP Modes field, setting bit position 0,
   1 or 2 indicated the security mode of the Control protocol, and the
   Test protocol inherited the same mode (see section 4 of [RFC4656]).

   The value of the Modes Field sent by the Server in the Server-
   Greeting message is the bit-wise OR of the modes (bit positions) that
   it is willing to support during this session.  Thus, the last four
   bits of the Modes 32-bit Field are used.  When no other features are
   activated, the first 28 bits MUST be zero.  A client conforming to
   this extension of [RFC5357] MAY ignore the values in the first 28
   bits of the Modes Field, or it MAY support other features that are
   communicated in these bit positions.

   OWAMP and TWAMP registries for Modes may grow to contain different
   features and functions due to the inherent differences in one-way and
   two-way measurement configurations and the metrics they measure.  No

   attempt will be made to coordinate them unnecessarily, except the
   Reserved bit position 3 above.  This is available for assignment if a
   mixed security mode [RFC5618] is defined for OWAMP, and would allow
   alignment with the comparable TWAMP feature.

4.  Security Considerations

   As this memo simply requests creation of a registry, it presents no
   new security or privacy issues for the Internet.

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live networks are relevant here as well.  See [RFC4656] and
   [RFC5357].

   Privacy considerations for measurement systems, particularly when
   Internet users participate in the tests in some way, are described in
   [I-D.ietf-lmap-framework].
