1.  Introduction

   What would a "completely virtual" IETF meeting look like?  What would
   be issues?  What would be the advantages?  How could it work?

   The "manycouches" design team was convened to explore these issues
   and understand what might be involved in holding a completely virtual
   meeting.  On 20 July 2017, members met with the IESG for a joint
   discussion at the IETF 96 meeting in Berlin.  This document outlines
   many of the key issues and questions for discussion that emerged out
   of that Berlin meeting as well as mailing list conversations.

Internet-Draft   Thoughts on Completely Virtual Meetings    October 2016


   Discussions identified two types of potential meetings the IETF could
   have that would be completely virtual:

   1.  PLANNED VIRTUAL MEETING - A "regular" meeting of the IETF that
       would be planned to be completely virtual.

   2.  EMERGENCY VIRTUAL MEETING - There could be a situation where a
       planned physical meeting suddenly needs to be virtual due to
       physical or political situations.  For example, a natural
       disaster shortly before a meeting might cause people to not be
       able to attend.

   Tools and processes may be very similar between the two types of
   meetings.  A key difference is that for an "emergency" meeting there
   may be the desire to replicate the planned schedule of the physical
   meeting as closely as possible.

   It is unclear if the IETF might ever choose to hold a planned virtual
   meeting, but this document is designed to facilitate the discussion
   around what that might look like.

1.1.  Benefits

   Proponents of planned virtual meetings point to benefits such as:

   o  No requirement to travel, removing an economic issue for many.

   o  All participants are on an equal footing (versus current situation
      where physical participants have more interaction capability than
      remote attendees).

   o  Ability to think differently about how the schedule of the meeting
      might look.

   The sections below outline many of the questions and ideas, some of
   which may be benefits.

1.2.  Challenges

   There are many challenges with hosting a completely virtual meeting.
   Some key issues are:

   o  Inability to have the "high bandwidth" conversations enabled by
      face-to-face meetings.

   o  No ability to have "hallway conversations" and casual meetings
      with other participants.

   The remainder of the document outlines many of the challenges and
   associated questions.

   Several participants voiced the opinion that replacing a physical
   meeting would be pretty much impossible.

1.3.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Additionally, the key words "*MIGHT*", "*COULD*", "*MAY WISH TO*",
   "*WOULD PROBABLY*", "*SHOULD CONSIDER*", and "*MUST (BUT WE KNOW YOU
   WON'T)*" in this document are to interpreted as described in RFC 6919
   [RFC6919].

2.  Program

2.1.  Meeting Structure

   With a completely virtual meeting, the structure of the meeting does
   not have to comply with the traditional IETF meeting schedule.  It
   could, for instance, stretch out over the entire 24 hours of a day.
   Questions for discussion include:

   o  Is the meeting still structured over a week?

   o  Do the meetings still exist within certain hours?

   o  Do multiple meetings exist at the same time as they do now?

   Again, in the case of an unplanned "emergency" virtual meeting the
   desire may be to stick with the already-planned schedule.  But for a
   planned virtual meeting the schedule can be open for discussion.

   There was some discussion that a meeting could span more than the
   traditional week.  However, the counterpoint is that keeping it
   within a week gives a focused block of time that people could
   allocate for participation in the virtual event.

2.2.  Timezones

   What timezone does a virtual meeting operate in?  Or does it operate
   in multiple timezones?

   One suggestion was that each working group might choose its own
   timezone based on the best timezone for the main contributors and

   leaders.  (Although this might then limit participation from other
   areas of the world.)

2.3.  Deadlines

   What do deadlines look like for a completely virtual meeting?  Are
   the deadlines for agendas and drafts kept as they are for a regular
   meeting?

2.4.  Plenaries

   What does a plenary look like in a virtual meeting?  The same large
   session as today?

3.  User Journey / Experience

3.1.  Participating in multiple sessions

   It is currently possible for remote participants to join into
   multiple working group sessions at the same time.  Users simply run
   Meetecho in multiple browser windows or multiple computers.  How does
   this impact users' experience?

3.2.  Side meetings

   It is quite common for groups to decide during an IETF meeting to go
   off and have a side meeting.

   o  How can this capability be reproduced in a virtual environment?

   o  Could the system allow people to create ad hoc meetings in some
      fashion?

3.3.  Hallway conversations

   The casual hallway conversations are a key component of IETF physical
   meetings.  How can some version of this capacity be made available?

3.4.  Unstructured time

   How do you incorporate some concept of "unstructured" time where
   people can meet and connect?

3.5.  Serendipity - discovering other users

   Part of a physical meeting involves discovering other people with
   common interests or backgrounds.  How do you help people find others?

3.6.  Microphone lines

   How do "mic lines" work in a completely virtual meeting?  Would this
   in fact be a benefit as all attendees would be in the same queue?

3.7.  Mentoring

   How would the "mentor" program work in a virtual meeting?  The same
   as with a physical meeting?

3.8.  Inclusivity

   How do you bring new people into sessions?  How do people learn about
   side meetings?  About hallway conversations?

4.  Technical Considerations

   Many technical questions need to be discussed.

4.1.  Infrastructure

   What is the infrastructure used to host a completely virtual meeting?
   Are current systems such as Meetecho sufficient?  Would new
   infrastructure need to be established?

   What kind of bandwidth would need to be available?

4.2.  Capabilities

   Do virtual attendees have video connections? voice? chat?

4.3.  Network Operation Center (NOC)

   Where does the NOC "exist" for a completly virtual meeting?  What is
   its role?

5.  Administrative

5.1.  Centralized Resources

   What is the impact of a virtual meeting on centralized resources such
   as support staff?  What is the full role of the Secretariat during
   the meeting?

5.2.  Finances

   o  What would the impact be on IETF finances?

   o  Would we charge the same amount to attendees as a regular meeting?

6.  Security Considerations

   There are many considerations related to security and privacy that
   need to be factored in to a virtual meeting.

6.1.  Availability

   How do we ensure that an attack such as a distributed denial of
   service (DDoS) doesn't take out the entire virtual meeting?  What
   about an attack against a particular region?

6.2.  Integrity

   How do you know that the person who is logged into whatver system is
   used is in fact who they say they are?  In a physical meeting:

   o  We can see the person and physically identify them.

   o  Users wear name badges that were issued at registration time.

   o  There are typically other people who may know many individuals.

   How are these physical considerations replicated in a virtual
   meeting?

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations associated with this document.
