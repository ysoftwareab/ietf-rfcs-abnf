Abstract

   Today there is no support in the RSVP protocol to dynamically signal
   the enabling and configuring of the BFD (Bi-directional Forwarding
   Detection) on a backup path.  This document introduces a new RSVP
   object called "FRR backup BFD object".  The procedures described in
   this document are only applicable to Fast Reroute LSPs [RFC4090].

1. Introduction

   This document proposes a new RSVP object called "FRR backup BFD
   object".  This object is carried in the RSVP PATH message [RFC2205]
   to establish an MPLS LSP tunnel.  This new object carries information
   to enable and configure the BFD for Fast Reroute (FRR) backup tunnels
   on the transit LSRs, which are also called Point of Local Repair
   (PLR).  The procedures described in this document are only applicable
   to Fast Reroute LSPs [RFC4090].

   When a Fast Reroute LSP is signaled using RSVP, its associated backup
   path configuration information is carried in the Fast Reroute object
   [RFC4090].  Each Transit PLR uses this information to establish the
   backup path that protects the protected path.  The Fast Reroute

   object does not carry any configuration information to establish the
   BFD for MPLS LSPs [BFDMPLS] for backup path LSPs.  In order to signal
   the BFD configuration information for the Fast Reroute backup LSPs, a
   new RSVP object called FRR backup BFD object has been suggested.

2. FRR Backup BFD Object

   The new RSVP FRR_BACKUP_BFD object will have the following form:


                0             1             2             3
         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
         |       Length (bytes)      |  Class-Num  |   C-Type    |
         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
         |             BFD Detection Time Multiplier             |
         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
         |             BFD Desired Min TX interval (usec)        |
         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
         |             BFD Desired Min RX Interval (usec )       |
         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

    An optional Authentication Section may be present:

         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
         |Auth Type    | Auth Len    | Authentication Data ...   |
         +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+


   Length
     Length of the TLV in bytes.

   Class-Num
     To be assigned by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) [ENT].

   C-Type
     1

   Detection Time Multiplier
     Number of consecutive BFD control packets to be missed before
     declaring the BFD session down on a backup path.

   Desired Min TX interval:
     Minimum transmit interval (in microseconds) for BFD control packets
     on a backup path.

   Desired Min RX Interval:

     Minimum receive interval (in microseconds) for BFD control packets
     on a backup path.

   Authentication Type, Authentication Len, and Authentication Data are
   as described in draft-ietf-bfd-base-09.txt [BFD].


3. RSVP-TE Protocol Operation

   When the BFD configuration is desired on a backup path of the Fast
   Reroute LSP, the ingress LSR MUST include the FRR BACKUP BFD object
   in the RSVP PATH message.  The following lists the suggested
   operation an LSR should implement when processing the FRR BACKUP BFD
   object.

   1. The presence of a FRR_BACKUP BFD object in a PATH message allows
      enabling and configuring BFD dynamically on a backup path on any
      PLR.  A PLR is either ingress or a transit node in an FRR
      protected path.

   2. A PLR should enable the BFD on a backup path when it first detects
      the FRR backup BFD object in the PATH message.

   3. The changes in the FRR_BACKUP_BFD object in subsequent PATH
      messages will be reflected to the configuration accordingly.

   4. The absence of the FRR_BACKUP_BFD object (after it had been
      detected once) will indicate disabling of the BFD on an FRR backup
      path.  The receiving LSR MUST then disable the BFD on its
      respective backup path.

   5. The FRR_BACKUP_BFD object MUST be ignored if local protection is
      not enabled on an RSVP LSP.

   6. The local protection can be of any form (either one-to-one or
      facility backup) The FRR_BACKUP_BFD object facilitates the BFD
      configuration on a dynamically established backup path.

   7. FRR_BACKUP_BFD object should be ignored by the receiving LSR if it
      does not support it.  However, the LSR MUST forward this object
      unchanged to the next downstream LSR.

4. Conventions used in this document

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

5. Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security issues above those
   identified in [RFC3209] and [RFC4090].

6. IANA Considerations

   This document introduces a new RSVP object to be carried in an RSVP
   PATH message.  The object class number "Class-Num" needs to assigned
   by IANA.
