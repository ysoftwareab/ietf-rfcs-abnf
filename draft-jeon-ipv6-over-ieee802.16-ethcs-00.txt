1.  Introduction

   TBD


2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   Description of following some terms is taken directly from [IEEE
   802.16] and [IEEE 802.16e].

   Base Station (BS):  A generalized equipment set providing
      connectivity, management, and control of the subscriber station.

   Subscriber Station (SS):  A generalized equipment set providing
      connectivity between subscriber equipment and a base station.

   Service-specific Convergence Sublayer (CS):  Sublayer in IEEE 802.16
      MAC layer which classifier external network data and associates
      them to the proper MAC service flow identifier and connection
      identifier.

   Connection Identifier (CID):  A 16 bit value that identifies a
      connection to equivalent peers in the MAC of the base station and
      subscriber station.

   Source SS:  SS which initiates IPv6 NDP message.

   Target SS:  SS which is identified with target field in IPv6 NDP
      message.

   Source BS:  BS where Source SS is located.

   Target BS:  BS where Target SS is located.

   Dynamic Service Addition (DSA):  The set of messages and protocols
      that allow the base station and subscriber station to add the
      characteristics of a service flow.

Internet-Draft      IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Ethernet CS           Sep 2006


   Multicast and Broadcast Services:  Globally defined service flow that
      carries broadcast or multicast information towards a plurality of
      SS.

   Multicast and Broadcast Services Connection ID (MBS-CID):  Traffic
      CID for MBS.

   Common Connection Identifier (CCID):  CID shared by all SSs and BS
      for the purpose of transmitting IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages
      with all-node multicast address.



4.  Assumption

   This document supposes following assumption.

   o  All SSs attached to same AR share one or multiple prefixes so that
      multiple BSs and SSs form an IPv6 subnet.  All MSs attached to
      different BSs under the same AR, can be on same IPv6 link

   o  IEEE 802.16 BS supports local realy function.  In general, MAC
      Bridge does not relay incoming packet to its incoming port again.
      Hence, IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages cannot be transmitted to
      other SSs served by same BS without local relay function.  This
      document supposes IEEE 802.16 BS relays the IPv6 Neighbor
      Discovery messages before delivering them to MAC Bridge.



5.  IEEE 802.16 Network Model on IPv6 over Ethernet CS

   IEEE 802.16 access technology is different from existing wireless
   access technologies such as IEEE 802.11 or 3G, because IEEE 802.16
   only defines the encapsulation of an IP packet into an IEEE 802.16
   MAC payload without a complete description of IPv6 operation.  Also,
   the existence of various Convergence Sublayers (CS) introduces
   various IEEE 802.16 based network deployment architecture.  This
   document discusses possible deployment scenarios in case of VLAN CS
   as well as Ethernet CS.

   Figure 1 shows IEEE 802.16 network deployment scenario with direct
   host-to-host communication.  In this scenario, a BS is separated from
   an access router, there exist multiple access routers in a link, and
   a subnet consists of multiple BSs and SSs.  In addition to that,
   there may exist a network behind SS/Gateway, i.e.  Wireless DSL
   equipment.  The network behind SS/Gateway can support various access
   network technologies such as 802.11, Ethernet, and so on.

   Ethernet links BSs to ARs and they are connected via Ethrenet
   Swithch.  In this scenario, SS and BS utilize VLAN CS as well
   Ethernet CS and VLANs comprise SSs attached to several BSs.  When the
   VLANs are deployed, direct host-to-host communication is available.
   Thus, IP features such as multi-homing and native multicasting can be
   easily supported.

   Figure 2 shows the case attaching SSs over Ethernet CS without direct
   host-to-host communication.  In general public access case, direct
   communication between hosts is restricted because of security issue,
   such as attacks by malicious users.

   In this case, connections from SS are extended from the BS to the AR.
   The extension can be achieved by using GRE tunnel with CID
   granularity.

6.  Transmission on IPv6 over Ethernet CS

6.1.  On-Link Issue

   The assignment of a common prefix to all SSs under a specific AR
   means locating them "on-link" in terms of IP packet transfer.
   According to [I-D.ietf-ipv6-2461bis], IP node performs a longest
   prefix match against the prefix list in order to decide whether the
   destination of the IP packet is on-link or not.  Therefore, SSs
   sharing a prefix can be said to on-link IP nodes.

   Section 5 says that direct communication among SSs is depending on
   the type of IEEE 802.16 network model scenario.  Above the second
   scenario does not support direct communication between SSs and it
   results in the problem of locating SSs on-link in terms of IP packet
   transfer.

   By the way, VLAN in the first scenario allows each SSs to communicate
   each other directly.  Therefore, all IPv6 NDP messages can be
   exchanged between SSs and there is no On-Link issue.

   This document considers behaviors in the first scenario.  First
   scenario will be handled in next version of document.

6.2.  Frame Format

   [IEEE802.16e] defines several CSs for carrying upper layer data.
   Currently, IP CS and Ethernet CS is defined to transport packet-based
   protocols.  IPv6 packets can be transmitted in IEEE 802.16 Generic

   o  CRC: An optional 4 octets field (refer to Section 6.3.3.5 in [IEEE
      802.16].  CRC appended to the PDU after encryption.

6.3.  Maximum Transmission Unit

   Since IEEE 802.16 provides link layer fragmentation and reassembly
   function, the MTU for IEEE 802.16 link is not specified in
   [IEEE802.16].  However, in the Ethernet CS deployment model, BSs and
   ARs may be connected via Ethernet.  Therefore, a value of 1500 octets
   is recommended for the MTU of the IPv6 packets in order to keep
   compatibility with Ethernet.

   Note that the value does not consider where stacked VLANs are
   tranferred over the air and GRE tunnel is established between BS and
   AR.  Deployment scenario considering above situation should consider
   additional sizes by VLAN header and GRE header.


7.  IPv6 NDP Operations on IPv6 over Ethernet CS

7.1.  Identification Cache Table

   BS maintains Identification Cache Table (ICT), which includes
   information on SSs covered by the BS.  The ICT contains MAC address,
   IPv6 address of SS, and DAD flag.  If DAD flag is set, the ICT should
   include tentative target address in DAD Neighbor Solicitation (NS).
   The ICT should be preferable co-located with the bridging table.  The
   ICT is constructed by following operations.

   o  BS can learn L2 address of SS during the initial ranging procedure
      of IEEE 802.16 specified in Section 6.3.1.1 in [IEEE 802.16].
      (Note that this approach may be not sufficient if there are
      multiple hosts connected behind a MAC bridge on SS.  We need a
      reliable mechanism also to learn MAC addreesses behind the SS.)

   o  BS can learn L3 address of SS with Target field in DAD NS which is
      not responded with DAD NA.  (NOTE: it seems unreliable.  We have
      to look for another method, not using DAD NS/NA)


7.2.  Router Discovery, Prefix Discovery and Parameter Discovery

   Router Discovery, Prefix Discovery and Parameter Discovery procedures
   are achieved by receiving Router Advertisement (RA) message.  The RA
   is advertised by using all-node multicast transmission.  If IEEE
   802.16 does not support IPv6 multicast transmission, the multicast
   transmission should be emulated with the way described in Section



Jeon, et al.              Expires March 5, 2007                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      IPv6 over IEEE 802.16 Ethernet CS           Sep 2006


   7.5.2.

   Considering the power consumption on SS, we recommend that AR should
   just unicast the RA in response with RS without using all-node
   multicast transmission.  It can prevent SS from frequently being
   woken in idle mode.

   There can be drawbacks caused by the non-periodic RA messages.  We
   will consider the drawbacks in next version of doucment.

7.3.  Address Resolution

   When Source SS sends NS for Address Resolution, MAC bridge function
   on Source BS relays the NS toward backbone Ethernet link.  Each BSs
   attached the backbone receive the NS and identify Target BS for the
   NS by referring its own ICT.  Other BSs, not Target BS, ignore the
   NS.

   If network approves the proxy function for NDP, Target BS refers the
   ICT and responds to the NS instead of Target SS.

   Otherwise, Target BS relays the NS message toward its own air using
   replicated unicast mechanism specified in Section 7.5.1.  Target SS
   responds to the NS.

7.4.  Duplicate Address Detection

   When Source BS receive DAD NS from Source SS, the Source BS set DAD
   flag in ICT to non-zero and store tentative address in Target Address
   field in DAD NS so that it can identify who sends the DAD NS.  MAC
   bridge on Source BS relays the DAD NS toward backbone Ethernet link.
   Each BSs attached the backbone receive the DAD NS and identify Target
   BS for the DAD NS by referring its own ICT.  Other BSs, not Target
   BS, ignore the DAD NS.

   If network approves the proxy function for NDP, Target BS refers the
   ICT to see whether the tentative target address in the DAD NS exists
   in its own ICT table.  If it exists, Target BS responds with DAD NA.
   Otherwise, discard the DAD NS message silently.

   If the proxy function is not available, Target BS relays the DAD NS
   message toward its own air using replicated unicast mechanism
   specified in Section 7.5.1.  If the tentative target address is in
   use, Target SS responds with DAD NA.  Otherwise, the DAD NS message
   is ignored.

   When each BSs receive the DAD NA message, the BSs refer to DAD flag
   and tentative target address in ICT table to see whether Source SS is

   located in its serving area.  If existing, the BS sends the DAD NA
   using Common CID specified in Section 7.5.2.

7.5.  IPv6 NDP Multicast Transmission

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages except Redirect are destined to
   link-local scoped multicast address such as all-router multicast
   address, all-node multicast address, and solicited-node multicast
   address.

   Since IEEE 802.16 specification does not provide dedicated CIDs for
   IPv6 multicast packet transmission, any available traffic CID value
   needs to be allocated for multicasting IPv6 packet.

   Following subsections describe how to transmit the packets with link-
   local scoped multicast address into IEEE 802.16 network according to
   different type of link-local scoped multicast address.

7.5.1.  Solicited-node Multicast Transmission using Replicated Unicast

   In the wireless environment, it is important to avoid all-node
   multicast transmission in order to prevent unrelated SSs from
   frequently being woken from idle mode.

   Solicited-node multicast address is not for all nodes and can be seen
   a pseudo-unicast.  Hence, we can leave the above situation out of
   consideration when using solicited-node multicasting.

   Replicated Unicast is to deliver IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages by
   repeated unicast transmissions towards SSs involved in the multicast
   address of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery message.

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages with solicited-node multicast
   address should be transmitted by replicated unicasts via CIDs of
   corresponding SSs.  Thus, it is required to identify CIDs for
   solicited-node multicast addresses.

   Section 6.3.1.1 in [IEEE 802.16] states that a 48-bit universal MAC
   address of SS is used during the initial ranging process to identify
   connections to SS.  Solicited-node multicast address of SS can be
   derived by the MAC address.  As a result, BS can be aware of the
   solicited-node multicast addresses with the known MAC address of each
   SS and match the derived addresses with each CIDs.  (Note that we
   need further consideration to obtaining MAC addresses of multiple
   hosts behind a SS.)

7.5.2.  All-node Multicast Transmission using Common CID

   This section defines Common CID (CCID) for transmitting all-node
   multicast data.  There is one unique CCID in BS and it is shared by
   all SSs served by the BS.  All SSs can receive data transmitted via
   the CCID.

   Current IEEE 802.16 does not specify CID which can be shared by all
   SSs and used for IP data.  Following describes how to make CCID with
   existing MBS-CID.

   [IEEE 802.16e] proposes Multicast and Broadcast Service (MBS), which
   presents media service to SSs using multicast or broadcast.  Under
   MBS architecture, each SS selects MBS contents and then configures a
   corresponding CID by the DSA procedure.  Such a CID for MBS is
   referred to as MBS-CID.  MBS-CID is one of transport CIDs and is
   shared by all SSs requesting same media content.

   CCID can be seen as a special type of MBS-CID.  CCID is allocated to
   BS and all SSs served by the BS utilizing a general DSA procedure in
   MBS for transmitting link-local multicast data.  For the assigning
   the CCID, we assume that service flow for all-node multicast is
   globally defined and the service flow is known to BS and all SSs.
   Once initialization between BS and SS is completed, they perform DSA
   procedure for creating the all-node multicast service flow.  The
   detailed process creating new service flow and updating CS for
   mapping of the service flow to CCID is outside scope of this
   document.

   BS transmits IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages with all-node multicast
   address towards all SSs via the CCID.


8.  Security Considerations

   IEEE 802.16e architecture supports a number of mandatory
   authorization mechanisms such as EAP-TTLS, EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA.

   [RFC 3971] specifies security mechanisms for NDP and defines securing
   NDP messages.
