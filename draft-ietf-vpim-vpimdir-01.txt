     Internet Draft           VPIM Directory           November 14, 2001 


  1. Abstract 

  2. Scope  

  2.1 Design Goals 

     The VPIM directory Schema (VPIMDIR) is accessed from outside the 
     enterprise or service provider domain using the recipients telephone 
     number. 

  2.2 Performance Constraints 

     Once the identity of the VPIM directory server is known, the email 
     address, capabilities, and spoken name confirmation information can be 
     retreived. This query is expected to use LDAP, a connection-oriented 
     protocol.  The protocol transaction includes multiple packet round-
     trip to execute the query and retreival and is considered to be the 
     most at-risk element of the infrastructure.  Further, retreival of the 
     confirmation information may require the return of a spoken name 
     segment up to 20kbytes (5 seconds at 4kbytes/second).  Over a 
     sufficiently engineered Internet connection, a 1250 ms response time 
     is believed to be achievable over the Internet at large. 

  2.3 Scaling Constraints 

     A service provider's namespace is expected to include entries for tens 
     of million subscribers in a flat namespace based on the VPIM inter-
     domain address form: telephone number@domain_name.  A large 
     corporation may have a hundred-thousand entries while a large service 
     provider may have tens of millions of entries in a single domain.  It 
     is expected that there will be a single public address validation 
     service for a given service providers network.  It is believed that 
     existing directory technology inclusing horizontal scaleability will 
     provide sufficient transaction throughput within the required latency 
     requirements to address this need.  The only fundamental new 
     requirement this application imposes on directory servers beyond 
     similar existing services is the ability to return the recipients 
     spoken name, a record an order of magnitude larger than common textual 
     elements.  Preliminary investigation suggests that storage and 
     retreival of spoken name will not add appreciable latency, however it 
     will add to the need for storage capacity. 

  2.4 Reliability Constraints 

     DNS provides well-documented redundancy and load-ballancing 
     capabilities for the VPIMDIR.  However, the latency requirements to 
     the end-user may not permit client-side fail-over to a secondary 
     server and may require the directory server to be implemented as a 
     high-availablity service.

  3. The VPIM Directory Schema 

     VPIMUser OBJECT-CLASS ::= { 
                AUXILLARY 
                SUBCLASS OF INETPerson 
                MUST CONTAIN  
                      (vPIMrfc822Mailbox, 
                       vPIMtelephoneNumber ) 
                MAY CONTAIN 
                     (vPIMSpokenName $ 
                     vPIMsupportedUABehaviors $ 
                     vPIMSupportedEncodingTypes $ 
                     vPIMTextName $  
                     vPIMextendedAbsenceStatus $ 
                     vPIMMaxMessageSize $ 
                      vPIMsubMailboxes) 
                ID } 

     The vPIMUser is a auxillary object.  

     When present, the vPIMUser may contain information useful to validate 
     that the dialed telephone number corresponds to the intended 
     recipient.  This object may further provide capabilities information 
     and mailbox status information useful to guide composition by the 
     sending user and to set delivery expectations at sending time. 

  3.1 vPIMTelephoneNumber 

     The normal search is for the full E164 form of the telephone number, 
     including any sub-addressing portion. 

     telephoneNumber ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
               WITH SYNTAX    caseIgnoreIA5StringSyntax 
                    (SIZE (1 .. 20)) -- from RFC 1274 
               ID ?? } 

     Example: A north american telephone number with the subaddress of 12 
     would be represented as +12145551212+12 . 

      

  3.2 vPIMrfc822Mailbox 

     The attribute vPIMrfc822Mailbox stores the inter-domain SMTP address    
     of the voice mailbox associated with a given telephone number.  It is 
     defined as a distinct attribute to distinguish it from the 
     rfc822Mailbox attribute that may be used for other purposes. Although 
     it would be preferable to define vPIMrfc822Mailbox as a subtype of 
     rfc822Mailbox, it is defined here as an entirely new attribute because 
     some directory implementations do not support sub-typing. 

     ASN.1 definition: 



     Vaudreuil                Expires 5/14/01                   [Page 5] 



     Internet Draft           VPIM Directory           November 14, 2001 


     vPIMrfc822Mailbox ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
               WITH SYNTAX    caseIgnoreIA5StringSyntax 
                    (SIZE (1 .. 64)) -- from RFC 1274 
               ID ?? } 

     BNF definition:  

     (2.16.840.1.113694.1.2.1.1.2 NAME 'vPIMrfc822Mailbox' 
                  EQUALITY 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.109.114.2 
                  SYNTAX   '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26 {256}') 

  3.3 vPIMSpokenName 

     The vPIMSpokenName attribute is an octet string and should be encoded 
     in 32 kbit/s ADPCM exactly as defined by [32KADPCM]. vPIMSpokenName 
     shall contain the spoken name of the user in the voice of the user. 
     The length of the spoken name segment must not exceed 5 seconds.  
     Private or additional encoding types are outside the scope of this 
     version.  
      
     The ASN.1 definition for X.500 implementations is: 
      
          vPIMSpokenName ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
               WITH SYNTAX              OCTET STRING 
                                   (SIZE (1..ub-vpim-at-vPIMSpokenName) 
               EQUALITY MATCHING RULE   octetStringMatch 
               ID                  id-vpim-at-vPIMSpokenName } 
          ub-vpim-at-vPIMSpokenName          INTEGER ::= 4000 
      
          The BNF definition for use with LDAP is: 
           
               (2.16.840.1.113694.1.2.1.1.3 NAME 'vPIMSpokenName' 
                EQUAILTY 2.5.13.17 
                SYNTAX '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 {4000}') 

  3.4 vPIMTextName 

     The text name is designed to be consistent with the text name 
     databases used for calling name delivery service of caller ID and when 
     cached may be used for address-by-name functions within a telephone 
     user interface. 

     vPIMTextName ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
               WITH SYNTAX  IA5String             
                    (SIZE (1..20)) 
               ID ?? } 

     OPEN ISSUE The character set of this attribute is not yet determined.  

  3.5 vPIMSupportedEncodingTypes 

     The vPIMSupportedEncodingTypes attribute indicates the type(s) of 
     encodings that can be received at the address specified in 
     vPIMrfc822Mailbox.

     Internet Draft           VPIM Directory           November 14, 2001 


     The ASN.1 definition for X.500 implementations is: 

          vPIMSupportedEncodingTypes ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
               WITH SYNTAX              DirectoryString 
               EQUALITY MATCHING RULE   caseIgnoreMatch 
               ID             id-vpim-at-vPIMSupportedEncodingTypes } 

          The BNF definition of vPIMSupportedEncodingTypes for use with 
     LDAP is: 

         (2.16.840.1.113694.1.2.1.1.4 NAME 
                   'vPIMSupportedEncodingTypes' 
                EQUALITY      2.5.13.2 
                SYNTAX   '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15') 

     The allowable values of DirectoryString for this version of the schema 
     are: 

                 audio/32KADPCM 
                  image/tiff 

     Additional publicly defined extensions, registered with IANA as 
     specified in RFC 2048, may be used.  Non-standard and private encoding 
     types must be indicated by prepending the new type name with either 
     "X-" or "x-". 

     The existance of the value "image/tiff" indicates that simple-mode fax 
     is enabled for the mailbox whose address is defined by the 
     vPIMrfc822mailbox attribute. 

  3.6 vPIMextendedAbsenceStatus 

     It is common to have an attribute to indicate to the subscriber 
     whether the recipient is likely to check messages in the near future.  
     This feature called "extended absence" provides an advisory message at 
     sending time.  It is similar in concept to "vacation notices" common 
     for textual email but has it's own cultural and operational nuances. 

     extendedAbsenceStatus ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
             WITH SYNTAX  IA5string  
                    (SIZE (1..10)) 
                  ID ?? } 

     The three values defined are: 

                 "Off", "On", "MsgBlocked" 

     "Off" indicates that the recipient either does not support extended 
     absence or has not set such an indicator. "Off" if the default 
     condition if this attribute is not returned. 

     "On" indicates that the recipient has set an extended absence 
     indicator, but the mailbox is still accepting messages for review at 
     an unspecified future time.

     Internet Draft           VPIM Directory           November 14, 2001 


     "MsgBlocked" indicates that the recipient has set an extended absence 
     indicator and the mailbox is temporarly configured to reject incoming 
     messages.  Messages should not be sent to the recipient if this value 
     is returned in the extendedAbsenceStatus attribute. 

  3.7 vPIMsupportedUABehaviors 

     Internet mail does not provide facilities for the sender to know 
     whether the recipient supports a number of optional features that can 
     be requested or indicated in the RFC822 headers.  This attribute 
     provides a list of the attributes considered optional by VPIM and 
     other vendor-specific attributes that may be supported by the 
     recipient.  If this attribute is not supported, only those attributes 
     listed as manditory in VPIM are assumed to be supported.  Undisclosed 
     behaviors may be indicated in the RFC822 message, however there is no 
     assurance by the receiving system of their support.   

     VPIMSupportedUABehaviors ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
               WITH SYNTAX  IA5String             
                    (SIZE (1..30)) 
               MULTIVALUE 
               ID ?? } 

     The following behaviors: 

                 MessageDispositionNotication 

     The presense of the MessageDispositionNotification value indicates 
     that the recipient will send a MDN in response to an MDN request. 

     These may be further extended without standardization to include 
     proprietary user interface functional extensions.  These proprietary 
     extension values must be prefixed with an X. 

  3.8 Maximum Message Size 

     At the time of composition, the message can be checked for acceptable 
     length using the maximum message size attribute.  Maximum message size 
     is an attribute usually configured by policy of the receiving system, 
     typically in units of minutes.  While ESMTP provides a mechanism at 
     the transport layer to determine if a message is too long, that is an 
     unreliable guide to the composer when multiple encodings, multiple 
     media, or variable bit-rate encodings are supported. 

     The ASN.1 definition for X.500 implementations is: 

          vPIMMaxMessageSize ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
               WITH SYNTAX              NumericString 
               EQUALITY MATCHING RULE   numericStringMatch 
               ID                  id-vpim-at-vPIMMaxMessageSize} 

     The BNF definition for use with LDAP is:

     (2.16.840.1.113694.1.2.1.1.5 NAME 'vPIMMaxMessageSize' 
                EQUALITY      2.5.13.8 
                  SYNTAX   '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.36') 

  3.9 vPIMsubMailbox 

     This attribute indicates the presence of sub-mailboxes for the queried 
     telephone number.  This information may be used to provide a post-dial 
     sub-addressing menu to the sender. 

     subMailbox ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
             WITH SYNTAX  IA5String  
                    (SIZE (1..9999)) 
             MULTIVALUE 
                  ID ?? } 

     The allowable values include a list of submailbox numbers with a 
     numeric range of 1-9999.  The user interface may use this information 
     to prompt the sender to select a sub-mailbox.  Spoken names associated 
     with each sub-mailbox may be individually retrieved by subsequent 
     queries to the recipient's VPIMDIR service. 

  4. Security Considerations 

     The following are known security issues taken into consideration in 
     the definition of this directory service. 

     1) Service provider customer information is very sensitive, especially 
     in this time of local phone competition.  Service providers require 
     the maximum flexibility to protect this data.  Because of the dense 
     nature of telephone number assignments, this data is subject to "go 
     fish" queries via repeated LDAP queries to determine a complete list 
     of current or active messaging subscribers.  To reduce the value of 
     this retreived data, service providers may limit disclosure of data 
     useful for telemarketing such as the textual name and disclose only 
     information useful to the sender such as the recipients spoken name, a 
     data element much harder to auto-process. 

     2) Service providers operate in a regulated environment where certian 
     information about a subscriber must not be disclosed.  Voice Messaging 
     is subject to caller-ID blocking restrictions, restrictions enforced 
     in the telephony network.  No such protection is available on the 
     Internet.  The protection of this data is essential, but is up to the 
     individual service providers to appropriately limit dislosure of this 
     information.

  9. Changes from -00 

     Changes the schema from a structural object to an auxillary object 
     under INETPerson.  This makes the schema more compatible with other 
     related directory applications while potentially reducing performance 
     by changing accesses based on telephone number from directory reads to 
     directory searches. 

     Changes the schema attributes to all be prefixed by vPIM.  This is to 
     reduce the chance of schema collision. 

      

  10. Open Issues 

     Should the submailbox include non-numeric submailboxes as are common 
     in Internet mail? 

     The formal ASN and BNF in this draft is badly broken.  The schema 
     notation requires fixing by someone expert in this domain.  Volunteers 
     are urgently sought by the author.
