1.  Introduction

   Handover is a process by which a mobile node moves from one point of
   attachment to another point of attachment in a network.  This
   handover can be primarily classified into homogeneous and
   heterogeneou handover.  Heterogeneous handover includes movement
   between various types of wireless networks and different
   administrative domains.  Supporting terminal handovers across
   heterogeneous access networks such as CDMA, 802.11 and GPRS is a
   clear challenge, as each access network has different QoS, security
   and bandwidth characteristics.  Similarly movement between two
   different kinds of domains poses a challenge since a mobile will need
   to re-establish authentication and authorization as well in the new
   domain and each administrative domain may or may not have any prior
   security arrangement.  In order to be able to provide an optimized
   handover solution for a heterogeneous handover case, it is essential
   to determine the key functions that contribute to the handover delay.
   Determining these key functions help define the right set of
   mechanism needed to design an optimized handover framework.  In  this
   document, we introduce   the  concept  of  heterogeneous handover,
   illustrate  the key  performance characteristics requirement  for  a
   real-time communication,  cite  alternate scenarios  that represent
   a heterogeneous  handover involving different  access  technologies
   and different  administrative domains.  We discuss several
   challenges, problems  and issues that  give rise  to  handover delay,
   packet  loss and  jitter during  the heterogeneous handover.  These
   issues  and problem sets can  be used as  guidelines while designing
   an optimized heterogeneous handover solution.

2.  Handover Taxonomy

   An access network is defined as the backhaul network that provides
   the first hop or last hop access to the mobile in an end-to-end
   communication system.  When a mobile during an active communication
   session moves from one access network to another access network and
   changes its point of attachment it is subjected to disruption in
   continuity of service.  During the handover, as the mobile changes
   its point-of-attachment in the network a mobile terminal may end up
   communicating using its second interface in the new network, change
   its subnet or domain it is connected to.  Based on the type of
   movement and access network we can primarily define the handover in
   the following ways.  Thus we can define following combination of
   handovers in our analysis.  Primarily these could be categorized as
   A) Inter-subnet and B) Intra-subnet.

   An Inter-subnet Handover can comprise  the following combination of
   handover that fall into category A.

   1) Inter-technology, Inter-domain

   2) Inter-technology, Intra-domain

   3) Intra-technology, Inter-domain

   4) Intra-technology, Intra-domain

   An intra-subnet handover can consist of the following types of
   handover that fall into category B.

   1) Intra-Tech, Intra-domain

   2) Inter-Tech, Intra-domain

   Heterogeneous handover is  a handover that requires authorization for
   acquisition or modification of resources assigned to a mobile and the
   autorization needs interaction with  a central authority in  a
   domain.  In many  cases  an authorization  procedure in  a
   heterogeneous handover  follows an authentication  procedure that
   also requires interaction with a central authority in a domain.  All
   the scenarios A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 B1 and B-2 described above could
   cover the scope of heterogeneous handover.  These will be more clear
   as we describe different types of handoff scenarios in the following
   sections.

                        Figure 1: Handover Taxonomy

   Intra-subnet: When a mobile moves between two radio access networks
   that are part of the same subnet and does not change its layer 3
   identifier (i.e.  IP address), it is called Intra-subnet handover.
   During an intra-subnet handover, the mobile may be subjected to an
   inter-technology handover as well if both the access networks with
   different radio access technologies (e.g.,CDMA, 802.11) belong to the
   same subnet.  However during an intra-subnet and inter-technology
   handover, the L3 identifier of the terminal may change if the
   terminal starts to communicate using an interface that is part of a
   different access network.

   Inter-subnet: A mobile is subjected to an Inter-subnet handover when
   it moves between two different radio access networks that belong to
   two different subnets.  As a result, its L3 identifier (e.g., IP
   address) is changed thus giving rise to a need for any mobility
   management protocol such as Mobile IP [RFC3344], Mobile IPv6
   [RFC3775], SIP-Mobility [SIPMM], HIP [I-D.ietf-hip-base] that can
   take care of the continuity of the existing application.  An Inter-
   subnet handover can be viewed as a super set of all types of handover
   scenarios and may include intra-domain, Inter-domain, Inter-
   technology or Intra-technology handover.  All of these types of
   handovers are described in this document.  Inter-subnet handover
   potentially gives rise to packet loss and jitter because of delay

   associated with transition at layer 2 and layer 3.

   Inter-technology: A mobile may be equipped with multiple interfaces,
   where each interface can support different access technology (802.11,
   CDMA).  A mobile may like to communicate with one interface at any
   time in order to conserve the power.  During the handover the mobile
   may move out of the footprint of one access technology (e.g., 802.11)
   and move into the footprint of a different access technology (e.g.,
   CDMA).  This will warrant switching of the communicating interface on
   the mobile as well.  This type of Inter-technology handover is often
   called as Vertical Handover since the mobile makes moevement between
   two different cell sizes.  A vertical handover can be termed as
   upward vertical handover or downward vertical handover based on the
   direction of movement such as smaller cell to larger cell or vice
   versa [vertical].  A mobile moving from 802.11 network to cellullar
   network can be viewed as upward vertical handover.  An intertechnlogy
   handover may affect the quality-of-service of the multimedia
   communication, since each access network offers different bandwidth.

   Intra-technology: An intra-technology handover is defined when a
   mobile moves between the same type of access technology such as
   between 802.11[a,b,n] and 802.11 [a,b,n] or between CDMA1XRTT and
   CDMA1EVDO.  In this scenario a mobile may be equipped with a single
   interface (with multiple PHY types of the same technology) or with
   multiple interfaces.  An Intra-technology handover may involve intra-
   subnet or inter-subnet movement and thus may need to change its L3
   identifier as it moves.

   Inter-domain: A domain can be defined in several ways.  But for the
   purposes of roaming we define domain as an administrative domain
   which consists of networks that are managed by a single
   administrative entity which authenticates and authorizes a mobile for
   accessing the networks.  An administrative entity may be a service
   provider, an enterprise and any organization.  As a mobile moves
   between two administrative domains, it is also subjected to inter-
   subnet handover, as two different domains are assumed to be part of
   two different subnets.  Thus an Inter-domain handover will by-default
   be subjected to inter-subnet handover and in addition it may be
   subjected to either inter-technology or intra-technology handover.
   Inter-domain handover will be sujected to all the transition steps a
   subnet handover goes through in addition to an authentication
   process.  These extra steps contribute to additional delay on the top
   of delays due to regular subnet handover.

   Intra-domain: When a mobile's movement is confined to movement within
   an administrative domain it is called intra-domain movement.  An
   intra-domain movement may involve intra-subnet, inter-subnet, intra-
   technology and inter-technlogy as well.

3.  Performance Requirements

   In order to provide desirable quality of service for interactive VoIP
   and streaming traffic, one needs to limit the value of end-to-end
   delay, jitter and packet loss to a certain threshold level.  ITU-T
   and ITU-E standards define the acceptable values for these
   parameters.  For example for one-way delay, ITU-T G.114 recommends
   150 ms as the upper limit for most of the applications, and 400 ms as
   generally unacceptable delay.  One way delay tolerance for video
   conferencing is in the range of 200 to 300 ms.  Also if an out-of-
   order packet is received after a certain threshold it is considered
   lost.  References [RFC2679], [RFC2680] and 2681 [RFC2681] describe
   some of the measurement techniques for delay and jitter.

   An end-to-end delay consists of several components, such as network
   delay, operating system (OS) delay, CODEC delay and application
   delay.  Network delay consists of transmission delay, propagation
   delay, queueing delay in the intermediate routers.  Operating System
   related delay consists of scheduling behavior of the operating system
   in the sender and receiver.  CODEC delay is generally caused due to
   packetization and depacketization at the sender and receiver end.
   Application delay is mainly attributed to playout delay that helps
   compensate the delay variation within a network.  End-to-end delay
   and jitter values can be adjusted using proper value of the playout
   buffer at the receiver end.  In case of interactive VoIP traffic,
   end-to-end delay affects the jitter value and is an important issue
   to consider.  During a mobile's frequent handover, transient traffic
   cannot reach the mobile and this contributes to the jitter as well.
   If the end system has a playout buffer, then this jitter is subsumed
   by the playout buffer delay, but otherwise this adds to the delay for
   interactive traffic.  Packet loss is typically caused by congestion,
   routing instability, link failure, lossy links such as wireless
   links.  During a mobile's handover a mobile is subjected to packet
   loss because of its change in attachment to the network.  Thus for
   both streaming traffic and VoIP interactive traffic packet loss will
   contribute to the service quality of the real-time application.
   Number of packets lost is proportional to the delay during handover
   and rate of traffic the mobile is receiving.  Lost packets contribute
   to congestion in case of TCP traffic because of re-transmission, but
   it does not add to any congestion in case of streaming traffic that
   is RTP/UDP based.  Thus it is essential to reduce the packet loss and
   effect of handover delay in any mobility management scheme.

   We provide some instances of performance requirement here.  For
   example, according to ETSI TR 101 [ETSI] a normal voice conversation
   can tolerate up to 2% packet loss.  If a mobile is subjected to
   frequent handover during a conversation, each handover will
   contribute to packet loss for the period of handover.  Thus maximum

   loss during a conversation needs to be reduced to an acceptable
   level.  There is no clear threshold value for packet loss for
   streaming application, but it needs to be reduced as much as possible
   to provide better quality of service to a specific application.

4.  Handover Delay Analysis

   Effects of Heterogeneous handover: We analyze the handover delay
   associated with heterogeneous handover and the factors that
   contribute to this.  As a mobile goes through a heterogeneous
   handover process, it is subjected to handover delay because of the
   rebinding of properties at several layers of the protocol stack.
   There are several common properties that may contribute to the
   rebinding of these layers.  These properties can mostly be attributed
   to things such as access characteristics (e.g., bandwidth, channel
   characteristics), access mechanism (e.g.  CDMA, CSMA/CA, TDMA),
   configuration of layer 3 parameters, re-authentication, re-
   authorization, rebinding of security association at all layers.

   During any handover procedure any multimedia application running
   within a client gets affected because of the delays incurred within
   each of the layers of the protocol stack.  Next we look at every
   layer and analze rebinding of some of these common properties at each
   layers as a client is subjected to heterogeneous handover.

   Layer 2 delay: Depending upon the access type (e.g., 802.11, CDMA),
   the mobile goes through several transition steps, before the new
   layer 2 link is re-established.  As an example an 802.11 link goes
   through the process of scanning, authentication and association
   during the reattachment to the new 802.11 access network.  Similarly
   other access networks such as CDMA and GPRS networks go through a
   series of state transitions during their reasociation to the new
   point of attachment.  Each of these state transitions contributes to
   certain delays as the mobile goes through each of these transition.
   After a new link is established, depending upon type of handover
   scenario, other layers in the protocol need to get rebound.  For
   example in case of intra-technology, intra-subnet handover, there is
   no other layer besides layer 2 that is affected and the handover
   delay is attributed to the delay due to layer 2 transitions only.
   Even in the case of handoff  consisting of intra-domain, intra-
   technology, intra-subnet handoff where there is layer 2 delay only,
   some sort of authorization procedure needs to be performed when
   swithing to the new access network.  The procedure may take more
   steps if layer-2 characteristics such as QoS characteristics are
   different betweeen the old and new access networks than the case
   where layer-2 chatersteristics are the same betweeen the old and new
   access networks.  So the difference of layer-2 characteristics can
   qualify a intra-technology handover as a heterogeneous handover as
   well.  Thus the scenario B-1 may also qualify to be a heterogeneous
   handover.

   Layer 3 delay: A layer 3 transition process goes through several
   steps such as new IP address acquisition, duplicate address



Dutta (Ed.), et al.      Expires April 20, 2006                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft           Heterogeneous Handover             October 2005


   detection, ARP update, and local authentication.  Where a successful
   local authentication allows the mobile to send packets beyond the
   first hop router.  For example in some cases there is some
   authorization process involved even before a new IP address is
   obtained.  Methods of IP address acquisition are different based on
   if it is IPv4, IPv6 and access network is LAN or WAN.  There are
   several protocols such as DHCP, DHCPv6, PPP or stateless
   autoconfiguration that can be used to take care of IP address
   acquisition.  Each of these methods may take different amount of time
   for a layer 3 transition to complete.  After a layer 3 transition is
   complete and layer 3 address is re-established, there are certain
   functions in the upper layer that need to be completed.  These
   include functions such as sending the binding update from the mobile,
   media redirection at the sending host.  Delays incurred due to these
   functioncs can be attributed to transport delay, processing delay at
   the end hosts etc.  In the inter-subnet mobility category which is
   intra-domain a minimal authorization procedure is needed to obtain
   and use the IP address in the new subnet.  But the required steps can
   be minimized if already established security contexts in the domain
   are utilized for the procedure.  But inter-subnet, inter-domain
   mobility may need additional authorization process.

   Application layer delay: In a typical inter-domain mobility scenario
   independent of inter-technology or intra-technology handoff, an
   authentication and authorization procedure would need to be executed
   for establishing layer 2 and layer 3 properties from scratch in the
   new domian.  This can be an extraordinally undesired delay component
   during handoff.  References [multinetwork], [hybrid], [interdomain]
   are few examples of inter-subnet handover involving inter-domain
   mobility that provide some case studies.  If the inter-subnet
   handover involves inter-domain mobility, then the delay introduced
   due to authentication and authorization procedure adds to the
   handover latency and consequently affects the ongoing multimedia
   sessions.  The authentication and authorization procedure may include
   EAP authentication where an AAA server may be involved in EAP
   messaging during the handover.  Depending upon the type of
   architecture, in some cases the AAA signals traverse all the way to
   the AAA server in the home domain of the mobile as well before the
   network service is granted to the mobile in the new network.  Thus it
   is desirable that interactions between the mobile and AAA servers
   must be avoided or be reduced during the handover.  By way of
   expedited registrations, these interaction can be reduced.  But it is
   more desirable if these can be avoided altogether during the handover
   itself.

5.  Optimizing Handover Delay

   Optimizing the handover delays: Thus it is evident that a mobile is
   subjected to different amount of delay based on the types of handover
   it is subjected to.  For example an intra-subnet, intra-technology
   handover will take much less time than inter-subnet and inter-
   technology handover, because the mobile goes through a less number
   state transitions during the handover process.  Thus there are
   certain common properties such as characteristics of the access
   network, security association at each layers of the protocol stack
   during re-attachment, ways of layer 3 binding (e.g., obtaining IP
   address, binding update, media redirection), authorization,
   authentication in the new network play an important role to determine
   the overall handover delay.  Thus a heterogeneous handover will be
   subjected to higher handover delay compared to complete homogeneous
   handover (e.g.,a combination of intra-technology, intra-domain,
   intra-subnet).

   Thus it is desirable to devise a mechanism or framework that will
   help reduce these handover delays either by executing these state
   transitions in parallel or completing some of these proactively ahead
   of time.  A simple example may be to reduce the handover delay by
   discovering the new point of attachment, preconfiguring the new L3
   identifier, sending the binding update proactively or limiting it
   within a certain boundary limit and completing the authentication and
   authorization ahead of time prior to the movement into the new
   network.  There are several optimized mobility management solutions
   at different layers, [RFC4068], [RFC4140],[I-D.ohba-mobopts-mpa-
   framework], [SIPFAST], currently proposed that attempt to reduce

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the problem statement and issues associated
   with heterogeneous handover.  Any framework supporting optimized
   heterogeneous handover will need to make sure that the signaling and
   data are properly secured during the handover.  This security
   mechanism can be provided at any layer of the protocol stack.
