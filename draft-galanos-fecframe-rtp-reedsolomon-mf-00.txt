   Framework (described in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-sdp-elements]).  The Reed-
   Solomon codes used in this document belong to the class of Maximum
   Distance Separable (MDS) codes which means they offer optimal
   protection against random and bursty packet losses.

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for RS FEC            July 2009


1.  Introduction

   This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) that is generated by the Reed-Solomon code
   calculated over multiple RTP flows.

   By nature, Real-time applications are extremely sensitive to delay
   and require very low latency.  As a result, retransmission of lost
   packets or using other closed-loop schemes are not valid options and
   the use of Forward Error Correction (FEC) is an effective approach.

   A primary requirement from FEC for real time applications is the
   ability to perfectly recover from both random and bursty packet
   losses.  The Reed-Solomon FEC codes used in this document belong to
   the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes that are optimal
   in terms of erasure recovery capability for both situations.

   The format defined by this document enables the protection of
   multiple source flows with one or more repair flows without adding
   additional information to the source packets.  Such behavior reduces
   the delay presented by any FEC scheme and maintains backwards
   compatibility with non-FEC enabled receivers.

   Number of previous drafts were composed to draw different FEC schemes
   suitable for different applications.  The scheme defined in this
   draft is designed to compensate a burst of packet loss over RTP
   networks with minimum delay, which is needed in interactive IP-based
   applications such as video conferencing.

   The Read-Solomon codes used in this document have already been
   specified by Luigi Rizzo (see [Rizzo97]).  The document is compliant
   with the Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework (described in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework]) and SDP Elements for FEC Framework
   (described in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-sdp-elements]).

3.1.  Definitions

   FEC:  Forward Error Correction.

   Source Flow:  The packet flow to which FEC protection is to be
   applied.

   Repair Flow:  The packet flow carrying FEC data.

   Source Block:  The group of source data packets which are to be FEC
   protected as a single block.

   Source Packets:  Packets that are transmitted over a source flow

   Repair/FEC Packets:  Packets that are transmitted over a repair flow

   FEC header:  The header information contained in an FEC packet

3.2.  Notations

   K:  The number of packets in a source block

   N-K:  The number of repair FEC packets generated from a single source
   block

   L:  Source packet size


4.  Reed Solomon Codes

   The detailed operation and theory behind Reed Solomon codes is out of
   the scope of this document.  In general a Reed Solomon code takes a
   group of K data blocks and generates N - K FEC block.  A receiver
   needs to receive any K of the N data or FEC blocks in order to
   recover the remaining N-K data block.  The algorithm operates over
   multiple symbols each taken from a single data block.  The symbol
   size can be different in different implementations.  Any symbol size
   can be used in the format offered by this document.  However, it is
   recommended for simplicity to use symbol size of 8 bits (byte).  For
   more information of Reed Solomon codes, the reader is referred to
   [Rizzo97].


5.  Source Block Creation

   Using this framework the application can protect multiple RTP source
   flows using one or more FEC repair flows.  Therefore, the source
   block contains RTP packets taken from different flows (See Figure 1).

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for RS FEC            July 2009


   Moreover, a single source block MAY contain different number of
   packets from the different flows.

                 +------------+


                     Figure 1: Source Block generation

   A source block for the Reed-Solomon code contains K data blocks.  In
   the scheme presented by this document, each data block contains a
   single RTP packet and therefore a source block contains exactly K RTP
   packets.  The Reed-Solomon codes generates N-K repair blocks that are
   transmitted using N-K repair packets.  Each repair packet contains a
   single repair block.  Such behavior is most suitable for packet-
   switched networks where errors are on packet boundaries

   To create a source block the steps outlined below should be followed.

   1.  For each packet protected in this source block create a byte
       array as follows:

       A.  In the first two bytes place the unsigned network-ordered 16-
           bit representation of the RTP packet size (including RTP
           header +and payload)

       B.  Append the entire RTP packet including its RTP header

       C.  Add padding (bytes containing binary zeroes) so that the byte
           array is in the size of the largest packet protected by this
           source block including the two bytes from section a.  (The
           largest packet does not contain zero padding).

   2.  Append all the byte arrays one after the other in the following
       way:

       A.  Packets from the same flow are consecutive in the source
           block.

       B.  The packets of the same flow are in an increasing order of
           the sequence number as it appears in the RTP packet header
           taking wraparound into account

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for RS FEC            July 2009


       C.  The sequence number of packets belonging to the same flow
           must be consecutive in a single source block.

   Figure 2 demonstrates how a source block is created from packets
   taken from different flows.  In this example three flows marked with
   FID1, FID2 and FID3.  The source block is constructed from one packet
   (P1) taken from FID1, one packet (P2) taken from FID2 and two packets
   (P3, P4) taken from FID3.  The largest packet protected in this
   source block has the size of 5 (L=5) and therefore P1 and P3 are both
   padded with zeros to this size.  The source block contains the RTP
   packet size before each packet.  (Note that this example is not a
   binary representation of the source block.  The Packet size spans
   over two bytes as stated above)


            FID1 P1     FID2 P2       FID3 P3       FID3 P4
            L=3         L=5           L=4           L=5

            +---+       +-----+       +----+      +-----+
            |xxx|       |xxxxx|       |xxxx|      |xxxxx|
            +---+       +-----+       +----+      +-----+

                     |--- Source Block (K=4)-----|

                     +------+------+------+------+
                     |3xxx00|5xxxxx|4xxxx0|5xxxxx|
                     +------+------+------+------+

                   Figure 2: Structure of a Source Block

   The FEC Reed-Solomon Scheme gets a source block created from K
   packets and generates N-K FEC repair packets that protect the entire
   source block.  These packets are then transmitted in the repair flow.
   Padding is done only for FEC packet calculation and the original
   payloads are transmitted without extra padding.


6.  Packet Formats

   This section defines the formats of the source and repair packets

6.1.  Source Packets

   The FEC Framework requires that source packets contain information
   identifying the source block and the position within the source block
   occupied by the packet.  However, in order to maintain backwards
   compatibility, the scheme defined by this document enables the
   receiver to get this information without appending additional

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for RS FEC            July 2009


   information to the source packet.  Specifically this information is
   obtained using the combination of sequence number found in the RTP
   header and information provided in the FEC header of each repair
   packet.  Such behavior enables both non-FEC-capable and FEC-capable
   receivers to receive and interpret the same source packets.

6.2.  Repair Packets

   The FEC repair packets contain information that enables the receiver
   to reconstruct the source block in the remote end.  This is done by
   using the RTP header of the repair packets as well as another header
   that is placed within the RTP payload.  This header, referred to as
   the FEC header, is shown in Figure 3.


                +------------------------------+
                |          IP Header           |

                +------------------------------+

                +------------------------------+     > RTP Payload
                |        Repair Data           |   _/
                +------------------------------+ --


                    Figure 3: Format of repair packets

6.2.1.  RTP header format

   The RTP header is formatted according to [RFC3550] with some further
   clarifications listed below:

   o  Marker (M) Bit:  This bit is not used for this payload type, and
      is set to 0.

   o  Payload Type:  The (dynamic) payload type for the repair packets
      is determined through out-of-band means.  Note that this document
      registers new payload formats for the repair packets (Refer to
      Section 5 for details).  According to [RFC3550], an RTP receiver
      that cannot recognize a payload type must discard it.  This
      provides backward compatibility.  The FEC mechanisms can then be
      used in a multicast group with mixed FEC-capable and non-FEC-
      capable receivers.  If a non-FEC-capable receiver receives a
      repair packet, it will not recognize the payload type, and hence,
      will discard the repair packet.

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for RS FEC            July 2009


   o  Sequence Number (SN):  The sequence number has the standard
      definition.  It is one higher than the sequence number in the
      previously transmitted repair packet.  The initial value of the
      sequence number is random (unpredictable) [RFC3550].

   o  Timestamp (TS):  The timestamp is set to a time corresponding to
      the repair packet's transmission time.  Note that the timestamp
      value has no use in the actual FEC protection process and is
      usually useful for jitter calculations.

   o  Synchronization Source (SSRC):  The SSRC value is randomly
      assigned as suggested by [RFC3550].

6.2.2.  FEC header format

   The FEC header includes information that enables the receiver to
   reconstruct the source block and to identify the repair packets
   associated with each source block in their correct order.

   The format of the FEC header is shown in figure 4.

   0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |FEC Header Len |    N-K        |   i           | Num flows     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


                        Figure 4: FEC Header Format

   The FEC header consists of the general information fields and the
   per-flow fields.

   The FEC header consists of the following general fields:

   o  FEC Header Len - The length of this FEC header.  The FEC header
      does not have a fixed length and the length is varied according to
      the number of protected flows.

   o  N-K - The number of FEC packets used to protect this source block

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for RS FEC            July 2009


   o  i - 0 based packet index in the N-K FEC packets sequence.

   o  Num flows - The numbers of flows protected by this FEC packet.

   Following the general fields, the FEC header consists of the per-flow
   fields that include:

   o  FID - flow ID. the same value as specified in the "id" SDP
      parameter.  See example in section 9.

   o  Num Packets - The number of packets taken from this Flow.

   o  SN Base - the sequence number of the first source packet in the
      source block taken from this flow.

6.2.3.  Repair Data Format

   The repair data follows the FEC header in the RTP repair packet.  It
   includes the result of the Reed-Solomon code over the source block.
   Note that the first two bytes of the repair data contain the result
   of the Reed-Solomon code over the packet sizes in the source block
   and that the size of the repair data equals the size of the largest
   packet protected by this source block plus 2.  Therefore, the size of
   a FEC packet (FEC header and data) is larger than the longest source
   packet.


7.  Payload Format Parameters

   According to the FEC framework, when RTP is used as a transport for
   repair packet flows, the scheme must define an RTP Payload Format for
   the repair data.  This section provides the media subtype
   registration for the Reed-Solomon FEC of Multiple Flows.  The
   parameters that are required to configure the FEC encoding and
   decoding operations are also defined in this section.

7.1.  Media Type Registration

   This registration is done using the template defined in [RFC4288] and
   following the guidance provided in [RFC3555].

7.2.  Mapping of SDP Parameters

   For a proper operation details of the FEC scheme have to be
   communicated between the sender and the receiver.  Specifically, the
   receiver has to know the relationship between the source and the
   repair flows, how the sender applied protection to the source flows
   and how the repair flows can be used to recover the lost data.  One
   way to provide this information is to use the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].

   The mapping of the media type specification for "reed-solomon-mf-fec"
   and their parameters in SDP is as follows:

   o  The media type (e.g., "application") goes into the "m=" line as
      the media name.

   o  The media subtype goes into the "a=rtpmap" line as the encoding
      name.

   o  The remaining required payload-format-specific parameters go into
      the "a=fmtp" line by copying them directly from the media type
      string as a semicolon-separated list of parameter=value pairs.

   See section 9 for SDP examples.


8.  Protection and Recovery Procedures

   This section provides a complete specification of the protection and
   recovery procedures.

8.1.  Overview

   The FEC packets allow end systems to recover from the loss of media
   packets.  The following sections specify the steps involved in
   generating the repair packets and reconstructing the missing source
   packets from the repair packets.

8.2.  Repair Packet Construction

   The RTP header of a repair packet is formed based on the guidelines
   given in Section 6.2.1.  The FEC header is formed based on the
   guidelines given in Section 6.2.2.  The repair data is then appended
   to the FEC header.  The repair data is the result of the protection
   operation calculated on the source block.  This is the direct output
   of the Reed-Solomon code.  Note that the repair data will span over

   N-K packets.

8.3.  Source Packet Reconstruction

   Recovery requires two distinct operations.  The first determines
   which packets (media and FEC) must be combined in order to recover
   the missing packets.  Once this is done, the second step is the
   reconstruction of the missing data.

8.3.1.  Associating the Source and Repair Packets

   Association of the Source and Repair packets is done using a
   combination of the Source packet sequence number and the information
   found in the RTP header and the FEC header of the repair packets.
   The first step is to accumulate the N-K repair packets that were
   generated in the protection operation.  For that the application has
   to follow the steps listed below:

   o  For each received packet, retrieve the payload type parameter from
      the RTP header to identify the packet as a repair packet of the
      reed-solomon-mf scheme.

   o  Once a repair packet has been identified, retrieve the sequence
      number from the RTP header and the N-K and i parameters from the
      FEC header.

   o  With these three parameters, identify the collection of FEC
      packets generated for the source block.  For example, if N-K=4,
      i=2 and the sequence number is 1003, it means that 4 packets with
      sequence numbers 1001,1002,1003 and 1004 were generated for a
      specific source block.

   The application should then use the FEC header to identify the
   packets that constructed the source block.  For that the application
   has to follow the steps listed bellow:

   o  Retrieve the Num flows parameter from the FEC header.  This
      parameter specifies the number of rows in the per-flow information
      table.

   o  For each flow retrieve the FID, Num Packets and SN base
      parameters.

   The order of packets in the source block is identified by the order
   of the rows in the per-flow table.

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Format for RS FEC            July 2009


8.3.2.  Recovering the source packet

   In order to recover the lost packets the application has to rebuild
   the source block according to the guidelines given in section 5 and
   append the repair data to it in the correct order.  The order of the
   packets in the source block is specified by the order of the flow IDs
   in the FEC header.  In place of the lost packets the application
   should place blocks with zero padding.  The size of these blocks in
   bytes is the size of the repair data found in the repair packets.
   The repair data is the RTP payload without the FEC header information
   (see figure 3).  The application then appends the repair data taken
   from each repair packet.  This new block is provided to the Reed-
   Solomon code.

   The Reed-Solomon code will reconstruct the lost data into the
   provided source block overriding the zero padded blocks.  The
   application can then recover the lost packets as follows:

   o  The first two bytes include the RTP packet size.

   o  According to the packet size the application can retrieve the
      entire RTP packet (RTP header and payload).

   o  The extra padding bytes if exist are ignored.


9.  SDP Examples

   The following example demonstrates two source flows with flow IDs of
   0 and 1 that are protected by a single repair flow.
