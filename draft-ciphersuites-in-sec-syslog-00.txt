1.  Introduction

   The Syslog Working Group produced Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   Transport Mapping for Syslog [RFC5425] and Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) Transport Mapping for Syslog [RFC6012].

   Both [RFC5425] and [RFC6012] MUST support certificates as defined in
   [RFC5280].

   [RFC5425] requires that implementations "MUST" support TLS 1.2
   [RFC5246] and are "REQUIRED" to support the mandatory to implement
   cipher suite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (Section 4.2).

   [RFC6012] requires that implementations "MUST" support DTLS 1.0
   [RFC4347] and are also "REQUIRED" to support the mandatory to
   implement cipher suite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (Section 5.2).

   The TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite has been found to be
   weak and the community is moving away from it and towards more robust
   suites.

   The DTLS 1.0 transport [RFC4347] has been deprecated and the
   community is moving to DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347].

Internet-Draft       Cipher Suites in Secure Syslog        December 2021


   This document updates [RFC5425] and [RFC6012] to deprecate the use of
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA and to make new recommendations to a
   mandatory to implement cipher suite to be used for implementations.
   This document also updates [RFC6012] to deprecate the use of DTLS 1.0
   and to make a recommendation of a mandatory to implement secure
   datagram transport.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Support for Updating

   [I-D.salowey-tls-rfc8447bis] generally reminds us that cryptographic
   algorithms and parameters will be broken or weakened over time.
   Blindly implementing the cryptographic algorithms listed in any
   specification is not advised.  Implementers and users need to check
   that the cryptographic algorithms specified continue to provide the
   expected level of security.

   As the Syslog Working Group determined, Syslog clients and servers
   MUST use certificates as defined in [RFC5280].  Since both [RFC5425]
   and [RFC6012] REQUIRE the use of TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, it is
   very likely that RSA certificates have been implemented in devices
   adhering to those specifications.  [BCP195] notes that ECDHE cipher
   suites exist for both RSA and ECDSA certificates, so moving to an
   ECDHE cipher suite will not require replacing or moving away from any
   currently installed RSA-based certificates.

   [I-D.saviram-tls-deprecate-obsolete-kex] documents that the cipher
   suite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA has been found to be weak.  As
   such, the community is moving away from that and other weak suites
   and towards more robust suites such as
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, which is also listed as a
   currently Recommended algorithm in [I-D.salowey-tls-rfc8447bis].

   Along those lines, [I-D.ietf-uta-rfc7525bis] notes that
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA does not provide forward secrecy, a
   feature that is highly desirable in securing event messages.  That
   document also goes on to recommend
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 as a cipher suite that does
   provide forward secrecy.

Internet-Draft       Cipher Suites in Secure Syslog        December 2021


   Therefore, the mandatory to implement cipher suites listed in
   [RFC5425] and [RFC6012] must be updated so that implementations of
   secure syslog are still considered to provide an acceptable and
   expected level of security.

   Additionally, [BCP195] [RFC8996] deprecates the use of DTLS 1.0
   [RFC4347], which is the mandatory to implement transport protocol for
   [RFC6012].  Therefore, the transport protocol for [RFC6012] must be
   updated.

4.  Updates to RFC 5425

   Implementations of [RFC5425] MUST NOT offer
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA.  The mandatory to implement cipher
   suite is REQUIRED to be TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256.

   Implementations of [RFC5425] MUST continue to use TLS 1.2 [RFC5246]
   as the mandatory to implement transport protocol.

   Implementations of [RFC5425] MAY use TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] as a transport
   as long as they support the currently recommended cipher suites.

   EDITOR's NOTE: Need to address 0-RTT considerations.

5.  Updates to RFC 6012

   Implementations of [RFC6012] MUST NOT offer
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA.  The mandatory to implement cipher
   suite is REQUIRED to be TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256.

   Implementations of [RFC6012] MUST NOT use DTLS 1.0 [RFC4347].
   Implementations MUST use DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347].

   DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347] implementations are REQUIRED to support the
   mandatory to implement cipher suite, which is
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256.

   Implementations of [RFC6012] MAY use DTLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13]
   as a transport as long as they support the currently recommended
   cipher suites.

   EDITOR's NOTE: Need to address 0-RTT considerations.

Internet-Draft       Cipher Suites in Secure Syslog        December 2021


   Some members of the now closed Syslog Working Group were recently
   contacted by a member of the IEC 62351 TC 57 WG15 with the following
   message:

   |  For the development of an IEC cybersecurity standard for
   |  electrical power system, we (WG15) are trying to reference RFC
   |  5425 and adopt its specifications.  However, since RFC 5425
   |  specifies TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, which is currently
   |  insecure and depreciated cipher suite.  Therefore, we are trying
   |  to adopt stronger cipher suites in accordance with IEC 62351-3.
   |  IEC 62351-3 specifies a set of stronger state of the art cipher
   |  suites and thus defines a profile on how to apply TLS, addressing
   |  authentication, cipher suite requirements, renegotiation, etc.
   |  Therefore, we would like to use the state of the art cipher suites
   |  as specified in IEC 62351-3 and also mandatorily refer RFC 5425
   |  including the usage of its port number 6514 for transporting
   |  secure syslog traffic.  Our understanding would be that it does
   |  not violate RFC 5425, as it allows in section 4.2 of RFC 5425 that
   |  also stronger cipher suites may be used.

   This prompted the authors of this specification to draft it and
   propose it as an RFC.

   WG15 has also proposed the following text to be inserted into their
   documents.

   |  The selection of TLS connection parameters such as cipher suites,
   |  session resumption and renegotiation shall be reused from IEC
   |  62351-3 specification.  Note that port TCP/6514 is assigned by
   |  IANA to RFC 5425 (syslog-tls).  The RFC requires the support of
   |  TLS1.2 and a SHA-1 based cipher suite, but does not mandate its
   |  use.  The cipher does not align with IEC 62351-3 Ed.2 for
   |  profiling TLS.  Nevertheless, RFC 5425 does not rule out to use
   |  stronger cipher suites.  With this, clients and server supporting
   |  the selection of cipher suites stated in IEC 62351-3 Ed2 will not
   |  experience interoperability problems.  Caution has to be taken in
   |  environments in which interworking with existing services
   |  utilizing syslog over TLS is intended.  For these, the syslog
   |  server needs to be enabled to support the required cipher suites.
   |  This ensures connectivity with clients complying to this document
   |  and others complying to RFC 5425.  Note that meanwhile the work on
   |  an update of RFC 5425 and RFC 6012 has started.  It targets the
   |  adoption of stronger cipher suites for TLS and DTLS to protect
   |  syslog communication.

   Comments on this text are also welcome.

   The authors would like to thank Arijit Kumar Bose, Steffen Fries and
   the members of IEC TC57 WG15 for their review, comments, and
   suggestions.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests to IANA.

9.  Security Considerations

   This document deprecates an insecure DTLS transport protocol from
   [RFC6012] and deprecates insecure cipher suits from [RFC5425] and
   [RFC6012].  This document also specifies mandatory to implement
   cipher suites to those RFCs and the latest version of the DTLS
   protocol to [RFC6012].
