Problem Statement</h3>

<p>
				Low-power wireless personal area networks (LoWPANs) are formed by devices
				complying to the IEEE 802.15.4 standard <a class='info' href='#refs.IEEE802.15.4'>[5]<span> (</span><span class='info'>IEEE Computer Society, &ldquo;IEEE Std. 802.15.4-2003,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a><a class='info' href='#refs.IEEE802.15.4-2006'>[6]<span> (</span><span class='info'>IEEE Computer Society, &ldquo;IEEE Std. 802.15.4-2006,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. LoWPAN devices
				are distinguished by their low bandwidth, short range, scarce memory capacity, limited processing capability and other
				attributes of inexpensive hardware. In this document, the characteristics of nodes participating in LoWPANs
				are assumed to be those described in <a class='info' href='#RFC4919'>[3]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kushalnagar, N., Montenegro, G., and C. Schumacher, &ldquo;IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and Goals,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>.
			
</p>
<p>
				IEEE 802.15.4 networks support star and mesh topologies and consist of two different device types:
				reduced-function devices (RFDs) and full-function devices (FFDs). RFDs have the most limited capabilities
				and are intended to perform only simple and basic tasks. RFDs may only associate with a single FFD at a time, but
				FFDs may form arbitrary topologies and accomplish more advanced functions, such as multi-hop routing.
			
</p>
<p>
				However, neither the IEEE 802.15.4 standard nor the 6LoWPAN format specification
				("IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4" <a class='info' href='#RFC4944'>[4]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Montenegro, G., Kushalnagar, N., Hui, J., and D. Culler, &ldquo;Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>) specify how mesh topologies
				could be obtained and maintained. Thus, the 6LoWPAN formation and multi-hop routing 
				should be supported by higher layer, either 6LoWPAN adaptation layer or IP layer.
				In the IETF, a number of experimental protocols in IP layer have been developed in  
				many working groups. However, these existing routing protocols may not be satisfying 
				for mesh routing in a LoWPAN domain, for the following reasons:

				</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>
						6LoWPAN nodes have special types and roles, such as primary battery-operated RFDs, battery-operated and mains-powered FFDs,
						possibly various levels of RFDs and FFDs, mains-powered and high-performance gateways, data aggregators, etc. 6LoWPAN
						routing protocols should support multiple device types and roles.
					
</li>
<li>
						The more stringent requirements that apply to 6LoWPANs as opposed to higher performance or non-battery-operated networks.
						6LoWPAN nodes are characterized by small memory sizes, low processing power, and are running on very limited power
						supplied by primary non-rechargeable batteries.  A node's lifetime is usually defined by the lifetime of its battery.
					
</li>
<li>
						Handling sleeping nodes is very critical in 6LoWPANs, more than in traditional ad-hoc networks. 6LoWPAN nodes might stay
						in sleep-mode for most of the time. Time synchronization is important for efficient forwarding of packets.
					
</li>
<li>
						A possibly simpler routing problem; 6LoWPANs might be either transit-networks or stub-networks. We can focus
						on stub networks first as existing 6LoWPAN documents (implicitly or explicitly) show the 6LoWPAN picture 
						under the configuration of stub networks at this moment 
						<a class='info' href='#RFC4944'>[4]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Montenegro, G., Kushalnagar, N., Hui, J., and D. Culler, &ldquo;Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#refs.6lowpan.nd'>[8]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Chakrabarti, S. and E. Nordmark, &ldquo;LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery Extensions, draft-chakrabarti-6lowpan-ipv6-nd-04 (work in progress),&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. We can simplify
						networks by an assumption of no transit networks. (based on the necessity, we may extend the network configuration 
						including transit network case)
					
</li>
<li>
						A possibly harder routing problem; routing in 6LoWPANs requires to consider power-optimization, harsh environment,
						data-aware routing, etc. These are not easy requirements to satisfy together.
					
</li>
</ul><p>

				 This creates new challenges on obtaining robust and reliable mesh routing within LoWPANs.
			
</p>
<p>
				The 6LoWPAN problem statement document ("6LoWPAN Problems and Goals" <a class='info' href='#RFC4919'>[3]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kushalnagar, N., Montenegro, G., and C. Schumacher, &ldquo;IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs): Overview, Assumptions, Problem Statement, and Goals,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>)
				briefly mentions four requirements on routing protocols;
				</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>(a) low overhead on data packets
</p>
<p>(b) low routing overhead
</p>
<p>(c) minimal memory and computation requirements
</p>
<p>(d) support for sleeping nodes considering battery saving
</p>
</blockquote><p>
				These four high-level requirements only describe the need for low overhead and power saving.
				But, based on the fundamental features of LoWPAN, more detailed routing requirements are presented in this document,
				which can lead to further analysis and protocol design.
			
</p>
<p>
				Using the 6LoWPAN header format[6], there are two layers routing protocols can be defined at, commonly referred to
				as "mesh-under" and "route-over". The mesh-under approach supports routing under the IP link and is directly based
				on the link-layer IEEE 802.15.4 standard, therefore using (64-bit or 16-bit short) MAC addresses. On the other hand,
				the route-over approach relies on IP routing and therefore supports routing over possibly various types of
				interconnected links (see also <a class='info' href='#NetworkStack'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mesh-under (left) and route-over routing (right)</span><span>)</span></a>).
			
</p>
<p>
				Most statements in this document consider to both the mesh-under and route-over cases.
			
</p>
<p>
				In summary, the main issues of mesh routing in 6LoWPANs are:
				</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>
						The precise 6LoWPAN routing requirements must be defined.
					
</li>
<li>
						If a routing protocol for 6LoWPAN is designed to run in the IP layer, it
						should meet the 6LoWPAN-specific requirements. It needs to be clarified how existing routing solutions can be adapted to meet the low-power requirements
						presented in <a class='info' href='#Requirements'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>6LoWPAN Routing Requirements</span><span>)</span></a>.
						<br />

						  [Note] ROLL WG is now working on the protocol survey for Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), 
						  not specifically for 6LoWPAN. It will decide whether new solution will be developed or not, after that survey. 
						  This document is focused on 6LoWPAN specific requirements, in alignment with ROLL WG.
					
</li>
<li>
						If a routing procotol for 6LoWPAN within a subnet is designed to run in adaptation layer, 
						existing routing solutions do not operate in 6LoWPAN's adaptation layer 
						(and do not support the addressing scheme defined by IEEE 802.15.4). 

					
</li>
</ol><p>
			
</p>
<p>
				Considering the problems above, this draft addresses routing requirements for 6LoWPANs for
				both mesh-under and route-over routing protocol design.
			
</p>
<p>
				Application-specific features affect the design of 6lowpan routing requirements and the corresponding solutions.
				However, various applications can be profiled by similar technical characteristics. This document states the
				requirements to consider the features of 6LoWPAN applications in general. However, it does not mean
				that one single	routing solution may be the best one for all 6LoWPAN applications.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
Design Space</h3>

<p>
				Apart from a wide variety of routing algorithms possible for 6LoWPAN, the question remains as to whether routing should
				be performed mesh-under (in the adaptation layer defined by the 6lowpan format document <a class='info' href='#RFC4944'>[4]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Montenegro, G., Kushalnagar, N., Hui, J., and D. Culler, &ldquo;Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>), or
				in the IP-layer using a route-over approach. The most significant consequence of mesh-under routing is that routing would
				be directly based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, therefore using (64-bit or 16-bit short) MAC addresses instead of IP
				addresses, and a LoWPAN would be seen as a single IP link. In case a route-over mechanism is to be applied to a LoWPAN it
				must also support 6LoWPAN's unique properties using global IPv6 addressing.
			
</p>
<p>
				Additionally, because of the low-performance characteristics of LoWPANs, a light-weight routing protocol 
				must be provided that meets the design goals and requirements presented in this document.

				In order to avoid packet fragmentation and the overhead for reassembly, routing packets should fit into

				If a mesh-under routing protocol is built for operation in 6LoWPAN's adaptation layer, 
				routing control packets are placed after the 6LoWPAN Dispatch, unless a new code type is assigned for

Scenario Considerations and Parameters for 6LoWPAN Routing</h3>

<p>
				IP-based low-power WPAN technology is still in its early stage of development, but the range of conceivable usage
				scenarios is tremendous. The numerous possible applications of sensor networks make it obvious that mesh
				topologies will be prevalent in LoWPAN environments and routing will be a necessity for expedient communication.
				Research efforts in the area of sensor networking have put forth a large variety of multi-hop routing algorithms
				<a class='info' href='#refs.bulusu'>[7]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bulusu, N. and S. Jha, &ldquo;Wireless Sensor Networks,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. Most related work focuses on optimizing routing for specific application scenarios,
				which can largely be categorized into several models of communication, including the following ones:
				</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Flooding (in very small networks)
</li>
<li>Data-aware routing (dissemination vs. gathering)
</li>
<li>Event-driven vs. query-based routing
</li>
<li>Geographic routing
</li>
<li>Probabilistic routing
</li>
<li>Hierarchical routing
</li>
</ul><p>
				Depending on the topology of a 6LoWPAN and the application(s) running over it, different types of routing 
				may be used. However, this document abstracts from application-specific communication and describes 
				general routing requirements valid for any type of routing in 6LoWPANs.
			
</p>
<p>
				The following parameters can be used to describe specific scenarios in which the candidate routing protocols could
				be evaluated.

<blockquote class="text"><dl>

<dd>Network Properties:
</dd>
<ul class="text">
<li>
						Device Number, Density and Network Diameter: <br />

						These parameters usually affect the routing state directly
						(e.g. the number of entries in a routing table or neighbor
						list).  Especially in large and dense networks, policies must
						be applied for discarding "low-quality" and stale routing
						entries in order to prevent memory overflow.
					
</li>
<li>
						Connectivity: <br />

						Due to external factors or programmed disconnections, a 6LoWPAN
						can be in several states of connectivity; anything in the
						range from "always connected" to "rarely connected".  This
						poses great challenges to the dynamic discovery of routes
						across a LoWPAN.
					
</li>
<li>
						Dynamicity (include mobility): <br />

						Location changes can be induced by unpredictable external
						factors or by controlled motion, which may in turn cause route
						changes.  Also, nodes may dynamically be introduced into a
						LoWPAN and removed from it later.  The routing state and the
						volume of control messages is heavily dependent on the number
						of moving nodes in a LoWPAN and their speed.
					
</li>
<li>
						Deployment: <br />

						In a LoWPAN, it is possible for nodes to be scattered randomly
						or to be deployed in an organized manner.  The deployment can
						occur at once, or as an iterative process, which may also
						affect the routing state.
					
</li>
<li>
						Spatial Distribution of Nodes and Gateways: <br />

						Network connectivity depends on node spatial distribution besides
						other factors like device number, density and transmission range. For
						instance, nodes can be placed on a grid, or can be randomly placed in
						an area (bidimensional Poisson distribution), etc.
						In addition, if the LoWPAN is connected to other networks through
						infrastructure nodes called gateways, the number and spatial
						distribution of gateways affects network congestion and available
						bandwidth, among others.
					
</li>
<li>
						Traffic Patterns, Topology and Applications: <br />

						The design of a LoWPAN and the requirements on its application
						have a big impact on the network topology and the most efficient routing type to be
						used.  For different traffic patterns (point-to-point,
						multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint) and network
						architectures, various routing mechanisms have been
						introduced, such as data-aware, event-driven, address-centric,
						and geographic routing.
					
</li>
<li>
						Quality of Service (QoS): <br />

						For mission-critical applications, support of QoS is mandatory
						in resource-constrained LoWPANs and cannot be achieved without
						a certain degree of routing protocol overhead.
					
</li>
<li>
						Security: <br />

						LoWPANs may carry sensitive information and require a high
						level of security support where the availability, integrity,
						and confidentiality of data are primordial.  Secured messages
						cause overhead and affect the power consumption of LoWPAN
						routing protocols.
					
</li>
</ul>
<dt>b.</dt>
<dd>Node Parameters:
</dd>
<ul class="text">
<li>
						Processing Speed and Memory Size: <br />

						These basic parameters define the maximum size of the routing
						state. LoWPAN nodes may have different performance
						characteristics beyond the common RFD/FFD distinction.
					
</li>
<li>
						Power Consumption and Power Source: <br />

						The number and topology of battery- and mains-powered nodes in
						a LoWPAN affect routing protocols in their selection of
						optimal paths for network lifetime maximization.
					
</li>
<li>
						Transmission Range: <br />

						This parameter affects routing.  For example, a
						high transmission range may cause a dense network, which in
						turn results in more direct neighbors of a node, higher
						connectivity  and a larger routing state.
					
</li>
<li>
						Traffic Pattern:
						This parameter affects routing since high-loaded nodes (either
						because they are the source of packets to be transmitted or due
						to forwarding) may incur a greater contribution to delivery
						delays than low-loaded nodes. This applies to both data
						packets and routing control messages themselves.

6LoWPAN Routing Requirements</h3>

<p>
				This section defines a list of requirements for 6LoWPAN routing.  The
				most important design property unique to low-power networks is that 6LoWPANs
				support multiple device types and roles, for example:
				</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>primary battery-operated RFDs
</li>
<li>battery-operated and mains-powered FFDs
</li>
<li>possibly various levels of RFDs and FFDs
</li>
<li>mains-powered, high-performance gateway(s)
</li>
<li>data aggregators, etc.
</li>
</ul><p>
				
<p>
					Due to these unique device types and roles 6LoWPANs need to consider
					the following two primary features:
				
</p>
				
<ul class="text">
<li>
						Power conservation: some devices are mains-powered, but most are
						battery-operated and need to last several months to a few years
						with a single AA battery. Many devices are mains-powered most of
						the time, but still need to function for possible extended periods
						from batteries (e.g. on a construction site before building power
						is switched on for the first time).
					
</li>
<li>
						Low performance: tiny devices, small memory sizes, low-performance processors,
						low bandwidth, high loss rates, etc.
					
</li>
</ul><p>
				These fundamental features of LoWPANs affect the design of routing
				solutions, so that existing routing specifications should be
				simplified and modified to the smallest extent possible, in order to
				fit the low-power requirements of LoWPANs, meeting the following
				requirements:

Routing Requirements depending on the 6LoWPAN Device Properties</h3>

						The lifetime of a wireless sensor node depends on the energy it

				    [R08] 6LoWPAN routing protocols SHOULD be robust to dynamic loss
					caused by link failure or device unavailability either in short-term
					(e.g. due to RSSI variation, interference variation, noise and asynchrony)
					or in long-term (e.g. due to a depleted power source, hardware breakdown,
					operating system misbehavior, etc).

<blockquote class="text">
<p>
						An important trait of 6LoWPAN devices is their unreliability due to
						limited system capabilities, and also because they might be closely
						coupled to the physical world with all its unpredictable variation.
						In harsh environments, LoWPANs easily suffer from
						link failure. Collision or link failure easily increases Send
						Queue/Receive Queue (SQ/RQ) and it can lead to queue overflow and
						packet losses.
					
</p>
<p>
				    	The routing protocol has to exploit network resources (e.g. path redundancy) 
					    to offer good network behavior despite node failure.
						For instance, in case of structural health monitoring, hundreds of
						nodes could be placed on 20 bridge pillars spanning over a river.
						Once the nodes are distributed, they are hardly accessible for
						maintenance and in case of single node failure, the network should
						not break down.
					
</p>

						The design of routing protocols for 6LoWPANs must consider the fact that packets are to be delivered
						with reasonable probability despite unreliable and unresponsive nodes.

MAC-coupled Requirements</h3>

<p>
					The routing requirements described in this subsection allow optimization
					and correct operation of routing solutions taking into account the
					specific features of IEEE 802.15.4 physical and MAC layers.
				
</p>
<p>
				    [R11] 6LoWPAN protocols SHOULD support secure delivery of control messages.
				    A minimal security level can be achieved by utilizing AES-based mechanism 
					provided by IEEE 802.15.4.
				
</p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
						Security threats within LoWPANs may be different from existing
						threat models in ad-hoc network environments.  Neighbor Discovery
						in IEEE 802.15.4 links may be susceptible to threats as listed in
						RFC3756 <a class='info' href='#RFC3756'>[2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Nikander, P., Kempf, J., and E. Nordmark, &ldquo;IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Trust Models and Threats,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>.  Bootstrapping may also impose additional threats.
						Security is also very important for designing robust routing
						protocols, but it should not cause significant transmission
						overhead. While there are applications which require very high security,
						such as in traffic control, other applications are less easily harmed by
						wrong node behavior, such as a home entertainment system.
					
</p>
<p>
						The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC provides an AES-based security mechanism. Routing
						protocols need to define how this mechanism can be used to obtain
						the intended security. Byte overhead of the mechanism, which depends
						on the security services selected, must be considered. In the worst
						case in terms of overhead, the mechanism consumes 21 bytes of MAC
						payload.

   					fragmentation of physical layer (PHY) frames.

<blockquote class="text">

						In order to save energy, routing overhead should be minimized

						required for transmission, avoids unnecessary waste of bandwidth,
						and prevents the need for packet reassembly. As calculated in
