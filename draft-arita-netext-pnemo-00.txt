Internet Draft      Proxy Network Mobility Protocol     October 12, 2010


Abstract          

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) provides the Internet connectivity to
   Mobile Node in a PMIPv6 domain. Current PMIPv6 specification supports
   only Host Mobility. In order to support a network mobility, this
   document defines Proxy Mobility Protocol that provides and maintains
   the connectivity for the Mobile Network Node (MNN) in the mobile
   network (nemo). This document discusses the deployment consideration
   of PNEMO and proposes the possible solution accordingly.

1. Introduction

   Network Mobility Basic Support (NEMO BS) [RFC-3963] was proposed to
   support network mobility. Similar to Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [RFC-3775],
   the Home Agent (HA) and the Mobile Router (MR) are important entities
   in NEMO BS. The HA maintains the prefix of the mobile network (nemo)
   and forwards packets to and from the nemo. The MR establishes a bi-
   directional tunnel to the HA. However, NEMO BS has several problems.
   If the nemo is nested, the header overhead increases because of
   multiple tunnels. If the wireless link between the MR and the access
   router (AR) is unstable after handover, the signaling messages such
   as Binding Update (BU) might be lost.


   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC-5213] provides mobility to the Mobile
   Node (MN) in the PMIPv6 domain. To achieve mobility in the PMIPv6
   domain, the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) and the Mobile Access Gateway
   (MAG) are installed. The LMA serves as the HA in MIPv6. It manages
   the binding between the LMA and the MAG to which the MN is attached.
   The MAG sends the signaling messages to MN's LMA on behalf of the MN.
   It establishes a bi-directional tunnel to the LMA. In PMIPv6, the
   signaling messages are exchanged in the wired network. Even if the
   wireless link between the MN and the MAG is unstable after handover,
   the signaling messages between the MAG and the LMA are rarely lost.


   This document defines a protocol called PNEMO that provides network-
   based localized mobility to a mobile network. In PNEMO, the signaling
   messages are exchanged between the MAG and the LMA, i.e., the MR does
   not participate in the signaling procedure. PNEMO is an extension of
   PMIPv6. The MR sends and receives the packets for the Visited Mobile
   Node (VMN) and the Local Fixed Node (LFN). It also informs the state
   of the nemo to the LMA and the MAG. As the LMA and the MAG manage the
   location information of the VMN and the nested network, they can
   forward the packets to the VMN and the nested network in the nemo.

   The MR has the NEMO State Table, which manages the location
   information of the VMN and the nested network in its lower subnet.

3.  Proxy Network Mobility Protocol

3.1. Protocol Overview

   This document defines the specification of a network-based mobility
   management protocol for a mobile network (nemo), called Proxy Network
   Mobility Protocol (PNEMO). It is an extension of Proxy Mobile IPv6.

   The LMA and the MAG will keep track of nemo's movements, initiate the
   mobility signaling, and set up the required routing state.

   The entities in the NETLMM infrastructure are the LMA, the MAG and
   the MR. The LMA is responsible for maintaining the reachability state
   of the MR and the VMN. it allocates the prefixes for mobile nodes to
   configure their address. The MR is allocated the Home Network Prefix
   (HNP) and the Mobile Network Prefix (MNP). The VMN is allocated the
   HNP. The LMA is the topological anchor point for these prefixes. The
   MAG is the entity that performs the mobility management on behalf of
   the MR and the VMN. It emulates the Home Link of the MR and the VMN.
   It is responsible for detecting nemo's movements to and from the
   access link and for initiating binding registrations to the LMA of
   the MR's or the VMN's. The MAG itself manages its binding information
   of the nemo. When the MAG receives packets destined to the nodes in
   the nemo, it forwards the packets to the corresponding MR. A nemo
   consists of a MR, VMNs and LFNs. The MR is the default router of the
   nemo and the entity that manages the nested network. In the nested
   nemo, the MR informs the configuration change in the nemo to the MAG.
   The LFN in the nemo configures its address using  the MNP advertised
   by the MR.

                     Figure 1. Architecture of PNEMO

   The architecture of PNEMO is shown in Figure 1. In this figure, a VMN
   and a nemo composed of a MR and a LFN are attached to a MAG.

   Figure 2 shows the signaling flow when a nemo enters a PMIPv6 domain.
   When the MR is attached to a PMIPv6 domain, the MAG detects MR's
   attachment and acquires MR's identifier. It determines whether the MR
   is authorized for the network-based mobility management service.
   After the MR is authorized for the network-based mobility service,
   the MAG sends the Proxy Binding Update (PBU) message to MR's LMA to
   register the current location of the MR.

   When the LMA accepts the PBU message, it creates the Binding Cache
   Entry for the MR and sets up its endpoint of the bi-directional
   tunnel to the MAG. Then the LMA sends the Proxy Binding
   Acknowledgement (PBA) message including the HNP and the MNP to the
   MAG that the MR attaches to.

   When the MAG receives the PBA message, it sets up its endpoint of the
   bi-directional tunnel to the LMA and also sets up the forwarding
   state for nemo's traffic. To emulate the Home Link of the MR, the MAG
   configures certain link local addresses. Then, it sends the Router
   Advertisement (RA) message to the MR.

   The MR configures its address using the HNP advertised by the MAG and
   it advertise the RA message including the MNP to the nemo.

   If there is a LFN in the nemo, the LFN configures its address using

   the MNP. The LMA and the MAG have proper routing states for handling
   the traffic sent to and from the nemo using the address from its MNP.

         Figure 2. Mobile Router Attachment - Signaling Call Flow


   Figure 3 shows the signaling flow for nemo's handoff. The MR moves
   from the previously attached MAG (p-MAG) to the newly attached MAG
   (n-MAG). When the MR changes its point of attachment to the Internet,
   the p-MAG can detect MR's detachment from the access link. The p-MAG
   sends a De-registration request message to MR's LMA and deletes the
   binding and routing state for the MR. On receiving the request
   message, the LMA accepts the request and deletes the binding for the
   MR if the LMA does not receive the PBU from the n-MAG within the
   timeout.

   When the MR is attached to the new link, the n-MAG detects MR's
   attachment. Then, the n-MAG sends the PBU message to MR's LMA to

   update the binding state. After the signaling procedure, the n-MAG
   sends the RA message to advertise the HNP and the MNP to the MR. The
   MR does not detect the changes with respect to the layer-3 attachment
   of this interface.

   On receiving the RA message from the n-MAG, the MR sends the RA
   message with the MNP to the nemo. The LFN receives the RA message and
   configures its address if it does not have its address.

   In Figure 3, the RS message and the RA message are exchanged between
   the MR and the n-MAG. Because the MR has already set its address and
   the default router, the MR does not need the RA message.

   Figure 4 shows an example of a nested nemo. Figure 5 shows the
   signaling flow when a nemo is nested. When another MR (MR2) or a VMN
   is attached to the MR (MR1) which is connected to the MAG, MR1
   detects MR2's or VMN's attachment. Then MR1 sends the Nested Binding
   Update (NBU) message including MR2's or VMN's identifier to the MAG.

   After the MAG receives the NBU message, it determines whether MR2 or

   Then the MAG sends the PBU message to the LMA to update its binding
   state. When the LMA receives the PBU message, the LMA registers MR1's
   identifier into MR2's or VMN's upper-router field in the BCE and
   updates the tunnel identifier field in the BCE. After the LMA sets up
   the BCE, the LMA sends the PBA message to the MAG. On receiving the
   PBA message, the MAG registers MR'1 identifier as the upper-router
   identifier in the Binding Update List Entry (BULE) that the MAG
   manages to maintain the binding state of a nemo. After that the MAG
   sets up the routing table to the nested nemo. MR1 receives the Nested
   Binding Acknowledgement (NBA) message that the MAG sends to MR1 and
   updates the NEMO State Table. MR1 has the mobility information of the
   mobile nodes attached to MR1 in the NEMO State Table.

   When MR3 or a VMN attaches to MR2, a recursive procedure is needed to
   update upper router's NEMO State Table, the BULE, and the BCE. MR2
   sends the NBU message to its upper router (MR1). MR1 receives the NBU
   message and creates the NEMO State Table related to MR3 or the VMN.
   Then MR1 sends the Proxy Nested Binding Update (PNBU) message to the
   MAG. After the LMA and the MAG finish their process, MR1 receives the
   Proxy Nested Binding Acknowledgement (PNBA) message. Then MR1 updates
   its NEMO State Table and sets up the routing table. MR1 sends the NBA
   message to MR2. MR2 updates its NEMO State Table after receiving the
   NBA message.

   Figure 6 shows the handoff procedure when a nemo is nested. Even if a
   nemo is nested, the handoff procedure is the same as the non-nested
   case. The LMA and the MAG also update the entries for the nodes in
   the nested nemo. When the LMA and the MAG receive the signaling
   message such as the PBU, they check all entries in its binding table.

   If an identifier in the upper router field equals to the Mobile Node
   Identifier option in the signaling message, the LMA and the MAG find
   that this entry must be updated.

4.  Local Mobility Anchor Operation

   In order to manage the binding states of the MR and the VMN, some new
   functions MUST be added to the LMA.

   The LMA MUST have the function that allocates and manages the MNP. In
   order to forward the packets to LFN's address configured using the
   MNP, the LMA MUST intercept the packets destined to the MNP.

   To update the BCEs for the MR and the VMN in the nested nemo, the
   format of the PBU and the PBA messages MUST be extended. The PBU and
   the PBA message MUST have the Mobile Network Prefix option. This
   option informs the LMA and the MAG of the prefixes that are allocated
   to the nemo. The PBU and the PBA messages MUST also have the Upper
   Mobile Router option. This option informs the LAM and the MAG of the
   identifier of the upper MR to which the VMN and the MR are attached.
   The upper MR MUST be the MR that is attached to the MAG directly.


   The format of the BCE in the LMA MUST be extended to manage the MNP
   and the upper MR's identifier. The BCE has the R flag field in order
   to indicate whether or not this BCE is created for a MR or a single
   node. For a MR, this flag is set to value 1 and is set to value 0 for

   a single node. The BCE in the LMA also has the Mobile Network Prefix
   field to manage the MNP. Besides, the BCE in the LMA has the Upper
   Mobile Router field. In the nested nemo scenario, if the LMA receives
   the signaling messages such as the PBU including the MR's identifier,
   the LMA updates the BCE for MR's identifier and the BCE whose upper
   router field equals to the MR's identifier. The LMA can manage the
   mobility of the nested nemo.



5.  Mobile Access Gateway Operation

   In order to manage the binding states of the MR and the VMN, some new
   functions MUST be added to the MAG.

   The format of the BULE MUST be extended to manage the mobility of the
   nemo and the nested nemo. The Mobile Network Prefix field, the Upper
   Mobile Router field and the R flag must be added to the BULE in the
   MAG. If the R flag in the BULE is set to value 1, the entry is for a
   MR. If this R flag in the BULE is set to value 0, the entry is for a
   single node. The identifier of the Upper Mobile Router Identifier
   option in the signaling message from the MR is stored into the upper
   mobile router field.

   In order to manage the mobility of the nested nemo, PNEMO defines the
   following new signaling messages, the Nested Binding Update (NBU),
   the Netsted Binding Acknowledgement (NBA), the Proxy Nested Binding
   Update (PNBU) and the Proxy Nested Binding Acknowledgement (PNBA).

   Figure 7. shows the formats of the new signaling messages. The NBU
   and the NBA have the P flag and some Mobility options. If the P flag
   is set to value 1, this signaling message is called the PNBU or the
   PNBA. The NBU and the PNBU have the Mobile Node Identifier option,
   the Home Network Prefix option, the Mobile Network Prefix option and
   the Upper Mobile Router Identifier option as the Mobility Options.
   The NBA and the PNBA have the Mobile Node Identifier option, the Home
   Network Prefix option, the Mobile Network Prefix option as the
   Mobility Options and the P flag.

                  Figure 8. An Example of a Nested NEMO

   Figure 8 shows an example of a nested nemo. When the MAG receives the
   NBU message from MR1 after MR2 is attached to MR1, the MAG creates an
   entry for MR2 in the BULE. The MAG registers the identifier of MR2 in
   the Mobile Node Identifier option with the Mobile Node Identifier
   field in this entry and registers the identifier and the link local
   address of MR1 with the Upper Mobile Router field and the Linklocal
   Address field in this entry, respectively. After authentication, the
   MAG sends the PBU message to its LMA.

   If the MR3 is attached to MR2, the MAG receives the PNBU message from
   MR1. As the MAG receives the NBU message, it sets up the binding
   states. Then the MAG sends the PBU message to its LMA. The LMA sends
   the PBA message containing the HNP and the MNP to allocate them to
   the nested nemo. After the MAG receives the PBA message, it updates
   entries for MR2 and MR3. Then the MAG sends the NBA or the PNBA
   message to MR1.



6. Mobile Router Operation

   Each MR MUST have the NEMO State Table (NST) to manage the location
   of the nested nemo. The NST has the Mobile Node Identifier field, the

   Home Network Prefix field, the Mobile Network Prefix field, the
   Mobile Node Linklocal Address field and the Upper Mobile Router
   field.

   The Mobile Node Identifier field has the identifier of the nested MR
   (e.g., MR2) attached to the MR (e.g., MR1). The Home Network Prefix
   field and the Mobile Network Prefix field have the prefixes that are
   allocated to the nested nemo. The link local address in the Mobile
   Node Linklocal Address field is the next hop node's link local
   address to the HNP and MNP. MR's identifier in the Upper Mobile
   Router field is the next hop node's identifier to the destination.

   The signaling flow of the nested nemo is shown below. In Figure 8,
   MR1 is connected to the MAG and MR2 is connected to MR1. When MR3 is
   attached to MR2, MR3 sends the Router Solicitation (RS) message to
   MR2.

   MR2 detects MR3's attachment and creates the NST for MR3. MR2 sends
   the NBU message whose Mobile Node identifier option is set to the
   identifier of MR3 and whose Upper Mobile Router option is set the
   identifier of MR2 to MR1.

   After MR1 receives the NBU message, MR1 creates an entry for MR3 in
   the NST. Its Mobile Node Identifier field is set to the identifier of
   MR3 and its Upper Mobile Router field is set to the identifier of
   MR2. Then MR1 sends the PNBU message containing MR1's identifier in
   its Upper Mobile Router option to the MAG.

   After the MAG updates its BULE and the LMA updates its BCE, the MAG
   sends the PNBA message to MR1. When MR1 receives the PNBA message, it
   sets a lifetime in its NST. Then MR1 sends the NBA message to MR2.

   MR2 updates its NST and extracts the HNP and the MNP from the NBA
   message. Then the MR2 sends the Router Advertisement (RA) message to
   advertise the HNP and the MNP to MR3.

   MR3 configures its address using the HNP and sends the RA message
   with the MNP to its network.
