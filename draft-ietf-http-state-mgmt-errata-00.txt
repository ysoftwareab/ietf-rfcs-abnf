                          Status of this Memo

     This document is an Internet-Draft.  Internet-Drafts are
     working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force
     (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that other
     groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
     Drafts.

     Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
     months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other
     documents at any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-
     Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as
     ``work in progress.''

     To learn the current status of any Internet-Draft, please

     This is author's draft 1.9.


1.  ABSTRACT

This document contains miscellaneous small wording changes and
clarifications to draft-ietf-http-state-mgmt-05, the HTTP State
Management Mechanism draft.


2.  PROPOSED CHANGES

Changes are referenced to the sections in the original document.  New or
changed text is shown in []'s.

4.2.2 Set-Cookie Syntax
     Under the heading: Comment=comment:

     ``Optional.  Because cookies can contain private information about
     a user, the [Comment] attribute allows an origin server to document
     its intended use of a cookie....''

     Under the heading: Secure:

     ``Optional.  The Secure attribute (with no value) directs the user
     agent to use only (unspecified) secure means to contact the origin
     server whenever it sends back this cookie[, to protect the
     confidentially and authenticity of the information in the
     cookie].''

4.2.3  Controlling Caching

     The directive max-age=0 is necessary in the Cache-Control header to
     force revalidation.  Therefore, two example headers must change.

     The example header in the second bullet should read Cache-Control:
     must-revalidate[, max-age=0].

     The example header in the third bullet should read Cache-Control:
     proxy-revalidate[, max-age=0].

4.3.2  Rejecting Cookies
     ``To prevent possible security or privacy violations, a user agent
     rejects a cookie (shall not store its information) if any of the
     following is true [of the attributes explicitly present in the
     Set-Cookie response header]:...''

10.2 Compatibility with Microsoft's Implementation
     [Insert new section between current sections 10.1 and 10.2.]

     ``Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) Version 3 and earlier will
     fail to handle some cookies that use this specification.  For
     example, if a server sends the following response header to MSIE V3
     (omitting the line breaks):

     Set-cookie: xx="1=2&3-4";
         Comment="blah";
         Version=1; Max-Age=15552000; Path=/;
         Expires=Sun, 27 Apr 1997 01:16:23 GMT

     then MSIE V3 will send something like the following request header
     next time:

         Cookie: Max-Age=15552000

     instead of the correct

         Cookie: xx="1=2&3-4"

     In other words, MSIE sends back the wrong cookie name and value.''
