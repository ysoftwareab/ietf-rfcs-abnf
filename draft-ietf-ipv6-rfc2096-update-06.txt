 Abstract 
     
    This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base 
    (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet 
    community.  In particular, it describes managed objects related to 
    the forwarding of Internet Protocol (IP) packets in an IP version-
    independent manner.  This document obsoletes RFC 2096.

    IP Forwarding Table MIB                                January 2004 
     
 1  Introduction 
     
    This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base 
    (MIB) for use in managing objects related to the forwarding of 
    Internet Protocol (IP) packets in an IP version-independent manner. 
     
    It should be noted that the MIB definition described herein does 
    not support multiple instances based on the same address family 
    type.  However, it does support an instance of the MIB per address 
    family.

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
    this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 
    [RFC2119]. 
     
 3  The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
     
    For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
    Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 
    of RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
     
    Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
    termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are 
    generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol 
    (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms 
    defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This 
    memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which 
    is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 
    [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580]. 
     
 4  Overview 
     
    The MIB consists of one current table and two current global 
    objects. 
     
         1. The object inetCidrRouteNumber indicates the number of 
            current routes.  This is primarily to avoid having to read 
            the table in order to determine this number. 
  
         2. The object inetCidrRouteDiscards counts the number of valid 
            routes that were discarded from inetCidrRouteTable for any 
            reason.  This object replaces the ipRoutingDiscards and 
            ipv6DiscardedRoutes objects. 
     
         3. The inetCidrRouteTable provides the ability to display IP 
            version-independent multipath CIDR routes. 
     
 4.1 Relationship to other MIBs

    IP Forwarding Table MIB                                January 2004 
     
    This MIB definition contains several deprecated and obsolete tables 
    and objects.  The following subsections describe the relationship 
    between these objects and other MIB modules. 
     
 4.1.1   RFC 1213 
     
    The ipRouteTable object was originally defined in RFC 1213.  It was 
    updated by ipForwardTable in RFC 1354. 
     
 4.1.2   RFC 1354 
     
    The ipForwardTable object replaced the ipRouteTable object from RFC 
    1213.  It was in turn obsoleted by the ipCidrRouteTable defined in 
    RFC 2096. 
     
    In addition, RFC 1354 introduced ipForwardNumber.  This object 
    reflects the number of entries found in ipForwardTable.  It was 
    obsoleted by ipCidrRouteNumber, defined in RFC 2096. 
     
 4.1.3   RFC 2096 
     
    In RFC 2096, the ipCidrRouteTable and ipCidrRouteNumber were 
    introduced.  The ipCidrRouteTable object supports multipath IP 
    routes having the same network number but differing network masks.  
    The number of entries in that table is reflected in 
    ipCidrRouteNumber.  These objects are deprecated by the definitions 
    contained in this MIB definition. 
     
 4.1.4   RFC 2011 and 2465 
     
    RFC 2011 contains the ipRoutingDiscards object which counts the 
    number of valid routes which have been removed from the 
    ipCidrRouteTable object.  The corresponding ipv6DiscardedRoutes 
    object is defined in RFC 2465.  These objects are deprecated in 
    favor of the version-independent object inetCidrRouteDiscards 
    defined in this MIB.

 6  Security Considerations 
  
    There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
    with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
    objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
    environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
    environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
    network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their 
    sensitivity/vulnerability: 
     
       1. The inetCidrRouteTable contains routing and forwarding 
         information that is critical to the operation of the network 
         node (especially routers).  Allowing unauthenticated write 
         access to this table can compromise the validity of the 
         forwarding information. 
  
    Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with 
    a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive 
    or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important 
    to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and 
    possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
    them over the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects 
    and their sensitivity/vulnerability: 
     
       1. The inetCidrRouteTable contains routing and forwarding 
         information that can be used to compromise a network.  
         Specifically, this table can be used to construct a map of the 
         network in preparation for a denial-of-service attack on the 
         network infrastructure. 
       2. The inetCidrRouteProto object identifies the routing protocols 
         in use within a network.  This information can be used to 
         determine how a denial-of-service attack should be launched. 
     
    SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  
    Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
    even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
    allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
    objects in this MIB module. 
     
    It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
    as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
    including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
    authentication and privacy). 
     
    Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
    RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
    enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
    responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
    instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access 
    to the objects only to those principals (users) that have 
    legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

    The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any

    claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances 
    of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made 
    to obtain a general license or permission for the use of such 
    proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification 
    can be obtained from the IETF Secretariat. 
     
    The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any 
    copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary 
    rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice 
    this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF

 8  Changes from RFC 2096 
     
    This document updates RFC 2096 in the following ways: 
     
       1. Replaces ipCidrRouteTable with inetCidrRouteTable.  This 
         applies to corresponding objects and conformance statements. 
       2. Utilized the InetAddress TC to support IP version-independent 
         implementations of the forwarding MIB.  This gives common 
         forwarding MIB support for IPv4 and IPv6. 
       3. Created a read-only conformance statement to support 
         implementations that only wish to retrieve data. 
       4. Created the inetCidrRouteDiscards object to replace the 
         deprecated ipRoutingDiscards and ipv6DiscardedRoutes objects. 
     
    The inetCidrRouteTable retains the logical structure of the 
    ipCidrRouteTable in order to allow the easy upgrade of existing 
    IPv4 implementations to the version-independent MIB.
