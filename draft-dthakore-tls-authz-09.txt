  Transport Layer Security (TLS) Authorization Using DTCP Certificate
                      draft-dthakore-tls-authz-09

Abstract

   This document specifies the use of Digital Transmission Content
   Protection (DTCP) certificates as an authorization data type in the
   authorization extension for the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   Protocol.  This is in accordance with the guidelines for
   authorization extensions as specified in [RFC5878].  As with other
   TLS extensions, this authorization data can be included in the client
   and server Hello messages to confirm that both parties support the
   desired authorization data types.  If supported by both the client
   and the server, DTCP certificates are exchanged in the supplemental
   data TLS handshake message as specified in RFC4680.  This
   authorization data type extension is in support of devices containing
   DTCP certificates, issued by the Digital Transmission Licensing
   Administrator [DTLA].

1.  Introduction

   The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol (TLS1.0 [RFC2246], TLS1.1
   [RFC4346], TLS1.2 [RFC5246]) is being used in an ever increasing
   variety of operational environments, the most common among which is
   its use in securing HTTP traffic ([RFC2818]).  [RFC5878] introduces
   extensions that enable TLS to operate in environments where
   authorization information needs to be exchanged between the client
   and the server before any protected data is exchanged.  The use of
   these TLS authorization extensions is especially attractive since it
   allows the client and server to determine the type of protected data
   to exchange based on the authorization information received in the
   extensions.

Internet-Draft             TLS Auth Using DTCP             February 2015


   A substantial number of deployed consumer electronics devices such as
   televisions, tablets, game consoles, set-top boxes and other
   multimedia devices contain [DTLA] issued Digital Transmission Content
   Protection [DTCP] certificates.  These DTCP certificates enable
   secure transmission of premium audio-visual content between devices
   over various types of links (e.g., DTCP over IP [DTCP-IP]).  These
   DTCP certificates can also be used to verify device functionality
   (e.g., supported device features)

   This document describes the format and necessary identifiers to
   exchange DTCP certificates within the supplemental data message (see
   [RFC4680]) while negotiating a TLS session.  The DTCP certificates
   are then used independent of their use for content protection (e.g.,
   to verify supported features) and the corresponding DTCP
   Authentication and Key Exchange (AKE) protocol.  This communication
   allows either the client or the server or both to perform certain
   actions or provide specific services.  The actual semantics of the
   authorization decision by the client/server are beyond the scope of
   this document.  The DTCP certificate, which is not an X.509
   certificate, can be cryptographically tied to the X.509 certificate
   being used during the TLS tunnel establishment by an EC-DSA [DTCP]
   signature.

1.1.  Applicability Statement

   DTCP-enabled consumer electronics devices (eg. televisions, game
   consoles) use DTCP certificates for secure transmission of audio-
   visual content.  The Authentication and Key Exchange (AKE) protocol
   defined in [DTCP] is used to exchange DTCP Certificates and allows a
   device to be identified and authenticated based on the information in
   the DTCP Certificate.  However these DTCP-enabled devices offer
   additional functionality (e.g., via HTML5 User Agents or web enabled
   applications) that is distinct from its capability to transmit and
   play audio-visual content.  The mechanism outlined in this document
   allows a DTCP-enabled consumer electronics device to authenticate and
   authorize using its DTCP Certificate when accessing services over the
   internet; for example ,web applications on televisions that can
   enable value-added services.  This is anticipated to be very valuable
   since there are a considerable number of such devices.  The re-use of
   well-known web security will also keep such communication consistent
   with existing standards and best practices.

1.2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Overview

2.1.  Overview of DTCP Certificates

   DTCP certificates issued by [DTLA] to DTLA-compliant devices come in
   three general variations (see [DTCP], Section 4.2.3.1)

   * Restricted Authentication device certificate format (Format 0):
        Typically issued to devices with limited computation resources.

    * Baseline Full Authentication device certificate format (Format 1):

        This is the most commonly issued certificate format.  Format 1
        certificates include a unique Device ID and device EC-DSA
        public/private key pair generated by the DTLA.  (See Section 4.3
        of [DTCP])

    * Extended Full Authentication device certificate format (Format 2):

        This is issued to devices that possess additional functions
        (e.g., additional channel ciphers, specific device properties).
        The presence of these additional functions is indicated by the
        device capability mask as specified in Section 4.2.3.2 of the
        DTCP specification [DTCP].  Format 2 certificates also include a
        unique Device ID and device EC-DSA public/private key pair
        generated by the DTLA.  (See Section 4.3 of [DTCP])


   The mechanism specified in this document allows only Format 1 and
   Format 2 DTCP certificates to be exchanged in the supplemental data
   message since it requires the use of the EC-DSA private key
   associated with the certificate.

2.2.  Overview of Supplemental Data handshake

   Figure 1 illustrates the exchange of SupplementalData message during
   the TLS handshake as specified in [RFC4680] and is repeated here for
   convenience:

2.3.  Overview of authorization extensions

   [RFC5878] defines two authorization extension types that are used in
   the ClientHello and ServerHello messages and are repeated below for
   convenience:


         enum {
           client_authz(7), server_authz(8), (65535)
         } ExtensionType;


   A client uses the client_authz and server_authz extensions in the
   ClientHello message to indicate that it will send client

   authorization data and receive server authorization data respectively
   in the SupplementalData messages.  A server uses the extensions in a
   similar manner in its ServerHello message.  [RFC5878] also
   establishes a registry that is maintained by IANA for registering
   authorization data formats.  This document defines a new
   authorization data type for both the client_authz and server_authz
   extensions and allows the client and server to exchange DTCP
   certificates in the SupplementalData message.

2.4.  Overview of supplemental data usage for authorization

   Section 3 of [RFC5878] specifies the syntax of the supplemental data
   message when carrying the authz_data message that is negotiated in
   the client_authz and/or server_authz types.  This document defines a
   new authorization data format that is used in the authz_data message
   when sending DTCP Authorization data.

3.  DTCP Authorization Data Format

3.1.  DTCP Authorization Type

   The DTCP Authorization type definition in the TLS Authorization Data
   Formats registry is:



          dtcp_authorization(TBA);



   Note to RFC Editor: Please populate the number assigned by IANA

3.2.  DTCP Authorization Data

   The DTCP Authorization data is used when the AuthzDataFormat type is
   dtcp_authorization.  The syntax of the authorization data is:

         struct {
             opaque random_bytes[32];
         } RandomNonce;

         struct {
             opaque RandomNonce nonce;
             opaque DTCPCert<0..2^24-1>;
             opaque ASN.1Cert<0..2^24-1>;
             opaque signature<0..2^16-1>;
         } dtcp_authz_data;



   RandomNonce is generated by the server and consists of 32 bytes
   generated by a high quality secure random number generator.  The
   client always sends back the server generated RandomNonce in its
   dtcp_authz_data structure.  The RandomNonce helps the server in
   detecting replay attacks.  A client can detect replay attacks by
   associating the ASN.1 Certificate in the dtcp_authz_data structure
   with the certificate received in the Certificate message of the TLS
   handshake so a separate nonce for the client is not required.

   DTCPCert is the sender's DTCP certificate, see Section 4.2.3.1 of the
   DTCP Specification [DTCP]

   ASN.1Cert is the sender's certificate used to establish the TLS
   session, i.e. sent in the Certificate or ClientCertificate message
   using the Certificate structure defined in Section 7.4.2 of
   [RFC5246].

   The DTCPCert and ASN.1Cert are variable length vectors as specified
   in Section 4.3 of [RFC5246].  Hence the actual length precedes the
   vector's contents in the byte stream.  If the ASN.1Cert is not being
   sent, the ASN.1Cert_length MUST be zero.

   dtcp_authz_data - contains the RandomNonce, DTCP Certificate and the
   optional ASN.1 Certificate.  This is then followed by the digital
   signature covering the RandomNonce, DTCP Certificate and the ASN.1
   certificate (if present).  The signature is generated using the
   private key associated with the DTCP certificate using the Signature
   Algorithm and Hash Algorithm as specified in Section 4.4 of [DTCP].
   This signature provides proof of the possession of the private key by
   the sender.  A sender sending its own DTCP Certificate MUST populate
   this field.  The length of the signature field is determined by the
   Signature Algorithm and Hash Algorithm as specified in Section 4.4 of
   [DTCP] and so it is not explicitly encoded in the dtcp_authz_data
   structure (e.g.  The length will be 40 bytes for SHA1+ECDSA algorithm
   combination).

3.3.  Usage rules for clients to exchange DTCP Authorization data

   A client includes both the client_authz and server_authz extensions
   in the extended client hello message when indicating its desire to
   exchange DTCP authorization data with the server.  Additionally, the
   client includes the AuthzDataFormat type specified in Section 3.1 in
   the extension_data field to specify the format of the authorization
   data.

   A client will receive the server's dtcp_authz_data before it sends
   its own dtcp_authz_data.  When sending its own dtcp_authz_data
   message, the client includes the same RandomNonce that it receives in
   the server's dtcp_authz_data message.  Clients MUST include its DTCP
   Certificate in the dtcp_authz_data message.  Clients MAY include its
   ASN.1 Certificate (certificate in the ClientCertificate message) in
   the ASN.1Cert field of the dtcp_authz_data to cryptographically tie
   the dtcp_authz_data with its ASN.1Cert being used to establish the
   TLS session (i.e. sent in the ClientCertificate message).

3.4.  Usage rules for servers to exchange DTCP Authorization data

   A server responds with both the client_authz and server_authz
   extensions in the extended server hello message when indicating its
   desire to exchange dtcp_authorization data with the client.
   Additionally, the server includes the AuthzDataFormat type specified
   in Section 3.1 in the extension_data field to specify the format of
   the dtcp_authorization data.  A client may or may not include an
   ASN.1 Cerificate during the TLS handshake.  However, the server will
   not know that at the time of sending the SupplementalData message.
   Hence a server MUST generate and populate the RandomNonce in the
   dtcp_authz_data message.  If the client's hello message does not
   contain both the client_authz and server_authz extensions with
   dtcp_authorization type, the server MUST NOT include support for
   dtcp_authorization data in its hello message.  A server MAY include
   its DTCP Certificate in the dtcp_authz_data message.  If the server
   does not send a DTCP Certificate, it will send only the RandomNonce
   in its dtcp_authz_data message.  If the server includes its DTCP
   Certificate, it MUST also include its server certificate (sent in the
   TLS Certificate message) in the certs field to cryptographically tie
   its dtcp_authz_data with the ASN.1 Certificate used in the TLS
   session being established.  This also helps the client in detecting
   replay attacks.

3.5.  TLS message exchange with dtcp_authz_data

   Based on the usage rules in the sections above, Figure 2 (Figure 2)
   below provides one possible TLS message exchange where the client

3.6.  Alert Messages

   This document reuses TLS Alert messages for any errors that arise
   during authorization processing, and reuses the AlertLevels as
   specified in [RFC5878].  Additionally the following AlertDescription
   values are used to report errors in dtcp_authorization processing:

       unsupported_extension:
         During processing of dtcp_authorization, a client uses this
         when it receives a server hello message that includes support
         for dtcp_authorization in only one of client_authz or
         server_authz but not in both the extensions.
         This message is always fatal.
         Note: Completely omitting the dtcp_authorization extension
         and/or omitting the client_authz and server_authz completely
         is allowed and should not constitute the reason that this
         alert is sent.

       certificate_unknown:
         During processing of dtcp_authorization, a client or server
         uses this when it has received an X.509 certificate in the
         dtcp_authorization data and that X.509 certificate does
         not match the certificate sent in the corresponding
         ClientCertificate or Certificate message.



4.  IANA Considerations

   This document proposes a new entry to be registered in the IANA-
   maintained TLS Authorization Data Formats registry for
   dtcp_authorization(TBA).  This registry is defined in [RFC5878] and
   defines two ranges: one is IETF review and the other is specification
   required.  The value for dtcp_authorization should be assigned via
   [RFC5226] Specification Required.  The extension defined in this
   document is compatible with DTLS [RFC6347] and the registry
   assignment should be marked "Y" for DTLS-OK.

   Note to RFC Editor: Please populate the number assigned by IANA in
   TBA above.

5.  Security Considerations

   The dtcp_authorization data as specified in this document carries the
   DTCP Certificate that identifies the associated device.  Inclusion of
   the X.509 Certificate being used to establish a TLS Session in the
   dtcp_authorization data allows an application to cryptographically
   tie them.  However a TLS Client is not required to (and may not
   possess) an X.509 Certificate.  In this case, the dtcp_authorization
   data exchange is prone to a man-in-the-middle attack.  In such
   situations, a TLS server MUST deny access to the application features
   dependent on the DTCP Certificate or use a double handshake.  The
   double handshake mechanism is also vulnerable to the TLS MITM
   Renegotiation exploit as explained in [RFC5746].  In order to address
   this vulnerability, clients and servers MUST use the

   secure_renegotiation extension as specified in [RFC5746] when
   exchanging dtcp_authorization data.  Additionally, the renegotiation
   is also vulnerable to the Triple Handshake exploit.  To mitigate
   this, servers MUST use the same ASN.1 certificate during
   renegotiation as the one used in the initial handshake.

   It should be noted that for double handshake to succeed, any
   extension (e.g., TLS Session Ticket [RFC5077]) that results in the
   TLS Handshake sequence being modified may result in failure to
   exchange SupplementalData.

   Additionally the security considerations specified in [RFC5878] and
   [RFC5246] apply to the extension specified in this document.  In
   addition, the dtcp_authorization data may be carried along with other
   supplemental data or some other authorization data and that
   information may require additional protection.  Finally, implementers
   should also reference [DTCP] and [DTCP-IP] for more information
   regarding DTCP certificates, their usage and associated security
   considerations.

Appendix A.  Additional Stuff

   This document specifies a TLS authorization data extension that
   allows TLS clients and servers to exchange DTCP certificates during a
   TLS handshake exchange.  In cases where the supplemental data
   contains sensitive information, the double handshake technique
   described in [RFC4680] can be used to provide protection for the
   supplemental data information.  The double handshake specified in
   [RFC4680] assumes that the client knows the context of the TLS
   session that is being set up and uses the authorization extensions as
   needed.  Figure 3 illustrates a variation of the double handshake
   that addresses the case where the client may not have a priori
   knowledge that it will be communicating with a server capable of
   exchanging dtcp_authz_data (typical for https connections; see
   [RFC2818]).  In Figure 3 (Figure 3), the client's Hello messages
   includes the client_authz and server_authz extensions.  The server
   simply establishes an encrypted TLS session with the client in the
   first handshake by not indicating support for any authz extensions.
   The server initiates a second handshake by sending a HelloRequest.
   The second handshake will include server's support for authz
   extensions which will result in SupplementalData being exchanged.

   Alternately, it is also possible to do a double handshake where the
   server sends the authorization extensions during both the first and
   the second handshake.  Depending on the information received in the
   first handshake, the server can decide if a second handshake is
   needed or not.
