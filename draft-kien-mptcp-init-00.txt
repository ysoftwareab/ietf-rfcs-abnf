                 An Improvement of MPTCP Initialization
                        draft-kien-mptcp-init-00

Abstract

   This draft describes a new method of connection initialization for
   Multipath TCP (MPTCP).  In the current implementation, the MPTCP's
   first subflow needs to be successfully initialized before an
   additional flow takes its turn.  This yields to a degradation of
   MPTCP benefit in many use cases (e.g., transferring short flows).  To
   overcome the problem, we propose to duplicate the first SYN packet
   and send the duplicating ones via multiple interfaces.

1.  Introduction

   MPTCP is an evolvable and efficient tool for link aggregation, e.g.,
   on multi-homing hosts in mobile wireless networks.  The flexibility
   of adding and deleting subflows introduce MPTCP benefits in
   aggregation and soft handover in many use cases.  In the current
   implementation, MPTCP shows several drawbacks including operations in
   a scenario with imbalanced paths, especially handling short flows.
   Since a large amount of Internet TCP traffic is short flows, MPTCP
   should be improved to be more suitable with the traffic pattern.  In
   the such scenario, the problem of selection of initialization path
   has big impacts on the MPTCP performance.  It has been proven by the
   theoretical analysis [analysis] and real measurements [measurement].
   However, there are limited works on solving the problem.

   In fact, MPTCP can not choose the initial path itself.  MPTCP relies
   on routing information to determine the destination for the
   initialization.  The routing is static in most cases.  The host is
   normally configured to route all the traffic through a default
   gateway.  As a result, the first SYN of initialization has to be sent
   to the gateway associated network regardless of its quality.  On the
   other hand, the routing information is available on a host for
   supporting beneficial operations of MPTCP.  To solve the mentioned
   problem, we propose to duplicate the first SYN packet.  The available
   routing information is leveraged in sending the duplications through
   several networks.  The first received SYN/ACK is determined the best
   network (i.e., the one with the smallest RTT) to initialize the MPTCP
   connection.

2.  Problem Description

   This section describes the limitation of the current implementation
   of MPTCP.  Consider an example scenario of MPTCP communication
   between two host (host A and host B).  MPTCP on host A with multiple
   addresses (i.e., two addresses A1, A2) communicates with host B via
   network A1, A2, respectively.  In this scenario, the gateway
   associated with address A1 is the default.  Obviously, Host A send
   the first SYN with MP_CAPABLE to Address B1 for MPTCP initialization.
   After the successful initialization, the additional subflow will be
   added to ongoing MPTCP transmissions following one of two methods.
   The later subflow is initialized a new SYNC+MP_JOIN from A2 to B1 if
   there is no NAT between them.  In case of under NAT, the SYN+MP_JOIN
   will be added after sending MP_ADDADDR.

   For long flows, the standard mechanism works well, even the quality
   of services provided by the network A1 and network A2 are different.
   However, if the network A1 has longer Round Trip Time (RTT) than the
   one of network A2.  The MPTCP performance is degraded, especially in
   the case of short flows.  Besides, the similar scenario will become
   popular since the different network technologies are emerging
   especially for the next generation of mobile networks.  Therefore, it
   is necessary and important to solve the problem.

3.  Proposal

   Our proposal for solving the previous problem relies on the idea of
   packet duplication, specifically SYN duplication.  The first SYN in
   initialization is duplicated.  The newly created SYN packets are then
   sent through the multiple gateways.  The proposal only requires a
   modifications in sending/receiving procedures of MPTCP.

   We describe an beneficial use case of the proposal, which is similar
   to the scenario mentioned in Section 3.  Note that, the network A2
   has shorter RTT than the one of network A1.  Initially, the key is
   generated on host A for the first SYN.  The first SYN is constructed
   just like as in the standard.  The SYN is also included MP_CAPABLE
   option.  Additionally, the second SYN is newly constructed with the
   same content.  The only difference is on the layer 3 source
   addresses.  More specifically, the source-destination pair is (A1,
   B1) on the first, and (A2, B1) on the second SYN, respectively.
   Concurrently, the two SYNs are departed from host A to host B.  This
   task is feasible when the routing information is available for the
   departures.

   At the host B, the early arriving SYN (i.e., the one from A2 to B1)
   is received.  The host B then sends an acknowledgment (SYN/ACK with
   MP_CAPABLE) to A2.  We can observe that without modification of the

   default gateway information, MPTCP has a good path selection via
   Network A2 for initialization.  Further consideration is that, the
   later acknowledgment (SYN/ACK to B1) is used for an additional
   subflow (i.e., similar to MP_JOIN).  Following the further operation,
   the whole period of MPTCP initialization is shortened comparing to
   the one in current implementation.  Another obvious benefit of SYN
   duplications is enhancing the resilience of SYN transmission.
