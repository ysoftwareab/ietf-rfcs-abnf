U-bit = 1
       Unknown TLV bit.  Upon receipt of an unknown TLV, due to U-bit
       being set (=1), the unknown TLV MUST be silently ignored and the
       rest of the message processed as if the unknown TLV did not
       exist. In case requested route is not available, the downstream
       LSR MUST ignore this unknown TLV and send a "no route"
       notification back. Ensures backward compatibility.

F-bit = 0
       Forward unknown TLV bit.  This bit applies only when the U-bit is
       set and the LDP message containing the unknown TLV is to be
       forwarded.  Due to F-bit being clear (=0), the unknown TLV is not
       forwarded with the containing message.

Length = 0x00
       Specifies the length of the Value field in octets.
