Abstract

   The protocol described in this document is a member of the IP  Device
   Control  (IPDC) family of protocols.  The IPDC protocols are proposed
   as a protocol suite, components of which can be used individually  or
   together  to perform connection control, media control, and signaling
   transport  for  environments  where  the  service  control  logic  is
   separated  from  the network access server. Please see the references
   section for other IPDC documents.

   The protocol specification presented here is intended for use between
   a  media  gateway  controller and a media gateway.  The media gateway
   may be capable of acting as a voice over IP gateway, voice  over  ATM
   gateway,  dialup  modem  media  gateway,  circuit  switch,  or cross-
   connect.  Using the IP Device Management protocol presented here, the
   media  gateway  controller can obtain status and receive notification
   of  management  events  from  the  Media  Gateway  or  between  Media

INTERNET DRAFT		IPDC Device Management Protocol		August 1998


1.0  Introduction

   The protocol specification presented here is intended for use between
   centralized  switch  control  logic or Media Gateway Controller and a
   Media Gateway.  The Media Gateway may  be  capable  of  acting  as  a
   circuit switch, voice over IP gateway, dialup modem access server, or
   other messaging/conference server functions.   Using  the  IP  Device
   Management   protocol   within   this  document,  the  Media  Gateway
   Controller can obtain status and receive notification  of  management
   events from the Media Gateway or between Media Gateways.

1.1 Background

   This  protocol  is  part  of  the  IP Device Control (IPDC) family of
   protocols.  The IPDC protocols have been proposed as a protocol suite
   that  can  be  used  individually  or  together to perform connection
   control,  media  control,  status   and   signaling   transport   for
   environments  where  the  service control logic is separated from the
   network Media Gateway.  Please see the references section  for  other
   IPDC documents.

   This  document  describes the commands and attribute value pairs that
   are necessary within the IPDC protocol to  allow  the  Media  Gateway
   Controller  to  be notified of status and management functions on the
   Media Gateway.  The intent of the protocol  is  to  leverage  and  be
   aware  of  the functions and service that other management facilities
   provide.  By assuming that there are other management facilities, the
   protocol  can  be  streamlined  and be used for only basic management
   functions that may impact the Media Gateway Controller functionality.
   It  is  also  assumed that configuration of the Media Gateway is done
   through separate means.  Although notification of some  configuration
   changes  are  enabled, full provisioning and configuration requires a
   separate set of functions and are not a part of this protocol.

   This basic management protocol provides the Media Gateway  Controller
   with  start-up,  configuration notification, status and basic testing
   facilities.  Startup notifications to the  Media  Gateway  Controller
   include system reboot, initialization and restarting of Media Gateway
   subsystems.   Configuration   notifications   allow   Media   Gateway
   Controller to be notified if any configuration event occurs including
   those utilizing  proprietary  means.   These  configurations  can  be
   through  SNMP  transactions  or  other  configuration  methods.   The
   protocol also allows for indication of testing procedures  and  tools
   that  can  be  in  operation on the Media Gateway.  These tests could
   have an impact on the Media Gateway Controller core functions and are
   thus taken into account in the protocol.

2.1 Specification of Requirements

   In  this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

   MUST  This  word,  or  the  adjective  "required",  means  that   the
   definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.


   MUST  NOT  This  phrase  means  that  the  definition  is an absolute
   prohibition of the specification.


   SHOULD This word, or the adjective "recommended",  means   there  may
   exist  valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore this item,
   but the full implications must be understood  and  carefully  weighed
   before choosing a different course.


   MAY  This  word, or the adjective "optional", means that this item is
   one of an allowed set of alternatives.  An implementation which  does
   not include this option MUST be prepared to interoperate with another
   implementation which does include the option.

2.2 Messages

   This section describes the IP Device Management (IPDM) commands  that
   are described within this document.

2.3 Restart

   The  media  gateway  sends  a  RSIP  message  to  the  media  gateway
   controller when a management system directs it to restart.  The  RSIP
   message  initiates  a  transaction identified per IPDC base document.
   The transaction completes when the media gateway  controller  returns
   an Acknowledgement message to the media gateway.

   On  a  forced restart, the media gateway controller immediately sends
   the Acknowledgement message to the media gateway.

   On a graceful restart, the  media  gateway  controller  releases  all
   resources it is using on the media gateway before responding with the
   Acknowledgment message.

   The media gateway can unilaterally complete the  restart  transaction
   if  it does not receive an Acknowledgement within the specified time.

   Transaction Originator Host Name AVP

      The host name of the initiator of the  transaction.    This  is  a
      required parameter for all IPDC protocol messages.

   Restart Method AVP

      This field MUST specify one of the following values:
         00000001  Forced Restart
         00000002  Graceful Restart

      This is a required parameter.

   Restart Time AVP

      This field specifies number of seconds the media gateway waits for
      an  Acknowledgement  from  the  media  gateway  controller  before
      restarting.   This is a required parameter.

2.4 Configuration and Status

   The  media  gateway  controller may send a Request Information (RINF)
   message to a media gateway, which  instructs  the  media  gateway  to
   respond  with  a  Notify  Information  (NINF)  message containing the
   requested information.   The  RINF  begins  a  transaction,  and  the
   corresponding  NINF  ends  the  transaction.   The media gateway MUST
   respond to a RINF message with a NINF or Message Reject message.

   The media gateway  controller  may  send  a  Set  Information  (SINF)
   message  to  the  media gateway, which instructs the media gateway to
   set some  limited  configuration  values.   The  media  gateway  MUST
   respond  to  a  SINF  message with an NINF or Message Reject message.
   The NINF or Message Reject message completes the transaction.

   The media gateway can send unsolicited NINF  messages  to  the  media
   gateway  controller  to  inform  it  of  changes  made  to its system
   information by other management systems.  An unsolicited NINF message
   initiates  a  transaction,  and the transaction is completed when the
   media gateway controller returns either a Command Acknowledgement  or
   a Message Reject.
