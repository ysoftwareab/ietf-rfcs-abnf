Abstract

   This draft proposes crankback routing extensions for CR-LDP
   signaling.  Recently, several routing protocol extensions for
   advertising resource information in addition to topology information
   have been proposed for use in distributed constraint-based routing.
   In such a distributed routing environment, however, the information
   used to compute a constraint-based path may be out of date. This
   means that label requests may be blocked by links or nodes without
   sufficient resources. This draft specifies crankback routing
   extensions for CR-LDP so that the label request can be retried on an
   alternate path that detours around the blocked link or node upon a
   setup failure. Furthermore, the proposed crankback routing schemes
   can be also applied to end-to-end LSP restoration by indicating the

   location of the failure link or node. This would significantly
   improve the recovery ratio for failed LSPs, especially in situations
   where a large number of setup requests are triggered at the same
   time.

1. Introduction

   CR-LDP (Constraint-based Routing Label Distribution Protocol) is
   defined in [CR-LDP] for establishing explicitly routed LSPs (CR-LSPs)
   in an MPLS network. Using CR-LDP, resources can also be reserved
   along a path to guarantee or control QoS for traffic carried on the
   CR-LSP. To designate an explicit path that satisfies QoS constraints,
   it is necessary to discern the resources available to each link or
   node in the network. For the collection of such resource information,
   routing protocols, such as OSPF [OSPF], can be extended to distribute
   additional state information [LI]. Explicit paths can be designated
   based on the distributed information at the LSR initiating a CR-LSP
   and, if necessary, intermediate gateway LSRs.

   In a distributed routing environment, however, the resource
   information used to compute a constraint-based path may be out of
   date. This means that a setup request may be blocked, for example,
   because a link or node along the selected path has insufficient
   resources. When a setup failure occurs, a notification is returned to
   the setup initiator (ingress LSR). In the current CR-LDP, the ingress
   LSR receiving the notification has to terminate the message and give
   up the LSP establishment.

   If the ingress or intermediate gateway LSR knows the location of the
   blocked link or node, the LSR can designate an alternate path and
   then reissue the setup request, which can be achieved by the
   mechanism known as crankback routing [PNNI, ASH]. We propose the use
   of crankback routing in CR-LDP. Crankback routing requires notifying
   an upstream LSR of the location of the blocked link or node.

   On the other hand, various restoration schemes for link or node
   failures have been proposed in [SWALLOW, MAKAM, SHARMA] and others.
   Fast restoration by pre-establishing a backup LSP is useful for
   failures on a primary LSP. If both the primary and backup paths fail,
   however, it is necessary to repair the LSP on an end-to-end basis.
   End-to-end restoration for alternate routing requires the location of
   the failed link or node. A proposed crankback routing schemes could
   also be used to notify upstream LSRs of the location of the failure.
   Furthermore, in situations where many link or node failures occur at
   the same time, the difference between the distributed routing
   information and the real-time network state becomes much greater than
   in normal LSP setups. The LSP restoration must therefore be performed
   with inaccurate information, which is likely to cause setup blocking.

   Crankback routing would also improve failure recovery in these
   situations.

   Recently, Multi-Protocol Lambda Switching has also been discussed. In
   a network without wavelength converters, setup requests are likely to
   be blocked more often than in a conventional MPLS environment because
   the same wavelength must be allocated at each OXC on an end-to-end
   explicit path. Furthermore, end-to-end restoration is the only way to
   recover LSP failures [CHAUDHURI]. This implies that crankback routing
   would also be useful in an MPLambdaS network. This draft proposes a
   crankback routing system that is an extension of CR-LDP and discusses
   the identification of blocked links or nodes in an MPLS network.

   Although we address CR-LDP as the label distribution technique in the
   following, a similar discussion can be applied to TE-RSVP [TE-RSVP].

2. Crankback Routing Behaviors

   Crankback routing can be performed in the following situation.

     a. A setup request is blocked.

     b. An established LSP fails.

   Although crankback routing can be done on a hop-by-hop basis, which
   may be useful for fast restoration, we address source-route based
   crankback routing in this draft.

2.1. Crankback Routing due to Setup Request Blockage

   When a label request is blocked due to unavailable resources, a
   notification message with a Rerouting TLV with the location
   identifier of the blockage, is returned to the LSR initiating the
   label request (ingress LSR). The notification message is called a
   "crankback notification". It may include information such as
   bandwidth availability, as described in [ASHW]. This issue is left
   for further study.

   In a flat network without segmentation, the ingress LSR receives the
   message and designates an alternate path around the blocked link or
   node to satisfy QoS constraints using link state information about
   the area. If an alternate path is found, a new label request is sent
   over this path. In a network segmented into areas such as
   hierarchical OSPF, the area border node may terminate the crankback
   notification and then perform alternate routing instead of the
   ingress LSR.

   The LSR that computed the alternate path stores the location

Internet Draft                                                March 2000


   identifiers of the blockages indicated in a crankback notification
   until it receives a corresponding label mapping message. Upon
   receiving a crankback notification again after retrying a label
   request, another alternate path is computed based on the previous
   blocked links or nodes in the stored information as well as the
   current ones in the received notification message.

   Optionally, the maximum number of crankback routing allowed for
   establishing an LSP may be limited. This is useful to prevent a
   endless repetition of crankback routing in certain error conditions.
   It is also useful for reducing the number of unnecessary retries,
   which do not improve performance. When crankback notifications exceed
   the threshold, the message that exceeded the threshold is processed
   as an ordinary (non-crankback) notification and no more label
   requests are issued. Other mechanisms for controlling crankback
   routing can also be used.

2.2. Crankback Routing due to LSP Failures

   When an LSR detects a fault on an adjacent downstream link or node, a
   label withdraw message is sent upstream over a CR-LSP configured on
   the LSR. Each LSR receiving the message then releases the
   corresponding LSP. If the failed LSP is expected to be restored at an
   upstream LSR, the Rerouting TLV with the location information of the
   fault link or node is included in a label withdraw message. The
   ingress or intermediate gateway LSR receiving the message can
   terminate this messages and then perform alternate routing.

   On the downstream side of the failure, an LSR detecting the failure
   sends a label release message over a CR-LSP configured on the LSR.
   The egress or intermediate gateway LSR receiving the message can
   terminate this message and wait until the new label request for
   restoration is received.

   Other behaviors are the same as those of performing crankback routing
   upon setup request blockage.

3. Location Identifiers of Blocked Links or Nodes

   In order to compute an alternate path by crankback routing, it is
   necessary to identify where blocked links or nodes are. The common
   identifier of each link or node in an MPLS network should be
   specified. We propose both protocol-independent and protocol-
   dependent identifiers. Although a general identifier that is
   independent of other protocols is preferable, there are a couple of
   restrictions on its use.

   In a CR-LDP label request, an explicit route can be represented as a



Fujita & Iwata  draft-fujita-mpls-crldp-crankback-00.txt        [Page 4]

Internet Draft                                                March 2000


   list of ER-Hop TLVs in the ER-TLV. The first ER-Hop TLV is removed
   when the label request is sent to the next abstract node. Therefore,
   we propose that the blockage location be represented using the top
   ER-Hop TLVs upon a blockage. In the case of a node blockage, the
   first ER-Hop TLV is returned in a crankback notification. Upon a link
   blockage, the first and second ER-Hop TLVs is returned, which means
   that the blockage location is the link between the two nodes
   indicated by these TLVs. If the abstract node described by the ER-Hop
   TLV is represented by a strict hop with a prefix length of 32, this
   indicates one IP address of a single IPv4 node. If this condition is
   met, the indication of the blockage location by the ER-Hop TLVs
   allows an ingress or intermediate gateway LSR to compute an alternate
   path to detour just the link/node. If not, the link or node where a
   setup failure occurred probably will not be identified. Furthermore,
   if an initial label request is traversed with hop-by-hop routing, the
   label request message does not have an ER-TLV. These examples imply
   that ER-Hop TLVs cannot always be used as the location identifier of
   a blockage. An alternate indicator of such blocked links or nodes is
   required.

   In link state protocols such as OSPF and IS-IS, each link and node in
   a network can be uniquely identified. For example, the OSPF protocol
   uses Router ID as the node identifier and the combination of Router
   ID and Link ID as the link identifier. If the topology and resource
   information obtained by OSPF advertisements is used to compute a
   constraint-based path, the location of a blockage can be represented
   by such identifiers. We also propose protocol-specific link or node
   identifiers that can be used for multiple routing protocols. In this
   draft, we specify identifications for OSPF and IS-IS. Extension for
   other routing protocols, such as BGP, etc., can be easily applied but
   is left for further study.

   Although a general link/node identifier in a network is preferable,
   it is difficult to specify it because MPLS signaling protocols are
   independent of routing protocols. This issue is left for further
   study.

4. Additional TLVs

   In this section, we define additional TLVs included in notification
   and label withdraw messages.

4.1. Rerouting TLV

   When resource allocation for a label request is not allowed, a
   notification message is returned. In a network where crankback
   routing is supported, the Rerouting TLV is included in the
   notification message. This message must carry the LSPID TLV of the



Fujita & Iwata  draft-fujita-mpls-crldp-crankback-00.txt        [Page 5]

Internet Draft                                                March 2000


   corresponding CR-LSP. The Status TLV included in the notification
   message indicates the cause of the problem. Additional status codes
   can be added to the current defined ones to give more detail about
   the blockage such as "Reserved" and "Heavily Loaded" [ASH].

   If LSP restoration is supported, the Rerouting TLV is included in
   label withdraw messages caused by network failures. The message must
   also carry the LSPID TLV of the corresponding CR-LSP. The Status TLV
   can be also included to indicate the cause of the problem.
