QQI = (mant | 0x10) << (exp + 3)

MulticastRouterVersion = 3.  The algorithm for determining
A = set of source records whose source timers > 0
     (Sources that at least one host has requested to be forwarded)
B = set of source records whose source timers = 0
     (Sources that IGMP will suggest to the routing protocol not to
      forward)
