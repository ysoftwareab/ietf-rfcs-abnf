  Pub-Sub Profile for Authentication and Authorization for Constrained
                           Environments (ACE)
                    draft-ietf-ace-pubsub-profile-04

Abstract

   This specification defines an application profile for authentication
   and authorization for Publishers and Subscribers in a constrained
   pub-sub scenario, using the ACE framework.  This profile relies on
   transport layer or application layer security to authorize the pub-
   sub clients to the broker.  Moreover, it describes the use of
   application layer security to protect the content of the pub-sub
   client message exchange through the broker.  The profile covers pub-
   sub scenarios using either the Constrained Application Protocol
   (CoAP) [I-D.ietf-core-coap-pubsub] or the Message Queue Telemetry
   Transport (MQTT) [MQTT-OASIS-Standard-v5] protocol.

1.  Introduction

   In the publish-subscribe (pub-sub) scenario, devices with limited
   reachability communicate via a broker, which enables store-and-
   forward messaging between the devices.  This document defines a way
   to authorize pub-sub clients using the ACE framework
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz] to obtain the keys for protecting the
   content of their pub-sub messages when communicating through the
   broker.  The pub-sub communication using the Constrained Application
   Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap-pubsub], while the one using MQTT is specified in
   [MQTT-OASIS-Standard-v5].  This document gives detailed
   specifications for MQTT and CoAP pub-sub, but can easily be adapted
   for other transport protocols as well.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz],
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm].  In particular, analogously to
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], terminology for entities in the
   architecture such as Client (C), Resource Server (RS), and
   Authorization Server (AS) is defined in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] and
   [I-D.ietf-ace-actors], and terminology for entities such as the Key
   Distribution Center (KDC) and Dispatcher in
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm].

   Readers are expected to be familiar with terms and concepts of pub-
   sub group communication, as described in [I-D.ietf-core-coap-pubsub],
   or MQTT [MQTT-OASIS-Standard-v5].

2.  Application Profile Overview

   The objective of this document is to specify how to authorize nodes,
   provide keys, and protect a pub-sub communication, using
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm], which expands from the ACE framework
   ([I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]), and transport profiles
   ([I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize], [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile],
   [I-D.ietf-ace-mqtt-tls-profile]).  The pub-sub communication protocol
   can be based on CoAP, as described in [I-D.ietf-core-coap-pubsub],
   MQTT [MQTT-OASIS-Standard-v5] , or other transport.  Note that both
   Publishers and Subscribers use the same pub-sub communication
   protocol and the same transport profile of ACE in their interaction
   with the broker.  However, all clients need to use CoAP when

   The architecture of the scenario is shown in Figure 1.

   Publisher or Subscriber Clients is referred to as Client in short.  A
   Client can act both as a publisher and a subscriber, publishing to
   some topics, and subscribing to others.  However, for the simplicity
   of presentation, this profile describes Publisher and Subscriber
   clients separately.  The Broker acts as the ACE RS, and also
   corresponds to the Dispatcher in [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm]).

   This profile specifies:

   1.  The establishment of a secure connection between a Client and
       Broker, using an ACE transport profile such as DTLS
       [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize], OSCORE
       [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile], or MQTT-TLS
       [I-D.ietf-ace-mqtt-tls-profile] (A and C).

   2.  The Clients retrieval of keying material for the Publisher Client
       to publish protected publications to the Broker, and for the
       Subscriber Client to read protected publications (B).

   These exchanges aim at setting up two different security
   associations.  On the one hand, the Publisher and the Subscriber
   clients have a security association with the Broker, so that, as the
   ACE RS, it can verify that the Clients are authorized (Security

   Association 1).  On the other hand, the Publisher has a security
   association with the Subscriber, to protect the publication content
   (Security Association 2) while sending it through the broker.  The
   Security Association 1 is set up using AS and a transport profile of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], the Security Association 2 is set up
   using AS, KDC and [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm].  Note that, given
   that the publication content is protected, the Broker MAY accept
   unauthorised Subscribers.  In this case, the Subscriber client can
   skip setting up Security Association 1 with the Broker and connect to
   it as an anonymous client to subscribe to topics of interest at the
   Broker.

3.  PubSub Authorisation

   Since [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz] recommends the use of CoAP and CBOR,
   this document describes the exchanges assuming CoAP and CBOR are
   used.  However, using HTTP instead of CoAP is possible, using the
   corresponding parameters and methods.  Analogously, JSON [RFC8259]
   can be used instead of CBOR, using the conversion method specified in
   Sections 6.1 and 6.2 of [RFC8949].  In case JSON is used, the Content
   Format or Media Type of the message has to be changed accordingly.
   Exact definition of these exchanges are considered out of scope for
   this document.

   Figure 3 shows the message flow for authorisation purposes.

                        Figure 3: Authorisation Flow

3.1.  AS Discovery (Optional)

   Complementary to what is defined in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]
   (Section 5.1) for AS discovery, the Broker MAY send the address of
   the AS to the Client in the 'AS' parameter in the AS Information as a
   response to an Unauthorized Resource Request (Section 5.2).  An
   example using CBOR diagnostic notation and CoAP is given below:

                4.01 Unauthorized
                Content-Format: application/ace-groupcomm+cbor
                {"AS": "coaps://as.example.com/token"}

                      Figure 4: AS Information example

   Authorisation Server (AS) Discovery is also defined in
   Section 2.2.6.1 of [I-D.ietf-ace-mqtt-tls-profile] for MQTT v5
   clients (and not supported for MQTT v3 clients).

3.2.  Authorising to the KDC and the Broker

   After retrieving the AS address, the Client sends two Authorisation
   Requests to the AS for the KDC and the Broker, respectively.

   Note that the AS authorises what topics a Client is allowed to
   Publish or Subscribe to the Broker, which means authorising which
   application and security groups a Client can join.  This is because
   being able to publish or subscribe to a topic at the Broker is
   considered as being part of an application group.  As this profile
   secures the message contents, an application group may be a part of a
   security group, or can be associated to multiple security groups.
   Therefore, a Client MUST send Authorization Requests for both.

Internet-Draft               pubsub-profile                December 2021


   Both requests include the following fields from the Authorization
   Request (Section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm]):

   *  'scope', containing the group identifiers, that the Client wishes
      to access

   *  'audience', an identifier, corresponding to either the KDC or the
      Broker.  Other additional parameters can be included if necessary,
      as defined in [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

   It must be noted that for pub-sub brokers, the scope represents pub-
   sub topics i.e., the application group.  On the other hand, for the
   KDC, the scope represents the security group.  If there is a one-to-
   one mapping between the application group and the security group, the
   client uses the same scope for both requests.  If there is not a one-
   to-one mapping, the correct policies regarding both sets of scopes
   MUST be available to the AS.  To be able to join the right security
   group associated with requested application groups (i.e., pub-sub
   topics), the client The client MUST ask for the correct scopes in its
   Authorization Requests.  How the client discovers the (application
   group, security group) association is out of scope of this document.
   ToDo: Check OSCORE Groups with the CoRE Resource Directory to see if
   it applies.

   The 'scope' parameter is encoded as follows, where 'gname' is treated
   as topic identifier or filter.

              gname = tstr

              role = tstr

              scope_entry = [ gname , ? ( role / [ 2*role ] ) ]

              scope = << [ + scope_entry ] >>

      Figure 5: CDLL definition of scope, using as example group name
                     encoded as tstr and role as tstr.

   Other scope representations are also possible and are described in
   (Section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm]).  Note that in the AIF-
   MQTT data model described in Section 3 of the
   [I-D.ietf-ace-mqtt-tls-profile], the role values have been further
   constrained to "pub" and "sub".

   The AS responds with an Authorization Response to each request as
   defined in Section 5.8.2 of [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz] and
   Section 3.2 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm].  The client needs to
   keep track of which response corresponds to which entity to use the

   right token for the right audience, i.e., the KDC or the Broker.  In
   case CoAP PubSub is used as communication protocol, 'profile' claim
   is set to "coap_pubsub_app" as defined in Section 8.1.1.  In case
   MQTT PubSub is used as communication protocol, 'profile' claim is set
   to "mqtt_pubsub_app" as defined in Section 8.1.2.

4.  Key Distribution for PubSub Content Protection

4.1.  Token POST

   After receiving a token from the AS, the Client posts the token to
   the KDC (Section 3.3 [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm]).  In addition to
   the token post, a Subscriber Client MAY ask for the format of the
   public keys in the group, used for source authentication, as well as
   any other group parameters.  In this case, the message MUST have
   Content-Format set to "application/ace+cbor" defined in Section 8.16
   of [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  The message payload MUST be formatted
   as a CBOR map, which MUST include the access token and the
   'sign_info' parameter.  The details for the 'sign_info' parameter can
   be found in Section 3.3 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm].
   Alternatively, the joining node may retrieve this information by
   other means as described in [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm].

   The KDC verifies the token to check of the Client is authorized to
   access the topic with the requested role.  After successful
   verification, the Client is authorized to receive the group keying
   material from the KDC and join the group.  The KDC replies to the
   Client with a 2.01 (Created) response, using Content-Format
   "application/ace+cbor".  The payload of the 2.01 response is a CBOR
   map.

   A Publisher Client MUST send its own public key to the KDC when
   joining the group.  Since the access token from a Publisher Client
   will have "pub" role, the KDC MUST include 'kdcchallenge' in the CBOR
   map, specifying a dedicated challenge N_S generated by the KDC.  The
   Client uses this challenge to prove possession of its own private key
   (see [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm] for details).

4.2.  Join Request and Join Response

   In the next step, a joining node MUST have a secure communication
   association established with the KDC, before starting to join a group
   under that KDC.  Possible ways to provide a secure communication
   association are described in the DTLS transport profile

   After establishing a secure communication, the Client sends a Joining
   Request to the KDC as described in Section 4.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm].  More specifically, the Client sends a
   POST request to the /ace-group/GROUPNAME endpoint on KDC, with
   Content-Format "application/ace-groupcomm+cbor" that MUST contain in
   the payload (formatted as a CBOR map, Section 4.1.2.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm]):

   *  'scope' parameter set to the specific group that the Client is
      attempting to join, i.e., the group name, and the roles it wishes
      to have in the group.  This value corresponds to one scope entry,
      as defined in Section 3.2.

   *  'get_pub_keys' parameter set to the empty array if the Client
      needs to retrieve the public keys of the other pubsub members,

   *  'client_cred' parameter containing the Client's public key
      formatted according to the encoding of the public keys used in the
      group, if the Client is a Publisher,

   *  'cnonce', encoded as a CBOR byte string, and including a dedicated
      nonce N_C generated by the Client, if 'client_cred' is present,

   *  'client_cred_verify', set to a signature computed over the
      'rsnonce' concatenated with cnonce, if 'client_cred' is present,

   *  OPTIONALLY, if needed, the 'pub_keys_repos' parameter

   TODO: Check 'cnonce'

   Note that for a Subscriber-only Client, the Joining Request MUST NOT
   contain the 'client_cred parameter', the role element in the 'scope'
   parameter MUST be set to "sub".  The Subscriber MUST have access to
   the public keys of all the Publishers; this MAY be achieved in the
   Joining Request by using the parameter 'get_pub_keys' encoding the
   CBOR simple value 'null' (0xf6) (as described in Section 4.3.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm]) to retrieve the public keys of all the
   Publishers.

   If the 'client_cred' parameter is present, KDC stores the public key
   of the Client.  Note that the alg parameter in the 'client_cred'
   COSE_Key MUST be a signing algorithm, as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs] [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct],
   and that it is the same algorithm used to compute the signature sent
   in 'client_cred_verify'.

   The KDC responds with a Joining Response, which has the Content-
   Format "application/ace-groupcomm+cbor".  The payload (formatted as a
   CBOR map) MUST contain the following fields from the Joining Response
   (Section 4.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm]):

   *  'gkty' identifies a key type for the 'key' parameter.

   *  'key', which contains a "COSE_Key" object (defined in
      [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs][I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct],
      containing:

      -  'kty' with value 4 (symmetric)

      -  'alg' with value defined by the AS (Content Encryption
         Algorithm)

      -  'Base IV' with value defined by the AS

      -  'k' with value the symmetric key value

      -  OPTIONALLY, 'kid' with an identifier for the key value

   *  OPTIONALLY, 'exp' with the expiration time of the key

   *  'pub_keys', containing the public keys of all Publisher Clients,
      formatted according to the public key encoding for the group, if
      the 'get_pub_keys' parameter was present and set to the empty
      array in the Key Distribution Request.  For Subscriber Clients,
      the Joining Response MUST contain the 'pub_keys' parameter.  The
      encoding accepted for this document is UCCS (Unprotectec CWT
      Claims Set) [I-D.draft-ietf-rats-uccs-01].  ToDo: Consider
      allowing other public key formats with the following text.  If
      CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs) or CWT Claims Sets (CCSs) [RFC8392] are
      used as public key format, the public key algorithm is fully
      described by a COSE key type and its "kty" and "crv" parameters.
      If X.509 certificates [RFC7925] or C509 certificates
      [I-D.ietf-cose-cbor-encoded-cert] are used as public key format,
      the public key algorithm is fully described by the "algorithm"
      field of the "SubjectPublicKeyInfo" structure, and by the
      "subjectPublicKeyAlgorithm" element, respectively.

   An example of the Joining Request and corresponding Response for a
   CoAP Publisher using CoAP and CBOR is specified in Figure 6 and
   Figure 7, where SIG is a signature computed using the private key
   associated to the public key and the algorithm in 'client_cred'.

   The flow graph is presented below for CoAP.  The message flow is
   similar for MQTT, where PUT corresponds to a PUBLISH message, and GET
   corresponds to a SUBSCRIBE message.  Whenever a Client publishes a
   new message, the Broker sends this message to all valid subscribers.

5.1.  Using COSE Objects To Protect The Resource Representation

   The Publisher uses the symmetric COSE Key received from the KDC
   (Section 4) to protect the payload of the PUBLISH operation
   (Section 4.3 of [I-D.ietf-core-coap-pubsub] and
   [MQTT-OASIS-Standard-v5]).  Specifically, the COSE Key is used to
   create a COSE_Encrypt0 object with algorithm specified by KDC.  The
   Publisher uses the private key corresponding to the public key sent
   to the KDC in exchange B (Section 4) to countersign the COSE Object
   as specified in [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs]
   [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct].  The payload is replaced by the
   COSE object before the publication is sent to the Broker.

   The Subscriber uses the 'kid' in the 'countersignature' field in the
   COSE object to retrieve the right public key to verify the
   countersignature.  It then uses the symmetric key received from KDC
   to verify and decrypt the publication received in the payload from
   the Broker (in the case of CoAP the publication is received by the
   CoAP Notification and for MQTT, it is received as a PUBLISH message
   from the Broker to the subscribing client).

   The COSE object is constructed in the following way:

   *  The protected Headers (as described in
      [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs] [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct])
      MUST contain the kid parameter if it was provided in the Joining
      Response, with value the kid of the symmetric COSE Key received in
      Section 4 and MUST contain the content encryption algorithm.

   *  The unprotected Headers MUST contain the Partial IV, with value a
      sequence number that is incremented for every message sent, and
      the counter signature that includes:

      -  the algorithm (same value as in the asymmetric COSE Key
         received in (B)) in the protected header;

      -  the kid (same value as the kid of the asymmetric COSE Key
         received in (B)) in the unprotected header;

      -  the signature computed as specified in
         [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-algs]
         [I-D.ietf-cose-rfc8152bis-struct].

   *  The ciphertext, computed over the plaintext that MUST contain the
      message payload.

   The 'external_aad' is an empty string.

   An example is given in Figure 12:

6.  Profile-specific Considerations

   This section summarises the CoAP and MQTT specific pub-sub
   communications, and considerations respectively.

6.1.  CoAP PubSub Application Profile

   A CoAP Pub-Sub Client and Broker use an ACE transport profile such as
   DTLS [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize], OSCORE
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile].

   As shown in Figure 1, (A) is an Access Token Request and Response
   exchange between Publisher and Authorization Server to retrieve the
   Access Token and RS (Broker) Information.  As specified, the Client
   has the role of a CoAP client, the Broker has the role of the CoAP
   server.

   (B) corresponds to the retrieval of the keying material to protect
   the publication end-to-end (see Section 5.1), and uses
   [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm].  The details are defined in Section 4.

   (C) corresponds to the exchange between the Client and the Broker,
   where the Client sends its access token to the Broker and establishes
   a secure connection with the Broker.  Depending on the Information
   received in (A), this can be for example DTLS handshake, or other
   protocols.  Depending on the application, there may not be the need
   for this set up phase: for example, if OSCORE is used directly.  Note
   that, in line with what defined in the ACE transport profile used,
   the access token includes the scope (i.e. pubsub topics on the
   Broker) the Publisher is allowed to publish to.  For implementation
   simplicity, it is RECOMMENDED that the ACE transport profile used.

   After the previous phases have taken place, the pub-sub communication
   can commence.  The operations of publishing and subscribing are
   defined in [I-D.ietf-core-coap-pubsub].

6.2.  MQTT PubSub Application Profile

   The steps MQTT clients go through are similar to the CoAP clients as
   described in Section 6.1.  The payload that is carried in MQTT
   messages will be protected using COSE.

   In MQTT, topics are organised as a tree, and in the
   [I-D.ietf-ace-mqtt-tls-profile] 'scope' captures permissions for not
   a single topic but a topic filter.  Therefore, topic names (i.e.,
   group names) may include wildcards spanning several levels of the
   topic tree.  Hence, it is important to distinguish application groups
   and security groups defined in [I-D.ietf-core-groupcomm-bis].  An



Palombini & Sengul         Expires 2 July 2022                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft               pubsub-profile                December 2021


   application group has relevance at the application level - for
   example, in MQTT an application group could denote all topics stored
   under ""home/lights/".  On the other hand, a security group is a
   group of endpoints that each store group security material to
   exchange secure communication within the group.  The group
   communication in [I-D.ietf-ace-key-groupcomm] refers to security
   groups.  ToDo: Give a more complete example

   For an MQTT client we envision the following steps to take place:

   1.  Client sends a token request to AS for the requested topics
       (application groups) using the broker as the audience.

   2.  Client sends a token request to AS for the corresponding security
       groups for its application groups using the KDC as the audience.

   3.  Client sends join requests to KDC to gets the keys for these
       security groups.

   4.  Client authorises to the Broker with the token (described in
       [I-D.ietf-ace-mqtt-tls-profile]).

   5.  A Publisher Client sends PUBLISH messages for a given topic and
       protects the payload with the corresponding key for the
       associated security group.  RS validates the PUBLISH message by
       checking the topic stored token.

   6.  A Subscriber Client may send SUBSCRIBE messages with one or
       multiple topic filters.  A topic filter may correspond to
       multiple topics.  RS validates the SUBSCRIBE message by checking
       the stored token for the Client.

7.  Security Considerations

   In the profile described above, the Publisher and Subscriber use
   asymmetric crypto, which would make the message exchange quite heavy
   for small constrained devices.  Moreover, all Subscribers must be
   able to access the public keys of all the Publishers to a specific
   topic to be able to verify the publications.  Such a database could
   be set up and managed by the same entity having control of the key
   material for that topic, i.e. KDC.

   An application where it is not critical that only authorized
   Publishers can publish on a topic may decide not to make use of the
   asymmetric crypto and only use symmetric encryption/MAC to
   confidentiality and integrity protection of the publication.
   However, this is not recommended since, as a result, any authorized
   Subscribers with access to the Broker may forge unauthorized

   publications without being detected.  In this symmetric case the
   Subscribers would only need one symmetric key per topic, and would
   not need to know any information about the Publishers, that can be
   anonymous to it and the Broker.

   Subscribers can be excluded from future publications through re-
   keying for a certain topic.  This could be set up to happen on a
   regular basis, for certain applications.  How this could be done is
   out of scope for this work.

   The Broker is only trusted with verifying that the Publisher is
   authorized to publish, but is not trusted with the publications
   itself, which it cannot read nor modify.  In this setting, caching of
   publications on the Broker is still allowed.
