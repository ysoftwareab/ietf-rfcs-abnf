1.  Introduction

   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a separation between the
   control elements and the forwarding components so that software
   running in a centralized system called a controller, can act to
   program the devices in the network to behave in specific ways.  A
   required element in an SDN architecture is a component that plans how
   the network resources will be used and how the devices will be
   programmed.  It is possible to view this component as performing
   specific computations to place flows within the network given

   knowledge of the availability of network resources, how other
   forwarding devices are programmed, and the way that other flows are
   routed.  The Application-Based Network Operation (ABNO) [RFC7491]
   describes how various components and technologies fit together.

   A domain [RFC4655] is any collection of network elements within a
   common sphere of address management or path computation
   responsibility.  Specifically within this document we mean a part of
   an operator's network that is under common management.  Network
   elements will often be grouped into domains based on technology
   types, vendor profiles, and geographic proximity and under a domain
   controller.

   Multiple such domains in the network are interconnected, and a path
   is established through a series of connected domains to form an end-
   to-end path over which various services are offered.  Each domain is
   under the control of the domain controller (or lower-level
   controller), and a "super controller" (or high-level controller)
   takes responsibility for a high-level view of the network before
   distributing tasks to domain controllers (or lower-level
   controllers).  It is possible for each of the domain to use a
   different tunnelling mechanism (eg RSVP-TE, Segment Routing (SR)
   etc).

   [RFC8453] describes the framework for Abstraction and Control of
   Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) as well as a set of management and
   control functions used to operate multiple TE networks.  This
   documents would apply the ACTN principles to Hierarchy of IP
   controllers (HIC) and focus on the applicability and interactions
   with other protocol and technologies (specific to IP packet domains).

   Sometimes, service (such as Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN),
   Layer 2 Virtual Private Network (L2VPN), Ethernet VPN (EVPN),
   Seamless MPLS) require sites attached to different domains (under the
   control of different domain controller) to be interconnected as part
   of the VPN service.  This require multi-domain coordination between
   domain controllers to compute and set-up E2E path for the VPN
   service.

   This document describes the interactions between various IP
   controllers in a hierarchical fashion to provide various IP services.
   It describes how the Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered
   Networks (ACTN) framework is applied to the Hierarchy of IP
   controllers (HIC) as well as document the interactions with control
   plane protocols (like BGP, Path Computation Element Communication
   Protocol (PCEP)) and management plane aspects (Yang models) to
   provide end to end dynamic services spanning multiple domains and
   controllers (e.g.  L3VPN, Seamless MPLS etc.).

           Figure 1: Example: Hierarchy of IP controllers (HIC)

   The IP "Super Controller" receives request from the network/service
   orchestrator to set-up dynamic services spanning multiple domains.
   The IP "Super Controller" breaks down and assigns tasks to the domain
   controllers, responsible for communicating to network devices in the
   domain.  It further coordinates between the controller to provide a
   unified view of the multi-domain network.

2.1.  Mapping to ACTN

   As per [RFC8453], ACTN has following main functions -

   o  Multi-domain coordination

   o  Virtualization/Abstraction




Li, et al.              Expires September 6, 2019               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                     HIC                        March 2019


   o  Customer mapping/translation

   o  Virtual service coordination

   These functions are part of Multi Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC)
   and/or Provisioning Network Controller (PNC).  Further these
   functions are part of the controller / orchestrator.

   The HIC is an instantiation of ACTN framework for IP packet network.
   The IP domain (lower-level) controllers implements the PNC
   functionalities for configuring, controlling and monitoring the IP
   domain.  The "super controller" (high-level controller) implements
   the MDSC functionalities for coordination between multiple domains as
   well as maintaining an abstracted view of multiple domains.  It also
   takes care of the service related functionalities of customer
   mapping/translation and virtual service coordination.

   The ACTN functions are part of the IP controllers and responsible for
   the TE topology and E2E path computation/set-up.  There are other
   functions along with ACTN that are needed to manage multiple IP
   domain networks.

2.2.  Interface between Super Controller and Domain Controller in HIC

   The interaction between super controller and domain controller in HIC
   is a combination of Control Plane and Management Plane interface as
   shown in Figure 2.  BGP [RFC4271] and PCEP [RFC5440] are example of
   the control plane interface; where as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF
   [RFC8040] are example of management plane interface.

       # -> Management Plane Interface



    Figure 2: Interface between Super Controller and Domain Controller

   Note that ACTN's MDSC-PNC Interface (MPI) could be implemented via
   management plane interface using Yang models
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-yang] or via PCEP control plane interface
   [I-D.ietf-pce-applicability-actn].

3.  Key Concepts

3.1.  Topology

   The Domain Controller is expected to be aware of the topology of the
   network devices in its domain.  The domain controller could
   participate in the IGP ([RFC3630] and [RFC5305]) or use BGP-LS
   [RFC7752] by which link-state and TE information is collected and
   shared with domain controller using the BGP routing protocol.

   An alternate approach would be to rely on the management plane
   interface which uses the YANG model for network/TE Topology as per
   [RFC8345] and [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo].

   The domain controller is expected to share the domain topology to the
   Super Controller as aligned to ACTN (where PNC abstract the topology
   towards MDSC).  A level of abstraction is usually applied while



Li, et al.              Expires September 6, 2019               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                     HIC                        March 2019


   presenting the topology to a higher level controller.  Topology
   abstraction is described in [RFC7926] as well as [RFC8453].  BGP-LS,
   PCEP-LS [I-D.dhodylee-pce-pcep-ls] or management plane interface
   based on the abstracted network/TE Topology could be used to carry
   the abstract topology to the super-controller.  At minimum the border
   nodes and inter-domain links are exposed to the super-controller.

   Further [RFC8453] defines three types of topology abstraction - (1)
   Native/White Topology; (2) Black Topology; and (3) Grey Topology.
   Based on the local policy, the domain controller would share the
   domain topology to the Super Controller based on the abstraction
   type.  Note that any of the control plane or management plane
   mechanism could be used to carry abstracted domain topology.  The
   Super Controller's MDSC function is expected to manage a E2E topology
   by coordinating the abstracted domain topology received from the
   domain controllers.

3.2.  Path Computation/Path instantiation

   The Domain Controller is responsible for computing and setup of path
   when the source and destination is in the same domain, otherwise the
   Super Controller coordinates the multi-domain path computation and
   setup with the help of the domain controller.  This is aligned to
   ACTN.

   PCEP [RFC5440] provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements
   (PCEs) [RFC4655] to perform path computations in response to Path
   Computation Clients (PCCs) requests.  Since then, the role and
   function of the PCE has grown to allow delegated control [RFC8231]
   and PCE-initiated use of network resources [RFC8281].

   Further, [RFC6805] and [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-hpce] describes a
   hierarchy of PCE with Parent PCE coordinating multi-domain path
   computation function between Child PCE(s).  This fits well with HIC
   as described in this document.

   Note that a management plane interface which uses the YANG model for
   path computation/setup ([I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation] and
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te]) could be used in place of PCEP.

   In case there is a need to stitch per domain tunnels into an E2E
   tunnel, mechanism are described in
   [I-D.dugeon-pce-stateful-interdomain].

3.3.  BGP considerations

   [RFC4456] describes the concept of route-reflection where a "route
   reflector" (RR) reflects the routes to avoid full mesh connection
   between Internal BGP (IBGP) peers.  The IP domain controller can play
   the role of RR in its domain.  The super controller can further act
   as RR to towards the domain controller.

   BGP can provide routing policies for the traffic management, like
   route preference, AS-path filter policy, IP-prefix filter policy and
   route aggregation.  The controller can distribute these BGP Policy
   into the routers in a single IP domain.  For the scenario of multiple
   domains, the super controller can distribute per BGP Policy into each
   IP domain controller.  Then the IP domain controller trickles down
   the BGP Policy to the network devices.

   [RFC5575] describes the concept of BGP Flowspec that can be used to
   distribute traffic flow specifications.  A flow specification is an
   n-tuple consisting of several matching criteria that can be applied
   to IP traffic.  The controller can originate the flow specifications
   and disseminate to the routers.  The flow action includes the
   redirection to a specific TE tunnel.  Also, the IP domain controller
   could be responsible for collecting the flow sample in its domain and
   the super controller can act as the Flow Analysis Server.

   [RFC7854] describes the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) to monitor BGP
   sessions.  BMP is used to obtain the route views with a flexible way.
   In the fashion of hierarchical architecture, the IP domain controller
   can be used as the domain Monitoring Station.  Meanwhile, the super
   controller is responsible for a high-level view of the global network
   state.

4.  VPN Service

4.1.  Seamless MPLS

   Seamless MPLS [I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls] describes an architecture
   which can be used to extend MPLS networks to integrate access and
   core/aggregation networks into a single MPLS domain.In the seamless
   MPLS for mobile backhaul, since there are multiple domains including
   the core network and multiple mobile backhaul networks, for each
   domain there is a domain controller.  In order to implement the end-
   to-end network service provision, there should be coordination among
   multiple domain controllers.

                          Figure 3: Seamless MPLS

   Super Controller is responsible for setting the seamless MPLS
   service.  It should break down the service model to network
   configuration model [RFC8309] and the domain controller further break
   it to the device configuration model to the PE/ASBR to make the E2E
   seamless MPLS service.  The selection of appropriate ASBRs and
   handling of intra-domain tunnels is coordinated by the Super
   Controller in the similar fashion as shown in Section 4.2.

   By enabling BGP sessions between Domain Controller and Super
   Controller, BGP labeled routes can also be learned at Super

   Controller.  As Super Controller is aware of the (abstract) topology,
   it could make intelligent decisions regarding E2E BGP LSP to optimize
   based on the overall traffic information.

4.2.  L3VPN

   A Layer 3 IP VPN service is a collection of sites that are authorized
   to exchange traffic between each other over a shared IP
   infrastructure.  [RFC4110] provides a framework for Layer 3 Provider-
   Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs).  [RFC8299] provides a
   L3VPN service delivery YANG model for PE-based VPNs.  The Super
   controller is expected to implement the L3SM model and translate it
   to network models towards the domain controller, which in turn
   translate it to the device model.  See [RFC8309] for more details.

   to be trickle down to the network device to setup the L3VPN.

   Based on the QoS or Policy requirement for the L3VPN service, the
   Super Controller may -

   o  Set the tunnel selection policy at the PE/ASBR routers so that
      they could select the existing tunnels

   o  Select an existing tunnels at the controller level and bind it to
      the VPN service

   o  Initiate the process of creating a new tunnel based on the QoS
      requirement and bind it the VPN service

   o  Initiate the process of creating a new tunnel based on the the
      policy

   Refer [I-D.lee-teas-te-service-mapping-yang] for more details from
   ACTN perspective.

   Apart from the Management plane interface based on respective YANG
   models, the control plane interface PCEP could be used for path
   computation and setup.

4.3.  L2VPN and EVPN service

   There are two fundamentally different kinds of Layer 2 VPN service
   that a service provider could offer to a customer: Virtual Private
   Wire Service (VPWS) and Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) [RFC4664].
   A VPWS is a VPN service that supplies an L2 point-to-point service.
   A VPLS is an L2 service that emulates LAN service across a Wide Area
   Network (WAN).  A BGP MPLS-based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) [RFC7432]
   addresses some of the limitations when it comes to multihoming and
   redundancy, multicast optimization, provisioning simplicity, flow-
   based load balancing, and multipathing etc.

   The handling of L2VPN/EVPN service is done in a similar fashion as
   shown in Section 4.2.

5.  Possible Features/Extensions

   This sections list some of the possible features or protocol
   extensions that could be worked on to deploy HIC in a multi-domain
   packet network.

   1.  Simplify the initial configurations needed to set-up the
       relationship between the super controller and the domain
       controllers.  Note that this could be done via exchanges during
       initial session establishment, discovery via other protocols,
       service discovery (such as DNS etc.).

   2.  The (higher-level controller, lower-level controller)
       relationship or the the role of the controller.

   3.  The learning and handling of various capabilities of the Super
       Controller and Domain Controller.

       high availability.

6.  Other Considerations

6.1.  Control Plane

6.1.1.  PCE / PCEP

   The Path Computation Element communication Protocol (PCEP) [RFC5440]
   provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) [RFC4655] to
   perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients
   (PCCs) requests.

   The ability to compute shortest constrained TE LSPs in Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across
   multiple domains has been identified as a key motivation for PCE
   development.

   A stateful PCE [RFC8231] is capable of considering, for the purposes
   of path computation, not only the network state in terms of links and
   nodes (referred to as the Traffic Engineering Database or TED) but
   also the status of active services (previously computed paths, and
   currently reserved resources, stored in the Label Switched Paths
   Database (LSPDB).

   [RFC8051] describes general considerations for a stateful PCE
   deployment and examines its applicability and benefits, as well as
   its challenges and limitations through a number of use cases.

   [RFC8231] describes a set of extensions to PCEP to provide stateful
   control.  A stateful PCE has access to not only the information
   carried by the network's Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP), but also
   the set of active paths and their reserved resources for its
   computations.  The additional state allows the PCE to compute
   constrained paths while considering individual LSPs and their
   interactions.  [RFC8281] describes the setup, maintenance and
   teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the stateful PCE model.

   [RFC8231] also describes the active stateful PCE.  The active PCE
   functionality allows a PCE to reroute an existing LSP or make changes
   to the attributes of an existing LSP, or a PCC to delegate control of
   specific LSPs to a new PCE.

Internet-Draft                     HIC                        March 2019


   Computing paths across large multi-domain environments require
   special computational components and cooperation between entities in
   different domains capable of complex path computation.  The PCE
   provides an architecture and a set of functional components to
   address this problem space.  A PCE may be used to compute end-to-end
   paths across multi-domain environments using a per-domain path
   computation technique [RFC5152].  The Backward recursive PCE based
   path computation (BRPC) mechanism [RFC5441] defines a PCE-based path
   computation procedure to compute inter-domain constrained MPLS and
   GMPLS TE networks.  However, both per-domain and BRPC techniques
   assume that the sequence of domains to be crossed from source to
   destination is known, either fixed by the network operator or
   obtained by other means.

   [RFC6805] describes a Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) architecture which can
   be used for computing end-to-end paths for inter-domain MPLS Traffic
   Engineering (TE) and GMPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) when the
   domain sequence is not known.  Within the Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE)
   architecture, the Parent PCE (P-PCE) is used to compute a multi-
   domain path based on the domain connectivity information.  A Child
   PCE (C-PCE) may be responsible for a single domain or multiple
   domains, it is used to compute the intra-domain path based on its
   domain topology information.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-hpce] state the considerations for stateful
   PCE(s) in hierarchical PCE architecture.  In particular, the
   behaviour changes and additions to the existing stateful PCE
   mechanisms (including PCE- initiated LSP set-up and active PCE usage)
   in the context of networks using the H-PCE architecture.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-applicability-actn] examines the applicability of PCE/
   PCEP to the ACTN framework in detail.

6.1.2.  BGP

   [RFC7752] describes a mechanism by which link-state and TE
   information can be collected from networks and shared with external
   components using the BGP routing protocol.  This is achieved using a
   new BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) encoding format
   and a new BGP path attribute (BGP-LS attribute) that carries link,
   node, and prefix parameters and attributes.

   BGP-LS is a new approach to collect the network topology information.
   It is an extension to BGP for distribution the network's link-state
   (LS) topology to external entities, such as the SDN controller.
   Network's link-state topology consists of nodes and links and a set
   of attributes.  The link-state topology is distributed among the IGP
   domain.  The specific protocol used in an IGP domain could be OSPF



Li, et al.              Expires September 6, 2019              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                     HIC                        March 2019


   [RFC2238] or IS-IS [ISO10589].  Note that, the detailed link-state
   models of these two protocols are not identical.  Therefore, BGP-LS
   can provide a more abstract topology model which can map the IGP
   models.

   The domain controller acts as a consumer to collect the domain's
   link-state and TE information via BGP-LS.  The domain controller
   would usually abstract the domain information towards the super-
   controller and further send it via BGP-LS.

   BGP-Flowspec is a solution devised for preventing distributed Denial-
   of-service (DDoS) attack.  BGP-Flowspec distributes specification
   rules into neighbours.  [RFC5575] defines a new BGP NLRI encoding
   format that can be used to distribute traffic flow specifications.
   Additionally, it defines two applications of that encoding format:
   one that can be used to automate inter-domain coordination of traffic
   filtering, such as what is required in order to mitigate DDoS
   attacks; and a second application to provide traffic filtering in the
   context of BGP/MPLS VPN service.

   The IP domain controller can act as the traffic sampling node.  The
   super controller can act as the traffic analysis server.  When the
   super controller finds the attack happened, the super controller
   should distribute the flow rules to associated IP domain controllers.
   And each IP domain controller should distribute the flow rules into
   the ingress routers.  Additionally one of the actions taken could be
   "redirect" where flow could be redirected to the TE tunnels created
   by the controller.

   [I-D.luo-grow-bgp-controller-based-ts] describes the traffic steering
   based on BGP controller.  The traditional method for traffic steering
   depends on static configuration which is time consuming and
   inefficient.  With the hierarchical IP controller, the IP domain
   controller can have the domain network topology view and routing
   information while the super controller can have the global network
   topology view and routing information.  The super controller can
   compute the end-to-end paths to satisfy the differentiated service
   requirement.  The IP domain controller may be used to distribute the
   routing policy into the routers.  BGP policy varies in many aspects.
   Its goal is to meet the customer application and connectivity
   requirement, and specific service transport needs.  So the super BGP
   controller is responsible for the coordination of multiple domain BGP
   Policy.  And then distribute Policy to related IP domain controller.
   The IP domain controller is responsible for distributing the policy
   to its network nodes.

   constrain mechanism in the hierarchical route reflection (RR)

   scenario.  [RFC4684] describes the route target constrain mechanism
   to build a route distribution graph in order to restrict the
   propagation of Virtual Private Network (VPN) routes.
   [I-D.ietf-idr-rtc-hierarchical-rr] proposes a solution to address the
   RT constrain issue in the hierarchical RR scenarios.  The super
   controller corresponding to higher level RR can receive the RT-
   constrain routes from the lower level RR, which is acted by the IP
   domain controller.  The higher level RR will select one of the
   received routes as the best route.  then it should advertise the best
   route to all the lower level RR to build the route distribution
   graph.  This fits well with the HIC as described in this document.

6.2.  Management Plane

6.2.1.  YANG Models

   This is an non-exhaustive list of possible yang models developed or
   in-development that could be used for HIC.

      Topology: [RFC8345] defines a generic YANG data model for network
      topology.  [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te-topo] defines a YANG data model
      for representing, retrieving and manipulating Traffic Engineering
      (TE) Topologies.

      Tunnel: [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] defines a YANG data model for the
      configuration and management of Traffic Engineering (TE)
      interfaces, tunnels and Label Switched Paths (LSPs).

      L3VPN: The Layer 3 service model (L3SM) is defined in [RFC8299],
      which is a YANG data model that can be used for communication
      between customers and network operators and to deliver a Layer 3
      provider-provisioned VPN service.  [I-D.ietf-bess-l3vpn-yang]
      defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure and manage
      BGP Layer 3 VPNs at the device.  Note that a network configuration
      model at the Domain Controller level needs to be developed.

      L2VPN/EVPN: [RFC8466] defines a YANG data model that can be used
      to configure a Layer 2 Provider Provisioned VPN service.  This
      model is intended to be instantiated at management system to
      deliver the overall service.  [I-D.ietf-bess-l2vpn-yang] and
      [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-yang] defines a YANG data model to configure
      and manage L2VPN and EVPN service respectively.  Note that a
      network configuration model at the Domain Controller level needs
      to be developed.

      OAM: TBD

Internet-Draft                     HIC                        March 2019


      BGP Policy: [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model] defines a YANG data model
      that can be used to configure BGP Policy based on data centre,
      carrier and content provider operational requirements.  The model
      is intended to be vendor-neutral, in order to allow operators to
      manage BGP configuration in heterogeneous environments with
      routers supplied by multiple vendors.  Note that a network
      configuration model at the Domain Controller level needs to be
      developed.

      BGP Flowspec: [I-D.wu-idr-flowspec-yang-cfg] defines a YANG data
      model for Flow Specification implementations.  The configuration
      data is described as flow specification rules that can be
      distributed as BGP NLRI to a network element.  The rules can be
      used to filter Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS)
      besides other use cases.  Note that a network configuration model
      at the Domain Controller level needs to be developed.

   [Editor's Note - the above list should be extended.]

6.2.2.  Protocol Considerations

   The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241] provides
   mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of
   network devices.  The RESTCONF [RFC8040] describes an HTTP-based
   protocol that provides a programmatic interface for accessing data
   defined in YANG, using the data-store concepts defined in NETCONF.

   Some other mechanism like gRPC/gNMI could also be used between
   controllers using the same YANG data models.

   There are no new security concerns in this document.
