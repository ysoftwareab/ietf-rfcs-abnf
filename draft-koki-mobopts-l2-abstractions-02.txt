1.  Introduction

   In recent years, the environment around computers is not static and
   changes dynamically.  Especially, when a mobile node moves to a
   different network, its environment considerably changes.  For
   example, in the case of wireless communication, parameters such as
   radio strength changes widely depends on time or site.

   For efficient network communication, it is vital for a protocol layer
   to know or utilize other layer's information.  There are several
   proposals for seamless handovers in IPv6 network such as Fast
   Handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) [1] and Hierarchical Mobile IPv6
   (HMIPv6) [2].  In FMIPv6, the network layer must know the indication
   of a handover from the link layer in advance to achieve seamless
   handovers.  However, each protocol layer is designed independently
   and information exchange between protocol layers is not allowed.

   For further handover enhancements, this document defines nine kinds
   of L2 triggers in the form of "Primitive".  This concept can be
   applied to L3-driven fast handover mechanism using "Primitives".

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms.

   L3-Driven Fast Handover

      The handover which is initiated by the network layer on a mobile
      node.  Since it allows L3 handover preparation during
      communication, it can reduce packet loss during handover.
      L3-driven fast handover mechanism requires L2 information as a
      trigger of handover procedure.

   Peer

      The attachment point of a mobile node.  (e.g., An access point in
      IEEE 802.11 networks.)

   Primitive

      A unit of information which is sent from one layer to another.
      There are four classes of primitives: Request, Confirm, Indication
      and Response.

3.  Primitives for L2 Abstractions

   Each layer offers its services by the form of primitives.  There are
   four classes of primitives as shown in Figure 1: Request, Confirm,
   Indication, and Response.  The request is issued by the layer that
   wants to get services or information from another layer, and the
   confirm is the acknowledgment of the request.  The indication is a
   notification of information to the layer that requested the service,
   and the response is the acknowledgment of the indication.  In this
   architecture, each layer can communicate evenly.

            ------------------------------------------------------
                      Request                    Response
                        ||      /\          /\      ||
            Layer N     ||      ||          ||      ||
            ------------||------||----------||------||------------
                        ||      ||          ||      ||
                        \/      ||          ||      \/
            Layer N-m        Confirm    Indication
            ------------------------------------------------------

                          Figure 1: Primitives

   The primitive consists of five fields: the protocol layer id to which
   this primitive should be sent, the protocol id to which protocol
   entity this primitive should be sent, the primitive class (i.e.,
   request, confirm, indication, or response), the primitive name, and
   parameters.

   There are three different usages of "Primitives":

   Type 1.  To provide L2 information to upper layers immediately

           A "Request" primitive is an acquisition request for L2
           informaiton.  As a "Confirm" primitive, L2 information
           returns immediately.

   Type 2.  To notify upper layers of L2 events asynchronously

           "Request" and "Confirm" primitives are used just for
           registration.  When an event occurs, an "Indication"
           primitive is asynchronously delivered to an upper layer.

   Type 3.  To control L2 actions from upper layers

           A "Request" primitive is a request for operation.  Ack or
           nack returns immediately as a "Confirm" primitive.

4.  Definitions of Primitives

   In order to obtain and change L2 information, some sorts of
   Primitives described below are necessary.  The following Primitives
   are defined.

4.1  L2-LinkStatus (Type 1)

   The L2-LinkStatus.request is sent to the link layer when an upper
   layer needs the current information of a link.  The
   L2-LinkStatus.request primitive contains "Network Interface ID"
   parameter.  In response, the L2-LinkStatus.confirm returns.  The
   L2-LinkStatus.confirm primitive contains three parameters: "Network
   Interface ID", "Peer" and "Condition".  "Peer" and "Condition"
   indicate the current status about the link between a mobile node and
   a peer.

4.2  L2-PeerList (Type 1)

   The L2-PeerList.request is sent to the link layer when an upper layer
   needs a list of candidate peers.  The L2-PeerList.request primitive
   contains "Network Interface ID" parameter.  In response, the
   L2-PeerList.confirm returns with "Network Interface ID" parameter and
   "Peer List" parameter.  "Peer List" parameter is the list of
   candidate peers.

4.3  L2-PeerFound (Type 2)

   The L2-PeerFound.indication is asynchronously provided to an upper
   layer when new peers are detected.  This primitive carries "Network
   Interface ID" parameter and "Peer List" parameter.  "Peer List"
   parameter contains the information of new peers detected by a mobile
   node.  In order to use this notification, the registration process
   using L2-PeerFound.request and L2-PeerFound.confirm is needed in
   advance.  The L2-PeerFound.request primitive has two parameters:
   "Network Interface ID" and "Enable/Disable".  "Enable/Disable"
   parameter shows whether this notification function is turned on.
   When this registration succeeds, the L2-PeerFound.confirm returns
   with "Network Interface ID" parameter and "Ack" parameter in
   response.

4.4  L2-PeerLost (Type 2)

   The L2-PeerLost.indication is asynchronously provided to an upper
   layer when a peer included in the list of candidate peers is got
   lost.  This primitive carries "Network Interface ID" parameter and
   "Peer List" parameter.  "Peer List" parameter contains the
   information of the peers which disappeared from the candidates list.

Internet-Draft              L2 Abstractions                February 2005


   The registration process using the L2-PeerLost.request and the
   L2-PeerLost.confirm is similar to the L2-PeerFound above.

4.5  L2-LinkUp (Type 2)

   The L2-LinkUp.indication is asynchronously provided to an upper layer
   when a new link is connected.  This primitive carries "Network
   Interface ID" parameter and "Peer" parameter.  The L2-LinkUp.request
   contains "Network Interface ID" parameter and "Enable/Disable"
   parameter for registration.  When the registration succeeds, the
   L2-LinkUp.confirm with "Network Interface ID" parameter and "Ack"
   parameter returns.

4.6  L2-LinkDown (Type 2)

   The L2-LinkDown.indication is asynchronously provided to an upper
   layer when an existing link is disconnected.  The registration
   processing is same as the L2-LinkUp above.

4.7  L2-LinkToBeDown (Type 2)

   The L2-LinkToBeDown.indication is asynchronously provided to an upper
   layer when an existing link is to be disconnected.  This notification
   contains two parameters: "Network Interface ID" and "Peer".  "Peer"
   parameter is the attachment point at which the link quality is
   degrading.  In the registration processing, the
   L2-LinkToBeDown.request carries "Network Interface ID" parameter and
   "Enable/Disable" parameter.

4.8  L2-LinkConnect (Type 3)

   The L2-LinkConnect.request is sent to the link layer when an upper
   layer has to change or create a new link to the specific "Peer".
   This primitive carries "Network Interface ID" parameter and "Peer"
   parameter.  This operation begins after sending
   L2-LinkConnect.confirm with "Ack" by the link layer.

4.9  L2-LinkDisconnect (Type 3)

   The L2-LinkDisconnect.request is sent to the link layer when an upper
   layer has to destroy an existing link to the specific "Peer".  This
   primitive carries "Network Interface ID" parameter and "Peer"
   parameter.  This operation begins after sending
   L2-LinkConnect.confirm with "Ack" by the link layer.

5.  Definitions of Static Parameters

   This section lists static parameters.  Once the values of static
   parameters are configured, they do not change frequently during
   communication.  The following parameters are transferred as a part of
   primitives.

5.1  Network Interface ID

   "Network interface ID" parameter identifies uniquely the network
   interface in a node.  The identifier is an implementation-specific
   consideration (e.g., name, index or unique address assigned to each
   interface).  This parameter also contains the network interface type
   which indicates the kind of technology of the network interface
   (e.g., IEEE802.11a/b/g, 3GPP, etc.).  This parameter is required for
   all the primitives.

6.  Definitions of Dynamic Parameters

   This section lists dynamic parameters.  The values of dynamic
   parameters change frequently during communication.  The following
   parameters are transferred as a part of primitives.

6.1  Peer

   "Peer" parameter uniquely identifies the peer.

6.2  Condition

   "Condition" parameter consists of the following sub-parameters:
   available bandwidth and link quality level.  These sub-parameters are
   the abstracted information for considering current quality-of
   service.  The abstraction algorithms of sub-parameters depend on
   hardware device and software implementation.  The useful range of
   link quality level is from one to five; VERY GOOD, GOOD, FAIR, BAD,
   VERY BAD.  Each GOOD and BAD level is calcurated as a high or low
   watermark.

6.3  Peer List

   "Peer List" parameter consists of arbitrary couples of two
   sub-parameters: "Peer" and "Condition".  This parameter shows a list
   of peers and its condition.

6.4  Enable/Disable

   "Enable/Disable" flag is used for turning event notification on/off.
   When an upper layer needs notifications, the "Request" primitive with
   "Enable" is sent to the link layer as registration.  When an upper
   layer needs no more notifications, the "Request" primitive with
   "Disable" is sent.

6.5  Ack/Error

   When an upper layer requests some notifications, the link layer
   receives and confirms this "Request".  If the "Request" is valid, the
   "Confirm" primitive with "Ack" is sent.  And if it is invalid, the
   "Confirm" with "Error" is sent to the upper layer.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features to manage the L2 information.

   In the beginning of the L3-driven handover procedure, L2 detects
   radio signal strength is going down.  Then L2 sends
   L2-LinkToBeDown.indication to L3.  L3 prepares for handover (e.g.,
   CoA generation, DAD, ND cache creation, and routing table setting)
   and sends L2-PeerList.request to L2 if the list of access points is
   needed.

   If L3 decides to perform handover according to some rules, L3 sends
   L2-LinkConnect.request with some parameters about candidate access
   points to request L2 handover.  L2 handover begins after sending
   L2-LinkConnect.confirm to L3.  When L2 handover finished, L2 sends
   L2-LinkUp.indication to notify L3.  At last, L3 performs handover
   (e.g., sending BU).

   One of the important features of L3-driven fast handover using
   Primitives is that the L3 handover preparation can be done during

   When the MN establishes link connectivity with the PAR, it performs
   router discovery.  Then, the MN can send RtSolPr message to the PAR
   in order to resolve access point identifiers to subnet router
   information.  To send RtSolPr, a MN discovers one or more access
   points by sending L2-PeerList.request to the link layer.  As a
   response to L2-PeerList.request, L2-PeerList.confirm returns with
   "Peer List" parameter which contains identifiers and conditions of
   nearby access points.  After initial AP discovery,
   L2-PeerFound.indication with "Peer List" is also sent from the link
   layer when one or more access points are discovered.

   When the link layer of the MN detects radio signal strength is going
   down, it sends L2-LinkToBeDown.indication to the network layer.
   Then, the MN sends FBU to PAR as the beginning of L3 handover
   procedure.  The NCoA required for FBU message is determined according
   to the MN's policy database and received PrRtAdv message.  As a
   response to FBU, the MN receives FBack and then switches its link by
   L2-LinkConnect.request with specific "Peer" parameter immediately.
   The handover policy of the MN is outside the scope of this document.

   After L2 handover, the link layer of the MN sends
   L2-LinkUp.indication to the network layer.  The MN sends FNA message
   to NAR immediately.  The NAR will send tunneled and buffered packets
   to the MN.

Appendix C.  Example Mapping of Primitives and IEEE802.11

   This section shows examples of the mapping between "Primitives" and
   IEEE802.11 parameters.

C.1  L2-LinkStatus

   Most of parameters for L2-LinkStatus are related to the configuration
   of network interface hardware.  So, the operating system and the
   device driver module can easily collect such information.  However,
   to create the "Condition" parameter, the MN should maintain
   statistics and parameters related to current wireless environment.

   There are two sub-parameters of the "Condition" parameter: available
   bandwidth, link quality level.  An available bandwidth of the current
   peer can be obtained by maintaining transmission rate indication and
   statistics of frame transmission at every time the frame transmission
   occurs.  A link quality level can be updated by maintaining the
   following parameters and statistics at every time the frame reception
   occurs: receive signal strength indication (RSSI), transmission/
   reception rate indication, transmit/receive latency, bit error rate,
   frame error rate and noise level.  Some parameters can be managed by
   setting threshold from software.  When the parameters cross the
   threshold, an interrupt is generated for the software.

C.2  L2-PeerList

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-PeerList returns all detected APs as peer
   candidates (by "Peer List" parameter).  Therefore, the MN should
   always maintain the database of available access points according to
   reception of beacon frame, probe response frame and all frames.  This
   AP database is managed in consideration of time, number of frames and
   signal strength.  There are some network interface hardwares that can
   notify events to operating system only when the desired event occurs,
   by setting threshold from software.  Moreover, the MN can transmit
   probe request frame for access point discovery, if needed.

C.3  L2-PeerFound

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-PeerFound is notified when new peers are
   detected by listening beacons or scanning APs.  If the received frame
   (mainly beacon or probe response) is not in the AP database described
   in Appendix C.2, then the link layer can create
   L2-PeerFound.indication.

C.4  L2-PeerLost

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-PeerLost is notified when an AP included

Internet-Draft              L2 Abstractions                February 2005


   in the list of candidate APs is got lost by listening beacons or
   scanning APs.  If the entry in the AP database described in Appendix
   C.2 expires, or signal strength of the received frame (mainly beacon
   or probe response) is under threshold, then the link layer can create
   L2-PeerLost.indication.

C.5  L2-LinkUp

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-LinkUp is notified when association or
   reassociation event occurs.  When such event occurs, the MN receives
   association response frame or reassociation response frame.
   Immediately after receiving it, the link layer can create
   L2-LinkUp.indication.

C.6  L2-LinkDown

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-LinkDown is notified when disassociation
   event occurs.  When such event occurs, the MN sends disassociation
   frame to AP, or the entry of the specific AP is deleted from the AP
   database described in Appendix C.2.  By detecting such events, the
   link layer can create L2-LinkDown.indication.

C.7  L2-LinkToBeDown

   In IEEE 802.11 networks, L2-LinkToBeDown is notified when radio
   signal strength of the connected AP is going down.  By maintaining
   parameters for a link quality level like the description in Appendix
   C.1, the link layer can create L2-LinkToBeDown.indication.

C.8  L2-LinkConnect

   In IEEE802.11 networks, each AP is identified by BSSID, the service
   set of several APs is identified by SSID.  When L2-LinkConnect is
   used to connect specific AP or service set, the link layer should set
   BSSID or SSID.  Also, the channel should be set appropriately at the
   same time by searching database described in Appendix C.2.

C.9  L2-LinkDisconnect

   In IEEE802.11 networks, the MN sends disassociation message to the AP
   for disconnection.  When L2-LinkDisconnect is used for disconnection
   from the current AP, the link layer should send disassociation
   message to the appropriate AP, and stop data transmission.
