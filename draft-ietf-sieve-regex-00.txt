Abstract

   In some cases, it is desirable to have a string matching mechanism
   which is more powerful than a simple exact match, a substring match
   or a glob-style wildcard match.  The regular expression matching
   mechanism defined in this draft should allow users to isolate just
   about any string or address in a message header or envelope.

Open Issues (to be removed prior to publication as an RFC)

   o  The major open issue with this draft is what to do, if anything,

      collating sequences and character equivalents sufficient?  Should
      we reference the unicode technical specification?  Should we punt
      and publish the document as experimental?

   o  Should we allow shorthands such as \\b (word boundary) and \\w
      (word character)?

   o  Should we allow backreferences (useful for matching double words,
      etc.)?

Internet-Draft          Sieve -- Regex Extension           February 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document describes an extension to the Sieve language defined by
   [I-D.ietf-sieve-3028bis] for comparing strings to regular
   expressions.

   Conventions for notations are as in [I-D.ietf-sieve-3028bis] section
   1.1, including use of [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft          Sieve -- Regex Extension           February 2006


2.  Capability Identifier

   The capability string associated with the extension defined in this
   document is "regex".

Internet-Draft          Sieve -- Regex Extension           February 2006


3.  Regex Match Type

   Commands that support matching may take the optional tagged argument
   ":regex" to specify that a regular expression match should be
   performed.  The ":regex" match type is subject to the same rules and
   restrictions as the standard match types defined in [I-D.ietf-sieve-
   3028bis].

   For convenience, the "MATCH-TYPE" syntax element defined in
   [I-D.ietf-sieve-3028bis] is augmented here as follows:

   MATCH-TYPE  =/  ":regex"

   Example:

   require "regex";

   # Try to catch unsolicited email.
   if anyof (
     # if a message is not to me (with optional +detail),
     not address :regex ["to", "cc", "bcc"]
       "me(\\\\+.*)?@company\\\\.com",

     # or the subject is all uppercase (no lowercase)
     header :regex :comparator "i;octet" "subject"
       "^[^[:lower:]]+$" ) {

     discard;      # junk it
   }

   The ":regex" match type is compatible with both the "i;octet" and
   "i;ascii-casemap" comparators and may be used with them.

   Implementations MUST support extended regular expressions (EREs) as
   defined by [IEEE.1003-2.1992].  Any regular expression not defined by
   [IEEE.1003-2.1992], as well as [IEEE.1003-2.1992] basic regular
   expressions, word boundaries and backreferences are not supported by
   this extension.  Implementations SHOULD reject regular expressions
   that are unsupported by this specification as a syntax error.

   The following tables provide a brief summary of the regular
   expressions that MUST be supported.  This table is presented here
   only as a guideline.  [IEEE.1003-2.1992] should be used as the
   definitive reference.

4.  Interaction with Sieve Variables

   This extension is compatible with, and may be used in conjunction
   with the Sieve Variables extension [I-D.ietf-sieve-variables].

4.1.  Match variables

   A sieve interpreter which supports both "regex" and "variables", MUST
   set "match variables" (as defined by [I-D.ietf-sieve-variables]
   section 3.2) whenever the ":regex" match type is used.  The list of
   match variables will contain the strings corresponding to the group
   operators in the regular expression.  The groups are ordered by the
   position of the opening parenthesis, from left to right.  Note that
   in regular expressions, expansions match as much as possible (greedy
   matching).

   Example:

   require ["fileinto", "regex", "variables"];

   if header :regex "List-ID" "<(.*)@" {
       fileinto "lists.${1}"; stop;
   }

   # Imagine the header
   # Subject: [acme-users] [fwd] version 1.0 is out
   if header :regex "Subject" "^[(.*)] (.*)$" {
       # ${1} will hold "acme-users] [fwd"
       stop;
   }

4.2.  Set modifier :quoteregex

   A sieve interpreter which supports both "regex" and "variables", MUST
   support the optional tagged argument ":quoteregex" for use with the
   "set" action.  The ":quoteregex" modifier is subject to the same
   rules and restrictions as the standard modifiers defined in
   [I-D.ietf-sieve-variables] section 4.

   For convenience, the "MODIFIER" syntax element defined in [I-D.ietf-
   sieve-variables] is augmented here as follows:

   MODIFIER  =/  ":quoteregex"

   This modifier adds the necessary quoting to ensure that the expanded
   text will only match a literal occurrence if used as a parameter to
   :regex.  Every character with special meaning (".", "*", "?", etc.)
   is prefixed with "\" in the expansion.  This modifier has a

   precedence value of 20 when used with other modifiers.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are discussed in [I-D.ietf-sieve-3028bis].
   It is believed that this extension does not introduce any additional
   security concerns.

   However, a poor implementation COULD introduce security problems
   ranging from degradation of performance to denial of service.  If an
   implementation uses a third-party regular expression library, that
   library should be checked for potentially problematic regular
   expressions, such as "(.*)*".
