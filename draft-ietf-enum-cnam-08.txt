          Internet-Draft        CNAM Enumservice          August 2008 
           



           
          Abstract 
           
          This document registers the Enumservice 'pstndata' and 
          subtype 'cnam' using the URI scheme 'pstndata:' as per the 
          IANA registration process defined in the ENUM specification, 
          RFC 3761 and registers a new URI type 'pstndata:'.  
              
          This data is used to facilitate the transfer of Calling Name 
          Delivery (CNAM) data for calls that originate on the Public 
          Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) that may be displayed on 
          VoIP or other Real-time Client User Agents (CUA). The 
          pstndata URI is created to facilitate this transfer, however 
          this URI may be used to transport other PSTN data in the 
          future.

          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", 
          "SHALLNOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
          "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as 
          described in RFC 2119 [16].  
              
             1.                     Introduction 
              
           RFC 3761 (ENUM) [1] is a system that transforms E.164 
          numbers (The International Public Telecommunication Number 
          Plan, ITU-T Recommendation E.164) [2] into domain names and 
          then uses the Domain Name System (DNS), RFC 1034 [3] and 
          Naming Authority Pointer Records (NAPTR) records in the 
          Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) RFC 3403 [4]) to 
          query the services that are available for a specific domain 
          name.  
              
          This document registers an Enumservice 'cnam' according to 
          the guidelines given in RFC 3761 [1], to be used for 
          provisioning a NAPTR [4] resource record to indicate a type 
          of functionality associated with an end point and/or 
          telephone number. The registration is defined within the DDDS 
          (Dynamic Delegation Discovery System 
          [4][5][6][7][8]) hierarchy, for use with the "E2U" DDDS 
          Application defined in RFC 3761. This document also 
          registers an IANA URI type 'pstndata' per the requirements of 
          RFC 4395[15].  
              
          The purpose of this Enumservice is to enable service 
          providers to place Calling Name Delivery information (CNAM) 
          into ENUM databases or to send ENUM queries to a protocol 
          converter that would have access to the Signaling System 7 
          (SS7) Network.  This, in turn, could enable such parties to 
          offer Calling Name Delivery services using the technology 
          provided by RFC 3761 [1].  
            
          The service parameters defined in RFC 3761 [1] dictate that a 
          'type' and one or more 'subtype' should be specified.  Within 
          this set of specifications the convention is assumed that the 
          'type' (being the more generic term) defines the service and 
          at least one of the 'subtype' may indicate the URI scheme.  
              
          In this document, one type is specified, 'pstndata' and one 
          subtype 'cnam' with the URI scheme specified, 'pstndata:'.

             2.                   Protocol Design Considerations.  
              
          The design of this protocol was influenced by several 
          factors. RFC 3761 [1] has become the defacto query-response 
          protocol of choice for a variety of data types associated 
          with E.164 numbering and addressing including data not 
          necessarily associated with a SIP [18] or other 
          communications session. RFC 3761 [1] is already being used by 
          service providers to query for data that has significant 
          privacy or security issues associated with it. RFC 4769 [17], 
          for instance, describes an Enumservice that associates an 
          E.164 number with a PSTN Local Routing Number. An Enumservice 
          for CNAM data has similar design requirements of being used 
          in private and closed systems.  
              
          Communications service providers are concerned with the 
          impact of call setup up times on the overall user experience. 
          There is a strong desire to maintain a single query mechanism 
          for data involving E.164 phone numbers and not complicate 
          call processing applications with multiple protocol 
          mechanisms. Were the query for CNAM data to require a 
          secondary protocol mechanism such as LDAP or IRIS to retrieve 
          the data, it could significantly impact call setup times.  
              
             3.                  Definition of PSTN CNAM Data  
           
          Calling Name data is a string of up to 15 ASCII [9] 
          characters of information associated with a specific calling 
          party number [10] [11][12][13][14].  In the Public Switched 
          Telephone Network (PSTN) this data is sent by the originating 
          network only at the specific request of the terminating 
          network via a SS7 Transaction Capabilities Application Part 
          (TCAP) response message. 
               
             4.                   The PSTNDATA URI  
               
          This document proposes a new URI scheme 'PSTNDATA:' 
          specifically to carry PSTN data in general and CNAM data 
          specifically.  
               
              pstndatauri  = "pstndata:" datatype ["/" telephone-   
             subscriber ] ";" content 




          R. Shockey - editor     Expires February 2009      [Page 4]

             datatype     = "cnam" 
                          ; Other datatypes can be defined by adding  
                          ; alternative values. 
             content      = [ mediatype ] [ ":base64" ] "," data 
             mediatype    = [ type "/" subtype ] *( ";" parameter ) 
             data         = *urlchar 
             parameter    = attribute "=" value  
           
            
                   
          ANSI standards specify the use of ASCII [9] in the response 
          to TCAP queries for Calling Name data.  This specification 
          does not preclude the use of internationalized characters 
          within the pstn URI, nor does it preclude the use of more 
          than 15 characters. 
            
             5.     Enumservice Privacy Responses and Parameters  
            
          The PSTN defines several values for CNAM data in the event 
          that there are privacy restrictions on the access to that 
          data or that the data is unavailable.  These are defined as 
          "Reason for Absence of Name" in GR-1188 [13], consequently 
          the following responses to a query are reserved.  
                 
          Within the datatype 'cnam' two special content cases with 
          mediatype parameters and data are defined:  
                   
          Calling Name Privacy Indicator: 'unavailable=p,<reason>' 
                 
          This parameter defined as the Calling Name data information 
          may be available but the Calling Party does not wish to have 
          their Calling Name data displayed by Called Party User 
          Agents. 
              
          In this case, the data element is populated with <reason> 
          rather than the Calling Name itself, such as "Private". 
               
          Usage: pstndata:cnam;;unavailable=p,<reason> 
              
          Calling Name Status Indicator  
              
          Definition: 'unavailable=u,<reason>'

          Internet-Draft        CNAM Enumservice          August 2008 
           



          This parameter is defined as there is no Calling Name data 
          for that E.164 number available. 
            
          In this case, the data element is populated with <reason> 
          rather than the Calling Name itself, such as "Unavailable" or 
          "Out of Area". 
              
          Usage: pstndata:cnam;;unavailable=u,<reason>  
             
             6.                    Distribution of CNAM Data  
                 
          The distribution of CNAM data is often highly restricted. The 
          NAPTR records described herein should not be part of the 
          e164.arpa DNS tree.  Distribution of this NAPTR data would be 
          either within a service providers internal network, or on a 
          private basis between one or more parties using a variety of 
          security mechanisms to prohibit general public access.  
                 
          If such data was distributed in an open DNS system, a 
          national regulatory body may have jurisdiction, especially 
          since CNAM information may contain Personally Identifying 
          Information.  Such a body may choose to restrict distribution 
          of the data in such a way that it may not pass over that 
          country's national borders.  How Personally Identifying 
          Information is collected, distributed and subsequently 
          regulated is out of the scope of this document  
                 
                 
             7.                    Enumservice CNAM Response Examples  
            
          This section documents several examples of how this protocol 
          is used for illustrative purposes only.

             8.                  Usage Considerations      
                
          Typically, the Calling Name data in the PSTN is delivered to 
          the called party during the first silent interval after the 
          first ring of the phone. (see GR-1188 requirement R3-341 
          [13]).  If the Called party answers the call before this, 
          Calling Name data may not be delivered.  
                
          This protocol could be invoked, for example, when a user 
          agent within a service providers network receives an INVITE 
          without a display name present. 
                  
          The exact mechanism or determination of when to issue an 
          ENUM-CNAM request, and the formatting of SIP [18] messages is 
          beyond the scope of this document.  
              
             9.                  Privacy Considerations  
            
          It is assumed that carriers, service providers, or other 
          organizations that originate Calling Name data will not 
          publish such information in a globally visible DNS tree, 
          such as e164.arpa for reasons of personal privacy protection 
          unless such publication is consistent with national 
          regulatory policy.

          Service providers and other organizations will probably 
          privately exchange and publish this data in their internally 
          cached ENUM databases, which is only able to be queried by 
          trusted elements of their network, such as soft switches and 
          SIP [18] proxy servers. 
               
          Service providers using this query response technique are 
          advised that many national jurisdictions have strict 
          regulations on the use of Calling Name data and that National 
          Regulatory Authorities may have special regulations that 
          permit subscribers to block the use of such data before call 
          setup.  Other jurisdictions have services known as anonymous 
          caller rejection, meaning that calls made from a system where 
          Calling Line Identification and Calling Name data are blocked 
          are prevented from establishing a session.  
              
              
             10.                    Security Considerations  
           
          Use of the CNAM Enumservice shall either be within a service 
          providers internal network, or on a private basis between one 
          or more parties using a variety of security mechanisms to 
          prevent general public access.  It should be noted that this 
          content type is designed to carry potentially personal 
          information and as such, may be subject to restrictions 
          within various national jurisdictions. 
              
          In many cases, the actual information that needs to be 
          protected is the combination of the Name associated with the 
          Telephone Number or the association of the name with the 
          telephone call.  So, it will be necessary to protect the 
          response to the query that provides the association between 
          the two elements. 
              
          The CNAM Enumservice defined in this document is assumed to 
          be used in an environment where elements are trusted and 
          where attackers are not supposed to have access to the 
          protocol messages between those elements.  Traffic protection 
          between network elements is sometimes achieved by using IPSec 
          [15] and sometimes by physically protecting the underlying 
          network.  In any case, the provider should ensure that 
          measures are taken to prevent both fraud and unauthorized

          Encryption. 
              
                                                                      
             11.                    IANA Considerations  
              
          This document registers the 'cnam' Enumservice using the type 
          'pstn' and the subtype 'cnam' in the Enumservice registry 
          described in the IANA considerations in RFC 3761 [1].  
          Details of this registration are provided in sections 13 and 
          14 of this document.  
              
          This document also registers with the IANA the URI 
          'pstndata:' per RFC 4395 [15]  
                    
           
          11.1 IANA Enumservice Registration for "pstndata" with 
          subtype "cnam"  
              
               Enumservice Name: "cnam"  
               Enumservice Type: "pstndata"

               URI Schemes: "pstndata:"  
              
                  Functional Specification:  
              
          This Enumservice indicates that a resource record contains 
          Calling Name Delivery Information that can be addressed by 
          the associated 'pstndata:' URI scheme in order to facilitate 
          the display of Calling Party information from a PSTN endpoint 
          to a VoIP Client User Agent or other application.

               URI scheme semantics.  
              
          The PSTN defines several values for CNAM data in the event 
          that there are privacy restrictions on the access to that 
          data or that the data is unavailable.  These are defined as

          "Reason for Absence of Name" in GR-1188 [13], consequently 
          the following responses to a query are reserved.  
              
          Within the datatype 'cnam' two special content cases with 
          mediatype parameters and data are defined:  
                   
          Calling Name Privacy Indicator: 'unavailable=p,<reason>' 
                 
          This parameter defined as the Calling Name data information 
          may be available but the Calling Party does not wish to have 
          their Calling Name data displayed by Called Party User 
          Agents. 
              
          In this case, the data element is populated with <reason> 
          rather than the Calling Name itself, such as "Private". 
               
          Usage: pstndata:cnam;;unavailable=p,<reason> 
              
          Calling Name Status Indicator  
              
          Definition: 'unavailable=u,<reason>' 
              
          This parameter is defined as there is no Calling Name data 
          for that E.164 number available.  
              
          In this case, the data element is populated with <reason> 
          rather than the Calling Name itself, such as "Unavailable" or 
          "Out of Area". 
              
          Usage: pstndata:cnam;;unavailable=u,<reason>      
           
          Encoding considerations.  
              
          The purpose of this URI is to enable service providers to 
          place   Calling Name Delivery information (CNAM) into RFC 
          3761 [1] databases or to send ENUM queries to a protocol 
          converter that would have access to the Signaling System 7 
          (SS7) Network.  This, in turn, could enable such parties to 
          offer Calling Name Delivery services using the technology 
          provided by RFC 3761[1].  
              
          The information stored in these databases can be encoded to 
          facilitate storage and retrieval operations.  The type of

          encoding used is identified using appropriate media type 
          parameters.  If not otherwise identified, character data is 
          presumed to be encoded using US-ASCII.  
           
          Applications and/or protocols that use this URI scheme name.  
           
          This URI scheme is intended for use in ENUM RFC 3761 [1] 
          databases.  
              
          Interoperability considerations. 
            
          The URI is designed to be used specifically in conjunction 
          with trusted systems that utilize the RFC 3761 [1] databases.   
              
          Security considerations:  
            
          The distribution of CNAM data is often highly restricted.    
          Distribution of this data would typically be either within a 
          service providers internal network, or on a private basis 
          between one or more parties using a variety of security 
          mechanisms to prohibit general public access.  It should be 
          noted that this content type is designed to carry potentially 
          personal information and as such, may be subject to 
          restrictions within various national jurisdictions. In 
          many cases, the actual information that needs to be protected 
          is the combination of the Name associated with the Telephone 
          Number or the association of the name with the telephone 
          call.  So, it will be necessary to protect the response to 
          the query that provides the association between the two 
          elements. 
              
          The pstn URI defined in this document is assumed to be used 
          in an environment where elements are trusted and where 
          attackers are not supposed to have access to the protocol 
          messages between those elements.  Traffic protection between 
          network elements is sometimes achieved by using IPSec [15] 
          and sometimes by physically protecting the underlying 
          network. In any case, the provider should ensure that 
          measures are taken to prevent both fraud and unauthorized 
          disclosure by using a combination of authentication and 
          Encryption.
