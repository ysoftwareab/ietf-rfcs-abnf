Abstract 
    
   There are requirements for the support of networks ccomprising LSRs

   Generalized Multi Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control plane 
   instance, referred to as GMPLS Multi-Layer Networks/Multi-Region 
   Networks (MLN/MRN). This document defines extensions to GMPLS routing

   and signaling protocols so as to support the operation of GMPLS 
   Multi-Layer/Multi-Region Networks. 
    
Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119. 
    
   In addition the reader is assumed to be familiar with the concepts 
   developed in [RFC3945], [RFC3471], and [RFC4202] as well as 
   [RFC4206] and [RFC4201]. 
    
1. Introduction 
    
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC 3945] 
   extends MPLS to handle multiple switching technologies: packet 
   switching (PSC), layer-two switching (L2SC), TDM switching (TDM), 
   wavelength switching (LSC) and fiber switching (FSC). A GMPLS 
   switching type (PSC, TDM, etc.) describes the ability of a node to 
   forward data of a particular data plane technology, and uniquely 
   identifies a control plane region. LSP Regions are defined in 
   [RFC4206]. A network comprised of multiple switching types (e.g. PSC 
   and TDM) controlled by a single GMPLS control plane instance is 
   called a Multi-Region Network (MRN). 
    
   A data plane layer is a collection of network resources capable of 
   terminating and/or switching data traffic of a particular format. 
   For example, LSC, TDM VC-11 and TDM VC-4-64c represent three 
   different layers. A network comprising transport nodes with 
   different data plane switching layers controlled either by a single 
   GMPLS control plane instance is called a Multi-Layer Network (MLN).  
    
   The applicability of GMPLS to multiple switching technologies 
   provides the unified control management approach for both LSP 
   provisioning and recovery. Indeed one of the main motivations for 
   unifying the capabilities and operations GMPLS control plane is the 
   desire to support multi LSP-region [RFC4206] routing and Traffic 
   Engineering (TE) capability. For instance, this enables effective 
   network resource utilization of both the Packet/Layer2 LSP regions 
   and the Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) or Lambda LSP regions in 
   high capacity networks. 
    
   The rationales for investigating GMPLS controlled multi-layer/multi-
   region networks context are detailed in [MRN-REQ]. The corresponding 
   motivations in terms of the GMPLS protocol suite are summarized here 
   below: 
   - The maintenance of multiple instances of the control plane on 
     devices hosting more than one switching capability not only (and

     obviously) increases the complexity of their interactions but also 
     increases the total amount of processing individual instances would 
     handle. 
   - The merge of both data and control plane addressing spaces helps 
     in avoiding multiple identification for the same object (a link for 
     instance or more generally any network resource), on the other hand 
     such aggregation does not impact the separation between the control 
     and the data plane. 
   - The collaboration between associated control planes (packet/framed 
     data planes) and non-associated control planes (SONET/SDH, G.709, 
     etc.) is facilitated due to the capability of hooking the  
     associated in-band signaling to the IP terminating interfaces of  
     the control plane. 
   - Resource management and policies to be applied at the edges of 
     such environment is facilitated (less control to management 
     interactions) and more scalable (through the use of aggregated 
     information). 
   - Multi-region/multi-layer traffic engineering is facilitated as TE-      
     links from distinct regions/layers are stored within the same TE    
     Database 
      
   Detailed requirements for Multi-Layer/Region Networks are spelt out 
   in [MLN-REQ]. An evaluation of existing GMPLS protocols against 
   these requirements is discussed in [MLN-EVAL], which identifies 
   several areas where protocol extensions are required and provides 
   guidelines for such extensions. 
    
   The next sections provide the operational aspects in terms of routing 
   and signaling for such environments as well as the extensions 
   required to instrument GMPLS to control such environments. In this 
   context, this document defines GMPLS routing and signaling extensions 
   that follow the requirements detailed in [MRN-REQ]. These extensions 
   are proposed in-line with the analysis of the GMPLS capabilities to 
   accommodate multiple switching capable networks as evaluated in [MRN-
   EVAL]. 
    
2. Summary of the Requirements and Evaluation  
    
   As identified in [MRN-EVAL] most of MLN/MRN requirements rely on 
   mechanisms and procedures that are out of the scope of the GMPLS 
   protocols, and thus do not require any GMPLS protocol extensions. 
   They rely on local procedures and policies, and on specific TE 
   mechanisms and algorithms. 
    
   Virtual Network Topology (VNT) computation and reconfiguration, 
   specific TE mechanisms that may for instance rely on PCE based 
   mechanisms and protocols. These mechanisms are outside the scope of 
   GMPLS protocols.

   Four areas for extensions of GMPLS protocols and procedures have been 
   identified: 
    
      - GMPLS routing extension for the advertisement of the  
        internal adaptation capability of hybrid nodes. 
    
      - GMPLS signaling extension for constrained multi-region  
        signaling (SC inclusion/exclusion) 
    
      - GMPLS signaling extension for the setup/deletion of    
        the virtual TE-links (as well as exact trigger for its actual  
        provisioning)  
    
      - GMPLS routing and signaling extension for graceful TE-link  
        deletion (covered in [GR-TELINK]). 
    
   The first three are addressed in Sections 3, 4 and 5, respectively, 
   of this document. The fourth is addressed in [GR-TELINK]. 
    
3. Interface adaptation capability descriptor (IACD) 
    
   In the MRN context, nodes supporting more than one switching 
   capability on at least one interface are called Hybrid nodes. Hybrid 
   nodes contain at least two distinct switching elements that are 
   interconnected by internal links to provide adaptation between the 
   supported switching capabilities. These internal links have finite 
   capacities and must be taken into account when computing the path of 
   a multi-region TE-LSP. 
    
   The advertisement of the internal adaptation capability is required 
   as it provides critical information when performing multi-region path 
   computation. 
    
3.1 Overview 
    
   In an MRN environment, some LSRs could contain, under the control of 
   a single GMPLS instance, multiple switching capabilities such as PSC 
   and TDM or PSC and Lambda Switching Capability (LSC). 
    
   These nodes, hosting multiple Interface Switching Capabilities 
   (ISC), just like other nodes (hosting a single Interface Switching 
   Capability) are required to hold and advertise resource information 
   on link states and topology. They also may have to consider certain 
   portions of internal node resources to terminate hierarchical label 
   switched paths (LSPs), since circuit switch capable units such as 
   TDMs, LSCs, and FSCs require rigid resources. For example, a node 
   with PSC+LSC hierarchical switching capability can switch a Lambda 
   LSP but may not be able to can never terminate the Lambda LSP if

draft-papadimitriou-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-extensions-03.txt        Oct. 2006 
 
 
   there is no unused adaptation capability between the LSC and the PSC 
   switching capabilities. 
    
   Another example occurs when L2SC (Ethernet) switching can be adapted 
   in LAPS X.86 and GFP for instance before reaching the TDM switching 
   matrix. Similar circumstances can occur, if a switching fabric that 
   supports both PSC and L2SC functionalities is assembled with LSC 
   interfaces enabling "lambda" encoding. In the switching fabric, some 
   interfaces can terminate Lambda LSPs and perform frame (or cell) 
   switching whilst other interfaces can terminate Lambda LSPs and 
   perform packet switching.  
    
   Therefore, within multi-region networks, the advertisement of the 
   so-called adaptation capability to terminate LSPs (not the interface 
   capability since the latter can be inferred from the bandwidth 
   available for each switching capability) provides critical 
   information to take into account when performing multi-region path 
   computation. This concept enables a node to discriminate the remote 
   nodes (and thus allows their selection during path computation) with 
   respect to their adaptation capability e.g. to terminate LSPs at the 
   PSC or LSC level. 
    
   Hence, we introduce the idea of discriminating the (internal) 
   adaptation capability from the (interface) switching capability by 
   considering an interface adaptation capability descriptor. 
    
3.2 Interface Adaptation Capability Descriptor (IACD) Format 
    
   The interface switching capability descriptor (IACD) provides the 
   information for the forwarding/switching) capability only.  
    
   The IACD sub-TLV format is as follows. In IS-IS, this is a sub-TLV of 
   the Extended IS Reachability TLV (see [RFC 3784]) with type TBD. In 
   OSPF, it is defined as a sub-TLV of the Link TLV (see [RFC 3630]), 
   with type TBD.

   where: 
    
   - first Switching Capability (SC) field (byte 1): lower switching   
     capability (as defined for the existing ISC sub-TLV) 
   - first Encoding field (byte 2): as defined for the existing ISC  
     sub-TLV  
   - second SC value (byte 3): upper switching capability  (new)  
   - second encoding value (byte 4): set to the encoding of the  
     available adaptation pool and to 0xFF when the corresponding SC    
     value has no access to the wire (i.e. there is no ISC sub-TLV for  
     this upper switching capability)  
    
   Multiple sub-TLVs may be present within a given TE Link TLV / 
   extended IS reachability TLV and the bandwidth simply provides an 
   indication of resources still available to perform insertion/ 
   extraction for a given adaptation (pool concept). 
    
4. Multi-Region Signaling 
    
   Section 8.2 of [RFC4206] specifies that when a region boundary node 
   receives a Path message, the node determines whether it is at the 
   edge of an LSP region with respect to the ERO carried in the 
   message. If the node is at the edge of a region, it must then 
   determine the other edge of the region with respect to the ERO, 
   using the IGP database. The node then extracts from the ERO the 
   subsequence of hops from itself to the other end of the region. 
    
   The node then compares the subsequence of hops with all existing FA-
   LSPs originated by the node:  
   - if a match is found, that FA-LSP has enough unreserved bandwidth  
     for the LSP being signaled, and the PID of the FA-LSP is  
     compatible with the PID of the LSP being signaled, the node uses  
     that FA-LSP as follows. The Path message for the original LSP is 
     sent to the egress of the FA-LSP. The PHOP in the message is the  
     address of the node at the head-end of the FA-LSP. Before sending  
     the Path message, the ERO in that message is adjusted by removing  
     the subsequence of the ERO that lies in the FA-LSP, and replacing

draft-papadimitriou-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-extensions-03.txt        Oct. 2006 
 
 
     it with just the end point of the FA-LSP. 
   - if no existing FA-LSP is found, the node sets up a new FA-LSP.  
     That is, it initiates a new LSP setup just for the FA-LSP.   
    
   Applying this procedure, in a MRN environment MAY lead to setup one-
   hop FA-LSPs between each node. Therefore, considering that the path 
   computation is able to take into account richness of information with 
   regard to the SC available on given nodes belonging to the path, it 
   is consistent to provide enough signaling information to indicate the 
   SC to be used and on over which link. Particularly, in case a TE 
   link has multiple SC advertised as part of its ISCD sub-TLVs, an ERO 
   does not allow selecting a particular SC. 
    
   Limiting modifications to existing RSVP-TE procedures [RFC3473] and 
   referenced, this document defines a new Switching Capability sub-
   object of the eXclude Route Object [XRO]. This sub-object enables 
   (when desired) the explicit identification of (at least one) 
   switching capability to be excluded from the resource selection 
   process described here above.  
    
   Including this sub-object as part of the XRO that explicitly 
   indicates which SCs have to be excluded (before initiating the 
   procedure described here above) solves the ambiguous choice among SCs 
   that are potentially used along a given path and give the possibility 
   to optimize resource usage on a multi-region basis. Note that 
   implicit SC inclusion is easily supported by explicitly excluding 
   other SCs (e.g. to include LSC, it is required to exclude PSC, L2SC, 
   TDM and FSC). 
    
   Note: usage of the EXRS is under investigation. 
    
4.1 SC Subobject Encoding 
    
   The contents of an EXCLUDE_ROUTE object defined in [XRO] are a 
   series of variable-length data items called subobjects. This 
   document defines the SC subobject of the XRO (Type TBD), its 
   encoding and processing. 
    
   Subobject Type TBD: Switching Capability 
    
      0                   1                   2                   3

             avoided with respect to the preceding numbered (Type 1 or  
             Type 2) or unnumbered interface (Type) subobject 
     
   This sub-object must follow the set of numbered or unnumbered 
   interface sub-objects to which this sub-object refers. In case, of 
   loose hop ERO subobject, this sub-object must precede the loose-hop 
   sub-object identifying the tail-end node/interface of the traversed 
   region(s). 
    
   Furthermore, it is expected, when label sub-object are following 
   numbered or unnumbered interface sub-objects, that the label value is 
   compliant with the SC capability to be explicitly excluded. 
    
5. Virtual TE link 
    
   Two techniques can be used for the setup operation and maintenance of 
   Virtual TE links. The corresponding GMPLS protocols extensions are 
   described in this section. 
    
5.1 Edge-to-edge Association    
    
   This approach that does not require state maintenance on transit LSRs 
   rely on extensions to the GMPLS RSVP-TE Call procedure ([GMPLS-
   CALL]).  
    
   This technique consists of exchanging identification and TE 
   attributes information directly between TE link end points. These TE 
   link end-points correspond to the LSP head and tail-end points of of 
   the LSPs that will be established. The end-points MUST belong to the 
   same region through the establishment of a call between terminating 
   LSRs. 
    
   Once the call is established the resulting association populates the 
   local TEDB and the resulting TE link is advertized as any other TE 
   link. The latter can then be used to attract traffic. Once an upper 
   layer/lower region LSP makes use of this TE link. A set of one or 
   more LSPs must be initially established before the FA LSP can be used 
   for nesting the incoming LSP. 
    
   In order to distinguish usage of such call from a classical call (as 
   defined e.g. in [RFC4139]), a CALL ATTRIBUTE object is introduced. 
    
5.1.1 CALL_ATTRIBUTES Object 
 
 
 D.Papadimitriou et al. - Expires April 2007                  [Page 8] 

draft-papadimitriou-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-extensions-03.txt        Oct. 2006 
 
 
    
   The CALL_ATTRIBUTES object is used to signal attributes required in 
   support of a call, or to indicate the nature or use of a call. It is 
   built on the LSP-ATTRIBUTES object defined in [RFC4420]. 
    
   The CALL_ATTRIBUTES object class is 201 of the form 11bbbbbb. This 
   C-Num value (see [RFC2205], Section 3.10) ensures that LSRs that do 
   not recognize the object pass it on transparently.  
    
   One C-Type is defined, C-Type = 1 for CALL Attributes. This object is 
   optional and may be placed on Notify messages to convey additional 
   information about the desired attributes of the call. 
 
5.1.2 Processing 
    
   Specifically, if an egress (or intermediate) LSR does not support the 
   object, it forwards it unexamined and unchanged.  This facilitates 
   the exchange of attributes across legacy networks that do not support 
   this new object. 
    
   The CALL_ATTRIBUTES object may be used to report call operational 
   state on a Notify message.   
 
      CALL_ATTRIBUTES class = 201, C-Type = 1

      The Attributes TLVs are encoded as described in Section 3. 
    
5.1.3 Attributes TLVs 
    
   Attributes carried by the CALL_ATTRIBUTE object are encoded within 
   TLVs. One or more TLVs may be present in each object. 
    
   There are no ordering rules for TLVs, and no interpretation should be 
   placed on the order in which TLVs are received. 
    
   Each TLV is encoded as follows. 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3

      Type 
    
        The identifier of the TLV. 
    
      Length 
    
        The length of the Value field in bytes.  Thus, if no Value 
        field is present the Length field contains the value zero. 
        Each Value field must be zero padded at the end to take it up 
        to a four byte boundary -- the padding is not included in the 
        length so that a one byte value would be encoded in an eight 
        byte TLV with Length field set to one. 
    
      Value 
    
         The data for the TLV padded as described above. 
    
   TLV Type 1 indicates the Attributes Flags TLV. Other TLV types may be 
   defined in the future with type values assigned by IANA (see Section 
   11.2). The Attributes Flags TLV may be present in a CALL_ATTRIBUTES 
   object.   
    
   The Attribute Flags TLV value field is an array of units of 32 flags 
   numbered from the most significant bit as bit zero. The Length field 
   for this TLV is therefore always a multiple of 4 bytes, regardless of 
   the number of bits carried and no padding is required. 
    
   Unassigned bits are considered as reserved and MUST be set to zero on 
   transmission by the originator of the object. Bits not contained in 
   the TLV MUST be assumed to be set to zero. If the TLV is absent 
   either because it is not contained in the CALL_ATTRIBUTES object or 
   because those objects are themselves absent, all processing MUST be 
   performed as though the bits were present and set to zero. That is to 
   say, assigned bits that are not present either because the TLV is 
   deliberately foreshortened or because the TLV is not included MUST be 
   treated as though they are present and are set to zero. 
    
5.1.4 Call inheritance Flag 
    
   This document introduces a specific flag (MSB position bit 0) of the 
   Attributes Flags TLV, to indicate that the association initiated 
   between the end-points belonging to as call is to be mapped into a TE 
   link advertisement.

   The notify message is defined as per [GMPLS-CALL]. Additionally, the 
   notify message must carry an LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object, that 
   allows identifying unnumbered FA-LSPs ([RFC3477], [RFC4206], 
   [RFC4206-bis]) and numbered FA-LSPs ([RFC4206], [RFC4206-bis]). 
 
5.2. Soft-FA approach                            
    
   The Soft FA approach consists of setting up the FA LSP at the control 
   plane level without actually committing resources in the data plane. 
   This means that the corresponding LSP exists only in the control 
   plane domain. 
    
   Once such FA is established the corresponding TE link can be 
   advertized following the procedures described in [RFC 4206]. 
    
5.2.1 LSP_REQUIRED ATTRIBUTES object  
    
   The LSP ATTRIBUTES object is defined in [RFC4420]. The present 
   document defines a new flag in the existing Attributes Flags TLV 
   numbered as Type 1. The latter is defined as the pre-planned LSP 
   Flag.  
    
   The position of this flag is TBD in accordance with IANA assignment. 
   This flag is defined to be part of the LSP_REQUIRED ATTRIBUTE object 
   and follows processing of [RFC4420] for that object. 
    
   That is, LSRs that do not recognize the object reject the LSP setup 
   effectively saying that they do not support the attributes requested.  
   Indeed, the newly defined attribute requires examination at all 
   transit LSRs.   
    
   The pre-planned LSP Flag can take one of the following values: 
    
   o) When set to 0 this means that the LSP should be fully provisioned. 
   Absence of this flag (hence corresponding TLV) is therefore compliant 
   with the signaling message processing per [RFC3473]) 
    
   o) When set to 1 this means that the LSP should be provisioned in the 
   control plane only. 
    
   If an LSP is established with the pre-planned Flag set to 1, no 
   resources are committed at the data plane level. The operation of 
   committing data plane resources occurs by re-signaling the same LSP 
   with the pre-planned Flag set to 0. It is RECOMMENDED that no other 
   modifications are made to other RSVP objects during this operation. 
   That is each intermediate node, processing a Flag transiting from 1 
   to 0 shall only be concerned with the commitment of data plane

   resources and no other modification of the LSP properties and/or 
   attributes.  
    
   If an LSP is established with the pre-planned Flag set to 0, it MAY 
   be re-signaled by setting the Flag to 1.   
    
5.2.2 Path Provisioned LSPs 
    
   There is a difference in between an LSP that is established with 0 
   bandwidth (path provisioning) and an LSP that is established with a 
   certain bandwidth value not committed at the data plane level (i.e. 
   pre-planned LSP).  
    
   However, the former is currently not possible using the GMPLS 
   protocol suite (following technology specific SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC 
   definition). Indeed, Traffic Parameters such as those defined in [RFC 
   4606] do not support setup of 0 bandwidth LSPs. 
    
   Mechanisms for provisioning (pre-planned or not) LSP with 0 bandwidth 
   will be described in next release of this document. 
    
6. Backward compatibility 
    
   TBD 
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   In its current version, this memo does not introduce new security 
   consideration from the ones already detailed in the GMPLS protocol 
   suite.
