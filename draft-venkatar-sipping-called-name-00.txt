Abstract 
    
   This document describes the expected business telephony requirements 
   for delivering called party name towards SIP entities. A couple of 
   mechanisms exist to deliver calling name and number to the called 
   party. None exist for exposing the called party name or preferred 
   identity to the calling party. This draft proposes a mechanism to 
   provide this capability.

Applicability 
 
   This draft describes the modification to the P-Asserted-Identity [3] 
   extensions to SIP [2] that enables a network of SIP entities to 
   exchange called party information in a trusted network. The use of 
   this extension follows the guidelines specified in RFC 3325 [3]. 
   This document does not describe how to use network elements to 
   determine the identity of an entity.

Introduction 
    
   Delivering Called Name and Number is one of the many services 
   provided by traditional business communication systems, and a 
   service expected by most users of business communication systems. 
   This same functionality is required in next-generation SIP based 
   deployments.  
    
   The baseline SIP specification, RFC 3261 [2] allows called UAÆs (the 
   UAS) to place their display name and the number in SIP headers in 
   order to indicate their identity to the calling UA. The "Contact" 
   SIP header is one such example of this. However, use of the Contact 
   header does not solve all the requirements for providing called name 
   and number. 
    
   This document presents a method to extend a simple mechanism to 
   provide called party identification based on the requirements 
   detailed below. 
    
        
Requirements for Called Name Delivery 
 
     . The name and number of the UAS is delivered to the UAC before 
        the call is established. 
 
     . In the case of calls to numbers like hunt-groups or ACD numbers 
        that are forked, every UAS that receives the INVITE will place 
        its local contact information in the response to this request. 
        The UAC will therefore know that the call was placed to an ACD 
        group number but will not know which of these agents the call 
        is being offered to. 
    
     . A feature proxy providing called name look up services for a UA 
        might have policies that define a particular SIP URL to be 
        displayed in a particular format and/or language that differs 
     
   V. Venkataramanan et. al.                                         3 
Internet Draft               called-name                     6/2/2003 
    
        from the display preferences of the UAS that is registered for 
        this URL. If such a conflict arises, the display policy 
        implemented on the feature proxy will override that of the UAS. 
 
     . A feature proxy providing called name lookup services for a 
        user community may contain a list of users in a centralized 
        directory database with content differing from that of the UAS. 
        If this is the case, the information provided by the feature 
        proxy will be displayed, rather than that of the UAS.  
 
     . For URLÆs that are serviced via a PSTN gateway, the amount of 
        information that can be displayed about a called party is 
        restricted. Under such circumstances, a local feature proxy may 
        be configured to provide information such as called name to the 
        UA. 
 
     . Once a session is established, the UA and UAS information may 
        undergo many changes (transfer to a third party, the caller 
        gets parked and picked up by another end user, etc). In such 
        cases, it is desirable that the UA and the UAS are refreshed 
        with the current calling and called names. 
    
Overview 
    
   Some of the above requirements are already supported in the base SIP 
   specification [2]. The UAS receiving the INVITE can place its 
   display name and number (its SIP-URL) in the "Contact" header in a 
   1xx or a 200-class response, which can be rendered to the user by 
   the UA. However, this does not cover or support all of the 
   requirements specified above.  
    
   For example, in cases where the call is forked to multiple user 
   agents (like applications like ACD or hunt groups), while the ôToö 
   header in the INVITE would indicate to the UAS receiving the INVITE 
   some information as to where the call was initially directed 
   towards, it would not provide details as to what the ôname 
   corresponding to this number isö or what to set the Contact display 
   name so that the ôdesiredö value may be rendered back to the UAC. 
   Arguably some of this may be achieved by local configuration of some 
   sort (tell the UAS what display name to use based on the To URL), 
   but it necessitates that the UA's involved in all types of call 
   flows know about all features, call redirection, and/or services 
   offered by the network to be able to deliver this service correctly.  
    
   Further services enabled by a feature proxy require that the proxy 
   be able to add this information in a SIP message. The Contact header 
   is a non-modifiable header by proxies in a 200 response per table 2 
   of the base SIP specification [2].  
    
   The draft proposes to use the P-Asserted-Identity header field as 
   described in RFC 3325 [3] in SIP responses to achieve rendering 
   called name and number to the UAC.

Internet Draft               called-name                     6/2/2003 
    
   A proxy server that handles a SIP response message, or generates a 
   100 Trying response on receipt of an INVITE, MAY after inspecting 
   the UACÆs profile add or modify the P-Asserted-Identity header in a 
   SIP response message before forwarding the same to the UAC or its 
   next hop. The guidelines for adding or removing the P-Asserted-
   Identity in responses, remains as defined in RFC 3325 [3]. Simply 
   stated, the P-Asserted-Identity header is removed when forwarding 
   responses towards un-trusted UAÆs or proxies.  
    
Proxy Behavior 
    
   Proxies are allowed to remove and/or add P-Asserted-Identity header 
   while processing any class of response. Any proxy that decides to 
   insert a P-Asserted-Identity in a SIP response message MUST do so, 
   only if the response being forwarded is to a trusted SIP entity. 
   Consequently, a proxy forwarding a SIP response MUST remove the P-
   Asserted-Identity header if the same is being forwarded to an un-
   trusted entity. This is in conformance with the rules outlined in 
   RFC 3325 [3].  
    
User Agent Client Behavior 
    
   The same rules as those detailed for a User Agent Server in RFC 3325 
   [3] apply to the UAC while handling the header in a SIP response. 
   The draft RECOMMENDS that user agent render the contents of this 
   header to the end user. The draft also RECOMMENDS that the UAC 
   consider the identity provided in P-Asserted-Identity header field 
   more trust-worthy than the ôFromö and ôContactö header field of a 
   response. 
    
The P-Asserted-Identity Header 
    
   This draft modifies the following entry to table 2 of [2]: 
    
    
   Header Field          where    proxy  INV  BYE  CANCEL  OPTIONS  REG 
   ------------          -----    -----  ---  ---  ------  -------  --- 
       
   P-Asserted-Identity    100      adm    o    o     -        -      - 
   P-Asserted-Identity    1xx      adm    o    o     -        -      - 
   P-Asserted-Identity    2xx-6xx  adm    o    o     -        -      - 
    
                                         SUB  NOT  REF  INF  UPD  PRA 
                                         ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  --- 
                                          -    -    o    -    o    - 
    
Open Issues 
    
   Is the usage of the P-Asserted-Identity header for accomplishing the 
   same acceptable? 
    
Security Considerations

   Since the draft extends the support of the P-Asserted-Identity 
   header defined in [3], all security considerations detailed in [3] 
   apply to this draft as well.
