        Packet Delivery Deadline time in 6LoWPAN Routing Header
                    draft-ietf-6lo-deadline-time-03

Abstract

   This document specifies a new type for the 6LoWPAN routing header
   containing the delivery deadline time for data packets.  The deadline
   time enables forwarding and scheduling decisions for time critical
   IoT M2M applications that need deterministic delay guarantees over
   constrained networks and operate within time-synchronized networks.

1.  Introduction

   Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are likely to be deployed for
   real time industrial applications requiring end-to-end delay
   guarantees [I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases].  A Deterministic Network
   ("detnet") typically requires some data packets to reach their
   receivers within strict time bounds.  Intermediate nodes use the
   deadline information to make appropriate packet forwarding and
   scheduling decisions to meet the time bounds.

   The draft [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-dispatch] specifies the 6LoWPAN
   Routing Header (6LoRH), compression schemes for RPL routing (source
   routing) operation [RFC6554], header compression of RPL Packet
   Information [RFC6553], and IP-in-IP encapsulation.  This document
   specifies a new Deadline-6LoRHE type for the 6LoWPAN Dispatch Page 1,
   so that the deadline time of data packets can be included within the
   6LoWPAN routing header.  This document also specifies handling of the

   deadline time when packets traverse through time-synchronized
   networks operating in different timezones or distinct reference
   clocks.  Time synchronization techniques need not be mandated by this
   specificiation.  There are a number of standards available for this
   purpose, including IEEE 1588 [ieee-1588], IEEE 802.1AS [dot1AS-2011],
   IEEE 802.15.4-2015 TSCH [dot15-tsch], and more.

   The Deadline-6LoRHE can be used in any time synchronized 6Lo network.
   A 6TiSCH network has been used to describe the implementation of the
   Deadline-6LoRHE, but this does not preclude its use in scenarios
   other than 6TiSCH.  For instance, there is a growing interest in
   using 6lo over a BLE mesh network [I-D.ietf-6lo-blemesh] in
   industrial IoT [dotBLEMesh].  BLE mesh time synchronization is also
   being recently explored by the Bluetooth community.  There are also
   cases under consideration in Wi-SUN [Wi-SUN_PHY], [dotWi-SUN].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] [RFC8174].

   This document uses terminology consistent with the terminology used
   in [RFC6550] and [I-D.ietf-6tisch-terminology].  Also, in this
   document, the terms "expiration time", "delivery deadline time", and
   "deadline" are used interchangeably with the same meaning.

3.  6LoRHE Generic Format

   Note: this section is not normative and is included for convenience.
   The generic header format of the 6LoRHE is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-roll-routing-dispatch].  Figure 1 illustrates the 6LoRHE
   generic format.

   o  Type: Type of the 6LoRHE.

   o  length: variable

4.  Deadline-6LoRHE

   The Deadline-6LoRHE (see Figure 3) is an elective 6LoRH (i.e., a
   6LoRHE [RFC8138]) that provides the Deadline Time (DT) for an IPv6
   datagram in a compressed form.  Along with the deadline, the header
   can include the packet Origination Time (OT), the time at which the
   packet is enqueued for transmission, to enable a close estimate of
   the total delay incurred by a packet.  The OT field is initialized by
   the sender using the current time at the outgoing network interface
   through which the packet is forwarded.

   The deadline field contains the value of the delivery deadline time
   for the packet.  The packet SHOULD be delivered to the Receiver
   before this time.

      packet_deadline_time = packet_origination_time + max_delay

   All nodes within the network SHOULD process the Deadline-6LoRHE in
   order to support delay-sensitive deterministic applications.  The
   packet deadline time (DT) and origination time (OT) are represented
   in time units determined by a scaling parameter in the routing
   header.  One of the time units is the Network ASN (Absolute Slot
   Number) which can be used in case of a time slotted synchronized
   network (for instance a 6TiSCH network, where global time is
   maintained in the units of slot lengths of a certain resolution).

   The delay experienced by packets in the network is a useful metric
   for network diagnostics and performance monitoring.  Whenever the
   packets crosses into a network using a different reference clock, the
   Origination Time field is updated to represent the same Origination
   Time, but expressed using the reference clock of the interface into
   the new network.  This is the same as the current time when the
   packet is transmitted into the new network, minus the delay already
   experienced by the packet, say 't'.  In this way, within the newly
   entered network, the packet will appear to have originated 't' time
   units earlier with respect to the reference clock of the new network.

   Origination Time in new network = current_time_in_new_network -
                  delay_already_experienced_in_previous_network(s)

   The following example illustrates the origination time calculation
   when a packet travels between three networks, each in a different
   time zone. 'x' can be 1,2 or 3.

      TxA : Time of arrival of packet in the network 'x'

      TxD : Departure time of packet from the network 'x'

   time synchronized networks along with numerical values as shown in
   Figure 1.

                 Figure 2: Origination Time update example

   There are multiple ways that a packet can be delayed, including
   queuing delay, MAC layer contention delay, serialization delay, and
   propagation delays.  Sometimes there are processing delays as well.
   For the purpose of determining whether or not the deadline has
   already passed, these various delays are not distinguished.

                     Figure 3: Deadline-6LoRHE format

   Length (5 bits): Length represents the total length of the Deadline-
   6LoRHE type measured in octets.

   6LoRH Type: TBD

   O flag (1bit): Indicates the presence of Origination Time field.  '1'
   means the OT field is present, and '0' means it is absent.

   D flag (1 bit): The 'D' flag, set by the Sender, indicates the action
   to be taken when a 6LR detects that the deadline time has elapsed.
   If 'D' bit is 1, then the 6LR MUST drop the packet if the deadline
   time is elapsed.

   If 'D' bit is 0, implies the packet MAY be forwarded on an exception
   basis, if the forwarding node is NOT in a situation of constrained
   resource, and if there are reasons to suspect that downstream nodes
   might find it useful (delay measurements, interpolations, etc.).

   DTL (3 bits): Length of DT field as an unsigned 3-bit integer,
   encoding the length of the field in octets, minus one.

   OTL (3 bits) : Length of OT field as an unsigned 3-bit integer,
   encoding the length of the field in octets, minus one.

      For example, DTL = 000 means the deadline time in the 6LoRHE is 1
      octet (8 bits) long.  Similarly, OTL = 111 means the origination
      time is 8 octets (64 bits) long.

   TU (2 bits) : Indicates the time units for DT and OT fields

      00 : Time represented in microseconds
      01 : Time represented in seconds
      10 : Network ASN
      11 : Reserved

   EXP (3 bits) : Multiplication factor expressed as exponent of 10.

      The value of the DT field is multiplied by 10 to this power, to
      get the actual deadline time in the units represented by TU.  The
      default value of EXP is 000, so that the DT field is unaffected.

   Rsv (3 bits) : Reserved, sent as zero and ignored on receipt

   DT Value (8..64-bit) : An unsigned integer of DTL octets giving the
   Deadline Time value

   OT Value (8..64-bit) : An unsigned integer of OTL octets giving the
   Origination Time value

   Whenever a sender initiates the IP datagram, it includes the
   Deadline-6LoRHE along with other 6LoRH information.

   Example: Consider a 6TiSCH network with time-slot length of 10ms.
   Let the current ASN when the packet is originated be 54400, and the
   maximum allowable delay (max_delay) for the packet delivery is 1
   second from the packet origination, then:

      deadline_time = packet_origination_time + max_delay
      = 55400 + 100 (in Network ASNs)
      = 55500(Network ASNs)

   Deadline-6LoRHE encoding with 'O' flag and 'D' flag set to 1:

      DTL = 001, OTL = 001, TU = '10', EXP = 2, DT = 0x22B, OT = 0x22A

6.  Deadline-6LoRHE in Three Network Scenarios

   In this section, Deadline-6LoRHE operation is described for 3 network
   scenarios.  Figure 4 depicts a constrained time-synchronized LLN that
   has two subnets N1 and N2, connected through LBRs
   [I-D.ietf-6lo-backbone-router] with different reference clock times

6.1.  Scenario 1: Endpoints in the same DODAG (N1)

   In scenario 1, shown in Figure 5, the Sender 'S' has an IP datagram
   to be routed to a Receiver 'R' within the same DODAG.  For the route
   segment from Sender to 6LBR, the Sender includes a Deadline-6LoRHE by
   encoding the deadline time contained in the packet.  Subsequently,
   each 6LR will perform hop-by-hop routing to forward the packet
   towards the 6LBR.  Once 6LBR receives the IP datagram, it sends the
   packet downstream towards 'R'.

   In case of a network running RPL non-storing mode, the 6LBR generates
   a IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulated packet when sending the packet downwards
   to the Receiver [I-D.ietf-roll-useofrplinfo].  The 6LBR copies the
   Deadline-6LoRHE from the Sender originated IP header to the outer IP
   header.  The Deadline-6LoRHE contained in the inner IP header is
   removed.

            Figure 5: End points within same DODAG (subnet N1)

   At the tunnel endpoint of the IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation, the
   Deadline-6LoRHE is copied back from the outer header to inner header,
   and the inner IP packet is delivered to 'R'.

6.2.  Scenario 2: Endpoints in Networks with Dissimilar L2 Technologies.

   In scenario 2, shown in Figure 6, the Sender 'S' (belonging to DODAG
   1) has IP datagram to be routed to a Receiver 'R' over a time-
   synchronized IPv6 network.  For the route segment from 'S' to 6LBR,
   'S' includes a Deadline-6LoRHE.  Subsequently, each 6LR will perform
   hop-by-hop routing to forward the packet towards the 6LBR.  Once the
   Deadline Time information reaches the border router, the packet will
   be encoded according to the mechanism prescribed in the other time-
   synchronized network depicted as "Time Synchronized Network" in the
   figure 6.  The specific data encapsulation mechanisms followed in the
   new network are beyond the scope of this document.

      Figure 6: Packet transmission in Dissimilar L2 Technologies or
                                 Internet

   For instance, the IP datagram could be routed to another time
   synchronized deterministic network using the mechanism specified in
   the In-band OAM [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data], and then the deadline time
   would be updated according to the measurement of the current time in
   the new network.

6.3.  Scenario 3: Packet transmission across different DODAGs (N1 to
      N2).

   Consider the scenario depicted in Figure 7, in which the Sender 'S'
   (belonging to DODAG 1) has an IP datagram to be sent to Receiver 'R'
   belonging to another DODAG (DODAG 2).  The operation of this scenario
   can be decomposed into combination of case 1 and case 2 scenarios.
   For the route segment from 'S' to 6LBR1, 'S' includes the Deadline-
   6LoRHE.  Subsequently, each 6LR will perform hop-by-hop operation to
   forward the packet towards the 6LBR1.  Once the IP datagram reaches
   6LBR1 of DODAG1, it applies the same rule as described in Case 2
   while routing the packet to 6LBR2 over a (likely) time synchronized
   wired backhaul.  The wired side of 6LBR2 can be mapped to receiver of
   Case 2.  Once the packet reaches 6LBR2, it updates the Deadline-
   6LoRHE by adding or subtracting the difference of time of DODAG2 and
   sends the packet downstream towards 'R'.

        Figure 7: Packet transmission in different DODAGs(N1 to N2)

   Consider an example of a 6TiSCH network in which S in DODAG1
   generates the packet at ASN 20000 to R in DODAG2.  Let the maximum
   allowable delay be 1 second.  The time-slot length in DODAG1 and
   DODAG2 is assumed to be 10ms.  Once the deadline time is encoded in
   Deadline-6LoRHE, the packet is forwarded to 6LBR of DODAG1.  Suppose
   the packet reaches 6LBR of DODAG1 at ASN 20030.

      current_time = ASN at LBR * slot_length_value

      remaining_time = deadline_time - current_time
      = ((packet_origination_time + max_delay) - current time)
      = (20000 + 100) - 20030
      = 30 (in Network ASNs)
      = 30 * 10^3 milliseconds.

   Once the Deadline Time information reaches the border router, the
   packet will be encoded accoding to the mechanism prescribed in the
   other time-synchronized network.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new Elective 6LoWPAN Routing Header Type, and
   IANA is requested to assign a value (TBD) from the 6LoWPAN Dispatch
   Page1 number space for this purpose.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC4944], [RFC6282] and [RFC6553]
   apply.  Using a compressed format as opposed to the full in-line
   format is logically equivalent and does not create an opening for a
   new threat when compared to [RFC6550], [RFC6553] and [RFC6554].
