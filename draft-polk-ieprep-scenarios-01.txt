This memo conveys simplistically the likely topological scenarios that may 
be encountered in reference to IEPREP phone calls.  These scenarios should 
be used to focus the IEPREP Working Group during discussions and when 
writing requirements, gap analysis and other solutions documents.

1.0	Introduction

This memo conveys simplistically the likely topological scenarios that may 
be encountered in reference to IEPREP phone calls.  These scenarios should 
be used to focus the IEPREP Working Group during discussions and when 
writing requirements, gap analysis and other solutions documents.

There has been much confusion on the IEPREP list as well as within each 
meeting about the topologies IEPREP is considering. Hopefully this 
document will give each reader and author a reference set of named 
architectures.

This memo attempts to be agnostic with regard to IP signaling or control 
protocols (SIP, MEGACO, etc), as well as any underlying QOS mechanisms 
(Diffserv, RSVP, NSIS, etc).


1.1 Motivation

Simply put, to get everyone referencing the same (named) topologies in 
order to have useful and less confusing dialog to further this working
group's efforts.


1.2 Changes from -00 version 

This version greatly reduces the text of the overall document by removing 
all discussion of requirements and authentication & authorization. This is 
not a requirements document (therefore shouldn't state any), and the A&A 
text/discussion for each of the topologies, though necessary within the

WG, has been moved to another "ieprep-topology-implications" document.


1.3 Terms and Definitions

The following acronyms need to be exploded for clarity:

      CSN = Circuit Switched Network

      GW  = Gateway (CSN to IP, or IP to CSN)


2.0 IEPREP Topologies

There are 4 often mentioned, but very little documented topologies 
discussed within this WG's efforts so far. The following subsections name 
and describe each of the topologies. 

The 4 topologies are (quickly):

     Topology "IP Bridging"

     Topology "IP at the Start"

     Topology "IP at the End"

     Topology "End-to-End IP"


2.1 Topology "IP Bridging"

This topology is sometimes known as "IP in the Middle" of two CSNs. In 
this topology, a CSN phone of any type initiates (dials) a call (session) 
to another CSN phone with an IP core between the two CSNs. 

This topology should simplistically look like this:

                                                                          
   Circuit                      Internet                    Circuit       
   Switched         IP            or              IP        Switched      
   Network        Ingress      IP Segment       Egress      Network       
  -----------+              +--------------+              +-----------    
             |    +----+    |     IP       |    +----+    |               
     CSN     |    |    |    |              |    |    |    |     CSN       
    Phone ------->| GW |----------------------->| GW |-------->Phone      
             |    |    |    |              |    |    |    |               
             |    +----+    |              |    +----+    |               
  -----------+              +--------------+              +-----------

2.2 Topology "IP at the Start"

This topology has the initiating party placing (dialing) the call from an 
IP Phone (PDA or computer), and the called party residing in the CSN. 

                                                                          
                Internet                             Circuit              
                   or                  CSN           Switched             
               IP Segment            Ingress         Network              
           -------------------+                 +---------------          
                              |       +----+    |                         
              IP              |       |    |    |     CSN                 
             Phone ------------------>| GW |--------> Phone               
                              |       |    |    |                         
                              |       +----+    |                         
           -------------------+                 +---------------          
                                                                          
              Figure 2. Topology "IP at the Start"


One key aspect of this topology is where the intelligence is for any 
prioritization of call/session handling. Initially, it cannot be assumed 
that the CSN Ingress GW is ETS or priority-aware. 


2.3 Topology "IP at the End"

This topology has the calling party placing the call from a CSN phone, and 
the called party being in an IP network. 

                                                                          
             Circuit                               Internet               
             Switched                  CSN            or                  
             Network                  Egress       IP Segment             
           -------------------+                 +---------------          
                              |       +----+    |                         
              CSN             |       |    |    |      IP                 
             Phone ------------------>| GW |--------> Phone               
                              |       |    |    |                         
                              |       +----+    |                         
           -------------------+                 +---------------

2.4 Topology "End-to-End IP"

This topology has no circuit switched sections in the call path.
