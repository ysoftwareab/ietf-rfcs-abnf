1. Introduction

   Ethernet over coaxial (EoC)provides a cost-effective way for
   Internet service providers to ensure a high quality Internetaccess
   for their subscribers with hybrid fiber coaxial network, while
   accelerating the deployment of digital video service and the ability
   to connect multiple devicesto the same coaxial cable.

   For managing and controlling such an access network, a network
   operator will prefer to have a unified scheduling, management, and
   quality-of-service (QoS) environment that includes coaxial portions
   of the hybrid fiber coaxial network. This can be achieved by
   designing the Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)[1]
   functionalities, and by having a centralized OAM framework from the
   cable head-end to the end-users' premises.

   The document defines a reference model and associated protocol that
   introduces requirements on an EoC system to support the
   configuration and transport of a class of service between a coax
   line terminal(CLT) and the coax network unit(CNU).

3. Network OAM Framework

   The OAM reference architecture, as shown in figure 1,identifies the
   elements that an EoC network minimally requires to perform and
   communicate properly between the functional subsystems of the EoC
   system.

   According to the need for service and device management in EoC
   system, the OAM framework includes:

   o EoC functionality Management
      Functionality management is a common tool for setting the
      parameters of Ethernet signal over coaxial, e.g. radio frequency
      and modulation.

   o Service Management
      Service management is responsible for setting Ethernet profiles,
      e.g. VLAN, multicast, frame filtering, bandwidth, QoS, broadcast
      flood, UNI port.

   o Performance Management
      Performance management is a key tool that allows users to
      discover the performance of CLT port, CNU port and UNI by
      measuring the metrics of Ethernet service and RF.

   o Failure Management
      Failure management supports detecting and monitoring the state of
      CLT and CNU continuously or at intervals. If failure occurs, it
      will result in warning, or loopback detection, etc.

   o Security Management
      Security management defines the security measures for accessing
      CNU, e.g. user and password authentication, privilege
      authorization, and key management.

   o System Management
      System management describes the functionalities of software and
      hardware maintenance, e.g. CNU remote boot, firmware update.

4. Reference Model for Interoperability

   In the EoC system, the interoperability model includes basic
   functionality interoperability and service interoperability.

4.1. Basic Functionality Interoperability

   The basic functionality, which is specify by various EoC standards,
   such as IEEE 1901-2010 [3], refers to the interoperability of
   physical layer and the MAC layer implementation from different
   manufacturers between CLT and CNU Ethernet services. The physical
   layer interoperability includes the consistency of working frequency
   and the modulation parameters of CLT and CNU. The MAC layer
   interoperability includes the mechanism of CSMA / CA, TDMA, and
   clock synchronization between CLT and CNU.

4.2. Service Interoperability

   Service interoperability refers to the ability of proper service
   operation and management between different CLT and CNU vendors. The
   consistency includes user port related operation at terminals,
   multicast operations, VLAN operations, QoS-related operations,
   bandwidth-limiting operations. In addition, service interoperability
   also includes all the management operations associated with the EoC
   basic functionality (mainly the EoC system configuration and
   management), as well as partially the service carrying operations
   (mainly the configuration of service carrying).

   Other management operations other than the specifiedabove,can be
   defined as well, but it's not in the scope of this document.

5. Protocol for Interoperability

   The service interoperability of EoC system includes two aspects: 1)
   protocol for interaction between CLT and CNU, which is implemented
   via the management message exchange; 2) an Interoperability
   Management Module(IMM) at CNU, which handles management message and
   transforms the message into specific format. For conventional CNU,
   the IMM need transform Management Message Entity(MME)into MDIO
   signals for layer 2 switching. For CNU with home gateway functions,
   IMM just forwards the MME to gateway transparently.

   The protocol for service interoperability defines the procedure for
   setting / reading the profile attributes, handling OAM requests and
   responses, and performing version management.

   The CNU which works as a home gateway, implements the management
   functionalities by forwarding messages via Interoperability
   Management Module. For the extended MME destined for home gateway,
   Interoperability Management Module change the destination MAC
   address as the MAC address of the home gateway, and forwards it to
   home gateway. For the extended MME destined for CLT,
   Interoperability Management Module change the destination MAC
   address as the MAC address of EoC module, and forwarded it to CLT.

               Figure 2 Interoperability between CLT and CNU

   The typical interaction between the CLT and CNU can be illustrated
   using an example. After CNU gets online, the configuration
   management is performed by BOSS and NMS automatically through the
   management channel. The procedure works as follows.

   1. After CNU start, Interoperability Management Module reads the
      functional attributes of CNU;

   2. CNU Interoperability Management Module registers extended MME at
      EoC module. After the registration, all registered extended MME
      will be forwarded to Interoperability Management Module for
      processing.

   3. After receiving online message from CNU, CLT sends the extended
      MME to query the attribute the CNU.

   1. Interoperability Management Module reply the attributes,
      including the MAC address of the home gateway using extended MME.

   2. CLT sends the CNU's online authentication information to NMS. The
      authentication information includes the MAC addresses of EoC
      module and the home gateway.

Internet-Draft       Reference Model for EoC OAM         November 2014


   3. NMS and BOSS handle CNU authentication. If authenticated, the
      VLAN and IP information (Note: Including the subnet mask, IP
      gateway, ACS URL, DNS IP) will be sent to CLT using configuration
      profile.

   4. After the receipt of the configuration profile, CLT first parses
      the configuration parameters and encapsulates the parameters of
      home gateway with extend MME, and then send it to CNU. If CLT
      does not receive any profile, it will send CNU online
      authentication information to the NMS periodically.

   5. After Interoperability Management Module received extended MME,
      it will set the destination as the MAC address of home gateway,
      and the source as the MAC address of EoC module. Then it sends
      the modified MME to the home gateway.

   6. Upon receiving the extended MME, the home gateway will configure
      its VLAN IP information (Note: Including the subnet mask, IP
      gateways, ACS URL, DNS IP) and sends the results back to CLT.

   7. After received the MME from home gateway, Interoperability
      Management Module will set the source of the extended MME as the
      EoC MAC address.

   8. After CLT received home gateway's MME on its successful
      configuration, it will establish the relationship between the
      home gateway and CNU locally. The configuration information of
      home gateway will be stored as well.

   9. Home gateway will establish TR069 connection with ACS after it
      received the configuration management profile of VLAN and IP(note:
      including the subnet mask, IP gateway, ACS URL).

   Other OAM operations can be illustrated in a similar way. The
   interaction between CLT and CNU extended MME message.

6. Security Considerations

   This document discusses a reference model for implementing OAM in
   Ethernet over Coaxial access network. The solution to some of the
   problems discussed can have security implications, such as when a
   malicious client's attack on a protocol can create a false illusion
   of failures, or prevent the detection of actual ones.

   Malicious client should not be able to use non-EoC interfaces to
   insert EoC-specific OAM transactions. Providing a secure mechanism
   for EoC OAM is required if EoC-specific protocols are to be used

   successfully. Therefore, authentication and authorization for OAM
   MUST be considered when designing OAM-related mechanisms, which
   satisfy the reference model presented in this document.

7. IANA Considerations

   This memo does not have any IANA considerations.
