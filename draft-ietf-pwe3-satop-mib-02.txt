1. Introduction


   This document describes a model for managing encapsulated Structure-
   Agnostic TDM signals for transmission over a Packet Switched Network
   (PSN)[SATOP].


   SAToP is currently specified to carry the TDM bit-streams disregard
   any structure that may be imposed on these streams, in particular the
   structure imposed by the standard TDM framing [G.704]


   The module for managing a PW service is composed of three to five
   layers of MIB modules functioning all together.  This general model
   is described in the PWE3 Architecture [FWARCH]and in PWTDMMIB].  The
   layering model is intended to sufficiently isolate PW services from
   the underlying PSN layer that carries the emulated service.  This is
   done at the same time as providing a standard means for connecting
   any supported services to any supported PSNs.


   The model for managing SAToP at its upper layers consists of
   combination of the MIB modules described in [DS1MIB], [DS3MIB],
   [TDMMIB],[PWMIB] and the textual conventions defined in [PWTC].


   The top layer contains the technology-specific management objects,
   that exist in  MIB modules for the native service such as [DS1MIB]
   and [DS3MIB].


   The next layer down is the PW  service-specific modules such as the
   one defined in this document and in [PWTDMMIB].  This layer by itself
   might consists of one or more MIB modules depending on the specific
   technology in use.


   The next layer is the Generic PW MIB [PWMIB].  This module is used to
   configure general parameters of PWs that are common to all types of
   emulated services and PSNs.  This layer is connected to the service-
   specific layer above, and the PSN layer below.

3. Terminology


   SAToP terminology used in this document is taken from the [SATOP]
   draft that describes a mechanism for transporting Structure-Agnostic




Nicklass                Expires January 16, 2005                [Page 3]
Internet-Draft          Managed Objects for SAToP              July 2004



   (TDM) bit-streams over a packet-oriented network.  The mechanism
   encapsulates TDM bit-streams (T1, E1, T3, E3) as pseudo-wires over a
   packet-oriented network.  This emulation is referred to as "emulation
   of unstructured TDM circuits" in [PWTDMREQ] and suits applications
   where the PEs have no need to interpret TDM data or to participate in
   the TDM signaling.


   "PSN-bound" references the traffic direction where TDM data is
   received, adapted to packet based on number of payload bytes per
   packet, assigned a SAToP header (Sequence numbers, flags, and
   timestamps (if the RTP header is used)), prepended multiplexing layer
   and PSN headers and sent into the PSN.


   Conversely, The "CE-bound" references the traffic direction where
   packets are received from the PSN, packet payloads are reassembled by
   including a jitter buffer where payload of the received SAToP packets
   is stored prior to play-out to the TDM line.  The size of this buffer
   SHOULD be locally configurable to allow accommodation to the PSN-
   specific packet delay variation.


   The CE-bound SAToP IWF SHOULD use the sequence number in the control
   word for detection of lost and mis-ordered packets.  If the RTP
   header is used, the RTP sequence numbers MAY be used for the same
   purposes.


4. The Internet-Standard Management Framework


   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].


   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


5. Overview


   This MIB module is designed to satisfy the following requirements and
   constraints:


   1.  Fits within the architecture defined in [PWMIB], [PWARCH].


   2.  The MIB module supports edge-to-edge emulation of Structure-




Nicklass                Expires January 16, 2005                [Page 4]
Internet-Draft          Managed Objects for SAToP              July 2004



       Agnostic TDM bit-stream connections.


   3.  The MIB module configures the connection and its relevant
       behavior.


   4.  The MIB module reports various alarms, counters and status
       objects.


   5.  The PSN specific objects are defined in other documents.



6. SAToP MIB module usage


6.1 Structure of SAToP MIB


   The SAToP PW Configuration Parameter Table (pwVcSatopCfgTable) has
   objects for PW connection characteristics.  In situations where sets
   of objects are common amongst few PW connections, a single entry may
   be referenced by many PW connection entries in pwVcTDMTable
   [PWTDMMIB].


6.2 SAToP Connection configuration Procedure


   Configuring a SAToP PW involves the following steps:


   First Configure the interface layer parameters using DS1-MIB and or
   DS3-MIB.


   Next, create an entry in the pwVcTable and configure the PSN tunnels:


   - Follow steps as defined in [PWMIB].


   NOTE: The agent should create an entry in the pwVcTDMTable [PWTDM]for
   any entry created in the pwVcTable with pwVcType equal one of the
   following values:


   o  17   Structure-agnostic E1 over Packet


   o  18   Structure-agnostic T1 (DS1) over Packet


   o  19   Structure-agnostic E3 over Packet


   o  20   Structure-agnostic T3 (DS3) over Packet


   Next complete the SAToP PW configuration:


   - If necessary, create an entry in the pwVcSatopCfgTable (a suitable
   entry may already exist).




Nicklass                Expires January 16, 2005                [Page 5]
Internet-Draft          Managed Objects for SAToP              July 2004



   - Set the index of this pwVcSatopCfgTable entry in the pwVcTDMTable
   [PWTDMMIB].


6.3 SAToP PW Monitoring


   Upon making the SAToP PW operational, the pwVcTDMPerfCurrentTable,
   pwVcTDMPerfIntervalTable, and pwVcTDMPerfTable [PWTDMMIB]can be used
   to monitor the various counters, indicators, and conditions of the
   PW.


6.4 Example of actual SAToP PW Setup


   This section provides an example of using the various MIB objects
   described in Figure 1 below to set up a SAToP PW connection of DS1
   type.  While this example is not meant to illustrate all options of
   the MIB, it is intended as an aid to understanding some of the key
   concepts.  See [PWMIB] for an example of setting up PSN Tunnels.


   1.  configure the DS1 interface [DS1MIB].


   2.  Get a new pwVcIndexNext [PWMIB] and create a new pwVcTable
       [PWMIB] entry using the value of pwVcIndexNext (assume here, the
       PW index = 20).


   3.  Set the pwVcType [PWMIB] of the new entry to (18) 'Structure-
       agnostic T1 (DS1) over Packet'.  This should create a new entry
       in the pwVcTDMTable [PWTDMMIB].


   4.  If needed, create an entry in the pwVcTDMCfgTable.  Verify that
       there are no error in the configuration using the relevant
       object.


   5.  If needed, create an entry in the pwVcSatopCfgTable.  Verify that
       there are no error in the configuration using the relevant
       object.


   6.  Configure the newly created TDM PW with the required pointers,
       indices and the relevant entry in pwVcTDMCfgTable and in
       pwVcSatopCfgTable (assuming 13 and 10 respectively).


   In [DS1MIB] dsx1IfIndex             = 4


   In [PWMIB]  pwVcIndex               = 20


   In [PWTDMMIB] pwVcTDMTable, has a corresponding index of 20.

Internet-Draft          Managed Objects for SAToP              July 2004



        Figure 1: An entry in pwVcSatopCfgTable



   In pwVcSatopCfgTable create a new entry(index = 10):
   {
     pwVcSatopCfgConsecPktLoss2Normal     = 3  -- Exit  LOPS state
     pwVcSatopCfgConsecMissPktNorma2Loss  = 5  -- Enter LOPS state
     ...
     pwVcSatopCfgPktReplacePolicy         = allOnes(1)
     ...
     pwVcSatopCfgMissingPktsToSes         = 3  -- packets,


     pwVcSatopCfgRowStatus                = createAndGo
   }


   Check that there are no error bits set in pwVcSatopCfgConfigError.


   Complete the pwVcTDMTable with:



   {
     pwVcTDMIfIndex             = 4    -- IfIndex of associated DS1 entry


     pwVcGenTDMCfgIndex         = 13   -- Index of associated entry
                                       -- in pwVcTDMCfgTable.
     pwVcTDMCfgIndex            = 10   -- Index of associated entry
                                       -- in pwVcSatopCfgTable (above).
   }


   Check that there are no error bits set in pwVcTDMConfigError
   [PWTDMMIB].


   It is important to note that such configuration reflects one end
   point of PW connection.  In order to have the connection well
   operating, both end points should have compatible configuration, each
   within its own device.

8. Security considerations


   It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for monitoring
   of SAToP PWs.  This MIB can also be used for configuration of certain
   objects, and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly
   configured, with potentially disastrous results.


   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:


   The pwVcSatopCfgTable contains objects of SAToP PW parameters on a
   Provider Edge (PE) device.  Unauthorized access to objects in these
   tables could result in disruption of traffic on the network.


   The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be
   considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be
   used with any SNMPV3 agent, which implements this MIB module.
   Administrators should consider whether read access to these objects
   should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable under certain
   circumstances.


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module "i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible" may be considered sensitive or




Nicklass                Expires January 16, 2005               [Page 16]
Internet-Draft          Managed Objects for SAToP              July 2004



   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.


   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec",
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the objects
   in this MIB module.


   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8",
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for
   authentication and privacy".


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals "users" that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them.


9. IANA considerations


   As requested in the PW TC MIB [PWTC], PWE3 related standards track
   MIB modules should be rooted under the pwStdMIB subtree.  The IANA is
   requested to assign { pwStdMIB 6 } to the PW SAToP MIB module
   specified in this document.
