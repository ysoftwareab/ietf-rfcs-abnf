Abstract

   While the wide use of IPv4 "private" addresses [RFC1918] lead to a
   great flexibilty degree of uninterconnected networks and use of IPv6
   offer a huge address space; no "nice" mechanism exist to hide overlap
   of existing IPv4 "private" networks if and when the sum of used
   address spaces is greater than the IPv4 "private" address space.
   This document specifies how to walk around the matter without any
   coordination, renumbering or IPv6 adoption by overlapping networks
   owners.

1.  Introduction

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [RFC2119]

   Users of IPv4 "private" addresses often delegate management of some
   of their hosts to External Company(s) (EC) through "ad hoc"
   communication links and can't migrate them to IPv6 in short terms;
   but management hosts in such EC need to communicate with all of
   managed networks/hosts, even if their addresses are not unique for
   it's point of view.

   In simple cases Network Address Translation (NAT) is sufficient to
   hide such overlaps, but there is a limit: when the sum of used
   address spaces is greater than the whole IPv4 "private" address
   space the NAT mechanism need more addresses than the available ones.

   Port Address Translation (PAT) is another way to do job: it works,
   but will soon become a nightmare to mantain the associations in
   dinamically growing networks.  As long as many globally-overlapping
   addreses can be hidden by a small pool of globally-unique in a nice
   fashion when the pool of globally-overlapping host is "client" of
   globally-unique "server" host(s), it is an always-growing-matter to
   add/remove networks into the global map when the overlapping IPv4
   "private" networks are both sources and targets of management-hosts
   traffic flows because it requires interactive cooperation of
   globally-overlapping network owners with the EC.

   Another simple, horribly unscalable solution is to add devices owned
   by the EC into existing networks: they have just as much topology
   knowledge as needed, but in time of troubles they can't access or be
   accessed by the "full resources" of the EC.

Internet-Draft       IPv4 Multiplexing through IPv6            July 2009

   This document provides specifications for a mechanism that saves both
   indipendence of each customer in choosing their own host addressing
   skema than global-host-reachability for the EC that manage them.



2.  Specifications


2.1. Address specifications

   Given the following definitions [RFC4291] of :

   IPv4-Compatible IPv6 Address

   |                80 bits               | 16 |      32 bits        |
   +--------------------------------------+--------------------------+
   |0000..............................0000|0000|    IPv4 address     |
   +--------------------------------------+----+---------------------+

   and

   IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address

   |                80 bits               | 16 |      32 bits        |
   +--------------------------------------+--------------------------+
   |0000..............................0000|FFFF|    IPv4 address     |
   +--------------------------------------+----+---------------------+

   The 16 bit block can be used to differentiate networks in which 32
   bit IPv4 addresses are identical, leading to definition of :

   IPv4-Multiplexed IPv6 Address

   |                80 bits               | 16 |      32 bits        |
   +--------------------------------------+--------------------------+
   |0000..............................0000|CNID|    IPv4 address     |
   +--------------------------------------+----+---------------------+

   where Customer Network ID (CNID) ranges between 0x1 and 0xFFFE thus
   allowing coexistence of 65534 address spaces as wide as the IPv4
   InterNet.

2.2. Communication skema

   Assigning souch a CNID to every customer overlapping network removes
   ambiguity of IPv4 addresses; an IPv6 host (H6) placed in EC network 
   can now send/receive a packet to/from any of IPv4 hosts (H4) in any
   of multiplexed network, given an IPv6-to-IPv6 NAT capable gateway 
   (GW66) for each used CNID.
   While dual-stack routers (GW64) are able to traslate addresses
   between IPv4 and IPv6, the problem reduces to change CNID before
   ingress and after egress of them as in:

           (a)                 (b)               (c)
   H6 <-----------> GW66 <------------> GW64 <----------> H4
   -------------- IPv6 --- (No CNID) ----|------- IPv4 -----

   where IPv6 is used in segments (a), (b) and IPv4 in segment (c).
   Segment (a) has 0 < CNID < 65535; segment (b) has 0x0 or 0xFFFF.

   Because "IPv4-Compatible IPv6 Address" are deprecated [RFC4291] them
   MAY be used, but "IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address" are RECOMMENDED.

   There is a drawback : no IPv6-to-IPv6 NAT-capable gateways exists,
   so we need at least a simple one that force all CNID bits to zeroes
   (for IPv4-Compatible IPv6 Address) or ones (for IPv4-Mapped IPv6
   Address) before a packet leaves the interface connected to GW64 and
   force them to CNID before release of packet to H6 as in :


   | sender |   source address    |  destination address  | receiver |
   +--------+---------------------+-----------------------+----------+
   |  H6    | IPv6 global-unicast | IPv4-Multiplexed IPv6 |   GW66   |
   +--------+---------------------+-----------------------+----------+
   |  GW66  | IPv6 global-unicast |   IPv4-Mapped IPv6    |   GW64   |
   +--------+---------------------+-----------------------+----------+
   |  GW64  |         IPv4        |        IPv4           |    H4    |
   +--------+---------------------+-----------------------+----------+

   and

   | sender |     source address    | destination address | receiver |
   +--------+-----------------------+---------------------+----------+
   |  H4    |        IPv4           |       IPv4          |   GW64   |
   +--------+-----------------------+---------------------+----------+
   |  GW64  |   IPv4-Mapped IPv6    | IPv6 global-unicast |   GW66   |
   +--------+-----------------------+---------------------+----------+
   |  GW66  | IPv4-Multiplexed IPv6 | IPv6 global-unicast |    H6    |
   +--------+-----------------------+---------------------+----------+

2.3. CNID structure

   The 16 bit CNID can be used as a flat space or structured one, at
   EC network-manager will; the following skema is both simple and 
   flexible and SHOULD be considered as default :

   ::0000:IPv4-address == IPv4-Compatible IPv6 Addres
   ::0001:IPv4-address ==> CNID 0x1 identifies "customer-1"
     ......
   ::7FFF:IPv4-address ==> CNID 0x7FFF identifies "customer-32767"
   ::8000:IPv4-address ==> first "special pourposes" CNID
     .....
   ::FFFE:IPv4-address ==> last "special pourposes" CNID
   ::FFFF:IPv4-address ==> IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address

   In a flat CNID space "special pourposes" are simply casted to be
   equal to "normal" ones; subspacing of "special pourposes" can be
   easily done as needed using more bits than the most significant one.


2.4. Routing considerations

   The H6(s) MUST know a different gateway for each customer address
   space to avoid complexity in IPv6-to-IPv6 NAT; in such a way GW66
   need to be aware of just a default route on it's "internal" interface
   (the one belonging to management network) and a specific route for
   ::0/96 on "external", the one connected to customer GW64.

   But complexity exist and can't be circumvented in a scalable solution
   [RFC1925].  Whenever the routing table of H6s become complex MAY be
   convenient the introduction of a router between H6s and GW66s to
   isolate complexity in one device instead to spread it in all H6s.
   It is almost equal to have a "complex" IPv6-to-IPv6 NAT device, but
   it delegate the routing configuration/maintenance to independent,
   well known, more than ever powerful and failsafe devices: routers.

   Note that there is no need of different hardware but only of
   different (sub)interfaces for GW66s.  Moreover: no need of separate
   hardware also for the intermediate router between H6s and GW66s,
   different instances of software can do the job.

   At GW64 there are no particular need, except the ability to perform
   IPv4/IPv6 translation, so it MUST be a so-called dual-stack router.
   Because H4s will send/receive packets from/to that device(s) on 
   behalf of H6s, we need, at least, as many IPv4 "private" addresses
   as the number of reachable-H6s; much better an addresses pool as
   wide as the H6s network, 1:1 NAT is more easily-manageable in
   allocation of addresses.

   H4(s) are supposed to "see" H6(s) as they are H4(s), so no particular
   need at their charge, except the ability to communicate with GW64(s).

3.  Security considerations

   The author do not believe that introduction of IPv6-to-IPv6 NAT can
   cause problems or weakness nor increase the overall security; the
   IPv6 global-unicast addresses used in IPv6 segments are
   undistiguishable from any other IPv6 global-unicast address.


4.   IANA Considerations

   Values from 0x0001 to 0xfffe in bits 81-96 of an IPv6 address are
   reserved for IPv4 adresses multiplexing.
