INTERNET DRAFT      Inter-Cloud DDoS Mitigation API     October 19, 2015


1. Introduction

   The recent growth in volume and scale of Distributed Denial of
   Service (DDoS) attacks, particularly its impact on the large pipes of
   Inter-Cloud, Inter-Provider connections, calls for mechanisms to
   enable DDoS mitigation across Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and
   Network Service Providers (NSPs). These mechanisms require to define
   an Inter-Cloud DDoS Mitigation Abstract Layer with corresponding
   standardized APIs to allow real time, automated information exchange
   among CSPs and NSPs, and achieve rapid protective response and
   effective Inter Cloud/Inter Provider DDoS attack mitigation. The need
   for such standard Inter-Cloud DDoS Mitigation APIs is strong and
   urgent.

   This document defines the Inter-Cloud DDoS Mitigation Abstract Layer
   and APIs. 

   This document focuses on Inter-Cloud, Inter-Provider automated
   exchange of DDoS Mitigation information, although similar APIs could
   be used within each cloud for handling malicious traffic.

1.1. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology defined in
   [I-D.draft-hares-i2nsf-use-case-gap-analysis].

   In addition, this document uses the following terms.

2. Problem Statement

   Along with the rapid growth of cloud services, the large pipes of
   Inter-Cloud, Inter-Provider connections are increasingly the subject
   of DDoS attacks. Since these connections are between clouds of
   different providers, implementing mechanism to achieve rapid
   protective response in case of attack is challenging. While within
   its own cloud each provider may be able to protect effectively its
   network using various DDoS protection techniques, for the Inter-
   Cloud/Inter-Provider links, each provider does not have full
   visibility of the attack, and therefore response times may be longer,
   counter-measures may be less effective, and therefore the severity
   and impact of the attacks may be very significant. 

   Large DDoS attacks targeting the Inter-Cloud, Inter-Provider links
   may consume the available bandwidth or the router/switch/server
   resources within tens of seconds. While the attack is on, legitimate
   traffic is prevented from being forwarded over the saturated links.
   With saturated Inter-Cloud, Inter-Provider links, even if within each
   cloud the DDoS mitigation may be working effectively, it can quickly
   be rendered irrelevant. 

   Today, exchange of DDoS attack information and mitigation strategy
   among providers is largely manual and typically relies on customized
   operation processes established ad hoc between each provider. Because
   of largely manual escalation procedures, providers' reaction times to
   DDoS attacks to Inter-Cloud, Inter-Provider links tends to be slow
   (it can easily take tens of minutes if not hours to put effective
   mitigation measures in place) compared to Intra-Cloud DDoS
   mitigation, and thus the damage caused by such attacks can be
   substantial. The reaction time may exceed the Disruption Life Cycle
   (DLC) of the attack.

   Sophisticated and determined malicious attackers are able to quickly
   learn the intended Inter-Cloud Inter-Provider link capabilities and
   limitations through probing. This includes bandwidth capacity,
   saturation resistance, and DDoS absorption resilience of the link.
   The attacker is also able to learn the DDoS countermeasures and their
   response times, from which the attacker can infer the DLC that can be
   exacted toward the intended target. The DLC is measured by the
   assailant from the time the attack is initiated to the time the
   mitigation response becomes evident. An attacker can then use this
   information to design the attacks in such a way that the current and
   subsequent attacks inflict the most harm.

   In order to achieve rapid protective response, the exchange of DDoS
   mitigation information between providers must be enabled in real time
   and in an automated, standardized fashion.

          Figure 1. Inter-Cloud DDoS Mitigation Abstract Layer and APIs.

   Today there is no accepted industry common DDoS Mitigation Layer that
   can be used to reduce the reaction time and increase the
   effectiveness of mitigation in case of attack. 

   The Inter-Cloud DDoS Mitigation Abstract Layer provides standardized
   secure APIs that can be used by each provider to programmatically
   initiate real time information exchanges to other providers to
   provide visibility of the attack and coordinate DDoS mitigation
