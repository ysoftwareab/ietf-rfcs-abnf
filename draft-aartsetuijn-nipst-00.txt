Abstract

   This document describes a SIP-based method for network initiated
   partial session transfers that works together with terminal initiated
   partial session transfers.  It uses the Mobile Node Control Mode for
   terminal initiated partial session transfers and it extends this
   method to support network initiated partial session transfers.

2.  Introduction

   As work in progress [shacham06] described, SIP Session Mobility is
   the seamless transfer of media of an ongoing communication session
   from one device to another.  A system for session mobility is
   defined, aimed at allowing a Mobile Node (MN) to discover available
   nodes and to include them in an active session. [shacham06] also
   defines how the different parts of a session can be individually
   transferred to these devices, meaning the different stream endpoints
   in a multimedia-stream can each be transferred to another device,
   here called partial session mobility.  Two methods are proposed, the
   Session Handoff mode and the Mobile Node Control Mode.

   With both these methods the Mobile Node (The mobile terminal used by
   the user) initiates the partial session transfer.  This document
   describes how a partial session transfer can be initiated from a
   dedicated node located in the network such that Mobile Node initiated
   partial session transfers are still possible based on de described
   method in [aartsetuijn06] and the work in progress [shacham06].
   Network initiated partial session transfers would typically be
   triggered by external events like network-side discovery of nearby
   multimedia devices like beamers.

   When the dedicated node in the network initiates a partial session
   transfers, the user may want to be involved in the decision;
   therefore the partial session transfer is proposed to the user-
   terminal to let the user decide about the actual execution of the
   partial session transfer.  The following information is assumed to be
   necessary for the user decision:

   o  Which media-stream endpoint will be transferred

   o  The device to transfer the stream endpoint to

   o  The media-parameters to be used for the media-stream after the
      transfer

   As described in [aartsetuijn06] the most applicable solution to base
   network initiated partial session mobility on is the Mobile Node
   Control Mode.

   Mechanisms for session transfer between a terminal's IP and circuit
   voice interface are specified in the 3GPP voice call continuity (VCC)
   standards [3GPP 23.279].  Contrary to this, the partial session
   mobility procedure described here targets usage of multiple SIP-
   enabled devices at each endpoint of a SIP session and the decision
   for suggesting partial session transfer comes from a (network) node
   that perceives which devices close to the SIP session endpoint can

3.  Overview of operation

   This section describes the operation of network initiated partial
   session mobility; the Mobile Node initiated partial session transfers
   are assumed to be handled with the Mobile Node Control Mode as
   described in [shacham06].

3.1.  Key concepts

   The Mobile Node Control Mode uses the capabilities of SDP [RFC4566]
   to transfer media-stream endpoints to different devices.  Since the
   media-stream endpoints are controlled solely on the control plane,
   network initiated partial session mobility can be supported entirely
   on the control plane, while the actual media-streams are set up
   directly between the devices.

   A network node supporting network initiated partial session mobility
   should be part of all the session-specific SIP signalling of the
   nodes that want to use the service.  This means the node can alter/
   change and setup sessions on behalve of the involved nodes.  A new
   session will be set up by the dedicated node in the network if it
   involves a new device to handle one or more media-streams.  The
   sessions with other devices that help the Mobile Node (MN) handle
   media-streams are called sub-sessions

   A mobility session is defined as a session of a Mobile Node with is
   peer in a session, and the sub-sessions between the Mobile Node and
   the additional devices that are used in the session with the peer.

   Another important concept being used is using a proposal to let the
   user decide about the execution of a network initiated partial
   session transfer.  This means the dedicated node located in the
   network must first propose a partial session transfer to the user or
   user-terminal, after which it is only executed if the user agrees
   with the proposed transfer.

3.2.  Component overview

   The network node to initiate partial session mobility is called the
   sub-session controller (SSC); it acts as a SIP B2BUA.  In IMS [3GPP
   23.228] this would typically be implemented as an application server.

   The SSC can offer its service to each individual node on each
   individual session that has the SSC in its signalling path.  In this
   document the MN is the user-terminal that the SSC is offering its
   service to.  The MN does have an ongoing session with a corresponding
   node (CN).  To accomodate the user-terminal other devices can be used
   as endpoint for the involved media-streams, these devices are called

   local nodes (LNs).  Examples of LNs are an audio node (AN) that can
   play and record audio and a video node (VN) that can play and record
   video.  Ofcourse LNs can also act only as source or target for media-
   streams.

   In case the CN also wants to use partial session mobility itself, it
   will play the role of MN in its own mobility session.  This means a
   session between two devices can be represented by two mobility
   sessions, each of which contains the session between the two devices,
   but with each of the devices in another role.

3.3.  Network initiated partial session transfer

   Before a partial session transfer can be initiated a session must
   exist.  The SSC is located in the signalling path of this session,
   and it acts as a B2BUA.  Figure 1 shows the message sequence diagram
   of a typical network initiated partial session transfer.  Below this
   message sequence diagram is explained in more detail.

   To propose the partial session transfer to the user the SSC sends an
   INVITE message (1) to the MN.  This message uses the option-tag 'pst-
   control' in the Required header field to make sure the MN can
   interpet the message correctly.  If the MN does not accept the
   proposal it responses with 603 (Decline), as shown in Figure 2 ,
   message (2).  In that case the SSC should not proceed with the
   partial session transfer.

   As described in Section 2 it is assumed the MN need to know which
   media stream will be transferred, to which device it will be
   transferred, and with which media-parameters.  To show to what device
   the media-stream will be transferred, a new header field is
   introduced for INVITE messages, namely the Pst-to header field.  This
   header field contains the SIP-URI of the device the media-stream will
   be transferred to.

   To inform the MN about which media-stream will be transferred and
   with what media-parameters, the INVITE message meant as proposal
   contains a SDP-body.  This SDP-body contains a session description
   proposal that will be sent to the CN when re-invited.  By analyzing
   this session description and comparing it with the previous session
   description being offered to the CN, it knows which media-stream is
   being transferred, and what media-parameters will be used.  Figure 4
   contains an example of the SDP-proposal sent to the MN; the MN
   compares it to the last SDP session description it sent to the CN,
   shown in Figure 3.  The MN can determine which media-stream will be
   transferred by looking at the Connection parameter; the media-stream
   that is being transferred uses another connection parameter.

   A new header field is added to the SIP INVITE message to inform the
   MN about the Call-id of the sub-session that will be set up with the
   target device of the transfer.  The header containing this Call-id is
   called Pst-call-id.

   SSC might know all capabilities in advance, so it can invite the LD
   and CN more precisely.  If it does not, it invites the LN without any
   SDP.

   The order in which the involved nodes are invited is important to the

   compatibility with SIPUAs.  To make sure as much SIPUAs are supported
   as possible old media-streams first has to be stopped before new
   media-streams are being set-up as also described in [aartsetuijn06].
   However this does mean a disruption in the media-streams.  Figure 1
   also illustrates this order by first inviting the MN (1) making sure
   the MN stops sending audio to the CN, then inviting the CN (4) making
   sure the CN stops sending audio to the MN and starts sending audio to
   the AN, and only after that inviting AN to let it send audio to CN.
   This sequence also makes sure multiple sources are not sending the
   media at the same time to the same endpoint.

3.4.  Retrieval of a media-stream

   Retrieval of a media-stream can be initiated from both the terminal
   and network.  In case the media-stream was transferred by the
   terminal, it can also easily be retrieved by the terminal as
   described in paragraph 5.3.2 of [shacham06].  If a media-stream was
   transferred by the SSC, the SSC can transfer the media-stream back to
   the MN by starting a network initiated partial session transfer.

   When the SSC has transferred a media-stream, and the MN wants to
   retrieve that media-stream, the MN knows about the transferred media-
   stream because it was informed by the proposal (INVITE-message) sent
   by the SSC.  Because it has an up-to-date view on the current
   situation it is able to determine if a retrieval is necessary, and
   how it should be accomplished.  Figure 5 shows the sequence diagram
   of this, where the MN only has to re-invite the CN to retrieve the
   audio-stream.  Here the SSC does have the responsibility (As
   described in section Section 7) to make sure the sub-session with the
   AN is consistent with the session between the MN and CN.

   The other way arround, where the MN has transferred a media-stream,
   and the SSC intends to transfer that media-stream back to the MN, the
   SSC must have an up-to-date view on the current situation.  Because
   the SSC acts as a B2BUA on every session that is related to the MN,
   it is able to process all changes made in the session(s).  This way
   the SSC always has an up-to-date view of the current situation.

   indicates compliance with this specification.

   This 'pst-control' option-tag may be included in the Require header
   field of re-INVITE's sent by a B2BUA.  Nodes controlled by end-users
   should not use this option-tag in the Require header field.

   A B2BUA that wants to propose a partial session transfer to a certain
   node for a specific call must include the 'pst-control' option-tag in
   the Require field of the re-INVITE message that represents the
   proposal.

   When the 'pst-control' option-tag is present in an INVITE request, it
   also MUST contain a Pst-to header field and a Pst-call-id header
   field.

5.  The Pst-to header field

   The Pst-to header field can appear in INVITE requests where the 'pst-
   control' option-tag has been set.  This field contains the SIP-URI of
   the device the media-stream will be transferred to.  The following is
   the ABNF (augmented Backus-Naur Form) for the Pst-to header field:

   Pst-to = "Pst-to" HCOLON ( name-addr / addr-spec ) * (SEMI generic-
   param)

6.  Pst-call-id header

   The Pst-call-id header field can appear in INVITE requests where the
   'pst-control' option-tag has been set.  This field contains the
   call-id of the sub-session that will be set up with the device
   identified by the Pst-to header field.  The following is the ABNF
   (augmented Backus-Naur Form) for the Pst-call-id header field:

   Pst-call-id = "Pst-call-id" HCOLON callid

7.  Behaviour of SSC

   When the SSC wants to offer a partial session transfer to a user, it
   sends an INVITE request to the MN containing the 'pst-control'
   option-tag in the Required header, the Pst-to header field to
   indicate the targer of the transfer, the Pst-call-id header field to
   identify the sub-session being set up with the target device and the
   SDP-body to indicate what stream is being transferred and what the
   parameters of it are after the transfer.

   In case the SSC recieves a 306 response (Decline), meaning the MN
   does not want the proposed partial session transfer to be executed,
   the SSC does not continue with the execution.  When the MN does not
   support pst-control it will respond with a 420 response (Bad
   Extension), while the Unsupported header field contains the 'pst-
   control' option-tag.  The behaviour of the SSC in case the MN does
   not support pst-control is implementation specific.  The SSC could
   for example use user preferences to determine if it should continue
   or stop the execution of the partial session transfer.

   Besides a network initiated partial session transfer, a partial
   session transfer can also be initiated by the user-terminal.  This
   influences the way how the sub-sessions are handled and by which node
   they are handled.  In case the MN supports pst-control, the node that
   made the last change to a sub-session is responsible for that
   specific sub-session.  This responsibility consists of making sure
   the sub-session is consistent with the session between the MN and CN.
   In case the MN does not supports pst-control, the SSC is always
   responsible for the sub-sessions.

   Because the SSC act as a B2BUA that is located in the signalling path
   of all sessions between the device that acts as MN and it peers, it
   receives all messages of the involved nodes and must interpet them
   and make sure these messages are forwarded to other nodes
   accordingly.  As described above, if the SSC is responsible for a
   certain sub-session it must make sure the sub-session remains
   consistent with the session between the CN and MN.  This includes
   changes to a sub-session by the involved LN, where the SSC must make
   sure the sub-session and session between the MN and CN remains
   consistent.  The exact behaviour necessary is considered
   implementation specific.

8.  Behaviour when receiving INVITE with 'pst-control' in Require header

   When a node receives an INVITE message with the option tag 'pst-
   control' in the Required header according to SIP [RFC3261] it should
   only process the message further if it supports the specified
   extension.  In case it does not supports this extension it response
   with a 420 response (Bad Extension).

   In case the receiving node does support the extension it can decline
   (306 response) or accept (200 response) the proposed partial session.
   Which one applies depends should depend on what the user wants.  This
   could for example mean user-interaction is necessary before the
   proposal is accepted or decline.

9.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations as described in [shacham06] also apply
   for this proposal.  Besides those considerations here some other are
   described that are related to network initiated partial session
   transfers.

9.1.  Sender of proposal can be any node in the signalling path

   The INVITE send to the MN to propose a partial session transfer can
   virtually be send by any node in the signalling path of a certain
   session.

9.2.  Sudden disconnection of the MN

   In case a media-stream has been transferred to a LN and the MN
   suddenly disconnects, that specific media-stream does not stop
   working; it only stops when the LN or CN disconnects, or the LN, CN
   or SSC uses signalling to stop the media-stream.  The proposed method
   does not contain a mechanism to register sudden disconnects, so one
   of the involved nodes can take appropriate actions.

9.3.  MN is informed about the existence of a LN

   In case of a network initiated partial session transfer, the MN is
   informed about the existence of the involved LN at the moment it
   receives the proposal for the partial session transfer (At (1) in
   Figure 1.  It is the task of the SSC to make sure a LN is only
   exposed to nodes that are trusted.  No mechanism has been defined for
   this.

9.4.  LN is informed about the IP-address of the CN

   At the moment the MN accepts a transfer, the involved LN is informed
   about the IP-address of the CN to inform the AN to send or receive
   media from the CN (At (9) in Figure 1).  The CN might not want other
   nodes beside the MN to know about its IP-address.

10.  IANA Considerations

   Section 27 of RFC 3261 [RFC3261] creates an IANA registry for method
   names, header field names, warning codes, status codes, and option
   tags.  This specification defines two new SIP header fields and a SIP
   option tag.

10.1.  Pst-to and Pst-call-id headers

   This document defines two new SIP header fields: Pst-to and
   Pst-call-id.  These header fields needs to be registered by the IANA
   in the SIP Parameters registry under the Header Field subregistry

10.2.  Option Tag

   This section defines a new option tag per guidelines in Section 27.1
   of RFC 3261 [RFC3261].

   Name: pst-control

   Description: This option tag is used to identify support for client
   control of network initiated partial session transfers.  When present
   in a Supported header field, it indicates that an agent supports
   controlling a network initiated partial session transfer.
