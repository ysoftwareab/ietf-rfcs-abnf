             Introducing Resource Awareness to SR Segments
              draft-ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments-01

Abstract

   This document describes the mechanism to associate network resource
   attributes to Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs).  Such SIDs are
   referred to as resource-aware SIDs in this document.  The resource-
   aware SIDs retain their original forwarding semantics, but with the
   additional semantics to identify the set of network resources
   available for the packet processing action.  The resource-aware SIDs
   can therefore be used to build SR paths or virtual networks with a
   set of reserved network resources.  The proposed mechanism is
   applicable to both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and
   segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) [RFC8402] specifies a mechanism to steer packets
   through an ordered list of segments.  A segment is referred to by its
   Segment Identifier (SID).  With SR, explicit source routing can be
   achieved without introducing per-path state into the network.
   Compared with RSVP-TE [RFC3209], currently SR does not have the
   capability of reserving network resources or identifying a set of
   network resources reserved for individual services or customers.
   Although a centralized controller can have a global view of network

   state and can provision different services using different SR paths,
   in data packet forwarding it still relies on traditional DiffServ QoS
   mechanism [RFC2474] [RFC2475] to provide coarse-grained traffic
   differentiation in the network.  While such kind of mechanism may be
   sufficient for some types of services, some customers or services may
   require a set of dedicated network resources to be allocated in the
   network to achieve resource isolation from other customers/services
   in the same network.  Also note the number of such customers or
   services can be larger than the number of traffic classes available
   with DiffServ QoS.

   This document extends the SR paradigm without the need of defining
   new SID types by associating SIDs with network resource attributes.
   These resource-aware SIDs retain their original functionality, with
   the additional semantics of identifying the set of network resources
   available for the packet processing action.  One typical type of the
   network resource is bandwidth, but it is also possible to associate
   SR SIDs with other types of resources (e.g., processing or storage
   resources).  On a particular network segment, multiple resource-aware
   SIDs can be allocated, each of which represents a subset of network
   resources allocated in the network to meet the requirement of
   individual customers or services.  The allocation of network
   resources on network segments can be done either via local
   configuration or via a centralized controller.  Other approaches are
   possible such as use of a control protocol signaling, but they are
   for further study.  Each set of network resources can be associated
   with one or multiple resource-aware SIDs.  These resource-aware SIDs
   can be used to build SR paths with a set of reserved network
   resources, which can be used to carry service traffic which requires
   dedicated network resources.  The resource-aware SIDs can also be
   used to build SR based virtual networks with the required network
   topology and resource attributes.  The proposed mechanism is
   applicable to SR with both MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 data
   plane (SRv6).

2.  Segments with Resource Awareness

   In segment routing architecture [RFC8402], several types of segments
   are defined to represent either topological or service instructions.
   A topological segment can be a node segment or an adjacency segment.
   A service segment may be associated with specific service functions
   for service chaining purpose.  This document introduces additional
   resource semantics to these existing types of SIDs, so that the SIDs
   can be used to identify the topology or service functions, and also
   the set of network resources allocated on the network segments for
   packet processing.

Internet-Draft         Resource-Aware SR Segments           January 2021


   This section describes the mechanisms of using SR SIDs to identify
   the additional resource information associated with SR paths or
   virtual networks based on the two SR data plane instantiations: SR-
   MPLS and SRv6.  The mechanisms to identify the forwarding path or
   network topology with SIDs as defined in [RFC8402] can be reused, and
   the control plane can be based on [RFC4915], [RFC5120] and
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo].

2.1.  SR-MPLS

   As specified in [RFC8402], an IGP Adjacency Segment (Adj-SID) is an
   SR segment attached to a unidirectional adjacency or a set of
   unidirectional adjacencies.  An IGP Prefix Segment (Prefix-SID) is an
   SR segment attached to an IGP prefix, which identifies an instruction
   to forward the packet along the path computed using the routing
   algorithm in the associated topology.  An IGP node segment is an IGP-
   Prefix segment that identifies a specific router (e.g., a loopback).
   As described in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-central-epe] and
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe], BGP PeerAdj SID is used as
   an instruction to steer over a local interface towards a specific
   peer node in a peering Autonomous System (AS).  These types of SIDs
   can be extended to represent both topological instructions and the
   set of network resources allocated for packet processing following
   the instruction.  The MPLS instantiation of Segment Routing is
   specified in [RFC8660].

   For one IGP link, multiple resource-aware Adj-SIDs SHOULD be
   allocated, each of which is associated with a subset of the link
   resources allocated on the link, e.g. the link bandwidth.  For one
   inter-domain link, multiple BGP PeerAdj SIDs SHOULD be allocated,
   each of which is associated with a subset of the link resources
   allocated on the inter-domain link.  The resource-aware Adj-SIDs MAY
   be associated with a specific network topology and/or algorithm, so
   that it is used only for resource-aware SR paths computed within the
   topology and/or algorithm.  Note that this per-segment resource
   allocation complies to the SR paradigm, which avoids introducing per-
   path state into the network.  Several approaches can be used to
   partition the link resource, such as [FLEXE], Layer-2 logical sub-
   interfaces, dedicated queues, etc.  The detailed mechanism of link
   resource partitioning is out of scope of this document.

   For one IGP prefix, multiple resource-aware prefix-SIDs SHOULD be
   allocated.  A resource-aware prefix SID is associated with a network
   topology and/or algorithm in which the attached node participates,
   and in addition, each resource-aware prefix-SID is associated with a
   set of local resources (e.g. bandwidth, processing and storage
   resources) on each node participating in the same topology and/or
   algorithm.  Such set of network resources are used for forwarding the



Dong, et al.              Expires July 22, 2021                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Resource-Aware SR Segments           January 2021


   packets with this resource-aware prefix-SID, along the path computed
   with the associated topology and/or algorithm.

   Although each resource-aware prefix-SID can be associated with a set
   of dedicated resources, this implies additional overhead with per-
   prefix resource reservation in both control plane signaling and data
   plane states, and it is likely some resources will be wasted with
   per-prefix resource allocation along all the possible paths.  Thus it
   is RECOMMENDED that a group of resource-aware prefix-SIDs be
   associated with an aggregated set of network resources in the
   network.  This helps to reduce the dynamics in resource allocation,
   so that the resource can be allocated based on network planning and
   does not have to rely on dynamic signaling.

   For one IGP prefix, each resource-aware prefix-SID can be associated
   with a unique <topology, algorithm> tuple, in this case different
   <topology, algorithm> tuples can be used to distinguish the resource-
   aware prefix-SIDs for the same prefix.  In another case, for one IGP
   prefix, multiple resource-aware prefix-SIDs can be associated with
   the same <topology, algorithm> tuple, then an additional
   distinguisher needs to be introduced to distinguish different
   resource-aware prefix-SIDs associated with the same topology and
   algorithm but different groups of network resources.  More details
   about the new distinguisher will be described in a future version.

   A group of resource-aware SR-MPLS SIDs can be used to construct SID
   lists to steer the traffic along the explicit paths (either strict or
   loose) and be processed using the set of network resources identified
   by the SIDs.

   In data packet forwarding, each resource-aware Adj-SID identifies
   both the next-hop and the set of resources used for packet processing
   on the outgoing interface.  Each resource-aware Prefix-SID identifies
   a path to the node which the prefix is attached to, and the set of
   network resources used for packet forwarding on network nodes along
   the path.  The transit nodes determine the next-hop of the packet and
   the set of associated local resources based on the resource-aware
   prefix-SID, then forward the packet to the next-hop using the set of
   local resources.

   When the set of network resources allocated on the egress node also
   needs to be determined, It is RECOMMENDED that Penultimate Hop
   Popping (PHP) [RFC3031] be disabled, or the inner service label is
   used to infer the set of resources to be used for packet processing
   on the egress node of the SR path.

   This mechanism requires to allocate additional prefix-SIDs or adj-
   SIDs for network segments to identify different set of network

   resources.  As the number of resource groups increases, the number of
   SIDs would increase accordingly, while it should be noted that there
   is no per-path state introduced into the network.

2.2.  SRv6

   As specified in [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming], an SRv6
   Segment Identifier (SID) is a 128-bit value which consists of a
   locator (LOC) and a function (FUNCT), optionally it may also contain
   additional arguments (ARG) immediately after the FUNCT.  The Locator
   part of the SID is routable and leads to the node which instantiates
   that SID, which means the Locator can be parsed by all nodes in the
   network.  The FUNCT part of the SID is an opaque identification of a
   local function bound to the SID, and the ARG bits of the SID can be
   used to encode additional information for the processing of the
   behavoir bound to the SID.  The FUNCT and ARG parts can only be
   parsed by the node which instantiates the SRv6 SID.

   For one SRv6 node, multiple resource-aware SRv6 LOCs SHOULD be
   allocated.  A resource-aware LOC is associated with a network
   topology and/or algorithm in which the node participates, and in
   addition, a resource-aware LOC is associated with a set of local
   resources (e.g.  bandwidth, processing and storage resources) on each
   node participating in the same topology and/or algorithm.  Such set
   of network resources are used to forward the packets with SIDs which
   has the resource-aware LOC as its prefix, along the path computed
   with the associated topology and/or algorithm.  Similar to the
   resource-aware prefix-SIDs in SR-MPLS, the network resources used for
   the forwarding instruction of a group of LOCs can be aggregated, this
   helps to reduce the dynamics of resource allocation, so that the
   resource can be allocated based on network planning and does not have
   to rely on dynamic signaling.

   For one IGP link, the resource-aware SRv6 End.X SIDs are used to
   identify different set of link resources allocated.  Each resource-
   aware End.X SID SHOULD use a resource-aware LOC as its prefix.  SRv6
   SIDs for other types of functions MAY also be assigned as resource-
   aware SIDs, which can identify the set of network resources allocated
   by the node for executing the function.

   A group of resource-aware SRv6 SIDs can be used to construct SID
   lists to steer the traffic along the explicit paths (either strict or
   loose) and be processed using the set of network resources identified
   by the SRv6 SIDs and Locators.

   In data packet forwarding, each resource-aware End.X SID identifies
   both the next-hop and the set of resources used for packet processing
   on the outgoing interface.  Each resource-aware Locator identifies

   the path to the node which the LOC is assigned to, and the set of
   network resources used for packet forwarding on network nodes along
   the path.  The transit nodes determine the next-hop of the packet and
   the set of associated local resources based on the resource-aware
   Locator, then forward the packet to the next-hop using the set of
   local resources.

   This mechanism requires to allocate additional SRv6 Locators and SIDs
   for network segments to identify different set of network resources.
   As the number of resource groups increases, the number of SRv6
   Locators and SIDs would increase accordingly, while it should be
   noted that there is no per-path state introduced into the network.

3.  Control Plane Considerations

   The mechanism described in this document makes use of a centralized
   controller to collect the information about the network
   (configuration, state, routing databases, etc.) as well as the
   service information (traffic matrix, performance statistics, etc.)
   for the planning of network resources based on service requirement.
   Then the centralized controller instructs network nodes to allocate
   the network resources and associate the resources with resource-aware
   SIDs.  The resource-aware SIDs can be either explicitly provisioned
   by the controller, or dynamically allocated by network nodes then
   reported to the controller.  The controller is also responsible for
   the centralized computation and optimization of the SR paths with the
   topology, algorithm and network resource constraints.  The
   interaction between the controller and the network nodes can be based
   on PCEP [RFC5440], Netconf/YANG [RFC6241] [RFC7950] and BGP-LS
   [RFC7752].  In some scenarios, extensions to some of these protocols
   is needed, which are out of the scope of this document and will be
   specified in separate documents.  In some cases, a centralized
   controller may not be used, but this would complicate the operations
   and planning therefore not suggested.

   The distributed control plane is complementary to the centralized
   controller.  A distributed control plane can be used for the
   collection and distribution of the network topology and resource
   information associated with SIDs among network nodes, then some of
   the nodes can distribute the collected information to the centralized
   controller.  Distributed route computation for services with topology
   and resource constraints may also be needed.  The distributed control
   plane may be based on [RFC4915], [RFC5120], [I-D.ietf-lsr-flex-algo]
   or the combination of some of them with necessary extensions.  The
   details are out of the scope of this document.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of segment routing are applicable to this
   document.

   The Resource-aware SIDs may be used for provisioning of SR paths or
   virtual networks to carry traffic with latency as one of the SLA
   parameters.  By disrupting the latency of such traffic an attack can
   be directly targeted at the customer application, or can be targeted
   at the network operator by causing them to violate their SLA,
   triggering commercial consequences.  Dynamic attacks of this sort are
   not something that networks have traditionally guarded against, and
   networking techniques need to be developed to defend against this
   type of attack.  By rigorously policing ingress traffic and carefully
   provisioning the resources provided to such services, this type of
   attack can be prevented.  However care needs to be taken when
   providing shared resources, and when the network needs to be
   reconfigured as part of ongoing maintenance or in response to a
   failure.

   The details of the underlay network MUST NOT be exposed to third
   parties, to prevent attacks aimed at exploiting a shared resource.
