               draft-sarikaya-sfc-hostid-serviceheader-07

Abstract

   This document discusses how to inform Service Functions about
   service- and subscriber-related information for the sake of policy
   enforcement and appropriate SFC-inferred forwarding.  Once the
   information is consumed by SFC-aware elements of an SFC-enabled
   domain, it is stripped from packets when they leave the SFC-enabled
   domain.  Thus privacy-sensitive information is not leaked outside the
   domain.

1.  Introduction

   This document discusses how to inform Service Functions about
   service- and subscriber-related information when required for the
   sake of policy enforcement.  Indeed, subscriber-related information
   may be required to enforce subscriber-specific, SFC-based traffic
   forwarding policies, since the information carried in packets may not
   be sufficient.

   The enforcement of SFC-based differentiated traffic forwarding
   policies may also be inferred by QoS considerations.  QoS information
   may serve as an input to classification of SFP for path computation
   and establishment.

   The dynamic structuring of service function chains and their
   subsequent enforcement may be conditioned by QoS requirements that
   will affect SF instance identification, location and sequencing.

   We refer here to the definition of a logical network slice as a sub-
   network being isolated from other sub-networks using the same
   physical infrastructure.  Each of these slices are constructed to
   provide service specific QoS requirements (such as low latency, high
   availability, or high reliability) efficiently.

   SFs and SF Forwarders (SFFs) involved in an SFC have to contribute to
   the respective QoS requirements characterized by low transmission
   delay between each other, by exposing a high availability of
   resources to process function tasks, or by redundancy provided by
   stand-by machines for seamless execution continuation in case of
   failures.  These requirements may be satisfied by means of control
   protocols, but in some contexts, carrying QoS-related information in
   packets may improve the overall SFC operation instead of relying upon
   the potential complexity of SFC control plane features.

   This document adheres to the architecture defined in [RFC7665].  This
   document assumes the reader is familiar with [RFC7665] and
   [I-D.ietf-sfc-hierarchical].

   Subscriber-related information may be required to implement services
   such as, but not limited to, traffic policy control, parental
   control, traffic offload.  Such features are often provided by
   operators as part of their service portfolio.

   Another example is the applicability of service chaining in the
   context of mobile networks (typically, in the 3GPP defined (S)Gi
   Interface) [I-D.ietf-sfc-use-case-mobility].  Because of the
   widespread use of private addressing in those networks, if advanced
   SFs to be invoked are located after a NAT device (that can reside in
   the Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway (PGW) or in a distinct
   operator-specific node), the identification based on the internal IP
   address is not anymore possible once the NAT has been crossed.  As
   such, means to allow passing the internal information may optimise
   packet traversal within an SFC-enabled mobile network domain.
   Furthermore, some SFs that are not enabled on the PGW may require a
   subscriber identifier e.g., International Mobile Subscriber Identity
   (IMSI), to properly operate.  Other use cases that suffer from
   identification problems further are discussed in [RFC7620].

   Subscriber-specific information can be useful for optimized SFC
   design and SF placement/invocation, let alone slice/VPN design and
   operation.

   To ensure a service specific quality and performance per use case
   logically separated network slices will be deployed.  Each one is
   flagged by a corresponding service-related information in terms of a
   service identifier.  Examples are 'tactile internet', 'eHealth' or

   'industry control' requiring, e.g. granted low latency or extreme
   high reliability.

   This document does not make any assumption about the structure of
   service identifiers; each such service-related information is treated
   as an opaque value by the SFC operations and protocols.  The
   semantics and validation of these identifiers are up to the control
   plane used for SFC.  Expectations to SFC control plane protocols are
   laid down in [I-D.ietf-sfc-hierarchical].

   Subscriber- and service-related information is stripped from packets
   exiting an SFC-enabled domain for the sake of privacy protection in
   particular.  See Section 8 for more discussion on privacy.

   The use cases discussed in this document assume the NSH is used
   exclusively within a single administrative domain.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The reader should be familiar with the terms defined in [RFC7665].

3.  Problem Space and Sample Use Cases

   Enforcing Policies based on an internal IP address:

      Because of the address sharing, implicit CPE/UE identification
      that relies on the source IP address cannot be implemented within
      the administrative domain because the same global IPv4 address is
      shared by various connected devices (CPE for the fixed case or UE
      for the mobile case).  In the meantime, policies are something
      provisioned based on the internal IP address assigned to those
      devices.  Means to pass the internal IP address beyond an address
      sharing device for the sake of per-subscriber policy enforcement
      is needed in some SFC deployments.

      Also, identifiers like a MAC address, or an IMSI may be required
      to optimize the corresponding SFC operation.

   Enforcing Policies based on a subscriber identifier:

      In case some deployments may require per-subscriber policies,
      carrying subscriber ID information may be required for the sake of
      proper SFC operation..




Sarikaya, et al.        Expires December 23, 2018               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    Service, Subscriber and Hostid in SFC        June 2018


   Enforcing Policies based on a service specific identifier:

      SFCs can be structured according to QoS/QoE requirements that may
      be shared by different services.  In that case, service
      identification information is required to be accessible across the
      SFC for the sake of proper SFC operation.

   Below we present some use cases where problems related to enforcing
   policies based on subscriber identifiers and those based on service
   and/or slice identifiers cannot be addressed by service function
   chaining.  It is important to note that subscriber identification
   issues raised by address sharing environments are not specific to
   service function chaining.

3.1.  Parental Control Use Case

   Parental control service function searches each packet for certain
   content.  Parental control function should have permanent access to
   corresponding specific information (URL and source IP address), e.g.
   in a cache, so that all packets of the corresponding flow(s) can be
   filtered [WT317].

   Parental control function receives next packet from the recorded URL.
   Enforcing the parental control policies may depend on the internal IP
   address, i.e., the address of the subscriber's host that is being
   subject to the parental control.  Parental control function must be
   able to identify incoming traffic to be filtered, e.g., specific URL
   information.  All other traffic is not subject to parental control
   filtering.  Parental control function filters all traffic coming from
   the indicated URL only for the specific subscriber's hosts identified
   by the service logic.

   For the virtual CPE case, the access node will receive privately-
   addressed packets.  Because private IPv4 addresses are likely to
   overlap between several subscribers, the internal private IPv4
   address will need to be copied into a dedicated header in the NSH
   packet so that SFs responsible for parental control can process the
   packets appropriately.  Furthermore, the subscriber identifier may
   also be required for authorization purposes.

3.2.  Traffic Offload Use Case

   A traffic offload service function is invoked for each flow/service
   originated from a mobile terminal and this SF decides whether traffic
   should be offloaded to the broadband network or sent back to the
   mobile network.  In this use case, policy enforcement is based on the
   subscriber identifier.  The broadband network must obtain the
   subscription profile from the mobile network and decide if the



Sarikaya, et al.        Expires December 23, 2018               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    Service, Subscriber and Hostid in SFC        June 2018


   traffic coming from this subscriber needs to be offloaded or not.  If
   offloading is needed, this usually means that the subscriber
   identifier needs to be known by SFFs.

3.3.  Mobile Network Use Cases

   Many SFs can be executed in different combinations in a mobile
   network [I-D.ietf-sfc-use-case-mobility].  In particular, placement
   of NAT function (if used) plays an important role.

   If a NAT function is collocated with P-GW as in [TR23.975] or right
   after the P-GW (i.e. between P-GW and (S)Gi-LAN) then all service
   functions located upstream can only see the translated IPv4 address
   as the source address from all User Equipments (UEs).  Internal IPv4
   address-related part of their policy set won't be able to execute
   their service logic.  As a consequence, means to inform the various
   SFs of a given chain about the IPv4 address assigned to the UE and
   which will be translated into a global IPv4 address may be needed.

   Note that the same problem occurs in case IPv6 is being used by UEs,
   whenever such UEs communicate with an IPv4-only web site.  In that
   case, a NAT64 function is deployed at the P-GW.  So in the case of
   chaining NAT64 SF needs to be invoked as part of a given chain, the
   IPv6 address used by the UE may be required for the service function
   chain to work properly.

   [I-D.ietf-sfc-use-case-mobility] identifies the following
   information:

   o  Charging ID

   o  Subscriber ID

   o  GGSN or PGW IP address

   o  Serving Gateway Support Node (SGSN) or SGW IP address

   o  International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI)

   o  International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)

   o  Mobile Subscriber ISDN Number (MSISDN)

   o  UE IP address

   Several other use cases where support of traffic classification with
   respect to service chain selection to achieve efficient and flexible

   mobile service steering are described in [TR22.808].  A set of
   potential solutions are proposed and discussed in [TR23.718].

3.4.  Extreme Low Latency Service Use Cases

   Extreme or ultra-low latency requirements may be addressed by
   specific architectural and protocol characteristics to allow for
   rapid execution and low transmission delay of packets.  Candidate
   services for such requirements include e-health or vehicular
   applications.  This can be granted by forwarding all packets via the
   shortest paths only and/or via the service function instances with
   the lowest processing delay, possibly as a function of the location
   of the user.

   The corresponding service function chain should be configured based
   on the service demanding for the performance, but policies are also
   tightly related to the subscriber, i.e. whether being entitled to
   request the specific service.

3.5.  High Reliability Applications Use Cases

   Another set of use cases that require very (or ultra-) high
   reliability of services assume committed QoS parameter values and its
   possibility to act upon an expected change of the network fulfillment
   of the QoS targets [TR22.862].  That means: the QoS fulfillment is
   controlled such that in case of expected or predicted deviation a
   countermeasure by the network is invoked, e.g. either resources for
   that session are increased or a backup path is assigned in case no
   improvement is possible at least the application is informed on the
   current performance to react upon.  This can be granted by forwarding
   all packets via the most reliable and secure paths only.

4.  Subscriber Identification NSH Variable-Length Context Header

   Subscriber Identifier is defined as an optional variable-length NSH
   context header.  Its structure is shown in Figure 1.

   The subscriber identifier is used to convey an identifier already
   assigned by the service provider to uniquely identify a subscriber or
   an information that is required to enforce per-subscriber policies,
   the structure of the identifier being deployment-specific.
   Typically, this header may convey the IMSI, an opaque subscriber
   Identifier, an IP address, etc.

   The classifier and SFC-aware Service Functions MAY be instructed via
   a control interface to inject or strip a subscriber identifier
   context header.  Also, the data to be injected in such header SHOULD
   be configured to nodes authorized to inject such headers.  Failures



Sarikaya, et al.        Expires December 23, 2018               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    Service, Subscriber and Hostid in SFC        June 2018


   to inject such headers SHOULD be logged locally while a notification
   alarm MAY be sent to a Control Element.  The details of sending
   notification alarms (i.e. the parameters affecting the transmission
   of the notification alarms depend on the information in the context
   header such as frequency, thresholds, and content in the alarm: full
   header, header ID, timestamp etc.)  SHOULD be configurable by the
   control plane.

   This document adheres to the recommendations in [RFC8300] for
   handling the context headers at both ingress and egress SFC boundary
   nodes.  That is, to strip such context headers.

   SFC-aware SFs and proxies MAY be instructed to strip a subscriber
   identifier from the packet or to pass the data to the next SF in the
   chain after processing the content of the headers.  If no instruction
   is provided, the default behavior is to maintain such context headers
   so that the information can be passed to next SFC-aware hops.

   SFC-aware functions MAY be instructed via the control plane about the
   validation checks to run on the content of these context headers
   (e.g., accept only some lengths, accept some subtypes) and the
   behavior to adopt.  For example, SFC-aware nodes may be instructed to
   ignore the context header, to remove the context header from the
   packet, etc.  Nevertheless, this specification does not require nor
   preclude such additional validation checks.  These validation checks
   are deployment-specific.  If validation checks fail on a context
   header, an SFC-aware node ignores that context header.  The event
   SHOULD be logged locally while a notification alarm MAY be sent to a
   control element if the SFC-aware node is instructed to do so.

   Multiple subscriber Identifier context TLVs MAY be present in the NSH
   each carrying a distinct sub-type.

   o  Type: TBD1 (See Section 6)

   o  SubT field of 8 bits indicates the sub-type of the information
      conveyed in the "Subscriber Identifier" field.  The following
      values are defined:

      *  0x00: Opaque value

      *  0x01: Charging ID.  The structure of this ID is deployment-
         specific.

      *  0x02: Subscriber ID.  The structure of this ID is deployment-
         specific.

      an identifier that corresponds to the sub-type.

5.  Slice and Service Identification NSH Variable-Length Context Headers

   Dedicated service- and slice-specific performance identifiers are
   defined to differentiate between services requiring specific
   treatment to exhibit a performance characterized by, e.g., ultra-low
   latency (ULL) or ultra-high reliability (UHR).  These parameters are
   related to slice and service identifiers, among others.  They are
   contained in the service Identifier.  The service Identifier thus
   allows for the enforcement of a per service policy such as a service
   classification function to only consider specific Service Function
   instances during service function path establishment.  Details of
   this process are implementation- specific.  For illustration
   purposes, the classifier may retrieve the details of usable service
   functions based upon the corresponding service or slice ID.  Typical
   criteria for instantiating specific service functions include
   location, performance or proximity considerations.  For UHR services,
   the stand-by operation of back-up capacity or the deployment of
   multiple service function instances may be requested.

   In other words, the classifier uses this kind of information to
   decide about the set of SFFs to invoke to honor the latency or
   reliability requirement (e.g., compute an Rendered Service Path, RSP,
   or insert a pointer to be shared with involved SFFs).

   Slice and Service Identifiers are defined as optional variable length
   context headers.  Their structure is shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3,
   respectively.

   Service/Slice Identifier context header MAY convey a user or service
   provider defined unique identity which can be described by an opaque
   value.

   The service requirements in terms of, e.g., maximum latency or
   minimum outage probability are specified by service providers and are
   out of the scope of this document.

   Only one Slice Identifier context header (as described in Section 1)
   MUST be present in the NSH.

   Multiple Service Identifier context headers MAY be present in the
   NSH; each carrying a distinct sub-type.

        Figure 3: Service Identifier Variable-Length Context Header

   The description of the fields is as follows:

   o  Metadata Class: MUST be set to 0x0 [RFC8300].

   o  Type: TBD3 (See Section 6)

   o  SubT: 8-bit field that carries the sub-type of the information
      conveyed in the "Service Identifier" field.  The following values
      are defined:

      *  0x00: Opaque value

      *  0x01: Ultra-low latency ID.  The structure of this ID is
         service deployment-specific.

      *  0x02: Ultra-high reliability ID.  The structure of this ID is
         service deployment-specific.

      *  0x03: Slice Identifier.  The structure of this ID is service
         deployment-specific.

      *  0x04 - 0x08: reserved

   o  Service Identifier: Represents a specific service performance
      characteristic reflected in the SubT field, but also denotes a
      default basic (best effort) service without specifically defined
      requirements.  It MAY also be an opaque value which semantic is
      defined by the operator.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to assign the followiing types from the
   "NSH IETF- Assigned Optional Variable-Length Metadata Types" (0x0000
   IETF Base NSH MD Class) registry available at:
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/nsh/nsh.xhtml#optional-variable-
   length-metadata-types.

7.  Security Considerations

   Data plane SFC-related security considerations are discussed in
   [RFC7665] and [RFC8300].

   A misbehaving node can inject subscriber Identifiers to disturb the
   service offered to some subscribers.  Also, a misbehaving node can
   inject subscriber identifiers as an attempt to be granted access to
   some services.  To prevent such misbehavior, only trusted nodes MUST
   be able to inject such context headers.  Nodes that are involved in a
   SFC-enabled domain are assumed to be trusted ([RFC8300]).  Means to
   check that only authorized nodes are solicited when a packet is
   crossing an SFC-enabled domain.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   The metadata defined in this document for subscriber identifiers may
   reveal private information about the subscriber.  Some privacy-
   related considerations for Internet Protocols are discussed in
   [RFC6973] and [RFC6967].  In the light of these privacy
   considerations, it is important to state that the subscriber metadata
   MUST NOT be exposed outside the operator's domain.  This requirement
   is already supported by the NSH [RFC8300].  That is, NSH is stripped
   systematically at the egress of a service chain.

   The information conveyed in subscriber identifiers is already known
   to an administrative entity managing an SFC-enabled domain.  Some of
   that information is already conveyed in the original packets from a
   host (e.g., internal IP address) while other information is collected
   from various sources (e.g., GTP tunnel, line identifier, etc.).
   Conveying such sensitive information in packets may expose
   subscribers' sensitive data to entities that are not allowed to
   receive such information.  Misbehaving SFC egress nodes is a threat
   that may have negative impacts on privacy (e.g., some operational
   networks leak the MSISDN outside).  Operators MUST ensure their SFC-
   enabled domain is appropriately conforming to the NSH specification
   so that any privacy-related information is not exposed outside the
   SFC-enabled domain.

   Some use cases that rely upon the solution defined in this document
   may disclose some additional privacy-related information (e.g., a
   host identifier of a terminal within a customer premises for the
   parental control case).  It is assumed that this information is
   provided upon approval from a subscriber [RFC8165].  For example, a
   customer may provide the information as part of its service
   management interface or as part of explicit subscription form.
