Abstract

   This document is intended to accomplish two highly inter-related
   tasks: to establish an "initial" Internet Code Point (ICP) assignment
   for each of IPv4 and IPv6 address encoding in Network Service Access
   Point (NSAP) Addresses, and to recommend an IANA assignment policy
   for currently unassigned ICP values. In the first task, this document
   is a partial replacement for RFC 1888 - particularly for section 6 of
   RFC 1888. In the second task, this document incorporates wording and
   specifications from ITU recommendation X.213 and further recommends
   that IANA use the "IETF consensus" assignment policy in making future
   ICP assignments.

1. Introduction

   Section 6 of RFC 1888 [1888] previously provided for assignment of
   the initial Internet Code Point (ICP) value '0' for encoding an IPv6
   address in a Network Service Access (or Attachment) Point (NSAP)
   address. RFC 1888 also defined multiple means for restricted encoding
   of an NSAP address in an IPv6 address.

   The means RFC 1888 defined for encoding NSAP addresses in IPv6
   address format, was heavily annotated with warnings and limitations
   that apply should this encoding be used. Possibly as a result, these
   encodings are not used and appear never to have been used in any IPv6
   deployment. In addition, section 6 contains minor errors. As a result
   of these various considerations, an Internet Draft [BC] has been
   submitted recommending that RFC 1888 be made historical.

   It is the belief of the authors of this document that the errors in 
   section 6 of RFC 1888 were - at least in part - the result of the
   fact that the ITU specification [X.213] that originally assigned
   Authority and Format Indentifier (AFI) 35 to IANA was not freely
   publicized, nor was it incorporated or explained using the mechanism
   commonly used in the IETF - i.e. - via an RFC.

   It is therefore part of the purpose of this document to provide that
   explanation.

   In addition, because there are other documents that refer to the IPv6 
   ICP assignment in RFC 1888, it is necessary for the errors in section
   6 of RFC 1888 to be corrected - irrespective of the RFC's ultimate 
   status.

   Finally, no previous RFC - including RFC 1888 - has ever formalized

   an assignment of an IPv4 ICP. This may have been - in part - because
   of a lack of formal definition of an IANA assignment policy for ICP
   values under the IANA allocated AFI (35).

   This document replaces section 6 of RFC 1888 in defining the ICP for
   IPv6 address encoding in an NSAP address - and - formalizes the ICP
   assignment for IPv4 address encoding in an NSAP address.

2. IANA Considerations

   An ITU Recommendation [X.213] has allocated two AFI designating IANA 
   as the assignment authority. One of these two AFI ('34') is allocated 
   for assignment of NSAPA in Decimal Numeric Format. This document does
   not address allocation for this AFI as it is not clear what - if any
   - use can be made of this encoding format at this time. The other AFI 
   ('35') is to be used for binary encoding except as noted below.

   The NSAPA format consists of an Initial Domain Part (IDP) and Domain
   Specific Part (DSP).  The IDP, in turn, consists of an Authority and
   Format Identifier (AFI) and an Initial Domain Identifier (IDI). The
   AFI is defined to be a binary octet and the IDI is defined to be four 
   decimal encoded in two octets using Binary Coded Decimal format.
   Each nibble of the IDI is used to represent a decimal digit - using
   binary value '0000' through '1001'.

   In assigning allocation authority for AFI '35' to IANA, ITU-T


Internet Draft             Expires January 2006                 Page 3
 
Gray, et al         Internet Code Point Assignments      February 2005


   [X.213] recommendation specifies that the two octet IDI will be used
   to hold an Internet Code Point (ICP) which - because of the decimal
   encoding - MUST be in the decimal range from '0' to '9999'.
 
   The ITU recommendation assumes the assignment of ICP '0' (zero) for
   IPv6 address encoding in an Network Service Access Point Address 
   (NSAPA or - often - NSAP). In addition, ITU-T assumed that IANA 
   would assign an ICP for IPv4 address encoding in an NSAPA and X.213
   assumes that the ICP value for this purpose would be '1'.

   In an NSAPA, the DSP is the remaining octets after the IDP. For AFI 
   '35', this is 17 octets having a format as defined by IANA - or as
   defined by another party and published with IANA consent.

   IANA - as the Authority responsible for the Authority and Format 
   Identifier (AFI) '35' - SHOULD NOT assign an ICP unless there is
   a corresponding defined, and published, format at the time of the
   code point assignment.

   As of the time this document is published as an RFC - with consent
   of IANA - the following ICP values are assigned:

       ICP Value   Address Encoding   Format Definition
       ----------  -----------------  ----------------------------
          '0'           IPv6          <this document>, section 3.2
          '1'           IPv4          <this document>, section 3.1

   Remaining decimal values '2' through '9999' SHOULD be assigned on
   an IETF consensus basis, with IANA consent.


3. Initial Allocations and Uses

   This document continues the ICP assignment and format definition as
   previously defined in RFC 1888, and formalizes the allocation of ICP
   value '1' for IPv4 encoding and the format to be used. The sections
   below describe the specific IPv4 and IPv6 address encoding formats.

3.1. IPv4 Address Encoding in an NSAPA

   If it is required, for whatever reason, to embed an IPv4 address
   inside a 20-octet NSAP address, then the following format MUST be
   used.

   A specific possible use of this embedding is to express an IP address
   within the ATM Forum address format.  Another possible use would be
   to allow CLNP packets that encapsulate IPv4 packets to be routed in a
   CLNP network using the IPv4 address architecture. Several leading
   bytes of the IPv4 address could be used as a CLNP routing prefix.

   An NSAPA with an AFI value of '35' and an ICP value of '1' (one) 
   encodes a 4 byte IPv4 address in the first 4 octets of the DSP.
   The last 13 octets of the DSP are unspecified in this document.  To 
   maintain compatibility with both NSAP format and IPv4 addressing, 
   these octets MUST be present, but have no intrinsic significance 
   for IPv4. The default values for the unspecified octets is zero.

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   An NSAPA with the IANA AFI code and ICP set to '1' (one) is converted 
   to an IPv4 address by stripping off the first 3 and the last 13
   octets.  If the NSAP addressed contents are passed to a higher layer,
   the last 13 octets SHOULD be presented to the higher layer as well.

   If an NSAP address using this encoding is used for routing in an IPv4
   routing architecture, only the 4 byte IPv4 address MAY be considered.

3.2. IPv6 Address Encoding in an NSAPA

   If it is required, for whatever reason, to embed an IPv6 address
   inside a 20-octet NSAP address, then the following format MUST be
   used.

   A specific possible use of this embedding is to express an IP address
   within the ATM Forum address format.  Another possible use would be
   to allow CLNP packets that encapsulate IPv6 packets to be routed in a
   CLNP network using the IPv6 address architecture. Several leading
   bytes of the IPv6 address could be used as a CLNP routing prefix.

   An NSAPA with an AFI value of '35' and an ICP value of '0' (zero) 
   encodes a 16 byte IPv6 address in the first 16 octets of the DSP.
   The last octet of the DSP is a selector.  To maintain compatibility 
   with both NSAP format and IPv6 addressing, this octet MUST be
   present, but it has no intrinsic significance for IPv6. Its default
   value is zero, but other values may be used as specified for any
   specific application. For example, this octet may be used to specify
   one of 255 possible port numbers.

   An NSAPA with the IANA AFI code and ICP set to '0' (zero) is 
   converted to an IPv6 address by stripping off the first three and the
   twentieth octets. If the NSAP addressed contents are passed to a
   higher layer, the last octet SHOULD be presented to the higher layer
   as well.

   If an NSAP address using this encoding is used for routing in an IPv6
   routing architecture, only the 16 byte IPv6 address MAY be
   considered.


4. Security Considerations

   Security issues are not specifically addressed in this document, as
   the NSAP encoding of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses is compatible with the
   corresponding security mechanisms of RFC 1825 [1825].
