1.  Introduction

   There is currently one W3C specification (Media Capture and Streams
   [W3C.WD-mediacapture-streams-20150212]) that has need of a registry
   in which to represent constrainable properties, and it is expected
   that others will as well.  The specification makes use of a data
   structure representing a list of constraints on the HTML media or
   media connection to be established.  Additionally, the specification
   defines methods that are used to query the web browser about its
   capabilities.  The returned data structure specifies the browser's
   capabilities in terms of constraints that it can satisfy.  The data
   structures and their use are defined as the Constrainable Pattern in
   the aforementioned specification.  This document specifies the
   registry used to define individual constrainable property names,
   their allowed values, and their meanings.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a registry "RTCWeb Constrainable Properties"
   for use by W3C specifications needing to indicate constrainable
   properties on HTML Media and other constrainable objects, both as
   used by web application authors to indicate preferences and as used
   by web browsers to indicate constrainable properties they can
   satisfy.

3.1.  RTCWeb Constrainable Properties

   IANA SHALL create a new name space of "RTCWeb Constrainable
   Properties".  All maintenance within and additions to the contents of
   this name space MUST be according to the "Specification Required with
   Expert Review" registration policy as defined in RFC5226 [RFC5226].
   The registry is initially empty.  The registry is defined in the
   remainder of this section.

   Each registry entry consists of a Name and a Reference (or list of
   references).

   An RTCWeb Constrainable Property Name MUST satisfy the following ABNF
   [RFC5234] specification:

   rtcweb-constrainable-property = constrainable-property-name
   constrainable-property-name   = %x41-5A 0*constraint-char
   constraint-char               = ALPHA / DIGIT


   RTCWeb Constrainable Property Names are case-sensitive.

   A registration request MUST include the following information:

   o  The RTCWeb Constrainable Property Name to be registered

   o  Name and Email address of a contact person for the registration

   o  Organization or individuals having the change control

   o  Reference(s) to the specification(s) defining the property

3.1.1.  Designated Expert Instructions

   RTCWeb Constrainable Property Names are of unlimited length according
   to the syntax.  However, it is RECOMMENDED that they be no longer
   than 80 characters in total.  This is to keep them reasonable for
   humans to read and use.  It is RECOMMENDED that Names use camel case,
   i.e., when a Name consists of multiple words, the first character of
   each word SHOULD be an uppercase character, with all others being
   lowercase.

   The References MUST define the following for each RTCWeb
   Constrainable Property:

   allowed values

         The References MUST define the allowed values for the property,
         for example an enumerated list of values or a range of
         integers.

   object(s)
         The References MUST define the object or objects for which the
         properties apply, for example a MediaStreamTrack.

   The RTCWeb Constrainable Property MUST be well enough defined in the
   given References that it is understandable by implementors and
   application developers that will use the property.  The property
   SHOULD NOT duplicate a condition that can be achieved using
   properties already defined in the registry.  The property Name SHOULD
   be appropriate and specific enough for the property.

4.  Security Considerations

   Since the constrainable properties envisioned for this registry are
   fairly generic in nature, it is not expected that the mere existence
   of this registry will introduce any particular security issues.  Any
   specification defining one or more new properties SHOULD address any
   specific security issues that might be introduced by the properties
   or their constrainable values.
