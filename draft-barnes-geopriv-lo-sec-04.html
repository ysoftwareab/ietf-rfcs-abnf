Introduction</h3>

<p>The basic privacy and security model for location distribution over
      the Internet are discussed in RFC 3693 and RFC 3694 <a class='info' href='#RFC3693'>[RFC3693]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Cuellar, J., Morris, J., Mulligan, D., Peterson, J., and J. Polk, &ldquo;Geopriv Requirements,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a><a class='info' href='#RFC3694'>[RFC3694]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Danley, M., Mulligan, D., Morris, J., and J. Peterson, &ldquo;Threat Analysis of the Geopriv Protocol,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>. RFC 3693
      documents describe a set of roles that entities play in the location
      distribution process, and the security and privacy requirements that
      entities in those roles must satisfy. RFC 3694 describes a set of
      threats to the privacy of location information and how those threats can
      be mitigated within the framework of RFC 3693.
</p>
<p>RFCs 3693 and 3694 define a very general framework of privacy and
      security requirements. Since the publication of those documents,
      additional use cases have arisen that require more detailed discussion
      of how privacy mechanisms are to be applied. This document provides
      additional detail and explanation of privacy and security concerns in
      three areas: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>How privacy rules are enforced by an LS and the role of
          identifiers in this process
</li>
<li>How privacy rules should be interpreted in store-and-forward
          networks, and
</li>
<li>How an LO can be provided security properties end-to-end (between
          creation and ultimate use)
</li>
</ol><p>These topics are addressed in <a class='info' href='#priv-sec'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Privacy rule enforcement</span><span>)</span></a>,
      <a class='info' href='#sip-sec'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Location privacy in store-and-forward networks</span><span>)</span></a>, and <a class='info' href='#e2e-sec'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>End-to-End Assurances about Location Content and Access</span><span>)</span></a>,
      respectively.

Terminology</h3>

<p>This document uses the following terms defined RFC 3693: Location
      Generator (LG), Location Object (LO), Location Recipient (LR), Location
      Server (LS), Target, privacy rule.
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Privacy rule enforcement</h3>

<p>One of the critical privacy-preserving components of the Geopriv
      framework is the application of authorization policies by an LS. This
      feature is what enables an LS to store and forward information about the
      location of Targets and still act as a privacy preserving entity. Rule
      Makers provision the LS with authorization policies, and the LS
      restricts the location information that it transmits over its
      notification interface in order to comply with these rules and preserve
      the privacy of location information accessible through the LS.
</p>
<p>In this section, we define an abstract model for the constituent
      parts of the rule enforcement process. In this model, the authorization
      policies guiding how the LS should provide location are represented by
      logical triples of the form (identifier, rules, location). We discuss
      the privacy impact of choices for each of these three parts. Finally, we
      examine how this framework maps onto a set of deployment scenarios.
</p>

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Reference model</h3>

<p>Protocols that implement the notification interface for an LS can
        generally be decomposed into messages that request location (sent from
        LR to LS) and messages that respond to location requests (sent from LS
        to LR). This distinction is natural for a synchronous request/response
        protocol. In an asynchronous publish/subscribe pattern, the request
        messages are requests for subscriptions and the responses are
        publications for those subscriptions. (In the case where the
        transmission is initiated by another entity than the LR, an implicit
        request by the initiating entity is assumed.) The process of applying
        authorization policies is thus the process that tells the LS what, if
        any, location to return in response to a given request.
</p>
<p>The overall privacy-enhanced location distribution process is
        illustrated in <a class='info' href='#config-fig'>Figure&nbsp;1</a> (an expanded view of
        Figure 1 in RFC 3693). A location server is configured with a set of
        location information sources (LGs) that provide information to
        location contexts. Authorization contexts are created on the LS by
        Rule Makers. Location Recipients access location by means of these
        contexts, in compliance with the specified policies.

<p>The input to the a given decision is a location request. While the
        specific semantics available in requests will vary according to the
        protocol, all requests will contain two general data:</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>An identifier for the desired location object(s)
</li>
<li>A set of parameters that describe acceptable responses
</li>
</ol><p>Many requests will also contain an identifier for the
        requesting LR, such as an IP address or SIP URI (such identification
        may be required in some authorization scenarios).
</p>
<p>For example, in a SIP SUBSCRIBE request <a class='info' href='#RFC3265'>[RFC3265]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Roach, A., &ldquo;Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>, the desired LO is identified by the Request
        URI, and any parameters are described in the body of the message; the
        LR is identified by the authenticated identity of the subscriber. In
        the HELD location configuration protocol <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-geopriv-http-location-delivery'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;geopriv&#8209;http&#8209;location&#8209;delivery]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Barnes, M., Winterbottom, J., Thomson, M., and B. Stark, &ldquo;HTTP Enabled Location Delivery (HELD),&rdquo; August&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, the source
        IP address of request is used to identify the LO to be returned (as
        well as the recipient), and the request body can specify whether the
        returned LO should be in geodetic or civic form (among other
        parameters).
</p>
<p>In order to respond to a request, an LS must first decide whether
        the request is authorized, and second, if authorized, construct an LO
        to be sent in response. The actions the LS takes in this process are
        defined by "authorization contexts", consisting of three elements:
        </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>An identifier for the context
</li>
<li>A set of privacy rules
</li>
<li>A location context
</li>
</ol><p> The identifier in the context is the one that LRs use in
        their requests, and uniquely identifies the context within the scope
        of the LS. The privacy rules describe constraints on the request, on
        the returned LO, and on the context itself. The location context
        describes how the LS is to construct the base LO (which will be
        returned after being transformed by the privacy rules). Each of these
        elements is discussed in more detail in their respective sections
        below.
</p>
<p>Having been provisioned with a set of authorization contexts, the
        LS constructs its response to a location request in three steps: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Retrieve the context with the identifier specified in the
            request (if none, reject request).
</li>
<li>Match the request against the privacy rules in the
            authorization context. If authorized, proceed; otherwise, reject
            the request.
</li>
<li>Retrieve the base LO from the location context in the
            authorization context. Transform according to privacy rules and
            request parameters.
</li>

<p>Note that all three parts of an authorization context are
        independent, and can be combined in a many-to-many fashion: For
        example, a single rule set can be applied to many authorization
        contexts, a single location context can have many different rule sets
        associated with it in different authorization contexts, and the same
        (rule set, location context) pair may be the basis for several
        independent authorization contexts. The identifier, however, must
        uniquely identify a context within the scope of the LS.
</p>
<p>Authorization contexts are specified and provisioned to the LS by
        Rule Makers, not necessarily in the form described above (i.e., some
        parts may be implicitly specified). For example, when a presentity
        provisions a presence server with a rule set for its location-enhanced
        presence, it has implicitly created an authorization context with its
        presence URI, its location-enhanced presence, and the specified rule
        set. Other policy provisioning protocols may allow RMs to explicitly
        specify all three attributes. As in the model of RFC 3693, many
        different parties can be Rule Makers, including, for example, the
        Target of the LOs being presented (or third-parties acting on their
        behalf), or the operator of the LS. The LS ultimately decides which
        entities are authorized to be Rule Makers by granting or denying the
        ability to create or manipulate authorization contexts.
</p>
<p>In constructing its response to a request, the LS uses each element
        of an authorization context in turn. First, in order for a request to
        be valid, the LO identifier in the request must match the identifier
        for some authorization context on the LS. This is the authorization
        context the LS uses for the remainder of the process; if no context is
        found, the request fails. Second, the LS determines whether the
        constraints that the rule set places on the request and the context
        are satisfied. If these constraints are not satisfied, the request
        fails. If the constrains are satisfied, then the LS constructs a
        location object as described by the location context, transforms it to
        meet the requirements of the rule set, and returns the resulting
        LO.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.1.1.&nbsp;
Context identifiers</h3>

<p>The first step in the process of responding to a location request
          is to use an identifier from the request to identify the
          authorization context to be used to respond to the request. If no
          authorization context matches the identifier in the request, then no
          location is returned by the LS. The privacy of this identifiers is
          thus a first control on the privacy of the referenced location
          information. Identifiers can be either public or private:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Public Identifier:</dt>
<dd>An identifier that is generally
              available, or which can be guessed by an LR based only on public
              information (such as the identity of the LS or a public
              identifier of the Target)
</dd>
<dt>Private Identifier:</dt>
<dd>An identifier that is not
              public. A private identifier may be derived in part from public
              information, but must contain sufficient non-public components
              that guessing the entire identifier would require significant
              effort by an entity not already in possession of the
              identifier.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>(The distinction between "public" and "private" identifiers
          is closely related to the distinction between linked and unlinked
          pseudonyms. For example, an unlinked pseudonym can be used as a
          private identifier for a context that refers to that entity's location. We
          avoid those terms here, however, because context identifiers
          identify authorization contexts, not necessarily endpoints or
          Targets.)
</p>
<p>Whether an identifier is private or public is determined by the
          set of entities that have access to it, not by its contents. Even if
          a URI is constructed to be difficult to guess, it can still be
          public if it is exposed to public access (e.g., by posting on an
          open web page). In order to an identifier to stay private, it must
          be communicated only to authorized entities over
          confidentiality-protected channels, and it must be difficult for a
          third party to guess based on public information.
</p>
<p>Because private identifiers are known initially only to the LS
          and RM, in order to be used to retrieve location, they must be sent
          to LRs over some dissemination channel (possibly composed of several
          steps using different protocols). The security properties of this
          channel influence how strongly the privacy of an identifier is
          protected. All entities that can observe the identifier through the
          dissemination channel are able to request LOs within its scope
          (assuming that they can find the correct LS to query). In order to
          mitigate the privacy risks introduced in this way, private
          identifiers should always be sent over authenticated,
          confidentiality-protected channels.
</p>
<p>The requirement that a private identifier be difficult to guess
          means that the identifier must contain a component that is randomly
          generated by the LS or the RM (where the randomness is from the
          perspective of an outside third party). The required amount of
          randomness in the random component (its entropy, corresponding to
          the length of a string of randomly-chosen bits) will vary by
          application. In applications where an LR can make many guesses, the
          entropy will need to be correspondingly large. In applications where
          the LS limits the number of guesses an LR can make, or the rate at
          which it can make them, the entropy may be lower (in some such
          applications, it may even be acceptable to use public identifiers
          under this constraint). As a baseline suitable for nearly all
          applications using private identifiers, this document recommends the
          incorporation of a 128-bit string chosen at random by the LS or the
          RM.
</p>
<p>Randomness, however, is neither necessary nor sufficient for an
          identifier to be private. Some identifiers that seem random, such as
          IP addresses and MAC addresses, must be considered public because
          the can easily be observed in network traffic. The following are
          examples of public and private identifiers: </p>
<ul class="text">

</li>
<li>Undisclosed SIP AoR: &lt;sip:bob@example.net&gt;
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>By choosing the types of identifiers they use for contexts, RMs
          can create a coarse-grained access control. Allowing the use of a
          public identifier essentially makes all LOs within the scope of the
          associated location context available for public use, and allowing
          the use of a private identifier grants access only to entities that
          have access to the identifier. This means that when the only control
          on access to a context is the privacy of the identifier (i.e., when
          the rules grant all requests), the privacy of the LO is essentially
          the privacy of the identifier.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.2"></a><h3>3.1.2.&nbsp;
Rule sets</h3>

<p>The rule set contained in a context define constraints on when
          the LS may grant requests and when it must deny them. These
          constraints are placed on three things: The requests themselves, the
          LO to be returned, and the context itself. The following are some
          example rules of all three types:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>[request] Grant only requests from the subnet 19.0.2.0/24
</li>
<li>[request] Grant only requests made by
              &lt;sip:alice@example.com&gt; and
              &lt;sip:bob@example.net&gt;
</li>
<li>[LO] Grant access only to geodetic location
</li>
<li>[LO] Grant access only to location accurate to within 100
              meters.
</li>
<li>[context] Grant access only to the first three requests for
              this authorization context
</li>
<li>[context] Grant access only to requests for this
              authorization context before midnight on December 31, 2008
</li>
</ul>

<p>Rules enter into contexts in two ways: Through the RM, or through
          the LO. "Local" rules are installed by RMs, and are a fixed part of
          the context. "Sticky" rules are attached to the base LO returned by
          the location context, and travel along with the LO from LS to LR.
          Local rules are applied as part of the initial authorization of the
          request (step 2 in the model above), while sticky rules must be
          applied after the base LO has been provided by the location context
          (step 3).
</p>
<p>Rules can be enforced in two ways: By denying queries or by
          transforming the LO prepared by the location context before
          returning it. (In the language of Common Policy, these two actions
          are specified by conditions and transformations.) For example, the
          third rule above could be enforced either by rejecting requests that
          require geodetic location or by transforming the returned LO to
          remove non-geodetic location. These two types of enforcement are
          equivalent, in the sense that a transformation can remove all
          unauthorized parts of the LO; if the whole LO is removed, then the
          request is effectively denied.
</p>
<p>Rules are communicated from an RM to an LS (or, for sticky rules,
          from LG to LS) in a rules language that defines a syntax and
          semantics for describing specific rules. For example, the Common
          Policy rules language <a class='info' href='#RFC4745'>[RFC4745]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Tschofenig, H., Morris, J., Cuellar, J., Polk, J., and J. Rosenberg, &ldquo;Common Policy: A Document Format for Expressing Privacy Preferences,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> describes a
          broad framework for rule specifications, and Geopriv policy defines
          a language for location-specific rules.
</p>
<p>In order to minimize the probability that rules will lead to
          unintentionally allowed access, a rule syntax must follow a
          default-deny pattern: A rule set with no rules denies access to all
          requests, and the rules in the rule set grant specific accesses.
          This is the pattern followed by the example rules above, and by the
          common policy framework.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.3"></a><h3>3.1.3.&nbsp;
Location contexts</h3>

<p>The location context within an authorization context tells the LS
          how it should construct the base location object, which will be
          transformed by privacy rules before being returned. For example, the
          location context might specify that the base LO is a single fixed LO
          for all time (a "snapshot" context), or it may specify that the
          location of the Target should be determined anew for every request,
          using a specific positioning method (a "tracking" context).
</p>
<p>Since the transformations applied to the returned LO by the
          privacy rules can only remove information from the LO (they do not
          add new location information), the location context sets the maximum
          amount of information available to LRs. If the location context
          returns a snapshot, then an LR cannot access location for another
          time even if it would be allowed by policy. Thus, when specifying
          location contexts, RMs should give them the minimum scope that is
          required by the application.

Location dereference server</h3>

<p>A location dereference server is a Location Server at the center
          of the "location by reference" model for location distribution:
          Rather than distributing location objects directly, entities that
          want to communicate location information distribute "references" to
          location objects. (In the model above, references are identifiers
          for authorization contexts.) In order to obtain a location object,
          an LR sends a request to the proper LS that includes the reference,
          and the LS returns location according to the corresponding
          authorization context.
</p>
<p>A location deference server receives location objects from a
          Location Generator; in some situations, this LG is the Target of the
          LOs provided, in others, the LG is a generic, automated positioning
          function. The location context within an authorization context will
          specify the source of location for the context.
</p>
<p>Authorization contexts (privacy rules in particular) are
          provisioned on the LS by authorized Rule Makers, either via an
          automated provisioning protocol (e.g. XCAP) or via an out-of-band
          provisioning mechanism (e.g. a web interface or a contractual
          arrangement with the target). These privacy rules may specify a
          policy allowing public identifiers, requiring private identifiers,
          or some combination of the two.
</p>
<p>The scenario in which a dereference server is deployed will
          influence what types of rules it can practically apply. For
          instance, if references are to be distributed widely, so that the LS
          will not be able to authenticate the identities of LRs, then the LS
          will not be able to apply rules based on the identity of the LR.

Location-enhanced presence server</h3>

<p>A location-enhanced presence server is a special case of a
          location dereference server in which the dereference protocol is SIP
          Presence. Authorization contexts are created when the Target (the
          presentity) provides rules to the presence server: The identifier
          for the context is the presence URI of the presentity, the rules are
          those provided, and the location context specifies that the base LO
          is the most recent one received in a PUBLISH request.
</p>
<p>In contrast to the general location-by-reference scenario,
          Location Recipients served by a presence server generally possess
          credentials for authenticating themselves to the presence server.
          Therefore, policies that rely heavily on identity-based access
          controls and the use of public identifiers are generally well-suited
          to the presence environment.

&quot;On-behalf-of&quot; server</h3>

<p>An "On Behalf Of" (OBO) server is a special case of a location
          dereference server where the reference identifiers are public. OBO
          is a mechanism for LRs to obtain location information by reference,
          without requiring the reference to be distributed to the LR. For
          this reason, OBO servers are often used to support legacy target
          devices that lack location capabilities. And since devices that are
          not location-aware are unlikely to support automated rules
          processes, rule provisioning for an OBO server is generally done in
          a non-automated fashion (such as a contractual arrangement with the
          target, or a web interfaces), though this does not preclude the use
          of an automated mechanism.
</p>
<p>In the OBO scenario, the use of identity-based rules is
          particularly important, since the identifiers used purposely do not
          constrain access. In order to ensure that location is only provided
          to authorized entities, an OBO server must authenticate all LRs that
          submit requests, and authorize these requestors according to policy
          provided by the Target (through an automated or out-of-band
          mechanism).

Location configuration</h3>

<p>A Location Information Server (LIS) is an entity that provides a
          location configuration service: It provides endpoints with access to
          their own location, often as a function of the local network to
          which the endpoint is attached. A LIS can provide access to location
          in two ways: By value, providing LOs directly, and by reference,
          providing identifiers (commonly URIs).
</p>
<p>When a LIS distributes location by value, the location
          configuration scenario is a reduced version of the general model of
          <a class='info' href='#config-fig'>Figure&nbsp;1</a>. The Location Server is the same
          as the Location Generator and the Rule Maker, and the Location
          Recipient is always the Target. In this case, there is a logical
          authorization context for each endpoint: The identifier is an
          identifier for the client (e.g., an IP address), the rules specify
          that only the client is authorized (though the LS can make
          additional constraints), and the location context provides the
          location of the client. In practice, an LIS can implement this using
          a single rule that simply provides each requestor with its own
          location.
</p>
<p>Note that since the LIS only provides location to the target (the
          primary rule-maker), it does not require a rules provisioning
          interface. Indeed, a common use-case if for the target, after
          receiving the location object from the LIS, to modify the location
          object to add additional privacy rules prior to publishing the
          object to a subsequent location server.
</p>
<p>When a LIS distributes location by reference, it is not acting as
          a Geopriv principal, since it is not distributing a location
          object. Rather, it is acting as part of the dissemination channel
          that distributes a context identifier to authorized LRs. Such a LIS
          acts on behalf of a location dereference server by provides
          references to the target's location.
</p>
<p>In the some location-by-reference scenarios, the LIS is unable
          accept rules from the Target. In these cases, the LIS must use only
          private identifiers as references, and must these provide these
          references only to the target himself. (In this case, the
          location-by-reference LIS has identical privacy properties to the
          location-by-value LIS). When the LIS is able to accept privacy rules
          from the target (either via on automated provisioning protocol, or
          via an out-of-band mechanism), it may provide private identifiers to
          parties as specified by the target's privacy policy, and
          additionally my provide public identifiers if allowed by the privacy
          policy (and supported by the associated dereference server).

End-to-End Assurances about Location Content and Access</h3>

<p>The life-cycle of a location object often consists of a series of
      location transmissions in which the location recipient in given
      transmission acts as a location server in the following transmission
      (see <a class='info' href='#end-to-end'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>End-to-End Location Distribution</span><span>)</span></a>). For example, location might
      initially be published to a location configuration server which then
      transmits the location to the target (who acts as the location recipient
      in this transmission). The target may then act as a location server and
      convey this location to a service provider (who acts as location
      recipient in this transmission) to facilitate some location-based
      service.
</p>
<p>(Note that although <a class='info' href='#end-to-end'>Figure&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>End-to-End Location Distribution</span><span>)</span></a> depicts a
      single "path", a single location server may transmit location to
      multiple location recipients over time; groups these paths together
      forms a logical distribution tree, with the location generator as the

<p>This end-to-end model for location distribution gives rise to
      additional security concerns. For example, in a scenario where some
      intermediate location servers are untrusted, a location recipient may
      desire additional assurances that the LO was generated by a trusted LG,
      and not modified by these untrusted entities. In this section, we first
      consider threats and possible attacks against a location object
      throughout its entire life cycle. We then describe the assurances that
      various parties require to mitigate these threats. Finally, we discuss
      possible mechanisms that protocols or location object formats should
      make available to provide such assurances.

Threats to Location Objects</h3>

<p>The major threats to the end-to-end security of location objects
        can be grouped into two categories: First, threats against the
        integrity and authenticity of location objects can expose entities
        that rely on location objects to many types of fraud. Second, threats
        against the confidentiality of location objects can reduce the ability
        of location servers to control access to location.

<a name="rfc.section.5.1.1"></a><h3>5.1.1.&nbsp;
Threats to Location Integrity and Authenticity</h3>

<p>A location object contains four essential types of information:
          Identifiers for the described target, location information,
          time-stamps, and rules. By grouping values of these various types
          together within a single structure, a location object encodes a set
          of bindings among them. That is, the location object asserts that
          the identified target was present at the given location at the given
          time; and that the given rules express the target's desired policy,
          at the given time, for the distribution of his location. Below, we
          provide a set of attacks that a malicious party (e.g. an
          intermediate LS, an eavesdropper on the path between LS and LR, or
          the target himself) might conduct to falsify one or more of the
          bindings asserted by the location object.
</p>
<p>Note that in all cases the target identity provided in a location
          object should be based on an authentication between the target and
          the location generator (e.g. an explicit authentication based on a
          shared secret, or an implicit authentication based on the ability to
          receive a message). Therefore, the identity binding in a received
          location object is only as strong as the authentication between the
          target and the location generator (that is, the location object can
          only attest to the fact that someone at the given location is
          capable of authenticating as the given identity). It is vital to the
          authenticity of location information that this authentication be as
          strong as is feasible in any deployment scenario. However,
          mechanisms within a Geopriv location object or protocol can provide
          no protection from attacks against this authentication mechanism and
          thus we do not explicitly consider such attacks.</p>

              identity assertions in a location object are only as strong as

Threats to Location Privacy</h3>

<p>In the Geopriv model, the privacy of location information is
          protected by the application of privacy rules specified by
          authorized rule makers, and by confidentiality protection en route.
          (For more information on privacy rule enforcement, see <a class='info' href='#priv-sec'>Section&nbsp;3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Privacy rule enforcement</span><span>)</span></a>).) Below, we provide a set of attacks that

</dd>

Required Assurances</h3>

<p>We now describe the assurances required by each party involved in
        location distribution in order to mitigate the attacks described in
        the previous two sections:</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Rule Maker</dt>
<dd>The rule maker is responsible for
            distributing the target's privacy rules to the location servers.
            The primary assurance required by the Rule Maker is thus that the
            binding between the target's privacy rules and the target's
            identity is correctly conveyed to each location server that
            handles the location object. Ensuring the integrity of the privacy
            rules distributed to the location servers prevents rule-tampering
            attacks. (Note that in many circumstances, the privacy policy of
            the target may itself be sensitive information, in these cases the
            Rule Maker also requires the assurance that the binding between
            the target's identity and the target's privacy rules are not
            deducible by anyone other than an authorized location server).
</dd>
<dt>Location Server</dt>
<dd>The Location Server is responsible
            for enforcing the target's privacy policy. The first assurance
            required by the location server is that the binding between the
            target's privacy rules and the target's identity is authentic.
            Authenticating the rule-maker who created the privacy rules
            prevents rule-tampering attacks. The second assurance required by
            the location server is that the binding between the target's
            identity and the target's location are not deducible by any entity
            except as allowed the target's privacy policy. Ensuring the
            confidentiality of these bindings prevents eavesdropping attacks.
            (Note that ensuring the confidentiality of the location object
            also helps to mitigate location-theft and location-identity-theft
            attacks, since it makes it more difficult for an attacker to
            obtain a valid location object to replay.)
</dd>
<dt>Location Recipient</dt>
<dd>The Location Recipient is the end
            consumer of the location object. The location recipient thus
            requires assurances about the authenticity of the bindings between
            the target's location, the target's identity and the time.
            Ensuring the authenticity of these bindings prevents
            place-shifting, time-shifting, location-theft, and
            location-identity-theft attacks; and mitigates location-swapping
            attacks to the greatest possible extent.
</dd>
<dt>Location Generator</dt>
<dd>The Location Generator shares
            responsibility for ensuring that the target's privacy policy is
            enforced. The primary assurance required by the Location Generator
            is that the Location Server to which the Location Object is
            initially published is one that is trusted to enforce the target's
            privacy policy. Authenticating the trusted Location Server
            mitigates the risk of server impersonation attacks. (Additionally,
            in some scenarios, there may be no Location Server which can be
            trusted to sufficiently safe-guard the target's location
            information, in which case the Location Generator may require
            assurance that intermediate location servers are unable to deduce
            the binding between the target's identity and the target's
            location.)

<a name="rfc.section.5.3"></a><h3>5.3.&nbsp;
Protocol mechanisms</h3>

<p>Protocols that carry location can provide strong assurances, but
        only for a single segment of the location object's life cycle. In
        particular, a protocol can provide integrity protection and
        confidentiality for the data exchanged, and mutual authentication of
        the parties involved in the protocol, by using a secure transport such
        as IPsec or TLS.
</p>
<p>Additionally, note that if (1) the protocol provides mutual
        authentication for every segment; and (2) every entity in the location
        distribution exchanges information only with entities with whom it has
        a trust relationship, then entities can transitively obtain assurances
        regarding the origin and ultimate destination of the location object.
        Of course, direct assurances are always preferred over assurances
        requiring transitive trust, since they require fewer assumptions.
</p>
<p>Using protocol mechanisms alone, the entities can receive
        assurances only about a single hop in the distribution chain. For
        example, suppose that an LR retrieves location from an LS over an
        integrity- and confidentiality-protected channel. The LR knows that
        the transmitted LO has not been modified or observed en route.
        However, the assurances provided by the protocol do not guarantee that
        the transmitted LO was not corrupted before it was sent (e.g., by a
        previous LS). Likewise, the LR can verify that the LO was transmitted
        by the LS, but cannot verify the origin of the LO if it is different
        from the LS.
</p>
<p>Security mechanisms in protocols are thus unable to provide direct
        assurances over multiple transmissions of an LO. However, it should be
        noted that the transmission of location "by reference" can be used to
        effectively turn multi-hop paths into single-hop paths. If the
        multiple transmissions of an LO are replaced by multiple transmissions
        of an identifier (a multi-hop dissemination channel), then the LO need
        only traverse a single hop, namely the dereference transaction between
        the LR and the dereference server.

<a name="rfc.section.5.4"></a><h3>5.4.&nbsp;
Mechanisms within the Location Object Format</h3>

<p>Assurances as to the integrity and confidentiality of a location
        object can be provided directly through the location object format.
        Additionally, the location object format can be used to authenticate
        the originator of a location object. In particular, integrity and
        origin authentication can be assured by signing a location object
        (e.g., using S/MIME or XMLSIG), and confidentiality can be assured by
        encrypting the location object using a public encryption key belonging
        to the intended recipient (e.g. using S/MIME). Recipients of location
        objects secured in this fashion can obtain assurance as to the
        integrity and authenticity of the location object even after it has
        been handled by untrusted intermediaries. Similarly, a Location Server
        (or Location Generator) that guarantees confidentiality in this
        fashion can be assured that the location object is protected from
        unauthorized viewing even in the presence of untrusted
        intermediaries.
</p>
<p>Although such direct, end-to-end assurances are desirable, and
        these mechanisms should be used whenever possible, there are many
        deployment scenarios where directly securing a location object is
        impractical. In particular, in some deployment scenarios a direct
        trust relationship may not exist between the creator of the location
        object and the ultimate recipient. Additionally, in a scenario where
        many recipients are authorized to receive a given location object, the
        creator of the location object cannot guarantee end-to-end
        confidentiality without knowing precisely which recipient will receive
        the location object.
</p>
<p>An additional challenge in providing end-to-end authenticity
        guarantees by signing the location object is that in many deployments
        different entities may assert different bindings within the same
        location object. Consider, for example, a scenario where a Location
        Generator produces a location object that asserts a binding between a
        time, a location, and a pseudonym for the target. Additionally, a Rule
        Maker creates a binding between a set of privacy rules and a public
        target identity. A presence server receives the rules binding from
        Rule Maker and the location object from the Location Generator. The
        presence server then generates a new location object binding together
        the time, the location, the public target identity and the privacy
        rules. In such a scenario there is no single entity who can directly
        assert the validity of the entire location object. In such a case, a
        mechanism is needed within the location object format that allows
        multiple originators to jointly assert various components of the
        location object bindings.
