     Abstract 
      
        This memo is a draft revision of the standards track RFC-2670. 
        Please see "Section 9 Changes from RFC2670" for a description of modifications.   
        This document or its successor will obsolete RFC-2670 when accepted. 
      
        This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
        for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
        In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP- 
        based management of DOCSIS compliant Radio Frequency (RF) interfaces. 
      
        This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the 
        SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The set of objects are consistent with the 
        SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.

     1.  The SNMP Management Framework 
      
        The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
        components: 
      
        o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1]. 
      
        o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
            purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of 
            Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 
            16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The 
            second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 
            [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7]. 
      
        o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
            first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
            described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message 
            protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is 
            called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. 
            The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and 
            described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12]. 
      
        o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
            first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
            described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol 
            operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
            [13]. 
      
        o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and 
            the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 
            [15]. 
      
        A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework 
        can be found in RFC 2570 [21]. 
      
        Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
        the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
        defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
      
        This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A 
        MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
        translations. The resulting translated MIB MUST be semantically 
        equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
        translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable 
        information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
        SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine 
        readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the 
        MIB.

     2.  Glossary 
      
        The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable 
        system usage, or from the documents associated with the Data Over 
        Cable Service Interface Specification process. 
      
     2.1.  CATV 
      
        Originally "Community Antenna Television", now used to refer to any 
        cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals 
        to a community. 
      
     2.2.  Channel 
      
        A specific frequency allocation with an RF medium, specified by 
        channel width in Hertz (cycles per second) and by center frequency. 
        Within the US Cable Systems, upstream channels are generally 
        allocated from the 5-42MHz range while down stream channels are 
        generally allocated from the 50-750MHz range depending on the 
        capabilities of the given system.  The typical broadcast channel 
        width in the US is 6MHz.  Upstream channel widths for DOCSIS vary. 
      
        For European cable systems, upstream channels vary by country. The 
        upper edge of upstream channel allocations vary between 25 MHz to 65 
        MHz, and the lower edge of downstream channel allocations vary 
        between 47 MHz and 87.5 MHz. The typical broadcast channel width in 
        Europe is 8MHz. The actual parameters are of concern to systems 
        deploying EuroDOCSIS technology. 
      
     2.3.  CM   Cable Modem. 
      
        A CM acts as a "slave" station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data 
        system. 
      
     2.4.  CMTS   Cable Modem Termination System. 
      
        A generic term covering a cable bridge or cable router in a head-end. 
        A CMTS acts as the master station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data 
        system.  It is the only station that transmits downstream, and it 
        controls the scheduling of upstream transmissions by its associated 
        CMs. 
      
     2.5.  Codeword 
      
        See [25]. A characteristic of the Forward Error Correction scheme used 
        above the RF media layer. 
      
     2.6.  Data Packet 
      
        The payload portion of the MAC Packet.

        ITU-T J.112 Annex B standard for cable modem systems [20]. 
      
     2.9.  Downstream 
      
        The direction from the head-end towards the subscriber. 
      
     2.10.  Head-end 
      
        The origination point in most cable systems of the subscriber video 
        signals. 
      
     2.11.  MAC Packet 
      
        A DOCSIS PDU. 
      
     2.12.  MCNS 
      
        "Multimedia Cable Network System".  Generally replaced in usage by 
        DOCSIS. 
      
     2.13.  Mini-slot 
      
        See [25].  In general, an interval of time which is allocated by the 
        CMTS to a given CM for that CM to transmit in an upstream direction. 
      
     2.14.  QPSK   Quadrature Phase Shift Keying. 
      
        A particular modulation scheme on an RF medium. See [19].

        The direction from the subscriber towards the head-end. 
      
     3.  Overview 
      
        This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of 
        MCNS/DOCSIS compliant Cable Modem (CM) and Cable Modem Termination 
        System (CMTS) RF interfaces.  The specification is derived in part 
        from the parameters and protocols described in DOCSIS Radio Frequency 
        Interface Specification [25]. 
      
     3.1.  Structure of the MIB 
      
        This MIB is structured as three groups: 
      
        o    Management information pertinent to both Cable Modems (CM) and 
             Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS) (docsIfBaseObjects). 
      
        o    Management information pertinent to Cable Modems only 
             (docsIfCmObjects). 
      
        o    Management information pertinent to Cable Modem Termination 
             Systems only (docsIfCmtsObjects). 
      
        Tables within each of these groups group objects functionally - e.g. 
        Quality of Service, Channel characteristics, MAC layer management, 
        etc.  Rows created automatically (e.g. by the device according to the 
        hardware configuration) may and generally will have a mixture of 
        configuration and status objects within them.  Rows that are meant to 
        be created by the management station are generally restricted to 
        configuration (read-create) objects. 
      
     3.1.1.  docsIfBaseObjects 
      
        docsIfDownstreamChannelTable - This table describes the active 
        downstream channels for a CMTS and the received downstream channel 
        for a CM. 
      
        docsIfUpstreamChannelTable - This table describes the active upstream 
        channels for a CMTS and the current upstream transmission channel 
        for a CM. 
      
        docsIfQosProfileTable - This table describes the valid Quality of 
        Service profiles for the cable data system. 
      
        docsIfSignalQualityTable - This table is used to monitor RF signal 
        quality characteristics of received signals. 
      
        docsIfDocsisBaseCapability  - This object is used to indicate the highest level       
        of DOCSIS version a cable device can support.

     3.1.2.  docsIfCmObjects 
      
        docsIfCmMacTable - This table is used to monitor the DOCSIS MAC 
        interface and can be considered an extension to the ifEntry. 
      
        docsIfCmServiceTable - This table describes the upstream service 
        queues available at this CM.  There is a comparable table at the 
        CMTS, docsIfCmtsServiceEntry, which describes the service queues from 
        the point of view of the CMTS. 
      
     3.1.3.  docsIfCmtsObjects 
      
        docsIfCmtsStatusTable - This table provides a set of aggregated 
        counters which roll-up values and events that occur on the underlying 
        sub-interfaces. 
      
        docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable - This table is used to hold information 
        about known (i.e. ranging, registered, and/or previously online)  
        cable modems on the system serviced by this CMTS. 
      
        docsIfCmtsServiceEntry - This table provides access to the 
        information related to upstream service queues. 
      
        docsIfCmtsModulationTable - This table allows control over the 
        modulation profiles for RF channels associated with this CMTS. 
      
        docsIfCmtsMacToCmTable - This table allows fast access into the 
        docsIfCmtsCmTable via a MAC address (of the CM) interface. 
      
     3.2.  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB 
      
        This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB to the Interfaces 
        MIB [17].  Several areas of correlation are addressed in the 
        following subsections.  The implementer is referred to the Interfaces 
        MIB document in order to understand the general intent of these 
        areas. 
      
     3.2.1.  Layering Model 
      
        An instance of ifEntry exists for each RF Downstream interface, for 
        each RF Upstream interface, for each Upstream logical Channel and for  
        each RF MAC layer.   
        The ifStackTable [17] MUST be implemented to identify relationships among 
        sub-interfaces. 
      
        The following example illustrates a CMTS MAC interface with one downstream 
        and two upstream interfaces.

        As can be seen from this example, the RF MAC interface is layered on 
        top of the downstream and upstream interfaces, and the RF Upstream interface 
        is layered on top of an Upstream Logical Channels.   
      
        In this example, the assignment of index values could be as follows: 
      
        ifIndex       ifType                     Description

           5    docsCableUpstream(129)           CATV Upstream interface

           9    docsCableUpstreamChannel(205)    CATV Upstream Channel 
      
      
           The corresponding ifStack entries would then be: 
      
                | IfStackHigherLayer | ifStackLowerLayer | 
                |         0          |         2         |

        The same interface model can also be used in Telephony or Telco 
        Return systems.  A pure Telco Return system (Cable Modem as well as 
        Cable Modem Termination System) would not have upstream, but only 
        downstream cable channels.  Systems supporting both Telco Return and 
        cable upstream channels can use the above model without modification.

     5.  Acknowledgments 
          This document is a production of the Docsis 2.0 OSS Working Group. 
          It is a revision based on RFC2670, "Radio Frequency (RF) Interface  
          Management Information Base for DOCSIS compliant RF interfaces" [22]. 
      
          The current editors wish to express gratitude to Rich Prodan, Greg 
          Nakanishi, Rich Woundy, Eduardo Cardona, and Adi Shaliv for their 
          valued advice and opinions. 
           
      
     6.  Revision History 
      
     6.1. Scope 
      
          This MIB in this document has been developed to accommodate DOCSIS 2.0 devices  
          and their system capabilities. The MIB is an update to RFC2670 with the 
          additional incorporation of EuroDocsis specific items and the DOCS_IF_EXT mib.  
      
     6.2. Extension 
      
         We have maintained the MIB objects as defined in RFC 2670. In some cases new mib 
         objects have been created with identical functionality but greater capacity (ie 
         32 to 64 bits). In these situations, both the original 32 bit objects and the new 
         64 bit objects must be implemented.

     8.  Security Considerations 
      
        This MIB relates to a system which will provide metropolitan public 
         internet access.  As such, improper manipulation of the objects 
         represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a large 
         number of end-users.  In addition, manipulation of the 
         docsIfCmServiceQosProfile, docsIfCmtsServerQosProfile, and the 
         elements of docsIfQosProfileTable and docsIfCmtsModulationTable may 
         allow an end-user to improve their service response or diminish other 
         subscriber's service response.

     Internet Draft             DOCSIS RF Interface MIB              November 2001 
      
      
         There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
         have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
         objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
         environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
         environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
         network operations. 
      
         SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network 
         itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no 
         control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
         GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
      
         It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
         features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use 
         of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View- based 
         Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended. 
      
         It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
         entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
         configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
         (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
         (change/create/delete) them. 
      
      
     9.  Changes from RFC2670 
           
          Upstream now separated into 'physical interfaces' and 'logical channels'. An 
          instance of the docsIfUpstreamChannelTable exists for each 'logical channel'. 
          The IANA ifType for 'logical channels' is 205. The IANA ifType for 'physical 
          interfaces' remains at 129. 
           
          Object docsIfDownChannelAnnex added to docsIfDownstreamChannelTable. This object 
          originated in the EuroDocsis specifications. 
           
          Five new objects added to the docsIfUpstreamChannelTable. One describes the 
          channel type in use, while four are specific S-CDMA parameters. 
           
          Object docsIfQosProfMaxTransmitBurst has been added to the docsIfQosProfileTable 
          to replace deprecated object docsIfQosProfMaxTxBurst. This fixes a range error 
          caused by switch to recording as bytes instead of minislots. 
           
          A new base object docsIfDocsisBaseCapability has been added which mirrors the 
          functionality of the docsifExt mib object docsIfDocsisCapability, extended to 
          include Docsis 2.0. 
           
          Two new objects added to the docsIfCmStatusTable. One indicates the current 
          modulation type, while the other mirrors the functionality of the docsIfExt 
          object docsIfDocsisOperMode. 
           
          Two new 64 bit counters added to the docsIfCmServiceTable to extend the capacity 
          of existing 32 bit counters.

     Internet Draft             DOCSIS RF Interface MIB              November 2001 
      
           
          Seven new objects added to the docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable. Three are 64 bit 
          counters, two add ipv6 capability, one mirrors a docsIfExt object (extended to 
          include Docsis 2.0), and one indicates the CM modulation type in use. 
           
          One object added to the docsIfCmtsServiceTable to fix a range error in an 
          existing object, that has been deprecated. 
           
          Eight new objects added to the docsIfCmtsModulationTable. Seven of these 
          describe ATDMA/S-CDMA channel parameters, while the other describes modulation 
          attributes common to all modulation types. 
           
          Enumerated values for object docsIfDownChannelInterleave have been expanded to 
          include a EuroDocsis value. 
           
          Enumerated values for object docsIfCmtsModIntervalUsageCode have been expanded 
          to include new Docsis 2.0 values. 
           
          Enumerated values for object docsIfCmtsModType have been expanded to include new 
          Docsis 2.0 values. 
           
          Compliance statements have been updated to reflect new objects and to describe 
          EuroDocsis specific implementation features.
