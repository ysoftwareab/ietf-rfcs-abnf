                Segmented MVPN Using IP Lookup for BIER
                    draft-xie-bier-mvpn-segmented-02

Abstract

   This document specifies an alternative of the control plane and data
   plane procedures that allow segmented MVPN using BIER.  It allows the
   use of the more efficient LIR-pF explicit-tracking for segmented MVPN
   deployment when BIER is used as the upstream or downstream segments.
   It requires a segmentation point BFR doing an IP header lookup, which
   is common for the forwarding procedure on BFER, or the forwarding
   procedure on ABR with local VPN CEs connected.  This document updates
   [I-D.ietf-bier-mvpn].

1.  Introduction

   When using BIER to transport an MVPN data packet through a BIER
   domain, an ingress PE functions as a BFIR (see [RFC8279]).  The BFIR
   must determine the set of BFERs to which the packet needs to be
   delivered.  This can be done through an explicit-tracking function
   using a LIR and/or LIR-pF flag in BGP MVPN routes, per the

   [RFC6513],[RFC6514],[RFC6625],[I-D.ietf-bess-mvpn-expl-track], and
   [I-D.ietf-bier-mvpn].

   Using a LIR-pF Flag will bring some extra benefits, as [I-D.ietf-
   bier-mvpn] and [I-D.ietf-bess-mvpn-expl-track] have stated.  But
   unfortunately, the LIR-pF explicit tracking for a segmented MVPN
   deployment is not allowed in the current draft [I-D.ietf-bier-mvpn],
   because the draft requires a per-flow upstream-assigned label to do
   the data-plane per-flow lookup on the segmentation point BFR.

   This document specifies an alternative of the control plane and data
   plane procedures that allow segmented MVPN using BIER in both
   segments.  This allows the use of the more efficient LIR-pF explicit-
   tracking as the BIER overlay, with a slight change in the forwarding
   procedure of a segmentation point BFR by using IP lookup.  This will
   bring some significant benefits to the segmented MVPN deployment,
   including:

   o  Getting a much better multicast join latency by eliminating the
      round trip interaction of S-PMSI AD routes and Leaf AD routes.
      Especially, the S-PMSI A-D routes may need a data-driven procedure
      to trigger, and make the multicast join latency even worse.

   o  Greatly reducing the number of S-PMSI A-D routes that BFIR and
      BFERs need to save.

   o  Consolidated forwarding procedure of IP lookup for every BIER
      Overlay functioning routers, such as BFIR, BFER, segmentation
      point BFR, and segmentation point BFR with BFER function.

2.  Terminology

   Readers of this document are assumed to be familiar with the
   terminology and concepts of the documents listed as Normative
   References.

3.  Problem Statement and Considerations

3.1.  Problem Statement

   BIER is a stateless multicast forwarding by introducing a multicast-
   specific BIER header in the data plane.  The maximal number of BFERs
   a packet can reach is limited by the bit string length of a BIER
   header.  For a network with many routers in multiple IGP areas
   (typically an Inter-Area network), it may be more expected to use a
   segmented MVPN when deploying BIER than traditional MVPN.

Internet-Draft      draft-xie-bier-mvpn-segmented-00         August 2018


   However, it is not allowed in the [I-D.ietf-bier-mvpn] to use a LIR-
   pF explicit-tracking when deploying a segmented MVPN.  This will lead
   to a low efficiency of explicit-tracking, and cause a worse multicast
   join latency.  Here we take a scenario of inter-area segmented MVPN
   with both segments using BIER as an example.

3.2.  Considerations

   A BFIR is always needed to know the BFERs interested in a specific
   flow.  This is a function of a BIER overlay defined in [RFC8279].  A
   segmentation point BFR in a segmented MVPN deployment, saying ABR,
   will play similar roles of both BFIR and BFER.  It needs to do a
   disposition of a BIER Header, and then do an imposition of a new BIER
   Header.  It requires the ABR router to maintain per-flow states, and
   especially, such per-flow states always include a set of BFERs who
   are intrested in a specific flow by using an explicit-tracking
   procedure.

   This behavior is completely different from a traditional segmented
   MVPN deployment, e.g, with both of the two segments using P2MP label
   switch.

   In a traditional segmented MVPN with both segments using P2MP label
   switch, it is expected to receive a MPLS packet and replicate to
   downstream routers after swap the MPLS Label.  A lookup of IP packet
   is not expected.  Also, in a traditional segmented MVPN deployment,
   an MPLS label represents a P-tunnel, which may carry one, many or
   even all multicast flow(s) of a VPN, so it is not always a per-flow
   state on the segmentation point router.

   In conclusion, the pattern of forwarding packets on segmentation
   points only by lookup of MPLS label mapped from multicast flow(s) is
   significantly unnecessary when BIER is introduced.  Instead, doing a
   per-flow lookup of IP header on segmentation points is more efficient
   and consolidated.

4.  Upstream BIER and Downstream BIER

4.1.  Explicit Tracking using LIR-pF

   In a scenario of Inter-area Segmented MVPN with both segments using
   BIER, the determination of the set of BFERs that need to receive a
   specific multicast flow of (C-S1,C-G1) in each segment, can be
   obtained by using a LIR-pF flag.

   Suppose a topology of this:

       (Ingress PE)PE1-------P1-------ABR-------P2------PE2(Egress PE)
                   |                  |                 |
                   |   Ingress Area   |   Egress Area   |
                   |  ( BIER SD<X> )  |  ( BIER SD<Y> ) |

                        Figure 1: Example topology

   PE1 is Ingress PE, and the area of { PE1 -- P1 -- ABR } is called an
   Ingress Area.

   PE2 is Egress PE, and the area of { ABR -- P2 -- PE2 } is called an
   Egress Area.

   The Ingress PE is configured to use a BIER tunnel type for a MVPN
   instance for the Ingress Area, and the ABR is configured to use a
   BIER tunnel type for the MVPN instance for the Egress Area.

   The Ingress PE originates a wildcard S-PMSI A-D route (C-*,C-*) and
   the PTA of that route has the following settings:

   o  The LIR-pF and LIR flags be set.

   o  The tunnel type be set to "BIER".

   o  A non-zero MPLS label be specified.

   ABR receives the S-PMSI A-D route from the Ingress PE, and re-
   advertises the route to the Egress PE, with a PTA type "BIER", and
   PTA flags of LIR and LIR-pF, and a new non-zero upstream-assigned
   MPLS label allocated by ABR per-VPN.

   Egress PE receives the S-PMSI A-D route from the ABR, and checks if
   it need to response with a Leaf A-D route to this S-PMSI A-D route
   using the process of the "match for reception" and "match for
   tracking" as defined in [I-D.bess-mvpn-expl-track].  In this example,
   for a C-flow of (C-S1, C-G1), the checking result of "matched for
   tracking" is the S-PMSI(C-*, C-*), and the checking result of
   "matched for reception" is also the S-PMSI(C-*, C-*).  Egress PE will
   then send a Leaf A-D route (RD, C-S1, C-G1, Root=PE1, Leaf=PE2) to
   the ABR with a PTA flag LIR-pF, and a Leaf A-D route (RD, C-*, C-*,
   Root=PE1, Leaf=PE2) without a PTA flag LIR-pF.

   ABR then has an explicit-tracking result of a new per-flow
   information of (RD, C-S1, C-G1, Root=PE1) with Egress PE as its leaf
   or BFER.  ABR's "matched for tracking" result to this flow(RD, C-S1,
   C-G1, PE1) will then be updated with a new record, and ABR then sends
   a Leaf A-D route (RD, C-S1, C-G1, Root=PE1, Leaf=ABR) to Ingress PE.

   Ingress PE then has an explicit-tracking result of a new per-flow
   information of (RD, C-S1, C-G1, Root=PE1) with ABR as its leaf or
   BFER.

   From this procedure description one can see that:

   1.  The S-PMSI A-D(C-*, C-*) route is functioning as a per-VPN anchor
       of the upstream and the downstream(s), which can be called an
       MVPN FEC in this document, saying MVPN FEC(*,*).

   2.  The Leaf A-D(S,G) routes are functioning as a per-flow anchor of
       the downstream(s) and the upstream, which are also MVPN FECs
       accordingly, saying MVPN FEC(S,G).

   3.  The Tuple of (Root=PE1, RD) in S-PMSI (C-*, C-*) or Leaf AD(C-*,
       C-*) or Leaf AD(C-S, C-G) represents an VRF on the ABR
       implicitly.

   ABR knows the per-vpn infmation of a (Root=PE1, RD) tuple when
   receiving and re-advertising the S-PMSI A-D(*,*) route bound with a
   PTA, where:

   o  Inbound SD (InSD): in PTA of the received S-PMSI(*,*) route.

   o  Inbound VpnLabel (InVpnLabel): in PTA of the received S-PMSI(*,*)
      route.

   o  Inbound BfirId (InBfirId): in PTA of the received S-PMSI(*,*)
      route.

   o  Outbound SD(OutSD): in PTA of the re-advertised S-PMSI(*,*) route.

   o  Outbound VpnLabel (OutVpnLabel): in PTA of the re-advertised
      S-PMSI(*,*) route.

   o  Outbound BfirId (OutBfirId): in PTA of the re-advertised
      S-PMSI(*,*) route.

   ABR establishs a per-flow control-plane state accordingly like this:

   o  Per-flow upstream state, according to the Leaf A-D (C-S, C-G)
      route send to the Ingress PE: (PE1, RD, C-S1, C-G1, InSD,
      InBfirId, InVpnLabel).

   o  Per-flow downstream state(s), according to the Leaf A-D(C-S, C-G)
      route(s) received by the ABR from Egress PE(s): (PE1, RD, C-S1,
      C-G1, Leaf, OutSD, OutBfirId, OutVpnLabel).

   ABR knows the BIER Label(s) it allocated for InSD and OutSD, saying
   InBierLabel for InSD<X> and OutBierLabel for OutSD<Y>, and thus it
   can establish the per-flow forwarding state:

   o  Per-flow upstream forwarding state: (InBierLabel, InBfirId,
      InVpnLabel, C-S1, C-G1).

   o  Per-flow downstream(s) forwarding state: (InBierLabel, InBfirId,
      InVpnLabel, C-S1, C-G1, Leaf, OutBfirId, OutVpnLabel,
      OutBitString)

4.2.  Forwarding using IP lookup on Segmentation Point

   The Forwarding procedure of a segmentation point, ABR, have the
   following steps:

   1.  Need to do a disposition of BIER encapsulation, and a upstream-
       assigned VpnLabel lookup in the special context to get the
       appropriate VPN represented by Ingress PE's IP and RD.

   2.  Need to do a imposition of BIER by an IP lookup to get the
       appropriate BIER encapsulation for Area<Y>.

   3.  Optionally the same disposition of BIER encapsulation and IP
       lookup are also required on ABR if ABR has local VPN CEs.

   For Step 1 and step 2, One can think them as one-to-many swapping of
   a big 'BIER header' instead of a small 'Label' in P2MP case:

   o  swapping the InBierLabel with an OutBierLabel.

   o  swapping the InBfirId with an OutBfirId.

   o  swapping the InVpnLabel with an OutVpnLabel.

   o  swapping the InBitString with an OutBitString.

   The key of a per-flow lookup on ABR is a tuple of (InBierLabel,
   InBfirId, InVpnLabel) and a tuple of (C-S1, C-G1), representing a VRF
   and a flow respectively.  All the elements are from a BIER packet,
   and such an IP lookup can be seen the same as an MFIB lookup, if the
   (InBierLabel, InBfirId, InVpnLabel) tuple is mapped to a VRF locally
   on the ABR.

5.  Upstream P2MP/IR and Downstream BIER

5.1.  Explicit Tracking using LIR-pF

   The procedures described in chapter 4.1 is also suitable for this
   case, provided the LIR-pF explicit-tracking is used appropriately.

   Suppose a topology of this:

                                      |  Egress Area<Z>  |
                                      |    (P2MP/IR)     |
                                      |                  |
                                        +-------P3------PE3(Egress PE)
                                       /
       (Ingress PE)PE1-------P1-------ABR
                   |                   \
                   |                    +-------P2------PE2(Egress PE)
                   |                  |                  |
                   | Ingress Area<X>  |  Egress Area<Y>  |
                   |   ( P2MP/IR )    |  ( BIER SD<Y> )  |

                        Figure 2: Example topology

   The Ingress PE is configured to use a P2MP or IR tunnel type for a
   MVPN instance for the Ingress Area<X>, and the ABR is configured to
   use a BIER tunnel type for the MVPN instance for the Egress Area <Y>,
   and ABR may be configured to use a P2MP or IR tunnel type for another
   Egress Area<Z>.

   Example 1: Use Inclusive P-tunnel for traditional areas.

   PE1 may configure to use one SPMSI (*,*,PTA<mLDP, Flag=LIR+LIRpF>)
   route , for one Unidirectional Inclusive mLDP P2MP tunnel.

   ABR may configure to reflect only the SPMSI(*,*) route with the PTA
   type changed to BIER for Area<Y>, and reflect the SPMSI(*,*) route
   with the PTA type changed to mLDP, RSVP-TE or IR for Area<Z>.

   Example 2: Use Selective P-tunnel for traditional areas.

   PE1 may configure to use one SPMSI (*,*,PTA<mLDP, Flag=LIR+LIRpF>)
   route and one to many SPMSI (S,G,PTA<mLDP, Flag=LIR+LIFpF>) routes,
   for one Unidirectional Inclusive mLDP P2MP tunnel and one to many
   Selective mLDP P2MP tunnels respectively.

   ABR may configure to reflect only the SPMSI(*,*) route with the PTA
   type changed to BIER for Area<Y>, and reflect the SPMSI(*,*) route

   and SPMSI(S,G) routes with the PTA type changed to mLDP, RSVP-TE or
   IR for Area<Z>.

5.2.  Forwarding using IP lookup on Segmentation Point

   The Forwarding procedure of a segmentation point, ABR, have 3
   conditions:

   1.  Need to do an P2MP MPLS switching for Area<Z>, and this does not
       change.

   2.  Need to do a disposition of P2MP or IR tunnel, and a following IP
       lookup to get the appropriate BIER encapsulation for Area<Y>.

   3.  Need to do the same IP lookup to get the appropriate local VRF
       interfaces if ABR has local VPN CEs.

6.  Upstream BIER and Downstream P2MP/IR

6.1.  Explicit Tracking using LIR-pF

   The procedures described in chapter 4.1 is also suitable for this
   case, provided the LIR-pF explicit-tracking is used appropriately.

   Suppose a topology of this:

                                      |  Egress Area<Z>  |

                        Figure 3: Example topology

   The Ingress PE is configured to use a BIER tunnel type for a MVPN
   instance for the Ingress Area<X>, and the ABR is configured to use a
   BIER tunnel type for the MVPN instance for the Egress Area <Y>, and
   ABR may be configured to use a P2MP or IR tunnel type for another
   Egress Area<Z>.

   Example 1: Use Inclusive P-tunnel for traditional areas.

   PE1 may configure to use one SPMSI (*,*,PTA<BIER, Flag=LIR+LIRpF>)
   route , for one BIER tunnel.

   ABR may configure to reflect only the SPMSI(*,*) route with the PTA
   type unchanged for Area<Y>, and reflect the SPMSI(*,*) route with the
   PTA type changed to mLDP, RSVP-TE or IR for Area<Z>.

   Example 2: Use Selective P-tunnel for traditional areas.

   PE1 may configure to use one SPMSI (*,*,PTA<BIER, Flag=LIR+LIRpF>)
   route and one to many SPMSI (S,G,PTA<BIER, Flag=LIR+LIFpF>) routes.
   They include the same one BIER tunnel, but the many SPMSI(S,G) routes
   can initialize the many Inter-area MVPN FECs, and thus enable the ABR
   to initialize many SPMSI tunnels for Area<Z>.  The ABR need to
   support allocating SPMSI tunnels for Area<Z> per the upstream SD<X>
   and the (S,G).

   ABR may configure to reflect only the SPMSI(*,*) route with the PTA
   type changed to BIER for Area<Y>, and reflect the SPMSI(*,*) route
   and SPMSI(S,G) routes with the PTA type changed to mLDP, RSVP-TE or
   IR for Area<Z>.

6.2.  Forwarding using IP lookup on Segmentation Point

   The Forwarding procedure of a segmentation point, ABR, have the
   following conditions:

   1.  Need to do a disposition of BIER encapsulation, and an upstream-
       assigned VpnLabel lookup in the special context to get the
       appropriate VPN represented by Ingress PE's IP and RD.

   2.  Need to do an imposition of BIER by an IP lookup to get the
       appropriate BIER encapsulation for Area<Y>.

   3.  Need to do an imposition of P2MP by an IP lookup to get the
       appropriate P2MP downstreams.

   4.  Optionally the same disposition of BIER encapsulation and IP
       lookup are also required on ABR if ABR has local VPN CEs.

7.  Summary and Recommendations

   Traditional P2MP forwarding on an router can be simple if it is not
   the Bud router case.  Only a one shot Label lookup is enough to get
   the outgoing P2MP interfaces to replicate.  The same benefit is also
   available by a pure 'ABR' node for segmented MVPN scenario.

   But for a Bud router, the forwarding of an MPLS P2MP packet must
   include a label lookup to find the outgoing P2MP interfaces, and a
   further IP lookup for the local overlay forwarding.  The same
   challenge is same to a ABR node who has local VPN CEs connected.

   For a segmented MVPN deployment with BIER, there are much more
   ingredients different from the simple P2MP label lookup and swap.
   This is because the BIER label is indicating a BIER layer aggregrated
   tunnel for all flows, while the further disposition or imposition
   have to do an overlay lookup.  The benefits of insisting on Label
   lookup, including the per-flow upstream-assigned VpnLabel lookup, on
   a boundary router forwarding procedure is relatively low when BIER is
   used on the upstream segment or downstream segments of the boundary
   router, unless the boundary router is unable to do such an IP lookup.
   This capability of IP lookup after BIER disposition is basic for BFER
   handling, and for case when the ABR has local VPN CEs connected.

   Recommendations are:

   1.  that implementations support the IP lookup for Segmented BIER
       MVPN if it support BFER function which require a disposition of
       BIER header and a further IP lookup.

   2.  that implementations support the LIR-pF explicit tracking for
       Segmented BIER MVPN if it support LIR-pF explicit tracking for
       intra-area MVPN.

   3.  that implementations support the IP lookup and LIR-pF explicit
       tracking for Segmented BIER MVPN if one want to gain better
       multicast join latency and flood less SPMSI(S,G) routes to every
       ABRs and PEs in segmented MVPN deployment.

8.  Security Considerations

   The procedures of this document do not, in themselves, provide
   privacy, integrity, or authentication for the control plane or the
   data plane.

9.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA allocation is required.

   TBD.
