Abstract

   This document describes mechanisms to achieve the high 
   availability of the service function chains. This document
   considers the high availability in the perspective of entire chain.
   This means the SFC control plane needs to take into account some 
   metrics related service chain in addition to individual service  
   functions. This document covers both stateless and stateful service
   functions as well.

1. Introduction

   Service function chaining currently is redesigned with the support
   of the software-defined network (SDN) and network function 
   virtualization (NFV) which provide more flexible and dynamical 
   end-to-end services. 
   
   In order to ensure the high availability of service function 
   chains, some traditional mechanisms for individual service function
   are reused (e.g. Active/Standby or Active/Active). These mechanisms
   are based on the deployment of the backup or redundant service 
   functions. The recovery of whole service chain relies on the 
   recovery of individual service function. 
   
   This document describe a mechanism which ensure the high 
   availability of service chain based on some metrics of whole chain. 
   The mechanism also considers both stateless and stateful service
   functions in the chain.

3. High availability architecture of SFC
	
	Figure 1. shows the architecture for achieving the high 
	availability of the SFC. We make assumptions that each service 
    function has several instances which are connected to different 
	service function forwarders (SFF). Each service function path (SFP)
	is created by the combination of different service instances of 
	different service functions. We propose a new entity called SFC 
    HA manager which is responsible for monitoring metrics which belong
	not only to the individual service functions, such as fail-over, 
	load condition, but also the whole service chain, such as, latency,
	total load, and traffic engineering. The SFC HA Manager takes 
	responsibilities of making the backup SFPs. SFC HA manager should 
	be located in the control plane part [I-D.ietf-sfc-control-plane] 
	of SFC architecture

3.1. Metrics for back-up SFPs
    
	Some metrics for whole service function chain are listed below:
	
	Fail-over: a back-up SFP with the replacement of failed service 
	functions
	
	Total latency: a back-up SFP with better latency 
	
	Total bandwidth: a back-up SFP with highest bandwidth
	
	Total path: a back-up SFP with shortest path
	
	Total load: a back-up SFP with the lowest load
	
	Traffic engineering: a back-up SFP with the pre-defined traffic 
	engineering goals

3.2 SFP with all stateless service functions
    
	Procedures for making a back-up service function path
	
	+ Gather and monitor the states of current service function paths
	+ Evaluate the current SFPs based on collected data and above
	  metrics
	+ HA manager makes back-up SFPs for current SFP
	+ When a critical event occurs, the back-up SFP can be invoked and 
	  replace the current SFP.
    + The information about new SFP (back-up) is updated to all 
	  corresponding SFFs.

3.3 SFP with stateful service funtions

    Procedures for making a back-up service function path
	
	+ Gather and monitor the states of current service function paths
	+ Evaluate the current SFPs based on collected data and above
	  metrics
	+ HA manager makes back-up SFPs for current SFP
		- For stateful service functions in the SFP, internal state
		  management for each service function is required and
		  synchronized with the same kind of service function when
		  creating a back-up SFP
		- State synchronization can be handled by the direct 
		  communication between two same kind service functions
		  
	+ When a critical event occurs, the back-up SFP can be invoked and 
	  replace the current SFP.
    + The information about new SFP (back-up) is updated to all 
	  corresponding SFFs.
