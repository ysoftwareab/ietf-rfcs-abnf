0.  Abstract

   This document describes a the telnet encryption option as a generic
   method of providing data confidentiaility services of the telnet data
   stream.   While this document summarizes currently utilized encrytion
   types and codesit does not define a specific encryption algorithm.
   Separate documents are to be published defining each encryption algo-
   rithms.

2.  Command Meanings

   IAC WILL ENCRYPT

      The sender of this command is willing to send encrypted data.

   IAC WONT ENCRYPT

      The sender of this command refuses to send encrypted data.

   IAC DO ENCRYPT

      The sender of this command is willing to receive encrypted data.

   IAC DONT ENCRYPT

      The sender of this command refuses to accept encrypted data.

   IAC SB ENCRYPT SUPPORT encryption-type-list IAC SE

      The sender of this command is stating what types of encryption it
      will support.  Only the side of the connection that is DO ENCRYPT
      may send the SUPPORT command.  The current types of encryption are
      listed in the current version of the Assigned Numbers document[1].

   IAC SB ENCRYPT IS encryption-type ... IAC SE

      The sender of this command is stating what type of encryption to
      use, and any initial data that is needed.  Only the side of the
      connection that is WILL ENCRYPT may send the IS command.  to ini-
      tialize the encryption-type scheme.

   IAC SB ENCRYPT REPLY encryption-type ... IAC SE

      The sender of this command is continuing the initial data exchange
      that is needed to initialize the encryption-type scheme.  Only the

      mand.

   IAC SB ENCRYPT START keyid IAC SE

      The sender of this command is stating that at this point in the
      data stream, all following data will be encrypted, via the previ-
      ously negotiated method of data encryption.  Only the side of the
      connection that is WILL ENCRYPT may send the START command.

      The keyid is a variable length field.  It is my be used by various
      encryption mechanisms to identify which encryption key is to be
      used, when multiple encryption keys might be known on either side
      of the connection.  The keyid field is encoded with the most sig-
      nificant byte first, and a keyid value of zero is reserved to in-
      dicate the default encryption key (this would typically be an en-
      cryption key derived during authentication, with the AUTHENTICA-
      TION option).  The keyid field must be at least one byte long.
      The only valid values for "keyid" will be those that have been re-
      ceived in a DEC_KEYID command.

   IAC SB ENCRYPT END IAC SE

      The sender of this command is stating that at this point in the
      data stream, all following data will no longer be encrypted.  Only
      the side of the connection that is WILL ENCRYPT may send the END
      command.

   IAC SB ENCRYPT REQUEST-START keyid IAC SE

      The sender of this command requests that the remote side begin en-
      cryption of the telnet data stream.  Only the side of the connec-
      tion that is DO ENCRYPT may send the REQUEST-START command.  The
      keyid is only advisory, and my be omitted.

   IAC SB ENCRYPT REQUEST-END IAC SE

      The sender of this command requests that the remote side stop en-
      cryption of the telnet data stream.  Only the side of the connec-
      tion that is DO ENCRYPT may send the REQUEST-END command.

   IAC SB ENCRYPT ENC_KEYID keyid IAC SE

      The sender of this requests that the remote side verify that
      "keyid" maps to a valid key on the remote side; or verifies that
      the "keyid" received in a DEC_KEYID command is valid.  If keyid is
      omitted, it implies that there are no more known keyids, and that
      the attempt to find a common keyid has failed.  Only the side of
      the connection that is WILL ENCRYPT may send the ENC_KEYID com-
      mand.

      The sender of this requests that the remote side verify that
      "keyid" maps to a valid key on the remote side; or verifies that
      the "keyid" received in a ENC_KEYID command is valid.  If keyid is
      omitted, it implies that there are no more known keyids, and that
      the attempt to find a common keyid has failed.  Only the side of

3.  Default Specification

   The default specification for this option is

      WONT ENCRYPT
      DONT ENCRYPT

   meaning there will not be any encryption of the Telnet data stream.

4.  Motivation

   The Telnet protocol has no form of protection from some intervening
   gateway looking at IP packets as they travel through the network.
   This is especially dangerous when passwords are sent as clear text
   over the network.  This option provides a method for encrypting the
   data stream.

5.  Implementation Rules

   Once the Encryption option is in effect, all data, including TELNET
   options, are encrypted.  Encryption begins with the octet of data im-
   mediately following the "IAC SB ENCRYPT START encryption-type IAC SE"
   command.  Encryption ends after the "IAC SB ENCRYPT END IAC SE" com-
   mand.

   WILL and DO are used only at the beginning of the connection to ob-
   tain and grant permission for future negotiations.  The ENCRYPT op-
   tion must be negotiated in both directions.

   Once the two hosts have exchanged a WILL and a DO, the sender of the
   DO ENCRYPT must send a ENCRYPT SUPPORT command to let the remote side
   know what types of encryption it is willing to accept.  In the re-
   quest, a list of supported encryption schemes is sent.  Only the
   sender of the DO may send a list of supported encryption types (IAC
   SB ENCRYPT SUPPORT encryption-type-list IAC SE).  Only the sender of
   the WILL may actually transmit encrypted data.  This is initiated via
   the "IAC SB ENCRYPT START IAC SE" command, and terminated via the

Internet-Draft        Telnet Data Encryption Option            July 1999

   "IAC SB ENCRYPT END IAC SE" command.  If a START is received, and
   then a second START is received before receiving an END, the second
   START is ignored.

   If the sender of the DO would like the remote side to begin sending
   encrypted data, it can send the "IAC SB ENCRYPT REQUEST-START IAC SE"
   command.  If the sender of the DO would like the remote side to stop
   sending encrypted data, it can send the "IAC SB ENCRYPT REQUEST-STOP
   IAC SE" command.

   The current list of encryption types are listed in
   http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/telnet-options.

   If the receiver of the SUPPORT command does not support any of the
   encryption types listed in the SUPPORT command, it should send an
   "IAC SB ENCRYPT IS NULL IAC SE" to indicate that there is not a com-
   mon encryption type.  It may also send an IAC WONT ENCRYPT command to
   turn off the ENCRYPT option.

   The order of the encryption types in a SUPPORT command must be or-
   dered to indicate a preference for different encryption types, the
   first type being the most preferred, and the last type the least pre-
   ferred.

   If the ENCRYPT option has been enabled, and encrypted date is is be-
   ing received, the receipt of an "IAC WONT ENCRYPT" implies the re-
   ceipt of an "IAC SB ENCRYPT END IAC SE", e.g., the Telnet data stream
   is no longer encrypted.

   The following is an example of use of the option:
       Host1                            Host2

       [ Host1 requests Host2 negotiate to encrypt data that it sends to
         Host1, and Host2 verifies that it will negotiate the encryption
         of data that it sends to Host1.  ]
       DO ENCRYPT
                                        WILL ENCRYPT
       [ Host1 requests that Host2 enable encryption as soon as the
         initialization is completed, and informs Host2 that is supports
         DES_CFB64.  ]

       SE
       IAC SB ENCRYPT SUPPORT DES_CFB64
       IAC SE
       [ Host2 sends the initial feed to Host1, Host1 decrypts,
         modifies, and returns the feed, and Host2 re-verifies the feed.
         ]
                                        IAC SB ENCRYPT IS DES_CFB64

         REQUEST-START was received, it enables encryption.  ]

       [ All data from Host2 to Host1 is now encrypted.  ]

       [ All data from Host2 to Host1 is now in clear text again.  ]

   It is expected that any implementation that supports the Telnet EN-
   CRYPT option will support all of this specification.

6.  Security Considerations

   The ENCRYPT option used in isolation provides protection against pas-
   sive attacks, but not against active attacks.  In other words, it
   will  provide protection from someone who is just watching the IP
   packets as they pass through the network.  However, an attacker who
   is able to modify packets in flight could prevent the ENCRYPT option
   from being negotiated.

   This flaw can be remedied by using the Telnet Authentication option
   alongside the ENCRYPT option.  Specifically, setting ENCRYPT_US-
   ING_TELOPT in the authentication-type-pair can be used to force that
   Encryption be negotiated even in the face of active attacks.

   In addition, an active attacker can interfere with attempts to start
   or restart encryption.  If encryption is requested by the user, and
   the client is unable to negotiate enabling or re-enabling encryption,
   the client must assume that it is being attacked, and MUST immediate-
   ly terminate the telnet connection.
