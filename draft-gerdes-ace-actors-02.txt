Abstract

   Constrained nodes are small devices which are limited in terms of
   processing power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission
   capacity.  Due to these constraints, commonly used security protocols
   are not easily applicable.  Nevertheless, an authentication and
   authorization solution is needed to ensure the security of these
   devices.

   Due to the limitations of the constrained nodes it is especially
   important to develop a light-weight security solution which is
   adjusted to the relevant security objectives of each participating
   party in this environment.  Necessary security measures must be
   identified and applied where needed.

   In this document, the required security related tasks are identified
   as guidance for the development of authentication and authorization
   solutions for constrained environments.  Based on the tasks, an
   architecture is developed to represent the relationships between the
   logical functional entities involved.

1.  Introduction

   Constrained nodes are small devices with limited abilities which in
   many cases are made to fulfill a single simple task.  They have
   limited hardware resources such as processing power, memory, non-
   volatile storage and transmission capacity and additionally in most
   cases do not have user interfaces and displays.  Due to these
   constraints, commonly used security protocols are not always easily
   applicable.

   Constrained nodes are expected to be integrated in all aspects of
   everyday life and thus will be entrusted with vast amounts of data.
   Without appropriate security mechanisms attackers might gain control
   over things relevant to our lives.  Authentication and authorization
   mechanisms are therefore prerequisites for a secure Internet of
   Things.

   The limitations of the constrained nodes ask for security mechanisms
   which take the special characteristics of constrained environments
   into account.  Therefore, it is crucial to identify the tasks which
   must be performed to meet the security requirements in constrained
   scenarios.  Moreover, these tasks need to be assigned to logical
   functional entities which perform the tasks: the actors in the
   architecture.  Thus, relations between the actors and requirements
   for protocols can be identified.

   In this document, the required security related tasks are identified
   as guidance for the development of authentication and authorization
   solutions for constrained environments.  Based on the tasks, an
   architecture is developed to represent the relationships between the
   logical functional entities involved.

1.1.  Terminology

   Readers are required to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   defined in [RFC4949].  In addition, this document uses the following
   terminology:

   Resource (R):  an item of interest, which is represented through an
      interface.  It might contain sensor or actuator values or other
      information.

   Constrained node:  a constrained device in the sense of [RFC7228].

   Actor:  A logical functional entity that performs one or more tasks.
      Depending on the tasks an actor must perform, the device that
      contains the actor may need to have certain system resources
      available.  Multiple actors may share, i.e. be present within, a
      device or even a piece of software.

   Resource Server (RS):  An entity which hosts and represents a
      Resource.

   Client (C):  An entity which attempts to access a resource on a
      Resource Server.

   Resource Owner (RO):  The principal that owns the resource and
      controls its access permissions.

   Client Owner (CO):  The principal that owns the Client and controls
      permissions concerning authorized representations of a Resource.

   Server Authorization Manager (SAM):  An entity that prepares and
      endorses authentication and authorization data for a Resource
      Server.

   Client Authorization Manager (CAM):  An entity that prepares and
      endorses authentication and authorization data for a Client.

   Attribute Binding Authority:  An entity that is authorized to
      validate claims about an entity.

2.  Problem Statement

   The scenario this document addresses can be summarized as follows:

   o  C wants to access R on a RS.

   o  A priori, C and RS do not necessarily know each other and have no
      security relationship.

   o  C and / or RS are constrained.

              -------                            --------
              |  C  |  -- requests resource ---> |  RS  |
              -------  <-- provides resource---  --------


                         Figure 1: Basic Scenario

Internet-Draft                 ace-actors                   October 2014


   There are some security requirements for this scenario including one
   or more of:

   o  Rq0.1: No unauthorized entity has access to (or otherwise gains
      knowledge of) R.

   o  Rq0.2: No unauthorized entity can provide C with a representation
      of R (When C attempts to access R, that access reaches the proper
      R).

   Rq0.1 requires authorization on RS' side while Rq0.2 requires
   authorization on C's side.

3.  Security Objectives

   The security objectives that can be addressed by an authorization
   solution are confidentiality and integrity.  Availability cannot be
   achieved by authorization solutions.  However, misconfigured or
   wrongly designed authorization solutions can result in availability
   breaches: Users might no longer be able to use data and services as
   they are supposed to.

   Authentication mechanisms can achieve additional security objectives
   such as non-repudiation and accountability.  They are not related to
   authorization and thus are not in scope of this draft, but still
   should be considered by Authenticated Authorization solutions.  Non-
   repudiation and accountability may require authentication on device
   level, if it is necessary to determine which device performed an
   action.  In other cases it may be more important to find out who is
   responsible for the device's actions.

   The importance of a security objective depends on the application the
   authorization mechanism is used for.  [I-D.seitz-ace-usecases]
   indicates that security objectives differ for the various constrained
   environment use cases.

   In many cases, one participating party might have different security
   objectives than the other.  However, to achieve a security objective,
   both parties must participate in providing a solution.  E.g., if CO
   requires the integrity of sensor value representations RS is hosting,
   RS needs to integrity-protect the transmitted data.  Moreover, RS
   needs to protect the access to the sensor representation to prevent
   unauthorized users to manipulate the sensor values.

4.  Authentication and Authorization

   Authorization solutions aim at protecting the access to items of
   interest, e.g. hardware or software resources or data: They enable
   the owner of such a resource to control who can access it and how.

   To determine if an entity is authorized to access a resource, an
   authentication mechanism is needed.  According to the Internet
   Security Glossary [RFC4949], authentication is "the process of
   verifying a claim that a system entity or system resource has a
   certain attribute value."  Examples for attribute values are the ID
   of a device, the type of the device or the name of its owner.

   The security objectives the authorization mechanism aims at can only
   be achieved if the authentication and the authorization mechanism
   work together correctly.  We use the term _authenticated
   authorization_ to refer to a synthesis of mechanism for
   authentication and authorization.

   If used for authorization, the authenticated attributes must be
   meaningful for the purpose of the authorization, i.e. the
   authorization policy grants access permissions based on these
   attributes.  If the authorization policy assigns permissions to an
   individual entity, the authenticated attributes must be suitable to
   uniquely identify this entity.

   In scenarios where devices are communicating autonomously there is
   less need to uniquely identify an individual device.  For a resource
   owner, the fact that the device belongs to a certain company or that
   it has a specific type (e.g. light bulb) is likely more important
   than that it has a unique identifier.

   Resource and device owners need to decide about the required level of
   granularity for the authorization, ranging from _device
   authorization_ over _owner authorization_ to _binary authorization_
   and _unrestricted authorization_. In the first case different access
   permissions are granted to individual devices while in the second
   case individual owners are authorized.  If binary authorization is
   used, all authenticated entities have the same access permissions.
   Unrestricted authorization for an item of interest means that no
   authorization mechanism is used (not even by authentication) and all
   entities are able to access the item as they see fit.  More fine-
   grained authorization does not necessarily provide more security.
   Resource and device owners need to consider that an entity should
   only be granted the permissions it really needs to ensure the
   confidentiality and integrity of resources.

Internet-Draft                 ace-actors                   October 2014


   For all cases where an authorization solution is needed (all but
   Unrestricted Authorization), the authorizing party needs to be able
   to authenticate the party that is to be authorized.  Authentication
   is therefore required for messages that contain representations of an
   accessed item.  More precisely, the authorizing party needs to make
   sure that the receiver of a message containing a representation, and
   the sender of a message containing a representation are authorized to
   receive and send this message, respectively.  To achieve this, the
   integrity of these messages is required: Authenticity cannot be
   assured if it is possible for an attacker to modify the message
   during transmission.

5.  Tasks

   This section gives an overview of the tasks which must be performed
   in the given scenario (see Section 2) to meet the security
   requirements.

   As described in the problem statement, either C or RS or both of them
   are constrained.  Therefore tasks which must be conducted by either C
   or RS must be performable by constrained nodes.

5.1.  Basic Scenario Tasks

   This document does not assume a specific solution.  We assume
   however, that at least the following information is exchanged between
   the client and the server:

   o  C transmits to RS which resource it requests to access, the kind
      of action it wants to perform on the resource, and the parameters
      needed for the action.

   o  RS transmits to C the result of the attempted access.

5.2.  Security-Related Tasks

   The reason for the communication is that C wants RS to process some
   information.  RS' reaction to C's access request might be processed
   by C.  The reason for using an authorization solution is to validate
   that the entity that sent the information used for processing is
   authorized to provide it.

   To validate if a sender is authorized to send a received piece of
   information, the receiver must determine the sender's authorization.
   Correspondingly, to validate if a receiver is allowed to receive a
   message, the sender must determine its authorization.  This can only
   be achieved with the help of an authentication mechanism.

Internet-Draft                 ace-actors                   October 2014


5.3.  Authentication-Related Tasks

   Several steps must be conducted for authenticating certain attributes
   of an entity and validating the authenticity of an information:

   1.  Attribute binding: The attribute that shall be verifiable must be
       bound to a verifier, e.g. a key.  To achieve this, an entity that
       is authorized to conduct the attribute binding, the attribute
       binding authority, checks if an entity actually has the
       attributes it claims to have and then binds them to a verifier.
       The binding authority must provide some kind of endorsement
       information which enables other entities to validate this
       binding.

   Note: The attribute binding can be conducted using either symmetric
   or asymmetric cryptography.

   1.  Verifier validation: The entity that wants to authenticate the
       source of an information checks the attribute-verifier-binding
       using the endorsement provided by the attribute binding
       authority.

   2.  Authentication: The verifier is used for authenticating the
       source of a data item, i.e. it is checked whether the data item
       is bound to the verifier.  Thus the attributes of the source can
       be determined.

   Step 1 is addressed in Appendix A.2.5.  After the first step is
   conducted, step 2 and step 3 can be performed when needed.  They must
   be performed together and thus are examined together as well.  Tasks
   for step 2 and 3 are Information authenticity (see Appendix A.2.1)
   and secure communication (see Appendix A.2.3).

5.4.  Authorization-Related Tasks

   Several steps must be conducted for explicit authorization:

   1.  Configuration of authorization information: The respective owners
       (CO and RO) must configure the authorization information
       according to their authorization policy.  An authorization
       information must contain one or more permissions and the
       attribute an entity must have to apply to this authorization.

   2.  Obtaining authorization information: Authorization information
       must be made available to the entity which enforces the
       authorization.

Internet-Draft                 ace-actors                   October 2014


   3.  Authorization validation: The authorization of an entity with
       certain attributes must be confirmed by applying the request in
       conjunction with authenticated attributes to the policy provided
       by the authorization information.

   4.  Authorization enforcement: According to the result of the
       authorization validation the access to a resource is granted or
       denied.

   Tasks for step 1 are defined in Appendix A.2.6.  Appendix A.2.4
   addresses step 2.  After step 1 and step 2 are conducted, step 3 and
   step 4 can be performed when needed.  Step 3 and step 4 must be
   performed together and thus are examined together.  Appendix A.2.2
   introduces tasks for these steps.

6.  Actors

   This section describes the various actors in the architecture.  An
   actor consists of a set of tasks and additionally has an security
   domain (client domain or server domain) and a level (constrained,
   principal, less-constrained).  Tasks are assigned to actors according
   to their security domain and required level.

   Note: Actors are a concept to understand the security requirements
   for constrained devices.  The architecture of an actual solution
   might differ as long as the security requirements that derive from
   the relationship between the identified actors are considered.
   Several actors might share a single device or even be combined in a
   single piece of software.  Interfaces between actors may be realized
   as protocols or be internal to such a piece of software.

   The concept of actors is used to assign the tasks defined in
   Appendix A to logical functional entities.

6.1.  Constrained Level Actors

   As described in the problem statement (see Section 2), either C or RS
   or both of them may be located on a constrained node.  We therefore
   define that C and RS must be able to perform their tasks even if they
   are located on a constrained node.  Thus, C and RS are considered to
   be Constrained Level Actors.

   C performs the following tasks:

   o  Negotiate means for secure communication (Task TSecureComm, see
      Appendix A.2.3).

Internet-Draft                 ace-actors                   October 2014


   o  Validate that an entity is an authorized source for R (Task
      TValSourceAuthz, see Appendix A.2.2).

   o  Securely transmit an access request (Task TSendReq, see
      Appendix A.1.2).

   o  Validate that the response to an access request is authentic (Task
      TAuthnResp, see Appendix A.2.1).

   o  Process the response to an access request (Task TProcResp, see
      Appendix A.1.1).

   RS performs the following tasks:

   o  Negotiate means for secure communication (Task TSecureComm, see
      Appendix A.2.3).

   o  Validate the authenticity of an access request (Task TAuthnReq,
      see Appendix A.2.1).

   o  Validate the authorization of the requester to access the
      requested resource as requested (Task TValAccessAuthZ, see
      Appendix A.2.2).

   o  Process an access request (Task TProcReq, see Appendix A.1.1).

   o  Securely transmit a response to an access request (Task TSendResp,
      see Appendix A.1.2).

   R is an item of interest such as a sensor or actuator value.  R is
   considered to be part of RS and not a separate actor.  The device on
   which RS is located might contain several resources of different
   resource owners.  For simplicity of exposition, these resources are
   described as if they had separate RS.

   As C and RS do not necessarily know each other they might belong to
   different security domains.

           -------                            --------
           |  C  |  -- requests resource ---> |  RS  | Constrained Level
           -------  <-- provides resource---  --------

6.2.  Principal Level Actors

   Our objective is that C and RS are under control of principals in the
   physical world, the Client Owner (CO) and the Resource Owner (RO)
   respectively.  The owners decide about the security policies of their
   respective devices and belong to the same security domain.

   CO is in charge of C, i.e.  CO specifies security policies for C,
   e.g. with whom C is allowed to communicate.  By definition, C and CO
   belong to the same security domain.

   CO must fulfill the following task:

   o  Configure for C authorization information for sources for R (Task
      TConfigSourceAuthz, see Appendix A.2.6).

   RO is in charge of R and RS.  RO specifies authorization policies for
   R and decides with whom RS is allowed to communicate.  By definition,
   R, RS and RO belong to the same security domain.

   RO must fulfill the following task:

   o  Configure for RS authorization information for accessing R (Task
      TConfigAccessAuthz, see Appendix A.2.6).

      ------                            ------
      | CO |                            | RO | Principal Level
      ------                            ------
        |                                 |

6.3.  Less-Constrained Level Actors

   Constrained level actors can only fulfill a limited number of tasks
   and may not have network connectivity all the time.  To relieve them
   from having to manage keys for numerous devices and conducting
   computationally intensive tasks, another complexity level for actors
   is introduced.  An actor on the less-constrained level belongs to the
   same security domain as its respective constrained level actor.  They
   also have the same principal.

   The Client Authorization Manager (CAM) belongs to the same security
   domain as C and CO.  CAM acts on behalf of CO.  It assists C in
   authenticating RS and determining if RS is an authorized source for
   R.  CAM can do that because for C, CAM is the authority for claims
   about RS.

   CAM performs the following tasks:

   o  Validate on the client side that an entity has certain attributes
      (Task TValSourceAttr, see Appendix A.2.5).

   o  Obtain authorization information about an entity from C's owner
      and provide it to C.  (Task TObtainSourceAuthz, see
      Appendix A.2.4).

   o  Negotiate means for secure communication to communicate with C
      (Task TSecureComm, see Appendix A.2.3).

   The Server Authorization Manager (SAM) belongs to the same security
   domain as R, RS and RO.  SAM acts on behalf of RO.  It supports RS by
   authenticating C and determining C's permissions on R.  SAM can do
   that because for RS, SAM is the authority for claims about C.

   SAM performs the following tasks:

   o  Validate on the server side that an entity has certain attributes
      (Task TValReqAttr, see Appendix A.2.5).

   o  Obtain authorization information about an entity from RS' owner
      and provide it to RS (Task TObtainAccessAuthz, see
      Appendix A.2.4).

   o  Negotiate means for secure communication to communicate with RS
      (Task TSecureComm, see Appendix A.2.3).

7.  Protocol Requirements

   Devices on the less-constrained level potentially are more powerful
   than constrained level devices in terms of processing power, memory,
   non-volatile storage.  This results in different requirements for the
   protocols used on these levels.

7.1.  Constrained Level Protocols

   A protocol is considered to be on the constrained level if it is used
   between the actors C and RS which are considered to be constrained
   (see Section 6.1).  C and RS might not belong to the same security
   domain.  Therefore, constrained level protocols are required to work
   between different security domains.

   Commonly used Internet protocols can not in every case be applied to
   constrained environments.  In some cases, tweaking and profiling is
   required.  In other cases it is beneficial to define new protocols
   which were designed with the special characteristics of constrained
   environments in mind.

   On the constrained level, protocols must be used which address the
   specific requirements of constrained environments.  The Constrained

   Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] should be used as transfer
   protocol if possible.  CoAP defines a security binding to Datagram
   Transport Layer Security Protocol (DTLS) [RFC6347].  Thus, DTLS
   should be used for channel security.

   Constrained devices have only limited storage space and thus cannot
   store large numbers of keys.  This is especially important because
   constrained networks are expected to consist of thousands of nodes.
   Protocols on the constrained level should keep this limitation in
   mind.

7.1.1.  Cross Level Support Protocols

   Protocols which operate between a constrained device on one side and
   the corresponding less constrained device on the other are considered
   to be (cross level) support protocols.  Protocols used between C and
   CAM or RS and SAM are therefore support protocols.

   Support protocols must consider the limitations of their constrained
   endpoint and therefore belong to the constrained level protocols.

7.2.  Less-Constrained Level Protocols

   A protocol is considered to be on the less-constrained level if it is
   used between the actors CAM and SAM.  CAM and SAM might belong to
   different security domains.

   On the less-constrained level, HTTP [RFC7230] and Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) [RFC5246] can be used alongside or instead of CoAP and
   DTLS.  Moreover, existing security solutions for authentication and
   authorization such as the Web Authorization Protocol (OAuth)
   [RFC6749] and Kerberos [RFC4120] can likely be used without
   modifications and there are no limitations for the use of a Public
   Key Infrastructure (PKI).

Appendix A.  List of Tasks

   This section defines the tasks which must be performed in the given
   scenario (see Section 2) starting from communication related tasks
   and then deriving the required security-related tasks.  An overview
   of the tasks can be found in Section 5.



Gerdes                   Expires April 30, 2015                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                 ace-actors                   October 2014


   A task has the following structure:

   o  The name of the task which has the form TXXX

   o  One or more Requirements (if applicable) of the form RqXXX

   o  One or more Preconditions (if applicable) of the form PreXXX

   o  One or more Postconditions (if applicable) of the form PostXXX

   Requirements have to be met _while_ performing the task.  They derive
   directly from the scenario (see Section 2) or from the security
   requirements defined for the scenario.  Preconditions have to be
   fulfilled _before_ conducting the task.  Postconditions are the
   _results_ of the completed task.

   We start our analysis with the processing tasks and define which
   preconditions need to be fulfilled before these tasks can be
   conducted.  We then determine which tasks therefore need to be
   performed first (have postconditions which match the respective
   preconditions).

   Note: Regarding the communication, C and RS are defined as entities
   each having their set of attributes and a verifier which is bound to
   these attributes.  Attributes are not necessarily usable to identify
   an individual C or RS.  Several entities might have the same
   attributes.

A.1.  Basic Scenario

   The intended result of the interaction between C and RS is that C has
   successfully accessed R.  C gets to know that its access request was
   successful by receiving the answer from RS.

   The transmission of information from C to RS comprises two parts:
   sending the information on one side and receiving and processing it
   on the other.  Security has to be considered at each of these steps.

A.1.1.  Processing Information

   The purpose of the communication between C and RS is C's intent to
   access R.  To achieve this, RS must process the information about the
   requested access and C must process the information in the response
   to a requested access.  The request and the response might both
   contain resource values.

   The confidentiality and integrity of R require that only authorized
   entities are able to access R (see Rq0.1).  Therefore, C and RS must

Internet-Draft                 ace-actors                   October 2014


   check that the information is authentic and that the source of the
   information is authorized to provide it, before the information can
   be processed.  C must validate that RS is an authorized source for R.
   RS must validate that C is authorized to access R as requested.

   If proxies are used, it depends on the type of proxy how they are
   integrated into the communication and what kind of security
   relationships need to be established.  A future version of this
   document will provide more details on this topic.  At this point we
   assume that C and RS might receive the information either from RS or
   C directly or from a proxy which is authorized to speak for the
   respective communication partner.

   o  Task TProcResp: Process the response to an access request.
      Description: C processes the response to an access request
      according to the reason for requesting the resource in the first
      place.  The response might include resource values or information
      about the results of a request.
      Requirements:
      * RqProcResp.1: Is performed by C (derives from the problem
      statement).
      * RqProcResp.2: Must be performable by a constrained device
      (derives from the problem statement: C and / or RS are
      constrained).
      Preconditions:
      * PreProcResp.1: A response to an access request was sent (see
      Appendix A.1.2).
      * PreProcResp.2 (required for Rq0.2): C validated that the
      response to an access request is authentic, i.e. it stems from the
      entity requested in TSendReq (see Appendix A.1.2), i.e.  RS or an
      entity which is authorized to speak for RS (see Appendix A.2.1).
      * PreProcResp.3 (required for Rq0.2): C validated that RS or the
      entity which is authorized to speak for RS is an authorized source
      for R (see Appendix A.2.2).
      Postcondition:
      * PostProcResp.1: C processed the response.

   o  Task TProcReq: Process an access request.
      Description: RS either performs an action on the resource
      according to the information in the request, or determines the
      reason for not performing an action.
      Requirements:
      * RqProcReq.1: Is performed by RS.
      * RqProcReq.2: Must be performable by a constrained device
      (derives from the problem statement: C and / or RS are
      constrained).
      Preconditions:
      * PreProcReq.1: An access request was sent (see Appendix A.1.2).

Internet-Draft                 ace-actors                   October 2014


      * PreProcReq.2 (needed for Rq0.1): RS validated that the request
      is authentic, i.e. it stems from C or an entity which is
      authorized to speak for C and is fresh. (see Appendix A.2.1).
      * PreProcReq.3 (needed for Rq0.1): RS validated the authorization
      of C or the entity which is authorized to speak for C to access
      the resource as requested (see Appendix A.2.2).
      Postconditions:
      * PostProcReq.1: The access request was processed (fulfills
      PreSendResp.1, see Appendix A.1.2).

   Note: The preconditions PreProcReq.2 and PreProcReq.3 must be
   conducted together.  RS must assure that the response is bound to a
   verifier, the verifier is bound to certain attributes and the
   authorization information refers to these attributes.

A.1.2.  Sending Information

   The information needed for processing has to be transmitted at some
   point.  C has to transmit to RS which resource it wants to access
   with which actions and parameters.  RS has to transmit to C the
   result of the request.  The request and the response might both
   contain resource values.  To fulfill Rq0.1, the confidentiality and
   integrity of the transmitted data has to be assured.

   If proxies are used, it depends on the type of proxy how they need to
   be handled.  A future version of this document will provide more
   details on this topic.  At this point we assume that C and RS might
   transmit the message either to RS and C directly or to a proxy which
   is authorized to speak for the respective communication partner.

   o  Task TSendReq: Securely transmit an access request.
      Description: C wants to access a resource R hosted by the resource
      server RS.  To achieve this, it has to transmit some information
      to RS such as the resource to be accessed, the action to be
      performed on the resource and, if a writing access is requested,
      the value to write.  C might send the request directly to RS or to
      an entity which is authorized to speak for RS.  C assures that the
      request reaches the proper R.  C binds the request to C's verifier
      to ensure the integrity of the message.  C uses means to assure
      that no unauthorized entity is able to access the information in
      the request.
      Requirements:
      * RqSendReq.1: Is performed by C (derives from problem statement).
      * RqSendReq.2: Must be performable by a constrained device
      (derives from the problem statement: C and / or RS are
      constrained).
      * RqSendReq.3: As the request might contain resource values, the
      confidentiality and integrity of the request must be ensured

      during transmission.  Only authorized parties must be able to read
      or modify the request (derives from Rq0.1).
      Preconditions:
      * PreSendReq.1: Validate that the receiver is an authorized source
      for R (see Appendix A.2.2).
      * PreSendReq.2: To assure that the request reaches the proper RS,
      that no unauthorized party is able to access the request, and that
      the information in the request is bound to C's verifier it is
      necessary to negotiate means for secure communication with RS (see
      Appendix A.2.3).
      Postconditions:
      * PostSendReq.1: The request was sent securely to RS (necessary
      for Rq0.1) (fulfills PreProcReq.1, see Appendix A.1.1).

   Note: The preconditions PreSendReq.1 and PreSendReq.2 must be
   conducted together.  C must assure that the request reaches an entity
   with certain attributes and that the authorization information refers
   to these attributes.

   o  Task TSendResp: Securely transmit a response to an access request.
      Description: RS sends a response to an access request to inform C
      about the result of the request.  RS must assure that response
      reaches the requesting C.  RS might send the response to C or to
      an entity which is authorized to speak for C.  The response might
      contain resource values.  RS binds the request to RS's verifier to
      ensure the integrity of the message.  RS uses means to assure that
      no unauthorized entity is able to access the information in the
      response.
      Requirements:
      * RqSendResp.1: Is performed by RS (derives from the problem
      statement).
      * RqSendResp.2: Must be performable by a constrained device
      (derives from the problem statement: C and / or RS are
      constrained).
      * RqSendResp.3: As the response might contain resource values, the
      confidentiality and integrity of the response must be ensured
      during transmission.  Only authorized parties must be able to read
      or modify the response (derives from Rq0.1).
      Preconditions:
      * PreSendResp.1: An access request was processed (see
      Appendix A.1.1).
      * PreSendResp.2: If information about R is transmitted, validate
      that the receiver is authorized to access R (see Appendix A.2.2).
      * PreSendResp.3: RS must assure that the response reaches the
      requesting C, no unauthorized party is able to access the response
      and the information in the response is bound to RS' verifier:
      Means for secure communication were negotiated (see
      Appendix A.2.3).

      (fulfills PreProcResp.1, see Appendix A.1.1).

A.2.  Security-Related Tasks

A.2.1.  Information Authenticity

   This section addresses information authentication, i.e. using the
   verifier to validate the source of an information.  Information
   authentication must be conducted before processing received
   information.  C must validate that a response to an access request is
   fresh, really stems from the queried RS (or an entity which is
   authorized to speak for RS) and was not modified during transmission.
   RS must validate that the information in the access request is fresh,
   really stems from C (or an entity which is authorized to speak for C)
   and was not modified during transmission.

   The entity which processes the information must be the entity which
   is validating the source of the information.

   C and RS must assure that the authenticated source of the information
   is authorized to provide the information.

   o  Task TAuthnResp: Validate that the response to an access request
      is authentic.
      Description: C checks if the response to an access request stems
      from an entity in possession of the respective verifier and is
      fresh.  Thus, C validates that the response stems from the queried
      RS or an entity which is authorized to speak for RS.
      Requirements:
      * RqAuthnResp.1: Must be performed by C.
      * RqAuthnResp.2: Must be performable by a constrained device
      (derives from the problem statement: C and / or RS are
      constrained).
      Preconditions:
      * PreAuthnResp.1: Means for secure communication were negotiated
      (see Appendix A.2.3).
      Postconditions:
      * PostAuthnResp.1: C knows that the response came from RS
      (fulfills PreProcResp.2, see Appendix A.1.1).

   o  Task TAuthnReq: Validate the authenticity of a request.
      Description: RS checks if the request stems from an entity in
      possession of the respective verifier and is fresh.  Thus, RS
      validates that the request stems from C or an entity which is
      authorized to speak for C.
      Requirements:

      * RqAuthnReq.1: Must be performed by RS.
      * RqAuthnReq.2: Must be performable by a constrained device
      (derives from the problem statement: C and / or RS are
      constrained).
      Preconditions:
      * PreAuthnReq.1: Means for secure communication were negotiated
      (see Appendix A.2.3).
      Postconditions:
      * PostAuthnReq.1: RS knows that the request is authentic (fulfills
      PreProcReq.2, see Appendix A.1.1).

A.2.2.  Authorization Validation

   This section addresses the validation of the authorization of an
   entity.  The entity which processes the information must validate
   that the source of the information is authorized to provide it.  The
   processing entity has to verify that the source of the information
   has certain attributes which authorize it to provide the information:
   C must validate that RS (or the entity which speaks for RS) is in
   possession of attributes which are necessary for being an authorized
   source for R.  RS must validate that C (or the entity which speaks
   for C) has attributes which are necessary for a permission to access
   R as requested.

   o  Task TValSourceAuthz: Validate that an entity is an authorized
      source for R.
      Description: C checks if according to CO's authorization policy
      and the authentication endorsement provided by the attribute

      information for the access to R (see Appendix A.2.6).
      Postconditions:
      * PostObtainAccessAuthz.1: RS obtained C's authorization for
      accessing R (fulfills PreValAccessAuthz.1, see Appendix A.2.2).

A.2.5.  Attribute Binding

   As described in Section 5.3, several steps must be conducted for
   authentication.  This section addresses the binding of attributes to
   a verifier.

   For authentication it is necessary to validate if an entity has
   certain attributes.  An example for such an attribute in the physical
   world is the name of a person or her age.  In constrained
   environments, attributes might be the name of the owner or the type
   of device.  Authorizations are bound to such attributes.

   The possession of attributes must be verifiable.  For that purpose,
   attributes must be bound to a verifier.  An example for a verifier in
   the physical world is a passport.  In constrained environments, a
   verifier will likely be the knowledge of a secret.

   At some point, an authority has to check if an entity in possession
   of the verifier really possesses the claimed attributes.  In the
   physical world, government agencies check your name and age before
   they give you a passport.

   The entity that validates the claims has to provide some kind of seal
   to make its endorsement verifiable for other entities and thus bind
   the attributes to the verifier.  In the physical world passports are
   stamped by the issuing government agencies (and must only be provided
   by government agencies anyway).

   o  Task TValSourceAttr: Validate on the client side that an entity
      has certain attributes.
      Description: The claim that an entity has certain attributes has
      to be checked and made available for C in a secure way.  The
      validating party states that an entity in possession of a certain
      key has certain attributes and provides C with means to validate
      this endorsement.
      Requirements:
      * RqValSourceAttr.1: Must be performed by an entity which is
      authorized by C's owner to validate claims about RS.
      * RqValSourceAttr.3: The executing entity must have the means to
      fulfill the task (e.g. enough storage space, computational power,
      a user interface to facilitate the configuration of authentication
      policies).
      Postconditions:
      * PostValSourceAttr.1: Means for authenticating (validating the
      attribute-verifier-binding of) other entities were given to C in
      form of a verifiable endorsement (fulfills PreValSourceAuthz.2,
      see Appendix A.2.2 and PreSecureComm.1, see Appendix A.2.3).

   o  Task TValReqAttr: Validate on the server side that an entity has
      certain attributes.
      Description: The claim that an entity has certain attributes has
      to be checked and made available for RS in a secure way.  The
      validating party states that an entity in possession of a certain
      key has certain attributes and provides RS with means to validate
      this endorsement.
      Requirements:
      * RqValReqAttr.1: Must be performed by an entity which is
      authorized by RS' owner to validate claims about C.
      * RqValReqAttr.2: The executing entity must have the means to
      fulfill the task (e.g. enough storage space, computational power,
      a user interface to facilitate the configuration of authentication
      policies).
      Postconditions:
      * PostValReqAttr.1: Means for authenticating (validating the
      attribute-verifier-binding of) other entities were given to RS in
      form of a verifiable endorsement (fulfills PreValSourceAuthz.2,
      see Appendix A.2.2 and PreSecureComm.1, see Appendix A.2.3).

A.2.6.  Configuration of Authorization Information

   As stated in Section 5.4, several steps have to be conducted for
   authorization.  This section is about the configuration of
   authorization information.

   The owner of a device or resource wants to be in control of her
   device and her data.  For that purpose, she has to configure

   authorization information.  C's owner might want to configure which
   attributes an entity must have to be allowed to represent R.  R's
   owner might want to configure which attributes are required for
   accessing R with a certain action.

   o  Task TConfigSourceAuthz: Configure for C authorization information
      for sources for R.
      Description: C's owner has to define authorized sources for R.
      Requirements:
      * RqConfigSourceAuthz.1: Must be provided by C's owner.
