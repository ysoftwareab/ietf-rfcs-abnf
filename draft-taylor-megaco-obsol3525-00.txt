Abstract

   This document reclassifies RFC 3525, Gateway Control Protocol Version
   1, to Historic Status.  This memo also obsoletes RFC 3525.


1.  Reclassification of RFC 3525 to Historic

   The protocol defined by RFC 3525 [RFC3525] was developed jointly by
   the IETF Megaco Working Group and ITU-T Study Group 16.  The ITU-T

   published ITU-T Recommendation H.248.1 (initially H.248) with the
   same contents as RFC 3525.  Since that initial development, the ITU-T
   has taken ownership of the protocol and has continued to work on it.
   The protocol as originally defined in RFC 3525 underwent a series of
   corrections and clarifications.  H.248.1 version 1 [h248v1] was
   republished in March, 2002, incorporating all changes agreed up to
   that date.  Since then, further corrections have been agreed.  The
   accumulated set of corrections to H.248.1 (03/2002) is available in
   the Implementors' Guide for Recommendation H.248.1 Version 1 (03/
   2002) ("Media Gateway Control Protocol") [impgdv1], available at no
   charge on the ITU-T web site.

   RFC 3525 has been rendered even more obsolete by the publication of
   further versions of ITU-T Recommendation H.248.1.  Version 2 [h248v2]
   was published in May, 2002, and is the version most widely deployed
   at present.  It is also the version that other standards bodies such
   as 3GPP are currently using as the basis for their own profile
   specifications.  Version 3 [h248v3] was published more recently, in
   September, 2005.

   In short, RFC 3525 may serve as an introduction to the Megaco/H.248
   protocol, but is misleading as a description of the protocol as
   currently standardized or deployed.  It is appropriate to reclassify
   RFC 3525 to Historic status.


2.  Security Considerations

   Reclassifying RFC 3525 has no security implications.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any new actions by the IANA.  The IANA
   registries established by RFC 3525 and extended by successive
   versions of ITU-T H.248.1 remain in force, along with the requirement
   for expert review by an IESG-designated expert.
