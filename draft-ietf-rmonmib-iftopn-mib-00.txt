1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a method of sorting the interfaces of a
   monitored device according to values of parameters specific to this
   interface.

   This memo also includes a MIB module.  This MIB module extends the
   list of managed objects specified in [17] and [18].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [20].

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
       RFC 1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version,
       called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC
       1904 [7].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
       protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
       called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
       The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
       described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is

INTERNET DRAFT              InterfaceTopN MIB                   March 2000


       described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
       and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
       the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
       [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED","MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [16].

3. Overview

   This document continues the architecture created in the RMON MIB [17]
   and extended by the SMON MIB [18], by providing a method of ordering
   the interfaces of a device according to the value of a specific
   parameter that characterizes the interfaces.

   The need for such a technique derives from the evolution of the
   network devices - bridges / switches, routers, etc. into complex
   entities with a large number of interfaces and with many parameters
   that need to be monitored on each interface. It is common for certain
   classes of switching devices to contain hundred of ports, and for
   each port to instrument and support tens of parameters - usually
   expressed as counters - for each interface. As a result, it becomes
   impossible for applications that monitor these devices to provide a
   view that would allow the user to understand easily what is the
   status of the device, whether the behavior of a port or interface is
   in normal boundaries or not, and which are the most congested or
   problematic interfaces of the device.

   This document tries to answer this problem, by proposing a method of
   providing a sorted list of interfaces, according to programmable
   criteria. The result of applying this method will be a shorter list,



D.Romascanu               Expires September 2000                 [Page 3]





INTERNET DRAFT              InterfaceTopN MIB                   March 2000


   that includes the most significant interfaces sorted according to the
   selected criteria. One possible action that can be taken by a network
   manager could be applying to this interface a copy port operation, to
   a destination port that has a dedicated monitoring device (e.g. a
   network analyzer) connected to it. A standard MIB interface for
   performing this operation is described in [18].


4. MIB Structure

   This MIB contains one MIB group, with two tables:

    - The interfaceTopNControlTable

    - The interfaceTopNTable

   The interfaceControlTable is an RMON-style control table, allowing
   for the creation of interfaceTopN reports. The parameters specific
   for each report, like the duration of the report, the number of
   reports, start time and the characteristics of the variables that are
   sorted (absolute or 'deltas') are set in this table. An optional
   operation that is controlled from this table is the normalization of
   values of the variables, which allows for sorting of variables on the
   interfaces, despite the basic speed of the interfaces being different
   on different interfaces.

   The interfaceTopNTable provides the results in a table associated
   with the control entries.

5. Limitations and Future Work

   The objects whose values are used as criteria for sorting are
   elements in tables indexed by an InterfaceIndex type of object, as
   defined in [19] and [20]. This approach simplifies the search
   algorithm and the result table, but restricts the method to interface
   parameters. A more generic 'usrTopN' function is out of the scope of
   this document and may be the object of future investigations and
   future work.

   The values of the variables sorted in the InterfaceTopN table are
   ASN.1 Integer32 variables (Integer32, Counter, Gauge, or TimeTicks).
   This might be insufficient for higher speed interfaces. The lack of a
   'Gauge64' type of object in SMIv2, makes a straight-forward
   implementation of support for higher speed impossible.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may
   contain sensitive information. These are:
       interfaceTopNDataSourceIndex
       intefaceTopNValue

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when
   sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of
   SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed



D.Romascanu               Expires September 2000                [Page 17]





INTERNET DRAFT              InterfaceTopN MIB                   March 2000


   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in
   this MIB.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the
   use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the
   View-based Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is RECOMMENDED.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those
   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
   SET (change/create/delete) them.
