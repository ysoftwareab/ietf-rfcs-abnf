       Third Party DNS operator to Registrars/Registries Protocol
            draft-ietf-regext-dnsoperator-to-rrr-protocol-05

Abstract

   There are several problems that arise in the standard
   Registrant/Registrar/Registry model when the operator of a zone is
   neither the Registrant nor the Registrar for the delegation.
   Historically the issues have been minor, and limited to difficulty
   guiding the Registrant through the initial changes to the NS records
   for the delegation.  As this is usually a one time activity when the
   operator first takes charge of the zone it has not been treated as a
   serious issue.

   When the domain uses DNSSEC it necessary to make regular (sometimes
   annual) changes to the delegation, updating DS record(s) in order to
   track KSK rollover.  Under the current model this is prone to delays
   and errors, as the Registrant must participate in updates to DS
   records.

   This document describes a simple protocol that allows a third party
   DNS operator to: establish the initial chain of trust (bootstrap
   DNSSEC) for a delegation; update DS records for a delegation; and,
   remove DS records from a secure delegation.  The DNS operator may do
   these things in a trusted manner, without involving the Registrant
   for each operation.  This same protocol can be used by Registrants to
   maintain their own domains if they wish.

1.  Introduction

   After a domain has been registered, one of three parties will
   maintain the DNS zone loaded on the "primary" DNS servers: the
   Registrant, the Registrar, or a third party DNS operator.  DNS
   registration systems were originally designed around making
   registrations easy and fast, however after registration the
   complexity of making changes to the delegation differs for each of
   these parties.  The Registrar can make changes directly in the
   Registry systems through some API (typically EPP [RFC5730]).  The
   Registrant is typically limited to using a web interface supplied by
   the Registrar or Reseller.  Typically, a third party DNS Operator
   must to go through the Registrant to update any delegation
   information.

   Unless the responsible Registration Entity is scanning child zones
   for CDS records in order to bootstrap or update DNSSEC, the operator
   must contact and engage the Registrant in updating DS records for the
   delegation.  New information must be communicated to the Registrant,
   who must submit that information to the Registrar.  Typically this
   involves cutting and pasting between email and a web interface, which
   is error prone.  Furthermore, involving Registrants in this way does
   not scale for even moderately sized DNS operators.  Tracking
   thousands (or millions) of changes sent to customers, and following
   up if those changes are not submitted to the Registrar, or are
   submitted with errors, is itself expensive and error prone.

   The current system does not work well, as there are many types of
   failures that have been reported at all levels in the registration
   model.  The failures result in either the inability to use DNSSEC or
   in validation failures that cause the domain to become unavailable to
   users behind validating resolvers.

   The goal of this document is to create a protocol for establishing a
   secure chain of trust that involves parties not in the traditional
   Registrant/Registrar/Registry (RRR) model, and to reduce the friction
   in maintaining DNSSEC secured delegations in these cases.  It

   describes a REST-based [RFC6690] protocol which can be used to
   establish DNSSEC initial trust (to enable or bootstrap DNSSEC), and
   to trigger maintenance of DS records.

2.  Notional Conventions

2.1.  Definitions

   For the purposes of this draft, a third-party DNS Operator is any DNS
   Operator responsible for a zone, where the operator is neither the
   Registrant nor the Registrar of record for the delegation.

   Uses of "child" and "parent" refer to the relationship between DNS
   zone operators (see [RFC7719] and [I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis]).
   In this document, unless otherwise noted, the child is the third-
   party DNS operator and the parent is the Registry.

   Use of the term "Registration Entity" in this document may refer to
   any party that engages directly in registration activities with the
   Registrant.  Typically this will be a Reseller or Registrar, but in
   some cases, such as when a Registry directly sells registrations to
   the public, may apply to the Registry.  Even in cases where a
   Registrar is involved, this term may still apply to a Registry if
   that Registry normally accepts DS/DNSKEY updates directly from
   Registrants.

   The CDS and CDNSKEY DNS resource records, having substantially the
   same function but for different record types, are used interchangably
   in this document.  Unless otherwise noted, any use of "CDS" or
   "CDNSKEY" can be assumed to also refer to the other.

2.2.  RFC2119 Keywords

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Process Overview

3.1.  Identifying the Registration Entity

   As of publication of this document, there has never been a
   standardized or widely deployed method for easily and scalably
   identifying the Registration Entity for a particular registration.

   At this time, WHOIS [RFC3912] is the only widely deployed protocol to
   carry such information, but WHOIS responses are unstructured text,
   and each implementor can lay out its text responses differently.  In



Latour, et al.          Expires November 5, 2018                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                  3-DNS-RRR                       May 2018


   addition, Registries may include referrals in this unstructured text
   to the WHOIS interfaces of their Registrars, and those Registrar
   WHOIS interface in turn have their own layouts.  This presents a text
   parsing problem which is infeasible to solve.

   RDAP, the successor to WHOIS, described in [RFC7480], solves the
   problems of unstructured responses, and a consistently implemented
   referral system, however at this time RDAP has yet to be deployed at
   most Registries.

   With no current mechanism in place to scalably discover the Registrar
   for a particular registration, the problem of automatic discovery of
   the base URL of the API is considered out of scope of this document.
   The authors recommend standardization of an RDAP extension to obtain
   this information from the Registry.

3.2.  Establishing a Chain of Trust

   After signing the zone, the child DNS Operator needs to upload the DS
   record(s) to the parent.  The child can signal its desire to have
   DNSSEC validation enabled by publishing one of the special DNS
   records CDS and/or CDNSKEY as defined in [RFC7344] and [RFC8078].

   Registration Entities MAY regularly scan the child name servers of
   unsecured delegations for CDS records in order to bootstrap DNSSEC,
   and are advised to do so.  At the time of publication, some ccTLD
   Registries are already doing this.  A Registration Entity that
   regularly scans all child zones under its responsibility (both
   secured and unsecured) for CDS will not require the API described in
   this document.  However, such a Registration Entity should follow the
   guidelines discussed in Section 3.5 below when using CDS to bootstrap
   DNSSEC on a previously unsecured delegation.

   In the case where the Registration Entity is not normally scanning
   child zones for CDS records, the Registration Entity SHOULD implement
   the API from this document, allowing child operators to notify the
   Registration Entity to begin such a scan.

   Once the Registration Entity finds CDS records in a child zone it is
   responsible for, or receives a signal via this API, it SHOULD start
   acceptance processing as described below.

3.3.  Maintaining the Chain of Trust

   Once the secure chain of trust is established, the Registration
   Entity SHOULD regularly scan the child zone for CDS record changes.
   If the Registration Entity implements the protocol described in this




Latour, et al.          Expires November 5, 2018                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                  3-DNS-RRR                       May 2018


   document, then it SHOULD also accept signals via this protocol to
   immediately check the child zone for CDS records.

   Server implementations of this protocol MAY include rate limiting to
   protect their systems and the systems of child operators from abuse.

   Each parent operator and Registration Entity is responsible for
   developing, implementing, and communicating their DNSSEC maintenance
   policies.

3.4.  Acceptance Processing

   The Registration Entity, upon receiving a signal or detecting through
   polling that the child desires to have its delegation updated, SHOULD
   run a series of tests to ensure that updating the parent zone will
   not create or exacerbate any problems with the child zone.  The basic
   tests SHOULD include:

   o  checks that the child zone is is properly signed as per the
      Registration Entity and parent DNSSEC policies

   o  if updating the DS record, a check to ensure the child CDS RRset
      references a KSK which is present in the child DNSKEY RRset and
      signs the CDS RRset

   o  ensuring all name servers in the apex NS RRset of the child zone
      agree on the apex NS RRset and CDS RRset contents

   The Registration Entity SHOULD NOT make any changes to the DS RRset
   if the child name servers do not agree on the CDS content.

3.5.  Bootstrapping DNSSEC

   Registration Entities SHOULD require compliance with additional tests
   in the case of establishing a new chain of trust.

   o  The Registration Entity SHOULD check that all child name servers
      respond with a consistent CDS RRset for a number of queries over
      an extended period of time.  Any change in DS response or
      inconsistency between child responses in that time might indicate
      an attempted Man in the Middle (MITM) attack, and SHOULD reset the
      test.  This minimizes the possibility of an attacker spoofing
      responses.  An example of such a policy might be to scan all child
      name servers in the delegation NS RRset every two hours for a
      week.

Internet-Draft                  3-DNS-RRR                       May 2018


   o  The Registration Entity SHOULD require all of the child name
      servers in the delegation NS RRset to send the same response to a
      CDS query whether sent over TCP or UDP.

   o  The Registration Entity MAY require the child zone to implement
      zone delegation best practices as described in
      [I-D.wallstrom-dnsop-dns-delegation-requirements].

   o  The Registration Entity MAY require the child operator to prove
      they can add data to the zone, for example by publishing a
      particular token.  See Section 4.2.2 below.

4.  API Definition

   This protocol is partially synchronous, meaning the server can elect
   to hold connections open until operations have completed, or it can
   return a status code indicating that it has received a request, and
   close the connection.  It is up to the child to monitor the parent
   for completion of the operation, and issue possible follow-up calls
   to the Registration Entity.

   Clients may be denied access to change the DS records for domains
   that are Registry Locked (HTTP Status code 401).  Registry Lock is a
   mechanism provided by certain Registries or Registrars that prevents
   domain hijacking by ensuring no attributes of the domain are
   changeable, and no transfer or deletion transactions can be processed
   against the domain name without manual intervention.

4.1.  Authentication

   The API does not impose any unique server authentication
   requirements.  The server authentication provided by TLS fully
   addresses the needs of this protocol.  The API MUST be provided over
   TLS-protected transport (e.g., HTTPS) or VPN.

   Client authentication is considered out of scope of this document.
   The publication of CDS records in the child zone is an indication
   that the child operator intends to perform DS-record-updating
   activities (add/delete) in the parent zone.  Since this protocol is
   simply a signal to the Registration Entity that they should examine
   the child zone for such intentions, additional authentication of the
   client making the request is considered unnecessary.

   Registration Entities MAY implement their own policy to protect
   access to the API, such as with IP white listing, client TLS
   certificates, etc..  Registration Entities SHOULD take steps to
   ensure that a lack of additional authentication does not open up a

   denial of service mechanism against the systems of the Registration
   Entity, the Registry, or the child operator.

4.2.  RESTful Resources

   In the following text, "{domain}" is the child zone to be operated
   on.

4.2.1.  CDS resource

   Path: /domains/{domain}/cds

4.2.1.1.  Establishing Initial Trust (Enabling DNSSEC)

4.2.1.1.1.  Request

   Syntax: POST /domains/{domain}/cds

   Request that an initial set of DS records based on the CDS record in
   the child zone be inserted into the Registry and the parent zone upon
   the successful completion of the request.  If there are multiple CDS
   records in the CDS RRset, multiple DS records will be added.

   The body of the POST SHOULD be empty, however server implementations
   SHOULD NOT reject nonempty requests.

4.2.1.1.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 201 indicates a success.

   o  HTTP Status code 400 indicates a failure due to validation.

   o  HTTP Status code 401 indicates an unauthorized resource access.

   o  HTTP Status code 403 indicates a failure due to an invalid
      challenge token.

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 409 indicates the delegation already has a DS
      RRset.

   o  HTTP Status code 429 indicates the client has been rate-limited.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

   This request is for setting up initial trust in the delegation.  The
   Registration Entity SHOULD return a status code 409 if it already has
   a DS RRset for the child zone.

   Upon receipt of a 403 response the child operator SHOULD issue a POST
   for the "token" resource to fetch a challenge token to insert into
   the zone.

4.2.1.2.  Removing DS Records

4.2.1.2.1.  Request

   Syntax: DELETE /domains/{domain}/cds

   Request that the Registration Entity check for a null CDS or CDNSKEY
   record in the child zone, indicating a request that the entire DS
   RRset be removed.  This will make the delegation insecure.

4.2.1.2.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 200 indicates a success.

   o  HTTP Status code 400 indicates a failure due to validation.

   o  HTTP Status code 401 indicates an unauthorized resource access.

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 412 indicates the parent does not have a DS RRset

   o  HTTP Status code 429 indicates the client has been rate-limited.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.2.1.3.  Modifying DS Records

4.2.1.3.1.  Request

   Syntax: PUT /domains/{domain}/cds

   Request that the Registration Entity modify the DS RRset based on the
   CDS/CDNSKEY available in the child zone.  As a result of this request
   the Registration Entity SHOULD add or delete DS or DNSKEY records as
   indicated by the CDS/CDNSKEY RRset, but MUST NOT delete the entire DS
   RRset.

4.2.1.3.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 200 indicates a success.

   o  HTTP Status code 400 indicates a failure due to validation.

   o  HTTP Status code 401 indicates an unauthorized resource access.

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 412 indicates the parent does not have a DS RRset

   o  HTTP Status code 429 indicates the client has been rate-limited.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.2.2.  Token resource

   Path: /domains/{domain}/token

4.2.2.1.  Establish Initial Trust with Challenge

4.2.2.1.1.  Request

   Syntax: GET /domains/{domain}/token

   The DNSSEC policy of the Registration Entity may require proof that
   the DNS Operator is in control of the domain.  The token API call
   returns a random token to be included as a TXT record for the
   _delegate.@ domain name (where @ is the apex of the child zone) prior
   establishing the DNSSEC initial trust.  This is an additional trust
   control mechanism to establish the initial chain of trust.

   Once the child operator has received a token, it SHOULD be inserted
   in the zone and the operator SHOULD proceed with a POST of the cds
   resource.

   The Registration Entity MAY expire the token after a reasonable
   period.  The Registration Entity SHOULD document an explanation of
   whether and when tokens are expired in their DNSSEC policy.

   Note that the _delegate TXT record is publicly available and not a
   secret token.

4.2.2.1.2.  Response

   o  HTTP Status code 200 indicates a success.  A token is included in
      the body of the response, as a valid TXT record

   o  HTTP Status code 404 indicates the domain does not exist.

   o  HTTP Status code 500 indicates a failure due to unforeseeable
      reasons.

4.3.  Customized Error Messages

   Registration Entities MAY provide a customized error message in the
   response body in addition to the HTTP status code defined in the
   previous section.  This response MAY include an identifying number/
   string that can be used to track the request.

5.  Security considerations

   When zones are properly provisioned, and delegations follow standards
   and best practices (e.g.
   [I-D.wallstrom-dnsop-dns-delegation-requirements]), the Registration
   Entity or Registry can trust the DNS information it receives from
   multiple child name servers, over time, and/or over TCP to establish
   the initial chain of trust.

   In addition, the Registration Entity or Registry can require the DNS
   Operator to prove they control the zone by requiring the child
   operator to navigate additional hurdles, such as adding a challenge
   token to the zone.

   This protocol should increase the adoption of DNSSEC, enabling more
   zones to become validated thus overall the security gain outweighs
   the possible drawbacks.

   Registrants and DNS Operators always have the option to establish the
   chain of trust in band via the standard Registrant/Registrar/Registry
   model.

6.  IANA Actions

   This document has no actions for IANA

7.  Internationalization Considerations

   This protocol is designed for machine to machine communications.
   Clients and servers SHOULD use punycode [RFC3492] when operating on
   internationalized domain names.
