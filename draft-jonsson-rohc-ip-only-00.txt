Abstract

   The original RObust Header Compression (ROHC) RFC, RFC 3095, defines
   a framework for header compression, along with compression protocols
   (profiles) for IP/UDP/RTP, IP/ESP, IP/UDP, and also for uncompressed
   packet streams. However, no profile was defined for compression of IP
   only, which has been identified as a flaw in RFC 3095. This document
   addresses that problem and defines a ROHC compression profile for IP,
   similar to the IP/UDP profile defined by RFC 3095, but simplified to
   exclude UDP.

1.  Introduction

   The original RObust Header Compression (ROHC) RFC [RFC-3095] defines
   a framework for header compression, along with compression protocols
   (profiles) for IP/UDP/RTP, IP/ESP, IP/UDP, and also for uncompressed
   packet streams. The profile for uncompressed data was defined to
   provide means to encapsulate all traffic over a link within ROHC
   packets. Through this profile, the lower layers do not have to
   provide multiplexing for different packet types, but instead ROHC can
   handle any packet stream, even if compression profiles for all kinds
   of packet streams have yet not been defined or implemented over the
   link.

   Although the profile without compression is simple and can tunnel
   arbitrary packets, it has of course a major weakness in that it does
   not compress the headers at all. When considering that normally all
   packets are expected to be IP [RFC-791, RFC-1883] packets, and that
   the IP header often represent a major part of the total header, a
   useful alternative to no compression would for most packets be
   compression of the IP header only. Unfortunately, such a profile was
   not defined in [RFC-3095], and this has thus been identified as an
   important missing piece in the ROHC toolbox.

   This document addresses this missing compression support and defines
   a ROHC compression profile for IP [RFC-791, RFC-1883] only, similar
   to the IP/UDP profile defined by [RFC-3095], but simplified to
   exclude UDP. Due to the similarities with the IP/UDP profile, the IP
   compression profile is described based on the IP/UDP profile, mainly
   covering differences.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC-2119].

   ROHC UDP

       "ROHC UDP" in this document refers to the IP/UDP profile
       (Profile 0x0002) as defined in [RFC-3095].

3.  ROHC IP Compression (Profile 0x0004)

   In principle, there is no real difference between the ROHC UDP
   profile and the IP profile defined in this document, since the
   removal of UDP does not at all effect the compression mechanisms. As
   for ROHC UDP, the compressor generates 16-bit sequence number which
   increases by one for each packet compressed in the packet stream,
   called SN or IP SN below. Unless stated explicitly below, mechanisms
   and formats are as for ROHC UDP.

3.1.  Initialization

   The static context for ROHC IP compression can be initialized in
   either of two ways:

   1) By using an IR packet as in ROHC UDP, where the profile is
      0x0004 and the static chain ends with the static part of an
      IP header. At the compressor, IP SN is initialized to a random
      value when the IR packet is sent.

   2) By reusing an existing context where the existing static chain
      contains the static part of an IP header. As for ROHC UDP, this
      is done with an IR-DYN packet, but now identifying profile 0x0004,
      where the dynamic chain corresponds to the prefix of the existing
      static chain that ends with the IP header. At the compressor,
      IP SN is initialized to a random value.

   For ROHC IP, the dynamic part of a compressed packet is similar to
   the one for ROHC UDP, with a two-octet filed containing the SN added
   to the end of the chain. This affects the format of dynamic chains in
   IR and IR-DYN packets.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC-3095] apply equally to this
   document, without exceptions or additions.

5.  IANA Considerations

   ROHC profile identifier 0x0004 has been reserved by the IANA for the
   profile defined in this document.

   [TO BE REMOVED BEFORE PUBLICATION]
      A ROHC profile identifier must be reserved by the IANA for the
      profile defined in this document. Profile number 0x0004 has
      previously been saved for this purpose, and should thus be used.
      As for previous ROHC profiles, profile numbers 0xnnXX must also be
      reserved for future updates of this profile. A suggested
      registration in the "RObust Header Compression (ROHC) Profile
      Identifiers" name space would then be:
