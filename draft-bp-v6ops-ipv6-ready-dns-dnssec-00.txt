                draft-bp-v6ops-ipv6-ready-dns-dnssec-00

Abstract

   This document defines the timing for implementing a worldwide
   IPv6-Ready DNS and DNSSEC infrastructure, in order to facilitate the
   global IPv6-only deployment.

   A key issue for this, is the need for a global support of DNSSEC and
   DNS64, which in some scenarios do not work well together.  This
   document states that any DNSSEC signed resources records should
   include a native IPv6 resource record as the most complete and
   expedient path to solve any deployment conflict with DNS64 and DNSSEC

1.  Introduction

   One of the main issues to ensure the best path for the IPv4 to IPv6
   transition and the support of an IPv6-only Internet, is to ensure
   that all the services remain accessible by means of DNS.

   One of the alternatives is the use of NAT64 ([RFC6146]) and DNS64
   ([RFC6147]), sometimes by means 464XLAT ([RFC6877]), which will help
   to ensure that, when a network or part of it, becomes IPv6-only,
   still can have access to IPv4-only resources.

   DNS64 ([RFC6147]) is a widely deployed technology allowing hundreds
   of millions of IPv6-only hosts/networks to reach IPv4-only resources.
   DNSSEC is a technology used to validate the authenticity of
   information in the DNS, however, as DNS64 ([RFC6147]) modifies DNS
   answers and DNSSEC is designed to detect such modifications, DNS64
   ([RFC6147]) can break DNSSEC in some circumstances.

   Furthermore, the deployment of those transition mechanisms means that
   the cost of the transition is on the back of the service provider,
   because the investment required in the devices that take care of that
   transition services and the support of the helpdesks to resolve
   issues.  So in the end, all that cost is indirectly charged to the
   end-user, which is unfair.

   It seems obvious that should not be that way, and the end-goal is a
   situation where we get rid-off IPv4-only services, and meanwhile, the

   cost borne by the IPv4 laggards operating those services.

   This document provides the steps to be able to tackle that situation
   and advance with the global IPv6 deployment in a fair way.

   The document also states that the most complete and expedient path to
   avoid any negative interactions is, for the DNSSEC signed resources,
   to always include IPv6 AAAA resources records.  As stated in
   [RFC6540], IPv6 [RFC8200] is not optional and failing to support IPv6
   may result in failure to communicate on the Internet, especially when
   DNSSEC signed IPv4-only resources are present.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The Conflict Between DNS64 and DNSSEC

   DNS64 ([RFC6147]) is a key part of widely deployed IPv6-only
   transition mechanism such as 464XLAT ([RFC6877]) and Happy Eyeballs
   version 2 ([RFC8305]).  Currently, hundreds of millions of hosts rely
   on DNS64 ([RFC6147]) for access to the Internet.  A core function of
   DNS64 ([RFC6147]) is generating an inauthentic AAAA DNS record when
   an authentic AAAA DNS record for a host is not available from the
   authoritative nameserver.  DNSSEC's fundamental feature is detecting
   and denying inauthentic DNS resource records.  While DNS64
   ([RFC6147]) outlines may work in harmony with DNSSEC, the
   preconditions may not always exist for harmony to be achieved.

4.  Resolving the DNS64 and DNSSEC Conflict by Requiring AAAA

   DNS64 ([RFC6147]) and DNSSEC are both important components of the
   current and future Internet.  The limitation for how these protocols
   interact is unlikely to changes.  Deploying DNSSEC and IPv6 are both
   commonly achievable for a typical Internet system operator using
   their own systems or using a third-party service.  The resolution to
   the DNS64 ([RFC6147]) and DNSSEC conflict is to simply deploy both,
   IPv6 and DNSSEC in tandem.

   Deploying DNSSEC signed IPv4 resources records without matching IPv6
   records is a risk and not recommend.

   Ultimately, this guidance is simply restating [RFC6540], that IPv6 is
   mandatory for all Internet systems.

5.  Ensuring a smooth IPv4-IPv6 transition by Requiring AAAA

   Similarly, to what is stated in the precedent section for DNS64
   ([RFC6147]) and DNSSEC, a smoother and less painful transition from
   IPv4 to IPv6, and the succesful deployment of an IPv6-only Internet,
   can be facilitated by requiring AAAA resource records at every DNS
   instance.

6.  Definition of IPv6-Ready DNS/DNSSEC Infrastructure

   In the context of this document, and others that may be generated as
   a consequence of it, "IPv6-Ready DNS/DNSSEC Infrastructure" means
   that a DNS/DNSSEC server (root, TLD, authoritative NS, others) is
   fully accessible and operational if queried either from a remote
   dual-stack network or an IPv6-only network.

   In general, that means having AAAA RRs in addition to A RRs, ensuring
   that PMTUD works correctly and fragmentation is correctly handled.

   In case DNSSEC is implemented with IPv4, it MUST support also
   IPv6-only operation according the above considerations.

7.  Implementation timing

   Towards the implementation of the worldwide IPv6-Ready DNS/DNSSEC
   infrastructure, considering that there are no excuses for a DNS
   operator to support IPv6, the following deadlines are defined
   counting since the date this document becomes an RFC:

   1.  All the root and TLDs MUST be IPv6-Ready in 6 months.

   2.  All the DNSSEC signed zones MUST be IPv6-Ready in 6 months.

   3.  All the authoritative NS MUST be IPv6-Ready in 12 months.

   4.  The remaining RRs in other DNS servers, MUST be IPv6-Ready in 18
       months.

   Probing mechanisms to verify that the relevant AAAA are fully
   operational MUST be setup by IANA.  If there is a failure at the
   deadline in complying with those requirements, the relevant NS, MUST
   be temporarily suspended until there is a subsequent successful
   verification.

8.  Security Considerations

   DNSSEC is a good security practice.  Providing AAAA DNSSEC signed
   records wherever a DNSSEC signed A record is used ensures the most
   effective use of DNSSEC.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA and ICANN are instructed by means of this document, to take the
   relevant measures for ensuring the steps towards the above indicated
   implementation timing.

   It is suggested that frequent warnings are provided to the relevant
   stakeholders, in advance to each of the deadlines.
