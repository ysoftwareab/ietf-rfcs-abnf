Abstract

   Today IPv6  nodes are generally  dual stacked.  With  its automatic
   configuration  of  tunnel  end   points,  [DSTM]  is  an  appealing
   transition mechanism, provided that an efficient dynamic allocation
   of IPv4 address process is  available.

   As stated in [DSTM] :
   "In DSTM, a mechanism is needed to perform the address allocation
   process. This can be decoupled in two functions: the management of
   the IPv4 address pool and the communication protocol between server
   and clients. A number of mechanisms, like DHCPv6, can perform these
   functions. The choice of the method to be used is out of scope and
   will be described in other documents."

   The aim of this document is to propose such a mechanism where a
   router, using extensions to neighbour discovery [ND], can manage
   this allocation process. It is worth to mention that the idea to
   entrust to a router the management of a pool of addresses is
   already widely used in NAT.

1. Introduction

   Today  IPv6 nodes are  generally dual  stacked. With  its automatic
   configuration of  tunnel end points, [DSTM] is  an appealing
   transition mechanism provided  that an efficient dynamic allocation
   of IPv4 address is available.  The  aim of this document is to show
   how a  TEP using  extensions to neighbour  discovery can
   manage this allocation process.

   This document proposes 2 adaptations for ICMPv6 RA/RS messages.

   1.1 Scope of the document

   This document does not aim at redefining DSTM itself. It only aims
   at defining a process based on ICMPv6 messages to manage the
   temporary allocation of IPv4 address to a DSTM Node. In particular,
   it does not describe the communication between the V4 host and the
   DSTM Node after the 4over6 interface has been configured.

   1.2 IPv6 DSTM Terminology [Borrowed from [DSTM]]

   DSTM Domain    The network areas on an Intranet where IPv6 nodes
                  use DSTM to assure IPv4 communication. An IPv4
                  address allocation server may be deployed inside the
                  domain to manage an IPv4 address pool. IPv4 routing
                  access may not be maintained within a DSTM domain.

   DSTM Server    A process in charge of managing the IPv4 address
                  space that will be allocated to DSTM Nodes.

   Tunnel End Point (TEP) Destination of IPv6 flows containing IPv4
                  packets.  It assures the forwarding function
                  between the DSTM domain and a given IPv4 network.

   4over6 Tunnelling Encapsulation of IPv4 packets over IPv6. Used for
                  carrying IPv4 flows from one node to another in a
                  DSTM Domain.

      DSTM Client A process on a DSTM Node who manages the temporary
		  IPv4 address allocated by the DSTM Server.

      DSTM Node   A node that implements both IPv4 and IPv6 stacks,
		  4over6 tunnelling and is a DSTM client. A DSTM node
		  generates only IPv6 packets on the network.

2. Using neighbour discovery for DSTM

   DSTM  defines that if  IPv4 routing  is not  supported in  the DSTM
   domain, IPv4 is  tunnelled over IPv6 from the DSTM  Host to the TEP
   which de-encapsulates and then  forwards packets over IPv4 external
   network.  A  DSTM server is  responsible for managing the  TEPs and
   maintaining a pool of IPv4 addresses.

   There is  a need for  a dialog between  the DSTM Node and  the DSTM
   server, similarly to the dialog in the neighbour discovery process.

   This section shows this  dialog when the communication is initiated
   by a DSTM Node or by a IPv4 only node.

   In the examples below, the following notation, borrowed from [DSTM]
   will be used:

     X   will designate an IPv6 DSTM Node, X6 will be the IPv6 address
          of this host and X4 the IPv4 address
     Y    will designate a DSTM server.
     Z    will designate an IPv4-only host and Z4 its address.
    ==>   means an IPv6 packet
    -->   means an IPv4 packet
    +=>   means  a  tunneled  IPv6  packet is  encapsulated in an IPv6
          packet
    ..>   means a DNS  query or   response. The  path  taken  by  this
          packet   does not matter in  the examples "a"  means the DNS
          name of a host

2.1 Communication initiated by a DSTM Node
                   DNS
DSTM Node  DSTM server V4 host
    X6       Y6/Y4      Z4
    |          |          |
    |. . . . . . . .>  Z  | - DSTM Node asks the DNS for an AAAA for Z
    |<. . . . . . . error | - the DNS answers with an error
    |. . . . . . . .>  Z  | - DSTM Node asks for the A RR for Z
    |<. . . . . . . . Z4  | - the answer is Z4
    |          |          | - The  application  sends  its  first  IPv4
    |          |          |   packet which arrives to the 4over6
    |          |          |   interface not yet configured. DSTM Node
    |          |          |   needs an IPv4 address (first use).
    |+=+=+=+=+>|          | - DSTM Node queries the DSTM server for an
    |          |          |   IPv4 address using an encapsulated RS
    |          |          |   request.
    |<+=+=+=+=+|          | - The  DSTM server provides  a temporary
    |          |          |   IPv4 address and the TEP address with an
    |          |          |   encapsulated RA answer to DSTM Node.
    |    <=====|          | - The DSTM server sends dynamic  update to
    |          |          |   DNS with the temporary IPv4 address of
    |          |          |   the DSTM Node for further IPv4 initiated
    |          |          |   communications
    |          |          | - The 4over6 now fully configured interface
    |          |          |   can send the IPv4 encapsulated in IPv6 packet
    |          |          |   to the TEP.

   As specified in [ND] RA/RS packets have a local link scope. To
   overpass this packets exchanged between the DSTM server and the
   DSTM Node are encapsulated in IPv6 packets.

2.2 Communication initiated by a IPv4 only node

        DNS
DSTM Node  DSTM server V4 host
    X6       Y6/Y4      Z4
    |          |          |
    |    < . . . . . . .  | - Z4 asks the DNS for an A RR for "X"
    |    +=+=+>|          | - the DNS only finds a  IPv6  address. It
    |          |          |   generates itself the RS request that DSTM
    |          |          |   host makes in the case of communication
    |          |          |   described in 2.1.
    |<+=+=+=+=+|          | - DSTM server  allocates a  temporary IPv4
    |          |          |   address, choose a TEP and sends both with
    |          |          |   an encapsulated RA to the DSTM Node.
    |    <+=+=+|          | - DSTM server sends a  dynamic  update  to
    |          |          |   DNS with X6 IPv4 temporary address.
    |   . . . . . . . . > | - DNS answers the A RR to Z4
    |          |<---------| - Z4 can now send its packets to DSTM Node
    |          |          |   through the TEP.

    Because DNS just generates itself to DSTM server a request for a
    temporary IPv4 address as issued by DSTM Node, the case of
    communication initiated by a IPv4 only nodes is managed in exactly
    the same way it is when initiated by a DSTM Node.

2.3 Tunneling of ND messages

   As specified in [ND] RA/RS ICMP packets have a local link scope. To
   overpass this, packets exchanged between DSTM server and the DSTM
   host are encapsulated in IPv6 packets.

DSTM Node   DSTM server
    |          |
    |+=+=+=+=+>| - RS packet encapsulated in IPv6 packet,
    |          |   IPv6 packet fields:
    |          |   Sender address: The IPv6 address of the interface
    |          |      of DSTM Node that can be routed to DSTM server.
    |          |   Destination address: The IPv6 address of DSTM
    |          |       server that can be routed from DSTM Node
    |          |   Payload:  The RS packet. (See chapter 3.1 for its
    |          |      detailed format).
    |<+=+=+=+=+| - RA packet encapsulated in IPv6 packet,
    |          |   IPv6 packet fields:
    |          |   Sender address: The IPv6 address of DSTM server
    |          |        that can be routed to DSTM Node.
    |          |   Destination address: The IPv6 address of the
    |          |        DSTM Node that can be routed from DSTM server.
    |          |   Payload: The RA packet. (See  chapter  3.2  for its
    |          |        detailed format).

    The tunnel between DSTM server and DSTM Node (and reciprocally
    between DSTM Node and DSTM server) is "degenerated" (tunnel
    entrance and exit coincide with the endpoints of the traffic
    beeing tunneled). So it does not have any security problem. 

    There is no need for any manual configuration of the TEP
    addresses. They are known from the encapsulated packet. The
    tunneling can be automatic for the host and the DSTM server .

2.4 DSTM requirements related to tunneling for DSTM Nodes and servers

    Current implementations of IPv6, in hosts and routers, do not
    manage the automatic tunneling. A DSTM capable interface MUST
    implement the following characteristics:
    
    Case of the host: 
	 MUST encapsulate DSTM RS packets (see 3.1) sent to the DSTM
	 server.
	 MUST decapsulate any 6over6 packet and accept DSTM RA packets
	 (see 3.2) sent to it by the DSTM server.
    
    Case of the DSTM server: 
	 MUST encapsulate DSTM RA packets (see 3.2) sent to a DSTM
	 host.
	 MUST decapsulate any 6over6 packet and accept DSTM RS packets
	 (see 3.1) sent to it by a DSTM Node.

    The way encapsulation and decapsulation are performed, is
    implementation dependent. It is also implementation dependent to
    decide if an interface is always "DSTM capable" or if it must be
    declared "DSTM capable" by an administrator.

3. Format of new ND messages
  3.1 RS for IPv4 address solicitation [ borrowed from RFC 2461]

The present draft specifies a new option called "DSTM mapping request".

   the ICMP header of the RA messages indicating that the router acts
   as a DSTM server. The router MUST send this RA only on response to
   a Router Solicitation with option "DSTM mapping request".

                     this Router advertisement  is also functioning as
                     a Mobile  IP home agent  on this link.  Else this
                     bit MUST be set to 0

      D              The  bit D is set to 1 to indicate  in  a  Router
                     Advertisement that the router sending this router

		     Server.
                     Else this bit MUST be set to 0.

      Res            A 4-bit unused field.   It MUST be initialized to
                     zero  by the sender  and MUST  be ignored  by the
                     receiver.

      Router Lifetime
                     16-bit unsigned integer.  The lifetime associated
                     with the default router in units of seconds.  The
                     maximum  value  corresponds  to  18.2  hours.   A
                     Lifetime of 0 indicates  that the router is not a
                     default  router  and  SHOULD  NOT appear  on  the
                     default router list.  The Router Lifetime applies
                     only  to  the router's  usefulness  as a  default
                     router;   it  does   not  apply   to  information
                     contained  in other  message  fields or  options.
                     Options   that  need   time   limits  for   their
                     information include their own lifetime fields.

      Reachable Time
                     32-bit   unsigned    integer.    The   time,   in
                     milliseconds, that  a node assumes  a neighbor is
                     reachable  after having  received  a reachability
                     confirmation.      Used    by     the    Neighbor
                     Unreachability  Detection algorithm.  A  value of
                     zero means unspecified (by this router).

      Retrans Timer
                     32-bit   unsigned    integer.    The   time,   in
                     milliseconds,   between   retransmitted  Neighbor
                     Solicitation    messages.    Used    by   address
                     resolution   and   the  Neighbor   Unreachability
                     Detection  algorithm   A  value  of   zero  means
                     unspecified (by this router).

   As possible in [ND], this draft proposes a new option called "DSTM".

   Format of the "DSTM" option :

   This document proposes to specify a new option field to hold the
   IPv4 temporary address associated to the requesting DSTM Node and
   the IPv6 address of the TEP that can be different from the DSTM
   server.

   The format of the DSTM option is as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     Type            (TBD)
     Length          8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option
                     (including the type and length fields) in units of
                     8 octets. The value of 4 is mandatory.  Nodes MUST
                     silently discard an ND packet that contains a DSTM
                     option with length different from 4.

     Valid Lifetime  32-bit unsigned  integer.  The length  of time in
                     seconds (relative to the time the packet is sent)
                     that the  IPv4 and  IPv6 addresses are  valid for
                     the purpose of the  DSTM association.  A value of
                     all one bits (0xffffffff) represents infinity.

     Preferred Lifetime
                     32-bit unsigned  integer.  The length  of time in
                     seconds (relative to the time the packet is sent)
                     that the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are prefered for
                     the purpose of the  DSTM association.  A value of
                     all one bits (0xffffffff) represents infinity.

     IPv4 address:   The temporarily IPv4 address allocated to the
                     DSTM Node by the DSTM server.

     IPv6 address:   The address of  the TEP that will be  used by the
                     DSTM Node. This address MAY be the same as the 
		     DSTM server address if DSTM server acts also as a 
		     TEP.

   Since RA packets sent by DSTM server to DSTM Node are encapsulated
   into IPv6 packets, the standard MTU rules apply.

3.3 Request of Dual Stack Node to renew the lease

  As specified in [DSTM], before expiration of an initial lease, the
  node just send a "normal" RS to IPv6/V4 router. It's the
  responsibility of the router to issue a new lease with a "normal" RA
  with a new duration. The router MAY use an exponential allocation
  duration to limit the RS/RA traffic.

4. Security issues

   By  the  virtue  of   authentication  headers  in  RA/RS  messages,
   communication in the IPv6  network are safe. Nevertheless, there is
   a risk of deny of service if a malicious IPv4 node initiates lot of
   connections to IPv6 node. This risk is mitigate by the reuse of the
   same  temporary  IPv4  address  by   the  IPv6  node  for  all  its
   simultaneous   communications  with  several   IPv4  nodes.  To  be
   successful such  an attack  must be conducted by a single IPv4 node
   against several  different IPv6 nodes.  This can be avoided  by the
   DSTM Server that MAY limit  the number of association for a  single
   IPv4 host.

5. Conclusion

   The use of neighbor discovery messages extensions allows an
   implementation of DSTM servers on a router. This simple mechanism,
   when implemented in DSTM router and DSTM host, will make DSTM a
   very simple to deploy and to operate, general purpose transition
   mechanism.
