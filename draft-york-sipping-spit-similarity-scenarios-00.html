Introduction</h3>

<p>If the administrator of a VoIP network suddenly noticed 10,000
	outbound SIP INVITE messages traversing the network in the space of
	a minute or two, could this be a spammer generating voice spam on
	the network?  Or could this be the legitimate triggering of an 
	emergency notification system?
</p>
<p>As outlined in the recently published RFC 5039 <a class='info' href='#RFC5039'>[RFC5039]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rosenberg, J. and C. Jennings, &ldquo;The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and Spam,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, communication using the Session Iniatiation Protocol 
	(SIP) could be a target for a form of spam commonly known as either
	"voice spam", "Spam for Internet Telephony" or simply "SPIT".
	Essentially, SPIT is the transmission of bulk unsolicited messages
	via SIP. It is telemarketing brought to the world of IP where the
	traditional costs and delays associated with telemarketing in the
	PSTN world are removed. Telemarketers can now very rapidly and
	inexpensively send out a very high volume of calls, which we might
	see as "spam". For reasons outlined in RFC 5039, SPIT attacks are 
	not yet widely seen, but can
	be expected as further interconnections occur between SIP systems.
</p>
<p>RFC 5039 and related Internet Drafts (<a class='info' href='#I-D.tschofenig-sipping-framework-spit-reduction'>[I&#8209;D.tschofenig&#8209;sipping&#8209;framework&#8209;spit&#8209;reduction]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Tschofenig, H., Schulzrinne, H., Wing, D., Rosenberg, J., and D. Schwartz, &ldquo;A Framework to tackle Spam and Unwanted Communication for Internet  Telephony,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a> and
	<a class='info' href='#I-D.niccolini-sipping-spitstop'>[I&#8209;D.niccolini&#8209;sipping&#8209;spitstop]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Niccolini, S. and J. Quittek, &ldquo;Signaling TO Prevent SPIT (SPITSTOP) Reference Scenario,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>) outline the
	potential threat of SPIT and also lay out suggestions for possible
	solutions. Beyond the potential solutions offered thus far, it is
	very conceivable that traditional network security vendors will
	seek to use existing tools to combat SPIT at a network traffic
	level. For instance, a system designed to monitor network traffic
	and trigger alerts based on anomolies seen in network traffic could
	be modified to look for anomolies in the base rate of SIP traffic.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to provide input into the
	ongoing discussions around preventing SPIT that highlights the fact that
	there are cases where legitimate SIP traffic may in fact look like SPIT.
	If the administrator of a VoIP network suddenly noticed 10,000
	outbound SIP INVITE messages traversing the network in the space of a
	minute or two, this could be SPIT being generated by a system
	connected to that VoIP network - or it could be an emergency
	notification system.
</p>
<p> Solutions to the potential problem of SPIT do
	need to take into account that some legitimate uses of SIP
	communication might resemble the launch of a SPIT session or indeed
	might resemble a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.  This document
	outlines some of those scenarios.
</p>
<p>It should be noted that the concern addressed in this document is 
	for the spammer who may generate a large amount of SIP traffic in a 
	short period of time and thus potentially come to the attention of
	network monitoring tools.
	This may be the case, for instance, when a spammer connects to
	another party's network (for instance, one using unprotected WiFi) and
	wants to send out the most messages in the least amount of time. A
	spammer may also simply be trying to send the messages out as fast
	as possible for one client in order to move on to other
	clients.
</p>
<p>Obviously a spammer could simply slow down the rate 
	of sending SIP messages to evade this type of detection. In that
	case the SPIT traffic would resemble normal SIP traffic and be
	subject to the concerns and potential solutions suggested in RFC
	5039 and other Internet-Drafts.
</p>
<p>NOTE: Reflecting the fact that SIP can be used for far more
	than voice, RFC 5039 discusses call spam, IM spam and presence
	spam. This document, however, primarily focuses on call spam.

Outbound SIP Scenarios</h3>

<p>Given the ease with which SIP systems can be connected to existing
	applications such as databases, creating a system to do large scale
	initiation of SIP messages is easy to do and both commercial and open 
	source implementations of such functionality exist today.
</p>
<p>Any system that generated a large amount of outbound SIP traffic
	might potentially be viewed as a generator of SPIT. This section
	breaks down those systems into several categories.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1"></a><h3>2.1.&nbsp;
Emergency Notification
		Systems</h3>

<p>In the wake of recent school shootings in the USA,
	    particularly the April 2007 event at Virginia Tech, academic
	    institutions at all levels are seeking technical solutions
	    which will allow them to do "emergency notification" on a
	    massive scale.  Such systems can be triggered by school
	    administrators or potentially public safety officials and
	    immediately begin notifying students, faculty and now even
	    parents.  Notification may take the form of phone calls, text
	    messages (SMS), IM messages or all of the above.
</p>
<p>Were such a system to be SIP-based, the triggering of the
	    system might result in the immediate flow of:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>SIP INVITE messages to phones, conceivably to every known
	       SIP endpoint on the campus
</li>
<li>SIP messages to PSTN gateways to initiate outbound calls
	       to regular phones
</li>
<li>SIP messages to SMS gateways to initiate outbound text
	       messages
</li>
<li>SIP messages to IM networks
</li>
</ul><p>If a university were to have, for instance, 10,000
	    students and several thousand more staff and faculty, an
	    extremely large number of SIP messages would be sent in a very
	    short time.
</p>
<p>It is important to note that in the case of an emergency
	    notification system, messages are typically extremely
	    time-sensitive and are looking for immediate delivery. There
	    also may be health, legal or at least public relations 
	    ramifications if the messages are blocked from delivery. There
	    will also typically be no notification of the triggering of
	    such a system and, hopefully, the system will almost never be
	    used. To the unaware system administrator just routinely monitoring
	    network traffic, this would be an extremely surprising event.
</p>
<p>Beyond usage in educational settings, emergency notification
	    systems like this are also be established in a variety of other
	    situations such as government alerts about impending weather
	    or natural events (ex. tornados, fires).
</p>

<table summary="layout" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" class="TOCbug" align="right"><tr><td class="TOCbug"><a href="#toc">&nbsp;TOC&nbsp;</a></td></tr></table>
<a name="rfc.section.2.2"></a><h3>2.2.&nbsp;
Urgent Notification Systems</h3>

<p>While not rising to the same level of criticality as
	    "emergency" systems, there are other "urgent" notification
	    systems that follow a similar profile.  Examples include:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Airline systems notifying travelers of delayed or
	       cancelled flights
</li>
<li>School systems notifying families of school delays or
	       cancellations
</li>
<li>Stock price change notifications
</li>
</ul><p>Again, the notification system may trigger on an
	    infrequent basis or go through seasonal cycles and may involve
	    a large number of calls. In some situations, such as a school
	    notification, the number of calls may be close to the same in each
	    event. For example, the number of student families to notify may
	    fluctuate slightly but typically not by much.  In other
	    situations the number of calls may vary widely. For example,
	    the number of calls to be made by an airline notification
	    system may depend upon how many people are traveling and how
	    many of those travelers provided contact information or
	    requested to be notified.. 
</p>
<a name="outbound-event"></a><br /><hr />
<table summary="layout" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" class="TOCbug" align="right"><tr><td class="TOCbug"><a href="#toc">&nbsp;TOC&nbsp;</a></td></tr></table>
<a name="rfc.section.2.3"></a><h3>2.3.&nbsp;
Event-Driven Notification Systems</h3>

<p>In a similar fashion to the previous scenarios, it is quite
	    conceivable that automated systems will be used by a wide
	    variety of organizations to alert people to impending events.
	    For instance, a professional sports team might use a system to
	    alert all the members of a fan club about an upcoming game. A
	    business group might remind all of its members about an
	    upcoming conference. A political campaign might call a list
	    reminding people to go out and vote.  The list of potential
	    users of such a system could be quite lengthy. Some examples
	    might be:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Professional sports teams
</li>
<li>School events
</li>
<li>Local theatres
</li>
<li>Business groups
</li>
<li>Town/city governments/associations
</li>
<li>Political campaigns
</li>
</ul><p>The key element here is that the calls might happen
		on an infrequent basis.  There might be a large number of
		calls made in a short period of time - and once the event
		is over there are no more calls made by that entity until
		the next similar event.
</p>
<a name="outbound-routine"></a><br /><hr />
<table summary="layout" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" class="TOCbug" align="right"><tr><td class="TOCbug"><a href="#toc">&nbsp;TOC&nbsp;</a></td></tr></table>
<a name="rfc.section.2.4"></a><h3>2.4.&nbsp;
Routine Notification Systems</h3>

<p>While the previous scenarios have outlined situations where
	    a large amount of traffic was generated with no warning, there
	    also exist a class of scenarios where a large amount of traffic
	    might be generated on a regular interval.  For instance, some
	    school systems in the USA are starting to use notification
	    systems to alert parents to events that have occurred that day
	    or will be occurring. They might receive a phone call each day stating
	    what homework their child had and/or informing them of a school
	    meeting occuring later in the week. With a large school district, 
	    the automated notification system might initiate thousands of calls 
	    every day at, for example, 3pm.
</p>
<p>Similarly, a movie theater might call every subscriber in a
	    special promotional club on every Thursday afternoon to let
	    them know what movies might be premiering during the upcoming
	    weekend.
</p>
<p>Again, there are a large number of potential users of such a
	    system.  The key difference in this scenario is that the
	    traffic may occur at a regular time and period. Security
	    systems that monitor network traffic might flag these
	    notification systems as potential sources of SPIT but conceivably 
	    those systems could be configured in such a way that this
	    notification traffic is incorporated into a network

Inbound SIP Scenarios</h3>

<p>In a similar fashion to outbound SIP scenarios, it is possible
	that sufficient legitimate inbound traffic to a SIP system/network might cause
	administrators or automated systems to believe they are receiving a
	large amount of voice spam/SPIT. For instance, if a system were on
	the receiving end of an emergency notification system (ex. an
	IP-PBX operated by a department within a university) a high level
	of SIP INVITE messages would be received that might go to all
	extensions on the system.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the system/network might be
	receiving calls due to a contest or other event (ex. an "American
	Idol"-type of show where people call in and vote or a radio station
	contest). Note, though, that in this situation the calls might be
	coming in from a range of different endpoints and could also
	resemble a Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service
	(DDos) attack.
</p>
<p>The primary difference from outbound scenarios is that with the
	inbound scenario the destination of all the traffic would typically
	be the SIP proxy/gateway for a given network.  Again, this may make
	differentiation between legitimate traffic and SPIT - or a DoS or
	DDoS - difficult.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
</h3>

<p>Similar to the Event-Driven outbound systems, there may be
	legitimate inbound calling due to specific *known* events. Examples
	include:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>"American Idol"-style TV shows
</li>
<li>Radio station listener contests, ticket giveaways, etc.
</li>
<li>Interview shows (Ex. "Call now to ask your mayor
		   questions about the school budget.")
</li>
<li>Advertising (Ex. "Call in the next 5 minutes to obtain
		   your copy of ____ for only $19.95!")
</li>
</ul><p>The major distinction here is that at some point it
 	is known that this traffic will be generated, in comparison to the
	section below.  For instance, the time when callers may be calling in
	to vote in the TV show will be known in advance. (Whether or not all
	systems in the path of the call will be alerted to this is a separate
	matter.)

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
</h3>

<p>Unexpected events such as those that might cause a significant
	amount of outbound calling (as outlined in the Emergency Notification
	Systems earlier) may also create a significant amount of *inbound*
	calling.  Such events include, but are certainly not limited to, such
	things as:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Natural disasters
</li>
<li>School shootings
</li>
<li>Large traffic accidents
</li>
<li>Bombings
</li>
</ul><p>Again the issue here is that these events are
	entirely unexpected and therefore the traffic entering a SIP network
	could very easily be viewed as a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;
Network Failures</h3>

<p>Another scenario to consider is the case where excessive amounts of SIP
    traffic are not the result of exceptional amounts of inbound or outbound
    calling but rather a failure in the actual network infrastructure. For
    instance, consider the case where there is a wide area network with
    multiple SIP-to-PSTN gateways and a large distributed infrastructure. An
    outage at specific points in the network might result in all the traffic
    for the larger network being routed through a single SIP signaling node.
    To the administrators of that node, the sudden influx of additional
    traffic might cause concern of a DoS or SPIT attack. One might hope that the
    administrators would also be able to easily ascertain the network status
    and understand why they are receiving this traffic, but that might not be
    possible in all network configurations.

<a name="rfc.section.5"></a><h3>5.&nbsp;
Other Considerations</h3>

<p>One logical reaction to these scenarios might be to suggest that
	the legitimate senders simply reduce their send rate to be below
	any timing thresholds that might trigger automated systems. For
	instance, if a system needing to contact 10,000 endpoints were to
	send one SIP INVITE every half-second, the INVITEs would then all
	go out over the space of a bit under 1.5 hours.  For some
	systems, such the "Routine Notification Systems" identified
	earlier, spacing out the INVITE messages might be fine and in fact 
	might actually be required in order for the media servers to keep
	with streaming the outbound media to all the invited endpoints.
	However, in other situations, such as emergency notification
	systems, some spacing out of INVITE messages may be possible but at
	some threshold any further delays may be unacceptable and indeed in 
	some cases could be life-threatening.

Summary</h3>

<p>Voice spam, also known as "SPIT", has the potential to be a
	serious problem if we move to a space where we have interconnected
	systems where any SIP endpoint can call any other SIP endpoint -
	and we do not have any mechanisms in place to prevent abuse of the
	system to generate large volumes of unsolicited calls. Solutions
	are being discussed and such work needs to be continued.
</p>
<p>In looking at potential solutions, it is important to
	recognize that there are legitimate cases where SIP systems may
	generate large volumes of calls in a rapid timeframe.  Any
	solutions to addressing the problem of SPIT do need to take into
	account these legitimate scenarios.
