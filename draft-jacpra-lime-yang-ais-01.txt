		 Yang Data Model for Loss Measurement
			draft-jacpra-lime-yang-ais-01

Abstract

This document presents a YANG Data model for Alarm Indication Signal.
The YANG Model presented in this document extends the generic YANG Data
Model for AIS to support OAM fault management.

1. Introduction

Generic OAM Yang model [GENYANGGOAM] presents Generic Yang data model for
all OAM technologies.In this document we extend the YANG model defined in 
[GENYANGGOAM] with AIS alarm indication singal.Details are provided in section 4 below.


2. Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC2119].The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined here:

o client

o configuration data

o server

o state data

The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined here:
o augment

o data model

The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in [RFC6020].


2.1. Terminology


MP - Maintenance Point [8021.Q]
MEP - Maintenance End Point [RFC7174] [8021Q] [RFC6371]
MIP - Maintenance Intermediate Point [RFC7174] [8021.Q] [RFC6371]
MA - Maintenance Association [8021.Q] [RFC7174]
MD - Maintenance Domain [8021.Q]
OAM - Operations, Administration, and Maintenance [RFC6291]


3.1. MEP Configuration Extension


3.1.1. AIS Configuration

This section describes a set of data definitions ais configuration. This set of 
data defintions augment the MEP configuration defined in the Generic YANG OAM model 
with parameters related to AIS and define the role of MEP and measurement method of 
the AIS.
