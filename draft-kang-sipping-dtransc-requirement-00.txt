Abstract 
 
   This document presents a set of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) 
   call control requirements that support communication with direct 
   transcoding capability. Several solutions are addressed for 
   transcoding service. 
    
   Direct transcoding requires two kinds of requirements: the service 
   requirement and call control requirement. Service requirement is no 
   constraint of codec adaptation and interoperability of models. Call

   control requirement is exchange of codec information and minimizing 
   of call set up delay. 
 
   The model might be applied to general-purpose services satisfying the 
   requirements of multimedia applications without an additional INVITE.

1. Introduction 
   
 
   Simple homogeneous terminals and special purpose terminals comprise 
   the majority of existing network terminals. Communication media is 
   getting more diverse in terms of the types of network terminals. 
   However, the era of new communication media types through several 
   kinds of network terminals such as hardware IP phones(POTS style, PDA 
   style, mobile phone style), software IP phones(special purpose 
   software phone, messenger phone, ITSP phone), POTS phones, ISDN 
   phones and mobile phones is coming. 
   We believe that transcoding services are a key solution to supporting 
   these types of communication in heterogeneous networks and different 
   capability terminals. 
   We want to use a service network transparency even though it has 
   wireline network, wireless network, internet, and broadcasting 
   network with a horizontal structure. 
    
   The IETF sipping WG has been developing two models for transcoding 
   services: Third Party Call Control Transcoding Model[4][6-7] and 
   Conference Bridge Transcoding Model[5]. The Third Party Call Control 
   Transcoding Model is suitable for advanced end points that are able 
   to perform third party call control. The Conference Bridge 
   Transcoding Model is suitable for a centralized conference. These two 
   models are useful for a specific application invoked rarely to 
   support deaf, hard of hearing and speech-impaired individuals[2].  
    
   We need another model that is useful for general application[8] 
   invoked frequently[9]. A transcoding function is needed in cases of 
   interworking between different networks with different codecs and 
   communicating between different applications (e.g., text and speech). 
 
 
2. Purpose and scope
    
 
   The direct transcoding requirements described within this document.  
 
 
3. Background 
   
 
   There are heterogeneous networks, media types and applications. Some 
   examples of heterogeneous networks are ones between PSTN and 
   3GPP/3GPP2, PSTN and Internet Telephony, or Internet Telephony and 
   3GPP/3GPP2. Examples of media types are a communication in real time 
   between voice and text, video/voice and voice, or video/voice and 
   text. Examples of applications are call forwarding and conference 
   call. 
    
   Codecs are adapted depending on networks, media types, and 
   applications. We need a transcoding requirement between different 
   codecs for global communication.

  There are several cases for call scenarios with codecs 
   
  1) Case with same codec between calling party and called party

   5) Case with transcoding processing in transit party 
    
         +-------+             +-------+             +-------+ 
         |       |<----SIP---->|       |<----SIP---->|       |

         |   a   |----Media----|a-b,a-c|----Media----|   c   | 
         +-------+             +-------+             +-------+ 
          
         Figure 5: Case with direct transcoding function 
    
   Case 1 has the most efficient media processing among the 5 cases. 
   Case 1 does not need transcoding because there is only one codec or 
   the same codec. 
    
   Case 2 can not connect a call due to codec mismatch. We should avoid 
   Case 2 during call setup stage. 
    
   Case 3 is a transcoding model by new INVITE to invoke transcoding in 
   the third party. 
    
   Case 4 is a transcoding model by re-INVITE to invoke transcoding in a 
   transit party. 
    
   Case 5 is a transcoding model by direct transcoding in a transit 
   party. 
    
    
   The Direct Transcoding Model, case 5, is a useful solution from the 
   point of ITSP(Internet Telephony Service Provider). In an ITSP 
   environment, all call control messages should be controlled by the 
   ITSP server, ITSP can provide service to terminals with all kinds of 
   codecs. ITSP media server has a transcoding function and call 
   control by itself. This model has the advantage of no additional 
   messages between nodes and no modification for SIP call set up 
   standard. 
 
   The Direct Transcoding Model can be one of the solutions to network 
   convergence of PSTN, mobile network, internet telephony, and digital 
   broadcasting TV. 
 
   The models are compared by signaling traffic overhead. The Conference 
   bridge model and the Third party transcoding server model need an 
   additional signaling procedure for transcoding service whenever they 
   are invoked. The additional signaling procedure includes an 
   additional INVITE procedure with SIP/SDP between invoking point and 
   serving point. Conference bridge model and Third party transcoding 
   server model are useful for environments that rarely occur for the 
   transcoding service.

4. Service Requirement 
  
 
   The user requirements in this section are provided for the benefit of 
   end user and the convergence network providers. 
    
    
4.1 No Constraint of Codec Adaptation 
    
 
   We should not restrict the use or choice of a specific codec. There 
   are several adaptable codecs by network, end user, and ITSP. 
    
   - The right of choice for codec by network 
   - The right of choice for codec by end user 
   - The right of choice for codec by ITSP 
 
   Networks have adapted a specific codec since the PSTN era; G.711 in 
   PSTN, AMR in GSM(3GPP), EVRC, QCELP or SMV in 3GPP. End users have 
   adopted any codec since internet phone; G.723.1, G.729, G.711, and 
   internet Low Bit Rate Codec (iLBC) Speech. ITSP tries to provide a 
   transcoding function for wider service coverage. It is possible to 
   communicate between users with a heterogeneous codec. 
    
   We should make a model for more successful call set up regardless of 
   different codecs between calling and called party. So, we can freely 
   choose codecs according to our preference. 
    
   Direct transcoding model should accept all kinds of codecs supported 
   by network, end user, or ITSP. 
 
 
4.2 Interoperability of Models 
    
 
   We can make a call flow with a sequence of transcoding models 
   according to a service requirement. The service requirements can be 
   provided by a third party server, a central controlling server, or an 
   intermediary provider. The available models are: 
 
   - No transcoding model 
   - 3pcc transcoding model 
   - Conference call transcoding model 
   - Direct transcoding model 
    
   The direct transcoding model should not affect the other transcoding 
   models; no transcoding model, 3pcc transcoding model, and conference 
   call transcoding model. Even though the models are different between 
   calling party and called party, direct transcoding model can 
   communicate to the other side supported by a different model without 
   any other requirements.

5. Call Control Requirement 
   
 
   The following is a detailed description of the transcoding call 
   control requirement. 
 
5.1 Exchange of codec information 
     
    
   Direct transcoding model should provide the below information to the 
   other side. 
    
   - a transcoding capability 
   - a discriminator for codec characteristics 
   - a preference order for codecs 
    
   The transit party should provide all transcoding capability to 
   calling party and called party during call set up procedures. This 
   minimizes codec mismatch call setup failure due to a lack of codec 
   negotiation information.  
    
   A discriminator for codec characteristics should provide the codec 
   information whether transcoded or not. The discriminator prevents re-
   transcoding or transcoding-cycling from occurring. The transcoding 
   can decrease the quality of codec, so the number of transcodings are 
   minimized if possible. 
    
   A preference order for codecs should be provided  by the other side 
   according to a codec quality. The preference is useful for codec 
   negotiation during the call set up. 


5.2 Minimizing of Call set up delay 
    
    
   End user requires connectivity, speed, and efficiency for internet 
   telephony. The requirements of call set up are:  
    
   - based on SIP and Offer/Answer 
   - no interaction with user 
   - minimize call set up delay due to transcoding 
   - minimize the number of call waiting states during call set up 
      procedure 
 
   Direct transcoding model should be applied the principle based on 
   SIP[1] and Offer/Answer[3]. The independence between the model and 
   SIP is useful for its self-development and re-use independently. 
    
   We need a model for various codecs without user interaction.

                   Direct Transcoding requirement           June 2005 
 
   Transcoding processing time should be minimized during the setup. If 
   we have to wait for a long time to setup another party, the 
   transcoding model will be useless. 
    
   The increase of call waiting states number for transcoding call set 
   up procedure make the network performance worse.
