Internet-Draft      Mandating use of IPv6 in examples         March 2016


1.  Introduction

   IPv6 is a successor of the legacy IPv4 protocol.  The expectation is
   that in the coming years/decades IPv6 will become a predominant
   protocol in the Internet.  It would be wise, therefore, to use IPv6
   in examples provided in the RFC.

1.1.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  Mandating use of IPv6 in examples in RFCs

   When there is a need to provide an example that makes use of IP
   addresses, address ranges or prefixes, all IETF documents MUST use
   IPv6, unless there is a specific limited case for IPv4 only.

   In these cases authors SHOULD use addresses from the IPv6 prefix
   reserved for documentation purposes [RFC3849]

   Authors MAY also provide examples for IPv4 protocol.

3.  Examples of use

   o  IPv6 address

   RFC 5952 [RFC5952] recommends to use the compressed format for IPv6
   address textual representation.  For instance, leading zeros MUST be
   suppressed, the use of the symbol "::" MUST be used to its maximum
   capability and the characters "a", "b", "c", "d", "e", and "f" in an
   IPv6 address MUST be represented in lowercase.

   So an address 2001:0db8:0a0b:12f0:0000:0000:0000:0001 in the examples
   will look like:

   2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1

   o  IPv6 address with a port number

   IPv6 addresses including a port number should be enclosed in brackets
   [RFC5952]:

   '[2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1]:21'

   o  IPv6 prefix

   The prefix is appended to the IPv6 address separated by a slash "/"
   character as recommended in [RFC4291]:

   2001:db8:a0b:12f0::1/64

4.  Acknowledgements

   This draft was inspired by a presentation by Russ White at NANOG 66
   that used IPv6 examples.
