          Internet Draft          SNMP over OSI                  July 92


          2.  Background

          The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as defined in
          [1] is now used as an integral part of the network management
          framework for TCP/IP-based internets.  Together with its
          companions standards, which define the Structure of Management
          Information (SMI) [2,3], and the Management Information Base
          (MIB) [4], the SNMP has received widespread deployment in many
          operational networks running the Internet suite of protocols.

          It should not be surprising that many of these sites might
          acquire OSI capabilities and may wish to leverage their
          investment in SNMP technology towards managing those OSI
          components.  This memo addresses these concerns by defining a
          framework for running the SNMP in an environment which
          supports the OSI connectionless-mode transport service.

          However, as noted in [5], the preferred mapping for SNMP is
          onto the UDP[6].  As such, this specification is intended for
          use in environments where UDP transport is not available.  No
          aspect of this specification should be construed as a
          suggestion that, in a heterogeneous transport environment, a
          managed agent should support more than one mapping.
          Conversely, management stations are strongly encouraged to
          support mappings of SNMP onto all popular transports.

          3.  Mapping onto the CLTS

          Mapping the SNMP onto the CLTS[7,8] is straight-forward.  The
          elements of procedure are identical to that of using the UDP.
          Note that the CLTS and the service offered by the UDP both
          transmit packets of information which contain full addressing
          information.  Thus, mapping the SNMP onto the CLTS, a
          "transport address" in the context of [1], is simply a
          transport-selector and network address.

          It should be noted that the mapping of SNMP onto a
          connectionless-mode transport service is wholly consistent
          with SNMP's architectural principles, as described in [1,5].
          However, the CLTS itself can be realized using either a
          connectionless-mode or a connection-oriented network service.
          The mapping described in this mapping allows for either
          realization.  (When both network services are available, the
          CLNS should be used as the basis of realization.)


          3.1.  Well-known Addresses

          Unlike the Internet suite of protocols, OSI does not use
          well-known ports.  Rather,
           demultiplexing occurs on the basis of "selectors", opaque
          strings of octets which have local significance.  In order to
          foster interoperable implementations of the SNMP over the
          CLTS, it is necessary define four selectors for this purpose.

          When the CLTS is used to provide the transport backing for the
          SNMP, and the CLTS uses a connectionless-mode network service,
          then transport selector used shall be "snmp-l" which consists
          of six ASCII characters; and, SNMP traps are, by convention,
          sent to an SNMP manager listening on the transport selector
          "snmpt-l" which consists of seven ASCII characters.

          When the CLTS is used to provide the transport backing for the
          SNMP, and the CLTS uses a connection-oriented network service,
          then transport selector used shall be "snmp-o" which consists
          of six ASCII characters; and, SNMP traps are, by convention,
          sent to an SNMP manager listening on the transport selector
          "snmpt-o" which consists of seven ASCII characters.

          3.2.  Traps

          When SNMP traps are sent over the CLTS, the agent-addr field
          in the Trap-PDU contains the IP-address "0.0.0.0" An SNMP
          manager may ascertain the source of the trap based on
          information provided by the transport service (i.e., from the
          T-UNIT-DATA.INDICATION primitive).


          3.3.  Maximum Message Size

          An entity implementing SNMP over OSI must be prepared to
          accept messages whose size is at least 484 octets.
          Implementation of larger values is encouraged whenever
          possible.


          3.4.  Party Information

          For use with the Party MIB [9], SNMP mapped onto the CLTS
          (using a CL-mode network service) is referenced as the
          "rfcXxxxlDomain".  Similarly, SNMP mapped onto the CLTS (using
          a CO-mode network service) is referenced as the
          "rfcXxxxoDomain".
