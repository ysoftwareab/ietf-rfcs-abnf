2. Introduction

   [SPPI] describes a structure for specifying policy information that
   can then be transmitted to a network device for the purpose of
   configuring policy at that device.  The model underlying this
   structure is one of well-defined provisioning classes and instances
   of these classes residing in a virtual information store called the
   Policy Information Base (PIB).

   One way to provision policy is by means of the COPS protocol [COPS]
   with the extensions for provisioning [COPS-PR].  This protocol
   supports multiple clients, each of which may provision policy for a
   specific policy domain such as QoS, virtual private networks, or
   security.

   As described in [COPS-PR], each client supports a non-overlapping
   and independent set of PIB modules.  However, some provisioning
   classes are common to all subject-categories (client-types) and need
   to be present in each.  This document presents a set of PRCs that
   are common to all clients that provision policy using COPS for
   Provisioning.


3. General PIB Concepts

3.1. Roles

   The policy to apply to an interface may depend on many factors such
   as immutable characteristics of the interface (e.g., ethernet or
   frame relay), the status of the interface (e.g., half or full
   duplex), or user configuration (e.g., branch office or headquarters
   interface). Rather than specifying policies explicitly for each
   interface of all devices in the network, policies are specified in
   terms of interface functionality.

   To describe these functionalities of an interface we use the concept
   of "roles". A role is simply a string that is associated with an
   interface. A given interface may have any number of roles
   simultaneously. Provisioning classes have an attribute called a
   "role-combination" which is a lexicographically ordered set of
   roles.  Instances of a given provisioning class are applied to an


                                                              [Page 2]

Framework Policy Information Base                       September 2000


   interface if and only if the set of roles in the role combination
   matches the set of the roles of the interface.

   Thus, roles provide a way to bind policy to interfaces without
   having to explicitly identify interfaces in a consistent manner
   across all network devices.  (The SNMP experience with ifIndex has
   proved this to be a difficult task.)  That is, roles provide a level
   of indirection to the application of a set of policies to specific
   interfaces. Furthermore, if the same policy is being applied to
   several interfaces, that policy need be pushed to the device only
   once, rather than once per interface, as long as the interfaces are
   configured with the same role combination.

   We point out that, in the event that the administrator needs to have
   unique policy for each interface, this can be achieved by
   configuring each interface with a unique role.

   The PEP reports all its role combinations to the PDP in the initial
   COPS request (REQ) message and in subsequent request messages
   generated in response to COPS state synchronization (SSQ) requests
   and local configuration changes.

   The comparing of roles (or role combinations) is case sensitive.

   By convention, when formatting the role-combination for exchange
   within a protocol message, within a PIB/MIB object's value, or as a
   printed value, the set is formatted in lexicographical order of the
   role's ASCII values; that is, the role that is first is formatted
   first. For example, "a+b" and "b+a" are NOT different role-
   combinations; rather, they are different formatting of the same
   role-combination, and hence for this example:
   - "a+b" is the valid formatting of that role-combination,
   - "b+a" is an invalid formatting of that role-combination.

   The role-combination of interfaces to which no roles have been
   assigned is known as the "null" role-combination.  (Note the
   deliberate use of lower-case letters for "null" so that it avoids
   confusion with the ASCII NULL character that has a value of zero but
   a length of one.)

   In an "install" or an "install-notify" class, the wildcard role-
   combination "*" can be used. In addition to providing for interface-
   specific roles, it also allows for other optimizations in reducing
   the number of role-combinations for which a policy has to be
   specified. For example:

   Suppose we have three interfaces:

     Roles A, B and R1 are assigned to interface I1
     Roles A, B and R2 are assigned to interface I2
     Roles A, B and R3 are assigned to interface I3



                                                              [Page 3]

Framework Policy Information Base                       September 2000





   Then, a PRI of a fictional IfDscpAssignTable that has the following
   values for its attributes:

     IfDscpAssignPrid    = 1
     IfDscpAssignRoles   = "*+A+B"
     IfDscpAssignName    = "4queues"
     IfDscpAssignDscpMap = 1

   will apply to all three interfaces, because "*" matches with R1, R2
   and R3.

   Formally,
   - The wildcard role is denoted by "*",
   - The "*" role is not allowed to be defined as part of the role-
     combination of an interface as notified by the PEP to the PDP; it
     is only allowed in policies installed/deleted via COPS-PR from
     the PDP to the PEP.
   - For a policy to apply to an interface when the policy's role-
     combination is "*+a+b", then the interface's role-combination:
         - Must include "a" and "b", and
         - Can include zero or more other roles.
   - The wildcard character "*" is listed before the other roles as
     "*" is lexicographically before "a"; however, the wildcard matches
     any zero or more roles, irrespective of lexicographical order.
     For example: "*+b+e+g" would match "a+b+c+e+f+g"

3.1.1. An Example

   The functioning of roles might be best understood by an example.
   Suppose I have a device with three interfaces, with roles as
   follows:

        IF1: "finance"
        IF2: "finance"
        IF3: "manager"

   Suppose, I also have a PDP with two policies:

        P1: Packets from finance department (role "finance") get DSCP 5
        P2: Packets from managers (role "manager") get DSCP 6

   To obtain policy, the PEP reports to the PDP that it has some
   interfaces with role combination "finance" and some with role
   combination "manager".  In response, the PDP downloads policy P1
   associated with role combination "finance" and downloads a second
   policy P2 associated with role combination "manager".

   Now suppose the finance person attached to IF2 is promoted to
   manager and so the system administrator adds the role "manager" to
   IF2. The PEP now reports to the PDP that it has three role

                                                              [Page 4]

Framework Policy Information Base                       September 2000


   combinations: some interfaces with role combination "finance", some
   with role combination "manager" and some with role combination
   "finance+manager".  In response, the PDP downloads an additional
   third policy associated with the new role combination
   "finance+manager".

   How the PDP determines the policy for this new role combination is
   entirely the responsibility of the PDP.  It could do so
   algorithmically or by rule.  For example, there might be a rule that
   specifies that manager policy takes preference over department
   policy.  Or there might be a third policy installed in the PDP as
   follows:

        P3: Packets from finance managers (role "finance" and role
            "manager") get DSCP 7

   The point here is that the PDP is required to determine what policy
   applies to this new role combination and to download a third policy
   to the PEP for the role combination "finance+manager" even if that
   policy is the same as one already downloaded.  The PEP is not
   required (or allowed) to construct policy for new role combinations
   from existing policy.

3.2. Multiple PIB Instances

   [COPS-PR] supports multiple, disjoint, independent instances of the
   PIB to represent multiple instances of configured policy.  The
   intent is to allow for the pre-provisioning of policy that can then
   be made active by a single, short decision from the PDP.

   A COPS context can be defined as an independent COPS request state
   for a particular subject category (client-type).

   With the COPS-PR protocol, each of these states are identified by a
   unique client handle.  The creation and deletion of these PIB
   instances is controlled by the PDP as described in [COPS-PR].

   Although many PIB instances may be configured on a device (the
   maximum number of these instances being determined by the device
   itself) only one of them can be active at any given time, the active
   one being selected by the PDP.  To facilitate this selection, the
   Framework PIB supports an attribute to make a PIB instance the
   active one and, similarly, to report the active PIB instance to the
   PDP in a COPS request message. This attribute is in the Incarnation
   Table described below.

   Setting the attribute FrwkPibIncarnationActive to 'true' in one PIB
   instance MUST ensure that the attribute is 'false' in all other
   contexts.





                                                              [Page 5]

3.3. Reporting of Device Capabilities

   Each network device providing policy-based services has its own
   inherent capabilities.  These capabilities can be hardware specific,
   e.g., an ethernet interface supporting input classification, or can
   be statically configured, e.g., supported queuing disciplines.
   These capabilities are communicated to the PDP when initial policy
   is requested by the PEP. Knowing device capabilities, the PDP can
   send the provisioning instances (PRIs) relevant to the specific
   device, rather than sending the entire PIB.

   The PIB indicates which capabilities the PEP must report to the PDP
   by means of the PIB-ACCESS clause as described in [SPPI].

3.4. Reporting of Device Limitations

   To facilitate efficient policy installation, it is important to
   understand a device's limitations in relation to the advertised
   device capabilities. Limitations may be class-based, e.g., an
   "install" class is supported as a "notify" or only a limited number
   of class instances may be created, or attribute-based. Attribute
   limitations, such as supporting a restricted set of enumerations or
   requiring related attributes to have certain values, detail
   implementation limitations at a fine level of granularity.

   A PDP can avoid certain installation issues in a proactive fashion
   by taking into account a device's limitations prior to policy
   installation rather than in a reactive mode during installation. As
   with device capabilities, device limitations are communicated to the
   PDP when initial policy is requested.

   Reported device limitations may be accompanied by guidance values
   that can be used by a PDP to determine acceptable values for the
   identified attributes.


4. Summary of the Framework PIB

   The Framework PIB comprises of three groups:

   1. Base PIB classes Group

      This contains PRCs intended to describe the PRCs supported
      by the PEP, PRC and/or attribute limitations and its current
      configuration.

      PRC Support Table

        As the technology evolves, we expect devices to be enhanced
        with new PIBs, existing PIBs to add new PRCs and existing PRCs
        to be augmented or extended with new attributes.  Also, it is
        likely that some existing PRCs or individual attributes of PRCs
        will be deprecated. The PRC Support Table describes the PRCs

                                                              [Page 6]

Framework Policy Information Base                       September 2000


        that the device supports as well as the individual attributes
        of each PRC.  Using this information the PDP can potentially
        tailor the policy to more closely match the capabilities of the
        device. The PRC Support Table instances are specific to the
        particular Subject Category (Client-Type). That is, the PRC
        Support Table for Subject Category 'A' will not include
        instances for classes supported by the Subject Category 'B'.

      PIB Incarnation Table

        This table contains exactly one row (corresponding to one PRI)
        per context.  It identifies the PDP that was the last to
        download policy into the device and also contains an identifier
        to identify the version of the policy currently downloaded.
        This identifier, both its syntax and value, is meaningful only
        to the PDPs.  It is intended to be a mechanism whereby a PDP,
        on connecting to a PEP, can easily identify a known incarnation
        of policy. The incarnation PRC also includes an attribute to
        indicate which context is the active one at the present time.

      Component Limitations Table

        Some devices may not be able to implement the full range of
        values for all attributes.  In principle, each PRC supports a
        set of errors that the PEP can report to the PDP in the event
        that the specified policy is not implementable.  There are two
        problems with this: it may be preferable for the PDP to be
        informed of the device limitations before actually attempting
        to install policy, and while the error can indicate that a
        particular attribute value is unacceptable to the PEP, this
        does not help the PDP ascertain which values would be
        acceptable. To alleviate these limitations, the PEP can report
        some limitations of attribute values and/or classes in the
        Component Limitations Table.

      Device Identification Table

        This class contains a single provisioning instance that
        contains device-specific information that is used to facilitate
        efficient policy installation by a PDP. The instance of this
        class is reported to the PDP in a COPS request message so that
        the PDP can take into account certain device characteristics
        during policy installation.

   2. Device Capabilities group

      This group contains the PRCs that describe the characteristics of
      interfaces of the device and the Role Combinations assigned to
      them.

      Interface Capabilities Set Table

        The interfaces the PEP supports are described by rows in

                                                              [Page 7]

Framework Policy Information Base                       September 2000


        this table (frwkIfCapSetTable).  Each row, or instance of this
        class, assigns a name to the interface and has references to
        capabilities that the interface supports. The references can
        specify instances in relevant capability tables in any PIB. The
        PEP notifies the PDP of these interface names and capabilities
        and then the PDP configures the interfaces, per role
        combination.

      Interface Capability and Role Combo Table

        The Interface Capabilities Set Table describes the interfaces
        the PEP supports by their capabilities. Configuration is done
        in terms of these interface capability set names (ifCapSetName)
        and the role combinations assigned to them; The PDP does not
        deal with individual interfaces on the device. Each row of this
        class is a <interface capability set name, Role Combo>
        two-tuple.

   3. Classifier group

         This group contains the IP and IEEE 802 Classifier elements.
         The set of tables consist of a Base Filter table that contains
         the Index InstanceId and the Permit flag for the filter. This
         frwkBaseFilterTable is extended to form the IP Filter table
         and the 802 Filter table.

         The Extended classes do not have a separate Index value.
         Instances of the extended classes have the same indices as
         their base class instance. Inheritance is achieved using the
         EXTENDS keyword as defined in [SPPI]. The Filter Group
         Definition table uses ReferenceId Textual Convention semantics
         to reference filter instances and TagId and TagReferenceId
         Textual Convention semantics [SPPI] to form sets of filters
         that could be referenced by some other association table
         instance.

           For example, an implementation of the frwkIpFilter class may
           be limited in several ways, such as address mask, protocol
           and Layer 4 port options. These limitations could be
           exported using this table with the following instances:

           Component                   Type
          --------------------------------------------------
           'frwkIpFilterDstAddrMask'  'attrValueSupLimited'
           'frwkIpFilterSrcAddrMask'  'attrValueSupLimited'
           'frwkIpFilterProtocol'     'attrValueSupLimited'
           'frwkIpFilterProtocol'     'attrValueSupLimited'
           'frwkIpFilterDstL4PortMin' 'invalidDstL4PortData'
           'frwkIpFilterDstL4PortMax' 'invalidDstL4PortData'
           'frwkBaseFilterPermit'     'attrEnumSupLimited'

           The above entries describe a number of limitations that
           may be in effect for the frwkIpFilter class on a given
           device. The limitations include restrictions on acceptable
           values for certain attributes and indications of the
           relationship between related attributes.

           Also, an implementation of a PRC may be limited in the ways
           it can be accessed. For instance:
           Component                   Type
          --------------------------------------------------
           'DscpMapEntry'              'priNotifyOnly'

           If the errors defined in the INSTALL-ERRORS section are not
           generic Class-Specific errors (in the example,
           'invalidDstL4PortData') then the Error code sent must be
           'priSpecificError'[COPS-PR] and the Sub-Error code must
           contain the enumeration value from the INSTALL-ERRORS
           section for the PRC (in the example, the enumeration value
           for 'invalidDstL4PortData') [SPPI]."

   6. Security Considerations

   It is clear that this PIB is used for configuration using [COPS-PR],
   and anything that can be configured can be misconfigured, with
   potentially disastrous effect. At this writing, no security holes
   have been identified beyond those that the COPS base protocol
   security is itself intended to address. These relate primarily to
   controlled access to sensitive information and the ability to
   configure a device - or which might result from operator error,
   which is beyond the scope of any security architecture.

   There are a number of provisioning classes defined in this PIB that
   have a PIB-ACCESS clause of install (read-create). Such objects may
   be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   The support for "Install" decisions sent over [COPS-PR] in a non-
   secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations. There are a number of provisioning
   classes in this PIB that may contain information that may be
   sensitive from a business perspective, in that they may represent a
   customer's service contract or the filters that the service provider
   chooses to apply to a customer's ingress or egress traffic. There
   are no PRCs that are sensitive in their own right, such as passwords
   or monetary amounts. It may be important to control even
   "Notify"(read-only) access to these PRCs and possibly to even
   encrypt the values of these PRIs when sending them over the network
   via COPS-PR. Even if the network itself is secure (for example by
   using IPSec), there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to "Install/Notify" (read/change/create/delete) the PRIs in
   this PIB. It is recommended that the implementers consider the
   security features as provided by the COPS base protocol.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the PEP/PDP
   giving access to an instance of this PIB, is properly configured to
   give access to the PRIs only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to indeed "Install" or "Notify" (change/create/
   delete) them. The use of IPSEC between the PDP and the PEP, as
   described in [COPS], provides the necessary protection against
   security threats.
