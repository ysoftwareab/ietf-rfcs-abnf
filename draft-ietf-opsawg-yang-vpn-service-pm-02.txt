    A YANG Model for Network and VPN Service Performance Monitoring
                draft-ietf-opsawg-yang-vpn-service-pm-02

Abstract

   The data model for network topologies defined in RFC 8345 introduces
   vertical layering relationships between networks that can be
   augmented to cover network and service topologies.  This document
   defines a YANG module for performance monitoring (PM) of both
   networks and VPN services that can be used to monitor and manage
   network performance on the topology at higher layer or the service
   topology between VPN sites.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8969] describes a framework for automating service and network
   management with YANG models.  It proposes that the performance
   measurement telemetry model to be tied with the service, such as
   Layer 3 VPN and Layer 2 VPN, or network models to monitor the overall
   network performance or Service Level Agreements (SLA).

   The performance of VPN services is associated with the performance
   changes of the underlay network that carries VPN services, such as
   the delay of the underlay tunnels and the packet loss status of the
   device interfaces.  Additionally, the integration of Layer 2/Layer 3

Internet-Draft       Network and VPN Service PM YANG        January 2022


   VPN performance and network performance data enables the orchestrator
   to subscribe to VPN service performance in a unified manner.
   Therefore, this document defines a YANG module for both network and
   VPN service performance monitoring (PM).  The module can be used to
   monitor and manage network performance on the topology level or the
   service topology between VPN sites, in particular.

   This document does not introduce new metrics for network performance
   or mechanisms for measuring network performance, but uses the
   existing mechanisms and statistics to display the performance
   monitoring statistics at the network and service layers.  All these
   metrics are defined as unidirectional metrics.

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed as an
   augmentation to the network topology YANG model defined in [RFC8345]
   and draws on relevant YANG types defined in [RFC6991], [RFC8345],
   [RFC8532], and [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].

   Appendix A provides a set of examples to illustrate the use of the
   module.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are used in this
   specification:

   *  augment

   *  data model

   *  data node

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

   The tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined
   in [RFC8340].

3.  Network and VPN Service Performance Monitoring Model Usage

   Models are key for automating network management operations.
   According to [RFC8969], together with service and network models,
   performance measurement telemetry models are needed to monitor
   network performance to meet specific service requirements (typically
   captured in an SLA).

                   Figure 1: Reference Architecture

   As shown in Figure 1, in the context of layering model architecture
   described in [RFC8309], the network and VPN service performance
   monitoring (PM) model can be used to expose a set of performance
   information to the above layer.  Such information can be used by an
   orchestrator to subscribe to performance data.  The network
   controller will then notify the orchestrator about corresponding
   parameter changes.

   Before using the network and VPN service PM model, the mapping
   between the VPN service topology and the underlying physical network
   should be set up.

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to derive VPN or
   network level performance data based on lower-level data collected
   via monitoring counters of the involved devices.  The performance
   monitoring data per link in the underlying network can be collected
   using a network performance measurement method such as MPLS Loss and
   Delay Measurement [RFC6374].  The performance monitoring information
   reflecting the quality of the network or VPN service (e.g., end-to-
   end network performance data between source node and destination node
   in the network or between VPN sites) can be computed and aggregated,
   for example, using the information from the Traffic Engineering
   Database (TED), [RFC7471] [RFC8570] [RFC8571] or LMAP [RFC8194].

Internet-Draft       Network and VPN Service PM YANG        January 2022


   The measurement and report intervals that are associated with these
   performance data usually depend on the configuration of the specific
   measurement method or collection method or various combinations.
   This document defines a network-wide measurement interval to align
   measurement requirements for networks or VPN services.

   In addition, the amount of performance data collected from the
   devices can be huge.  To avoid receiving a large amount of
   operational data of VPN instances, VPN interfaces, or tunnels, the
   network controller can specifically subscribe to metric-specific data
   using the tagging methods defined in [I-D.ietf-netmod-node-tags].

3.1.  Collecting Data via Pub/Sub Mechanism

   Some applications such as service-assurance applications, which must
   maintain a continuous view of operational data and state, can use the
   subscription model specified in[RFC8641] to subscribe to the specific
   network performance data or VPN service performance data they are
   interested in, at the data source.

   The data source can, then, use the network and VPN service assurance
   model defined in this document and the YANG Push model [RFC8641] to
   distribute specific telemetry data to target recipients.

3.2.  Collecting Data via Retrieval Methods

   To obtain a snapshot of a large amount of performance data from a
   network element (including network controllers), service-assurance
   applications may use methods such as retrieving performance data or
   RPC commands defined as part of YANG models.

4.  Description of The Data Model

   This document defines the YANG module, "ietf-network-vpn-pm", which
   is an augmentation to the "ietf-network" and "ietf-network-topology".

   The performance monitoring data augments the service topology as
   shown in Figure 2.

4.1.  Layering Relationship between Multiple Layers of Topology

   [RFC8345] defines a YANG data model for network/service topologies
   and inventories.  The service topology described in [RFC8345]
   includes the virtual topology for a service layer above Layer 1 (L1),
   Layer 2 (L2), and Layer 3 (L3).  This service topology has the
   generic topology elements of node, link, and terminating point.  One
   typical example of a service topology is described in Figure 3 of
   [RFC8345]: two VPN service topologies instantiated over a common L3
   topology.  Each VPN service topology is mapped onto a subset of nodes
   from the common L3 topology.

   Figure 3 illustrates an example of a topology that maps between the
   VPN service topology and an underlying network:

                     VPN 1                       VPN 2

      Figure 3: Example of Topology Mapping Between VPN Service
                   Topology and Underlying Network

   As shown in Figure 3, two VPN services topologies are both built on
   top of one common underlying physical network:

   VPN 1:  This service topology supports hub-spoke communications for
      'customer 1' connecting the customer's access at three sites:
      'Site-1A', 'Site-1B', and 'Site-1C'.  These sites are connected to
      nodes that are mapped to node 1 (N1), node 2 (N2), and node 4 (N4)
      in the underlying physical network.  'Site-1A' plays the role of
      hub while 'Site-1B' and 'Site-1C' are configured as spoke.

   VPN 2:  This service supports any-to-any communications for 'customer
      2' connecting the customer's access at two sites: 'Site-2A' and
      'Site-2B'.  These sites are connected to nodes that are mapped to
      nodes 1 (N1) and node 3 (N3)5 in the underlying physical network.
      'Site-2A' and 'Site-2B' have 'any-to-any' role.


4.2.  Network Level

   For network performance monitoring, the container of "networks" in
   [RFC8345] does not need to be extended.

   For VPN service performance monitoring, the container "service-type"
   is defined to indicate the VPN type, e.g., L3VPN or Virtual Private
   LAN Service (VPLS).  The values are taken from
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].  When a network topology instance
   contains the L3VPN or other L2VPN network type, it represents a VPN
   instance that can perform performance monitoring.

   The tree in Figure 4 is a part of ietf-network-vpn-pm tree.  It
   defines the following set of network level attributes:

   "vpn-id":  Refers to an identifier of VPN service defined in
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common]).  This identifier is used to
      correlate the performance status with the network service
      configuration.

   "vpn-service-topology":  Indicates the type of the VPN topology.
      This model supports "any-to-any", "Hub and Spoke" (where Hubs can
      exchange traffic), and "Hub and Spoke disjoint" (where Hubs cannot
      exchange traffic) that are taken from
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].  These VPN topology types can be
      used to describe how VPN sites communicate with each other.

4.3.  Node Level

   The tree in Figure 5 is the node part of ietf-network-vpn-pm tree.

   For network performance monitoring, a container of "pm-attributes" is
   augmented to the list of "node" that are defined in [RFC8345].  The
   "node-type" indicates the device type of Provider Edge (PE), Provider
   (P) device, or Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR), so that the
   performance metric between any two nodes each with specific node type
   can be reported.

   For VPN service performance monitoring, the model defines the
   following minimal set of node level network topology attributes:

   "role":  Defines the role in a particular VPN service topology.  The
      roles are taken from [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common] (e.g., any-to-
      any-role, spoke-role, hub-role).

   "vpn-summary-statistics":  Lists a set of IPv4 statistics, IPv6
      statistics, and MAC statistics.  These statistics are specified
      separately.

        Figure 6: Link and Termination point Level YANG Tree of the
                                hierarchies

   For the data nodes of 'link' depicted in Figure 6, the YANG module
   defines the following minimal set of link-level performance
   attributes:

   Percentile parameters:  The module supports reporting delay and
      jitter metric by percentile values.  By default, low percentile
      (10th percentile), mid percentile (50th percentile), high
      percentile (90th percentile) are used.  Setting a percentile to
      0.00 indicates the client is not interested in receiving
      particular percentile.  If all percentile nodes are set to 0.00,
      this represents that no percentile related nodes will be reported
      for a given performance metric (e.g., one-way delay, one-way delay
      variation) and only peak/min values will be reported.  For
      example, a client can inform the server that it is interested in
      receiving only high percentiles.  Then for a given link, at a
      given "reference-time" and "measurement-interval", the 'high-
      delay-percentile' and 'high-jitter-percentile' will be reported.
      An example to illustrate the use of percentiles is provided in
      Appendix A.3.

   PM source ("pm-source"):  Indicates the performance monitoring
      source.  The data for the topology link can be based, e.g., on
      BGP-LS [RFC8571].  The statistics of the VPN abstract links can be
      collected based upon VPN OAM mechanisms, e.g., OAM mechanisms
      specified in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm], or Ethernet service OAM
      specified in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l2nm].  Alternatively, the data can
      be based upon the underlay technology OAM mechanisms, for example,
      GRE tunnel OAM.

   Measurement interval ("measurement-interval"):  Specifies the
      performance measurement interval, in seconds.

   Reference time ("reference-time"):  Indicates the start time of the
      performance measurement for link statistics.  For termination
      point metrics, this parameter indicates the timestamp when the
      counters are obtained.

   Loss statistics:  A set of one-way loss statistics attributes that
      are used to measure end to end loss between VPN sites or between
      any two network nodes.  The exact loss value or the loss
      percentage can be reported.

   Delay statistics:  A set of one-way delay statistics attributes that
      are used to measure end to end latency between VPN sites or
      between any two network nodes.  The peak/min values or percentile
      values can be reported.

   Jitter statistics:  A set of one-way IP Packet Delay Variation
      [RFC3393] statistics attributes that are used to measure end to
      end jitter between VPN sites or between any two network nodes.
      The peak/min values or percentile values can be reported.

Internet-Draft       Network and VPN Service PM YANG        January 2022


   VPN underlay transport type ("vpn-underlay-transport-type"):  Indicat
      es the abstract link protocol-type of a VPN, such as GRE or IP-in-
      IP.  The leaf refers to an identifier of the "underlay-transport"
      defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common], which describes the
      transport technology to carry the traffic of the VPN service.

   VPN PM statistics ("vpn-unidirectional-pm-statistics"):  Lists
      performance measurement statistics for the abstract underlay link
      between VPN PEs with given "class-id" names.  The list is defined
      separately from "one-way-pm-statistics", which is used to collect
      generic metrics for unspecified "class-id" names.

   For the data nodes of 'termination-point' depicted in Figure 6, the
   module defines the following minimal set of statistics:

   Inbound statistics:  A set of inbound statistics attributes that are
      used to measure the inbound statistics of the termination point,
      such as received packets, received packets with errors, etc.

   Outbound statistics:  A set of outbound statistics attributes that
      are used to measure the outbound statistics of the termination
      point, such as sent packets, packets that could not be sent due to
      errors, etc.

   VPN network access ("vpn-network-access"):  Lists counters of the VPN
      network access defined in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm] or
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l2nm].  When multiple VPN network accesses are
      created using the same physical port, finer-grained metrics can be
      monitored.

5.  Network and VPN Service Performance Monitoring YANG Module

   The "ietf-network-vpn-pm" module uses types defined in [RFC8345],
   [RFC6991], [RFC8532], and [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common].

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document MAY be accessed via the
   RESTCONF protocol [RFC8040] or NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The
   lowest RESTCONF or NETCONF layer requires that the transport-layer
   protocol provides both data integrity and confidentiality, see
   Section 2 in [RFC8040] and [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is
   the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

Internet-Draft       Network and VPN Service PM YANG        January 2022


   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees with the write
   operation that can be exploited to impact the network monitoring:

   *  "/nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types"

   *  "/nw:networks/nw:network/nvp:vpn-pm-attributes"

   *  "/nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/nvp:pm-attributes"

   *  /nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link/nvp:pm-attributes"

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The nodes
   reveals the quality of a service that is operated by an operator.  It
   is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config,
   or notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and
   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   *  "/nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/nvp:pm-attributes/nvp:vpn-
      summary-statistics": Unauthorized access to this subtree can
      disclose the operational state information of VPN instances.

   *  "/nw:networks/nw:network/nt:link/nvp:pm-attributes/nvp:one-way-pm-
      statistics": Unauthorized access to this subtree can disclose the
      operational state information of network links or VPN underlay
      tunnels.

   *  "/nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/nt:termination-point/nvp:pm-
      statistics": Unauthorized access to this subtree can disclose the
      operational state information of network termination points or VPN
      network accesses.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-vpn-pm
      Registrant Contact: The IESG.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

Appendix A.  Illustrating Examples


A.1.  Example of Pub/Sub Retrieval

   The example shown in Figure 7 illustrates how a client subscribes to
   the performance monitoring information between nodes ('node-id') A
   and B in the L3 network topology.  The performance monitoring
   parameter that the client is interested in is end-to-end loss.

A.2.  Example of RPC-based Retrieval

   This example, depicted in Figure 8, illustrates how a client can use
   the RPC model to fetch performance data on demand.  For example, the
   client requests "packet-loss-count" between 'source-node' A and
   'dest-node' B that belong to the same VPN ('VPN1').
