Abstract

   The INFO extention method for SIP is introduced in RFC2976 [1], which
   is base on RFC2543.  Since RFC2543 is obsoleted by RFC3261 [3], It is
   suggested to update RFC2976 to conform to RFC3261.

1.  Introduction

   The INFO extention method for SIP is introduced in RFC2976 which is
   base on RFC2543.  Since RFC2543 is obsoleted by RFC3261 long back, it
   is suggested to update RFC2976 to conform to RFC3261.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3.  Update Suggestion

   Most of the modification are just to conform to the latest SIP rfc,
   some of them are technical related.

      Mod 1: References should be linked to RFC3261.

      Mod 2: The notation and concept of dialog, including early dialog,
      should be incorporated.

      Mod 3: Whether the functioin of INFO can be released to form an
      outside-dialog transaction should be addressed.

      Mod 4: Since the wide usage of INFO for some application, e.g.
      media control, is defecto to some extent, the general mechanism to
      solve the problems for the extention usage of INFO mentioned in
      RFC2976 may be discussed here.
