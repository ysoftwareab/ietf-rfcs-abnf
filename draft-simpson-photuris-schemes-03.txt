Abstract

   Photuris is a session-key management protocol.  Extensible Exchange-
   Schemes are provided to enable future implementation changes without
   affecting the basic protocol.

   Additional authentication attributes are included for use with the IP
   Authentication Header (AH).

   Additional confidentiality attributes are included for use with the
   IP Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP).

1.  Additional Exchange-Schemes

   The packet format and basic facilities are already defined for Pho-
   turis [RFC-zzzz].

   These optional Exchange-Schemes are specified separately, and no sin- |
   gle implementation is expected to support all of them.

   This document defines the following values:

   (3)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 3.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero, |
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.

         An Exchange-Scheme Size of zero is invalid.                     |

         The Key-Generation-Function is "MD5 Hash".

         The Privacy-Method is "Simple Masking".

         The Validity-Method is "MD5-KMpKp Check".

         This combination of features requires a modulus with at least   +
         64-bits of cryptographic strength.

   (4)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 2.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero, |
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.

         When the Exchange-Scheme Size field is zero, includes by refer- |
         ence all of the moduli specified in the list of Offered-Schemes |
         for Scheme #2.                                                  |

         The Key-Generation-Function is "MD5 Hash".

         The Privacy-Method is "DES-CBC over Mask".

         The Validity-Method is "MD5-KMpKp Check".

         This combination of features requires a modulus with at least   +
         64-bits of cryptographic strength.

   (5)   Implementation Optional.  Any modulus (p) with a recommended
         generator (g) of 5.  When the Exchange-Scheme Size is non-zero, |
         the modulus is contained in the Exchange-Scheme Value field in
         the list of Offered-Schemes.

2.  Additional Key-Generation-Function
2.1.  SHA1 Hash

   SHA1 [FIPS-180-1] is used as a pseudo-random-function for generating
   the key(s).  The key(s) begin with the most significant bits of the
   hash.  SHA1 is iterated as needed to generate the requisite length of
   key material.

   When an individual key does not use all 160-bits of the last hash,    |
   any remaining unused (least significant) bits of the last hash are
   discarded.  When combined with other uses of key generation for the
   same purpose, the next key will begin with a new hash iteration.

3.  Additional Privacy-Methods
3.1.  DES-CBC over Mask

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Privacy-Key Computation", sufficient pri- |
   vacy-key material is generated to match the message length, beginning
   with the next field after the SPI, and including the Padding.  The
   message is masked by XOR with the privacy-key.

   Then, the Key-Generation-Function is iterated to generate a DES key.  |
   The most significant 64-bits (8 bytes) of the generated hash are used
   for the privacy-key, and the remainder are discarded.  Although
   extremely rare, the 64 weak, semi-weak, and possibly weak keys
   [Schneier95, pages 280-282] are discarded.  The Key-Generation-       |
   Function is iterated until a valid key is obtained.

   The least significant bit of each key byte is ignored (or set to par-
   ity when the implementation requires).

   Message encryption begins with the next field after the SPI, and con-
   tinues to the end of the data indicated by the UDP Length.


3.2.  DES-EDE3-CBC over Mask

   This is "Triple DES" outer-CBC EDE encryption (and DED decryption)
   with three 56-bit keys [KR96].

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Privacy-Key Computation", sufficient pri- |
   vacy-key material is generated to match the message length, beginning
   with the next field after the SPI, and including the Padding.  The
   message is masked by XOR with the privacy-key.

   Then, the Key-Generation-Function is iterated (at least) three times  |
   to generate the three DES keys.  The most significant 64-bits (8
   bytes) of each generated hash are used for each successive privacy-
   key, and the remainder are discarded.  Each key is examined sequen-
   tially, in the order used for encryption.  A key that is identical to
   a previous key MUST be discarded.  Although extremely rare, the 64
   weak, semi-weak, and possibly weak keys [Schneier95, pages 280-282]
   MUST be discarded.  The Key-Generation-Function is iterated until a   |
   valid key is obtained before generating the next key.

   In all three keys, the least significant bit of each key byte is
   ignored (or set to parity when the implementation requires).

   Message encryption begins with the next field after the SPI, and con-
   tinues to the end of the data indicated by the UDP Length.

4.  Additional Validity-Method
4.1.  SHA1-KMpKp Check

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Validity Verification", the SHA1
   [FIPS-180-1] hash is calculated over the concatenation of

      SHA1( key, data, datafill, key, sha1fill )

   where the key is the computed shared-secret.

   The leading key is not padded to any particular alignment.

   The datafill uses the same pad-with-length technique defined for
   sha1fill.  This padding and length is implicit, and does not appear
   in the datagram.  The datafill length includes only the leading key
   and data.

   The resulting Verification field is a 160-bit Variable Precision Num-
   ber (22 bytes including Size).


5.  Additional Attributes

   The attribute format and basic facilities are already defined for
   Photuris [RFC-zzzz].

   These optional attributes are specified separately, and no single
   implementation is expected to support all of them.

   This document defines the following values:

     Use    Type
      I       4  SHA1-KMpKp Symmetric Identification
      X       6  SHA1-KpMpKp Authentication
      E       8  DES-CBC Encryption
      E       9  DES Decryption

   Attribute        4

   Length           0

   When selected as an Identity-Choice, the immediately following Iden-
   tification field contains an unstructured Variable Precision Number.
   Valid Identifications and symmetric secret-keys are preconfigured by
   the parties.

   There is no required format or content for the Identification value.
   The value may be a number or string of any kind.  See [RFC-zzzz] "Use
   of Identification and Secrets" for details.

   The authentication symmetric secret-key (as specified) is selected
   based on the contents of the Identification field.  All implementa-
   tions MUST support at least 62 bytes.  The selected symmetric secret-
   key SHOULD provide at least 80-bits of cryptographic strength.

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Identity Verification", the SHA1
   [FIPS-180-1] hash is calculated over the concatenation of:

      SHA1( key, data, datafill, key, sha1fill )

   where the key is the computed shared-secret.

   The leading key is not padded to any particular alignment.

   The datafill uses the same pad-with-length technique defined for
   sha1fill.  This padding and length is implicit, and does not appear
   in the datagram.  The datafill length includes only the leading key
   and data.

   The resulting Verification field is a 160-bit Variable Precision Num-
   ber (22 bytes including Size).

   For both identity verification and session-key calculation, the
   authentication symmetric secret-key is used as the calculation
   secret-key.

   May be selected as an AH or ESP Attribute-Choice, pursuant to
   [RFC-1852] et sequitur.  The selected Exchange-Scheme SHOULD provide  |
   at least 80-bits of cryptographic strength.

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Session-Key Computation", the most sig-   |
   nificant 384-bits (48 bytes) of the Key-Generation-Function itera-    |
   tions are used for the key.

   Profile:

      When negotiated with Photuris, the transform differs slightly from
      [RFC-1852].

      The form of the authenticated message is:

         SHA1( key, keyfill, datagram, datafill, key, sha1fill )

      where the key is the SPI session-key.

      The additional datafill protects against the attack described in
      [PO96].  This is also filled to the next 512-bit boundary, using
      the same pad-with-length technique defined for SHA1.  This padding
      and length is implicit, and does not appear in the datagram.  The
      datafill length includes only the leading key and data.

   May be selected as an ESP Attribute-Choice, pursuant to [RFC-1829] et
   sequitur.  The selected Exchange-Scheme SHOULD provide at least       |
   56-bits of cryptographic strength.

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Session-Key Computation", the most sig-
   nificant 64-bits (8 bytes) of the Key-Generation iteration are used
   for the key, and the remainder are discarded.  Although extremely
   rare, the 64 weak, semi-weak, and possibly weak keys [Schneier95,
   pages 280-282] MUST be discarded.  The Key-Generation-Function is     |
   iterated until a valid key is obtained.

   The least significant bit of each key byte is ignored (or set to par-
   ity when the implementation requires).

   Profile:

      When negotiated with Photuris, the transform differs slightly from
      [RFC-1829].

      The 32-bit Security Parameters Index (SPI) field is followed by a
      32-bit Sequence Number (SN).

      The 64-bit CBC IV is generated from the 32-bit Security Parameters
      Index (SPI) field followed by (concatenated with) the 32-bit
      Sequence Number (SN) field.  Then, the bit-wise complement of the
      32-bit Sequence Number (SN) value is XOR'd with the first 32-bits

   with three keys [KR96].  The selected Exchange-Scheme SHOULD provide  |
   at least 112-bits of cryptographic strength.

   As described in [RFC-zzzz] "Session-Key Computation", the Key-        |
   Generation-Function is iterated (at least) three times to generate
   the three independent keys, in the order used for encryption.  The    |
   most significant 64-bits (8 bytes) of each iteration are used for
   each successive key, and the remainder are discarded.  Each key is
   examined sequentially, in the order used for encryption.  A key that
   is identical to a previous key MUST be discarded.  Although extremely
   rare, the 64 weak, semi-weak, and possibly weak keys [Schneier95,
   pages 280-282] MUST be discarded.  The Key-Generation-Function is     |
   iterated until a valid key is obtained before generating the next
   key.

   In all three keys, the least significant bit of each key byte is
   ignored (or set to parity when the implementation requires).

   Profile:

      When negotiated with Photuris, the transform differs slightly from
      [RFC-1851].

      The 32-bit Security Parameters Index (SPI) field is followed by a
      32-bit Sequence Number (SN).

      The 64-bit CBC IV is generated from the 32-bit Security Parameters
      Index (SPI) field followed by (concatenated with) the 32-bit
      Sequence Number (SN) field.  Then, the bit-wise complement of the
      32-bit Sequence Number (SN) value is XOR'd with the first 32-bits
      (SPI):

         (SPI ^ -SN) || SN

      plaintext length is 41, the padding values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and
      the following PadLength is 5.

      After decryption, if the padding bytes are not the correct values
      for the PadLength, then the payload is discarded, and a "Decryp-
      tion Failed" error is indicated, as described in [RFC-xxxx].

Security Considerations

   The "whitening" of the plaintext before DES encryption is intended to
   obscure the relation of the number of parties and SPIs active between
   two IP nodes.  The combination of a randomized secret mask with the
   CBC IV generates a different initial encrypted block for every SPI
   creation message.

   This obscurement is less effective when the SPI and SPILT are invari-
   ant or are not created for a particular exchange direction.  The num-
   ber of parties could be revealed by the number of exchanges with dif-
   ferences in the initial encrypted blocks.


Acknowledgements

   Phil Karn was principally responsible for the design of party privacy
   protection, and provided much of the design rationale text (now
   removed to a separate document).

   William Simpson designed the packet formats, and additional Exchange- |
   Schemes, editing and formatting.  All such mistakes are his responsi-
   bity.

   Use of encryption for privacy protection is also found in the Sta-
   tion-To-Station authentication protocol [DOW92].

   Bart Preneel and Paul C van Oorschot in [PO96] suggested adding
   padding between the data and trailing key when hashing for authenti-
   cation.

   Niels Provos developed the first implementation with multiple schemes +
   and multiple moduli per scheme (circa July 1997).
