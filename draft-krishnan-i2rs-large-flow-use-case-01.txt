                Large Flow Use Cases for I2RS PBR and QoS

                draft-krishnan-i2rs-large-flow-use-case-01

Abstract

   This draft discusses two use cases to help identify the requirements
   for policy-based routing in I2RS.  Both of the use cases involve
   identification of certain flows and then using I2RS to program
   special handling for those flows.

   The first use case deals with improving bandwidth efficiency.
   Demands on networking bandwidth are growing exponentially due to
   applications such as large file transfers and those with rich media.
   Link Aggregation Group (LAG) and Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) are
   extensively deployed in networks to scale the bandwidth. However,
   the flow-based load balancing techniques used today make inefficient
   use of the bandwidth in the presence of long-lived large flows. We
   discuss how I2RS can be used for achieving better load balancing.

   The second use case is for recognizing and mitigating Layer 3-4
   based DDoS attacks. Behavioral security threats such as Distributed
   Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are an ongoing problem in today's
   networks. DDoS attacks can be Layer 3-4 based or Layer 7 based. We
   discuss how such attacks can be recognized and how I2RS can be used
   for mitigating their effects.

1. Introduction

   This draft describes use cases that address two problems caused by
   large flows. The use case consists of mitigating the problem by
   applying policy-based routing (PBR) on the routing elements using
   its I2RS.  The first large flow problem is that of inefficient
   bandwidth usage due to hash-based load balancing in networks and the
   second is that of DDoS attacks.

1.1. Large Flow Load Balancing

   Networks extensively deploy LAG and ECMP for bandwidth scaling.
   Network traffic can be predominantly categorized into two traffic
   types: long-lived large flows and other flows (which include long-
   lived small flows, short-lived small/large flows) [OPSAWG-large-
   flow]. Stateless hash-based techniques [ITCOM, RFC 2991, RFC 2992,
   and RFC 6790] are often used to distribute flows over the components
   in a LAG/ECMP irrespective of whether the flows are long-lived large
   flows or other types. In a traffic distribution consisting of long-
   lived large flows, the traffic load may not be evenly distributed
   over the components of the LAG or ECMP.

   This draft describes long-lived large flow load balancing techniques
   for achieving the best network bandwidth utilization with LAG/ECMP
   and the corresponding I2RS requirements.  Some of these techniques
   have been described in detail in [OPSAWG-large-flow].  We describe
   methods that can be used locally within a single router, as well as
   methods that can be applied across multiple network elements, where
   the network is under the control of single administrative entity.
   We refer to the former as local load balancing and the latter as
   global load balancing.  A combination of local/global load balancing
   helps in achieving the best network bandwidth utilization and
   latency for a given network topology.

   At a high-level, the technique involves recognizing large flows and
   rebalancing them to achieve optimal load balancing.  Large flows may
   be recognized within a router, or using the aid of an external
   entity such as an IPFIX [RFC 7011] collector or a sFlow [sFlow-v5]
   collector.  Once a large flow has been recognized, it must be
   signaled to an application that makes the rebalancing decision.
   Finally, the rebalancing decision is communicated to the routers to
   program the forwarding plane.  In subsequent sections, we describe
   the requirements with recognition and rebalancing as they pertain to
   I2RS.

1.2. DDoS attack mitigation

   Layer 3-4 based DDoS attacks are an ongoing problem in today's
   networks. Example of Layer 3-4 based DDoS attacks are [FDDOS]:

     .  SYN Flood Attack: Fake TCP connections are setup which result
        in table overflows in stateful devices.

     .  UDP Flood Attack: Servers are flooded with UDP packets that
        result in consumption of bandwidth and CPU.  These can be used
        to target specific services by attacking, e.g., DNS servers and
        VOIP servers.

     .  Christmas Tree Flood Attack: TCP packets from non-existent
        connections with flags other than the SYN flag sent to servers
        result in consumption of more CPU than normal packets because
        of the effort required to discard them.

   Typically, the above attacks are not from a single host or source IP
   address; multiple hosts with different source IP addresses working
   in tandem cause these attacks - hence the term Distributed DoS or
   DDoS.

   The DDoS use case involves recognizing large flows and performing
   various types QoS actions on the recognized flows based on
   configured policies. Large flows may be recognized within a router,
   or using the aid of an external entity such as an IPFIX [RFC 7011]
   collector or a sFlow [sFlow-v5] collector. In subsequent sections,
   we describe the requirements with respect to recognition and QoS
   actions as they pertain to I2RS.

1.3. Large Flow Identification

   From the standpoint of a router, large flows are typically
   identified using one or more fields from the packet header from the
   following list:

     .  Layer 2: source MAC address, destination MAC address, VLAN ID.

     .  IP/TCP/UDP header: IP Protocol, IP source address, IP
        destination address, flow label (IPv6 only), TCP/UDP source
        port, TCP/UDP destination port, TCP Flags.

     .  MPLS Labels.

   For tunneling protocols like GRE, VXLAN, NVGRE, STT, etc., flow
   identification is possible based on inner and/or outer headers. The

   above list is not exhaustive.  This definition of a flow is
   consistent with [RFC 7011].

   In the remainder of this document, consistent with [OPSAWG-large-
   flow], we use the term "large flow" to refer to "long-lived large
   flows," and we use the term "small flow" to refer to any of the
   three other types of flows identified above.

2. Large Flow Recognition, Signaling, and Rebalancing

2.1. Network-based Recognition of Large Flows

   The first step is recognizing large flows. There are two ways for
   recognizing large flows as described in [OPSAWG-large-flow].

   The first method is automatic hardware-based recognition in which
   the large flows are identified in hardware.  Once a large flow is
   recognized, it needs to be communicated to an application that is
   capable of making rebalancing decisions.  This communication is out
   of scope for I2RS and can be handled using protocols such as IPFIX
   [RFC 7011].

   The next method is where sFlow or IPFIX packet sampling [PSAMP] can
   be used to convey packet samples to an external entity such as sFlow
   or IPFIX collector. The external entity recognizes large flows and
   this entity signals the large flows to another application that is
   capable of making rebalancing decisions. Once again, this
   communication is out of scope of the I2RS. An example of software
   which can be used to recognize large flows in real-time is inMon
   sFlow-RT [sFlow-RT]; sFlow-RT is a component of the external sFlow
   collector entity.

2.2. Off-network based notification of Large Flows

   Instead of having the network recognize large flows, the large flow
   can be notified by an application that has awareness of large flows,
   e.g. a backup operation, and may perhaps indicate other parameters
   such as the latency desired.  Such flows would once again need to be
   notified to the application capable of routing or rebalancing
   decisions.  This communication is also outside the scope of I2RS.

2.3. Flow Rebalancing

2.3.1. Local Rebalancing

   In the case of local rebalancing, the utilization of the component
   links that are part of the LAG or ECMP are monitored and the flows
   are redistributed among the member links to ensure optimal load
   balancing across all of the component links.  Typically, this
   involves redirecting large flows to specific ECMP or LAG components,
   and potentially adjusting the weights used to distribute small flows
   across these components, using mechanisms specified in [OPSAWG-
   large-flow].

Internet-Draft          I2RS Large Flow                  September 2013

   This approach works regardless of whether the underlying network is
   IP or MPLS.

   At the RIB level, the nexthop information is typically resolved over
   an IP interface.  However, the IP interface can be realized over a
   L2 LAG. For this use case the nexthop of a PBR route should be
   resolvable to the granularity of a component of a L2 LAG.

   To achieve this, there are two requirements for I2RS:

     .  For redirecting large flows to a specific component, a PBR
        entry is required for the flow with its nexthop that identifies
        the specific LAG or ECMP component.

     .  For adjusting the weights used to distribute traffic across
        components of the LAG or ECMP, a mechanism is needed that
        identifies ECMP entries and is able to associate weights that
        can be programmed for each of the components. To do this in a
        scalable fashion, it would be useful to have the notion of an
        ECMP nexthop that is used by multiple routes.

2.3.2. Global Rebalancing

2.3.2.1. IP Networks

   For IP networks, this involves programming a globally optimal path
   for the large flow.  The globally optimal path is programmed in the
   IP network using hop-by-hop PBR rules.

   For IP networks, this involves creating a globally optimal path
   [HEDERA-dynamic-flow-scheduling] using a network management entity
   which hosts an I2RS client. The globally optimal path is programmed
   in the IP network using hop-by-hop PBR rules. The weights of the
   ECMP table for different nexthops should be adjusted to factor the
   long-lived large flows - this is explained below with an example.

   As an example, consider a 4 way ECMP at node n1 with IP nexthops
   n11, n12, n13, n14 using links l1, l2, l3, l4 each of capacity 10
   Gbps.  Say, a long-lived large flow of average bandwidth 2 Gbps is
   admitted to one of the links l3.  The ECMP nexthop table needs to be
   adjusted to approximately account for the long-lived large flow so
   that the other flows do not overload link l3 which is already used
   by the large flow.  The ECMP nexthop table will be programmed as
   w1*n11, w2*n12, w3*n13, w4*n14 where w1=w2=w4=1 and w3=0.8; this
   needs to be done for all the routes using the same set of nexthops.

Internet-Draft          I2RS Large Flow                  September 2013

   Now, if there are other set of nexthops from node n1 using link l3,
   they should also be adjusted. Say, there is another set of IP ECMP
   nexthops n13, n14, n15, n16 using links l3, l4, l5, l6. The ECMP
   nexthop table will be programmed as w1*n13, w2*n14, w3*n15, w4*n16
   where w2=w3=w4=1 and w1=0.8; this needs to be done for all the
   routes using the same set of nexthops. In practice, there could be
   multiple large flows on a single link and the ECMP nexthop table
   must be adjusted to factor all of these flows.

   As mentioned in Section 2.3.1. , it would be useful to have a way of
   addressing an ECMP group, so that all routes sharing an ECMP group
   are addressed together.

2.3.2.2. MPLS Networks

   There are several ways to address global load rebalancing in MPLS
   networks.  For example:

     .  Have multiple LSPs between ingress and egress routers.  In
        this case, having a PBR entry at the edge LSR that forwards the
        large flow to specific LSP known to have the necessary
        bandwidth is needed.

     .  Program a new LSP for a given large flow.

   Here the requirements for I2RS would be providing the ability to
   program PBR entries at the edge LSR, and the programming new LSPs in
   the network.

3. DDoS Detection and Mitigation

   Layer 3-4 based DDoS attacks can be mapped to large flows in the
   network.  Consider the following example of a TCP SYN attack. A TCP
   SYN packet from a single source IP address can be mapped to a Layer
   4 flow based on the following: IP source/destination addresses,
   TCP/UDP source/destination ports, IP protocol, TCP SYN Flag. For the
   purpose of DDoS it is not useful to observe the above Layer 4 flow
   in the network. Say, we observed a large flow based on IP
   destination addresses, TCP/UDP destination port, IP protocol, and
   TCP SYN flag in the network. In the case of a DDoS attack such a
   flow would cause a significant event in the network in terms of
   exceeding a pre-defined bandwidth threshold over an observation
   interval.

   Once the large flows causing the DDoS attacks are recognized in the
   network, various types of Quality of Service (QoS) actions such as
   rate-limiting, re-marking, or discarding can be performed on the



Krishnan                  Expires April 2014                   [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          I2RS Large Flow                  September 2013

   flows based on configured policies. Besides the QoS actions, we need
   the capability to redirect the large flow to a DDoS scrubber
   appliance for further examination (typically layer 7) of the traffic
   - this can be accomplished through nexthop redirection (the nexthop
   may be directly connected to the router or indirectly through a
   tunnel). The QoS action is independent of the nexthop redirection
   action. It should be possible to program either of these actions
   independently of the other. This would help in preventing resource
   exhaustion (CPU, memory etc.) on devices such as servers and unfair
   access to network resources in a multitenant network.

4. Summary

   We have described the problems of large flow load balancing and DDoS
   mitigation using I2RS.  In both cases, the problem translates to
   that of detection large flows that meet certain criteria.  The
   detection can be done without I2RS using tools such as IPFIX and
   sFlow.

   Once a large flow has been detected, I2RS must be used to modify the
   forwarding tables in the router.

     .  In the case of large flow load balancing, this may involve
        redirecting the large flow to a particular member with the LAG
        or ECMP group and readjusting the weights of the other members
        to account for the large flow.

     .  In the case of DDoS mitigation, the action involves rate
        limiting, remarking or potentially discarding the large flow in
        question.

5. Operational Considerations

   Operational considerations would be similar to those specified in
   [OPSAWG-large-flow].

6. IANA Considerations

   None.

7. Security Considerations

   This draft specifies a use case for I2RS and does not introduce any
   new security requirements beyond those already under consideration
   for I2RS.
