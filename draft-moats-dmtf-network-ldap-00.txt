Abstract

   This draft presents a LDAP schema for the DMTF CIM Network model
   version 2.2 [4].

1. Introduction

   This draft presents a LDAPv3 [1,2] schema for the DMTF CIM Network
   model.  Associations are mapped using a combination of auxiliary
   classes and DIT structure rules.  Where auxiliary classes are used,
   name form and DIT content rules are specified.

2. Class Definitions

   For efficiency in the LDAP representation, associations are specified
   as a combination of auxiliary classes and DIT structure rules.
   Attribute definitions for each class are presented with the object

   class.  Other definitions are also provided when necessary.

   This approach minimizes the number of DN pointers stored in the
   schema, but some pointer dereferencing is necessary.  While not
   explicitly stated in the definitions below, we assume that all
   attributes with DN support the matching rule defined in [3].
   Attribute names for DN pointers also follow the convention that a
   single pointer's name ends in "Ref", while an array of pointers' name
   ends in "Refs".

   Note: all OIDs are place holders, and OIDs in definitions have been
   replaced by names for clarity.

   There are some differences between the classes and associations
   specified in the CIM model and the schema here.  First, because the
   core model requires services to be contained by systems the
   NetworkServicesInAdminDomain association doesn't add any new
   information.  Second, there are a couple of classes that don't have
   structural rules specified for them as they don't specify any new
   RDNs.  There are a couple of namespace collisions between this model
   and and other models, a couple of attributes in this model have been
   renamed.  Finaly, the classes TransparentBridgingStatistics,
   SpanningTreeStatistics, SwitchPortStatistics,
   SwitchPortTransparentBridingStatistics,
   SwitchPortSpanningTreeStatistics, SwitchPortSourceRoutingStatisitcs,
   BGPStatistics, and BGPServiceStatistics aren't included as they
   contain counter information that is considered too dynamic for
   directory storage.

2.1 dmtfAdminDomain

   This is a special grouping of dmtfManagedSystemElement objects that
   are all administered by the same user or group of users. It serves as
   an aggregation point to associate one or more of the following
   elements: network devices, such as routers and switches, servers, and
   other resources that can be accessed by end systems. This grouping of
   devices plays an essential role in ensuring that the same
   administrative POLICY is applied to all the devices in the grouping.

2.2 dmtfNetworkService

   This abstract base class is derived from the dmtfService class. It
   serves as the root of the network service hierarchy. Network services
   represent generic functions that are available from the network that
   configure and/or change the traffic being sent. For example, FTP is
   not a network service, as it simply passes data unchanged from source
   to destination. On the other hand, services that provide quality of
   service (e.g., DiffServ) and security (e.g., IPSec) do affect the
   traffic stream. Quality of service, IPSec, and other services are
   subclasses of this class. This class hierarchy enables developers to
   match services to users, groups, and other objects in the network.

2.3 dmtfForwardingService

   This class represents the forwarding of network traffic by receiving
   data from one or more protocol endpoints and sending that data via
   other protocol endpoints. This class is different from the
   dmtfRouteCalculationService class in that it represents a way to
   forward traffic independent of calculating routing information (e.g.,
   using static routing). Generally, the endpoints a forwarding service
   routes data among are at the same protocol layer and are usually of
   similar types or of the same type. Examples of this service include
   routing, bridging, and repeating services.

2.4 dmtfAutonomousSystem

   This class provides a structured view of routing by segregating the
   system that is using routing (e.g., the Internet, or an extranet)
   into a set of separately administered domains that each have their
   own independent routing policies. These domains are called autonomous
   systems.  The classic definition of an AS, from RFC1771, is

       ...a set of routers under a single technical administration,
      using an interior gateway protocol and common metrics to route
      packets within the AS, and using an exterior gateway protocol to
      route packets to other ASs

   The RFC continues

      Since this classic definition was developed, it has become common

      for a single AS to use several interior gateway protocols and
      sometimes several sets of metrics within an AS. The use of the
      term Autonomous System here stresses that, even when multiple IGPs
      and metrics are used, the administration of an AS appears to other
      ASs to have a single coherent interior routing plan and presents a
      consistent picture of what destinations are reachable through it.

              neighbors to external BGP destinations unless those
              destinations are also known via some internal gateway
              protocol. Otherwise, a BGP router may receive traffic that
              cannot yet be routed. However, since this is a costly

2.25 dmtfBGPCluster

   BGP speakers in an AS are required to be fully meshed. This can lead
   to a huge number of TCP connections per router. One way to reduce the
   peering requirements is to use a route reflector. This is based on
   specifying one or more routers to act as focal points for IBGP
   sessions. The route reflector as a whole is called a cluster. It is
   logically divided into three types of routers: reflectors, clients of
   the route reflector(s), and non-clients of the route reflector. An AS
   can have more than one route reflector. There can be more than one
   route reflector in a cluster, and there can be more than one cluster
   in an AS.

   confederation effectively partitions one AS into a group of 'sub-
   ASs'. This enables all the benefits of IBGP to be applied inside the
   confederation, while enabling EBGP to be run between each
   confederation. This enables certain BGP attribute values to be
   preserved between confederations. However, to the outside world, the
   AS with its confederations appear to be a single AS.

2.42 dmtfRoutingPolicy

   This class implements routing policies. It aggregates a set of
   FilterLists, along with other appropriate constructs, into a unit. A
   most important use of this class is to change the routing policy by
   changing values of various BGP attributes in a consistent manner.
   Since a RoutingPolicy is weak to the network device (e.g., the
   ComputerSystem) that contains it, DIT structural rules are also
   specified.

2.78 dmtfVLAN

   This class_VLAN represents a VLAN within a switch.  In a particular
   switch, there should be an instance of this object for every VLAN
   available in the switch. For example, in a switchwith port-based
   VLANs, if there are 16 VLANs to which ports canbe assigned (VLAN 1
   through VLAN 16), there should be aninstance of CIM_VLAN for each of
   VLAN 1 through VLAN 16.

   This class inherits Name from ServiceAccessPoint. Use this for the
   textual name of the VLAN, if there is one. Otherwise, synthesize a
   textual name, e.g., VLAN 0003. (Consider leading zero fill, as shown,
   to ensure that if the textual VLAN names are extracted and presented
   by management applictions, the VLAN names will sort in the expected
   order.

   It is intended that dmtfVLAN be subclassed only if necessary to add

   information is propagated among switches, e.g., GVRP in 802.1Q
   switches and VTP in Cisco Catalyst switches. VLANService also
   represents the function performed by the switch as a participant in
   such a protocol.  VLANService must be subclassed so that instances
   can be distinguished by their class. If there is a name assigned to a
   set of VLAN-aware switches, e.g., the VTP domain name in Cisco
   Catalyst switches, use the Name attribute inherited from dmtfService
   to store the name. A VLANService should be instantiated in a VLAN-
