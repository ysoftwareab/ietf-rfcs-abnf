<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document provides a framework and methodology for performing
   performance test and benchmarking of wireless LAN (WLAN) switches and
   controllers, including systems comprising groups of controllers and
   WTPs. This document defines and discusses a number of tests and
   associated test conditions that may be used to characterize the
   performance of such systems, and also supplies the methods used to
   calculate the expected results of these tests.  Specific formats for
   reporting the results of the tests are also provided, where
   applicable. The tests described in this document extend the
   methodology defined for benchmarking network interconnect devices in
   RFC 2544, and LAN switches in RFC 2889, to WLAN switch controller
   systems. The methodology herein is to be used together with the
   companion terminology document.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Wireless LANs (WLANs) are deployed on a large scale in traditional
   enterprises, in commercial service offerings such as coffee shops,
   and in vertical applications such as inventory management.  Large
   deployments of WLANs, however, introduce several issues: an
   increased administrative burden due to the use of IP-addressable
   Wireless Termination Points (WTPs - i.e., Access Points); the need to
   ensure consistency of configuration across all WTPs; the need to
   deal with the dynamic nature of the WLAN medium, and to combat
   interference; and the increased need for securing the network
   against unauthorized intrusion or access.
</p>
<p>To address the above problems, vendors offer solutions that combine
   aspects of LAN switching, centralized control, and distributed
   wireless access in an architecture comprising a set of relatively
   simple Wireless termination points (WTPs) coupled to one or more
   Access controllers (ACs). The use of centralized control and
   monitoring simplifies many of the management and security issues
   noted above, as the WTPs can be configured and controlled as a group
   by the ACs, security policies can be administered on a WLAN-wide
   basis, and the RF domain can be monitored and controlled from a
   central location.
</p>
<p>Each vendor offering such a system needs a protocol between ACs and
   WTPs to support both centralized management and data transport
   functions. The general practice has been for vendors to use a
   proprietary protocol; however, the CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning
   of Wireless Access Points) protocol is being standardized by
   the IETF to provide a multi-vendor interoperable interface between
   WTPs and ACs. The CAPWAP protocol also defines a standardized WLAN
   architecture and mandatory functions (such as discovery) to enable a
   common functional model to be adopted across the vendor base.
</p>
<p>The ACs may perform both control plane and data plane functions
   within a WLAN. It is therefore of significant interest to benchmark
   their performance, as they have a material impact on the performance
   and perceived end-user experience of WLANs built around them. ACs
   may be benchmarked either as stand-alone entities, or in conjunction
   with the WTPs to which they connect. When ACs are benchmarked in
   conjunction with WTPs, the CAPWAP architectural model is used as a
   reference.
</p>
<p>This document defines and describes a test methodology that may be
   used by vendors and users of IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN (WLAN) <a class='info' href='#802.11'>[802.11]<span> (</span><span class='info'>IEEE, &ldquo;ANSI/IEEE Std 802.11 &quot;Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access                 Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications,&quot; ISO/IEC                 8802-11:1999(E), ISBN 0-7381-1658-0,&rdquo; 1999.</span><span>)</span></a>

   802.11 WLAN devices.
</p>
<p>Note that this document does not specify RF-related tests, or
   performance benchmarks that pertain to the IEEE 802.11 link layer.
   Instead, this document focuses on datapath and control path related
   measurements performed above the link layer on ACs, or combinations
   of ACs and WTPs. For RF-related tests, link layer metrics and tests
   on individual WTPs, the reader is referred to the IEEE 802.11.2
   draft Recommended Practice on Wireless Performance <a class='info' href='#802.11.2'>[802.11.2]<span> (</span><span class='info'>IEEE, &ldquo;IEEE P802.11.2, &quot;Draft Recommended Practice for the Evaluation of                 802.11 Wireless Performance&quot;,&rdquo; 2007.</span><span>)</span></a>,

<p>The tester MUST transmit conformant traffic to the DUT or SUT during
   the tests described herein, and MUST follow the rules of the relevant
   protocol with respect to media access and frame exchanges. It MAY be
   configured to transmit non-conformant traffic for special purposes
   (e.g., for debug), but this is outside the scope of this document.
   The tester MUST support some means of distinguishing test traffic
   (either injected into or emitted by the DUT or SUT) from normal data,
   control and management frames that are generated by the DUT or SUT itself.
   The tester SHOULD further support means of unambiguously determining
   frame loss and frame duplication (e.g., by the use of sequence
   numbers), as well as time-stamping transmitted and received frames.
</p>
<p>No constraints are placed by this document on the specific
   implementation of the tester or test system, provided that it is
   capable of measuring DUT or SUT responses to the required degree of
   accuracy, establishing the required test conditions at the physical
   interfaces of the DUT or SUT, and generating test traffic with the
   relevant parameters. These parameters include frame sizes, offered
   load, burst sizes and inter-burst gap, signal output level,
   RTS/CTS setting, and fragmentation setting.

Test setups</h3>

<p>The general test setup comprises a DUT or SUT and a tester, as shown
   in the figure below. The tester has at least one wired (Ethernet)
   interface to the DUT or SUT; the other interface(s) may be either
   wired or wireless (i.e., Ethernet or 802.11). In most cases, the
   DUT or SUT has multiple interfaces that must be driven, and so the
   tester likewise will have multiple wired and/or wireless interfaces.

<p>The DUT or SUT may be comprised of two different arrangements,
   leading to two variations on the above general test setup. One
   arrangement has only one or more ACs, but no WTPs; in this case, the
   tester must emulate the WTPs as well as the endstations behind them,
   and present the aggregate to the AC(s). In the second arrangement,
   the device is actually a SUT comprising both WTPs and ACs
   (treated as a single system); in this case, the tester only emulates
   the endstations and presents them to the WTPs.
</p>
<p>The following figure shows the first setup (DUT), with a single
   tester that interfaces to a collection of one or more ACs. Note that
   the ACs may be physically distinct (i.e., implemented in separate
   chassis) or logically distinct (i.e., implemented in a single
   chassis), but in either case is expected to form a logical whole
   for the purposes of management, addressing, endstation association,
   and traffic handling.

WTP setup</h3>

<p>This section is applicable only if the SUT includes WTPs
   (i.e., APs).
</p>
<p>The WTPs in the SUT MUST be configured to use only the subset of
   wireless channels available to a normal user at the location where
   the system is intended to be used.  For example, if the test is run
   in the U.S., then standard U.S. wireless channels are used. The
   channels used MUST be reported with the test results.
</p>
<p>The 802.11 protocol supports the use of a Request To Send (RTS) /
   Clear To Send (CTS) handshake prior to data transfer, as a means for
   interfaces to seize and reserve the medium before actually
   transferring data. For SUTs or WTPs with adjustable RTS thresholds,
   tests MAY be run at different RTS thresholds, although a full suite
   of tests MUST be run at the highest RTS threshold supported by the
   SUT. The RTS threshold used MUST be reported with the
   test results.
</p>
<p>The 802.11 protocol supports fragmentation and reassembly at the link
   layer, in order to decrease retransmission overhead under high error
   rates that may prevail in a radio frequency (RF) environment. For
   SUTs or WTPs with adjustable fragmentation thresholds, tests MAY be
   run at different fragmentation thresholds, although a full suite of
   tests MUST be run at the highest fragmentation threshold supported
   by the SUT. The fragmentation threshold used MUST be reported with
   the test results.
</p>
<p>Note that RTS/CTS and fragmentation are not used when transferring
   multicast frames; they apply only to unicast frames.

Service priority</h3>

<p>WLAN ACs frequently include the capability to classify traffic flows
   and assign them to different service levels or service priorities.
   For example, a voice flow may be classified as real-time traffic and
   assigned a high level of service (e.g., with assured limits on
   delay and loss), while an HTTP stream may be assigned a lower
   service priority. Classification may also be made on the basis of
   DiffServ code points (DSCP) or even 802.1D user priority values.
</p>
<p>For DUTs or SUTs supporting multiple service priorities (QoS levels),
   tests MAY be run at different service priorities, although a full
   suite of tests SHOULD be run at least one service priority. For such
   DUTs or SUTs, the service priority used in each test MUST be
   reported with the test results.
</p>
<p>Throughput and latency tests on WTPs involving traffic
   traversing wired interfaces can be affected by QoS settings on these
   wired interfaces.  In such situations, the QoS settings assigned to
   the wired interfaces of WTPs MUST be reported with the test

Test environment</h3>

<p>This section is only applicable to SUTs containing WTPs.
</p>
<p>Wireless LAN test environments may be divided into two general
   categories: shielded environments and open-air (unshielded)
   environments.
</p>
<p>Shielded environments use cabling and/or RF shielding techniques to
   significantly attenuate external signals and noise.
   The WTP(s) that are part of
   the SUT are enclosed within an RF-tight chamber and cabled to the
   tester as well as the AC or ACs. The tester is also placed in an
   RF-tight chamber, or has an RF-tight enclosure. Such environments
   are well known to provide the highest level of repeatability and
   reproducibility, with the minimum amount of complicated RF
   management and setup issues.
   Different types of enclosures (shielded enclosures, screened
   rooms, and anechoic chambers) may be employed to provide RF
   shielding.
</p>
<p>Open-air environments mimic the actual use model of a WLAN DUT or
   SUT. In this case, the WTP(s) that are part of the SUT are placed
   at a specific location within some moderately controlled (or at
   least well characterized) indoor or outdoor environment, and
   antennas are used for coupling between equipment.
</p>
<p>To assure the maximum level of repeatability and reproducibility
   without complicated environment setup and characterization needs,
   the tests described in this document MUST be carried out in a
   fully shielded (conducted) test environment.
   The use of a fully shielded environment eliminates the possibility
   of interference from surrounding networks or devices emitting RF
   energy.
   The enclosures and cabling used MUST provide a minimum of 80 dB
   of RF isolation.
   Provided that the power levels are set as described below, the
   test results are materially independent of the exact type of
   shielded test environment and the properties of the enclosures
   used.

<a name="rfc.section.3.3.3.2"></a><h3>3.3.3.2.&nbsp;
Power levels</h3>

<p>This section is only applicable to SUTs containing WTPs.
</p>
<p>Power levels are generally set by measuring and controlling the
   Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) at the RF receivers
   within the setup.
   The RSSI measured at the tester's receiver SHOULD be in the range
   of -25 dBm to -35 dBm.
   Similarly, the RSSI measured at each WTP's receiver SHOULD be in
   the range of -25 dBm to -35 dBm.
   Passive attenuators SHOULD be used to control and set the RSSI
   within these limits.
   The RSSI MUST be measured and reported with the test results.
   The actual choice of WTP power level should not materially affect
   the results of the tests described herein, provided that the RSSI
   values fall within these limits.
</p>
<p>If these power level settings are not used, then
   the tester MUST ensure that the RF power levels (at the receivers
   of the WTP(s) and tester) are at least 20 dB above the minimum
   and 10 dB below the maximum levels specified for a 10% Frame Error
   Ratio (FER).
   Further, the tester MUST ensure that the absolute signal level
   transmitted to the DUT or SUT is held constant to within +/- 3 dB
   over the duration of the trial.

<a name="rfc.section.3.3.3.3"></a><h3>3.3.3.3.&nbsp;
Data plane test frame sizes</h3>

<p>All of the data plane tests SHOULD be performed using several fixed
   sizes of test data frames. Regardless of the interface type, frame
   sizes MUST be calculated from the first byte of the MAC header to
   the last byte of the FCS. The test results MUST list the frame sizes
   used for test data frames.
</p>
<p>MAC frame sizes change drastically when traffic moves from the
   802.11 (WLAN) side to the 802.3 (Ethernet) side, and vice versa.
   Further, the 802.11 MAC protocol specifies various mode-specific
   encapsulations; for instance, the four currently defined encryption
   modes (none, WEP, TKIP and AES-CCMP) result in four different 802.11
   MAC frame sizes for the same size Ethernet frame, and enabling QoS on
   the WLAN links adds another 2 bytes to the WLAN MAC header. Use of
   CAPWAP or similar protocols on the wireless-facing side of an AC
   adds an encapsulation header to the 802.11 MAC frame. This makes
   frame size calculations and reporting of results quite
   challenging.
</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, therefore, frame sizes reported with the test
   results MUST be referenced to the Ethernet side of the DUT or SUT.
   Further, the DUT or SUT configuration parameters such as encryption
   mode and QoS, necessary to enable the equivalent WLAN-side frame size
   to be calculated from the Ethernet side frame size, MUST be reported
   as well.
</p>
<p>The change in frame size also leads to confusion when interpreting
   results expressed in bits/second or megabits/second. Test results
   SHOULD therefore be expressed, where applicable, in frames/second of
   a particular size on the Ethernet.  The equivalent bits/second or
   megabits/second values MAY be provided as well, as long as the test
   reports include at least the values for the Ethernet interface and
   clearly identify the interface(s) to which these values apply.
</p>
<p>Note that all test data frames crossing the WLAN/Ethernet boundary
   contain IP packets; in fact, due to the change in MAC encapsulation
   when traversing this boundary, only the IP information will be
   transported intact. Therefore, test results MAY also be expressed
   in terms of IP packets/second of a particular size. As far as the
   test data traffic is concerned, the number of IP packets per second
   on any path traversing the DUT or SUT is exactly equal to the number
   of link layer frames/second measured at each of the interfaces
   traversed by that path.
</p>
<p>Referenced to the Ethernet side, the MAC frame sizes that MUST be
   used during data plane tests are:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>88, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1280, 1518
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that the smallest frame size is 88 bytes, instead of the 64
   bytes more commonly encountered in standard wired LAN benchmarks.
   A larger frame size is selected in order to provide enough room in
   the payload for an internetwork layer header, a transport layer
   header, and a tag or signature field that SHOULD be inserted by the
   test equipment to track the data traffic packets. An 88 byte MAC
   frame size allows at least 26 bytes of payload for a signature field.
</p>
<p>If the test equipment is capable of properly marking and tracking
   64-byte Ethernet frames (with or without 802.1Q VLAN tags present),
   then 64-byte MAC frames MUST be used during tests, in addition to the
   frame sizes listed above.
</p>
<p>If the wired interfaces of the DUT or SUT can support jumbo frames
   (i.e., Ethernet frame sizes larger than 1518 bytes), then the
   following MAC frame sizes MAY additionally be used:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>2030, 2322
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The maximum Ethernet MAC frame size of 2322 bytes ensures that the
   re-encapsulated payload on the WLAN side does not exceed the maximum
   IEEE 802.11 MAC payload size of 2304 bytes.
</p>
<p>These frame sizes apply to Ethernet MAC frames irrespective of
   whether they contain VLAN tags or not. If 802.1Q VLAN tagging is
   used on the Ethernet side, then this MUST be reported with the test
   results, as the consequence is to make the 802.11-side MAC frames
   4 bytes smaller.

Control plane test frame sizes</h3>

<p>The control plane tests described in this document also involve test
   traffic data flows generated by the tester as part of the measurement
   process. Unless otherwise specified, a frame size of 256 bytes
   (referenced to the Ethernet side) MUST be used for these test data
   flows. (This value is arbitrarily selected, but specified to ensure
   reproducibility of tests.) If 802.1Q VLAN tagging is used, this will

   plane tests with other MAC frame sizes, though this MAY be done if
   desired.

   null 802.11 frames) SHOULD follow the recommendations in Appendix C
   of RFC 2544 <a class='info' href='#RFC2544'>[RFC2544]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S. and J. McQuaid, &ldquo;Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>.

   the DUT or SUT, and Type-encoded encapsulation as per IEEE 802.3
   <a class='info' href='#802.3'>[802.3]<span> (</span><span class='info'>IEEE, &ldquo;ANSI/IEEE Std 802.3, &quot;Part 3: Carrier sense multiple access                 with collision detection (CSMA/CD) access method and physical                 layer specifications,&quot; ISBN 0-7381-4740-0,&rdquo; 2005.</span><span>)</span></a> MUST be used on the Ethernet side.
</p>
<p>In all cases, the test frame format MUST contain some means (such
   as a unique signature field, as described in Section 4 of RFC 2544
   <a class='info' href='#RFC2544'>[RFC2544]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S. and J. McQuaid, &ldquo;Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>) that will enable the tester
   to filter out frames that are
   not part of the offered load, or are duplicated by the DUT. In tests
   on DUTs/SUTs involving multiple virtual or physical test
   endstations, the test frame format MAY also support means for
   distinguishing between frames originating from different
   endstations.
</p>
<p>The provisions for verifying received frames in Section 10 of RFC
   2544 <a class='info' href='#RFC2544'>[RFC2544]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S. and J. McQuaid, &ldquo;Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a> SHOULD be followed as well.
   This is particularly
   significant for test setups where the tester connects to an 802.11
   wireless interface, as 802.11 implements retransmission at the link
   layer. The verification of received frames SHOULD be independent of
   the facilities provided by the MAC, IP and TCP/UDP layers. In the
   case of data plane tests, the tester MAY support an independent
   means of verifying the absence of end-to-end payload corruption,
   such as a checksum or CRC calculated over the payload portion of
   the data frames.

Addressing</h3>

<p>To ensure independence of test results relative to address patterns,
   the test setup SHOULD follow the recommendations in RFC 4814
   <a class='info' href='#RFC4814'>[RFC4814]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Newman, D. and T. Player, &ldquo;Hash and Stuffing: Overlooked Factors in Network Device Benchmarking,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>, to create pseudorandom MAC and IP
   address patterns.
   However, as noted in Section 4.2.1 of RFC 4814, ACs, particularly
   those implementing ARP proxies and spoofing protection, can reject
   endstations that change their MAC and/or IP address mappings from
   trial to trial. To avoid this, the address mappings used MUST NOT
   change between trials or between consecutive tests that are
   performed without sufficient time for the context entries in the
   AC to age out.
</p>
<p>DHCP MAY be used to provide IP addresses to endstations in data
   plane tests. If this is done, then the test results MUST note that
   DHCP was being used. DHCP MAY NOT be used in control plane tests
   unless specifically required as one of the test conditions.  Note
   that many ACs require DHCP to be used to provide IP addresses to
   WTPs; in this situation, a DHCP server is needed for this purpose.
   If all of the WTPs (and/or all of the endstations) cannot be located
   within one subnet, then DHCP helper addresses MUST be configured to
   allow the use of a single DHCP server.
</p>
<p>In multicast tests, multicast IP addresses MUST be drawn from the
   Class D address pool and multicast MAC addresses MUST correspond
   to the Class D IP addresses, as described in RFC 3918
   <a class='info' href='#RFC3918'>[RFC3918]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stopp, D. and B. Hickman, &ldquo;Methodology for IP Multicast Benchmarking,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> and

Traffic flows and topologies</h3>

<p>Traffic flows used in the data and control plane tests transit the
   AC within the DUT or SUT; that is, they are either from the Ethernet
   side to the wireless side, from the wireless side to the Ethernet
   side, or in both directions. Traffic flows that are purely Ethernet
   or purely wireless-side are outside the scope of this document. Note
   that wireless-to-wireless test metrics and procedures are already
   covered in IEEE 802.11.2.
</p>
<p>Fully-meshed traffic topologies, per section 3.3.3 of RFC 2285
   <a class='info' href='#RFC2285'>[RFC2285]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mandeville, R., &ldquo;Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices,&rdquo; February&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> are not applicable to wireless
   testing; virtually no
   unicast traffic is sent directly between wireless devices. Instead,
   one-to-many or many-to-one topologies (per section 3.3.2 of RFC 2285
   <a class='info' href='#RFC2285'>[RFC2285]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mandeville, R., &ldquo;Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices,&rdquo; February&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a>) are used.
   In addition, the partially-meshed
   one-to-many/many-to-one topology is commonly used for forwarding,
   latency, and QoS tests.
</p>
<p>In the case of multicast traffic flows, the most common case is a
   traffic flow direction from Ethernet to wireless (i.e., downstream
   relative to the endstations) using a one-to-many topology.  New
   applications such as push-to-talk for VoIP over WLAN handsets also
   require many-to-many traffic flow topologies; however, the tests
   described in this document do not yet cover such situations.

Half-duplex effects</h3>

<p>WLAN WTPs and endstations perform medium access in half-duplex
   mode, which can cause the actual offered load to be less than the
   intended load imposed by the tester. The tester MUST therefore
   adjust the inter-frame spacing according to the target intended load
   (i.e., to achieve the desired rate of frame transmission), and then
   MUST measure and report the actual offered load at the end of the
   trial.
</p>
<p>Appendix A of this document provides some notes about generating the
   intended load for tests described herein.  Either the frame-based or
   the time-based method described in Appendix B of RFC 2889
   <a class='info' href='#RFC2889'>[RFC2889]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mandeville, R. and J. Perser, &ldquo;Benchmarking Methodology for LAN Switching Devices,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>
   MAY be used, but, in either case, the method used MUST be reported
   with the results. Most of the tests in this document use a constant
   (non-bursty) load, and the Iload calculations in Section A.2 apply.
   Burst loads use the calculations in Section A.3.
</p>
<p>The tester SHOULD note attempts by the DUT or SUT to violate the
   timing requirements of the 802.11 protocol by not conforming to the
   backoff rules, or by reducing its inter-frame spacing to less than
   the legal minimum.

Wireless physical layer (PHY) settings</h3>

<p>This section is only applicable to SUTs containing WTPs.
</p>
<p>The physical layer of the 802.11 WLAN protocol supports data transfer
   (PHY data rate) at a number of different bit rates.
   For instance, the 2.4 GHz OFDM PHY layer (formerly referred to as
   802.11g) uses bit rates of 1, 2, 5.5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48
   and 54 Mb/s. These data rates are achieved with
   different modulation formats, generally resulting in different
   frame error ratios and/or signal-to-noise ratios at the receiver.
   Tests performed at one data rate may not correlate with tests
   performed at another rate. The test results MUST therefore record
   the data rate used by both the DUT or SUT and the tester.  At least
   one trial SHOULD be performed at the highest PHY data rate supported
   by the DUT or SUT.
</p>
<p>Rate adaptation is supported by 802.11 devices in order to transfer
   unicast data under changing signal conditions.
   (Multicast frames are transmitted by each
   WTP at a fixed default rate, which is usually the highest basic rate
   configured.)
   Devices can
   automatically fall back to lower PHY data rates to cope with
   decreasing signal-to-noise ratios.
   This can make test results
   impossible to reproduce or interpret in the case of measurements
   needing constant PHY data rates.  A given trial MUST maintain a
   constant PHY data rate for all test data packets presented on the
   wireless side of the DUT or SUT, unless otherwise specified by the
   test.
</p>
<p>The 802.11 WLAN protocol uses retransmissions to compensate for the
   relatively high frame error ratio on the wireless medium. This
   effectively trades goodput for reliable data transfer. Frame errors
   rise sharply as the wireless signal-to-noise ratio degrades. Hence
   the performance of the 802.11 wireless link is materially affected
   by the signal levels at the receivers of both the DUT or SUT and the
   tester. The test results therefore MUST report the average RSSI
   (Received Signal Strength Indication) measured at the wireless
   interfaces of the tester during the test.

<a name="rfc.section.3.3.3.10"></a><h3>3.3.3.10.&nbsp;
Security settings</h3>

<p>WLAN DUTs/SUTs typically implement a wide variety of authentication
   and encryption protocols, and it is of interest to characterize their
   performance when using these protocols. Examples of authentication
   protocols include preshared key (PSK), EAP-TLS, PEAP, LEAP, EAP-MD5,
   EAP-MSCHAP and EAP-TTLS. Examples of encryption protocols include
   WEP-40, WEP-128, TKIP and AES-CCMP.
</p>
<p>Transfer of data between stations in 802.11 is permitted to begin
   only after a successful connection setup, including capabilities
   negotiation, user authentication, and (usually) installation of
   encryption keys. Also, as per the IEEE 802.11 standard, data must not
   be transmitted after a connection has been terminated.
</p>
<p>For data plane tests, the tester MUST authenticate the virtual or
   physical endstations used for each test with the DUT or SUT prior to
   the start of each trial, using the appropriate security method. It
   SHOULD perform a endstation connection handshake with the DUT or SUT
   at the start of each trial, and a deauthentication handshake at the
   conclusion. However, it MAY elect to remain connected with the DUT
   across multiple trials, in which case the deauthentication handshake
   can be performed at the end of the test.
</p>
<p>Disassociation of a virtual or physical endstation by the DUT or SUT
   during the test data transfer portion of a trial MUST be reported
   and SHOULD cause the trial to be terminated.  Further, the tester
   MUST NOT count as valid any unicast data frame from the DUT or SUT
   that arrives for a virtual or physical endstation when the latter is
   not completely authenticated.
</p>
<p>For a number of control plane tests, the connection handshake forms
   an integral part of the test procedure, and the requirements for
   authentication and connection setup are described in the specific
   tests.
</p>
<p>To provide a baseline, a full suite of tests SHOULD be run with no
   encryption and no authentication enabled.

Multiple endstations</h3>

<p>To characterize the context-handling capabilities of the DUT or SUT
   datapaths, measurements of frame loss, throughput, forwarding rate,
   latency and burst capacity SHOULD be performed with multiple
   endstations on either the wireless side, the wired side, or both. If
   used, the multiple endstations MUST be concurrently transmitting
   traffic.
</p>
<p>This simulates the situation in an actual network, where multiple
   endstations and servers are connected to a single DUT or SUT and
   contribute to the total offered load. Each endstation is represented
   by a different MAC/IP address combination. The MAC and IP addresses
   of the different endstations SHOULD be chosen according to the
   preceding section on addressing.
</p>
<p>The number of endstations used in the test MUST be reported.  For
   throughput, frame loss, forwarding rate and burst capacity tests, the
   aggregate results for all of the endstations combined MUST be
   reported. For latency tests, the worst-case latency and smoothed
   interarrival jitter among all of the endstations MUST be reported.
</p>
<p>To provide a baseline, a full suite of tests SHOULD be run with a
   single endstation on the wireless side and a single endstation on the
   Ethernet side.

Multiple virtual WLANs</h3>

<p>Virtually all enterprise WLAN infrastructure equipment allows the
   configuration of multiple overlay (or "virtual") WLANs on the
   wireless topology.  These virtual WLANs are distinguished by
   different SSIDs being supported on each WTP and AC; on any given
   WTP, each SSID corresponds to a separate BSSID and has a separate
   beacon stream associated with it. The virtual WLANs serve the same
   purpose as VLANs in Ethernet networks, namely, segregation, security
   and management. Each virtual WLAN usually (but not necessarily)
   maps to a separate VLAN or subnet on the Ethernet side of the
   DUT or SUT.
</p>
<p>The different virtual WLANs may have different security, QoS,
   endstation capacity, radio characteristics, bandwidth limits, and
   other parameters. The virtual WLAN configuration of the DUT or SUT
   therefore has a material impact on the performance results obtained.
</p>
<p>In all cases, the baseline measurement MUST be made with a single
   virtual WLAN (i.e., a single SSID) configured on the DUT or SUT. Once
   the baseline has been measured, additional measurements MAY be
   carried out with more than one virtual WLAN being configured. The
   virtual WLAN setup (including security and QoS parameters) MUST be
   detailed in the test results.

<a name="rfc.section.3.3.3.13"></a><h3>3.3.3.13.&nbsp;
Mobility</h3>

<p>The common case of mobility (roaming) is one or more endstations
   that move between WTPs within the same IP subnet, thus keeping the
   roaming process transparent to the IP protocol layer and above.
   However, many DUTs/SUTs allow WLAN endstations to roam between WTPs
   that are physically located on different subnets, without requiring
   the roaming endstation to obtain a new IP address via DHCP or other
   means. This 'inter-subnet roaming' is actually carried out by a
   proxying process; the WTP to which the endstation roams acts as a
   'remote agent' for the WTP from which the endstation has roamed,
   with tunnels being used to transport the endstation's data packets
   back to the subnet to which it belongs.
</p>
<p>Tests of mobility SHOULD therefore include both inter-subnet roaming
   as well as intra-subnet roaming. The two cases MUST be tested
   separately, and the results reported separately.
</p>
<p>In addition, roaming may also be divided into intra-AC and inter-AC
   roaming scenarios (as described in the accompanying terminology
   document), provided that the DUT or SUT contains multiple ACs.
   There are hence four possible roaming test scenarios:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>intra-subnet, intra-AC
</li>
<li>intra-subnet, inter-AC
</li>
<li>inter-subnet, intra-AC
</li>
<li>inter-subnet, inter-AC
</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these four scenarios, the first (intra-subnet, intra-AC) MUST
   be tested as the baseline case. The other three scenarios SHOULD
   also be tested if the DUT or SUT supports the relevant functions.
   The results for each scenario MUST be reported separately.
</p>
<p>Data plane tests MUST NOT involve roaming behavior (i.e., endstations
   moving between WTPs) because roaming causes irreproducible traffic
   delays and interruptions. Roaming behavior MUST occur only in the
   tests specifically indicated as roaming tests.
</p>
<p>When conducting roaming tests, the tester MUST distinguish between
   the tester-imposed delay and the DUT or SUT imposed delay.  For
   example, the time delay between the receipt of a connection handshake
   frame by the tester during the reassociation process, and the
   transmission of the corresponding response frame, is tester-imposed
   delay.  The two kinds of delays MUST be reported separately, and the
   tester-imposed delay SHOULD be subtracted from the overall roaming
   delay when reporting the overall roaming delay of the DUT or SUT.
</p>
<p>The tester MUST transmit learning frames after each roam event by
   an endstation. Learning frames are necessary to update the end-to-
   end datapath and cause data traffic to resume expeditiously. The
   time delay between the completion of the connection handshake and
   the first learning frame MUST NOT be counted as part of the roaming
   delay attributed to the DUT or SUT.
</p>
<p>The 802.11 protocol contains numerous shortcuts and enhancements
   (e.g., preauthentication, PMKID caching, and opportunistic key
   caching) that are designed to speed up the roaming process. Most of
   these features are optional. The tester SHOULD implement as many of
   these optional features as possible, to enable the roaming
   performance of the DUT or SUT to be measured under different
   scenarios.  Any optional speed-up features that have been used in a
   test MUST be reported with the results.

Trial duration</h3>

<p>The duration of each trial SHOULD be selected using the guidelines of
   Section 24 of RFC 2544 <a class='info' href='#RFC2544'>[RFC2544]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S. and J. McQuaid, &ldquo;Benchmarking Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>. Further, it SHOULD be long enough
   to minimize any connection setup and startup effects that can affect
   the test results. In the case of tests involving WTPs (i.e., APs),
   the trial duration SHOULD also be long enough to make the random
   fluctuations of the CSMA/CA access method statistically
   insignificant.
</p>
<p>The recommended duration of each trial is 60 seconds. The trial
   duration MAY be adjustable between 30 seconds and 300 seconds. The
   tester MUST transmit all test data frames within the trial duration.
   To eliminate the case where a device possessing large frame buffers
   can appear to be faster than it actually is, the tester MUST NOT
   accept received test data frames for more than 2 seconds beyond the
   end of the trial duration. (Thus a 60 second trial duration causes
   the tester to receive frames for no more than 62 seconds, starting
   from the beginning of the trial.) Frames received outside of these
   limits MUST NOT be counted as part of the results.
</p>
<p>The trial duration MUST NOT include the time taken for initial
   connection setup and system state stabilization, unless this is
   specifically part of the test. For example, authentication and
   association of wireless clients can take a relatively long time; if
   this is included within the trial duration of a throughput test, the
   results will be significantly affected. This also applies to
   spanning tree convergence and other connection state settling delays.

Benchmarking tests</h3>

<p>The following tests are divided into two categories: data plane
   tests and control plane tests.
</p>
<p>Data plane tests relate to the performance of the traffic handling
   functions of the DUT or SUT; the results of such tests are mainly
   governed by the packet forwarding hardware and software. Control
   plane tests, on the other hand, stress the connection setup and
   context management capabilities of the DUT or SUT, and the results of
   these tests are dictated by the performance of the CPU(s) and
   front-end traffic classification and exception handling mechanisms.
</p>
<p>The correlation between system performance and data plane metrics
   such as throughput and latency is well known, of course. The
   performance of the management and security protocols in a WLAN,
   however, are also key determinants of the perceived user experience.
   For example, support of 802.11-based VoIP handsets is of significant
   interest in an enterprise environment; however, poor roaming
   performance can make such handsets nearly unusable except in a fixed
   usage model. Thus it is important to quantify control plane metrics
   as well.
</p>
<p>This section treats data plane and control plane tests separately.
   Objectives, test parameters, procedures and reporting formats are
   described for each test.

Data plane tests</h3>

<p>Data plane tests comprise the following:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>   Unicast and multicast throughput and forwarding rate
</p>
<p>   Latency and jitter
</p>
<p>   QoS differentiation
</p>
<p>   Burst capacity
</p>
<p>   Power-save throughput
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughput and forwarding rate tests have an obvious correlation to
   end-user perceptions of the speed and capacity of the wireless LAN.
   For throughput and forwarding rate tests, either the Frame Based or
   Time Based modes of testing may be used, as described in Appendix B
   of RFC 2889 <a class='info' href='#RFC2889'>[RFC2889]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mandeville, R. and J. Perser, &ldquo;Benchmarking Methodology for LAN Switching Devices,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>.  The DUT or SUT is initially set up according
   to the baseline configuration, using a starting combination of test
   parameters.  Packets are then sent to the DUT or SUT by the tester
   at a specific offered load for the duration of the trial, and the
   number of frames received from the DUT or SUT are counted.  The
   process MUST be iterated at different offered loads, using a search
   algorithm, until the desired measurement (throughput or maximum
   forwarding rate) has been made.  Additional trials are then
   performed in the same manner using different DUT or SUT
   configurations until all configurations have been exhausted.
</p>
<p>Latency and jitter tests are principally of interest in delay
   sensitive applications such as voice and video. Jitter tests use the
   smoothed interarrival jitter calculation method described in RFC
   3550 <a class='info' href='#RFC3550'>[RFC3550]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H., Casner, S., Frederick, R., and V. Jacobson, &ldquo;RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>. A means of timestamping transmitted frames is
   required in order to calculate both latency and jitter.
</p>
<p>QoS differentiation tests seek to quantify the performance of the
   DUT or SUT when handling traffic such as VoIP that requires
   preferential treatment over best-effort data traffic.  This is
   particularly important in WLANs, not only because of the growing use
   of Voice over WLAN (VoWLAN) handsets, but also because of the limited
   bandwidth available over the wireless medium. (Wired enterprise LANs
   have heretofore dealt with the QoS problem by throwing bandwidth at
   the problem, as QoS is mainly an issue in oversubscribed links; due
   to spectrum limitations this pleasantly simple approach is not
   simple or practicable in a wireless context.)
</p>
<p>Burst capacity and power-save throughput deal with the unique need
   for WLAN infrastructure devices to buffer considerable amounts of
   data, in order to compensate for unpredictable variations in the
   links to wireless endstations. The wireless media may experience
   rapid variations in capacity due to rate adaptation,
   requiring the infrastructure devices to buffer packets until higher-
   layer protocols such as TCP can 'catch up'. In addition, wireless
   endstations themselves may elect to enter a low-power mode in order
   to extend battery life, again requiring the WLAN infrastructure to
   buffer packets until the endstation wakes up and calls for the data.
   As the loss of even a few packets has a substantial impact on upper
   layer protocols such as TCP, the burst capacity and power-save
   throughput of the DUT or SUT can significantly affect the end-user
   experience.
</p>
<p>In all of the data plane tests, the tester MUST count as valid
   received test frames only those which it receives without error
   within the testing time window, with the proper signature, and
   correctly directed (i.e., having the right combination of source and
   destination addresses, frame length and payload). All other frames
   (including management/control frames) MUST NOT be included when
   computing the test results.
</p>
<p>For the purposes of computing the actual offered load, the tester
   MUST count as valid transmitted frames only those test frames that
   were acknowledged by the DUT on the wireless medium (i.e., with an
   802.11 ACK frame), or transferred to the DUT or SUT without a locally
   detected error on the wired medium within the testing time window.
   All other frames MUST NOT be counted as part of the offered load.
   Note that this is only applicable to tests involving WTPs.
</p>
<p>In addition, in tests involving WTPs the tester must only count as
   valid those unique data frames for which it sent an 802.11 ACK frame
   to the DUT or SUT in response.  It MUST NOT count duplicate frames,
   frames originating from the DUT, data frames that it did not
   acknowledge, or management and control frames as part of the
   measurements.  Such frames MAY be counted separately for diagnostic
   purposes, or not counted at all.

Objective</h3>

<p>To determine the throughput of the DUT or SUT when forwarding
   unicast data frames between the wireless and the wired sides of the
   DUT or SUT.  The results of this test can be used to determine the
   ability of an AC to support multiple wireless endstations
   transferring data to a wired LAN segment.
</p>
<p>Note that while the IEEE 802.11 wireless medium has a high frame
   error ratio relative to wired media, the low-level acknowledgement
   and retransmission protocol implemented by the 802.11 MAC effectively
   results in nearly zero loss as seen by the IP layer.  In fact the
   loss ratio at the MAC service interface of an 802.11 device is no
   worse than the loss ratio for a wired Ethernet device. (Obviously a
   high frame error ratio on the wireless medium will then manifest
   itself as a reduced throughput at the MAC service interface, but
   the signal level precautions described in section 3.4.8 will ensure
   that the maximum possible throughput is obtained.)
</p>
<p>The general setup for the test comprises one or more virtual or
   physical endstations on the wireless side of the DUT or SUT that
   transfer data to or from one or more virtual endstations on the
   wired side.

Procedure</h3>

<p>The DUT or SUT is first set up according to the baseline
   configuration, using the initial setting of frame size.  The initial
   offered load is computed per Appendix A to equal the aggregate
   theoretical maximum capacity of all the wireless-side links.  For
   bidirectional tests involving WTPs, the tester MUST follow the
   half-duplex test conditions described in Section 3.4.7.  The
   throughput is then measured as described below.  The measurement is
   repeated for each value of frame size.
</p>
<p>The tester MUST send learning frames (after endstation connection
   setup as applicable) to allow the DUT or SUT to update its address
   tables properly. A search algorithm is used to determine the
   throughput.
</p>
<p>After the baseline configuration has been tested, the tester MAY
   repeat the process with a new configuration, until the desired number
   of different configurations have been exercised.
</p>
<p>In tests involving multiple endstations (either on the wireless or
   the wired side, or both), the tester MUST ensure a uniform
   distribution of frames from each source endstation. In addition, all
   permissible combinations of source and destination addresses
   (consistent with the traffic direction setting) MUST be represented
   equally within each trial.  This distributes the load of
   transmission and reception uniformly among the endstations. Note

   frame loss, at some value of offered load.  The offered load applied

</p>
<p>If the maximum forwarding rate of a SUT (containing WTPs) exceeds

<p>The tester MUST send learning frames (after endstation connection

Objective</h3>

<p>The limited capacity of the wireless medium makes it imperative to
   implement effective QoS schemes in order to successfully support
   delay and loss sensitive traffic such as voice and video. Many ACs
   and WTPs implement extensive classification and prioritization
   functions to ensure that high levels of best-effort data traffic do
   not adversely impact the delay, jitter and packet loss of higher
   priority real-time traffic.
</p>
<p>This test therefore seeks to quantify the level to which the DUT or
   SUT isolates real-time traffic from best-effort data traffic that
   is sharing the same channel.  This is done by injecting progressively
   higher levels of best-effort traffic into the DUT or SUT until the
   QoS requirements of a previously established real-time stream are
   no longer met.  Ideally, the DUT or SUT will not permit the

   regardless of the offered load of the former.  A poor QoS
   implementation will result in the QoS requirements of the real-time

   traffic. The results of this test can hence be used to estimate
   the effectiveness of the QoS implementation within the DUT or SUT

<p>The general setup for the test comprises one or more virtual or

   exercise the QoS handling functions of the DUT. This test is only
   applicable to DUTs or SUTs that are capable of recognizing and
   prioritizing real-time traffic.

Procedure</h3>

<p>The DUT or SUT is initially set up according to the baseline
   configuration, and the wireless endstations are associated with it.
   A constant bidirectional stream of real-time traffic is injected
   into the DUT or SUT (i.e., one stream from the wireless side to the
   Ethernet side and an identical stream from the Ethernet side to the
   wireless side).
</p>
<p>The real-time traffic frames MUST be formatted to ensure that the
   DUT or SUT assigns them a higher priority than normal best-effort
   data frames. The frame size and frame rate of the real-time traffic
   MUST resemble a single G.711 voice stream (240 byte RTP payloads,
   30 frames/second) as closely as possible.  The maximum latency,
   smoothed interarrival jitter and packet loss MUST be measured for
   each direction of each real-time traffic stream over the entire
   trial duration.
</p>
<p>The tester MUST then inject a stream of best-effort data traffic
   into the Ethernet side of the DUT or SUT, directed at the wireless
   endstations, using an initial frame size and starting offered load
   (computed per Appendix A), and running for the entire trial
   duration.  The tester MUST monitor the QoS parameters of the
   real-time traffic over the trial duration.  A search algorithm
   SHOULD be used to find the highest value of best-effort offered
   load (up to and including the theoretical maximum capacity of the
   Ethernet medium, minus the bandwidth occupied by the real-time
   traffic) for which the QoS threshold is not violated.
</p>
<p>The measurements are repeated for each value of frame size.  
   Identifying tags or signatures MUST be placed in each frame sent to
   the DUT or SUT during the measurement interval, so that the
   real-time and best-effort data frames can be distinguished from
   each other and correlated with the frames received from the DUT.
</p>
<p>The tester MUST send learning frames (after endstation connection
   setup as applicable) to allow the DUT or SUT to update its address
   tables properly. If multiple endstations are used, the traffic
   topology MUST be of the partially meshed one-to-many/many-to-one
   type.
</p>
<p>After the baseline configuration has been tested, the tester MAY
   repeat the process with a new configuration, until the desired number
   of different configurations have been exercised.
</p>
<p>When testing with multiple endstations on the wireless side and/or
   Ethernet side, consecutive best-effort data frames transmitted by
   the tester to the DUT or SUT MUST have different combinations of
   source and destination addresses, and all possible such combinations
   of addresses MUST be represented equally within each trial.  This
   distributes the delay impact and traffic load uniformly among the
   endstations.  Failure to ensure this can lead to inconsistent
   results.

Objective</h3>

<p>To measure the ability of the DUT or SUT to support mobile
   endstations in power management mode.  Endstations in power
   management mode go into a sleep state (including turning off their
   radios) frequently, in order to save battery power.
</p>
<p>WLAN infrastructure devices that support wireless endstations in
   power management mode (i.e., sleeping endstations) are required to
   accept and buffer frames on behalf of these endstations and signal
   the endstations that frames are being buffered for them. The
   sleeping endstations will wake periodically at a pre-configured
   listen interval and check for buffered frames, going back to sleep
   only after transferring the buffered frames (if any).  Buffer
   management and notification functions must therefore be efficiently
   implemented in the DUT or SUT in order to sustain a large population
   of endstations in power management mode.
</p>
<p>This test measures the power management mode throughput of the DUT
   or SUT, and hence its ability to efficiently support many connected
   but sleeping endstations.

Procedure</h3>

<p>The DUT or SUT is initially set up according to the baseline
   configuration.  The tester then associates the required number of
   wireless endstations with the DUT or SUT and causes these
   endstations to immediately enter power-save (sleep) mode. The tester
   MUST transmit learning frames to and from the endstations, and MUST
   then wait a sufficient length of time to ensure that the endstations
   have entered power-save mode successfully.
</p>
<p>The tester then transmits test data frames at a starting offered
   load (computed according to Appendix A) to the Ethernet side of the
   DUT or SUT for forwarding to each of the sleeping endstations. The
   initial offered load SHOULD be set to the aggregate theoretical
   maximum capacity of all of the wireless-side links. A search
   algorithm is then used to determine the throughput. The measurement
   is repeated for each value of frame size.
</p>
<p>After the baseline configuration has been tested, the tester MAY
   repeat the process with a new configuration, until the desired number
   of different configurations have been exercised.
</p>
<p>In tests involving multiple endstations (either on the wireless or

   of frames from each source endstation. In addition, all permissible

   each trial.  This distributes the traffic and power-save buffer load
   uniformly among the endstations. Note that this corresponds closely

</p>
<p>   WTP capacity
</p>
<p>   Reset recovery time
</p>
<p>   Failover recovery time
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The endstation roaming delay and rate tests directly measure the
   capacity of the DUT or SUT to support mobility on the part of the
   endstations, and are generally considered to be important for
   enterprise networks. The test results can, for example, indicate
   whether VoIP handsets can roam from WTP to WTP without causing a loss
   in voice quality (due to dropouts or lost voice samples). It is
   generally considered that the roaming delay should be considerably
   less than the time between two or three VoIP packets to avoid having
   a material impact on voice traffic.
</p>
<p>The endstation association rate and capacity tests attempt to
   quantify the ability of the DUT or SUT to efficiently support large
   numbers of connected endstations. Each endstation is represented by
   a significant amount of state maintained within the AC (and sometimes
   even the WTPs). The implementation of efficient state management and
   update algorithms is necessary in order to avoid issues such as slow
   rates of endstation connection or even outright disconnection of
   successfully associated endstations when new endstations attempt to
   connect.
</p>
<p>The WTP capacity test is applicable to ACs only, and measures the
   scalability of the DUT. Modern enterprise WLANs may require hundreds
   or even thousands of WTPs to be deployed to provide adequate
   coverage. This test therefore quantifies the size of the WLAN that
   may be practically constructed using the DUT.
</p>
<p>Reset recovery and failover recovery measurements are essential
   indicators of the robustness, uptime and stability of a WLAN that is
   deployed using the DUT or SUT. Rapid recovery from catastrophic
   events such as equipment failure or power glitches is a key
   requirement for an enterprise network carrying critical data.  A
   long reset recovery time can cause timeouts and connection drops at
   the transport and application layers, and may even cause endstations
   to be disconnected.
</p>
<p>Data traffic streams in control plane tests are used principally as
   indicators of successfully completed events, handshakes or trials.
   The frame sizes, flow rates and flow directions of data traffic
   do not particularly affect the test results. Hence the test
   parameter specifications for control plane tests in this document
   generally fix these at convenient values.

Objective</h3>

<p>The 802.11 protocol enables a endstation to dynamically disassociate
   itself from one WTP and reassociate with another WTP in the same
   domain.  This is done to facilitate the mobility (or roaming) of
   endstations within an extended region that constitutes a single
   logical LAN covered by multiple WTPs. The time required for
   endstations to transition from one WTP to another plays a large role
   in the perceived quality and reliability of the mobile system. Long
   roaming delays can result in lost data and dropped connections. This
   test seeks to determine the delay experienced by endstations when
   roaming between WTPs belonging to the DUT or SUT.
</p>
<p>In 802.11 networks, endstations are the primary drivers of roaming
   behavior, and actually initiate the decision to roam. WTPs and ACs,
   are significant contributing factors to the total roaming delay, in
   terms of the time required for them to accept and complete
   connection and security handshakes and resume traffic flow to and
   from the endstation; however, endstations also contribute to some of
   the delays. Endstation and WTP roaming time contributions are thus
   measured and reported separately.
</p>
<p>This test MUST be carried out on a DUT or SUT that involves two or
   more physical interfaces on the wireless side; if the SUT includes
   WTPs, then two or more WTPs MUST be present.

<a name="rfc.section.5.2.1.3"></a><h3>5.2.1.3.&nbsp;
Procedure</h3>

<p>The tester connects the wireless endstations with the DUT or SUT in a
   uniformly distributed manner (i.e., each physical interface or WTP
   is presented with the same number of endstations). It then injects a
   continuous stream of traffic into the Ethernet side of the DUT or SUT
   that is destined for the wireless endstations. The traffic
   distribution MUST be uniform, i.e., the same offered load is set up
   for all of the wireless endstations.
</p>
<p>The frame size of the injected traffic MUST be set as per section
   3.4.3.  The aggregate injected traffic load, as observed at any
   wireless interface, MUST NOT exceed 50% of the theoretical maximum
   capacity of that interface, to avoid seriously hampering the ability
   of the DUT or SUT to transfer the management frames that are
   exchanged during roaming handshakes.  Note that the resolution of
   the roaming delay measurement is inversely proportional to the frame
   rate of the injected traffic, and hence MUST be calculated and
   reported with the test results.
</p>
<p>The tester then causes the wireless endstations to roam from
   interface to interface (from WTP to WTP, if WTPs are present in the
   SUT), and measures the roaming delay. After the trial duration has
   expired, the traffic is stopped and the minimum, maximum and average
   roaming delay contribution of the DUT or SUT, the average number of
   lost packets per roam, and the number of failed roams are measured
   and reported.  The tester SHOULD report these results on a per-
   virtual-WLAN basis, and MAY report the results on a per-endstation
   basis as well.
</p>
<p>As described in Section 3.4.12, the test MUST be performed with a
   baseline DUT or SUT setup of intra-subnet, intra-AC roaming.
</p>
<p>The DUT or SUT configuration parameters are initially set up and
   tested according to the baseline.  After the baseline configuration
   has been tested, the tester MAY repeat the process with a new set of
   configuration parameters, until the desired number of different
   configurations have been exercised. In particular, inter-subnet
   and/or inter-AC roaming situations SHOULD be tested. If these
   situations are tested, each situation SHOULD be tested with the same
   combination of test parameters, to enable the results to be compared.
</p>
<p>The trial duration MUST be set to allow every endstation to roam at
   least once, and SHOULD be set to allow every endstation to perform a
   complete circuit of all of the interfaces and return to the starting
   point. Note that with a large number of endstations, this may
   require a fairly long trial duration.

Analysis and reporting</h3>

<p>The roaming delay contribution of the DUT or SUT is measured by
   subtracting the roaming delay contribution of the endstation from the
   overall roaming delay, and is expressed in seconds. The roaming
   delay contribution of the endstation is calculated by adding up all
   the delays (excluding packet transmission delays) incurred by the
   endstation due to internal processing, during the process of moving
   from one interface/WTP to another interface/WTP.
</p>
<p>The average number of lost packets per roam is calculated by
   subtracting the total number of data traffic packets received by the
   endstations from the total number of data traffic packets sent to the
   endstations, and dividing by the total number of roams performed.
</p>
<p>The number of failed roams is measured as the number of times that
   the DUT or SUT failed to begin transferring data packets to a
   endstation after the endstation completed the roaming process.
</p>
<p>The results SHOULD be reported in tabular format. Separate results
   MUST be reported per DUT or SUT configuration and test scenario
   (i.e., intra/inter-subnet and intra/inter-AC). The results MAY be
   also reported as profiles (a graph over time) to enable better
   understanding of the roaming behavior of the DUT or SUT.

</p>
<p>The tester then causes the wireless endstations to roam from
   interface to interface (from WTP to WTP, if WTPs are present in the
   SUT) at a constant rate for the duration of the trial. Roam events
   MUST be triggered in a serial fashion, i.e., only one roam is

Procedure</h3>

<p>The DUT or SUT is first set up according to the baseline
   configuration.  The tester then presents the required number of
   virtual or physical test endstations to the DUT or SUT for
   connection, and measures the rate at which the DUT or SUT
   successfully completes associations. The tester MUST pipeline the
   associations (i.e., begin the association of the next endstation
   before the previous endstation has been fully associated) in order
   to present the DUT or SUT with as high a load as possible. The
   tester MUST record the actual average rate at which new endstations
   were presented over the course of the trial period.
</p>
<p>If all of the endstations presented to the DUT or SUT fail to
   associate, then the tester MUST deauthenticate the associated
   endstations, reduce the association rate, and repeat the trial. If
   all of the endstations succeed in associating, the tester MUST
   increase the association rate and repeat the trial. The process
   continues until the maximum association rate is found. A search
   algorithm SHOULD be used to speed up the process.
</p>
<p>It is recommended that the authentication and association database
   capacity test in Section 5.2.3 be performed first to determine the
   maximum number of endstations that can successfully associate with
   the DUT. The number of virtual endstations presented to the DUT
   SHOULD be kept below this number. 
</p>
<p>After the test endstations successfully authenticate and associate
   with the DUT or SUT, the tester MUST verify that these endstations
   have indeed been associated by transmitting test data frames to the
   endstations, and ensure that these data frames are correctly
   forwarded by the DUT or SUT. The rate at which verification data
   frames are transmitted to the DUT or SUT MUST be well below the
   theoretical maximum capacity of the links. The tester MUST ensure
   that at least one data frame directed to each endstation is
   forwarded.
</p>
<p>If the DUT or SUT deauthenticates or disassociates one or more
   endstations during the data transfer phase, these MUST be counted as
   association failures. If none of the test data frames transmitted to
   a endstation are forwarded successfully, this MUST be treated as a
   verification failure. If failures do occur, the tester SHOULD
   attempt to find a lower rate of association for which no
   verification failures are found for all of the test endstations.
</p>
<p>After the baseline configuration has been tested, the tester MAY
   repeat the process with a new configuration, until the desired number
   of different configurations have been exercised.  If the DUT or SUT
   supports a built-in DHCP server, at least one of the configurations
   tested SHOULD include endstations receiving their addresses via DHCP.
   (Provisioning IP addresses via DHCP is a very common situation in
   WLANs.)
</p>
<p>After each trial has been completed, the tester MUST remove the test
   endstation associations from the DUT or SUT database by performing
   the 802.11 deauthentication procedure for each endstation.

Objective</h3>

<p>To determine the number of WTPs that an AC can successfully
   support at one time. This test is only applicable to ACs.
</p>
<p>The CAPWAP protocol enables an AC to discover, initialize, configure,
   manage and transfer data to/from a number of WTPs. The total number
   of WTPs that a single AC can support can range into the hundreds,
   implying that the management load on the AC can be quite substantial,
   and the ability of the AC to support and maintain the WTPs will play
   a substantial part in the performance and uptime of the LAN.
</p>
<p>This test therefore measures the ability of the DUT or SUT to
   support and maintain a large number of WTPs, each of which is
   concurrently supporting a large number of endstations, each of which
   is sinking and/or sourcing data traffic.
</p>
<p>This test may be carried out with actual (physical) WTPs, or by
   using test equipment capable of emulating WTPs and the wireless
   endstations behind them. If emulated WTPs are used, they must
   implement the management protocol (e.g., CAPWAP) employed between
   the WTPs and the ACs. If actual WTPs are used, emulation is not
   necessary, but the WTP capacity of the AC must then be determined by
   manually connecting and disconnecting physical WTPs.

Procedure</h3>

<p>The DUT or SUT is first set up according to the baseline
   configuration.  The tester then presents an initial number of
   virtual or physical test WTPs to the DUT.  The test WTPs SHOULD be
   presented as nearly simultaneously as possible.  If the DUT or SUT
   fails to initialize the number of test WTPs successfully within the
   initialization timeout, the tester MUST consider the trial to have
   failed, and another trial MUST be performed with a smaller number of
   WTPs.  If the DUT or SUT succeeds in initializing all of the test
   WTPs, the test WTPs should be removed, and the next trial performed
   with a larger number, until the no more test WTPs can be connected.
</p>
<p>Once all of the test WTPs have been successfully connected and
   initialized, the tester MUST associate the configured number of
   endstations with each WTP, and then MUST cause traffic to flow to
   and/or from each endstation between the wireless and Ethernet sides
   of the DUT. The tester MUST first send learning frames (after
   endstation connection setup as per the security mode) to allow the
   DUT or SUT to update its address tables properly.
</p>
<p>In tests involving multiple endstations per WTP, the tester MUST
   ensure a uniform distribution of frames to/from each endstation. In
   addition, all permissible combinations of source and destination
   addresses (consistent with the traffic direction setting) MUST be
   represented equally within each trial, to distribute the load of
   transmission and reception uniformly.
</p>
<p>If the DUT or SUT deauthenticates one or more test endstations, the
   tester MUST attempt to reauthenticate these endstations. If the
   tester fails to reauthenticate the endstations, then the trial MUST
   be considered to have failed, and MUST be repeated with a smaller
   number of WTPs.  If the DUT or SUT disconnects from one or more
   WTPs, or reboots, the trial MUST be considered to have failed, and
   MUST be repeated with a smaller number of WTPs.  A successful trial
   is one in which the specified number of test WTPs remain connected
   to the DUT or SUT and the specified number of test endstations are
   able to remain associated and successfully pass traffic for the
   trial duration.
</p>
<p>After the baseline configuration has been tested, the tester MAY
   repeat the process with a new configuration, until the desired number

<p>During the middle of the trial period, the DUT or SUT is reset, and
   then allowed to recover normally.  The reset process of the DUT or

   providing predefined configurations that are not part of normal
   operational practice). The tester MUST monitor the data traffic
   being received by the wireless endstations before, during and after
   the reset period, and MUST record the timestamps of the last valid
   data frame received just after the reset is applied and the first
   valid data frame received just after the reset duration completes
   and the reset is removed. The reset recovery time is then calculated
   and reported as below.
</p>
<p>A power-interruption reset test MUST be performed.  If the DUT or

   test SHOULD be repeated with the software and hardware resets.  The
   results MUST be reported separately.

<p>Devices that are not considered to be part of the DUT or SUT MUST NOT

   availability and uptime of a wireless network. In critical
   situations, it is common to provide backup ACs that are capable of
   taking over when a primary AC fails. Rapid restoration of service is
   essential to avoid issues such as dropped VoIP calls and lost TCP
   connections.
</p>
<p>This test quantifies the time taken for a WLAN infrastructure
   DUT or SUT to restore service following a failure of a primary AC.
   Note that this test is only applicable to DUTs/SUTs that implement
   redundant ACs or AC modules. Further, this test is only feasible in
   situations where the primary AC or AC module can be disabled or
   removed without powering down the DUT or SUT, and while traffic is
   flowing.

</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>   Number of WTPs, Number of wireless endstations per WTP, Offered

<p>The baseline DUT or SUT configuration for performing this test

   DHCP not used, and a single virtual WLAN.

<a name="rfc.section.5.2.7.3"></a><h3>5.2.7.3.&nbsp;
Procedure</h3>

<p>The DUT or SUT is set up according to the baseline configuration.
   The tester should then associate the virtual or physical
   endstation(s) with the WTPs, and transmit test data between the
   wireless and Ethernet sides of the DUT or SUT according to the
   configured traffic direction for the trial duration.
</p>
<p>During the middle of the trial period, the primary AC is disabled in
   one of the following ways:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>   Removal from the chassis (if implemented as a hot-swappable
        module)
</p>
<p>   Powering it down (if implemented as a separately powered device)
</p>
<p>   Disconnection from the rest of the DUT or SUT (if disconnection is
        possible by removing a single link)
</p>
<p>   Disabling it under software control
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The software disable method SHOULD be used only as a last resort, if
   no other means of disabling the primary AC is found. The method used
   to disable the primary AC MUST be described along with the test
   results.
</p>
<p>The tester MUST monitor the data traffic being received by the
   wireless endstations before and after the primary AC is disabled. If
   data traffic is interrupted during the trial for any reason, the
   tester MUST record and report the duration of the interruption as the
   failover recovery time. Note that it is possible for the failover
   recovery to be fully transparent to the data traffic, in which case
   the failover recovery time is effectively zero.
</p>
<p>The tester MUST distinguish between valid test traffic frames and
   other frames (e.g., corrupted frames, management frames, random
   data frames) and MUST use only valid test traffic frames in the
   measurement process.
</p>
<p>If the test endstations are disconnected or disassociated from the
   DUT or SUT during the failover recovery period, the tester MUST
   attempt to reconnect the test endstations immediately, and continue
   to attempt to reconnect the test endstations until successful (or
   until the trial ends, whichever is sooner). Disconnection of one or
   more test endstations during the failover recovery period MUST be
   reported with the test results. Failure to restore traffic to one or
   more test endstations after the primary AC has been disconnected
   MUST be reported with the test results.

Intended load computations</h3>

<p>Calculating intended load for 802.11 media access is complicated by
   the number of different parameters that need to be accounted for as
   well as the random effect of backoff and management overhead. This
   appendix provides formulas for the theoretical maximum capacity of
   the media, actual intended load, and inter-burst gap.
</p>
<p>Note that the instantaneous capacity of the 802.11 medium changes
   from transmission to transmission due to the effects of random
   backoff after each transmission. The formulas presented here are
   therefore expected to be applied over a large volume of traffic,
   rather than individual frames or bursts of frames.  In addition, the
   parameters used in the formulas change for different 802.11 physical
   layers and also different data rates used within a particular
   physical layer.

<p>The following intermediate values are calculated first:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>   TXTIME - Time required to transmit a single Data frame or
      fragment.  For transfers that do not involve an RTS/CTS exchange,
      this is the time taken to transmit the Data frame plus an

For transfers involving an RTS/CTS exchange, this is
      the time taken to transmit an RTS, CTS, Data and ACK frame.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>   For RTS/CTS based transfers:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>      TXTIME = (PLCPTIME * 4) + (SIFS * 3) + (((LENGTH + 48) * 8) /
      SPEED)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>   For transfers not involving RTS/CTS:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>      TXTIME = (PLCPTIME * 2) + SIFS + (((LENGTH + 14) * 8) / SPEED)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>   AMFI - Average Minimum Frame Interval. This is the minimum legal
      interval between the start of a Data frame and the start of the
      immediately following Data frame, averaged over a large number of
      Data frames.
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>      AMFI = TXTIME + DIFS + ((CWmin * SLOTTIME) / 2)

<p>The above formula does not take into account overhead due to

Calculating constant intended load</h3>

<p>The calculations in this section deal with a constant (steady) load
   generated by the tester (i.e., a constant frame pattern). Burst loads
   are covered in the next section.
</p>
<p>If the DUT or SUT is not to be overloaded, the intended
   unidirectional traffic load can range from 0 to 100% of the
   theoretical maximum media capacity previously calculated (0 to 50%
   in the case of bidirectional traffic streams).  See Section 3.5.1 of
   RFC 2285 <a class='info' href='#RFC2285'>[RFC2285]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mandeville, R., &ldquo;Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices,&rdquo; February&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> for a full definition of Iload.  For the purposes
   of this document, the intended load is expressed as a percentage of
   the theoretical maximum media capacity, and calculated as Iload
   using the following formula:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>   Iload = (LOAD / CAP) * 100
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where LOAD is the load in bits/second, and CAP is calculated as in
   Section A.1.
</p>
<p>In order to actually generate traffic at Iload values less than 100%,
   the tester must insert extra spacing between frames to reduce the
   traffic load.  This extra spacing is referred to here as EFG (Excess
   Frame Gap), and is calculated as follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>   EFG = AMFI * ((100 / Iload) - 1)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The actual frame interval therefore becomes (AMFI + EFG). The traffic
   pattern generated by the tester hence consists of a Data frame, the
   corresponding ACK frame (from the DUT), a gap equal to the DIFS plus
   the average minimum backoff time, and a further gap equal to EFG.
</p>
<p>Generating Iload values greater than 100% requires that the tester
   violate the backoff rules of the 802.11 protocol. The tests in this
   document do not require Iload values greater than 100%.

Calculating burst intended load</h3>

<p>This section deals with the computation of intended load when the
   traffic pattern is bursty. A bursty pattern comprises a series of
   back-to-back Data/ACK exchanges separated by a DIFS, followed by a
   gap, followed by another series of back-to-back exchanges, and so on.
   The gap between bursts (referred to as the IBG) is selected based on
   the intended load. In addition, the IBG is calculated such that the
   Iload for bursty and constant traffic are directly comparable. (See
   Section 3.4.3 of RFC 2285 <a class='info' href='#RFC2285'>[RFC2285]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mandeville, R., &ldquo;Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching Devices,&rdquo; February&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> for a discussion of IBG.)
</p>
<p>The following input parameters are defined, in addition to those
   defined above:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>   BURST - Length of burst in frames.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a given Iload, the IBG is calculated as:
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>   IBG = DIFS + (AMFI * BURST * ((100 / Iload) - 1))
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that the IBG is measured from the last bit of the ACK frame of
   the last data frame in a burst to the first bit of the preamble of
   the first data frame in the next burst.
