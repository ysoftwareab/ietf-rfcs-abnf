1.  Introduction

   One of the many checks that mail servers carry out is to query DNS
   whitelists (DNSWL, [RFC5782]).  The lookup is based on the connecting
   client's IP address, so this check can occur very early in an SMTP
   transaction.  The result can be used to counterweight policies that
   typically occur at early stages too, such as the Sender Policy
   Framework (SPF, see in particular the last paragraph of Appendix D.3
   of [RFC7208]).  In addition, the result of a DNSWL lookup can also be
   used at later stages; for example, a delivery agent can use it to
   estimate the spamminess of an email message.  The latter possibility
   needs a place to collect query results for downstream use, which is
   precisely what the Authentication-Results header field aims at
   providing.

   Results often contain additional data, encoded according to DNSWL-
   specific criteria.  The present method considers only whitelists
   --one of the major branches considered by [RFC5782].  In case of
   DNSxL, the boundary MTA (see [RFC5598]) which carries out the check
   and possibly stores the result, has to be able to discern at least
   the color of "x".  It is required to make accept/reject decisions.

   Additional data can be stored as result's parameters.  In effect,
   they are tantamount to local policies, albeit outsourced.  Downstream
   agents can take advantage of DNSWL-specific knowledge to make finer
   decisions, such as render additional information or deliver to
   apposite folders.

2.  Method Details

   The following ptype.property items define the relevant parameters
   where additional data can be stored.  They augment the "pass" result
   with information about the entry found.

   dns.zone:   DNSWL query root domain, which defines the meaning of the
               result.  Note that an MTA can use a local mirror with a

               different name.  The name stored here has to be the best
               available reference for all foreseable downstream
               consumers.

   policy.ip:  The bit mask value received in type A response, in dotted
               quad.  This entry can be repeated if the DNSWL returns
               multiple A records.

   policy.txt: The TXT record, if any.  Multiple records are
               concatenated.

   The result of the method states how the query did, up to the
   interpretation of the result.  In particular, some DNSBLs are known
   to return special codes to signal over quota, for example
   127.0.0.255.  If the result producer cannot interpret that value,
   that case results in a false positive.

   pass:       The query successfully returned applicable records.  The
               sender is whitelisted, up to differing interpretation.

   none:       The query worked but yielded no record, or returned
               NXDOMAIN, so the sender is not whitelisted.

   temperror:  The DNS evaluation could not be completed due to some
               error that is likely transient in nature, such as a
               temporary DNS error, e.g., a DNS RCODE of 2, commonly
               known as SERVFAIL, or other error condition resulted.  A
               later attempt may produce a final result.

   permerror:  The DNS evaluation cannot work because test entries don't
               work, that is, DNSWL is broken, or because queries are
               overquota, e.g., a DNS RCODE of 5, commonly known as
               REFUSED, or a DNSWL-specific policy.ip was returned.  A
               later attempt is unlikely to produce a final result.
               Human intervention is required.

3.  IANA Considerations

   There is a registry of Email Authentication Methods created by
   RFC7601.  The method described in this document is referred by
   Table 1, along its ptype.property values.  A new "ptype" is
   introduced in Table 2.

4.  Security Considerations

   All of the considerations described in Section 7 of [RFC7601] apply.

   In addition, the usual caveats apply about importing text from
   external online sources.  Although queried DNSWLs are well known,
   trusted entities, it is suggested that TXT records be reported only
   if, upon inspection, their content is deemed actually actionable.  If
   they contain non-ASCII characters, they need to be encoded as
   appropriate.
