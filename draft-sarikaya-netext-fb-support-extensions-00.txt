Internet-Draft      PMIPv6 Support for Flow Mobility       February 2010


1.  Introduction

   In Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775] multi-homing is supported efficiently due to
   the use of home address.  Mobile node uses its home address as the
   source address and all incoming traffic is directed to the home
   address (HoA).  When multiple interfaces are concurrently active the
   home agent (HA) has to decide how to route incoming packets to
   different active interfaces.  HA does this based on the flow
   bindings.  MN has to register its active flows with the HA and HA
   keeps flow binding entries for each HoA.  HA then forwards packets to
   one of the care-of addresses of an active interface after matching it
   with an ordered list of flow bindings.

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] lacks a similar mechanism because each
   active interface is treated separately and a different binding cache
   entry is created.  This document proposes changes necessary to the
   local mobility anchor (LMA) behaviour so that flow mobility can
   seamlessly be supported in PMIPv6.  The changes to the mobile node
   considered in [I-D.yokota-netlmm-pmipv6-mn-itho-support] are also
   needed to complement our solution on the host side.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC5213], [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding] in addition to the ones
   specified in this section:

   Single-Radio MN:  Consider MN with two interfaces.  These interfaces
      are implemented in such a way that MN can keep one radio module
      (interface) active at a given time.
   Dual/multiple-Radio MN:  Consider MN with two interfaces.  These
      interfaces are implemented in such a way that both radio modules
      can receive and transmit simultaneously.
   Inter-technology handover:  Sometimes called vertical handover.  A
      multi-homed MN communicates with one interface at any time to
      conserve power.  Each interface can support different access
      technology.  Inter-technology handover occurs when MN moves out of
      coverage of one technology and moves into the coverage area of
      another technology which will result in switching of the
      communicating interface on MN
      [I-D.yokota-netlmm-pmipv6-mn-itho-support].

3.  Problem Statement

   When MN connects simultaneously with multiple interfaces each
   interface is treated independently and MN uses different source
   addresses when sending packet over these interfaces.  However in case
   of flow mobility, MN itself or LMA might wish to move one flow from
   one interface to the other.  When a flow is moved from interface A to
   interface B, MN has to stop sending packets on interface A, i.e. it
   should set the source address to an address based on HNPs assigned to
   interface B. Forcing an MN to do this after a flow is moved is
   difficult currently and is one of the problems PMIPv6 flow mobility
   is facing.

   The solution for this is to let MN always use a source address from
   HNPs assigned to its home interface.  When multiple interfaces are
   active, incoming packets can be directed to different active
   interfaces based on flow state established at LMA.

   When MN does an inter-technology handover, the new MAG sends a Proxy
   Binding Update (PBU) message to the local mobility anchor (LMA) to
   register the new proxy care-of address.  In the PBU, MAG sets the
   access technology type (ATT) and handoff indicator (HI) values.  If
   ATT is different from the one stored in the existing binding cache
   entry for this MN and if HI is set to 2 (Handoff between two
   different interfaces of the mobile node), LMA concludes that an
   inter-technology handover happened and assigns the same home network
   prefix(es) to MN which enables IP session continuity.

   Setting the access technology type correctly might prove easier for
   MAGs that are connected to a single technology.  Currently this could
   be the most popular case.  However with the advent of fixed mobile
   convergence this is likely to change.  MAGs in the future are
   expected to serve more than one access technologies.

   Setting the handoff indicator correctly is also not so easy.  Most
   MAGs would tend to set HI to 1 (Attachment over a new interface)
   which would result in LMA setting new prefix(es) to MN and creating a
   new binding cache entry and allocating a new mobility session for
   this new interface.  This behaviour as described in Section 5.4 of
   [RFC5213] needs to be changed.


4.   Multihoming Case

   When there is attachment over a new interface (HI value received in
   the Binding Update from MAG is 1) LMA creates a new binding cache
   entry and assigns the flag "S" to all home network prefixes assigned
   to this interface.  Also this flag is set in the binding



Sarikaya & Xia           Expires August 5, 2010                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      PMIPv6 Support for Flow Mobility       February 2010


   acknowledgement sent to MAG.  LMA MUST also include the home network
   prefixes with "H" flag in the BA message.  This should enable MN
   continue to send packets with source addresses selected from HNPs
   with "H" flag on.

   The new binding cache entry does not create a new mobility session.
   The entry is considered as a pointer to another binding the same MN
   has with LMA.  MN may have as many such binding entries as it has
   interfaces.  These secondary binding cache entries are refreshed
   regularly by MAGs sending BUs.  MAG MUST include HNPs both with "H"
   and "S" flags in the BU message.


5.  LMA Operation

   When LMA receives a Binding Update meesage which contains Handoff
   Indication set to a value of 1 LMA MUST create a new binding cache
   entry and assign new home network prefixes for this interface.  The
   flag MUST be assigned to "S".  This binding cache entry becomes part
   of the binding cache entry that contains home network prefixes with
   "H" flag.

   LMA sends home network prefixes assigned to the new interface in the
   Binding Acknowledgement message.  LMA MUST also set the flag to "S".
   In the same BA message, LMA also sends home network prefixes whose
   associated flag is "H" in the same BA.

   The modifications specified in this document allow a mobile node to
   have a single interface connected at a given moment and that
   interface has prefixes assigned an "S" flag, i.e. the binding with
   the home interface may have expired.  In this case LMA MUST also
   store the home network prefixes with "H" flag in the binding cache
   entry.

5.1.  Extensions to Binding Cache Entry

   A flag associated with the following binding cache entry: list of
   IPv6 home network prefixes assigned to the mobile node's connected
   interface.  The flag is set to "H" if the connected interface is the
   home interface and is set to "S" if the connected interface is not.

   The prefixes assigned after the first PBU is received for MN are
   assigned "H" flag.  The handoff between two different interfaces does
   not require the prefixes to be changed in order to allow session
   continuity.  Because of this the flag (of "H" or "S") associated with
   the prefixes stays the same.

   This specification also brings the change that binding cache entries



Sarikaya & Xia           Expires August 5, 2010                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      PMIPv6 Support for Flow Mobility       February 2010


   for the same MN-Identifier are considered together.  The number of
   entries is equal to the number of active interfaces of MN.  If there
   is a single entry it is assumed that the flag value is "H", otherwise
   the prefixes with "H" flag should also be stored in the binding cache
   entry.

   For an incoming packet, the destination address MUST be selected from
   the set of prefixes with "H" flag.  LMA decides to which interface to
   route this packet by consulting the flow binding entries list,
   similar to the case in Mobile IPv6 [I-D.ietf-mext-flow-binding].  The
   packet will be matched against the flow descriptions in the flow
   binding entries list and Proxy-CoA of the matching entry will be
   determined.  Next, binding cache entry for this MN will be searched
   and the packet will be directed to the MAG to which the matching
   interface is connected.


6.  MAG Operation

   When MAG detects an attachment over a new interface it sets Handoff
   Indicator field to 1 as described in [RFC5213] in the Binding Update
   message that it sends to LMA.

   MAG MUST store home network prefixes it receives in Binding
   Acknowledgement message from LMA together with the flag in the
   binding update list entry.  If the flag is "S" MAG MUST also store
   all home network prefixes in the BA message whose flag is "H" in the
   corrsponding binding update list entry.

6.1.  Extensions to Binding Update List Entry Data Structure

   A flag associated with the following binding update list entry: list
   of IPv6 home network prefixes assigned to the mobile node's connected
   interface.  The flag is set to "H" if the connected interface is the
   home interface and is set to "S" if the connected interface is not.

   MAG MUST also store the home network prefixes with flag "H" in
   addition to the prefixes associated with the connected interface if
   the flag of the home network prefix assigned to the connected
   interface is "S".


7.  Message Formats

   Home Network Prefix Option defined in [RFC5213] is modified to
   include a flag to indicate if home network prefixes are assocaited
   with "H" flag or "S" flag in the binding cache entries.

                   Figure 1: Home Network Prefix Option

   H Flag

      This flag is set when this prefix is assigned to a secondary
      interface of the mobile node and when the binding cache entry for
      this HNP has "S" flag set.  This flag is not set when this prefix
      is assigned to the firstly connecting or the only connected
      interface of the mobile node and when the binding cache entry for
      this HNP has "H" flag set.
