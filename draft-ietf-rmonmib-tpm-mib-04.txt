2.  Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Informa-
   tion Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the
   Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects used
   for monitoring selectable performance metrics and statistics derived
   from the monitoring of network packets and application sub-transac-
   tions.  The metrics are defined through reference to existing IETF,
   ITU and other standards organizations' documents.  The monitoring
   covers both passive and active traffic generation sources.

4.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major compo-
   nents:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the mes-
        sage protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of proto-
        col operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC
        1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine

   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

5.  Overview

   This document continues the architecture created in the RMON MIB
   [RFC2021] by providing a major feature upgrade, primarily by provid-
   ing new metrics and studies containing the metrics to assist in the
   analysis of performance for traffic flow in the network, in direct
   relationship to the transporting of application layer protocols.

   Performance monitoring agents have been widely used to analyze the
   parameters and metrics related to the perceived performance of dis-
   tributed applications and services in networks.  The metrics col-
   lected by these agents has ranged from basic response time to a com-
   bination of metrics related to the loss and re-transmission of data-
   grams and PDUs.  While the metrics are becoming more useful in the
   implementation of service level monitoring and troubleshooting tools,
   the lack of a standard method to report these in has limited the
   deployment to very specific customer needs and areas.

   This document is intended to create a general framework for the col-
   lection and reporting of performance related metrics on traffic flows
   in a network.  The MIB in this document in directly linked to the
   current RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021] and uses the Protocol Directory as a key
   component in reporting the layering involved in the traffic flows.

   The specific objectives of this document are to:

      + Provide a drill-down capability to compliment the user-perceived
      monitoring defined within the APM MIB [APM].  This capability is
      intended to support trouble resolution, further characterization
      of performance, and a finer granularity of monitoring capabili-
      ties.  The APM MIB provides a method for retreiving aggregated
      measurement data of the end-user's perception of application-level
      performance.  APM additionally provides thresholding and associ-
      ated alarms in the event the end-user perceived performance
      degrades below defined thresholds.  The TPM MIB compliments the
      APM MIB capabilities by monitoring sub-transaction level aspects
      of the application not typically percieved by the end-user.  As an
      example, APM MIB provides response time statistics of a typical
      web-browser application.  This application typically consists of
      DNS transaction, TCP connection establishment (or multiple estab-
      lishments), HTTP download of the base page and multiple downloads
      of the various embedded objects.  Ideally TPM MIB would provide
      statistics on the performance aspects of these multiple sub-trans-
      actions.

      + Provide additional performance metrics and related statistics.
      For trouble shooting and a finer gransularity of performance moni-
      toring, it is useful to provide measurements of additional metrics
      beyond those supported by the APM MIB.

      + Support standards based metrics and associated statistical
      aggregation by defining methods to reference those standards.  The
      TPM MIB provides a capability to describe metrics by reference to
      appropriate IETF, ITU or other standards defining metrics.  This
      capability is provided through the tpmMetricsDefTable.

      + Provide (as an option) a history table storing the N last mea-
      surements of the metric and protocol in question.  APM MIB pro-
      vides aggregated statistics of end-user perceived performance.
      There are times when it is necessary to have access to the raw
      measurements.  The tpmHistoryTable optionally provides access to
      this capability.


   While this document outlines the basic measurements of performance in
   regard to the transporting of application flows, it does not attempt
   to measure or provide a means to measure the actual perceived perfor-
   mance of the application transactions or quality.  The detailed mea-
   surements of end-user perceived performance is directly related to
   this document and may be found in the APM MIB [APM].

   The objects defined in this document are intended as an interface
   between an RMON agent and an RMON management application and are not
   intended for direct manipulation by humans.  While some users may
   tolerate the direct display of some of these objects, few will toler-
   ate the complexity of manually manipulating objects to accomplish row
   creation.  These functions should be handled by the management appli-
   cation.

5.1.  Terms

   This document uses some terms that need introduction:

   DataSource
        A source of data for monitoring purposes. This term is used
        exactly as defined in the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021].

   protocol
        A specific protocol encapsulation, as identified for monitoring
        purposes. This term is used exactly as defined in the RMON
        Protocol Identifiers document [RFC2074].

   performance metric

        A specific statistical reporting metric, as identified for
        monitoring purposes.  There can be several metrics reported by
        an agent in the same implementation.  The metrics are
        extensible based on the agent implementation.

5.2.  Report Aggregation

   This MIB provides functions to aggregate measurements into higher
   level summaries.

   Every traffic flow is identified by its protocol, server, and client
   and has one or more metrics related to the performance of the trans-
   port protocol for a given application flow. For example, in a 5
   minute period several transactions might be recorded:

       Protocol  Client  Server   Metric
       HTTP      Jim     Amazon   50
       SAP/R3    Jane    SAP      20
       HTTP      Joe     HR       35
       FTP       Jim     ietf     20
       HTTP      Joe     HR       15
       RealVideo Joe     CNN      18
       HTTP      Jane    HR       22

   These traffic flows can be aggregated in several ways, providing sta-
   tistical summaries - for example summarizing all HTTP transported
   flows, or all HTTP transported flows to the HR Server.  Note that
   data from different protocols may not be summarized because:

      1. The performance characteristics of different protocols
      differ widely enough to render statistical analysis
      meaningless.

      2. The transport metrics of different protocols may be
      different, making a statistical analysis impossible.

   Aggregating traffic flows collected over a period requires aggrega-
   tion algorithms. Several are provided:

   FlowCount
       The total number of traffic flows during this period

   SuccessfulFlows
       The total number of traffic flows that were opened and
       closed

   For example, when aggregating the previous set of transactions by
   protocol we get (for simplicity the example only shows FlowCount,

   SuccessfulFlow, and a generic metric):

       Protocol  Count Metric
       HTTP      4     3
       SAP/R3    1     1
       FTP       1     1
       RealVideo 1     1

   There are four different types of aggregation.

      The flows(1) aggregation is the simplest. All traffic
      flows that share common protocol/server/client 3-tuples
      are aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics
      for all such unique 3-tuples.

      The clients(2) aggregation results in somewhat more
      aggregation (i.e. fewer resulting records). All
      traffic flows that share common protocol/client tuples are
      aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for all
      such unique tuples.

      The servers(3) aggregation usually results in still more
      aggregation (i.e. fewer resulting records). All
      traffic flows that share common protocol/server tuples are
      aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for all
      such unique tuples.

      The protocols(4) aggregation results in the most
      aggregation (i.e. the fewest resulting records). All
      traffic flows that share a common protocol are aggregated
      together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique
      protocols.

5.3.  Structure of the MIB

   The objects are arranged in the following groups:

       -- transport performance metric to protocol directory

       -- transport performance metric studies

       -- transport performance metric reports


5.4.  Statistics for Aggregation of Data - Conventions

   In order to properly measure the performance of traffic flows in a
   network, the proper analysis of a set of statistics is required.

   Since a large majority of the statistics have a basis of time, the
   use of a simple statistical model is feasible.  Therefore, the MIB
   definitions within this document all use a basic set of statistical
   computed values to assist in further analysis by a management appli-
   cation.

   The remaining subsections in this section detail the common struc-
   tured features the are applied to the performance metrics in the sta-
   tistical format described above.  The tpmMetricsDefTable (discussed
   below) describes the set of metrics supported in this MIB-set frame-

5.5.  Relationship to the Remote Monitoring MIB

   This document describes the implementation of an additional MIB for
   the support of performance related metrics within the framework of
   the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021].  The objects and table defined in this MIB
   are an extension to the existing framework for the support of both
   Client/Server and Server push related applications and services.

5.6.  Relationship to RMON MIB Protocol Identifier Reference

   This document uses the Protocol Indentifiers outlined in the current
   Protocol Identifier Reference document, RFC 2074 [RFC2074].  The pro-
   tocol index values throughout the document are a direct reference to
   the same relationship that exists between the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021]
   and the Protocol Identifier Reference document, RFC 2074 [RFC2074].

5.7.  Relationship to Standards-Based Performance Metric References

   This document uses the tmpMetricsDefTable to describe the metrics
   supported by an instance of the TPM MIB.  The performance metric
   index values throughout the document are a direct reference to the
   metrics defined in that table.

5.8.  Relationship to Application Performance Measurement MIB

   This document uses the apmReportControlIndex, appLocalIndex and apm-
   ReportIndex as outlined in the current Application Performance Mea-
   surement MIB draft document [APM].  These objects are used to create
   a reference link for the purpose of reporting traffic flow details on
   application protocol measurements.

6.  Statistics Perspective

   When dealing with time based measurements on application data packets
   it would be ideal if all the timestamps and related data could be
   stored and forwarded for later analysis.  However when faced with

   thousands of conversations per second on ever faster networks, stor-
   ing all the data, even if compressed, would take too much processing,
   memory, and manager download time to be practical.

   Fortunately there is a branch of mathematics that has studied methods
   for describing such sets of data.  Pick up any book on statistics and
   in the first several chapters techniques and methods will be pre-
   sented that can be applied to time based measurements.  As an added
   benefit, the study of statistics also has a large body of existing
   knowledge on analysis of the data derived data.

   It is important to note that in dealing with network data we will be
   dealing with statistical populations and not samples.  Statistics
   books deal with both because the math is similar.  In collecting
   agent data a population, i.e. all the data, must be processed.
   Because of the nature of application protocols just sampling some of
   the packets will not give good results.  Missing just one critical
   packet, such as one that specified an ephemeral port on which data
   will be transmitted, or what application will be run, can cause much
   valid data to be lost.

   The time-based measurements the agent collects will come from examin-
   ing the entire group of data, i.e. the population. The population
   will be finite.  The agent will seek only to provide information that
   will describe the actual data. Analysis of that data will be left to
   the management station.

   The simplest form of representing a group of data is by frequency
   distributions, buckets.  Statistics provides a great many ways of
   analyzing this type of data and there are some rules in creating the
   buckets.  First the range needs to be known. Second a bucket size
   needs to be determined.  Fixed bucket sizes are best, while variable
   may be used if needed.  However the statistics texts tend to only
   refer to operations of fixed size buckets.  This method of describing
   data is expensive for a agent to implement.  First the agent must
   process a great amount of data at a time. In storing the data, deter-
   mine the range, then locating the buckets and then fill in the data
   after the fact takes too much storage and too much time.  Fixing the
   range and bucket sizes in the beginning can be problematical as the
   agent may have to adjust the values for each of the applications it
   collects data on.  Such numbers can be in the thousands.  Additional
   complexity arises in adding new protocols and even in describing the
   buckets themselves to the management application.

   Frequency distribution statistics describes aggregation such as mean
   and standard deviation that can be obtained by summation functions on
   the individual data elements in a population.  Analysis of the data
   described by these functions has been greatly studied and

   interpretation of these values is available to anyone with an intro-
   duction to statistics.  In fact, frequency distributions are rou-
   tinely analyzed to generate these varied numbers which are then used
   for further analysis.  Also note that frequency distributions by
   their very nature, buckets, introduce error factors that are not pre-
   sent with direct analysis by a summation type formulas.

   The agent will provide data that can be used to calculate the most
   basic and useful statistical aggregates.  The agent will not perform
   the calculations and provide the statistical measurement directly.
   There are several reason why this is not desired. The first is that
   to find the final measurement can be expensive in terms of computa-
   tion and representation.  There are divisions and square roots and
   the measurements are expressed as floating point values.  The second
   is that by providing the variables to the statistical functions,
   those variables are scalable.  It is possible to combine smaller
   intervals into larger ones.

   An example is the arithmetic mean or average.  This is the sum of the
   data divided by the number of data elements.

   The agent will provide 2 OIDs, the first the sum of the x, the second
   the number of elements N. The management station can perform the
   division to obtain the average.  Given two samples, they can be com-
   bined by adding the sum of the x's and by adding the number of ele-
   ments to get a combined sum and number of elements.  The average for-
   mula then works just the same.  Also the sum of the x and the number
   of element variables are used in calculating other statistical mea-
   surement values as well.

6.1.  Statistics Structure

   The data statistical elements, datum, of the metric have been chosen
   to maximize the amount of data available while minimizing the amount
   of memory needed to store the statistic and minimizing the CPU pro-
   cessing requirement needed to generate the statistic.

   The statistic data structure contains five unsigned integer datum.

   A performance metric is used to describe events over a time interval.
   The events, data points, can be processed immediately into the

   statistic and do not have to be stored for later processing.  For
   example to count the number of events in a time interval it is suffi-
   cient to increment a counter for each event, it is not necessary to
   cache all the events and then count them at the end of the interval.
   The statistic is also designed to be easily scalable in terms of com-
   bining adjacent intervals.  For example if an agent created a spe-
   cific statistic every 30 seconds and a user table interval was set to
   60 seconds, the 60 second statistic could be obtained by combining
   the two 30 second statistics.  The following rules will be applied
   when combining adjacent statistics.

             N         SN
             SX        S(S (X))
             S (X2)    S(S (X2))

             Xmin      MIN(Xmin)
             S IX      SIX + NSX +SIX
             S (IX2)   SI(SI (X2))

   The following approximates the CPU processing requirements needed to
   update a specific statistic.

       5 additions
       3 multiplication
       2 comparisons
       6 assignments.

   The statistic structure gives a generic framework upon which the
   actual performance statistics will be defined.  Each specific statis-
   tic definition must address the specific significance, if any, given
   to each of the metric datum.  While a specific metric definition
   should try to conform to the generic framework, it is ok for a metric
   datum to not be used, and to have no meaning, for a specific metric.
   In such cases the datum will default to a 0 value.

6.2.  Statistics Analysis

   The actual meaning of a specific statistic datum is determined by the
   definition of the specific statistic.  The following is a discussion
   of the operations and observations that can be performed on a generic
   metric.  This means that the following may or may not apply and/or
   have meaning when applied to any specific metric.

   The following observations and analysis techniques are not all inclu-
   sive.  Rather these are the ones we have come up with at the time of
   writing this document.

       Number.

       Frequency.

       The time interval is the time interval specified in the control
       table.  It is not a metric datum, but it is associated with the
       metric sample.

6.3.  Statistics Cutting Room Floor

   During the design of the statistic structure different data elements
   were proposed, examined, and then either put in the statistic or left
   out of the statistic.  The following is what was considered but did
   not make it into the statistical set.

    o   Sum of the deltas.  The trend enumeration can be based on this
        easy calculation.  It didn't make it because it could be nega-
        tive, which would have meant another MIB variable to specify
        sign information.  And the number is an ambiguous measure of
        slope as seen by comparing the following two series of values.
        The sum of the delta in both cases is 6-2 = 4.

                Series A:    2,  6, 10,  6,  6,   6,   6,   6,   6,  6
                Series B:    2,  2,  2,  2,  6,  10,  10,  10,  10,  6

    o   Sum of the absolute values of the delta values.  This would pro-
        vide a measurement of the overall movement within an interval.
        A value for the average change could be calculated.  This mea-
        surement gives no indication of trend or grouping of data within
        the interval.  It usefulness in measuring Performance metric
        could not be determined.

    o   Sum of positive delta values and sum of the negative delta val-
        ues.  These did not give much more useful information than the
        sum of the deltas and took 2 data elements to represent.
        Expanding each of these with an associated count and maximum
        would give nice information, but at a total of 6 data elements
        for this data alone.  Therefore it was deemed too expensive in
        terms of memory.

    o   The statistical measurement of skew can be obtained by adding
        S(X3) to the existing metric.  This would have meant an addi-
        tional multiply, and additional MIB variable, and possibly over-
        flow problems if X is sufficiently large.

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].  The
        statistical measurement of kurtosis can be obtained by adding
        S(X3) and S(X4) to the existing statistical set.  This would
        have meant two additional multiplies, 2 additional MIB vari-
        ables, and an even larger chance of overflow is X is suffi-
        ciently large.  And in this case large is really not so large.

11.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure envi-
   ronment without proper protection can have a negative effect on net-
   work operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   In order to implement this MIB, an agent must make certain management
   information available about protocols and network addresses used
   within a managed system, which may be considered sensitive in some
   network environments.

   Therefore, a network administrator may wish to employ instance-level
   access control, and configure the TPM MIB access (e.g., community
   strings in SNMPv1 and SNMPv2C), such that certain instances within
   this MIB (e.g., tpmReportMetricStatisticN), are excluded from partic-
   ular MIB views.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security fea-
   tures as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of
   the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly config-
   ured to give access to the objects only to those principals (users)
   that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/cre-
   ate/delete) them.

B.  Outstanding Issues

   This section will ultimately be removed from the document. It cap-
   tures a list of open issues that need to be resolved as this document
   is discussed.

      + It may be desirable to define or include additional statistics
      as experience is gained in the implementation and use of this MIB.
      How should this MIB be made to support the extensions of addi-
      tional statistics?

      + Is the tpmMetricDefType and the tpmMetricDefDirType needed?

      + Is the tpmTransactionMetricDirTable sufficiently flexible to
      "describe" the performance measuments desired from a complex
      application, like CAP-WEB.

      + Should the TPM MIB track error codes?
