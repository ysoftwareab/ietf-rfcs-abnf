1.  Introduction

   An Application Data Model (ADM) provides a guaranteed interface for
   the management of an application or protocol in accordance with the
   Asynchronous Management Architecture (AMA) defined in
   [I-D.birrane-dtn-ama].  The ADM described in this document complies
   with the ADM Template provided in [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm] as encoded
   using the JSON syntax.

   The ION IPN (Interplanetary Internet) Scheme Administration ADM
   contains all of the functionality that is required to configure the
   routing of bundles from a local node to an endpoint that conforms to
   the IPN scheme.

1.1.  Technical Notes

   o  This document describes Version 0.0 of the ION IPN Admin ADM.

   o  The Asynchronous Resource Identifier (ARI) for this ADM is NOT
      correctly set.  A sample ARI is used in this version of the
      specification and MAY change in future versions of this ADM until
      an ARI registry is established.  This notice will be removed at
      that time.

   o  Agent applications MAY choose to ignore the name, description, or
      other annotative information associated with the component
      definitions within this ADM where such items are only used to
      provide human-readable information or are otherwise not necessary
      to manage a device.

1.2.  Scope

   This ADM specifies those components of the Asynchronous Management
   Model (AMM) common to the configuration of the IPN scheme in ION.

   Any Manager software implementing this ADM MUST perform the
   responsibilities of an AMA Manager as outlined in
   [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm] as they relate to the objects included in this
   document.

   Any Agent software implementing this ADM MUST perform the
   responsibilities of an AMA Agent as outlined in [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm]
   as they relate to the objects included in this document.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Structure and Design of this ADM

   The IPN Admin ADM's structure is in accordance to
   [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm].  This ADM contains metadata, edd, table
   templates, and controls.  Externally Defined Data (EDD) are values
   that are calculated external to the ADM system.  Table Templates are
   column templates that will be followed by any instance of this table
   available in the network.  They may not be created dynamically within
   the network by Managers.  Controls are predefined and sometimes
   parameterized opcodes that can be run on an Agent.  Controls are
   preconfigured in Agents and Managers as part of ADM support.There are
   no variables, report templates, macros, constants, or operators in
   this ADM at this time.  The contents of this ADM are derived from the
   main functions and data that are needed for configuration in
   accordance with the IPN scheme.

   There are two categories of functions in IPN.  They are ones that
   deal with egress plans (plans for unobstructed and continuous ways of
   exit travel) and ones that deal with exits for static default
   routing.  These plans and exits are discussed throughout the ADM.

   All ADMs have metadata that includes the name, namespace, and version
   of the ADM as well as the name of the organization that is issuing
   that particular ADM.  This is important for identification purposes
   of the ADMs and to ensure version control.  All of the functions that
   are related to the configuration of IPN in ION are present in this
   document.

3.  Naming and Identification

   This section outlines the namespaces used to uniquely identify ADM
   objects in this specification.

3.1.  Namespace and Nicknames

   In accordance with [I-D.birrane-dtn-adm], every ADM is assigned a
   moderated Namespace.  In accordance with [I-D.birrane-dtn-amp], these
   namespaces may be enumerated for compactness.  The namespace and ADM
   identification for these objects is defined as follows.

                  +-----------------+------------------+
                  |    Identifier   |      Value       |
                  +-----------------+------------------+
                  |    Namespace    | DTN/ION/ipnadmin |
                  |                 |                  |
                  | ADM Enumeration |        6         |
                  +-----------------+------------------+

                      Table 1: Namespace Information

   Given the above ADM enumeration, in accordance with
   [I-D.birrane-dtn-amp], the following AMP nicknames are defined.
