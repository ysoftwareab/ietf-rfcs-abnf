Internet-Draft      FMIPv6 over Point-to-Point Links           July 2007


Abstract

   The FMIPv6 specification currently does not explicitly define the
   operation over Point-to-Point links.  In this document we define
   FMIPv6 operation over the point-to-point links, especially we propose
   mechanism for assigning unique prefixes to the MN by the PAR.  Three
   different solutions are proposed.  A new access router dynamically
   assigns a unique prefix called dedicated prefix to any MN that is
   performing a handover.  Alternatively, the previous access router
   sends an aggregate prefix of a new access router to MN for
   formulating NCoA, and only when handover takes place, the new access
   router assigns a dedicated prefix to MN and configures a NCoA for the
   MN.  Lastly, MN is allowed to generate a special NCoA without any
   specific prefix information, and only when handover takes place, the
   new access router assigns a dedicated prefix to MN for NCoA
   formulation.  Both reactive and predictive modes of FMIPv6 are
   explained.

Internet-Draft      FMIPv6 over Point-to-Point Links           July 2007


1.  Introduction

   Fast handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6)
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis] aims at reducing the handover
   latency by reducing the time to configure a new care-of address (CoA)
   for a mobile node (MN).  In FMIPv6, MN formulates a prospective new
   CoA (NCoA) when it is still present on the previous access router
   (PAR)'s link.

   [I-D.ietf-16ng-ipv6-link-model-analysis] provides different IPv6 link
   models that are suitable for 802.16 based networks and provides
   analysis of various considerations for each link model and the
   applicability of each link model under different deployment
   scenarios.  [I-D.ietf-16ng-ipv6-over-ipv6cs] specifies the addressing
   and operation of IPv6 over the IPv6 specific part of the packet
   convergence sublayer of IEEE Std 802.16e [802.16e], and Point-to-
   Point Link Model is recommended.  Also, 3GPP and 3GPP2 have earlier
   adopted the point-to-point link model based on the recommendations in
   [RFC3314].

   In this document, we first explain the problems associated with
   FMIPv6 on point-to-point links followed by a detailed explanation of
   the modified FMIPv6 operation on point-to-point links.

   In Section 3 we describe why the point-to-point link address
   formation procedures are needed in FMIPv6, in Section 4 we define
   various procedures NAR can use to assign per-MN prefixes in point-to-
   point links and in Section 5 we define necessary messages/option for
   the operation in Section 4.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis], in addition to the ones
   specified in this section.

   Point-to-Point Link Model:  In this model, a set of MAC transport
      connections between an MN and an AR are treated as a single link.
      Each link is allocated a separate, unique prefix or a set of
      unique prefixes by the AR.  Please refer to
      [I-D.ietf-16ng-ipv6-link-model-analysis] for detail.  In this
      model, a host's only neighbor is its default router.

Internet-Draft      FMIPv6 over Point-to-Point Links           July 2007



   Aggregate Prefix:  In Point-to-Point Link Model, AR should broadcast
      the prefixes (MNs route information) dynamically upstream, and
      this causes high routing protocol traffic (IGMP, OSPF, etc.).  To
      solve the problem, route aggregation should be used.  For example,
      each AR can be assigned a /48 prefix, while an MN's /64 prefix is
      derived from the /48 prefix extension.  The main, higher-level
      prefix is called the Aggregate Prefix.  An AR only broadcasts the
      aggregate prefix upstream.

   Dedicated Prefix:  A unique prefix used by MN in Point-to-Point Link
      Model.

   Provisional NCoA:  The prefix part of the NCoA is an aggregate prefix
      or a special prefix.

   Modified NCoA:  The prefix part of the NCoA is a dedicated prefix.


3.  Problem Statement

   The following are operations as per
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis]:
   o  Movement detection.  The protocol enables an MN to quickly detect
      that it has moved to a new subnet by providing the new access
      point and the associated subnet prefix information when the MN is
      still connected to its current subnet.  For instance, an MN may
      discover available access points using link-layer specific
      mechanisms (i.e., a "scan" in WLAN) and then request subnet
      information corresponding to one or more of those discovered
      access points.  An MN sends a Router Solicitation for Proxy
      Advertisement (RtSolPr) to its access router to resolve one or
      more Access Point Identifiers to subnet-specific information.  In
      response, the access router sends a Proxy Router Advertisement
      (PrRtAdv) message containing one or more [AP-ID, AR-Info] tuples,
      which an MN can use in readily detecting movement: when attachment
      to an access point with AP-ID takes place, the MN knows the
      corresponding new router's coordinates including its prefix, IP
      address, and L2 address.
   o  NCoA configuration.  AR-Info contains an access router's L2 and IP
      addresses, and the prefix valid on the interface to which the
      Access Point (identified by AP-ID) is attached.  With the prefix
      provided in the PrRtAdv message, the MN formulates a prospective
      NCoA.

   In Point-to-Point link model, each MN has one or more dedicated
   prefixes, that is, different MNs have different prefixes.  The
   prefixes could be allocated dynamically.  When an MN attaches to an



Xia & Sarikaya           Expires January 6, 2008                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      FMIPv6 over Point-to-Point Links           July 2007


   AR, the AR should delegate one or more dedicated prefixes for it;
   when the MN detaches from the AR, the MN's prefixes are released, and
   can be reused by other MNs.  The number of unique prefixes in this
   operation can be huge.

   NCoA formulation process in point-to-point links depends on the type
   of prefix offered in AR-Info.  [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis]
   does not specify such dependencies.  If a dedicated prefix is
   offered, then PAR SHOULD request the dedicated prefix from NAR and
   the prefix SHOULD be reclaimed if MN does not complete the handover.
   If an aggregate prefix is offered, then a modified NCoA SHOULD be
   formulated from the dedicated prefix.

   After NCoA is formulated from a dedicated prefix, other operations
   such as proxying NCoA with proxy neighbor cache at the NAR and
   duplicate address detection need to be specified.  This is also
   missing in [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis].

   In short, FMIPv6 operation on point-to-point (p2p) links needs to be
   defined.  We next define the operations related to NCoA formulation
   on point-to-point links.


4.  FMIPv6 Operation on Point-to-Point Links

   Three different solutions are proposed.

4.1.  Solution 1

   The simplest fix to the problem described in the previous section is
   as follows: NARs assign a unique prefix to each MN that could
   handover under this NAR.  This prefix will be included in AR-Info.
   PAR sends this prefix in the PrRtAdv message.  In the PrRtAdv
   message, A-bit and L-bit MUST be turned on.

   New FMIPv6 message exchange is introduced for PAR to ask for MN's
   dedicated prefix as shown in Figure 1.  In
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis], HI is assumed to be sent after
   the FBU for handover indication.  Here, modified of HI/Hack messages
   are used for prefix request/response.  Details are described in
   Section 5.

   The new AP-ID is included in RtSolPr for PAR to locate the
   corresponding NAR.

   NAR MAY use DHCP prefix delegation (PD) to request/ release prefixes
   from a DHCP server.  NAR collocated with DHCP Client MAY use the
   signaling defined in [I-D.sarikaya-16ng-prefix-delegation] after

   being triggered by the HI for prefix request.  NAR MAY also use AAA
   prefix delegation (PD) to request/ release prefixes for this MN from
   an AAA server.  NAR collocated with AAA Client MAY use the signaling
   defined in [I-D.sarikaya-16ng-prefix-delegation] after being
   triggered by the HI message for prefix request.

                        Figure 1: Prefix Signaling

   In Network-initiated Handover scenario, there isn't specific RtSolPr
   to trigger PAR to request a prefix.  In this case, implementation
   specific trigger SHOULD be used by PAR to send HI for prefix request.

4.2.  Solution 2

   The main idea of this solution is to include an aggregate prefix in
   the AR-Info and the MN then uses this prefix to formulate NCoA.  We
   call it provisional NCoA.  Each aggregate prefix advertised by the
   candidate NARs MUST be unique.

   The following adaptation can be used in predictive mode of FMIPv6:



Xia & Sarikaya           Expires January 6, 2008                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      FMIPv6 over Point-to-Point Links           July 2007


   o  An MN receives aggregate prefix in AR-Info of PrRtAdv, and
      formulates its provisional NCoA according to [RFC2462], [RFC3041]
      or other mechanisms.  Then, the MN sends FBU message to PAR with
      NCoA option, link layer information of MN, and so on.  The PAR
      sends this information to an NAR in HI message.  In order to
      determine the NAR's address for the HI message, the PAR can
      perform longest prefix match of NCoA (in FBU) with the prefix list
      of neighboring access routers.
   o  HI message defined in [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis] is
      extended here.  A Code value of 3 is defined Section 5.1.
   o  On receiving the HI, NAR processes the message as per
      [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis] if the Code value is not 3.
      Otherwise, the NAR allocates one or more dedicated prefixes for
      the MN based on it's link-layer information contained in HI
      message.  NAR generates a new NCoA by replacing the provisional
      NCoA's prefix part with the dedicated prefix.
   o  The modified NCoA is then delivered to the MN in the NCoA field of
      HAck/FBack messages.  MN MUST use the modified NCoA.

   The following adaptation can be used in the reactive mode of FMIPv6:
   o  MN sends UNA to NAR.  The source address of UNA is the provisional
      NCoA.  If the prefix of the NCoA in the UNA message is not an
      aggregate prefix, the NAR processes the message as per
      [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis].  Otherwise, the NAR assigns
      one or more prefixes for the MN based on Link-Layer Address (LLA)
      option in the UNA.  NAR MAY use DHCP/AAA protocol to request/
      release prefixes for this MN from a DHCP/AAA server triggered by
      UNA using [I-D.sarikaya-16ng-prefix-delegation].  A modified NCoA
      is formulated by replacing the provisional NCoA's prefix part with
      the dedicated prefix.  The NAR MUST send a Router Advertisement
      with the NAACK option in which it includes the modified NCoA to
      the source IP address present in UNA.  The MN MUST use the
      modified NCoA.  NAR MAY advertise more dedicated prefixes to MN in
      subsequent RAs.
   o  MN sends the FBU to the PAR with source address set to the
      modified NCoA.

4.3.  Solution 3

   There are two main functions for PrRtAdv and RtSolPr exchange.  One
   is fast movement detection, and the other is prefix acquisition for
   NCoA formulation [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis].

   In this solution, RtSolPr is not necessary, while PrRtAdv is only
   used for fast movement detection.  An unsolicited PrRtAdv is used to
   inform the MN about geographically adjacent ARs without the MN having
   to explicitly request that information.  This can reduce the amount
   of wireless traffic required for the MN to obtain a neighborhood



Xia & Sarikaya           Expires January 6, 2008                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      FMIPv6 over Point-to-Point Links           July 2007


   topology map of links and ARs.  When attachment to an access point
   with AP-ID takes place, the MN knows the corresponding new router's
   co-ordinates including its IP address and L2 address, and thus MN can
   decide to attach to the NAR or not.

   MN initiates fast handover procedure once movement detection occurs.
   At first, MN formulates a provisional NCoA without any information
   about it's new prefix in the coming handover, so it uses a special
   prefix which could be all-one or a random value to stuff the prefix
   part of the NCoA.  The special prefix could also be the prefix MN
   receives in AR-Info [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis].  The
   interface identifier part of the NCoA is calculated according to
   [RFC2462], [RFC3041] or other mechanism.

   In the predictive mode, MN sends FBU with provisional NCoA from PAR's
   link.  The new AP-ID is included in FBU for PAR to locate the
   corresponding NAR.  PAR then sends HI to NAR.  HI message defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis] is extended here.  A Code value
   of 3 is defined Section 5.1.

   On receiving the HI, NAR processes the message as per
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis] if the Code value is not 3.
   Otherwise, NAR allocates a dedicated prefix for MN, replaces prefix
   part of the provisional NCoA and sends HAck in response.

   In the reactive mode, MN first sends UNA to NAR.  The source address
   of UNA is the provisional NCoA.  NAR then allocates a dedicated
   prefix, replaces the special prefix of the provisional NCoA with the
   dedicated prefix, and sends a RA with an NAACK option in which the
   modified NCoA is included.  The MN SHOULD use the modified NCoA.
   Subsequently, MN sends the FBU to the PAR with source address set to
   the modified NCoA.

4.4.  Applicability of Solutions

   Comparing with solution 2 and solution 3, solution 1 has better
   compatibility with the specification defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis], even though there are two new
   messages exchanged between ARs.


5.  HI and Hack Extension

5.1.  HI Extension

   The Handover Initiate (HI)defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis] is an ICMPv6 message sent by an
   Access Router (typically PAR) to another Access Router (typically

Internet-Draft      FMIPv6 over Point-to-Point Links           July 2007


   NAR) to initiate the process of a MN's handover.

   In this document, HI is extended with two new code values:
   o  In [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis], the PAR uses a Code value
      of 0 when it processes an FBU with PCoA as source IP address,
      while uses a Code value of 1 when it processes an FBU whose source
      IP address is not PCoA.  A new Code value of 2 is used for
      dedicated prefix request.  Dedicated Prefix Option defined in
      Section 5.3 MAY be included.  NAR allocates dedicated prefix based
      on the prefix preference in the option.  If the option is not
      included, NAR allocates prefix according it's discretion.
   o  A new code value of 3 is used by PAR to indicate NAR allocating a
      dedicated prefix for MN, replacing prefix part of the provisional
      NCoA to formulate a modified NCoA, and sending HAck in response in
      Solution 2 or Solution 3.

5.2.  HAck Extension

   Handover Acknowledgment message defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fmipv6-rfc4068bis] is a new ICMPv6 message that
   MUST be sent (typically by NAR to PAR) as a reply to the Handover
   Initiate message.  In this document, HAck is extended to respond to a
   dedicated prefix request.
   o  One new Code value is defined.  Here, a Code value of 6 is used
      for dedicated prefix response.
   o  Dedicated Prefix Option defined in Section 5.3 MUST be included
      for prefix delegation.

5.3.  Dedicated Prefix Option

   This option is of the form shown in Figure 2.

                     Figure 2: Dedicated Prefix Option



      Type       To be assigned by IANA

      Length     The length of the option in units of 8 octets.

      Prefix Length
                 8-bit unsigned integer.  The number of leading bits
                 in the Prefix that are valid.  The value ranges from 0
                 to 128.

      Option-Code
                 1    Dedicated Prefix

      Lifetime   32-bit unsigned integer.  The length of time in seconds
                 (relative to the time the packet is sent).  A value of
                 all one bits (0xffffffff) represents infinity.

      Prefix     An IP address or a prefix of an IP address. MN uses it
                 prefix to formulate NCoA



6.  Security Considerations

   FMIPv6 operation on point-to-point links does not introduce any new
   security threats and the security provided by FMIPv6 applies
   completely.


7.  IANA consideration

   This document extends existing HI/HAck messages, new Code values need
   to be assigned by IANA.

   The document defines one new Mobility Option which needs type
   assignment from the Mobility Options Type registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/mobility-parameters:

   1.  Dedicated Prefix Option described in Section 5.3.
