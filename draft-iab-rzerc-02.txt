1.  Introduction

   The ICANN Root Zone Evolution Review Committee (RZERC) reviews
   proposed architectural changes to the content of the DNS root zone,
   the systems including both hardware and software components used in
   executing changes to the DNS root zone, and the mechanisms used for
   distribution of the DNS root zone, and makes recommendations to the
   ICANN Board.  As stipulated in [RZERC-Charter] the IETF is called
   upon to name its delegate to the committee.

   The IAB will select one person for a one-year term.  This appointment
   can be renewable for up to three additional one-year terms.  This
   memo outlines the process by which the IETF makes that selection.

   In brief, this document describes the timeframe and procedures for
   the IAB to solicit public input and make a selection for the open
   position.

2.  Desirable Qualifications for an IETF-Nominated RZERC Member

   Candidates for the RZERC should have a demonstrable involvement in
   the IETF with a particular focus on active participation in IETF
   Working Groups.

   The candidate is expected to possess clearly demonstrated technical
   competence in Internet technology relating to the DNS root zone, and
   be able to articulate those technology issues such that the ICANN
   Board can be provided with sound technical perspectives.  The
   candidate is also expected to be able to understand the respective
   roles and responsibilities of the IETF and ICANN and be able to
   articulate these roles within both organizational communities.

   The candidate will be a representative or a delegate of the IETF.  It
   is expected that the candidate would be able to call on experts in
   the IETF community as required, to ensure that the ICANN Board
   receives the highest quality technical advice available.

3.  IETF-Nominated RZERC Member Selection Process

3.1.  Term Length

   The IETF appointment to the RZERC will serve a one-year term.  This
   appointment can be renewable for up to three additional one-year
   terms.

   In cases when the incumbent is willing to serve for an additional
   term and has not yet exceeded the term limits described above, the
   IAB may ask the IETF community for feedback on the incumbent to find
   out whether it is necessary to run a full selection process.  If the
   IAB determines that it is not necessary to run a full selection
   process, the incumbent may be re-appointed by the IAB for another
   year.

3.2.  Nominations and Eligibility

   Except in cases when the IAB has decided to re-appoint the incumbent,
   each year, the IAB will make a public call for nominations on the
   ietf-announce@ietf.org mailing list.  The public call will specify
   the manner by which nominations will be accepted and the means by
   which the list of nominees will be published.  The call for
   nominations will also include the expected workload for the position,
   as provided by the current IETF-appointed RZERC member.

   Self-nominations are permitted.  Along with the name and contact
   information for each candidate, details about the candidate's
   background and qualifications for the position should be attached to
   the nomination.  All IETF participants are eligible for nomination.
   While IETF NomCom members, IAB members, IAOC members, and IESG
   members are eligible, the IAB will balance time constraints and
   potential conflicts of interest from those members in its
   consideration of nominees.

   IAB members who accept a nomination will recuse themselves from
   selection discussions.

3.3.  Selection

   The IAB will publish the list of nominated persons, review the
   material, and make a selection.

   The IAB will consider potential conflicts with a position on the
   ICANN RZERC and any other ICANN committees supported by nominated
   candidates.

3.4.  Timeframe

   The IAB expects to seat new RZERC members in time for ICANN's annual
   general meeting in Q4 of each year.  Basic timeframe requirements for
   the IETF process are as follows:

   o  4-6 weeks for solicitation of nominations or review of incumbent

   o  4-6 weeks for review of nominees, deliberation and selection

   In Q2 of each year, the IAB will announce the specific dates for the
   RZERC selection process for that year (taking into account the
   particular dates of IETF and ICANN meetings, etc), following the
   guidelines above.

3.5.  Mid-term Vacancies

   This document describes the process for the general, annual
   appointment of RZERC members to fill the seats of members whose terms
   are ending.  However, if an IETF-appointed member of the RZERC is
   unable to serve his or her full term, the IAB may, at its discretion,
   immediately select a replacement to serve the remainder of the term
   using the interim process defined in Section 3.5.1.  If the IAB does
   not invoke the interim process, the next annual selection process
   will fill the vacancy.

3.5.1.  Interim Appointment Process

   If the IAB elects to fill the mid-term vacancy before the next annual
   selection, a separate timeline will be announced and the rest of the
   process described in this document will be followed.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not describe any technical protocols and has no
   implications for network security.
