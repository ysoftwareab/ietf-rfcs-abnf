1.  Fostering Code Reuse with New Elliptic Curves

   It is well-known that elliptic curves can be represented using
   different curve models.  Recently, IETF standardized elliptic curves
   that are claimed to have better performance and improved robustness
   against "real world" attacks than curves represented in the
   traditional "short" Weierstrass model.  This document specifies an
   alternative representation of points of Curve25519, a so-called
   Montgomery curve, and of points of Edwards25519, a so-called twisted
   Edwards curve, which are both specified in [RFC7748], as points of a
   specific so-called "short" Weierstrass curve, called Wei25519.  We
   also define how to efficiently switch between these different
   representations.

   Use of Wei25519 allows easy definition of new signature schemes and
   key agreement schemes already specified for traditional NIST prime
   curves, thereby allowing easy integration with existing
   specifications, such as NIST SP 800-56a [SP-800-56a], FIPS Pub 186-4
   [FIPS-186-4], and ANSI X9.62-2005 [ANSI-X9.62], and fostering code
   reuse on platforms that already implement some of these schemes using
   elliptic curve arithmetic for curves in "short" Weierstrass form (see
   Appendix C.1).

2.  Specification of Wei25519

   For the specification of Wei25519 and its relationship to Curve25519
   and Edwards25519, see Appendix E.  For further details and background
   information on elliptic curves, we refer to the other appendices.

   The use of Wei25519 allows reuse of existing generic code that
   implements short-Weierstrass curves, such as the NIST curve P256, to
   also implement the CFRG curves Curve25519 and Edwards25519.  We also
   cater to reusing of existing code where some domain parameters may



Struik                    Expires May 10, 2019                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         lwig-curve-representations          November 2018


   have been hardcoded, thereby widening the scope of applicability.  To
   this end, we specify the short-Weierstrass curves Wei25519.2 and
   Wei25519.-3, with hardcoded domain parameter a=2 and a=-3 (mod p),
   respectively; see Appendix G.

3.  Use of Representation Switches

   The curves Curve25519, Edwards25519, and Wei25519, as specified in
   Appendix E.3, are all isomorphic, with the transformations of
   Appendix E.2.  These transformations map the specified base point of
   each of these curves to the specified base point of each of the other
   curves.  Consequently, a public-key pair (k,R:=k*G) for any one of
   these curves corresponds, via these isomorphic mappings, to the
   public-key pair (k, R':=k*G') for each of these other curves (where G
   and G' are the corresponding base points of these curves).  This
   observation extends to the case where one also considers curve
   Wei25519.2 (which has hardcoded domain parameter a=2), as specified
   in Appendix G.3, since it is isomorphic to Wei25519, with the
   transformation of Appendix G.2, and, thereby, also isomorphic to
   Curve25519 and Edwards25519.

   The curve Wei25519.-3 (which has hardcoded domain parameter a=-3 (mod
   p)) is not isomorphic to the curve Wei25519, but is related in a
   slightly weaker sense: the curve Wei25519 is isogenous to the curve
   Wei25519.-3, where the mapping of Appendix G.2 is an isogeny of
   degree l=47 that maps the specified base point G of Wei25519 to the
   specified base point G' of Wei25519.-3 and where the so-called dual
   isogeny (which maps Wei25519.-3 to Wei25519) has the same degree
   l=47, but does not map G' to G, but to a fixed multiple hereof, where
   this multiple is l=47.  Consequently, a public-key pair (k,R:=k*G)
   for Wei25519 corresponds to the public-key pair (k, R':= k*G') for
   Wei25519.-3 (via the l-isogeny), whereas the public-key pair (k,
   R':=k*G') corresponds to the public-key pair (l*k, l*R=l*k*G) of
   Wei25519 (via the dual isogeny).  (Note the extra scalar l=47 here.)

   Alternative curve representations can, therefore, be used in any
   cryptographic scheme that involves computations on public-private key
   pairs, where implementations may carry out computations on the
   corresponding object for the isomorphic or isogenous curve and
   convert the results back to the original curve (where, in case this
   involves an l-isogeny, one has to take into account the factor l).
   This includes use with elliptic-curve based signature schemes and key
   agreement and key transport schemes.

4.  Examples

4.1.  Implementation of X25519

   RFC 7748 [RFC7748] specifies the use of X25519, a co-factor Diffie-
   Hellman key agreement scheme, with instantiation by the Montgomery
   curve Curve25519.  This key agreement scheme was already specified in
   Section 6.1.2.2 of NIST SP 800-56a [SP-800-56a] for elliptic curves
   in short Weierstrass form.  Hence, one can implement X25519 using
   existing NIST routines by (1) representing a point of the Montgomery
   curve Curve25519 as a point of the Weierstrass curve Wei25519; (2)
   instantiating the co-factor Diffie-Hellman key agreement scheme of
   the NIST specification with the resulting point and Wei25519 domain
   parameters; (3) representing the key resulting from this scheme
   (which is a point of the curve Wei25519 in Weierstrass form) as a
   point of the Montgomery curve Curve25519.  The representation change
   can be implemented via a simple wrapper and involves a single modular
   addition (see Appendix D.2).  Using this method has the additional
   advantage that one can reuse the public-private key pair routines,
   domain parameter validation, and other checks that are already part
   of the NIST specifications.  Note: at this point, it is unclear
   whether this implies that a FIPS-accredited module implementing co-
   factor Diffie-Hellman for, e.g., P-256 would also extend this
   accreditation to X25519.

4.2.  Implementation of Ed25519

   RFC 8032 [RFC8032] specifies Ed25519, a "full" Schnorr signature
   scheme, with instantiation by the twisted Edwards curve Edwards25519.
   One can implement the computation of the ephemeral key pair for
   Ed25519 using an existing Montgomery curve implementation by (1)
   generating a public-private key pair (k, R':=k*G') for Curve25519;
   (2) representing this public-private key as the pair (k, R:=k*G) for
   Ed25519.  As before, the representation change can be implemented via
   a simple wrapper.  Note that the Montgomery ladder specified in
   Section 5 of RFC7748 [RFC7748] does not provide sufficient
   information to reconstruct R' (since it does not compute the
   y-coordinate of R').  However, this deficiency can be remedied by
   using a slightly modified version of the Montgomery ladder that
   includes reconstruction of the y-coordinate of R':=k*G' at the end of
   hereof (which uses the v-coordinate Gv of the base point of
   Curve25519 as well).  For details, see Appendix D.2.

4.3.  Specification of ECDSA-SHA256-Wei25519

   FIPS Pub 186-4 [FIPS-186-4] specifies the signature scheme ECDSA and
   can be instantiated not just with the NIST prime curves, but also
   with other Weierstrass curves (that satisfy additional cryptographic



Struik                    Expires May 10, 2019                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         lwig-curve-representations          November 2018


   criteria).  In particular, one can instantiate this scheme with the
   Weierstrass curve Wei25519 and the hash function SHA-256, where an
   implementation may generate a public-private key pair for Wei25519 by
   (1) internally carrying out these computations on the Montgomery
   curve Curve25519, the twisted Edwards curve Edwards25519, or even the
   Weierstrass curve Wei25519.-3 (with hardcoded a=-3 domain parameter);
   (2) representing the result as a key pair for the curve Wei25519.
   Note that, in either case, one can implement these schemes with the
   same representation conventions as used with existing NIST
   specifications, including bit/byte-ordering, compression functions,
   and the-like.  This allows implementations of ECDSA with the hash
   function SHA-256 and with the NIST curve P-256 or with the curve
   Wei25519 specified in this draft to use the same implementation
   (instantiated with, respectively, the NIST P-256 elliptic curve
   domain parameters or with the domain parameters of curve Wei25519
   specified in Appendix E).

4.4.  Other Uses

   Any existing specification of cryptographic schemes using elliptic
   curves in Weierstrass form and that allows introduction of a new
   elliptic curve (here: Wei25519) is amenable to similar constructs,
   thus spawning "offspring" protocols, simply by instantiating these
   using the new curve in "short" Weierstrass form, thereby allowing
   code and/or specifications reuse and, for implementations that so
   desire, carrying out curve computations "under the hood" on
   Montgomery curve and twisted Edwards curve cousins hereof (where
   these exist).  This would simply require definition of a new object
   identifier for any such envisioned "offspring" protocol.  This could
   significantly simplify standardization of schemes and help keeping
   the resource and maintenance cost of implementations supporting
   algorithm agility [RFC7696] at bay.

5.  Caveats

   The examples above illustrate how specifying the Weierstrass curve
   Wei25519 may facilitate reuse of existing code and may simplify
   standards development.  However, the following caveats apply:

   1.  Unfriendly wire formats.  The transformations between alternative
       curve representations can be implemented at negligible relative
       incremental cost if the curve points are represented as affine
       points.  If a point is represented in compressed format,
       conversion usually requires a costly point decompression step.
       This is the case in [RFC7748], where the inputs to the co-factor
       Diffie-Hellman scheme X25519, as well as its output, are
       represented in x-coordinate-only format;

Internet-Draft         lwig-curve-representations          November 2018


   2.  Unfriendly representation conventions.  While elliptic curve
       computations are carried-out in a field GF(q) and, thereby,
       involve large integer arithmetic, these integers are represented
       as bit- and byte-strings.  Here, [RFC8032] uses least-
       significant-byte (LSB)/least-significant-bit (lsb) conventions,
       whereas [RFC7748] uses LSB/most-significant-bit (msb)
       conventions, and where most other cryptographic specifications,
       including NIST SP800-56a [SP-800-56a], FIPS Pub 186-4
       [FIPS-186-4], and ANSI X9.62-2005 [ANSI-X9.62] use MSB/msb
       conventions.  Since each pair of conventions is different, this
       does necessitate bit/byte representation conversions;

   3.  Unfriendly domain parameters.  All traditional NIST curves are
       Weierstrass curve with domain parameter a=-3, while all Brainpool
       curves [RFC5639] are isomorphic to a Weierstrass curve of this
       form.  Thus, one can expect there to be existing Weierstrass
       implementations with a hardcoded a=-3 domain parameter
       ("Jacobian-friendly").  For those implementations, including the
       curve Wei25519 as a potential vehicle for offering support for
       the CFRG curves Curve25519 and Edwards25519 is not possible,
       since not of the required form.  Instead, one has to implement
       Curve25519.-3 and include code that implements the isogeny and
       dual isogeny from and to Wei25519.  This isogeny has degree l=47
       and requires roughly 9kB of storage for isogeny and dual-isogeny
       computations (see the tables in Appendix H).  Note that storage
       would have reduced to a single 32-bye table if the curve would
       have been generated so as to be isomorphic to a Weierstrass curve
       with hardcoded a=-3 parameter (this corresponds to l=1).  Note:
       an example of such a curve is the Montgomery curve M_{A,B} over
       GF(p) with p=2^255-19, A=-1410290, and B=1 or (if one wants the
       base point to still have u-coordinate u=9) A=-3960846.  In either
       case, the resulting curve has the same cryptographic properties
       as Curve25519, while being more "Jacobian-friendly".

6.  Security Considerations

   The different representations of elliptic curve points discussed in
   this document are all obtained using a publicly known transformation,
   which is either an isomorphism or a low-degree isogeny.  It is well-
   known that an isomorphism maps elliptic curve points to equivalent
   mathematical objects and that the complexity of cryptographic
   problems (such as the discrete logarithm problem) of curves related
   via a low-degree isogeny are tightly related.  Thus, the use of these
   techniques does not negatively impact cryptographic security.

   As to implementation security, reusing existing high-quality code or
   generic implementations that have been carefully designed to
   withstand implementation attacks for one curve model may allow a more

Internet-Draft         lwig-curve-representations          November 2018


   economical way of development and maintenance than providing this
   same functionality for each curve model separately (if multiple curve
   models need to be supported) and, otherwise, may allow a more gradual
   migration path, where one may initially use existing and accredited
   chipsets that cater to the pre-dominant curve model used in practice
   for over 15 years.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   The transformations between different curve models described in this
   document are publicly known and, therefore, do not affect privacy
   provisions.

8.  IANA Considerations

   There is *currently* no IANA action required for this document.  New
   object identifiers would be required in case one wishes to specify
   one or more of the "offspring" protocols exemplified in Section 4.

Appendix A.  Some (non-Binary) Elliptic Curves

A.1.  Curves in short-Weierstrass Form

   Let GF(q) denote the finite field with q elements, where q is an odd
   prime power and where q is not divisible by three.  Let W_{a,b} be
   the Weierstrass curve with defining equation y^2 = x^3 + a*x + b,
   where a and b are elements of GF(q) and where 4*a^3 + 27*b^2 is
   nonzero.  The points of W_{a,b} are the ordered pairs (x, y) whose
   coordinates are elements of GF(q) and that satisfy the defining
   equation (the so-called affine points), together with the special
   point O (the so-called "point at infinity").This set forms a group
   under addition, via the so-called "secant-and-tangent" rule, where
   the point at infinity serves as the identity element.  See
   Appendix C.1 for details of the group operation.

A.2.  Montgomery Curves

   Let GF(q) denote the finite field with q elements, where q is an odd
   prime power.  Let M_{A,B} be the Montgomery curve with defining
   equation B*v^2 = u^3 + A*u^2 + u, where A and B are elements of GF(q)
   with A unequal to (+/-)2 and with B nonzero.  The points of M_{A,B}
   are the ordered pairs (u, v) whose coordinates are elements of GF(q)
   and that satisfy the defining equation (the so-called affine points),
   together with the special point O (the so-called "point at
   infinity").This set forms a group under addition, via the so-called
   "secant-and-tangent" rule, where the point at infinity serves as the
   identity element.  See Appendix C.2 for details of the group
   operation.

A.3.  Twisted Edwards Curves

   Let GF(q) denote the finite field with q elements, where q is an odd
   prime power.  Let E_{a,d} be the twisted Edwards curve with defining
   equation a*x^2 + y^2 = 1+ d*x^2*y^2, where a and d are distinct
   nonzero elements of GF(q).  The points of E_{a,d} are the ordered
   pairs (x, y) whose coordinates are elements of GF(q) and that satisfy
   the defining equation (the so-called affine points).  It can be shown
   that this set forms a group under addition if a is a square in GF(q),
   whereas d is not, where the point (0, 1) serves as the identity
   element.  (Note that the identity element satisfies the defining
   equation.)  See Appendix C.3 for details of the group operation.

   An Edwards curve is a twisted Edwards curve with a=1.

Appendix B.  Elliptic Curve Nomenclature

   Each curve defined in Appendix A forms a commutative group under
   addition.  In Appendix C we specify the group laws, which depend on
   the curve model in question.  For completeness, we here include some
   common elliptic curve nomenclature and basic properties (primarily so
   as to keep this document self-contained).  These notions are mainly
   used in Appendix E and Appendix G and not essential for our
   exposition.  This section can be skipped at first reading.

   Any point P of a curve is a generator of the cyclic subgroup
   (P):={k*P | k = 0, 1, 2,...} of the curve.  If (P) has cardinality l,
   then l is called the order of P.  The order of a curve is the
   cardinality of the set of its points.  A curve is cyclic if it is
   generated by some point of this curve.  All curves of prime order are
   cyclic, while all curves of order |E| = h*n, where n is a large prime
   number and where h is a small number (the so-called co-factor), have
   a large cyclic subgroup of prime order n.  In this case, a generator
   of order n is called a base point, commonly denoted by G.  A point of
   order dividing h is said to be in the small subgroup.  For curves of
   prime order, this small subgroup is the singleton set, consisting of
   only the identity element.

   If R is a point on a curve E that is also contained in (P), there is
   a unique integer k in the interval [0, l-1] so that R=kP, where l is
   the order of P.  This number is called the discrete logarithm of R to
   the base P.  The discrete logarithm problem is the problem of finding
   the discrete logarithm of R to the base P for any two points P and R
   of the curve, if such a number exists.

   A public-private key pair is an ordered pair (k, R:=kG), where G is a
   fixed base point of the curve.  Here, k (the private key) is an
   integer in the interval [0,n-1], where G has order n.

   A quadratic twist of a curve E defined over a field GF(q) is a curve
   E' related to E, with cardinality |E|+|E'|=2*(q+1).  If E is a curve
   in one of the curve models specified in this document, a quadratic
   twist of this curve can be expressed using the same curve model,
   although (naturally) with different curve parameters.

Appendix C.  Elliptic Curve Group Operations

C.1.  Group Law for Weierstrass Curves

   For each point P of the Weierstrass curve W_{a,b}, the point at
   infinity O serves as identity element, i.e., P + O = O + P = P.





Struik                    Expires May 10, 2019                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft         lwig-curve-representations          November 2018


   For each affine point P:=(x, y) of the Weierstrass curve W_{a,b}, the
   point -P is the point (x, -y) and one has P + (-P) = O.

   Let P1:=(x1, y1) and P2:=(x2, y2) be distinct affine points of the
   Weierstrass curve W_{a,b} and let Q:=P1 + P2, where Q is not the
   identity element.  Then Q:=(x, y), where

       x + x1 + x2 = lambda^2 and y + y1 = lambda*(x1 - x), where lambda
       = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1).

   Let P:= (x1, y1) be an affine point of the Weierstrass curve W_{a,b}
   and let Q:=2*P, where Q is not the identity element.  Then Q:= (x,
   y), where

       x + 2*x1 = lambda^2 and y + y1 = lambda*(x1 - x), where
       lambda=(3*x1^2 + a)/(2*y1).

   From the group law above it follows that if P=(x, y), P1=k*P=(x1,
   y1), and P2=(k+1)*P=(x2, y2) are affine points of the Weierstrass
   curve W_{a,b} and if y is nonzero, then the y-coordinate of P1 can be
   expressed in terms of the x-coordinates of P, P1, and P2, and the
   y-coordinate of P, as

       y1=((x*x1+a)*(x+x1)+2*b-x2*(x-x1)^2)/(2*y).

   This property allows recovery of the y-coordinate of a point P1=k*P
   that is computed via the so-called Montgomery ladder, where P is an
   affine point with nonzero y-coordinate.  Further details are out of
   scope.

C.2.  Group Law for Montgomery Curves

   For each point P of the Montgomery curve M_{A,B}, the point at
   infinity O serves as identity element, i.e., P + O = O + P = P.

   For each affine point P:=(x, y) of the Montgomery curve M_{A,B}, the
   point -P is the point (x, -y) and one has P + (-P) = O.

   Let P1:=(x1, y1) and P2:=(x2, y2) be distinct affine points of the
   Montgomery curve M_{A,B} and let Q:=P1 + P2, where Q is not the
   identity element.  Then Q:=(x, y), where

       x + x1 + x2 = B*lambda^2 - A and y + y1 = lambda*(x1 - x), where
       lambda=(y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1).

   Let P:= (x1, y1) be an affine point of the Montgomery curve M_{A,B}
   and let Q:=2*P, where Q is not the identity element.  Then Q:= (x,
   y), where

       x + 2*x1 = B*lambda^2 - A and y + y1 = lambda*(x1 - x), where
       lambda=(3*x1^2 + 2*A*x1+1)/(2*B*y1).

   From the group law above it follows that if P=(x, y), P1=k*P=(x1,
   y1), and P2=(k+1)*P=(x2, y2) are affine points of the Montgomery
   curve M_{A,B} and if y is nonzero, then the y-coordinate of P1 can be
   expressed in terms of the x-coordinates of P, P1, and P2, and the
   y-coordinate of P, as

       y1=((x*x1+1)*(x+x1+2*A)-2*A-x2*(x-x1)^2)/(2*B*y).

   This property allows recovery of the y-coordinate of a point P1=k*P
   that is computed via the so-called Montgomery ladder, where P is an
   affine point with nonzero y-coordinate.  Further details are out of
   scope.

C.3.  Group Law for Twisted Edwards Curves

   Note: The group laws below hold for twisted Edwards curves E_{a,d}
   where a is a square in GF(q), whereas d is not.  In this case, the
   addition formulae below are defined for each pair of points, without
   exceptions.  Generalizations of this group law to other twisted
   Edwards curves are out of scope.

   For each point P of the twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d}, the point
   O=(0,1) serves as identity element, i.e., P + O = O + P = P.

   For each point P:=(x, y) of the twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d}, the
   point -P is the point (-x, y) and one has P + (-P) = O.

   Let P1:=(x1, y1) and P2:=(x2, y2) be points of the twisted Edwards
   curve E_{a,d} and let Q:=P1 + P2.  Then Q:=(x, y), where

       x = (x1*y2 + x2*y1)/(1 + d*x1*x2*y1*y2) and y = (y1*y2 -
       a*x1*x2)/(1 - d*x1*x2*y1*y2).

   Let P:=(x1, y1) be a point of the twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d} and
   let Q:=2*P.  Then Q:=(x, y), where

       x = (2*x1*y1)/(1 + d*x1^2*y1^2) and y = (y1^2 - a*x1^2)/(1 -
       d*x1^2*y1^2).

   Note that one can use the formulae for point addition for
   implementing point doubling, taking inverses and adding the identity
   element as well (i.e., the point addition formulae are uniform and
   complete (subject to our Note above)).

Appendix D.  Relationship Between Curve Models

   The non-binary curves specified in Appendix A are expressed in
   different curve models, viz. as curves in short-Weierstrass form, as
   Montgomery curves, or as twisted Edwards curves.  These curve models
   are related, as follows.

D.1.  Mapping between twisted Edwards Curves and Montgomery Curves

   One can map points of the Montgomery curve M_{A,B} to points of the
   twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d}, where a:=(A+2)/B and d:=(A-2)/B and,
   conversely, map points of the twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d} to points
   of the Montgomery curve M_{A,B}, where A:=2(a+d)/(a-d) and where
   B:=4/(a-d).  For twisted Edwards curves we consider (i.e., those
   where a is a square in GF(q), whereas d is not), this defines a one-
   to-one correspondence, which - in fact - is an isomorphism between
   M_{A,B} and E_{a,d}, thereby showing that, e.g., the discrete
   logarithm problem in either curve model is equally hard.

   For the Montgomery curves and twisted Edwards curves we consider, the
   mapping from M_{A,B} to E_{a,d} is defined by mapping the point at
   infinity O and the point (0, 0) of order two of M_{A,B} to,
   respectively, the point (0, 1) and the point (0, -1) of order two of
   E_{a,d}, while mapping each other point (u, v) of M_{A,B} to the
   point (x, y):=(u/v, (u-1)/(u+1)) of E_{a,d}. The inverse mapping from
   E_{a,d} to M_{A,B} is defined by mapping the point (0, 1) and the
   point (0, -1) of order two of E_{a,d} to, respectively, the point at
   infinity O and the point (0, 0) of order two of M_{A,B}, while each
   other point (x, y) of E_{a,d} is mapped to the point (u,
   v):=((1+y)/(1-y), (1+y)/((1-y)*x)) of M_{A,B}.

   Implementations may take advantage of this mapping to carry out
   elliptic curve group operations originally defined for a twisted
   Edwards curve on the corresponding Montgomery curve, or vice-versa,
   and translating the result back to the original curve, thereby
   potentially allowing code reuse.

D.2.  Mapping between Montgomery Curves and Weierstrass Curves

   One can map points of the Montgomery curve M_{A,B} to points of the
   Weierstrass curve W_{a,b}, where a:=(3-A^2)/(3*B^2) and
   b:=(2*A^3-9*A)/(27*B^3).  This defines a one-to-one correspondence,
   which - in fact - is an isomorphism between M_{A,B} and W_{a,b},
   thereby showing that, e.g., the discrete logarithm problem in either
   curve model is equally hard.

   The mapping from M_{A,B} to W_{a,b} is defined by mapping the point
   at infinity O of M_{A,B} to the point at infinity O of W_{a,b}, while



Struik                    Expires May 10, 2019                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         lwig-curve-representations          November 2018


   mapping each other point (u, v) of M_{A,B} to the point (x, y):=(u/
   B+A/(3*B), v/B) of W_{a,b}. Note that not all Weierstrass curves can
   be injectively mapped to Montgomery curves, since the latter have a
   point of order two and the former may not.  In particular, if a
   Weierstrass curve has prime order, such as is the case with the so-
   called "NIST curves", this inverse mapping is not defined.

   This mapping can be used to implement elliptic curve group operations
   originally defined for a twisted Edwards curve or for a Montgomery
   curve using group operations on the corresponding elliptic curve in
   short-Weierstrass form and translating the result back to the
   original curve, thereby potentially allowing code reuse.

   Note that implementations for elliptic curves with short-Weierstrass
   form that hard-code the domain parameter a to a= -3 (which value is
   known to allow more efficient implementations) cannot always be used
   this way, since the curve W_{a,b} resulting from an isomorphic
   mapping cannot always be expressed as a Weierstrass curve with a=-3
   via a coordinate transformation.  For more details, see Appendix F.

D.3.  Mapping between twisted Edwards Curves and Weierstrass Curves

   One can map points of the twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d} to points of
   the Weierstrass curve W_{a,b}, via function composition, where one
   uses the isomorphic mapping between twisted Edwards curve and
   Montgomery curves of Appendix D.1 and the one between Montgomery and
   Weierstrass curves of Appendix D.2.  Obviously, one can use function
   composition (now using the respective inverses) to realize the
   inverse of this mapping.

Appendix E.  Curve25519 and Cousins

E.1.  Curve Definition and Alternative Representations

   The elliptic curve Curve25519 is the Montgomery curve M_{A,B} defined
   over the prime field GF(p), with p:=2^{255}-19, where A:=486662 and
   B:=1.  This curve has order h*n, where h=8 and where n is a prime
   number.  For this curve, A^2-4 is not a square in GF(p), whereas A+2
   is.  The quadratic twist of this curve has order h1*n1, where h1=4
   and where n1 is a prime number.  For this curve, the base point is
   the point (Gu,Gv), where Gu=9 and where Gv is an odd integer in the
   interval [0, p-1].

   This curve has the same group structure as (is "isomorphic" to) the
   twisted Edwards curve E_{a,d} defined over GF(p), with as base point
   the point (Gx,Gy), where parameters are as specified in Appendix E.3.
   This curve is denoted as Edwards25519.  For this curve, the parameter

Internet-Draft         lwig-curve-representations          November 2018


   a is a square in GF(p), whereas d is not, so the group laws of
   Appendix C.3 apply.

   The curve is also isomorphic to the elliptic curve W_{a,b} in short-
   Weierstrass form defined over GF(p), with as base point the point
   (Gx',Gy'), where parameters are as specified in Appendix E.3.  This
   curve is denoted as Wei25519.

E.2.  Switching between Alternative Representations

   Each affine point (u,v) of Curve25519 corresponds to the point
   (x,y):=(u + A/3,y) of Wei25519, while the point at infinity of
   Curve25519 corresponds to the point at infinity of Wei25519.  (Here,
   we used the mapping of Appendix D.2.)  Under this mapping, the base
   point (Gu,Gv) of Curve25519 corresponds to the base point (Gx',Gy')
   of Wei25519.  The inverse mapping maps the affine point (x,y) of
   Wei25519 to (u,v):=(x - A/3,y) of Curve25519, while mapping the point
   at infinity of Wei25519 to the point at infinity of Curve25519.  Note
   that this mapping involves a simple shift of the first coordinate and
   can be implemented via integer-only arithmetic as a shift of (p+A)/3
   for the isomorphic mapping and a shift of -(p+A)/3 for its inverse,
   where delta=(p+A)/3 is the element of GF(p) defined by

   delta  19298681539552699237261830834781317975544997444273427339909597

       (=0x2aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad2
       451)

   The curve Edwards25519 is isomorphic to the curve Curve25519, where
   the base point (Gu,Gv) of Curve25519 corresponds to the base point
   (Gx,Gy) of Edwards25519 and where the point at infinity and the point
   (0,0) of order two of Curve25519 correspond to, respectively, the
   point (0, 1) and the point (0, -1) of order two of Edwards25519 and
   where each other point (u, v) of Curve25519 corresponds to the point
   (c*u/v, (u-1)/(u+1)) of Edwards25519, where c is the element of GF(p)
   defined by

   c   sqrt(-(A+2))

       3391fb55 00ba81e7)

   (Here, we used the mapping of Appendix D.1.)  The inverse mapping
   from Edwards25519 to Curve25519 is defined by mapping the point (0,

   1) and the point (0, -1) of order two of Edwards25519 to,
   respectively, the point at infinity and the point (0,0) of order two
   of Curve25519 and having each other point (x, y) of Edwards25519
   correspond to the point ((1 + y)/(1 - y), c*(1 + y)/((1-y)*x)).

   The curve Edwards25519 is isomorphic to the Weierstrass curve
   Wei25519, where the base point (Gx,Gy) of Edwards25519 corresponds to
   the base point (Gx',Gy') of Wei25519 and where the identity element
   (0,1) and the point (0,-1) of order two of Edwards25519 correspond
   to, respectively, the point at infinity O and the point (A/3, 0) of
   order two of Wei25519 and where each other point (x, y) of
   Edwards25519 corresponds to the point (x', y'):=((1+y)/(1-y)+A/3,
   c*(1+y)/((1-y)*x)) of Wei25519, where c was defined before.  (Here,
   we used the mapping of Appendix D.3.)  The inverse mapping from
   Wei25519 to Edwards25519 is defined by mapping the point at infinity
   O and the point (A/3, 0) of order two of Wei25519 to, respectively,
   the identity element (0,1) and the point (0,-1) of order two of
   Edwards25519 and having each other point (x, y) of Wei25519
   correspond to the point (c*(3*x-A)/(3*y), (3*x-A-3)/(3*x-A+3)).

   Note that these mappings can be easily realized in projective
   coordinates, using a few field multiplications only, thus allowing
   switching between alternative representations with negligible
   relative incremental cost.

E.3.  Domain Parameters

   The parameters of the Montgomery curve and the corresponding
   isomorphic curves in twisted Edwards curve and short-Weierstrass form
   are as indicated below.  Here, the domain parameters of the

Appendix F.  Further Mappings

   The non-binary curves specified in Appendix A are expressed in
   different curve models, viz. as curves in short-Weierstrass form, as
   Montgomery curves, or as twisted Edwards curves.  Within each curve
   model, further mappings exist that induce a mapping between elliptic
   curves within each curve model.  This can be exploited to force some
   of the domain parameters to a value that allows a more efficient
   implementation of the addition formulae.

F.1.  Isomorphic Mapping between Weierstrass Curves

   One can map points of the Weierstrass curve W_{a,b} to points of the
   Weierstrass curve W_{a',b'}, where a:=a'*s^4 and b:=b'*s^6 for some
   nonzero value s of the finite field GF(q).  This defines a one-to-one
   correspondence, which - in fact - is an isomorphism between W_{a,b}
   and W_{a',b'}, thereby showing that, e.g., the discrete logarithm
   problem in either curve model is equally hard.

   The mapping from W_{a,b} to W_{a',b'} is defined by mapping the point
   at infinity O of W_{a,b} to the point at infinity O of W_{a',b'},
   while mapping each other point (x, y) of W_{a,b} to the point (x',
   y'):=(x*s^2, y*s^3) of W_{a',b'}. The inverse mapping from W_{a',b'}
   to W_{a,b} is defined by mapping the point at infinity O of W_{a',b'}

   to the point at infinity O of W_{a,b}, while mapping each other point
   (x', y') of W_{a',b'} to the point (x, y):=(x/s^2, y/s^3) of W_{a,b}.

   Implementations may take advantage of this mapping to carry out
   elliptic curve group operations originally defined for a Weierstrass
   curve with a generic domain parameter a on a corresponding isomorphic
   Weierstrass curve with domain parameter a' that has a special form,
   which is known to allow for more efficient implementations of
   addition laws, and translating the result back to the original curve.
   In particular, it is known that such efficiency improvements exist if
   a'=-3 (mod p) and one uses so-called Jacobian coordinates with a
   particular projective version of the addition laws of Appendix C.1.
   While not all Weierstrass curves can be put into this form, all
   traditional NIST curves have domain parameter a=-3, while all
   Brainpool curves [RFC5639] are isomorphic to a Weierstrass curve of
   this form.

   Note that implementations for elliptic curves with short-Weierstrass
   form that hard-code the domain parameter a to a= -3 cannot always be
   used this way, since the curve W_{a,b} cannot always be expressed in
   terms of a Weierstrass curve with a'=-3 via a coordinate
   transformation: this only holds if a'/a is a fourth power in GF(q)
   (see Section 3.1.5 of [GECC]).  However, even in this case, one can
   still express the curve W_{a,b} as a Weierstrass curve with a small
   domain parameter value a', thereby still allowing a more efficient
   implementation than with a general domain parameter value a.

F.2.  Isogenous Mapping between Weierstrass Curves

   One can still map points of the Weierstrass curve W_{a,b} to points
   of the Weierstrass curve W_{a',b'}, where a':=-3 (mod p), even if
   a'/a is not a fourth power in GF(q).  In that case, this mappping
   cannot be an isomorphism (see Appendix F.1).  Instead, the mapping is
   a so-called isogeny (or homomorphism).  Since most elliptic curve
   operations process points of prime order or use so-called "co-factor
   multiplication", in practice the resulting mapping has similar
   properties as an isomorphism.  In particular, one can still take
   advantage of this mapping to carry out elliptic curve group
   operations originally defined for a Weierstrass curve with domain
   parameter a unequal to -3 (mod p) on a corresponding isogenous
   Weierstrass curve with domain parameter a'=-3 (mod p) and translating
   the result back to the original curve.

   In this case, the mapping from W_{a,b} to W_{a',b'} is defined by
   mapping the point at infinity O of W_{a,b} to the point at infinity O
   of W_{a',b'}, while mapping each other point (x, y) of W_{a,b} to the
   point (x', y'):=(u(x)/w(x)^2, y*v(x)/w(x)^3) of W_{a',b'}. Here,
   u(x), v(x), and w(x) are polynomials that depend on the isogeny in

   question.  The inverse mapping from W_{a',b'} to W_{a,b} is again an
   isogeny and defined by mapping the point at infinity O of W_{a',b'}
   to the point at infinity O of W_{a,b}, while mapping each other point
   (x', y') of W_{a',b'} to the point (x, y):=(u'(x')/w'(x')^2,
   y'*v'(x')/w'(x')^3) of W_{a,b}, where -- again -- u'(x'), v'(x'), and
   w'(x') are polynomials that depend on the isogeny in question.  These
   mappings have the property that their composition is not the identity
   mapping (as is the case with the isomorphic mappings discussed in
   Appendix F.1), but rather a fixed multiple hereof: if this multiple
   is l then the isogeny is called an isogeny of degree l (or l-isogeny)
   and u, v, and w (and, similarly, u', v', and w') are polynomials of
   degrees l, 3(l-1)/2, and (l-1)/2, respectively.  Note that an
   isomorphism is simply an isogeny of degree l=1.  Details of how to
   determine isogenies are outside scope of this document (for this,
   contact the author of this document).

   Implementations may take advantage of this mapping to carry out
   elliptic curve group operations originally defined for a Weierstrass
   curve with a generic domain parameter a on a corresponding isogenous
   Weierstrass curve with domain parameter a'=-3 (mod p), where one can
   use so-called Jacobian coordinates with a particular projective
   version of the addition laws of Appendix C.1.  Since all traditional
   NIST curves have domain parameter a=-3, while all Brainpool curves
   [RFC5639] are isomorphic to a Weierstrass curve of this form, this
   allows taking advantage of existing implementations for these curves
   that may have a hardcoded a=-3 (mod p) domain parameter, provided one
   switches back and forth to this curve form using the isogenous
   mapping in question.

   Note that isogenous mappings can be easily realized in projective
   coordinates and involves roughly 3*l finite field multiplications,
   thus allowing switching between alternative representations at
   relative low incremental cost compared to that of elliptic curve
   scalar multiplications (provided the isogeny has low degree l).
   Note, however, that this does require storage of the polynomial
   coefficients of the isogeny and dual isogeny involved.  This
   illustrates that low-degree isogenies are to be preferred, since an
   l-isogeny (usually) requires storing roughly 6*l elements of GF(q).
   While there are many isogenies, we therefore only consider those with
   the desired property with lowest possible degree.

Appendix G.  Further Cousins of Curve25519

G.1.  Further Alternative Representations

   The Weierstrass curve Wei25519 is isomorphic to the Weierstrass curve
   Wei25519.2 defined over GF(p), with as base point the pair
   (G1x',G1y'), and isogenous to the Weierstrass curve Wei25519.-3

   defined over GF(p), with as base point the pair (G2x', G2y'), where
   parameters are as specified in Appendix G.3 and where the related
   mappings are as specified in Appendix G.2.

G.2.  Further Switching

   Each affine point (x,y) of Wei25519 corresponds to the point
   (x',y'):=(x*s^2,y*s^3) of Wei25519.2, where s is the element of GF(p)
   defined by

   while the point at infinity of Wei25519 corresponds to the point at
   infinity of Wei25519.2.  (Here, we used the mapping of Appendix F.1.)
   Under this mapping, the base point (Gx',Gy') of Wei25519 corresponds
   to the base point (G1x',G1y') of Wei25519.2.  The inverse mapping
   maps the affine point (x',y') of Wei25519.2 to (x,y):=(x'/s^2,y'/s^3)
   of Wei25519, while mapping the point at infinity of Wei25519.2 to the
   point at infinity of Wei25519.  Note that this mapping (and its
   inverse) involves a modular multiplication of both coordinates with
   fixed constants s^2 and s^3 (respectively, 1/s^2 and 1/s^3), which
   can be precomputed.

   Each affine point (x,y) of Wei25519 corresponds to the point
   (x',y'):=(x1/t^2,y1/t^3) of Wei25519.-3, where
   (x1,y1)=(u(x)/w(x)^2,y*v(x)/w(x)^3), where u, v, and w are the
   polynomials with coefficients in GF(p) as defined in Appendix H.1 and
   where t is the element of GF(p) defined by

   while the point at infinity of Wei25519 corresponds to the point at
   infinity of Wei25519.-3.  (Here, we used the isogenous mapping of
   Appendix F.2.)  Under this isogenous mapping, the base point
   (Gx',Gy') of Wei25519 corresponds to the base point (G2x',G2y') of
   Wei25519.-3.  The dual isogeny maps the affine point (x',y') of
   Wei25519.-3 to to (x,y):=(u'(x1)/w'(x1)^2,y1*v'(x1)/w'(x1)^3) of
   Wei25519, where (x1,y1)=(x'*t^2,y'*t^3) and where u', v', and w' are
   the polynomials with coefficients in GF(p) as defined in
   Appendix H.2, while mapping the point at infinity of Wei25519.-3 to

   the point at infinity of Wei25519.  Under this dual isogenous
   mapping, the base point (G2x',G2y') of Wei25519.-3 corresponds to a
   multiple of the base point (Gx',Gy') of Wei25519, where this multiple
   is l=47 (the degree of the isogeny; see the description in
   Appendix F.1).  Note that this isogenous map (and its dual) primarily
   involves the evaluation of three fixed polynomials involving the
   x-coordinate, which takes roughly 140 modular multiplications (or
   less than 5-10% relative incremental cost compared to the cost of an
   elliptic curve scalar multiplication).

G.3.  Further Domain Parameters

   The parameters of the Weierstrass curve with a=2 that is isomorphic
   with Wei25519 and the parameters of the Weierstrass curve with a=-3
   that is isogenous with Wei25519 are as indicated below.  Both domain
   parameter sets can be exploited directly to derive more efficient
   point addition formulae, should an implementation facilitate this.

Appendix H.  Isogeny Details

   The isogeny and dual isogeny are both isogenies with degree l=47.
   Both are specified by a triple of polynomials u, v, and w (resp. u',
   v', and w') of degree 47, 69, and 23, respectively, with coefficients
   in GF(p).  The coeffients of each of these polynomials are specified
   in Appendix H.1 (for the isogeny) and in Appendix H.2 (for the dual
   isogeny).  For each polynomial in variable x, the coefficients are
   tabulated as sequence of coefficients of x^0, x^1, x^2, ..., in
   hexadecimal format.
