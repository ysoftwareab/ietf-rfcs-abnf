        CBOR Encoding of X.509 Certificates (CBOR Certificates)
               draft-mattsson-cose-cbor-cert-compress-05

Abstract

   This document specifies a CBOR encoding of X.509 certificates.  The
   resulting certificates are called CBOR Certificates.  The CBOR
   encoding supports a large subset of RFC 5280, while at the same time
   significantly reduces the size of certificates compatible with RFC
   7925 and IEEE 802.1AR (DevIDs).  When used to re-encode DER encoded
   X.509 certificates, the CBOR encoding can in many cases reduce the
   size of RFC 7925 profiled certificates with over 50%.  The CBOR
   encoding can also be used encode "natively signed" CBOR certificates,
   which does not require re-encoding for the signature to be verified.
   The document also specifies COSE headers as well as a TLS certificate
   type for CBOR certificates.

Internet-DraftCBOR Encoding of X.509 Certificates (CBOR CerDecember 2020


1.  Introduction

   One of the challenges with deploying a Public Key Infrastructure
   (PKI) for the Internet of Things (IoT) is the size and parsing of
   X.509 public key certificates [RFC5280], since those are not
   optimized for constrained environments [RFC7228].  More compact
   certificate representations are desirable.  Due to the current PKI
   usage of DER encoded X.509 certificates, keeping compatibility with
   DER encoded X.509 is necessary at least for a transition period.
   However, the use of a more compact encoding with the Concise Binary
   Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC7049] reduces the certificate size
   significantly which has known performance benefits in terms of
   decreased communication overhead, power consumption, latency,
   storage, etc.

   CBOR is a data format designed for small code size and small message
   size.  CBOR builds on the JSON data model but extends it by e.g.
   encoding binary data directly without base64 conversion.  In addition
   to the binary CBOR encoding, CBOR also has a diagnostic notation that
   is readable and editable by humans.  The Concise Data Definition
   Language (CDDL) [RFC8610] provides a way to express structures for
   protocol messages and APIs that use CBOR.  [RFC8610] also extends the
   diagnostic notation.

   CBOR data items are encoded to or decoded from byte strings using a
   type-length-value encoding scheme, where the three highest order bits
   of the initial byte contain information about the major type.  CBOR
   supports several different types of data items, in addition to
   integers (int, uint), simple values (e.g. null), byte strings (bstr),
   and text strings (tstr), CBOR also supports arrays [] of data items,
   maps {} of pairs of data items, and sequences of data items.  For a
   complete specification and examples, see [RFC7049], [RFC8610], and
   [RFC8742].

   RFC 7925 [RFC7925] and IEEE 802.1AR [IEEE-802.1AR] specify
   certificate profiles for Internet of Things deployments which can be
   applied to lightweight certificate based authentication with, e.g.,
   TLS [RFC8446], DTLS [I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13], COSE [RFC8152], EDHOC
   [I-D.ietf-lake-edhoc] or Compact TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-ctls].  This
   document specifies a CBOR encoding based on [X.509-IoT], which can
   support large parts of [RFC5280].  The encoding support all [RFC7925]
   and IEEE 802.1AR [IEEE-802.1AR] profiled X.509 certificates.  Two
   variants are defined using the same CBOR encoding and differing only
   in what is being signed:

   o  An invertible CBOR re-encoding of DER encoded X.509 certificates
      [RFC5280], which can be reversed to obtain the original DER
      encoded X.509 certificate.

   o  Natively signed CBOR certificates, which further optimizes the
      performance in constrained environments but is not backwards
      compatible with [RFC5280], see Section 7.

   This document specifies COSE headers for use of the CBOR certificates
   with COSE, see Section 9.8.  The document also specifies a TLS
   certificate type for use of the CBOR certificates with TLS (with or
   without additional TLS certificate compression), see Section 9.9.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification makes use of the terminology in [RFC5280],
   [RFC7049], [RFC7228], and [RFC8610].

3.  CBOR Encoding

   This section specifies the content and encoding for CBOR
   certificates, with the overall objective to produce a very compact
   representation supporting large parts of [RFC5280], and everything in
   [RFC7925] and [IEEE-802.1AR].  In the CBOR encoding, static fields
   are elided, elliptic curve points and time values are compressed, OID
   are replaced with short integers, and redundant encoding is removed.
   Combining these different components reduces the certificate size
   significantly, which is not possible with general purpose
   compressions algorithms, see Figure 2.

   The CBOR certificate can be either a CBOR re-encoding of a DER
   encoded X.509 certificate, in which case the signature is calculated
   on the DER encoded ASN.1 data in the X.509 certificate, or a natively
   signed CBOR certificate, in which case the signature is calculated
   directly on the CBOR encoded data (see Section 7).  In both cases the
   certificate content is adhering to the restrictions given by
   [RFC5280].  The re-encoding is known to work with DER encoded
   certificates but might work with other canonical encodings.  The re-
   encoding does not work for BER encoded certificates.

   In the encoding described below, the order of elements in arrays are
   always encoded in the same order as the elements or the corresponding
   SEQUENCE or SET in the DER encoding.

Internet-DraftCBOR Encoding of X.509 Certificates (CBOR CerDecember 2020


3.1.  Message Fields

   The X.509 fields and their CBOR encodings are listed below, and used
   in the definition of CBOR Certificates, see Figure 1.

   CBOR certificates are defined in terms of DER encoded [RFC5280] X.509
   certificates:

   o  version.  The 'version' field is encoded in the
      'cborCertificateType' CBOR int.  The field 'cborCertificateType'
      also indicates the type of the CBOR certificate.  Currently, the
      type can be a natively signed CBOR certificate following X.509 v3
      (cborCertificateType = 0) or a CBOR re-encoded X.509 v3 DER
      certificate (cborCertificateType = 1), see Section 9.1.

   o  serialNumber.  The 'serialNumber' INTEGER value field is encoded
      as the unwrapped CBOR positive bignum (~biguint)
      'certificateSerialNumber'.  Any leading 0x00 byte (to indicate
      that the number is not negative) is therefore omitted.

   o  signature.  The 'signature' field is always the same as the
      'signatureAlgorithm' field and therefore omitted from the CBOR
      encoding.

   o  issuer.  In the general case, the sequence of
      'RelativeDistinguishedName' is encoded as a CBOR array of CBOR
      arrays of Attributes, where each Attribute type and value is
      encoded as a (CBOR int, CBOR text string) pair.  Each
      AttributeType is encoded as a CBOR int (see Figure 4).  The
      AttributeType id-emailAddress is always an IA5String.  For the
      other AttributeTypes, the sign is used to represent the character
      string type; positive for utf8String, negative for
      printableString.  In natively signed CBOR certificates all strings
      are utf8String and the sign has no meaning.  The string types
      teletexString, universalString, and bmpString are not supported.
      If Name contains a single Attribute containing an utf8String
      encoded 'common name' it is encoded as a CBOR text string.  If the
      text string contains an EUI-64 of the form "HH-HH-HH-HH-HH-HH-HH-
      HH" where 'H' is one of the symbol '0'-'9' or 'A'-'F' it is
      encoded as a CBOR byte string of length 8 instead.  EUI-64 mapped
      from a 48-bit MAC address (i.e. of the form "HH-HH-HH-FF-FE-HH-HH-
      HH) is encoded as a CBOR byte string of length 6.

   o  validity.  The 'notBefore' and 'notAfter' fields are encoded as
      unwrapped CBOR epoch-based date/time (~time) where the tag content
      is an unsigned integer.  In POSIX time, leap seconds are ignored,
      with a leap second having the same POSIX time as the second before
      it.  Compression of X.509 certificates with the time 23:59:60 UTC

Internet-DraftCBOR Encoding of X.509 Certificates (CBOR CerDecember 2020


      is therefore not supported.  Note that RFC 5280 mandates encoding
      of dates through the year 2049 as UTCTime, and later dates as
      GeneralizedTime.  The value "99991231235959Z" (no expiration date)
      is encoded as CBOR null.

   o  subject.  The 'subject' is encoded exactly like issuer.

   o  subjectPublicKeyInfo.  The 'algorithm' field is encoded as the
      CBOR int 'subjectPublicKeyAlgorithm' (see Section 9.7) or a CBOR
      OID tag [I-D.ietf-cbor-tags-oid] . Algorithms with parameters are
      not supported except id-ecPublicKey with named curves and the RSA
      algorithms that use parameters = NULL.  For id-ecPublicKey the
      namedCurve parameter is encoded in the CBOR int.  The
      'subjectPublicKey' BIT STRING value field is encoded as a CBOR
      byte string.  This specification assumes the BIT STRING has zero
      unused bits and the unused bits byte is omitted.  Uncompressed
      public keys of type id-ecPublicKey are point compressed as defined
      in Section 2.3.3 of [SECG].  If a DER encoded certificate with a
      point compressed public key of type id-ecPublicKey is CBOR
      encoded, the octets 0xfe and 0xfd are used instead of 0x02 and
      0x03 in the CBOR encoding to represent even and odd y-coordinate,
      respectively.

   o  issuerUniqueID.  Not supported.

   o  subjectUniqueID.  Not supported.

   o  extensions.  The 'extensions' field is encoded as a CBOR array
      where each extension is encoded as either a CBOR int (see
      Section 9.3) followed by an optional CBOR item of any type or a
      CBOR OID tag [I-D.ietf-cbor-tags-oid] followed by a CBOR bool
      encoding 'critical' and the DER encoded value of the 'extnValue'
      encoded as a CBOR byte string.  If the array contains exactly two
      ints and the absolute value of the first int is 2, the array is
      omitted and the extensions is encoded as a single CBOR int with
      the absolute value of the second int and the sign of the first
      int.  Extensions are encoded as specified in Section 3.2.  The
      extensions mandated to be supported by [RFC7925] and
      [IEEE-802.1AR] are given special treatment.  An omitted
      'extensions' field is encoded as an empty CBOR array.

   o  signatureAlgorithm.  The 'signatureAlgorithm' field is encoded as
      a CBOR int (see Section 9.6) or a CBOR OID tag
      [I-D.ietf-cbor-tags-oid].  Algorithms with parameters are not
      supported except RSA algorithms that use parameters = NULL.

   o  signatureValue.  The 'signatureValue' BIT STRING value field is
      encoded as the CBOR byte string issuerSignatureValue.  This

Internet-DraftCBOR Encoding of X.509 Certificates (CBOR CerDecember 2020


      specification assumes the BIT STRING has zero unused bits and the
      unused bits byte is omitted.  ECDSA signatures are given special
      treatment.  For ECDSA signatures the SEQUENCE and INTEGER type and
      length fields are omitted and the two INTEGER value fields are
      padded to the fixed length L = ceil( log2(n) / 8 ), where n is the
      size of the largest prime-order subgroup.  For secp256r1,
      secp384r1, and secp521r1, L is 32, 48, and 66 respectively.  For
      natively signed CBOR certificates the signatureValue is calculated
      over the CBOR sequence TBSCertificate.

   The following Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) defines
   CBORCertificate and TBSCertificate, which are encoded as CBOR
   Sequences [RFC8742].  The member names therefore only have
   documentary value.

   ? critical : bool,        ; present if and only if extensionID is an oid
   extensionValue : any,     ; type known from extensionID
)

3.2.  Encoding of Extensions

   EDITOR'S NOTE: The current specification encodes many common
   extensions with a DER encoded byte string.  It should be discussed if
   more or all commonly active extensions should be natively encoded
   with CBOR.  Would a specific CBOR encoding have to be specified for
   each extension or can a general CBOR encoding that apply to all
   remaining extensions be specified?

   This section details the encoding of the 'extensions' field.  The
   'extensions' field is encoded as a CBOR array where each extensionID
   is encoded as either a CBOR int or a CBOR OID tag.  If 'extensionID'
   is encoded an int (see Section 9.3),the sign is used to encode if the
   extension is critical and the 'critical' field is omitted.  Critical
   extensions are encoded with a positive sign and non-critical
   extensions are encoded with a negative sign.

   The 'extnValue' OCTET STREAM value field is encoded as the CBOR byte
   string 'extensionValue' except for the extensions specified below.
   The 'extensionValue' for the extensions mandated to be supported by
   [RFC7925] and [IEEE-802.1AR] are encoded as follows:

   o  basicConstraints.  If 'cA' = false then extensionValue = -2, if
      'cA' = true and 'pathLenConstraint' is not present then
      extensionValue = -1, and if 'cA' = true and 'pathLenConstraint' is
      present then extensionValue = pathLenConstraint.

   o  keyUsage.  The 'KeyUsage' BIT STRING is interpreted as an unsigned
      integer n in network byte order and encoded as a CBOR int.

   o  extKeyUsage. extensionValue is encoded as an array of CBOR ints
      (see Section 9.4) or CBOR OID tags [I-D.ietf-cbor-tags-oid] where
      each int or OID tag encodes a key usage purpose.  If the array
      contains a single int, the array is omitted.

      ExtValueEKU = [ + int / oid ] / int

   o  subjectAltName. extensionValue is encoded as an array of (int,
      any) pairs where each pair encodes a general name (see
      Section 9.5).  If subjectAltName contains exactly one dNSName, the
      array and the int are omitted and extensionValue is the dNSName
      encoded as a CBOR text string.  In addition to the general names
      defined in [RFC5280], the hardwareModuleName type of otherName has
      been given its own int due to its mandatory use in IEEE 802.1AR.
      When 'otherName + hardwareModuleName' is used, then [ oid, bytes ]
      is used to identify the pair ( hwType, hwSerialEntries ) directly
      as specified in [RFC4108].

      GeneralNames = [ + GeneralName ] / text
      GeneralName = ( GeneralNameType : int, GeneralNameValue : any )

   o  authorityKeyIdentifier. extensionValue is encoded as an array
      where the value of the 'keyIdentifier' is encoded as a CBOR byte
      string, 'GeneralNames' is encoded like in subjectAltName, and
      'AuthorityCertSerialNumber' is encoded as ~biguint exactly like
      certificateSerialNumber.

Internet-DraftCBOR Encoding of X.509 Certificates (CBOR CerDecember 2020


      KeyIdentifier = bytes

   o  subjectKeyIdentifier. extensionValue is the value of the
      'keyIdentifier' field encoded as a CBOR byte string.

   o  cRLDistributionPoints.  If the cRLDistributionPoints is a sequence
      of DistributionPointName, it is encoded like subjectAltName, with
      the difference that if cRLDistributionPoints contains exactly one
      uniformResourceIdentifier, the the array and the int are omitted
      and extensionValue is the uniformResourceIdentifier encoded as a
      CBOR text string.

   o  authorityInfoAccess.  If authorityInfoAccess consist of only
      uniformResourceIdentifiers it is encoded as an array of uris.

      ExtValueAIA = [ + ( ocsp : 1 // caIssuers : 2 , uri : text ) ]

3.2.1.  Example Encoding of Extensions

   The examples below use values from Section 9.3, Section 9.4, and
   Section 9.5:

   o  A critical basicConstraints ('cA' = true) without
      pathLenConstraint is encoded as the two CBOR ints -1, -1.

   o  A non-critical keyUsage with digitalSignature and keyAgreement
      asserted is encoded as the two CBOR ints 2, 17 (2^0 + 2^4 = 17).

   o  A non-critical extKeyUsage containing id-kp-codeSigning and id-kp-
      OCSPSigning is encoded as the CBOR int 3 followed by the CBOR
      array [ 3, 6 ].

   o  A non-critical subjectAltName containing only the dNSName
      example.com is encoded as the CBOR int 4 followed by the CBOR text
      string "example.com".

   Thus, the extension field of a certificate containing all of the
   above extensions in the given order would be encoded as the CBOR
   array [ -1, -1, 2, 17, 3, [ 3, 6 ], 4, "example.com" ].

4.  Compliance Requirements for Constrained IoT

   For general purpose applications, the normative requirements of
   [RFC5280] applies.  This section describes the mandatory to implement
   algorithms and OIDs for constrained IoT application; the values of
   the OIDs including certificate fields and extensions, time format,
   attributes in distinguished names, etc.

Internet-DraftCBOR Encoding of X.509 Certificates (CBOR CerDecember 2020


   TODO: Write this section

5.  Legacy Considerations

   CBOR certificates can be deployed with legacy X.509 certificates and
   CA infrastructure.  In order to verify the signature, the CBOR
   certificate is used to recreate the original X.509 data structure to
   be able to verify the signature.

   For protocols like TLS/DTLS 1.2, where the handshake is sent
   unencrypted, the actual encoding and compression can be done at
   different locations depending on the deployment setting.  For
   example, the mapping between CBOR certificate and standard X.509
   certificate can take place in a 6LoWPAN border gateway which allows
   the server side to stay unmodified.  This case gives the advantage of
   the low overhead of a CBOR certificate over a constrained wireless
   links.  The conversion to X.509 within an IoT device will incur a
   computational overhead, however, measured in energy this is likely to
   be negligible compared to the reduced communication overhead.

   For the setting with constrained server and server-only
   authentication, the server only needs to be provisioned with the CBOR
   certificate and does not perform the conversion to X.509.  This
   option is viable when client authentication can be asserted by other
   means.

   For protocols like IKEv2, TLS/DTLS 1.3, and EDHOC, where certificates
   are encrypted, the proposed encoding needs to be done fully end-to-
   end, through adding the encoding/decoding functionality to the
   server.

6.  Expected Certificate Sizes

   The CBOR encoding of the sample certificate given in Appendix A
   results in the numbers shown in Figure 2.  After [RFC7925] profiling,
   most duplicated information has been removed, and the remaining text
   strings are minimal in size.  Therefore, the further size reduction
   reached with general compression mechanisms will be small, mainly
   corresponding to making the ASN.1 encoding more compact.  The zlib
   number was calculated with zlib-flate.

   zlib-flate -compress < cert.der > cert.compressed

7.  Natively Signed CBOR Certificates

   The difference between CBOR encoded X.509 certificate and natively
   signed CBOR certificate is that the signature is calculated over the
   CBOR encoding of the CBOR sequence TBSCertficate rather than the DER
   encoded ASN.1 data.  This removes entirely the need for ASN.1 DER and
   base64 encodings which reduces the processing in the authenticating
   devices, and avoids known complexities and security issues with these
   encodings.

   Natively signed CBOR certificates can be applied in devices that are
   only required to authenticate to natively signed CBOR certificate
   compatible servers.  This is not a major restriction for many IoT
   deployments, where the parties issuing and verifying certificates can
   be a restricted ecosystem which not necessarily involves public CAs.

   CBOR encoded X.509 certificates provides an intermediate step between
   [RFC7925] or [IEEE-802.1AR] profiled X.509 certificates and natively
   signed CBOR certificates: An implementation of CBOR encoded X.509
   certificates contains both the CBOR encoding of the X.509 certificate
   and the signature operations sufficient for natively signed CBOR
   certificates.

   The natively signed approach based on DER encoded X.509 certificates
   described in this document has also other benefits.  For example, a
   CA can use existing ASN.1 machinery to create a DER encoded
   certificate, the DER encoded certificate can then be transformed to
   CBOR before signing.

8.  Security Considerations

   The CBOR profiling of X.509 certificates does not change the security
   assumptions needed when deploying standard X.509 certificates but
   decreases the number of fields transmitted, which reduces the risk
   for implementation errors.

   The use of natively signed CBOR certificates removes the need for
   ASN.1 encoding, which is a rich source of security vulnerabilities.

   Conversion between the certificate formats can be made in constant
   time to reduce risk of information leakage through side channels.

   The mechanism in this draft does not reveal any additional
   information compared to X.509.  Because of difference in size, it
   will be possible to detect that this profile is used.  The gateway
   solution described in Section 5 requires unencrypted certificates and
   is not recommended.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates several new registries under the new heading
   "CBOR Certificate".  For all items, the 'Reference' field points to
   this document.

   The expert reviewers for the registries defined in this document are
   expected to ensure that the usage solves a valid use case that could
   not be solved better in a different way, that it is not going to
   duplicate one that is already registered, and that the registered
   point is likely to be used in deployments.  They are furthermore
   expected to check the clarity of purpose and use of the requested
   code points.  Experts should take into account the expected usage of
   entries when approving point assignment, and the length of the
   encoded value should be weighed against the number of code points
   left that encode to that size and the size of device it will be used
   on.  Values in the interval [-24, 23] have a 1 byte encodings, other
   values in the interval [-256, 255] have a 2 byte encodings, and the
   remaning values in the interval [-65536, 65535] have 3 byte
   encodings.

9.8.  COSE Header Parameters Registry

   This document registers the following entries in the "COSE Header
   Parameters" registry under the "CBOR Object Signing and Encryption
   (COSE)" heading.  The formatting and processing are the same as the
   corresponding x5bag, x5chain, x5t, and x5u defined in
   [I-D.ietf-cose-x509] except that the certificates are CBOR encoded
   instead of DER encoded.  Note that certificates can also be
   identified with a 'kid' header parameter by storing 'kid' and the
   associated bag or chain in a dictionary.

9.9.  TLS Certificate Types Registry

   This document registers the following entry in the "TLS Certificate
   Types" registry under the "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions"
   heading.  The new certificate type can be used with addtional TLS
   certificate compression [I-D.ietf-tls-certificate-compression].

   EDITOR'S NOTE: The TLS registrations should be discussed and approved
   by the TLS WG at a later stage.  When COSE WG has adopted work on
   CBOR certificates, it could perhaps be presented in the TLS WG.  The
   TLS WG might e.g. want a separate draft in the TLS WG.

Appendix B.  X.509 Certificate Profile, ASN.1

   EDITOR'S NOTE: The ASN.1 below is not up to date with the rest of the
   specification.  The below ASN.1 for RFC 7925 profile should be in
   draft-ietf-uta-tls13-iot-profile instead.  If CBOR Certificates
   support a large subset of RFC 5280, we should probably not duplicate
   all the ASN.1 in that document.  Should be discussed what kind and
   how much (if any) ASN.1 this document needs.  If possible, one option
   would be to have ASN.1 for the restrictions compared to RFC 5280.
