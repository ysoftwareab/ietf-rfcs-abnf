1. Introduction

   This is a sample Internet Standards Documentation (ISD) for the IETF
   Standards Process.  This document follows the model proposed in
   draft-ietf-newtrk-isd-repurposing-isd-00.  This sample is written as
   if the ISD process started being used in 1993 so to show a possible
   history feature.

2.  ISD for the Internet standards Process

   IETF Internet Standards Documentation

   Name of ISD:   ISD xxxx: The IETF Internet Standards Process
   Last update:   17-Oct-2004
   Maintainer:    IESG

A: Abstract
   This ISD documents the process currently used by the Internet
   community for the standardization of protocols and procedures.  The
   Internet Standards process is an activity of the Internet Society
   that is organized and managed on behalf of the Internet community by
   the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering
   Steering Group (IESG).

B: Documents making up the Standard
   RFC 2026
      The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3, S. Bradner (Ed.),
      October 1996. (Status: BCP)
      The Internet Standards Process described in this document is
      concerned with all protocols, procedures, and conventions that are
      used in or by the Internet, whether or not they are part of the
      TCP/IP protocol suite.  In the case of protocols developed and/or
      standardized by non-Internet organizations, however, the Internet
      Standards Process normally applies to the application of the
      protocol or procedure in the Internet context, not to the
      specification of the protocol itself.
      The goals of the Internet Standards Process are:

      o  technical excellence;
      o  prior implementation and testing;
      o  clear, concise, and easily understood documentation;
      o  openness and fairness;  and
      o  timeliness.

      The procedures described in this document are designed to be fair,
      open, and objective; to reflect existing (proven) practice;  and
      to be flexible.

      The community needs this document because it spells out the way we
      develop standards, the steps along the way, and the ways
      disagreements and intellectual property rights are handled.  [note
      in draft - text from 9 Jul 96 Protocol Action announcement]

      After 2026 had been used in the IETF for a number of years it
      became clear that the intellectual property rights (IPR) section
      (Section 10) was confusing because it mixed up patent rights,

      copyrights and trademarks without making the different rules for
      the different types of rights clear.  In addition the
      understanding of what constituted a contribution to the IETF
      evolved.  Because of this two new RFCs were developed (RFC 3667
      and RFC 3668) to clarify the IPR issues.

   RFC 3667
      IETF Rights in Contributions, S. Bradner (Ed.), February 2004.
      (Status: BCP)
      This document (with RFC 3668) replaces section 10 of RFC 2026, and
      provides a much more detailed description of the considerations
      regarding intellectual property that need to be taken into account
      when working in the IETF.
      Particular attention is paid to copyright issues and issues
      concerning requirements for implementation, such as patent
      licensing. [note in draft - text adopted from 03 Nov 2003 Protocol
      Action announcement]

   RFC 3668
      Intellectual Property Rights in IETF Technology, S. Bradner (Ed.),
      February 2004. (Status: BCP)
      This document (with RFC 3667) replaces section 10 of RFC 2026, and
      provides a much more detailed description of the considerations
      regarding intellectual property that need to be taken into account
      when working in the IETF.
      Particular attention is paid to copyright issues and issues
      concerning requirements for implementation, such as patent
      licensing. [note in draft - text adopted from 03 Nov 2003 Protocol
      Action announcement]

C: Additional Relevant Documents
   RFC 3668
      Guidelines for Working Groups on Intellectual Property Issues, S.
      Brim, February 2004. (Status: Informational)
      The "Guidelines" document relates useful experience gathered when
      working with IPR issues in the IETF. [note in draft - text from 03
      Nov 2003 Protocol Action announcement]

D: Extensions to the Standard
   RFC 3932
      The IESG and RFC Editor Documents: Procedures, H. Alvestrand,
      October 2004. (Status: BCP)
      This document describes the IESG's procedures for handling
      documents submitted for RFC publication via the RFC Editor,
      subsequent to the changes proposed by the IESG at the Seoul IETF,
      March 2004. [note in draft - text from 27 Jul 2004 Protocol Action
      announcement]

      This document proposes a way to change IETF processes that
      provides notice to the community (via Last Call), a permanent
      record (via RFCs) and a reasonable expectation that the process
      changes will be evaluated for whether they worked or not, and
      rolled back if they did not work. [note in draft - text from the

      an escape from a situation where the existing procedures are not
      working or do not seem to apply.  This is a modification to the
      procedures of RFC 1602 and 1603. This RFC was created to deal
      with, among other things, an IPR deadlock concerning the PPP
      compression control protocol.  (See RFC 1915.)

   RFC 1602
      The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 2, Internet
      Architecture Board, Internet Engineering Steering Group. March
      1994
      This RFC updated the description of the IETF Internet Standards
      Process to more clearly define the IETF's intellectual property
      related rules.

   RFC 1310
      The Internet Standards Process. L. Chapin. March 1992.
      This RFC was the first description of the IETF Internet Standards
      Process published in a stand alone RFC.  It is now obsolete.
