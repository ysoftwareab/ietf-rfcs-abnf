Abstract

   This document describes two technology independent extensions to
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching.  The first extension
   defines the new switching type Data Channel Switching Capable.  Data
   Channel Switching Capable interfaces are able to support switching of
   the whole digital channel presented on single channel interfaces.
   The second extension defines a new type of generalized label and
   updates related objects.  The new label is called the Generalized
   Channel_Set Label and allows more than one data plane label to be
   controlled as part of an LSP.

1. Introduction

   This document describes two technology independent extensions to
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS).  Both of
   extensions were initially defined to in the context of Ethernet
   services, see [GMPLS-ESVCS] and [GMPLS-MEF-UNI], but are generic in
   nature and may be useful to any switching technology controlled via
   GMPLS.

   The first extension defines a new switching type, which is called
   Data Channel Switching Capable, or DCSC.  DCSC interfaces are able to
   support switching of the whole digital channel presented on single
   channel interfaces.  The second extension defines a new type of
   generalized label and updates related objects.  The new label is
   called the Generalized Channel_Set Label and allows more than one
   data plane label to be controlled as part of an LSP.


1.1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. Data Channel Switching

   Current GMPLS switching types are defined in [RFC3945] and [RFC3471]
   and support switching at the packet (PSC), frame (L2SC), time-slot
   (TDM), frequency (LSC) and fiber (FSC) granularities.  One type of
   switching that is not well represented in this current set switching
   that takes all data received on an ingress port and switches it
   through a network to an egress port.  While there are similarities
   between this level of switching and the "opaque single wavelength"
   case described in Section 3.5 of [RFC4202], such port-to-port
   switching is not limited to the optical switching technology implied
   by the LSC type. Therefore, a new switching type is defined.

   The new switching type is called Data Channel Switching Capable
   (DCSC). (Port switching seems a more intuitive name, but it collides
   with PSC so isn't used.)  DCSC interfaces are able to support
   switching of the whole digital channel presented on single channel
   interfaces.  Interfaces that inherently support multiple channels,
   e.g., WDM and channelized TDM interfaces, are specifically excluded
   from this type. Any interface that can be represented as a single
   digital channel are included.  Examples include concatenated TDM and
   line encoded interfaces.  Framed interfaces may also be included when
   they support switching on an interface granularity.

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-dcsc-channel-ext-00.txt  August 8, 2008


   DCSC is represented in GMPLS, see [RFC3471] and [RFC4202], using the
   value TBA (by IANA).

   Port labels, as defined in [RFC3471], SHOULD be used for LSPs
   signaled using the DCSC Switching Type.


3. Generalized Channel_Set Label Related Formats

   This section defines a new type of generalized label and updates
   related objects.  This section updates the label related definitions
   of [RFC3473].  The ability to communicate more than one label as part
   of the same LSP was motivated by the support for the communication of
   one or more VLAN IDs, but the formats defined in this section are not
   technology specific and may be useful for other switching
   technologies.


3.1. Generalized Channel_Set LABEL_REQUEST Object

   The Generalized Channel_Set LABEL_REQUEST object is used to indicate
   that the Generalized Channel_Set LABEL Object is to be used with the
   associated LSP.  The format of the Generalized Channel_Set
   LABEL_REQUEST object is the same as the Generalized LABEL_REQUEST
   object and uses of C-Type of TBA.


3.2. Generalized Channel_Set LABEL Object

   The Generalized Channel_Set LABEL Object communicates one or more
   labels, all of which can be used equivalently in the data path
   associated with a single LSP.  The format of the Generalized
   Channel_Set LABEL Object is based on the LABEL_SET object defined in
   [RFC3473].  It differs from the the LABEL_SET object in that the full
   set may be represented in a single object rather than the multiple
   objects required by the [RFC3473] LABEL_SET object.  The object MUST
   be used on LSPs that use the Generalized Channel_Set LABEL_REQUEST
   object.  The object MUST be processed per [RFC3473].  Make-before-
   break procedures, see [RFC3209], SHOULD be used when modifying the
   Channel_Set LABEL object.

   The format of the Generalized Channel_Set LABEL object is:

   o  Generalized Channel_Set LABEL object: Class = 16, C-Type = TBA (By
   IANA)

      0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Channel_Set Sub-Object size is measured in bytes and MUST always
   be a multiple of 4, and at least 4, and has the following format:

      Action: 8 bits

         See [RFC3471] for definition of actions.  Range actions SHOULD
         be used when possible to minimize the size of the Channel_Set
         LABEL Object.

Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-dcsc-channel-ext-00.txt  August 8, 2008


      Number of Subchannels: 10 bits

         Indicates the number of subchannels carried in the sub-object.
         When the number of subchannels required exceeds the limit of
         the field, i.e., 1024, multiple Channel_Set Sub-Objects MUST be
         used.  Note that the size of the sub-object may result in a
         Path message being larger than a single unfragmented IP packet.
         See section 4.4 for an example of how this case may be handled.

         A value of zero (0) has special meaning and MAY be used in
         either the LABEL or UPSTREAM_LABEL object.  A value of zero (0)
         is used in a LABEL or UPSTREAM_LABEL object to indicate that
         the subchannel(s) used in the corresponding (downstream or
         upstream) direction MUST match the subchannel(s) carried in the
         reverse directions label object. When value of zero (0) is
         used, no Subchannels are included in the Channel_Set Sub-Object
         and only one Channel_Set Sub-Object may be present.  The zero
         (0) value MUST NOT be used in both the LABEL and UPSTREAM_LABEL
         object of the same LSP.

      Label Type: 14 bits

         See [RFC3473] for a description of this field.

      Subchannel: Variable

         See [RFC3471] for a description of this field. Note that this
         field may not be 32 bit aligned.

      Padding: Variable

         Padding is used to ensure that the length of a Channel_Set Sub-
         Object meets the multiple of 4 byte size requirement stated
         above.  The field is only required when the Subchannel field is
         not 32 bit aligned and the number of included Subchannel fields
         result in the Sub-Object not being 32 bit aligned.

         The Padding field MUST be included when the number of bits
         represented in all the Subchannel fields included in a
         Generalized Channel_Set Sub-Object result in the Sub-Object not
         being 32 bit aligned.  When present, the Padding field MUST
         have a length that results in the Sub-Object being 32 bit
         aligned.  When present, the Padding field MUST be set to a zero
         (0) value on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.
         These bits SHOULD be passed through unmodified by transit
         nodes.

3.3. Other Label related Objects

   The previous section introduces a new LABEL object.  As such the
   formats of the other label related objects are also impacted.
   Processing of these objects is not modified and remain per their
   respective specifications.  The other label related objects are
   defined in [RFC3473] and include:
      - SUGGESTED_LABEL object
      - LABEL_SET object
      - ACCEPTABLE_LABEL_SET object
      - UPSTREAM_LABEL object
      - RECOVERY_LABEL object


4. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to administer assignment of new values for
   namespaces defined in this document and reviewed in this section.


4.1. Data Channel Switching Type

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the assignment in
   the "Switching Types"  section of the "GMPLS Signaling Parameters"
   registry located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/gmpls-sig-
   parameters:

   Value   Type                                      Reference
   -----   ---------------------------               ---------
     125*   Data Channel Switching Capable (DCSC) [This document]

   (*) Suggested value.


4.2. Generalized Channel_Set LABEL_REQUEST Object

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the assignment in
   the "Class Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types" section of the
   "RSVP PARAMETERS" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters.

   A new class type for the existing LABEL_REQUEST Object class number
   (19) with the following definition:

      Class Types or C-Types:

        5* Generalized Channel_Set                  [This document]

   (*) Suggested value.


4.3. Generalized Channel_Set LABEL Object

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the assignment in
   the "Class Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types" section of the
   "RSVP PARAMETERS" registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-parameters.

   A new class type for the existing RSVP_LABEL Object class number (16)
   with the following definition:

      Class Types or C-Types:

        4* Generalized Channel_Set                  [This document]

   (*) Suggested value.


5. Security Considerations

   This document introduces new message object formats for use in GMPLS
   signaling [RFC3473].  It does not introduce any new signaling
   messages, nor change the relationship between LSRs that are adjacent
   in the control plane. As such, this document introduces no additional
   security considerations.  See [RFC3473] for relevant security
   considerations.
