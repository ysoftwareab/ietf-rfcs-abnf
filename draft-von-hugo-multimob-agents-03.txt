Abstract

   This document describes an approach to support multicast listeners
   and senders located within a moving IPv6 network (NEMO). A NEMO
   is built up by at least one Mobile Router (MR) and a set of Mobile
   Network Nodes (MNNs).  The MR handles all routing related tasks to 
   provide connectivity between the MNNs and an access network
   including mobility management.  Correspondingly the MR also
   subscribes to multicast groups and forwards emerging multicast
   traffic on behalf of a MNN.
   For optimised routing of multicast data a hierarchical multicast
   agent is introduced as a logical entity providing an anchor to the
   multicast tree.  In the MR a corresponding functionality is defined
   which decides on the location of the specific agent to be used for a
   distinct multicast traffic.

1. Introduction

   IP Multicast is a resource efficient measure for many promising new 
   mobile applications which often require definite QoS degrees and low 
   delay characteristics (e.g. for video streaming).  The regular change
   of the Point of Attachment (PoA) to the access network infrastructure
   due to mobility, however, is a challenge to preservation of a 
   continuously high quality of multicast service: either routing paths 
   may increase unduly high or a frequent update of branches or even -

   in case of a moving source of multicast traffic - of the complete
   multicast tree will occur.

   A detailed comparison of several approaches towards multicast
   mobility has been provided in [10].  However, an efficient solution
   to the problem turns out to be complex and hence will require effort
   in processing power and energy consumption.  Thus the implementation
   of such a solution at a Mobile Router (MR) instead of each individual
   Mobile Node (MN) will contribute to overall resource savings, as with
   a MR within a MOving NEtwork (NEMO) a single entity for mobile
   multicast control will serve a plurality of terminal nodes.

   This document introduces an approach for mobile IPv6 multicast
   listeners and senders located within NEMOs. A NEMO is characterised
   by a MR and several Mobile Network Nodes (MNNs).  The terminology
   used in this document remains conformal to the definitions in the
   corresponding NEMO document [5].
   All mobility related functionalities are performed by the MR on
   behalf of the MNNs as specified by the NEMO basic support protcol
   [2].  Here additionally the MR also manages Multicast subscription
   and traffic forwarding for the nodes inside the NEMO.  The approach
   described in the following was implemented within the framework of
   ongoing EU IST project Daidalos (Designing Advanced network
   Interfaces for the Delivery and Administration of Location
   independent, Optimised personal Services [8, 12]).  An entity was
   developped which controls multicast traffic distribution and
   reception within the NEMO by means of deciding and selecting the way
   to handle multicast, i.e. the routing path to be chosen.

2. NEMO Multicast

   Control of mobile multicast service related to NEMO is governed by
   the following general principle: All corresponding traffic emerging
   and terminating inside the NEMO is handled via the MR without
   interception from outside.  The MR has to subscribe to multicast
   groups as well as send traffic to multicast addresses on behalf of
   any node inside the NEMO.  In case the requested multicast traffic is
   not sent from another node within the NEMO the MR may join the groups
   via the local Access Router (AR) or via a bi-directional tunnel (BT)
   to the Home Agent (HA).  This procedure has already been described in
   Mobile IPv6 [3].  Correspondingly packets to a multicast groups may
   be sent via the local AR or via the tunnel between HA and MR.  Each
   of both approaches has advantages and drawbacks depending on the MR's
   velocity in terms of frequency of change of PoA (handover rate).  In
   case of high handover rate the remote subscription (RS) at the local
   AR would result in frequent update of subscription status or even

   re-construction of the whole multicast tree.  In case of zero
   velocity of the MR or slow movement compared to session duration the
   BT approach would result in non-optimised routing and long delay.

   This draft proposes the introduction of a new logical entity to
   support mobile multicast reception and transmission.  A Multicast
   Anchor Agent (MAA) is a MultiCast Router enabled to receive and
   forward Multicast traffic by a multicast routing protocol.  The
   dedicated MAA for a NEMO SHOULD be located in between the AR a NEMO
   is attached to and the HA of the NEMO's MR.  All multicast data aimed 
   at nodes outside the NEMO are tunnelled to the MAA to separate
   mobility issues from the multicast tree.  Procedures how to identify
   potential MAAs and criteria for the algorithm used to select the
   optimised MAA are described hereafter.  The basic principle is to
   find the trade-off between optimised routing for multicast traffic
   and routing path re-arrangement effort due to NEMO movement
   characteristics.  Choice for the MAA MUST be governed by the attempt
   to further reduce time delay and overhead effort e.g. on path
   re-construction after handover.

   The MAA approach combines the strengths of BT in terms of low
   multicast tree reconstruction and RS in terms of minimum routing path
   distance, respectively, while counteracting their disadvantages.

2.1. Multicast Agent procedure

   Upon subscription of an MNN within the NEMO to a multicast group, the
   MR forwards the multicast data via a dedicated tunnel to the MAA
   which to choose the MR has decided on.  In case of subscription as
   receiver the request is forwarded utilizing the MLDv2 (Multicast
   Listener Discovery Version 2) [4] protocol.  In case of transmission
   of originating traffic addressed to a multicast group the traffic
   data are sent to the MAA for further distribution.
   
   Corresponding multicast traffic received at the MAA is subsequently
   forwarded by the MAA back to the MR via the bi-directional tunnel.
   This MLD-proxy functionality has been introduced in RFC 4605 [7].
   The applicability to mobile nodes has been described in [9] for
   mobile nodes with the HA as MLD-proxy similar to an MAA.

   Detection of a set of candidate MAAs SHOULD to be performed by the MR
   before applying an algorithm to decide on the best suited serving MAA
   for a specific multicast service.  The set MAY contain the MR's HA,
   the current AR, an AR the MR has attached to previously, and a
   dedicated hierarchical router advertised as MAA.

Internet-Draft          Agent-based NEMO Multicast         February 2009


   The approach to decide dynamically on an AR as optimal Multicast
   Agent named Dynamic Multicast Agent (DMA) has been proposed in [11].

   Instead of performing selection and decision on the site of the
   Multicast agent at the AR we propose to bind this mobile multicast
   feature to the MR functionality.  Thus it is not required to update
   every AR in any network with the intelligent decision algorithm
   thus reducing the affect to the access network infrastructure.  Also
   due to the additional feature taking into account the multicast
   service charcteristic the functionality is more advantageous to
   locate near source and receiver of the multicast traffic, i.e. within
   the NEMO containing those nodes.  On the other hand, the mobile
   multicast control entity may be adapted to be implemented directly at 
   future mobile nodes.

   Multicast traffic is characterised e.g. by session duration,
   direction to or from the NEMO, and service parameters as e.g. QoS
   requirements.
   This information MUST be transferred to the MR together with the
   subscription request.  A potential MAA is characterised by existing
   subscription status and path distance to the MR.  This information
   MAY be collected by the MR via MLD messages sent, e.g. Multicast
   Address Specific Query.  Derivation of distance may be done via
   already established or correspondingly adapted functionalities, as
   e.g. described in [6].  NEMO movement information in terms of
   frequency of change of PoA (handover rate) is typically available at
   the MR thanks to NEMO mobility management protocol [2].  By default
   and in case of high handover rate the MR's HA SHOULD be selected as
   MAA thus representing the BT approach.  In case of zero velocity of
   the MR or slow movement compared to session duration the current AR
   SHOULD be chosen as MAA following RS method.

   Depending on the actual decision also multiple paths towards 
   different MAAs set up via a tunnel mechanism may be used for 
   different multicast groups (flows/sessions) and traffic directions 
   (source/reception).

   To summarise the tasks of new functional entities to be established 
   at the MR are

   o  to forward multicast group management messages and traffic between 
      MNN and the multicast infrastructure via a tunnel towards the 
      selected Multicast Agent (MAA at current AR, old or new AR, MR's 
      HA or hierarchical Multicast Agent)

   o  to keep and update address, distance and multicast group
      subscription status as entries for the current and former

Internet-Draft          Agent-based NEMO Multicast         February 2009


      Multicast Agents to provide information for dynamic selection of 
      the actually used Multicast Agent (default value is MR's HA)

   o  to retrieve current AR information and handover status

   o  to decide on optimum Multicast Agent based on movement, distance,
      AR subscription status, and session/flow information

   An overview on the exchanged messages and initiated traffic flow
   between an end user at the MNN and the corresponding agent is shown
   in Figure 1 for a typical example. The agent is connected to a
   Multicast (MC) environment which is able to transport MC traffic.
   Here the MAA may resemble also a list of different candidate MAAs
   which also contains NEMO-HA and AR beside other MCRs located in the
   access network in between.
   By 'MCAS Query' a Multicast Address Specific Query as defined in [4]
   is denoted.  To decide on a new MAA the MR must send MCAS Queries to
   all candidate MAAs to learn about the subscription state there.
   By SCR the State Change Report message definde in MLDv2 is denoted.
   After decision for a new MAA the old MAA MAY be informed via a SCR
   expressing its desire to stop listening to the specific sources to
   reduce overall network load.  
   At start-up of a multicast subscription at an MNN the list maintained
   at the NEMO-MR may only contain the NEMO-HA and the current AR.
   We assume that speed of the NEMO is high, i.e. the reciprocal of HO
   rate (inter-HO period) is small in comparison to the duration
   expected for the multicast session.  In this case NEMO-MR MAY
   immediately decide for NEMO-HA as best suited MAA.  NEMO-MR therefore
   transmits the MLD report via the tunnel to NEMO-HA and delivers
   Multicast data, correspondingly received at this tunnel, to the MNN.
   Similarily data sent by the MNN to a multicast group address MUST be
   forwarded by NEMO-MR to NEMO-HA via the same tunnel.

   Upon a HO (1) of the NEMO to a new AR the NEMO-MR includes the new AR
   to the MAA list and starts the optimisation routine by sending to all
   MAAs in the list (i.e. NEMO-HA, old AR, and new current AR) an MCAS
   query message.  Upon receiption of corresponding MLD report messages
   as answers NEMO-MR is able to collect information on all potential
   MAAs in its list.  

   When we assume that speed of the NEMO has been reduced considerably
   (e.g. when a train approaches a station) the inter-HO period will be
   comparable to the duration of a multicast session.  On the other
   hand, there is no existing subscription at an MAA (e.g. old AR) but
   the NEMO-HA.  Due to the large path distance to NEMO-HA the algorithm
   will decide for the current AR (located nearby at a short distance)
   as new MAA.  Subsequently the NEMO-MR forwards multicast group

Internet-Draft          Agent-based NEMO Multicast         February 2009


   subscription to the AR to deliver correspondingly received traffic
   data to the MNN. For reasons of network load reduction NEMO-MR MAY
   transmit new status to the NEMO-HA to leave the multicast group in
   case no other listener has subscribed there.

   After some time the NEMO speed will increase again (e.g. the train
   leaves the station).  The next HO (2) starts again an optimisation
   routine by sending MCAS queries to all MAAs within the list which
   meanwhile contains two old ARs.  As the recently joined AR still has
   subscribed to the multicast group and not yet a high enough HO rate
   at the MR has been achieved, the decision at the MR may be for the
   recently left AR as MAA.  Multicast group subscription is reported
   (again) to the MAA, however, now from a different Care-of Address.
   Via a check of the MAA's IP address the identity of former and new
   MAA is verified.  Therefore an update on multicast subscription
   status at the old MAA MUST NOT be sent.

   After establishment of the new MAA multicast data correspondingly
   received at the MR is delivered to MNN and multicast traffic
   originating within the NEMO will be forwarded to the MAA.

3. Open issues

   The approach described above up to now only considers Local Fixed 
   Nodes (LFNs) as MNNs.  Further optimisation of multicast support for 
   the situation of Visiting Mobile Nodes (VMNs) and the attachmant of 
   further NEMOs to an MR (nested NEMO) requires measures to transfer 
   beside multicast group information also history on prior assigned 
   MAAs to update the data base with.

   Also the investigation on how to proceed to a proactive decision for
   proper MMA during handover would require further investigation which 
   is currently out of scope for the document.

   Further the extension of a NEMO specific approach to a general
   solution for Mobile Multicast optimisation should be achieved dealing
   also with the challenge of enhanced complexity as pointed out in
   [12].

4. Security Considerations

   This document covers an approach to support multicast service for
   Moving Networks.  Security issues considered for NEMO [2] also apply 
   here.  Threats for multicast group control messages and issues to 
   verify a multicast agent's identity have to be addressed by future 
   solutions.

5. IANA Considerations

   No assumptions on IANA registry have been regarded in this draft.
   Therefore this document has no actions for IANA.

6. Conclusions

   Within this draft an approach for more efficient mobile multicast 
   data communication with respect to moving networks has been 
   presented.  An improved routing solutions in the framework of IPv6 
   network mobility as enabled by IETF protocol NEMO (RFC 3963 [2]) has
   been developed and implemented within the Daidalos I demonstrator
   [8] operated under Linux.  Outcomes of the implementation have been 
   reported in [13]. The approach to increase efficiency of multicast
   traffic in mobile networks is based on a proposed decision procedure
   to optimise the choice of the serving multicast agent which relies on
   characteristics as service parameters, traffic origination, and speed
   of movement (handover rate) of the mobile networks.
