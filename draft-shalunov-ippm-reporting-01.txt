Abstract

   The aim of this document is to define a small set of metrics that are
   robust, easy to understand, orthogonal, relevant, and easy to
   compute.  The IPPM WG has defined a large number of richly
   parameterized metrics because network measurement has many purposes.
   Often, the ultimate purpose is to report a concise set of metrics
   describing a network's state to an end user.  It is for this purpose
   that the present set of metrics is defined.

2.  Goals and Motivation

   The IPPM working group has defined many richly parameterized
   performance metrics with a number of variants (one-way delay, one-way
   loss, delay variation, reordering, etc.) and a protocol for obtaining
   the measurement data needed to compute these metrics (OWAMP).  It
   would be beneficial to define a standard way to report a set of
   performance metrics to end users.  Parameterization might be
   acceptable in such a set, but there must still be defaults for
   everything.  It is especially important to get these defaults right.
   Such a set would enable different tools to produce results that can
   be compared against each other.

   The set is meant for human consumption.  It must therefore be small.
   Anything greater than half-dozen numbers is certainly too confusing.

   Each of the metrics must be statistically robust.  Intuitively, this
   means that having a small number of bad data points and a small
   amount of noise must not dramatically change the metric.

   Each metric in the set must have, qualitatively, an immediate
   intuitive meaning that has to be obvious for an advanced end user
   without consulting documentation (that is, it has to be clear what
   rough meaning, intuitively, the larger values of a given metric
   have).

   To be small, the set has to be orthogonal: each of the metrics has to
   express a property not covered by other metrics (otherwise, there's
   redundancy).

   The metrics in the set must be relevant.  Partly, being easy to
   understand will help achieve this, but additional constraint may be
   placed by relevancy.

   Finally, while this set will most frequently be computed for small
   data sets, where efficiency is not a serious consideration, it must
   be possible to compute for large data sets, too.  In particular, it
   must be possible to compute the metrics in a single pass over the
   data using a limited amount of memory (i.e., it must be possible to
   take a source of measurement data with a high data rate and compute
   the metrics on the fly, discarding each data point after it is
   processed).

3.  Reportable Metrics Set

   The following metrics comprise the set:

   1.  delay;

   2.  loss;

   3.  jitter;

   4.  duplication;

   5.  reordering.

   Each of the above is represented by a single numeric quantity,
   computed as described below.

3.1.  Delay

   The reported delay is the median of all delays in the sample.  When a
   packet is lost, its delay is to be considered +infinity for the
   purposes of this computation; therefore, if more than half of all
   packets are lost, the delay is +infinity.

   FIXME: References.

3.2.  Loss

   Loss is the fraction, expressed in per cent, of packets that did not
   arrive intact within a given number of seconds (timeout value) after
   being sent.  Since this set of metrics often has to be reported to a
   waiting human user, the default timeout value has to be small.  By
   default, 2 seconds MUST be the timeout value.

   FIXME: References.

3.3.  Jitter

   Jitter is the interquartile spread of delay.  In other words, jitter
   is equal to the difference of the 75th and 25th percentiles of delay.
   When both percentiles are +infinity, the value of jitter is
   undefined.  Therefore, if less than 25% of packets are lost, jitter
   is defined and finite; if between 75% and 25% of packets are lost,
   jitter is +infinity; finally, if more than 75% of packets are lost,
   jitter is undefined.

   FIXME: References.

3.4.  Duplication

   Duplication is the fraction of packets for which more than a single
   copy of the packet was received within the timeout period, expressed
   in percentage points.

   Note: while most received packets can be ones previously seen,
   duplication can never exceed 100%.

   FIXME: References (tough one---IPPM hasn't defined duplication).

3.5.  Reordering

   Reordering is the fraction of sent packets for which the sequence
   number of the packet received immediately before the first copy of
   the given packet is not the decrement of the sequence number of the
   given packet.  For the purposes of determining the sequence number of
   the preceding packet in this definition, assuming sequence numbers
   starting with 1, an extra packet at the start of the stream of
   received packets, with a sequence number of 0, is considered to be
   present (this extra packet, of course, is not counted for the
   purposes of computing the fraction).

   FIXME: References.

4.  Security Considerations

   The reporting per se, not being a protocol, does not raise security
   considerations.

   An aspect of reporting relevant to security is how the reported
   metrics are used and how they are collected.  If it is important that
   the metrics satisfy certain conditions (e.g., that the ISP whose
   network is being measured be unable to make the metrics appear better
   than they are), the collection mechanism MUST ensure that this is,
   indeed, so.  The exact mechanisms to do so our outside of scope of
   this document and belong with discussion of particular measurement
   data collection protocols.

5.  Internationalization Considerations

   The reported metrics, while they might occasionally be parsed by
   machine, are primarily meant for human consumption.  As such, they
   MAY be reported in the language preferred by the user, using an
   encoding suitable for the purpose, such as UTF-8.
