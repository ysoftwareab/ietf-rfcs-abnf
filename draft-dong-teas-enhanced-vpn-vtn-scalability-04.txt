           Scalability Considerations for Enhanced VPN (VPN+)
            draft-dong-teas-enhanced-vpn-vtn-scalability-04

Abstract

   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to meet the needs of some customers or
   applications, including the customers and applications that are
   associated with 5G, which requires connectivity services with
   advanced characteristics, such as the assurance of some Service Level
   Objectives (SLOs) and specific Service Level Expectations (SLEs).
   VPN+ could be used for network slice realization both in the context
   of 5G and in more generic scenarios, such as enterprise services
   which have requirement on the performance assurance.  With the demand
   for VPN+ services increases, scalability would become an important
   factor for the large scale deployment of VPN+. This document
   describes the scalability considerations about the network control
   plane and data plane in enabling VPN+ services, some optimization
   mechanisms are also proposed.

Internet-Draft              VPN+ Scalability                October 2021


1.  Introduction

   Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have served the industry well as a
   means of providing different customers with logically separated
   connectivity services over a common network infrastructure.  The
   common or base network that is used to provide the VPNs is often
   referred to as the underlay, and the VPNs are often called the
   overlay.  The underlay network is responsible for establishing the
   network connectivity and managing the network resources to meet
   specific service requirement.  The overlay network is used to
   distribute the membership and reachability information of the
   customers, and provide logical separation in terms of service
   delivery between different customers in the shared network.

   Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to meet the needs of some customers or
   applications, including the applications that are associated with 5G,
   which requires connectivity services with advanced characteristics,
   such as the assurance of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and specific
   Service Level Expectations (SLEs).
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] defines the terminologies and the
   general framework of IETF network slices.  VPN+ could be used for
   IETF network slice realization both in the context of 5G and in more
   generic scenarios, such as enterprise services which have requirement
   on the performance assurance.

   [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] describes the framework for delivering
   VPN+ services.  To meet the requirement of some VPN+ services, a
   Virtual Transport Networks (VTNs) need to be created, which has a
   subset of network resources allocated from the physical network and
   is associated with a logical network topology to meet the
   requirements of one or a group of VPN+ services.  VPN+ services can
   be delivered by mapping one or a group of overlay VPNs to the
   appropriate VTNs as the virtual underlay.

   Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] provides some general
   analysis of the scalability of VPN+. This document gives further
   analysis of the scalability considerations when a large number of
   VPN+ services needs to be provided.  Since the scalability of the
   overlay is usually not the major bottleneck, this document mainly
   focuses on the scalability of the VTNs in the underlay .

2.  VPN+ Scalability Requirements

   As described in [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn], VPN+ services may
   require additional state to be introduced into the network to take
   advantage of the enhanced functionality.  This may introduces some
   concerns about the network scalability.  This section gives some
   analysis of the number of VPN+ services and the VTNs that might be
   needed in different network scenarios.

   Since the typical use case of VPN+ is to deliver IETF network slice
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] for customers and services in 5G
   and other scenarios, the number of IETF network slices required could
   reflect the number of VPN+ needed in the network.  With the
   development and evolution of 5G and other services, it is expected
   that an increasing number of IETF network slices will be deployed.
   The number of network slices required depends on how IETF network
   slices will be used, and the progress of network slicing for the
   vertical industrial services.  The potential number of VPN+ services
   and VTNs is analyzed by classifying the network slice deployment into
   three typical scenarios:

   1.  IETF network slices can be used by a network operator for
       different types of services.  For example, in a converged multi-
       service network, different IETF network slices can be created to
       carry mobile transport service, fixed broadband service and
       enterprise services respectively, each type of service could be
       managed by a separate department or management team.  Some
       service types, such as multicast service may also be deployed in
       a dedicated network slice.  In this case, a separate VTN may need
       to be created for each service type.  It is also possible that a
       network infrastructure operator provides IETF network slices to
       other network operators as a wholesale service, and a VTN may
       also be needed for each wholesale service customer.  In this
       scenario, the number of VTNs in a network could be relatively
       small, such as in the order of 10 or so.  This could be one of
       the typical cases in the beginning of IETF network slice
       deployment.

   2.  IETF network slices can be requested by customers in vertical
       industries, where the assurance of SLOs and the fulfilment of
       SLEs are quite important.  At the early stage of the vertical
       industrial services, a few top customers in some industries will
       begin to use IETF network slices to provide performance assurance
       to their business, such as smart grid, manufacturing, public
       safety, on-line gaming, etc.  The realization of such IETF
       network slices typically requires to provide different VTNs for
       different industries, and some top customers can require
       dedicated VTNs for strict service performance guarantee.

Internet-Draft              VPN+ Scalability                October 2021


       Considering the number of vertical industries, and the number of
       top customers in each industry, the number of VTNs needed may be
       in the order of 100.

   3.  With the evolution of 5G and cloud networks, IETF network slices
       could be widely used by various vertical industrial customers and
       enterprise customers who require guaranteed or predictable
       service performance.  The total amount of IETF network slices may
       increase to thousands or more, although it is expected that the
       number of IETF network slices would still be less than the number
       of traditional VPN services in the network.  Accordingly, the
       number of VTNs needed may be in the order of 1000.

   As defined by 3GPP [TS23501], a 5G network slice is identified using
   the Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information (S-NSSAI),
   which is a 32-bit identifier comprised of 8-bit Slice/Service Type
   (SST) and 24-bit Slice Differentiator (SD).  This allows the mobile
   networks (the RAN and mobile core networks) to support a large number
   of 5G network slices.  Although it is likely that multiple 5G network
   slices are mapped to the same IETF network slice, in some cases the
   number of IETF network slices may still be comparable to the number
   of 5G network slices.

                      8-bit              24-bit
                  +------------+-------------------------+

                  +------------+-------------------------+

                   Figure 1. Format of S-NSSAI in 3GPP

   Thus solution of VPN+ and VTN needs to meet the scalability
   requirement of IETF network slices in different scenarios.  The
   increased number of VPN+ services will introduce additional
   complexity and overhead both to the control plane and the data plane,
   especially in the aspects related to the underlay VTNs.  Although in
   many cases multiple VPN+ services can be mapped to the same VTN as
   the underlay, there still can be scalability challenges with the
   increased number of VTNs.

3.  VTN Scalability Considerations

   In this section, the scalability of VTN in the control plane and data
   plane is analyzed to understand the possible gaps in meeting the
   scalability requirement of VPN+ and VTN.

3.1.  Control Plane Scalability

   As described in [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn], the control plane of
   VPN+ could be based on the hybrid of a centralized controller and the
   distributed control plane.

3.1.1.  Distributed Control Plane

   At part of the delivery of VPN+ services, it is necessary to create
   multiple VTNs, each of which is allocated with a set of dedicated or
   shared network resources, and is associated with a customized logical
   topology.  The topological and resource attributes and the state
   information of each VTN may need to be exchanged among the network
   nodes.  The scalability of the distributed control plane used for the
   distribution of VTN information needs to be considered in the
   following aspects:

   *  The number of control protocol instances maintained on each node

   *  The number of protocol sessions maintained on each link

   *  The number of routes advertised by each node

   *  The amount of attributes associated with each route

   *  The number of route computation (i.e.  SPF computation) executed
      by each node

   As the number of VTNs increases, it is expected that in some of the
   above aspects, the overhead in the control plane may increase
   dramatically.  For example, the overhead of maintaining separated
   control protocol instances (e.g.  IGP instances) for different VTNs
   is considered higher than maintaining the information of separated
   VTNs in the same control protocol instance with appropriate
   separation, and the overhead of maintaining separate protocol
   sessions for different VTNs is considered higher than using a shared
   protocol session for the information exchange of multiple VTNs.  To
   meet the requirement of the increasing number of VTNs, It is
   suggested to choose the control plane mechanisms which could improve
   the scalability while still provide the required functionality.

3.1.2.  Centralized Control Plane

   By introducing the centralized network controller, the SDN approach
   can reduce the amount of control plane overhead in the distributed
   control plane, while it may also transfer some of the scalability
   concerns from network nodes to the centralized controller, thus the
   scalability of the controller also needs to be considered.

Internet-Draft              VPN+ Scalability                October 2021


   To provide global optimization for the Traffic Engineered (TE) paths
   in different VTNs, the controller needs to keep the topology and
   resource information of all the VTNs up-to-date.  To achieve this,
   the controller may need to maintain a communication channel with each
   network node in the network.  When there is significant change in the
   network, or multiple VTNs requires global optimization concurrently,
   there may be a heavy processing burden at the controller, and a heavy
   load in the network surrounding the controller for the distribution
   of the updated network state and the TE paths.

3.2.  Data Plane Scalability

   To provide different VPN+ services with the required SLOs and SLEs,
   it is necessary to allocate different subsets of network resources to
   different VTNs to avoid or reduce unexpected interruption.  As the
   number of VTNs increases, it is required that the underlying network
   can provide fine-granular network resource partitioning, which means
   the amount of state about the partitioned network resources to be
   maintained on the network nodes will also increase.

   In packet forwarding, VPN+ service traffic needs to be processed
   separately according to the topology and resource attributes of the
   VTN it mapped to, this means that some fields in the data packet
   needs to be used to identify the VTN topology and resources either
   directly or implicitly.  Different approaches of encapsulating the
   VTN information in data packet can have different scalability
   implications.

   One practical approach is to reuse some of the existing fields in the
   data packet to additionally identify the VTN the packet belongs to.
   For example, the destination IP addresses or the MPLS forwarding
   labels may be reused to further identify a VTN.  This can avoid the
   cost of introducing new fields in the data packet, while since it
   introduces additional semantics to the existing fields, the
   processing of the existing fields in packet forwarding may need to be
   changed.  Moreover, introducing VTN semantics to existing identifiers
   in the packet (e.g.  IP addresses, MPLS forwarding labels, etc.) may
   result in the increase of the amount of the existing IDs in
   proportion to the number of the VTNs, which may cause scalability
   problem in networks where a relatively large number of VTNs is
   needed.

Internet-Draft              VPN+ Scalability                October 2021


   An alternative approach is to introduce a new dedicated field in the
   data packet for VTN identification.  This could avoid the impacts to
   the existing fields in the packet.  And if this new field carries a
   global-significant VTN identifier, it could be used together with the
   existing fields to determine the VTN-specific packet forwarding.  The
   potential issue with this approach is the difficulty in introducing a
   new field in some of the data plane technologies.

   In addition, the introduction of per VTN packet forwarding has impact
   on the scalability of the forwarding entries on network nodes, as a
   network node may need to maintain separate forwarding entries for
   each VTN it participates in.

3.3.  Gap Analysis of Existing Mechanisms

   One candidate mechanism to build VTN is to use VTN-specific Segment
   Routing (either SR-MPLS or SRv6) Identifiers in the data plane as
   described in [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn], and define and
   distribute the associated topology and resource attribute of each VTN
   based on either Multi-topology [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-sr-vtn-mt], Flex-
   Algo [I-D.zhu-lsr-isis-sr-vtn-flexalgo] or the combination of these
   mechanisms in the control plane.  This mechanism is suitable for
   networks where a small number of VTNs is needed.  As the number of
   VTNs increases, there may be several scalability challenges with this
   approach:

   1.  The number of SR SIDs needed will increase in proportion to the
       number of VTNs in the network, which will bring challenges both
       to the distribution of SIDs and the related information in the
       control plane, and to the installation of forwarding entries for
       VTN-specific SIDs in the data plane.

   2.  The number of route computation (e.g.  SPF computation) will
       increase in proportion to the number of VTNs in the network,
       which may introduce significant overhead to the control plane of
       network nodes.

   3.  The maximum number of logical topologies supported by OSPF is
       128, and the maximum number of Flex-Algo is 128, which may not
       meet the required number of VTNs in some network scenarios.

4.  Proposed Scalability Optimizations

4.1.  Control Plane Optimizations

   For the distributed control plane, several optimizations can be
   considered to reduce the control plane overhead and improve the
   control plane scalability.

   The first optimization mechanism is to reduce the amount of control
   plane sessions used for the establishment and maintenance of the
   VTNs.  For multiple VTNs which have the same peering relationship
   between two adjacent network nodes, it is proposed that one single
   control protocol session is used for the establishment of multiple
   VTNs.  The information of different VTNs can be exchanged over the
   same session, with necessary identification information to
   distinguish the VTNs in the control messages.  This could reduce the
   overhead of maintaining a large number of control protocol sessions
   for different VTNs, and could also reduce the amount of control plane
   messages flooded in the network.

   The second optimization mechanism is to decompose the attributes of a
   VTN into different groups, so that different types of VTN attribute
   can be advertised and processed separately in control plane.  There
   are two basic types of attributes associated with a VTN: the topology
   attribute and the network resource attribute.  In a network, it is
   possible that multiple VTNs share the same topology, and multiple
   VTNs may share the same set of network resources on particular
   network nodes and links.  Then it is more efficient if only one copy
   of the topology information is advertised, and multiple VTNs sharing
   the same topology could refer to this topology information.  More
   importantly, with this approach, the result of topology-based route
   computation could be shared by multiple VTNs, so that the overhead of
   per-VTN route computation could also be reduced . Similarly,
   information of a subset of network resources reserved on a particular
   network node or link could be advertised once and be referred to by
   multiple VTNs which share the same set of resources.  This
   methodology could also apply to other attributes of VTN which may be
   introduced later and can be processed independently.

   Figure 2 gives an example of two VTNs which share the same logical
   topology.  As shown in the figure, VTN-1 and VTN-2 are associated
   with the same topology, while the resource attributes of each VTN are
   different.  In this case, only one copy of the network topology
   information needs to be advertised, and the topology-based route
   computation result can be shared by the two VTNs to generate the
   corresponding routing and forwarding tables.

   Figure 3 gives another example of two VTNs which share the same set
   of network resources on some of the links.  In this case, information
   about the resources allocated on each link only needs to be
   advertised once, then both VTN-1 and VTN-2 could refer to the
   reserved link resource for constraint based path computation.

   For the optimization of the centralized control plane, it is
   suggested that the centralized controller is used as a complementary
   mechanism to the distributed control plane rather than a replacement,
   so that the workload for VTN specific path computation in control
   plane could be shared by both the centralized controller and the
   network nodes, and the scalability of both systems could be improved.

4.2.  Data Plane Optimizations

   To support more VPN+ services while keeping the amount of data plane
   state at a reasonable scale, one typical approach is to classify a
   set of VPN+ services which have similar service characteristics and
   performance requirements into a group, and such group of VPN+
   services are mapped to one VTN, which is allocated with an aggregated
   set of network resources and the union of the required logical
   topologies to meet the service requirement of the whole group of VPN+
   services.  Different groups of VPN+ services can be mapped to
   different VTNs with different set of network resources allocated.
   With appropriate grouping of VPN+ services, a reasonable number of
   VTNs with network resources reservation and aggregation could still
   meet the service requirements.

   Another optimization in the data plane is to decouple the identifiers
   used for topology-based forwarding and the identifier used for the
   resource-specific processing introduced by VTN.  One possible
   mechanism is to introduce a dedicated VTN Resource identifier in the
   packet header to uniquely identify the set of local network resources
   allocated to a VTN on each network node for the processing and
   forwarding of the received packets.  Then the existing identifiers in
   the packet header used for topology based forwarding (e.g. the
   destination IP address, MPLS forwarding labels) are kept unchanged.
   The benefit is the amount of the existing topology-specific
   identifiers will not be impacted by the increasing number of VTNs.
   Since this new VTN Resource ID field will be used together with other
   existing fields to determine the VTN-specific packet forwarding, this
   may require network nodes to support a hierarchical forwarding table
   in data plane.  Figure 4 shows the concept of using different data
   plane identifiers for topology-specific and resource-specific packet
   forwarding and processing in a VTN respectively.

      Figure 4. Decoupled Data Plane Topology and Resource Identifiers

   In an IPv6 [RFC8200] based network, this could be achieved by
   introducing a dedicated field in either the IPv6 fixed header or the
   extension headers to carry the VTN resource identifier for the
   resource-specific forwarding, while keeping the destination IP
   address field used for routing towards the destination prefix in the
   corresponding topology.  Note that the VTN resource ID needs to be
   parsed by every node along the path which is capable of VTN-specific
   forwarding.  [I-D.dong-6man-enhanced-vpn-vtn-id] introduces the
   mechanism of carrying the VTN resource ID in IPv6 Hop-by-Hop
   extension header.

   In an MPLS [RFC3032] based network, this may be achieved by
   introducing a dedicated VTN resource ID either in the MPLS label
   stack or following the MPLS label stack.  This way, the existing MPLS
   forwarding labels could be used for topology-specific packet
   forwarding towards the destination node, and the VTN resource ID is
   used to determine the set of network resources for packet processing.
   This requires that both the forwarding label and the VTN Resource ID
   be parsed by nodes along the forwarding path of the packet, and the
   forwarding behavior may depend on the position of the VTN resource ID
   in the packet.  The detailed extensions in MPLS data plane are out of
   the scope of this document.

5.  Solution Evolution for Improved Scalability

   Based on the analysis in this document, the control plane and data
   plane for VPN+ and VTN needs to evolve to support the increasing
   number of VPN+ services and the increasing number of VTNs in the
   network.

Internet-Draft              VPN+ Scalability                October 2021


   At the first step, by introducing resource-awareness to segment
   routing SIDs [I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments], and using
   Multi-Topology or Flex-Algo as the control plane, it could provide a
   solution for building a limited number of VTNs in the network to meet
   the requirement of a relatively small number of VPN+ services in the
   network.  This mechanism is considered as the basic SR VTN.

   As the required number of VPN+ services increases, more VTNs may be
   needed, then the control plane scalability could be improved by
   decoupling the topology attribute from the resource attribute and
   other attributes of VTN, so that multiple VTNs could share the same
   topology or resource attribute to reduce the control plane and data
   plane overhead.  This mechanism is considered as the scalable SR VTN.
   Both the basic and the scalable SR VTN mechanisms are described in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-for-enhanced-vpn].

   If the data plane scalability becomes a concern, a dedicated VTN
   resource ID can be introduced in the data packet to decouple the
   topology-specific identifiers from the VTN resource identifiers in
   the data plane, this could help to reduce the number of SR SIDs
   needed to support a large number of VTNs.  This mechanism is
   considered as the Resource-Independent (RI) VTN.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the scalability considerations about the
   network control plane and data plane in enabling VPN+ services and
   the VTNs, and proposes several scalability optimization mechanisms.
   The security considerations in [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] applies
   to this document.
