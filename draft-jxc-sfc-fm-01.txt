1. Introduction

   This document discusses Operations, Administration and Maintenance
   (OAM), specifically, fault management of Service Function Chaining
   (SFC), and further provides a solution that can be used in SFC OAM.



   An SFC layer OAM framework was described in [I-D.aldrin-sfc-oam-
   framework], which introduced multiple layers of OAM model including
   the link layer, the network layer, service layer. The link layer and
   the network layer can leverage existing OAM tool sets available to
   perform OAM function, and thus out of scope of this document.

Internet-Draft            SFC Fault Management            October 2014


   This document is focused on the SFC OAM mechanism in service layer.
   Currently the service layer does not have OAM tools yet, and new OAM
   tools should be developed according to the characteristic of service
   layer. In the design of SFC OAM, one important principle is to reuse
   existing OAM tools as much as possible. As a result, methods in this
   document follow some existing OAM mechanisms, e.g. Ping, BFD, etc.

   A requisite of SFC OAM is that SFC OAM messages must follow the same
   data path as normal SFC packets would traverse. This is usually
   called "In-band" signaling. SFC OAM tools are used primarily to
   validate the SFC data plane, and may further be used to verify the
   SFC data plane against the SFC control plane.

   SFC OAM tools discussed in this document include Connectivity
   Function, Continuity Function, and Trace Function.

   SFC Connectivity Function is used to verify the connectivity existing
   between classifier or service function and another service function.
   Connectivity verification packets will travel along the tested
   service chain path to an anticipant endpoint.

   SFC Continuity Function is used to validate or verify the constant
   reachability for a specific SFP. It can detect failure between a
   source device and destination device in a periodic of time, which
   usually be used in fast fault detection.

   SFC Trace Function is used to locate the fault position. The trace
   request packets will travel along the SFP, it will trigger every
   transit device to generate response. The trace reply message will
   carry information for fault location.

   Details of these SFC functions are described in section 3.

1.2. Terminology

   Maintenance Entity Group (MEG): The set of one or more maintenance
   entities that maintain and monitor a section or a transport path in
   an OAM domain.

   MEP: MEG End Point, an OAM end point capable of initiating (source
   MEP) and terminating (sink MEP) OAM packets for fault management and
   performance monitoring.

   MIP: MEG Intermediate Point, an OAM intermediate point terminates and
   processes OAM packets that are sent to this particular MIP and may
   generate OAM packets in reaction to received OAM packets.

   Service Chaining Header: a header in front of packet, added by an SFF.
   SFF uses service chaining header information to forward service
   chaining packet.

   Service Chaining Packet: an original packet added with a service
   chaining header.

   Terminologies introduced in [I-D.ietf-sfc-architecture] will not be
   repeated here.



1.3. SFC OAM Requirements

   The following SFC OAM requirements MUST be supported:

   (R1) SFC OAM MUST allow for continuity check between SFFs.

   (R2) SFC OAM MUST allow for connectivity verification between SFFs.

   (R3) SFC OAM MUST support trace routing in a service function path.

   (R4) SFC OAM MUST support connectivity verification between SFs in an
   SFC chain.

   (R5) SFC OAM MUST support performance measurements in SFs and SFFs.

   (R6) SFC OAM MUST support monitoring of unidirectional and bi-
   directional SFC path.

   (R7) SFC OAM MUST support fate sharing of SFC OAM packets and SFC
   service packets on the same SFC path (congruent path).

Internet-Draft            SFC Fault Management            October 2014




   Since control plane is not a prerequisite for SFC, we cannot resort
   to control plane hello session. Furthermore, OAM packets need to be
   transported on the same data path as the SFC packets, so that any
   data plane failure can be identified.

   Therefore, there is a need to provide an OAM tool that would enable
   users to detect failures in the SFC data plane, and a mechanism to
   isolate and identify faults.

   This document discusses the fault management problem in SFC. The
   basic idea is to verify that packets in a particular Service Function
   Chain actually passing through the SFFs and SFs along the respective
   SFC path.

   It is proposed that this test be carried out by sending an OAM
   message (called an "SFC trace request message") across an SFC path.
   The SFC trace request message carries the SFC identifier whose SFC
   path is being verified.  This SFC OAM request message is forwarded on
   the SFC path just like any SFC data packet belonging to that Service
   Function Chain.

   The OAM message is processed by each SFF along the SFC, and the SFF
   will respond with an SFC trace Reply message, carrying information
   such as the previous SF identifier and its position in the SFC.

3. Theory of Operation

   In order to describe SFC OAM in an abstract way, we reuse some
   nomenclatures in MPLS WG. SFC OAM operates in the context of
   Maintenance Entities (MEs) that define a relationship between two
   points of a service function path to which maintenance and monitoring
   operations apply. The two points that define a maintenance entity are
   called Maintenance Entity Group End Points (MEPs).

   An abstract reference model for an ME is illustrated in Figure 4
   below:

                         +-+    +-+    +-+    +-+
                         |A|----|B|----|C|----|D|
                         +-+    +-+    +-+    +-+
                      Figure 4 SFC OAM Reference Model

   In Figure 4, node A can be a classifier or an entry SFF, node D can
   be an exit SFF, and node B and C can be any SFF or SF (with the
   restriction that any two SFs cannot be directly connected in SFC
   forwarding layer) on the SFC path.

   In general, MEG End Points (MEPs) are the source and sink points of a
   MEG for SFC OAM.

3.1. Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification of SFC

   Proactive Continuity Check (CC) can be used to detect a loss of
   continuity defect between two MEPs in a MEG.

   Proactive Connectivity Verification (CV) can be used to detect an
   unexpected connectivity defect between two MEGs or unexpected
   connectivity within the MEG with an unexpected MEP.

   BFD can also be used as a tool of proactive CC & CV in SFC, where BFD
   Control packets must be sent along the same path as the monitored SFC
   path.


3.1.1. MEP sending an SFC CC-CV packet

   A source MEP can proactively sends CC-CV packets periodically to its
   sink peer MEP. An SFC CC-CV packet is an SFC CC-CV message
   encapsulated with an SFC Header. The SFC header is set as described
   in [I-D.niu-sfc-mechanism] and its flag O MUST be set to 1.

   The SFC OAM message is set as follows:


Jiang and et al        Expires April 27, 2015                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            SFC Fault Management            October 2014


   - The message type MUST be set to 1.

   - The Sender's Handle is set by the original sender, and MUST be set
      with the sender's identifier.

   - The Sequence Number is set with a random value.


3.1.2. MEP terminating an SFC CC-CV packet

   A sink MEP detects a loss of continuity defect when it fails to
   receive proactive CC-V OAM packets from the source MEP for a
   consecutive time.

   When CC-V packets are received by a sink MEP, it is parsed. If any
   mis-connectivity defect is detected, a warning should be raised and
   fault management system should be notified of the detected defects.


3.2. SFC Route Tracing

   According to the SFC architecture described in figure 2 of [I-D.
   jiang-sfc-arch] and figure 2 of [I-D. quinn-sfc-arch], SFC can be
   categorized into two abstraction layers, that is, service function
   layer and SFC forwarding layer. In the service function layer, a
   service function chain actually is a service function graph, where a
   service function is connected to another service function one by one
   in sequence. In the SFC forwarding layer, service functions are
   further attached to SFF nodes thus form a more detailed forwarding
   graph. As defects can be located on either service functions or SFF
   nodes, it is critical to trace route both service functions and SFF
   nodes to detect and isolate any defects for SFC.

   In order to trace route of a service function chain, different layers
   of service function chain can be monitored:

   o Service-function-layer, that is, only SF identifiers can be set as
      the destination MEP in the trace route request and response
      messages. The trace routing operation collects all the SFs'
      identifiers along an SFC path. By comparing this SF list with the
      pre-configured service function graph, an operator could determine
      whether there is any fault in the SF connectivity and locate the
      defect on an SF when there are any of them.






Jiang and et al        Expires April 27, 2015                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft            SFC Fault Management            October 2014


   o SFC-forwarding-layer, that is, both SF identifiers and SFF can be
      set as the destination MEP in the trace route request and response
      messages.  The trace routing operation collects all the SFs'
      identifiers and SFF identifiers along an SFC path. By comparing
      this SF and SFF list with the pre-configured SFC forwarding graph,
      an operator could determine whether there is any fault in the
      forwarding layer and locate the defect on an SFF or an SF.

   Furthermore, two different mechanisms may be used to trace route a
   service function chain:

   o TTL mechanism

   Similar to the IP trace route, the detection node launches a number
   of trace request messages in sequence to detect the fault in a
   specific path, the TTL of request message is set successively to 1,
   2, ..., and so on.

   The trace route request will pass the SFs along the service function
   graph, and each SF will decrease the TTL value by 1.

   A trace route reply message will be generated and send back to the
   launcher when the resulted TTL is equal to zero.

   In this way, the launcher of trace routing can get the list of SFs
   that the trace route request message passes by parsing all the trace
   route reply messages, and isolate the fault location if there is any.



   o record route mechanism

   The detection node launches a single trace route request message, and
   this message is transported over the specific SFC path.

   When the trace route request message is received by an SF in the SFC
   path, the SF adds its SF identifier to the end of an SF list carried
   in the message. Moreover, a trace route reply message should be
   generated and sent back to the launcher, and the new record route SF
   list MUST be copied to the trace route reply message.

   In this way, the launcher of trace routing can get the list of SFs
   that the trace route request message passes by parsing all the trace
   route reply messages, and isolate the fault location if there is any.

3.2.1. MEP sending an SFC Trace Request

   In general, MEG End Points (MEPs) are the source and sink points of a
   MEG for SFC OAM. An MEP initiates a trace route request packet to
   detect and track any fault in a Service Function Chain.
   An SFC Trace route request packet is an SFC trace route request
   message encapsulated with an SFC Header. The SFC header is set as
   described in [I-D.niu-sfc-mechanism] and flag O MUST be set to 1.
   The SFC OAM message is further set as follows:
   - The message type MUST be set to 2.
   - The Sender's Handle MUST be set to the sender's identifier.
   - The Receiver's Handle can be set to the exit SFF's identifier.


3.2.2. SFF processing an SFC Trace Route Request

   When an SFF receives a trace route request packet with O flag being
   set in SFC header, it firstly adds its identifier to the end of the
   record route list in the trace request. It then performs service
   forwarding function, and sends the new trace route request packet to
   the next SF or next SFF.

   Furthermore, the SFF sends a trace reply packet back to the source
   MEP with a copy of the new record route SF list.



3.2.3. Service Function treating an SFC Trace Request

   An SF can only be configured as an MIP in an MEG of SFC. When an SF
   (being an MIP) receives a trace request packet with OAM flag being
   set in SFC header from an SFF, it only sends it back to the SFF
   transparently.



3.2.4. MEP receiving an SFC Trace Reply

   An MEP should only process an SFC trace reply packet in response to
   an SFC trace request that it has sent. Thus, upon receipt of an SFC
   trace reply packet, an MEP should try to match the trace reply packet
   with a trace request that it has previously sent, by checking the
   corresponding path identifier and Sequence Number in the SFC OAM
   packets. If no match is found, then the MEP MUST drop the trace reply
   packet silently.

   Since each SFF in the SFC path will send a trace reply packet when
   the trace request packet passes it, a source MEP will receive a
   sequence of trace reply packets from SFFs (other than the MEP itself)
   along the SFC path. Thus, the source MEP can get the full service
   topology and SFC path if there is no defect in the SFC data plane,
   and could detect and locate the data plane defects if there are any
   of them.
