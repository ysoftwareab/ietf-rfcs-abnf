Abstract

   There is wide interest in the technology for interconnecting content
   distribution networks (CDNs), variously called "content peering" or
   "CDN peering".  A common vocabulary helps the process of discussing
   such interconnection and interoperation. This document introduces
   CDNs and CDN peering, and proposes elements for such a common
   vocabulary.

1. Introduction

   Content distribution networks, or CDNs, are of increasing importance
   to the overall architecture of the Web.  This document presents a
   vocabulary for use in developing technology for interconnecting
   CDNs. By analogy with peering of IP networks, this interconnection
   is sometimes called "content peering," or (somewhat more accurately)
   "peering of CDNs". Section 2 describes content distribution, CDNs,
   and the motivation for peering of CDNs in some more detail.  Section
   3 introduces the terms used for elements of a CDN and explains how
   those terms are used. Section 5 deals with CDN peering, introducing
   the terms and explaining how those terms are used. The remainder of
   the document notes various operational and security considerations
   that are relevant to CDN peering.

   The terminology in this document builds from the previous taxonomy
   of web caching and replication [2]. In particular, we have attempted
   to avoid the use of the common terms "proxies" or "caches" in favor
   of the better-defined terms "caching proxy," "reverse caching
   proxy," and "server accelerator."

   The sections defining terms are organized alphabetically, which is
   appropriate for reference but which makes them difficult to read the
   first time. Rather than reading the document from beginning to end,
   the authors recommend that the first-time reader skip past the
   sections defining terms to the following sections with examples,
   referring back to the definitions as necessary.

   The interested reader is also referred to [3], which enumerates
   scenarios for content-peering-related interactions; [4], which
   describes models for accounting and associated issues; and [5],
   which gives an overall architecture of the elements for CDN peering.

2. CDNs and Other Content Architectures

   A CDN (content distribution network or content delivery network) is
   an architecture of Web-based network elements, arranged for
   efficient delivery of digital content. The first important use of
   CDNs was for the distribution of heavily-requested graphic files
   (such as GIF files on the home pages of popular servers). However,
   both in principle and increasingly in practice, a CDN can support
   the delivery of any digital content -- including various forms of
   streaming media.

   A number of CDN services have been built and offered commercially.
   In addition, a number of hardware and software vendors have
   developed products that enable the construction of a CDN with
   "off-the-shelf" parts.  The proliferation of CDNs and CDN
   capabilities gives rise to interest in interconnecting CDNs and
   finding ways for distinct CDNs to cooperate for better overall
   service.

   In this section we describe the problem of content distribution, the
   use of server farms and server accelerators to improve the
   performance of content distribution, the contrast between CDNs and
   those solutions, and what makes a CDN valuable.

2.1 Problem Description

   Abstractly, the "content distribution problem" is to arrange a
   rendezvous between a content source at an origin server and a
   content sink at a viewer's client. In the trivial case, the
   rendezvous mechanism is that every client sends every request
   directly to the origin server named in the host part of the URL
   identifying the content.

   As the audience for the content source grows, so do the demands on
   the origin server. There are a variety of ways in which the trivial
   system can be modified for better performance.  The single logical
   server may in fact be a large "farm" of server machines behind a
   switch. Both caching proxies and reverse caching proxies can be
   deployed between the client and server, so that requests can be
   satisfied by some cache instead of by the server.

   All of these techniques are useful, but have limits. Server farms
   and server accelerators can improve the scalability of the origin
   server. However, since the multiple servers and server accelerators
   are typically deployed near the origin server, they do little to
   improve performance problems that are due to congestion.  Caching
   proxies can improve performance problems due to congestion (since
   they are situated near the clients) but they cache objects based on
   client demand -- so they may not help the distribution load of a

   given origin server.

   Thus, a content provider with a popular content source can find that
   it has to invest in large server farms, load balancing, and
   high-bandwidth connections to keep up with demand. Even with those
   investments, the user experience for viewers may still be relatively
   poor due to congestion in the network as a whole.

2.2 Introduction to CDNs

   A CDN essentially combines the cache-management approach of reverse
   caching proxies with the network placement of (forward) caching
   proxies. A CDN has multiple replicas of each content item being
   hosted. A request from a browser for a single content item is
   directed to a "good" replica, where "good" usually means that the
   item is served to the client quickly compared to the time it would
   take fetch it from the origin server, with appropriate integrity and
   consistency. Static information about geographic locations and
   network connectivity is usually not sufficient to do a good job of
   choosing a replica. Instead, a CDN typically incorporates dynamic
   information about network conditions and load on the replicas,
   directing requests so as to balance the load. 

   Compared to using servers and caches in a single data center, a CDN
   is a relatively complex system encompassing multiple points of
   presence, in locations that may be geographically far apart. 
   Operating a CDN is not easy for a content provider, since a content
   provider wants to focus its resources on developing high-value
   content, not on managing network infrastructure.  Instead, a more
   typical configuration is that a network service provider builds and
   operates a CDN, offering a content distribution service to a number
   of content providers.

   A CDN enables a service provider to act on behalf of the content
   provider to deliver copies of origin server content from multiple
   diverse locations. The increase in number and diversity of locations
   is intended to improve download times and thus improve the user
   experience.  A CDN has some combination of a mapping infrastructure,
   a content-delivery infrastructure, and a distribution
   infrastructure.  The content-delivery infrastructure consists of a
   set of "surrogate" servers [2] that deliver copies of content to
   sets of users. The mapping infrastructure consists of mechanisms
   that move a client toward a rendezvous with a surrogate. The
   distribution infrastructure consists of mechanisms that move content
   from the origin server to the surrogates.  An effective CDN serves
   frequently-accessed content from a surrogate that is "best suited"
   for a given client.

Internet-Draft                   CDNPM                     November 2000


2.3 Extending Reach & Scale

   There are two fundamental elements that give a CDN value:
   outsourcing infrastructure and improved content delivery. A CDN
   allows multiple surrogates to act on behalf of an orgin server,
   therefore removing the delivery of content from a centralized site
   to multiple and (usually) highly distributed sites. We refer to
   increased aggregate infrastructure size as "scale." In addition, a
   CDN can be constructed with copies of content near to end users,
   overcoming issues of network size, network congestion, and network
   failures.  We refer to increased diversity of content locations as
   "reach."

   In a typical (non-peered) CDN, a single service provider operates
   the request mappers, the surrogates, and the content distributors.
   In addition, that service provider establishes (business)
   relationships with content publishers and acts on behalf of their
   origin sites to provide a distributed delivery system.  The value of
   that CDN to a content provider is a combination of its scale and its
   reach.

   There are limits to how large any one network's scale and reach can
   be.  Increasing either scale or reach is ultimately limited by the
   cost of equipment, the space available for deploying equipment,
   and/or the demand for that scale/reach of infrastructure. Sometimes
   a particular audience is tied to a single service provider or a
   small set of providers by constraints of technology, economics, or
   law. Other times, a network provider may be able to manage
   surrogates and a distribution system, but may have no direct
   relationship with content providers. Such a provider wants to have a
   means of affiliating their delivery and distribution infrastructure
   with other parties who have content to distribute. 

   CDN peering allows different CDNs to share resources so as to
   provide larger scale and/or reach to each participant than they
   could otherwise achieve.

   As used in this document, "peering" is interconnection among two or
   more separately-administered content networks. There are several
   other potential meanings for "peering" that are not intended. For
   example, interconnection of similar-sized networks could be seen as
   interconnecting "peers."  This document does not mean to imply a
   requirement that the interconnected networks be similar in size or
   capability. For example, a publisher might choose to have just
   enough of a CDN so that they could make use of several other
   "industrial strength" CDNs, without any intent of building a global
   distribution network themselves. Another example is the distinction
   between "peering" and "transit," where the former means a
   settlement-free economic relationship and the latter means that one

   network is paying the other.  This document does not mean to imply a
   requirement for any particular economic or business relationship
   among the interconnected networks.

3. CDN Model Terms

   This section consists of the definitions of a number of terms used
   to refer to roles, participants, and objects involved in CDNs.

   ACCOUNTING 
      Measurement and recording of DISTRIBUTION and DELIVERY
      activities, especially when the information recorded is
      ultimately used as a basis for the subsequent transfer of money,
      goods, or obligations.

   ACCOUNTING SYSTEM 
      A collection of NETWORK ELEMENTS that supports ACCOUNTING for a
      single CDN.

   AUTHORITATIVE MAPPING SYSTEM 
      The MAPPING SYSTEM that is the correct/final authority for a
      particular item of CONTENT. 

   CDN 
      Content Delivery Network or Content Distribution Network.  A
      collection of NETWORK ELEMENTS arranged for more effective
      delivery of CONTENT to CLIENTS.  Typically a CDN consists of a
      MAPPING SYSTEM, SURROGATES, a DIRECTING SYSTEM, and an ACCOUNTING
      SYSTEM.

   CLIENT 
      The origin of a REQUEST and the destination of the corresponding
      delivered CONTENT.

   CONTENT 
      Digital data resources. [Editor note: discussion is currently
      active about correct alignment between resource/entity/variant
      model of HTTP and "content".] One important form of CONTENT with
      additional constraints on DISTRIBUTION and DELIVERY is CONTINUOUS
      MEDIA.

   CONTENT SIGNAL 
      A message delivered through a DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM that specifies
      information about an item of CONTENT. For example, a CONTENT
      SIGNAL can indicate that the ORIGIN has a new version of some
      piece of CONTENT.

   CONTINUOUS MEDIA 
      CONTENT where there is a timing relationship between source and
      sink; that is, the sink must reproduce the timing relationship
      that existed at the source. The most common examples of
      CONTINUOUS MEDIA are audio and motion video. CONTINUOUS MEDIA can
      be real-time (interactive), where there is a "tight" timing

Internet-Draft                   CDNPM                     November 2000


      relationship between source and sink, or streaming (playback),
      where the relationship is less strict. 

   DELIVERY 
      The activity of presenting a PUBLISHER's CONTENT for consumption
      by a CLIENT. Contrast with DISTRIBUTION and MAPPING.

   DISTRIBUTION 
      The activity of moving a PUBLISHER's CONTENT from its ORIGIN to
      one or more SURROGATEs. DISTRIBUTION can happen either in
      anticipation of a SURROGATE receiving a REQUEST (pre-positioning)
      or in response to a SURROGATE receiving a REQUEST (fetching on
      demand). Contrast with DELIVERY and MAPPING.

   DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM 
      A collection of NETWORK ELEMENTS that support DISTRIBUTION for a
      single CDN. The DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM also propagates CONTENT
      SIGNALs.

   MAPPING 
      The activity of mapping a REQUEST from a CLIENT to a suitable
      SURROGATE.

   MAPPING SYSTEM 
      A collection of NETWORK ELEMENTS that support MAPPING for a
      single CDN.

   NETWORK ELEMENT 
      A device or system that affects the processing of network
      messages.

   ORIGIN 
      The point at which CONTENT first enters a DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.
      The ORIGIN for any item of CONTENT is the server or set of
      servers at the "core" of the distribution, holding the "master"
      or "authoritative" copy of that CONTENT.

   PUBLISHER 
      The party that ultimately controls the content and its
      distribution. 

   REACHABLE SURROGATES 
      The collection of SURROGATES that can be contacted via a
      particular DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM or MAPPING SYSTEM.

   REQUEST 
      A message identifying a particular item of CONTENT to be
      delivered. [Editor Note: Brad Cain recommends distinguishing
      MAPPING REQUEST from CONTENT REQUEST. Does this make the model

      too closely tied to DNS-style mapping? To be discussed.]

   SURROGATE 
      A delivery server, other than the ORIGIN. Receives a mapped
      REQUEST and delivers the corresponding CONTENT. Note: This
      definition has a narrower semantic context than the more
      generally used term defined in [2].

4. CDN Examples and Commentary

   This section uses the terms of the previous to explain concepts of
   CDNs and content. 

4.1 Understanding CDNs

   With the elements defined so far, we can outline the operation of a
   "typical" CDN at a high level. The CLIENT's REQUEST enters a MAPPING
   SYSTEM, and the ORIGIN's CONTENT enters a DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. Note
   that the relative timing of these events is unspecified. Both
   systems (MAPPING and DISTRIBUTION) converge on SURROGATES, which are
   non-ORIGIN servers of CONTENT.  Effectively, the DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
   is moving CONTENT out to SURROGATES, and the MAPPING SYSTEM is then
   taking advantage of that distribution of CONTENT.

   [Editor Note: Could change this description to deal with MAPPING
   REQUESTS and CONTENT REQUESTS.]

4.2 Understanding content structure

   The model defines CONTENT as well as a subsidiary concept:
   CONTINUOUS MEDIA.

   Any identifiable resource of digital data is an item of CONTENT. So
   CONTENT is the most generic description of what is transported and
   served up by a CDN.

   In many cases, an item of CONTENT can be delivered by a CDN without
   concern about maintaining timing relationships. However, there are
   some forms of CONTENT where it is critical that some timing
   relationships be met. The model refers to those forms of CONTENT as
   CONTINUOUS MEDIA.

5. Peering Model Terms

   This section consists of the definitions of a number of terms used
   to refer to roles, participants, and objects involved in peering
   CDNs.

   ACCOUNTING ADVERTISEMENT 
      ADVERTISEMENT from a CDN's ACCOUNTING PEERING SYSTEM about the
      collections of CONTENT for which that CDN requires ACCOUNTING
      information.

   ACCOUNTING PEERING 
      Interconnection of two or more ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS so as to enable
      the exchange of information between them. The form of ACCOUNTING
      PEERING required may depend on the nature of the NEGOTIATED
      RELATIONSHIP between the peering parties -- in particular, on the
      value of the economic exchanges anticipated.

   ACCOUNTING PEERING SYSTEM 
      See PEERING SYSTEM.

   ADVERTISEMENT 
      Information about available resources, exchanged among PEERING
      SYSTEMS. Types of ADVERTISEMENT include MAPPING ADVERTISEMENTS,
      DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISEMENTS and ACCOUNTING ADVERTISEMENTS.

   BILLING ORGANIZATION 
      An entity that operates an ACCOUNTING SYSTEM to support billing
      within a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP with a PUBLISHER.

   CONTENT PEERING GATEWAY (CPG) 
      A point through which a CDN can be peered with others through one
      or more kinds of peering. A CPG may be the point of contact for
      DISTRIBUTION PEERING, MAPPING PEERING, and/or ACCOUNTING PEERING,
      and thus may incorporate some or all of the corresponding PEERING
      SYSTEMs for the CDN.

   DISTRIBUTING CDN 
      A CDN that does not have a NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP with the
      PUBLISHER for the CONTENT being delivered.

   DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISEMENT 
      An ADVERTISEMENT from a CDN's DISTRIBUTION PEERING SYSTEM
      describing the availability of collections of CONTENT via the
      CDN's DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.

   DISTRIBUTION PEERING 
      Interconnection of two or more DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS so as to
      propagate CONTENT SIGNALS and copies of CONTENT to groups of

      SURROGATES.

   DISTRIBUTION PEERING SYSTEM 
      See PEERING SYSTEM.

   INTER-CDN 
      Related to an activity that involves more than one CDN. Contrast
      with INTRA-CDN.

   INTRA-CDN 
      Related to an activity within a single CDN. Contrast with
      INTER-CDN.

   MAPPING ADVERTISEMENT 
      An ADVERTISEMENT from a CDN's MAPPING PEERING SYSTEM describing
      the availability of collections of CONTENT via that CDN's MAPPING
      SYSTEM.

   MAPPING PEERING 
      Interconnection of two or more MAPPING SYSTEMS so as to increase
      the number of REACHABLE SURROGATES for at least one of the
      interconnected systems.

   MAPPING PEERING SYSTEM 
      See PEERING SYSTEM.

   NEGOTIATED RELATIONSHIP 
      A relationship whose terms and conditions are partially or
      completely established outside the context of CDN peering
      protocols.

   PEERING SYSTEM 
      A collection of NETWORK ELEMENTS supporting some form of
      interconnected operation among two or more CDNs. Examples (not
      separately defined): ACCOUNTING PEERING SYSTEM, DISTRIBUTION
      PEERING SYSTEM, MAPPING PEERING SYSTEM.

   REMOTE CDN 
      A CDN able to deliver CONTENT for a particular REQUEST that is
      not the AUTHORITATIVE MAPPING SYSTEM for that REQUEST.

6. Peering Examples and Commentary

   This section uses the terms of the previous to explain concepts of
   CDN peering. 

6.1 Understanding Peering

   The model offers a number of ways in which different CDNs can be
   interconnected.  An arrangement of interconnected MAPPING SYSTEMS is
   called MAPPING PEERING. Analogously, interconnected DISTRIBUTION
   SYSTEMS give rise to DISTRIBUTION PEERING, and interconnected
   ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS give rise to ACCOUNTING PEERING. The
   communicating elements on each side are referred to as PEERING
   SYSTEMS. So when two or more DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS may be
   interconnected by PEERING, it is actually the DISTRIBUTION PEERING
   SYSTEMS that are communicating with each other to accomplish the
   exchange of information required.  A CONTENT PEERING GATEWAY (CPG)
   is a generic term used in the model for one or more PEERING SYSTEMS
   when it is not important to distinguish the PEERING SYSTEM or form
   of PEERING involved.

   CPGs exchange ADVERTISEMENTS. There are three main kinds of
   ADVERTISEMENT: ACCOUNTING ADVERTISEMENTS, MAPPING ADVERTISEMENTS,
   and DISTRIBUTION ADVERTISEMENTS. An ACCOUNTING ADVERTISEMENT
   describes a collection of URLs for which a given ACCOUNTING SYSTEM
   wants to receive accounting information when the content is
   delivered. [Editor note: is accounting information potentially
   collected for MAPPING or DISTRIBUTION as well?] A MAPPING
   ADVERTISEMENT describes a collection of URLs whose content can be
   delivered by MAPPING through the corresponding CDN.  A DISTRIBUTION
   ADVERTISEMENT describes the service level(s) available from a CDN's
   SURROGATES (as a whole) to some collection of CLIENT addresses.

6.2 Content Signalling

   CDNs operate on behalf of PUBLISHERs and ORIGINs and therefore must
   provide accurate, up-to-date copies of CONTENT. A CDN DISTRIBUTION
   SYSTEM may deliver CONTENT SIGNALS to relevant SURROGATES when
   appropriate. In the presence of peered distribution where the peered
   systems support such signals, CONTENT SIGNALS must be propagated to
   each SURROGATE with a copy of the relevant CONTENT.

7. Operational Considerations

   [Editor's Note: Consider problem of incorrect advertisements of
   content or service levels. Need to ensure that there are means
   within the protocol or recommended practices so that CDNs aren't
   encouraged to pull traffic they can't really handle.]

8. Security Considerations

   [Editor's Note: Discuss the issues of delegated authority and trust
   between CDNs and Origin Servers.]

   [Editor's Note: Discuss man-in-the-middle and denial-of-service
   attacks on peered CDNs.]

   [Editor's Note: Include reference to security section of
   architecture document rather than restating issues here?]
