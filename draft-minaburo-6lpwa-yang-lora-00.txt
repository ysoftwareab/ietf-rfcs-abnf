1.  Introduction

   This document provides a YANG module description for managing a LoRa
   endpoints.

   SemTech [LoRa] (c) is a low-rate, low-power, long-range radio
   technology.  It could be used as a base radio technology for building
   Low-Rate Wide-Area Networks (LR-WAN), also known as LPWA (Low-Power
   Wide Area).  SemTech [LoRa] (c) has the following characteristics:

   o  Works in narrow, license-free (ISM) bands with good propagation
      properties (< 1GHz)

   o  Low- to very-low throughput (270 bps--200 kbps)

   o  Low-power operation (25 mW in Europe)

   o  Far-Reaching communication capabilities (20 km with line-of-sight,
      several km in urban environment)

   o  Strong channel access restrictions (1% to 10% duty cycling)

   The management of LoRa-based devices can be done through a standard
   approach, compatible with the best network-operator practices, namely
   NETCONF or RESTCONF.  A formal definition of the parameters and the
   values to be managed is thus required, which can be done with the
   YANG module language.  The following document presents a YANG module
   definition for managing a LoRa-based end-device.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  LoRa Data Model

   The data model has the following structure for Lora configuration:


   +- RW ietf-lora
       +- RW Lora
          +- RW Mode
          |   +- RW Channel Bandwidth      enumeration
          |   +- RW Coding Rate            enumeration
          |   +- RW Spreading Factor       int8
          +- Physical Layer
          |   +- RW Preamblelength         int32
          |   +- RW Channel Frequency Range  enumeration
          |   +- RW Channel                int8
          |   +- RW SymbolTimeout          int32
          +- MAC Layer
              +- RW FrPayloadEncryption    boolean
              +- RW Delay                  int32
              +- RW FixlengthPayloadOn     boolean


   The data model defines a state container Mode which include the three
   principal characteristics of the LoRA interface which determine the
   parameters of the channel

3.  LoRa YANG module

   This model imports typedefs from [RFC6991].
