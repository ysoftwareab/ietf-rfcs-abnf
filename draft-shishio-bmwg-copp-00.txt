Internet-Draft      Benchmarking Methodology for CoPP       October 2015


1.  Introduction

   COntrol Plane Policing (CoPP) which is defined as RFC6192 to protect
   router's control plane from undesired or malicious traffic.  Some
   modern router implemented this RFC6192 mechanism as the default.
   Also some router can support RFC6192 by configuration.

   Ethernet based service has been widely deployed for both consumer and
   business .  In some case , service provider has to converge customer
   network directly without CPE.  There is ARP/NDP and broadcast/
   multicast protocol in the segment , therefore service provider
   becomes carefully for protection of router's control plane.

   This document provides methodology to confirm implementation of CoPP.


2.  Test setup

2.1.  Topology

   The DUT need to at least 3 interfaces to connect Attack Emulator/
   Uplink Router/Traffic Generator.

   Basic network topology is here

                            +------------------------+
                            |                        |

                            |                        |
                            |   +----------------+   |
                            |   | Router Control |   |
                            |   |     Plane      |   |

                            |     Router Control     |
                            |    Plane Protection    |
            +-----------+   |          | |           |
            |  Attack   |   |   +------+ +-------+   |
            | Emulator  |---|---[                |   |
            +-----------+   |   |   Forwarding   |   |    +----------+
                       +----|---[     Plane      ]---|----|  Router  |---+
                       |    |   +----------------+   |    +----------+   |
                       |    +------------------------+                   |

2.2.  Network

   Configure applicable network parameter on both DUT and uplink router
   such as IGP/BGP.  Send traffic from traffic generator to transit
   between DUT and Router.  If needed configure DUT to protect Control
   plane. section-3.1 of RFC6192 would be reference.


3.  Test procedure

   Attack emulator sends packets to DUT to confirm influence of CoPP.
   section-3.1 of RFC6192 describes example of CoPP.  It completely
   depends on network environment but it can be categorized in the
   following section.

3.1.  Attack Packet

3.1.1.  Typical

   fragment/ip option/ ICMP ttl exceed

   Expect Action: drop/rate-limit

3.1.2.  Routing Protocol from trust networkl

   BGP/OSPF

   Expect Action: accept but rate-limit would be prefered

3.1.3.  Routing Protocol from untrust networkl

   BGP/OSPF

   Expect Action: drop

3.1.4.  Control Packet from trust network

   ARP/NDP/ICMP/ICMPv6

   Expect Action: accept but rate-limit would be prefered

3.1.5.  Control Packet from un-trust network

   ARP/NDP/ICMP/ICMPv6

   Expect Action: drop

3.1.6.  Management Packet from trust network

   NTP/SSH/Telnet/Radius/DNS/DHCP

   Expect Action: accept/rate-limit

3.1.7.  Management Packet from un-trust network

   NTP/SSH/Telnet/Radius/DNS/DHCP

   Expect Action: drop

3.1.8.  undefined packets

   IPX/Apple talk

   Expect Action: drop

   The section will be update more detail(src ip/dst ip and packet type)

   Attack duration must be higher than routing protocol hold timer
   between DUT and router.  Transit packets should be non drop.


4.  Test Result

   Test Result report needs these information.

   +--------+----------------+----------------+------------------------+
   | Attack | Attack         |         Attack |     Loss of packets on |
   |        | rate[pps/bps]  |  duration time |      traffic generator |
   +--------+----------------+----------------+------------------------+
   | -      | -              |              - |                      - |
   +--------+----------------+----------------+------------------------+


5.  Acknowledgements

   TBD


6.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA Action is requested at this time.

   There is no additional consideration from RFC6192.
