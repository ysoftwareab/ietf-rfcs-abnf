Abstract

   This document registers a media feature tag 'xmlns', per RFC 2506,
   intended for use in a Content-features features header to indicate
   the XML namespaces used in an XML document.  This information
   augments MIME content-type information, providing a finer granularity
   of content description for XML documents.

Internet-Draft                xmlns feature                 January 2002


1. Introduction

   MIME Content-Type identifiers have proven very useful as tools for
   describing homogeneous information.  They do not fare as well at
   describing content which is unpredictably heterogeneous.  XML
   documents may be homogeneous, but are also frequently heterogeneous.
   It is not difficult to create, for instance, an XHTML [25] document
   which also contains RDF [19] metadata, MathML [20] equations,
   hypertext using XLink [22], and SVG [21] graphics.  XSLT [17]
   stylesheets routinely include information in both the XSLT namespace
   and in the namespace of the format resulting from proper execution of
   the stylesheet.

   This document specifies a Media Feature which identifies the URIs
   used as XML namespaces [14] in a given XML document.  While a list of
   namespaces cannot tell a recipient application everything about the
   use of those namespaces and there interactions in a given document,
   it can provide a baseline understanding.

   A program may be better able to choose among a set of XSLT
   stylesheets if it knows the namespaces of the results they generate,
   or a renderer may take advantage of foreknowledge to begin setting up
   components before content actually arrives.  Processors working with
   SOAP [18] envelopes may find it useful to know what they will be
   facing inside the envelope.  Applications faced with "unknown" XML
   namespaces may want to attempt to download RDDL [16] documents to
   collect information on how to process them.  Applications may also
   choose to reject documents containing unknown namespaces.

   This feature is designed primarily to be used with the XML Media
   Types defined in RFC 3023 [12].  By providing additional information
   about the content of the document beyond its overall type, it
   provides XML applications with a more comprehensive view of
   information they may (or may not) wish to process, potentially
   avoiding wasted parsing and processing.

Internet-Draft                xmlns feature                 January 2002


2. Registration

   Media feature tag name: xmlns

   ASN.1 identifier associated with feature tag: New assignment by IANA

   Summary of the media feature indicated by this feature tag: This
      feature tag is used to identify XML namespaces either contained in
      a given document or processable by a given recipient.

   Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: The feature tag
      must contain a String conforming to the RFC 2396 [4] syntax for
      URI references, as restricted by plenary [15].  URI references
      must be absolute.

   The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
   applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms: Any
      protocol that exchanges XML-formatted information in MIME
      encapsulation

      Examples of typical use:

      For an XHTML document containing SVG, MathML, SMIL, and XLink
      content:

        Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml
        Content-features: (|
           (xmlns="http//www.w3.org/1999/xhtml")
           (xmlns="http//www.w3.org/2000/svg")
           (xmlns="http//www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML")
           (xmlns="http//www.w3.org/2001/SMIL20/")
           (xmlns="http//www.w3.org/1999/xlink")
        )

      Or, using multiple Content-features headings:

        Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml
        Content-features (xmlns="http//www.w3.org/1999/xhtml")
        Content-features (xmlns="http//www.w3.org/2000/svg")
        Content-features (xmlns="http//www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML")
        Content-features (xmlns="http//www.w3.org/2001/SMIL20/")
        Content-features (xmlns="http//www.w3.org/1999/xlink")

Internet-Draft                xmlns feature                 January 2002


      For an application indicating that it accepts SMIL, XHTML, or SVG
      content:

     (| (xmlns="http//www.w3.org/2001/SMIL20/");q=1.0
        (xmlns="http//www.w3.org/1999/xhtml");q=0.9
        (xmlns="http//www.w3.org/2000/svg");q=0.8
        )

      Applications that want to specify combinations of namespaces they
      consider acceptable may do so using combinations of & and |, and
      may also mix the xmlns feature with other media features, as
      described in RFC 2533 [6].

   Related standards or documents: Namespaces in XML [14], XML Media
      Types [12]

   Considerations particular to use in individual applications,
   protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms: None

   Interoperability considerations: None.

   Security considerations: If it is known that there is a security bug
      in the handling of a particular namespace in a particular
      environment, knowing that a device can accept that namespace may
      slightly help an attacker.

   Additional information: None

   Name(s) & email address(es) of person(s) to contact for further
   information: Simon St.Laurent <simonstl@simonstl.com>

   Intended usage COMMON

   Author/Change controller: IETF

3. Registration issues

3.1 General interest to the Internet Community

   While XML processing may generally seem like something specific to
   the XML community, XML's reach is growing rapidly.  XML is now in
   regular use for Web Services (XML-RPC, SOAP), vector graphics (SVG),
   mathematics (MathML), instant messaging (Jabber), information
   transformation (XSLT), and a wide variety of other projects.

   Because of this general and growing interest, this document
   recommends registering the 'xmlns' feature in the IETF tree per RFC
   2506 [5].

3.2 Namespaces as media

   Namespaces are not strictly presentational media information, as are
   many of the previously registered media features.  They do, however,
   define the set of tools used to present information, much as the type
   [10], charset [11], and language [11] media features do.

3.3 Security Considerations

   Security considerations for this registration are listed in the
   registration above.  Considerations for Media Features in general are
   described in RFC 2506.

3.4 IANA Considerations

   Section 2 of this document calls for the registration of a media
   feature tag, per RFC 2506.
