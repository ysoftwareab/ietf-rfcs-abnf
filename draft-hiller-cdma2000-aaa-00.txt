2.  Abstract

This draft specifies cdma2000 wireless data AAA requirements associated
with third generation wireless architecture that supports roaming among
service providers for traditional PPP and Mobile IP services. The
architecture is designed for use with a cellular network as an access
medium.

Sections 3, 4, present a brief high level review of the cdma2000
wireless data architecture. Section 5 presents cdma2000 AAA
requirements.

3.  Introduction

This draft specifies AAA requirements associated with a third generation
cdma2000 wireless architecture that supports roaming among service
providers for traditional PPP and Mobile IP services.  The architecture
is designed for use with a cellular network as an access medium.

Sections 3.1 and 4 present a brief, high level review of the cdma2000
wireless  data architecture as an aid to interested AAA WG members.
Section 5 presents cdma2000 AAA requirements, and is self contained
relative to the architecture review.

3.1.  Requirements language

In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST,  "MUST  NOT",  "optional",
"recommended",  "SHOULD",  and  "SHOULD  NOT",  are to be interpreted as
described in [RFC2119].

Please note that the requirements specified in this document are to be
used in evaluating AAA protocol submissions.  As such, the requirements
language refers to capabilities of these protocols; the protocol
documents will specify whether these features are required, recommended,
or optional.  For example, requiring that a protocol support
confidentiality is NOT the same thing as requiring that all protocol
traffic be encrypted.

A protocol submission is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or
more of the MUST or MUST NOT requirements for the capabilities that it
implements.  A protocol submission that satisfies all the MUST, MUST
NOT, SHOULD and SHOULD NOT requirements for its capabilities is said to
be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST and MUST
NOT requirements but not all the SHOULD or SHOULD NOT requirements for

its protocols is said to be "conditionally compliant."

4.  General Service Requirements

   o Provide service during subscriber visiting between wireless
     networks systems while maintaining a formal customer-service
     provider relation with only one wireless service provider.
   o Support Traditional PPP and Mobile IP services:
      o Support dynamic and static home address assignments for
        Mobile IP
      o Support a Home Agent in the mobile's home wireless network,
        home ISP, or private network.
      o Support IP Security on the Mobile IP tunnel between Foreign
        Agent and Home Agent, in order to avoid the overhead of a
        voluntary tunnel on the radio interface.
   o Provide robust authentication, authorization and accounting
     services (AAA):
      o Provide separation of airlink resource AAA services and data
        resource AAA services.
      o Authenticate and authorize a mobile based on an IMSI and an
        NAI. The architecture allows for a carrier to determine if
        billing is based on the IMSI or the NAI.
      o Support optional AAA broker services between wireless
        carriers and between wireless carriers and other external
        data networks.
      o Allow for distribution of specific Mobile IP security key
        information to support home agent assignment, fast handoff,
        and fast HA-FA authentication assignment during registration.
   o Provide QoS

5.  High Level Architecture

The high level architecture is shown in Figure 1.  The six major
entities that compose the network are the Home Agent, the PDSN, the AAA
Server, the Radio Network, the HLR/VLR, and Mobile Client.

6.  AAA Requirements


6.1.  Core AAA Requirements

The following is a summary of cdma2000 AAA specific requirements. In
these requirements, the serving network and home network may or may not
have a direct business relationship. In such cases in which there is not
a direct business relationship, service may be supported indirectly via
broker.

   o Authenticate and authorize a user NAI in a roaming environment.
     The NAI is obtained via CHAP (for traditional PPP service) or a
     Foreign Agent Challenge (for Mobile IP service). A shared secret
     exists between the mobile and its HAAA. The FAC will typically be
     computed in a manner  consistent with CHAP.
   o Transport wireless data attributes from the home network to the
     Serving network. This may often take the form of a user profile.
   o Encrypt or sign one or more AVPs in an AAA message between home,
     serving network, or some broker across multiple AAA server hops.
   o Support a reliable AAA transport mechanism.
      o This transport mechanism will be able indicate to an AAA
        application that a message was delivered to the next peer AAA
        application or that a time out occurred.
      o Retransmission is controlled by the reliable AAA transport
        mechanism, and not by lower layer protocols such as TCP.
      o Even if the AAA message is to be forwarded, or the message's
        options or semantics do not conform with the AAA protocol, the
        transport mechanism will acknowledge that the peer received the
        AAA message. However, if the message fails to pass
        authentication, it will not be acknowledged.
      o Acknowledgements should be allowed to be piggybacked in AAA
        messages
      o The reliable transport mechanism features shall have the
        capability to detect silent failures of the AAA peer or path to
        the AAA peer, to manage failure on a proactive basis.

INTERNET-DRAFT        CDMA2000 Requirements for AAA     25 February 2000


   o Transport a digital certificate in an AAA message, in order to
     minimize the number of round trips associated with AAA
     transactions. Note: This requirement applies to AAA applications
     and not mobile stations.
   o Support both proxy and non-proxy brokers, where non-proxy brokers
     imply the broker terminates an entire request and initiates a new
     request. AAA brokers should have the capability to modify certain
     parts of AAA messages whereby to operate to in non-proxy or proxy
     environments.
   o Provide message integrity and identity authentication on a per hop
     (AAA node) basis.
   o Support replay protection and optional non-repudiation
     capabilities for all authorization and accounting messages. The
     AAA protocol must provide the capability for accounting messages
     to be matched with prior authorization messages.
   o Support accounting via both bilateral arrangements and via broker
     AAA servers providing accounting clearinghouse and reconciliation
     between serving and home networks. There is an explicit agreement
     that if the private network or home ISP authenticates the mobile
     station requesting service, then the private network or home ISP
     network also agrees to reconcile charges with the home service
     provider or broker.  Real time accounting must be supported.
   o Provides security between AAA servers, and between AAA server and
     PDSN or HA via IP security.

6.2.  Mobile IP Specific Requirements and AAA


6.2.1.  Mobile IP Security Discussion

Three Mobile IP security extensions are defined in RFC 2002:

     . HA - FA
     . MN - FA
     . HA - MN

Therefore, Mobile IP and IPsec security models differ in that Mobile IP
provides its own authentication mechanisms calculated within the Mobile
IP registration procedures whereas IPsec uses IPsec AH.

The keys and SPIs associated with the MN-FA and HA-FA extensions need to
be dynamically established in a roaming wireless carrier environment.
The MN-FA extension is useful for allowing a new FA (PDSN) to quickly
authenticate a mobile using the previous foreign agent extension. The
HA-FA extension is useful for the HA to ensure that only FAs from
carrier's with roaming agreements access the HA.  The MN-HA is usually
provisioned, but for dynamic Home Agent assignment, this security
association must be dynamically created.



Hiller, et al.                Informational                     [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT        CDMA2000 Requirements for AAA     25 February 2000


It is possible to use IPsec AH between MN and FA, FA and HA, and MN and
HA. IKE may be used to establish security associations between these
entities. However, use of IKE may pose a problem for smaller mobiles and
may introduce unacceptable delays for certain applications (e.g. Voice
Over IP). The following three sections outline Mobile IP specific
functions that benefit from AAA based key distribution.

6.2.2.  Dynamic Home Agent Assignment

A visited or home AAA server will optionally be able perform dynamic HA
assignment. For dynamically assigned HA, the visited AAA server will
indicate to the home AAA server whether it supports dynamic HA
assignment in those cases in which the mobile node requests dynamic
assignment. If so indicated, the home AAA server may choose to allow the
visited AAA server to perform the HA assignment. Otherwise, the home AAA
assigns the HA.

6.2.3.  Fast Handoff

To achieve a faster handoff, the mobile may attempt to avoid an AAA
transaction with the home AAA server. To accomplish this, the mobile may
send the PDSN the Previous FA address in the RRQ message from the
mobile, along with the MN-FA authentication extension. The new PDSN
passes the Previous FA address and MN-FA authentication extension to the
visited AAA server. If the visited AAA server is able authenticate the
MN-FA authentication extension for the mobile, then the visited AAA may
be able to avoid an actual transaction to the home AAA server.

6.2.4.  HA-FA Authentication

To achieve a fast registration for the case of a mobile station with a
Home Agent, the PDSN and HA may receive from the AAA mechanism a HA-FA
key and SPI that is used to authenticate the PDSN and the HA to each
other.

6.2.5.  Key Distribution

These functions are primarily useful in a wireless environment in which
handoffs may occur rapidly (implying a need for low latency), or where
mobile devices have limited computing power. To achieve these functions,
AAA will be used to securely pass keys and SPIs between the serving
network and target network in encrypted form.  These keys are then used
for the specific functions outlined in this draft.

6.3.  IKE and AAA

The use of IKE in the cdma2000 wireless architecture requires the use of
certificates. However, the AAA servers may be able to distribute a pre-



Hiller, et al.                Informational                     [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT        CDMA2000 Requirements for AAA     25 February 2000


shared key to the Mobile IP Agents for use during Phase 1 ISAKMP
exchanges. This may lessen the need for on-line revocation checks.

6.4.  Interoperability with RADIUS

Users with a home AAA server based on RADIUS may desire to roam into a
wireless carrier network that uses "new" AAA servers based on the
requirements in this draft, and vice verse. The AAA protocol should be
designed in a way so as to make conversions to and from RADIUS messages
straight forward. This will allow for the development of gateway
processes to aid in interoperability.  Note: The features of the new AAA
protocols which are beyond the feature set of the RADIUS protocol will
not be available for users while on home or serving networks based on
RADIUS.

8.  Security Considerations

This document is very much about security. These requirements do not
require the serving and home networks to not be in the same domain nor
must they have a direct relationship. The serving network requires
authorization from the home network so that the serving network obtains
proof it will get paid for services rendered to the mobile. This implies
the home network must authenticate the user.  AAA functions must be
performed in a secure manner. The requirements contained in section 3
outline the security required.

Mobile IP supports authentication mechanisms outside IP Security.  These
mechanism may be enhanced in a cellular wireless environment by allowing
a home AAA server to distribute keys to the serving network.
Additionally, the home AAA server may be able to send a pre-shared key
to be used in Phase 1 ISAKMP security association establishment between
FA and HA. These keys would sent in encrypted form from the home network
to the serving network. As supported in the requirements contained in
section 3, the encryption could be handled via public cryptography and
certificates.

9.  IANA Considerations

This draft does not create any new number spaces for IANA
administration.
