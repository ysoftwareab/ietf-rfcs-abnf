INTERNET-DRAFT                                      BGP Tunnel Flow-Spec


1. Introduction

   BGP Flow-spec [RFC5575bis] is an extension to BGP that supports the
   dissemination of traffic flow specification rules.  It uses the BGP
   control plane to simplify the distribution of Access Control Lists
   (ACLs) and allows new filter rules to be injected to all BGP peers
   simultaneously without changing router configuration. A typical
   application of BGP Flow-spec is to automate the distribution of
   traffic filter lists to routers for Distributed Denial of Service
   (DDOS) mitigation.

   BGP Flow-spec defines a BGP Network Layer Reachability Information
   (NLRI) format used to distribute traffic flow specification rules.
   AFI=1/SAFI=133 is for IPv4 unicast filtering. AFI=1/SAFI=134 is for
   IPv4 BGP/MPLS VPN filtering. [FlowSpecV6] and [FlowSpecL2] extend the
   flow-spec rules for IPv6 and layer 2 Ethernet packets respectively.
   None of these previous flow specifications are suitable for matching
   in cases of tunneling or encapsulation where there might be
   duplicates of a layer of header such as two IPv6 headers in IP-in-IP
   or a nested header sequence such as the layer 2 and 3 headers
   encapsulated in VXLAN [RFC7348].

   In the cloud computing era, multi-tenancy has become a core
   requirement for data centers. It is increasingly common to see
   tunneled traffic with a field to distinguish tenants. An example is
   the Network Virtualization Over Layer 3 (NVO3 [RFC8014]) overlay
   technology that can satisfy multi-tenancy key requirements. VXLAN
   [RFC7348] and NVGRE [RFC7637] are two typical NVO3 encapsulations.
   Other encapsulations such as IP-in-IP or GRE may be encountered.
   Because these tunnel / overlay technologies involving an additional
   level of encapsulation, flow specification that can match on the
   inner header as well as the outer header are needed.

   In summary, Flow specifications should be able to include inner
   nested header information as well as fields specific to the type of
   tunneling in use such as virtual network / tenant ID. This draft
   specifies methods for accomplishing this using SAFI=TBD1 and a new
   NLRI encoding.

2. Tunneled Traffic Flow Specification NLRI

   The Flow-spec rules specified in [RFC5575bis], [FlowSpecV6], and
   [FlowSpecL2] cannot match or filter tunneled traffic based on the
   tunnel type, any tunnel header fields, or headers past the tunnel
   header. To enable flow specification of tunneled traffic, a new SAFI
   (TBD1) and NLRI encoding are introduced. This encoding, shown in
   Figure 1, enables flow specification of more than one layer of header
   when needed.

         unsigned integer.

   Tunnel Type - The type of tunnel using a value from the IANA BGP
         Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Tunnel Types registry.

   Flags: D bit - Indicates the presence of the Routing Discriminator
         (see below).

   Flags: I bit - Indicates the presence of the Inner AFI and the Inner
         Flow-spec.

   Flags: Reserved - Six bits that MUST be sent as zero and ignored on
         receipt.

   Routing Discriminator - If the outer Layer 3 address belongs to a
         BGP/MPLS VPN, the routing discriminator can be included to
         support traffic filtering within that VPN. Because NVO3 outer
         layer addresses normally belong to a public network, a Route
         Distinguisher field is normally not needed for NVO3.

   Outer Flow-spec / Length - The flow specification for the outer
         header. The length is encoded as provided in Section 4.1 of
         [RFC5575bis]. The AFI for the outer Flow-spec is that AFI at
         the beginning of the BGP multiprotocol MP_REACH_NLRI or
         MP_UNREACH_NLRI containing the tunneled traffic flow
         specification NLRI.

   Tunnel Header Flow-spec / Length - The flow specification for the
         tunneling header. This can specify matching criterion on tunnel
         header fields.  The tunnel type itself is indicated by the
         Tunnel Type field above. For some types of tunneling, such as
         IP-in-IP, there may be no tunnel header fields. For other types
         of tunneling, there may be several tunnel header fields on
         which matching could be specified with this Flow-spec.

   Inner AFI - Depending on the Tunnel Type, there may be an Inner AFI
         that indicates the address family for the inner flow
         specification.  There is no need for a SAFI as, in effect, it
         is automatically TBD1, the SAFI for a tunneled traffic flow
         specification.

   Inner Flow-spec / Length - Depending on the Tunnel Type, there may be
         an inner flow specification for the header level encapsulated
         within the outer header. The length is encoded as provided in
         Section 4.1 of [RFC5575bis].

   A Tunneled Traffic Flow-spec matches if the Outer Flow-spec, Tunnel
   Header Flow-spec, and Inner Flow-spec all match and the Routing
   Discriminator applies, if present. An omitted (as can be done for the
   Inner Flow-spec) or null Flow-spec is considered to always match.



2.1 The SAFI Code Point

   Use of the tunneled traffic flow specification NLRI format is
   indicated by SAFI=TBD1. This is used in conjunction with the AFI for
   the outer header, that is AFI=1 for IPv4, AFI=2 for IPv6, and AFI=6

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      BGP Tunnel Flow-Spec


   for Layer 2.



2.2 Tunnel Header Component Code Points

   For flow specification based on most tunneling headers, there are
   additional tunnel header fields that can be tested by components that
   appear in the Tunnel Header Flow-spec field. The types for these
   components are specified in a Tunnel Header Flow-spec component
   registry (see Section 6).

   All Tunnel Header field components defined below and all such
   components added in the future have a TLV structure as follows:
     - one octet of type followed by
     - one octet giving the length as an unsigned integer number of
       octets followed by
     - the specific matching operations/values as determined by the
       type.

      Type 1 - VN ID
      Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>.

         Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match the
         24-bit VN ID that is used as the tenant identification in some
         tunneling headers. For VXLAN encapsulation, the VN ID is the
         VNI. For NVGRE encapsulation, the VN ID is the VSID. op is
         encoded as specified in Section 4.2.3 of [RFC5575bis]. Values
         are encoded as a 1, 2, or 4 octet quantity. If value is
         24-bits, they are left-justified in the first 3 octets of the
         value and the last value octet MUST be sent as zero and ignored
         on receipt.

      Type 2 - Flow ID
      Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>

         Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match 8-bit
         Flow ID fields which are currently only useful for NVGRE
         encapsulation. op is encoded as specified in Section 4.2.3 of
         [RFC5575bis]. Values are encoded as a 1-octet quantity.

      Type 3 - Session
      Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>

         Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match a
         32-bit Session field. This field is called Key in GRE [RFC2890]
         encapsulation and Session ID in L2TPv3 encapsulation. op is
         encoded as specified in Section 4.2.3 of [RFC5575bis]. Values
         are encoded as a 1, 2, or 4 octet quantity.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      BGP Tunnel Flow-Spec


      Type 4 - Cookie
      Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, value]+>

         Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match a
         variable length Cookie field. This is only useful in L2TPv3
         encapsulation. op is encoded as specified in Section 4.2.3 of
         [RFC5575bis]. Values are encoded as a 1, 2, 4, or 8 octet
         quantity. If the Cookie does not fit exactly into the value
         length, it is left justified, that is, padded with following
         octets the MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

      Type 5 - VXLAN-GPE Flags
      Encoding: <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), [op, bitmask]+>

         Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match
         against the VXLAN-GPE flags field. op is encoded as in Section
         4.2.9 of [RFC5575bis]. bitmask is encoded as 1 octet.



2.3 Specific Tunnel Types

   The following subsections describe how to handle flow specification
   for several specific tunnel types.



2.3.1 VXLAN

   The headers on a VXLAN [RFC7348] data packet are an outer Ethernet
   header, an outer IP header, a UDP header, the VXLAN header, and an
   inner Ethernet header. This inner Ethernet header is frequently, but
   not always, followed by an inner IP header. If the tunnel type is
   VXLAN, the I flag MUST be set.

   If the outer Ethernet header is not being matched, the version (IPv4
   or IPv6) of the outer IP header is indicated by the AFI at the
   beginning of the multiprotocol MP_REACH_NLRI or MP_UNREACH_NLRI
   containing the tunneled traffic flow specification NLRI.  The outer
   Flow-spec is used to filter the outer headers including, if desired,
   the UDP header.

   If the outer Ethernet header is being matched, then the initial AFI
   is 6 [FlowSpecL2] and the Outer Flow-spec can match the outer
   Ethernet header, specify the IP version of the outer IP header, and
   match that IP header including, if desired, the UDP header.

   The Tunnel Header Flow-spec can be used to filter on the VXLAN header
   VN ID (VNI).



D. Eastlake, et al                                              [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      BGP Tunnel Flow-Spec


   The inner Flow-spec can be used on the Inner Ethernet header
   [FlowSpecL2] and any following IP header.  If the inner AFI is 6,
   then the inner Flow-spec provides filtering of the Layer 2 header,
   indicates whether filtering on a following IPv4 or IPv6 header is
   desired, and if it is desired provides the Flow-spec components for
   that filtering.  If the Inner AFI is 1 or 2, the Inner Ethernet
   header is not matched and to match the Flow-spec the Inner Ethernet
   header must be followed by an IPv4 or IPv6 header, respectively, and
   the inner Flow-spec is used to filter that inner IP header.

   The inner MAC/IP address is associated with a VN ID. In the NVO3
   terminating into a VPN scenario, if multiple access VN IDs map to one
   VPN instance, one shared VN ID can be carried in the Flow-Spec rule
   to enforce the rule on the entire VPN instance and the shared VN ID
   and VPN correspondence should be configured on each VPN PE
   beforehand. In this case, the function of the Layer 3 VN ID is the
   same as a Route Discriminator: it acts as the identification of the
   VPN instance.



2.3.2 VXLAN-GPE

   VXLAN-GPE [GPE] is similar to VXLAN and the VXLAN-GPE header is the
   same size as the VXLAN header but has been extended from the VXLAN
   header by specifying a number of bits that are reserved in the VXLAN
   header. In particular, a number of additional flag bits are specified
   and a Next Protocol field is added that is valid if the P flag bit is
   set.  These flags bits can be tested using the VXLAN-GPE Flags
   component defined above. VXLAN and VXLAN-GPE are distinguished by the
   port number in the UDP header the precedes the VXLAN or VXLAN-GPE
   headers.

   If the VXLAN-GPE header P flag is zero, then that header is followed
   by the same sequence as for VXLAN and the same Flow-spec choices
   apply (see Section 2.3.1).

   If the VXLAN-GPE header P flag is one and that header's next protocol
   field is 1, then the VXLAN-GPE header is followed by an IPv4 header.
   The inner AFI/Flow-spec match only if the inner AFI is 1 and the
   inner Flow-spec matches.

   If the VXLAN-GPE header P flag is one and that header's next protocol
   field is 2, then the VXLAN-GPE header is followed by an IPv6 header.
   The inner AFI/Flow-spec match only if the inner AFI is 2 and the
   inner Flow-spec matches.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                      BGP Tunnel Flow-Spec


2.3.3 NVGRE

   NVGRE [RFC7637] is very similar to VXLAN except that the UDP header
   and VXLAN header immediately after the outer IP header are replaced
   by a GRE (Generic Router Encapsulation) header. The GRE header as
   used in NVGRE has no Checksum or Reserved1 field as shown in
   [RFC2890] but there are Virtual Subnet ID and Flow ID fields in place
   of what is labeled in [RFC2890] as the Key field. Processing and
   restrictions for NVGRE are as in Section 2.3.1 eliminating references
   to a UDP header and replacing references to the VXLAN header and its
   VN ID with references to the GRE header and its VN ID (VSID) and Flow

2.3.4 L2TPv3

   The headers on an L2TPv3 [RFC3931] packets are an outer Ethernet
   header, an outer IP header, the L2TPv3 header, an inner Ethernet
   header, and possibly an inner IP header if indicated by the inner
   Ethernet header EtherType. The outer Flow-spec operates on the outer
   headers that precede the GRE header. The version of IP is specified
   by the outer AFI at the beginning of the MP_REACH_NLRI or
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI.

   The L2TPv3 header consists of a 32-bit Session ID followed by a
   variable length Cookie (maximum length 8 octets). The Session ID and
   Cookie can be filtered for by using the Session and Cookie Flow-spec
   components in the Tunnel Header Flow-spec. To filter on Cookie or
   even be able to bypass Cookie and parse the remainder of the L2TPv3
   packet, the node implementing Flow-spec needs to know the length
   and/or value of the Cookie fields of interest. This is negotiated at
   L2TPv3 session establishment and it is out of scope for this document
   how the node would learn this information. Of course, if Flow-spec is
   being used for DDOS mitigation and the Cookie has a fixed length
   and/or value in the DDOS traffic, this could be learned by inspecting
   that traffic.

   If the I flag bit is zero, then no filtering is done on data beyond
   the L2TPv3 header. If the I flag is one, indicating the presence of
   an inner Flow-spec, and the node implementing Flow-spec does not know
   the length of the L2TPv3 header Cookie, the match fails. If that node
   does know the length of that Cookie, the inner Flow-spec if matched
   against the headers at the beginning of that data using the inner
   AFI. If the inner AFI is 1 or 2, then an inner IP header is required
   and filtering can be done on the Ethernet header immediately after
   the L2TPv3 header and the following IPv4 or IPv6 headers
   respectively. If the inner AFI is 6, filtering SHOULD only be done on
   the inner Ethernet header [FlowSpecL2].

2.3.5 GRE

   Generic Router Encapsulation (GRE [RFC2890]) is another type of
   encapsulation. The outer Flow-spec operates on the outer headers that
   precede the GRE header. The version of IP is specified by the outer
   AFI at the beginning of the MP_REACH_NLRI or MP_UNREACH_NLRI.

   If the I flag bit is zero, no filtering is done on data after the GRE
   header. If the I flag bit is one, then there is an inner AFI and
   Flow-spec and the Protocol Type field of the GRE header must match
   the inner AFI as follows for the Flow-spec to match:

       GRE Protocol Type    Inner AFI
      -------------------  -----------
       0x0800  (IPv4)             1
       0x86DD  (IPv6)             2
       0x6558                     6

   With the I flag a one and the inner AFI and GRE Protocol Type fields
   match, the inner Flow-spec is used to filter the inner Ethernet
   header (AFI=6) or the inner IP and Ethernet headers (AFI=1 or 2).



2.3.6 IP-in-IP

   IP-in-IP encapsulation is shown when the outer IP header indicates an
   inner IP IPv4 or IPv6 header by the value of the outer IP header's
   Protocol (IPv4) or Next Protocol (IPv6) field. If the Tunnel Type is
   IP-in-IP, the I flag MUST be set.

   The version of the outer IP header (IPv4 or IPv6) matched is
   indicated by the AFI at the beginning of the MP_REACH_NLRI or
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI.  The version of the inner IP header is indicated by
   the inner AFI. The outer Flow-spec applies to the outer IP header and
   the inner Flow-spec applies to the inner IP header.

   There are no fields that can be matched by the Tunnel Header Flow-
   spec in the case of IP-in-IP.



2.4 Tunneled Traffic Actions

   The traffic filtering actions previously specified in [RFC5575bis]
   and [FlowSpecL2] are used for tunneled traffic. For Traffic Marking
   in NVO3, only the DSCP in the outer header can be modified.

3. Order of Traffic Filtering Rules

   In comparing an applicable tunneled traffic flow specification with a
   non-tunneled flow specification, the tunneled specification has
   precedence.

   If comparing two tunneled traffic flow specifications, if both are
   applicable, the tunnel types will be the same. If only one has a
   Routing Discriminator, it has precedence. If both have a Routing
   Discriminator, then either those Routing Discriminators will be equal
   or only one of the Flow-specs will be applicable to the packet.

   If neither has a Routing Discriminator or they have equal Routing
   Discriminators, the order of precedence is determined by comparing
   the outer Flow-spec.

   If the outer Flow-specs are equal, then the Tunnel Header Flow-specs
   are compared using the usual component comparison rules.

   If the Tunnel Header Flow-specs are equal and the tunnel type calls
   for an inner Flow-spec, then the precedence is determined by
   comparing inner AFI as an unsigned integer with the inner AFI having
   the smaller magnitude having precedence.

   If the inner AFIs are equal, precedence is determined by comparing
   the inner flow specifications.

4. Flow Spec Validation

   Flow-specs received over AFI=1/SAFI=TBD1 or AFI=2/SFAI=TBD1 are
   validated, using only the outer Flow-spec, against routing
   reachability received over AFI=1/SAFI=133 and AFI=2/SAFI=133
   respectively, as modified by [FlowSpecOID].



5. Security Considerations

   No new security issues are introduced to the BGP protocol by this
   specification.

   For general Flow-spec security considerations, see [rfc5575bis].



6. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new SAFI as follows:

      Value  Description                                 Reference
      ----- ------------------------------------------  ---------------
       TBD1  Tunneled traffic flow specification rules  [This document]

   IANA is requested to create a Tunnel Header Flow Spec Component Type
   registry on the Flow Spec Component Types registries web page as
   follows:

      Name:  Tunnel Flow Spec Component Types
      Reference: [this document]
