1. Terminology 
    
   This document uses terminologies defined in [RFC3945], [RFC4206], and  
   [MLN-REQ]. 
    
2. Introduction 
 
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extends MPLS to 
   handle multiple switching technologies: packet switching (PSC), 
   layer-two switching (L2SC), TDM switching (TDM), wavelength switching 
   (LSC) and fiber switching (FSC) (see [RFC 3945]). 
    
   A data plane layer is a collection of network resources capable of 
   terminating and/or switching data traffic of a particular format. For 
   example, LSC, TDM VC-11 and TDM VC-4-64c represent three different 
   layers. A network comprising transport nodes with different data 
   plane switching layers controlled by a single GMPLS control plane 
   instance is called a Multi-Layer Network (MLN).  
 
   A GMPLS switching type (PSC, TDM, etc.) describes the ability of a 
   node to forward data of a particular data plane technology, and 
   uniquely identifies a control plane region. The notion of LSP Region 
   is defined in [RFC4206]. A network comprised of multiple switching 
   types (e.g. PSC and TDM) controlled by a single GMPLS control plane 
   instance is called a Multi-Region Network (MRN). 
    
   Note that the region is a control plane only concept. That is, layers 
   of the same region share the same switching technology and, 
   therefore, need the same set of technology specific signaling 
   objects.  
 
   Note that a MRN is necessarily a MLN, but not vice versa, as a MLN 
   may consist of a single region (control of multiple data plane layers 
   within a region). Hence, in the following, we use the term layer if 
   the mechanism discussed applies equally to layers and regions (e.g. 
   VNT, virtual TE-link, etc.), and we specifically use the term region 
   if the mechanism applies only for supporting a MRN. 
 
   The objectives of this document are to evaluate existing GMPLS 
   mechanisms and protocols ([RFC 3945], [RFC4202], [RFC3471]) against 
   the requirements for MLN and MRN, defined in [MLN-REQ]. From this 
   evaluation, we identify several areas where additional protocol 
   extensions and modifications are required to meet these requirements, 
   and provide guidelines for potential extensions. 
    
   An overview of MLN/MRN requirements is provided in section 3. Then 
   section 4 evaluates for each of these requirements, whether current 
   GMPLS protocols and mechanisms allow addressing the requirements. 
   When the requirements are not met, the document identifies whether 
   the required mechanisms could rely on GMPLS protocols and procedure 
   extensions or if it is entirely out of the scope of GMPLS protocols.

   Note that this document specifically addresses GMPLS control plane   
   functionality for MLN/MRN in the context of a single administrative 
   control plane partition. 
 
  
3. MLN/MRN Requirements Overview 
 
   [MLN-REQ] lists a set of functional requirements for Multi 
   Layer/Region Networks (MLN/MRN). These requirements are summarized 
   below: 
    
        - Support of robust Virtual Network Topology (VNT)   
          reconfiguration. This implies the following requirements: 
                - Optimal control of FA-LSP setup and release; 
                - Support for virtual TE-links; 
                - Traffic Disruption minimization during FA-LSP release  
                  (e.g. network reconfiguration events); 
                - Stability; 
    
        - Support for FA-LSP attributes inheritance; 
         
        - Support for Triggered Signaling; 
 
        - Support for FA-LSP data plane connectivity verification; 
         
        - Support for Multi-Region signaling; 
 
        - Advertisement of the adaptation capabilities and resources; 
         
    
4. Analysis 
    
4.1. Multi-Layer Aspects 
    
4.1.1. Support for Virtual Network Topology Reconfiguration 
 
   A set of lower-layer FA-LSPs provides a Virtual Network Topology 
   (VNT) to the upper-layer. By reconfiguring the VNT (FA-LSP 
   setup/release) according to traffic demands between source and 
   destination node pairs of a layer, network performance factors such 
   as maximum link utilization and residual capacity of the network can 
   be optimized. Such optimal VNT reconfiguration implies several 
   mechanisms that are analyzed in the following sections. 
    
   Note that the VNT approach is just one approach among others, to 
   perform inter-layer Traffic Engineering.

4.1.1.1. Control of FA-LSPs Setup/Release 
         
   In a Multi-Layer Network, FA-LSPs are created, modified, released 
   periodically according to the change of incoming traffic demands from 
   the upper layer. 
    
   This implies a TE mechanism that takes into account the demands 
   matrix, the TE topology and potentially the current VNT, in order to 
   compute a new VNT.  
 
   Several functional building blocks are required to support such TE 
   mechanism: 
    
        - Discovery of TE topology and available resources. 
    
        - Collection of traffic demands of the upper layer. 
    
        - VNT resources policing/scheduling with regards to traffic  
          demands and usage (i.e. decision to setup/release FAs); The  
          functional component in charge of this function is called a  
          VNT Manager (VNTM), it may be distributed on network  
          elements or centralized on an external tool (see [VNTM]). It  
          may also be partially centralized and distributed. 
    
        - VNT Path Computation according to TE topology, and potentially  
          taking into account old VNT (to minimize changes); The   
          Functional component in charge of VNT computation may be  
          distributed on network elements or may be centralized on an  
          external tool (such as e.g. a PCE). 
    
        - FA-LSP setup/release. 
    
   GMPLS routing protocols support TE topology discovery. GMPLS 
   signaling protocols allow setting up/releasing FA-LSPs. 
 
   VNT Management functions (resources policing/scheduling, decision to 
   setup/release FA, FA configuration) are out of the scope of GMPLS 
   protocols. Such functionalities can be achieved directly on layer 
   border LSRs, and/or on one or more external tools. When an external 
   tool is used, an interface is required between the VNTM and network 
   elements so has to setup/releases FA-LSPs. This may rely on SNMP (TE 
   MIB) or on proprietary interfaces. 
    
   The set of traffic demands of the upper layer is required for the VNT 
   Manager to take decisions to setup/release FAs. This requires 
   knowledge of the aggregated bandwidth reserved by upper layer LSPs 
   established between any pair of border LSRs.  
   Existing GMPLS routing allows for the collection of traffic demands 
   of the upper region. It can be deduced from FA TE-link advertisements.  
   The set of traffic demands can be inferred: 
      - either directly, based on upper-layer FA TE-link advertisements.  
 
Le Roux, et al.   Evaluation of GMPLS against MLN/MRN Reqs    [Page 5] 
  
Internet Draft    draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-mln-eval-02.txt    October 2006 


        The traffic demands between two points correspond to the  
        cumulated bandwidth reserved by upper-layer LSPs between these    
        two points; 
      - or indirectly, based on lower-layer FA TE-link advertisements.  
        In this case a mechanism to infer the upper-layer traffic demand  
        from the aggregated bandwidth reserved in lower-layer LSPs might  
        be required, as all pairs of border nodes may not be directly  
        connected by a lower layer LSP. 
    
   Collection of traffic demands of an upper region may actually be 
   achieved in several ways depending on the location of VNT Managers: 
      - If a VNTM is distributed on border layer LSRs, then the  
        collection of traffic demands would rely on existing GMPLS  
        routing, as per described above;  
      - If a VNTM is centralized on an external tool, then the    
        collection of traffic demands may be achieved using existing  
        GMPLS routing, provided that the tool relies on GMPLS routing to      
        discover TE link information, or it may rely on another     
        mechanism out of the scope of GMPLS protocols (e.g. SNMP TE-link     
        MIB). 
    
   Finally, VNT computation can be performed directly on layer border 
   LSRs or on an external tool (such as an external PCE) and this 
   independently of the location of the VNTM. VNT computation is 
   triggered by the VNTM (e.g. when the Path computation is externalized 
   on a PCE, the VNTM acts as PCC). 
    
   Hence no GMPLS protocol extensions are required to control FA-LSP 
   setup/release. 
 
4.1.1.2. Virtual TE-Links 
         
   A Virtual TE-link is a TE-link between two nodes, not actually 
   associated to a fully provisioned FA-LSP. A Virtual TE-link 
   represents the potentiality to setup a FA-LSP. There is no IGP 
   adjacency associated to a Virtual TE-link. A Virtual TE-link is 
   advertised as any classical TE-link, i.e. following the rules in 
   [RFC4206] defined for fully provisioned TE-links. Particularly, the 
   flooding scope of a Virtual TE-link is within an IGP area, as any TE-
   link. 
     
   During its signalling, if an upper-layer LSP makes use of a Virtual 
   TE-link, the underlying FA-LSP is immediately signalled and 
   provisioned. 
    
   The use of Virtual TE-links has two main advantages: 
    
     - flexibility: allows to compute a LSP path using TE-links and this 
       without taking into account the actual status of the       
       corresponding FA-LSP in the lower layer in terms of provisioning; 
     
    
 
Le Roux, et al.   Evaluation of GMPLS against MLN/MRN Reqs    [Page 6] 
  
Internet Draft    draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-mln-eval-02.txt    October 2006 


    
     - stability: allows stability of TE-links in the upper layer, while  
       avoiding wastage of bandwidth in the lower layer, as data plane  
       connections are not established. 
    
   Virtual TE-links are setup/deleted/modified dynamically, according to 
   the change of the (forecast) traffic demand, operator's policies for 
   capacity utilization, and the available resources in the lower layer. 
    
   The support of Virtual TE-links requires two main building blocks: 
        - A TE mechanism for dynamic modification of Virtual TE-link    
          Topology; 
        - A signalling mechanism for the dynamic setup and deletion of 
          virtual TE-links. Setting up a virtual TE-link requires a  
          signalling mechanism allowing an end-to-end association  
          between Virtual TE-link end points so as to exchange link   
          identifiers as well as some TE parameters. 
    
   The TE mechanism responsible for triggering/policing dynamic 
   modification of Virtual TE-links is out of the scope of GMPLS 
   protocols. 
    
   Current GMPLS signalling does not allow setting up and releasing 
   Virtual TE-links. Hence GMPLS signalling must be extended to support 
   Virtual TE-links.  
 
   We can distinguish two options for setting up Virtual TE-links: 
    
        - The Soft FA approach, that consists of setting up the FA-LSP 
   in the control plane without actually activating cross connections in 
   the data plane. One the one hand, this requires state maintenance on 
   all transit LSRs (N square issue), but on the other hand this may 
   allow for some admission control. Indeed, when a soft-FA is 
   activated, there may be no longer available resources for other soft-
   FAs that were sharing common links, these soft-FA will be dynamically 
   released and corresponding virtual TE-links are deleted. The soft-FA 
   LSPs may be setup using procedures similar to those described in 
   [GMPLS-RECOVERY] for setting up secondary LSPs. 
    
        -The remote association approach, that simply consists of 
   exchanging virtual TE-links ids and parameters directly between TE-
   link end points. This does not require state maintenance on transit 
   LSRs, but reduce admission control capabilities. Such an association 
   between Virtual TE-link end-points may rely on extensions to the 
   RSVP-TE ASON Call procedure ([ASON-CALL]). 
    
   Note that the support of Virtual TE-link does not require any GMPLS 
   routing extension.

4.1.1.3. Traffic Disruption Minimization During FA Release 
 
   Before deleting a given FA-LSP, all nested LSPs have to be rerouted 
   and removed from the FA-LSP to avoid traffic disruption. 
   The mechanisms required here are similar to those required for 
   graceful deletion of a TE-Link. A Graceful TE-link deletion mechanism 
   allows for the deletion of a TE-link without disrupting traffic of 
   TE-LSPs that where using the TE-link. 
   GMPLS protocols do not provide for explicit indication to trigger 
   such operation. 
    
   Hence, GMPLS routing and/or signaling extensions are required 
   to support graceful deletion of TE-links.  This may rely, for 
   instance, on new signaling Error code to notify head-end LSRs that a 
   TE-link along the path of a LSP is going to disappear, and also on 
   new routing attributes (if limited to a single IGP area), such as 
   defined in [GR-SHUT]. 
 
4.1.1.4. Stability 
         
   The upper-layer LSP stability may be impaired if the VNT undergoes 
   frequent changes. In this context robustness of the VNT is defined as 
   the capability to smooth impact of these changes and avoid their 
   subsequent propagation. 
    
   Guaranteeing VNT stability is out of the scope of GMPLS protocols and 
   relies entirely on the capability of TE algorithms to minimize 
   routing perturbations. This requires that the TE algorithm takes into 
   account the old VNT when computing a new VNT, and tries to minimize 
   the perturbation. 
  
4.1.2. Support for FA-LSP Attributes Inheritance 
 
   When FA TE-link parameters are inherited from FA-LSP parameters, 
   specific inheritance rules are applied.  
    
   This relies on local procedures and policies and is out of the scope 
   of GMPLS protocols.  
   Note that this requires that both head-end and tail-end of the FA-LSP 
   are driven by same policies. 
 
4.1.3. Support for Triggered Signaling. 
 
   When a LSP crosses the boundary from an upper to a lower layer, it 
   may be nested in or stitched to a lower-layer LSP. If such an LSP 
   does not exist the LSP may be established dynamically. Such a 
   mechanism is referred to as "Triggered signaling".  
    
   Triggered signaling requires the following building blocks: 
        - The identification of layer boundaries. 
        - A path computation engine capable of computing a path     
          containing multiple layers. 
 
Le Roux, et al.   Evaluation of GMPLS against MLN/MRN Reqs    [Page 8] 
  
Internet Draft    draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-mln-eval-02.txt    October 2006 


        - A mechanism for nested signaling. 
 
   The identification of layer boundaries is supported by GMPLS routing 
   protocols. The identification of layer boundaries is performed using 
   the interface switching capability descriptor associated to the TE-
   link (see [RFC4206] and [RFC4202]). 
    
   The capability to compute a path containing multiple layers is a 
   local implementation issue and is out of the scope of GMPLS protocols. 
    
   A mechanism for nested signaling is defined in [RFC4206]. 
    
   Hence, GMPLS protocols already meet this requirement.  
    
    
4.1.4. FA Connectivity Verification 
 
   Once fully provisioned, FA liveliness may be achieved by verifying 
   its data plane connectivity. 
    
   FA connectivity verification relies on technology specific mechanisms 
   (e.g. for SDH, G.707, G.783, for MPLS, BFD, etc.) as for any other 
   LSP. Hence this requirement is out of the scope of GMPLS protocols. 
    
   Note that the time to establish the FA-LSP must be minimized. 
 
 
4.2. Multi-Region Specific Aspects 
    
4.2.1. Support for Multi-Region Signaling 
    
   Applying the triggered signaling procedure discussed above, in a MRN 
   environment may lead to the setup of one-hop FA-LSPs between each 
   node. Therefore, considering that the path computation is able to 
   take into account richness of information with regard to the 
   Switching Capability (SC) available on given nodes belonging to the 
   path, it is consistent to provide enough signaling information to 
   indicate the SC to be used and on over which link.   
        
   Limited extension to existing GMPLS signaling procedures is required 
   for this purpose as it only mandates indication of the SCs to be 
   included or excluded before initiating the LSP provisioning procedure. 
   This enhancement would solve the ambiguous choice of SC that are 
   potentially used along a given path, particularly in case of ERO 
   expansion, or when an ERO sub-object identifies a multi-SC TE-link. 
   This would give the possibility to optimize resource usage on a 
   multi-region basis.

4.2.2. Advertisement of Internal Adaptation Capabilities 
 
   In the MRN context, nodes supporting more than one switching 
   capability on at least one interface are called Hybrid nodes. Hybrid 
   nodes contain at least two distinct switching elements that are 
   interconnected by internal links to provide adaptation between the 
   supported switching capabilities. These internal links have finite 
   capacities and must be taken into account when computing the path of 
   a multi-region TE-LSP. The advertisement of the internal adaptation 
   capability is required as it provides critical information when 
   performing multi-region path computation. 
 
   Figure 1a below shows an example of hybrid node. The hybrid node has 
   two switching elements (matrices), which support here TDM and PSC 
   switching respectively. The node terminates two PSC and TDM ports 
   (port1 and port2 respectively). It also has internal link connecting 
   the two switching elements.  
   The two switching elements are internally interconnected in such a 
   way that it is possible to terminate some of the resources of the TDM

   received/sent over the internal PSC interface (#b). Two ways are 
   possible to set up PSC LSPs (port 1 or port 2). Available resources 
   advertisement e.g. Unreserved and Min/Max LSP Bandwidth should cover 
   both ways.

   Port 1 and Port 2 can be grouped together thanks to internal DWDM, to 
   result in a single interface: Link 1. This is illustrated in figure 
   1b below.

   Let's assume that all interfaces are STM16 (with VC4-16c capable  
   as Max LSP bandwidth). After, setting up several PSC LSPs via port #a 
   and setting up and terminating several TDM LSPs via port #d and port 
   #b, there is only 155 Mb capacities still available on port #b. 
   However a 622 Mb capacity remains on port #a and VC4-5c capacity on 
   port #d. 
    
   When computing the path for a new VC4-4c TDM LSP, one must know, that 
   this node cannot terminate this LSP, as there is only 155Mb still 
   available for TDM-PSC adaptation. Hence the internal TDM-PSC 
   adaptation capability must be advertised. 
    
   With current GMPLS routing [RFC4202] this advertisement is possible 
   if link bundling is not used and if two TE-links are advertised for 
   link1: 
    
   We would have the following TE-link advertisements: 
    
   TE-link 1 (port 1):  
        - ISCD sub-TLV: PSC with Max LSP bandwidth = 622Mb, unreserved    
                        bandwidth = 622Mb. 
          
   TE-Link 2 (port 2): 
        - ISCD #1 sub-TLV: TDM with Max LSP bandwidth = VC4-4c,  
                           unreserved bandwidth = vc4-5c. 
        - ISCD #2 sub-TLV: PSC with Max LSP bandwidth = 155 Mb,  
                           unreserved bandwidth = 155 Mb.

   The ISCD 2 in TE-link 2 represents actually the internal TDM-PSC 
   adaptation capability. 
    
   However if for obvious scalability reasons link bundling is done then 
   the adaptation capability information is lost with current GMPLS 
   routing, as we have the following TE-link advertisement: 
    
   TE-link 1 (port 1 + port 2):  
        - ISCD #1 sub-TLV: TDM with Max LSP bandwidth = VC4-4c,  
                           unreserved bandwidth = vc4-5c. 
        - ISCD #2 sub-TLV: PSC with Max LSP bandwidth = 622 Mb,  
                           unreserved bandwidth = 777 Mb.  
    
   With such TE-link advertisement an element computing the path of a 
   VC4-4c LSP cannot know that this LSP cannot be terminated on the 
   node. 
    
   Thus current GMPLS routing can support the advertisement of the 
   internal adaptation capability but this precludes performing link 
   bundling and thus faces significant scalability limitations.  
    
   Hence, GMPLS routing must be extended to meet this requirement. This 
   could rely on the advertisement of the internal adaptation capability 
   as a new TE link attribute (that would complement the Interface 
   Switching Capability Descriptor TE-link attribute).  
 
 
5. Evaluation Conclusion 
 
   Most of the required MLN/MRN functions will rely on mechanisms and 
   procedures that are out of the scope of the GMPLS protocols, and thus 
   do not require any GMPLS protocol extensions. They will rely on local 
   procedures and policies, and on specific TE mechanisms and 
   algorithms. 
    
   As regards Virtual Network Topology (VNT) computation and 
   reconfiguration, specific TE mechanisms that could for instance rely 
   on PCE based mechanisms and protocols, need to be defined, but these 
   mechanisms are out of the scope of GMPLS protocols. 
    
   Four areas for extensions of GMPLS protocols and procedures have been 
   identified: 
    
        - GMPLS signalling extension for the setup/deletion of    
          the virtual TE-links (as well as exact trigger for its actual  
          provisioning); 
    
        - GMPLS routing and signalling extension for graceful TE-link  
          deletion; 
 
        - GMPLS signalling extension for constrained multi-region

          signalling (SC inclusion/exclusion); 
    
        - GMPLS routing extension for the advertisement of the  
          internal adaptation capability of hybrid nodes. 
    
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   This document specifically addresses GMPLS control plane   
   functionality for MLN/MRN in the context of a single administrative 
   control plane partition and hence does not introduce additional 
   security threats beyond those described in [RFC3945].
