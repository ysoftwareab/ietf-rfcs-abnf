Abstract

   This document defines a new sub-option for the CableLabs Client
   Configuration (CCC) DHCP option code for conveying the network 
   address of the Key Distribution Center (KDC) server.

1.  Introduction

   The need for a CCC DHCP Option code is described in [1]. The CCC 
   DHCP option code will be used to address specific needs of CableLabs
   client devices during their configuration processes. This document 
   proposes a sub-option for the CCC DHCP option.

Internet Draft	  KDC Server Address Sub-option       September 2002


   Configuration of a class of CableLabs client devices described in 
   [2] requires a DHCP sub-option to provide the client with the
   address of the cable operator's KDC server.  This document proposes
   an additional sub-option for use with CableLabs client devices. The
   sub-option encodes an identifier of the network address for the Key  
   Distribution Center server with which the CableLabs client device
   must exchange security information. 

   CableLabs plans to assign sub-option code ranges according to
   CableLabs projects. The range (51 - 100) is assigned to the 
   CableHome project. Use of the initial value of this range is
   specified in [2].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY" 
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].


2.  Key Distribution Center IP Address Sub-option

   The CableHome 1.0 specification [2] specifies the Key Distribution 
   Center network address encoding as a sub-option of the CCC DHCP 
   Option code. This field is used to inform the client device of the
   network address of the Key Distribution Center server. 

   The encoding of sub-option 51 will adhere to the format of an IPv4 
   address using the default port. The sub-option length MUST be 4. The
   length octet MUST be followed by 4 octets of IPv4 address.   

   The KDC Server sub-option is coded as follows:

            SubOpt  Len        Address
           +------+-----+------+------+------+------+
           |  51  |  4  |  a1  |  a2  |  a3  |  a4  |
           +------+-----+------+------+------+------+


3.  Security Considerations

   This document relies upon the DHCP protocol [4] for authentication
   and security, i.e., it does not provide security in excess of what
   DHCP is (or will be) providing. It does not expose any security
   threats beyond what is currently exposed by other DHCP options.

   
4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a value of 51 for the CableLabs Client 
   Configuration (CCC) sub-option code described in [1] and referred 
   to in this document.
