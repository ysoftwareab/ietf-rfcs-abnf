1.  Introduction

   In the draft [I-D.wang-teas-pce-native-ip], the scenario for TE in
   native IP network is described and a dual/multi-BGP sessions solution
   is proposed to meet the TE requirements.  This document is for the
   same scenario and requirements as [I-D.wang-teas-pce-native-ip],
   however, a BGP community based method is used for steering traffic
   instead of dual/multi-BGP sessions.

2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Machanism

   To differentiate traffics with various priority, BGP community is
   used to classify route prefixes.  Assign a specific next-hop address
   for a specific BGP community which could be done by BGP route policy.
   Then through controling the path for a specific next-hop address we
   can steer the related traffic.

   The following is an example with a simple topology:

                 Figure 1: A simple topology as an example

   In this topology, assume traffic between IP11 and IP21 is normal
   traffic, traffic between IP12 and IP22 is high priority.  The
   following procedures can fulfill the differentiated traffic steering:

   (1) On R1, assign BGP community 100:100 for IP11 and 100:200 for
   IP12.  On R2, assign BGP community 100:100 for IP21 and 100:200 for
   IP22.

   (2) On R1, use BGP route policy to set the next-hop as lo0 for
   prefixes with community 100:100 and lo1 for prefixes with community
   100:200.  Make the same configuration on R2.

   (3) On R1, set an explicit route to R2's lo0 through path-1 and
   another explicit route to R2's lo1 through path-2.  On R2, set an
   explicit route to R1's lo0 through path-1 and another explicit route
   to R1's lo1 through path-2.

   Through the above procedures traffic with different priority can be
   steered to appointed path as needed.  More BGP communities and
   loopback interfaces/addresses can be created for more traffic classes
   in a more complex enviroment.

   In a PCE enabled network, the above procedures can be fulfilled in a
   automated way.  PCE can set the binding of BGP community and route
   prefixes, BGP community and next-hops/loopback addresses.  PCE can
   change the BGP community for specific prefixes to steer the related
   traffic to a different priority/path.  PCE also can set explicit
   route hop by hop for a specific next-hop/loopback address to steer
   the related traffic as needed.  In addition, PCEP need to be extended
   to transfer the necessary parameters, such as BGP communities, next-
   hop/loopback addresses, related route prefixes and explicit route for
   a specific next-hop.  How to extend PCEP is out of this document's
   scope.
