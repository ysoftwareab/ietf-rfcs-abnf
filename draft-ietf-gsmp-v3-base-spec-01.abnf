IQS = 00:  In this case, the Input Service Selector indicates a
                 simple priority.

IQS = 01:  In this case, the Input Service Selector is an opaque
                 service profile identifier.  The definition of these
                 service profiles is outside the scope of this
                 specification.  Service Profiles can be used to
                 indicate pre-defined Differentiated Service Per Hop
                 Behaviours.

IQS = 10:  In this case, the Input Service Selector corresponds to
                 a Service Spec as defined in Chapter 8.2.  When the
                 value of either IQS or OQS is set to 0b10, then a
                 Traffic Parameters Block is appended to the message.

IQS = 11:  In this case the Input Service Selector corresponds to
                 an ARM service specification.  Definition of ARM
                 service specifications is outside the scope of this
                 specification and is determined by the MType as defined
                 in Chapter 8.1.

OQS = 00:  In this case the Output Service Selector indicates a
                 simple priority.

OQS = 01:  In this case the Output Service Selector is an opaque
                 service profile identifier.  The definition of these
