1.    Introduction

   This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may use
   an IEEE 802.1ah PBN (Provider Backbone Bridge Network) to provide IP 
   Virtual Private Network (VPN) Service for its customers.  This method 
   follows the same "peer model" as described in [BGP-MPLS-VPN], in 
   which the customers' edge routers (CE routers) send their routes to 
   the Service Provider's edge routers (PE routers).  Border Gateway 
   Protocol (BGP) [BGP, BGP-MP] is then used by the Service Provider to 
   exchange the routes of a particular VPN among the PE routers which 
   are attached to that VPN.  
   
   In this method, normal [BGP-MPLS-VPN] operations will be followed 
   for attachment circuit, VRF, and VPN route distribution. However, 
   MPLS LSP is replaced by a PBB B-VLAN.  This transport decoupling 
   allows BGP/VPN to run over a PBBN instead of a MPLS network.  Before 
   a customer data packet passes through the Provider's PBBN, a B-VLAN

   path will be selected that corresponds, in the customer's VPN, to the 
   transport path that is the best match to the packet's destination 
   address. Thus, the PBBN core bridges do not have to know the VPN 
   routes.

1.1.  Customer Edge and Provider Edge route exchange
                             
   Each VPN site must contain one or more Customer Edge (CE) devices.
   Each CE device is attached to one or more Provider Edge (PE) devices
   known as Provider Backbone Edge Bridge (IB-BEB) via attachment 
   circuit.  An IB-BEB high-level architectural view is shown in Figure 
   1.

        Figure 1. IB-BEB High-Level Bridge Architecture

   Bridges in the SP's network that do not attach to CE devices are
   known as "Provider Backbone Core Bridges" (BCB).

   CE devices exchange routes with PE devices using static routes, OSPF
   , or eBGP. CE devices can be hosts or routers.
    
1.2.  Internal Route Distribution Among Provider PEs

   In this method, instead of using IGP for internal route distibution,
   PATH MP-IBGP [BGP-PATH-BINDING] is used to distibute a Link Layer
   <Path_Next_Hop> piggybacked on NLRI, along with the usual Network 
   Layer BGP Next Hop for each internal network route advertised by a 
   Path MP-IBGP speaker.  
    
   In this manner, within an autonomous switching domain, each PE can 
   reach the next hop of an internal network route directly using 
   Ethernet switching over a PBB B-VLAN.

Internet-Draft        draft-kao-pbb-l3vpn-00.txt         January 9, 2011

                              
   The Path_Next_Hop field piggybacked in NLRI of a BGP Update message 
   should be the MAC address of a CBP (Customer Backbone Port) on the 
   IB-BEB which is advertising the internal routes.  There can be one or 
   more CBP resource(s) on a IB-BEB.
                                            
1.3.  Provider Backbone Core Bridges

   In a PBN, the Provider Backbone Core Bridges (BCB) switches frames 
   only based on B-DA, and B-VID.

   BCB can rely on STP, RSTP, MSTP, RPVSTP, TRILL, SPB (Shortest Path 
   Bridging), or manual provisioning to resolve network topology.

2.    Customer VPN Route Distribution

   Customer VPN-IPv4 route distribution is still done using Labeled VPN 
   MP-IBGP as in [BGP-MPLS-VPN].  On each PE, the VPN-IPv4 BGP Next Hop 
   (RD=0) it advertises for its customer VPN-IPv4 routes has to resolve
   to the same BGP Next Hop advertised in Path MP-IBGP.  This way, 
   internal link layer path connectivity remains consistent both
   internal network and external customer VPN routes.

3.    Control Plane connectivity

3.1.  Interal Route Distribution
   
   Path MP-IBGP speakers talk to each other through a common control 
   B-VLAN with an unique, reserved I-SID by configuration.  The Path MP-
   IBGP packets should be encapsulated as payload in a PBB frame.  In 
   that PBB frame, the C-DA and C-SA fields should be set to zero 
   and the NCA bit in I-tag should be set to 1. There should be no S-TAG 
   or C-TAG in the frame.

   Referring to Figure 1, architecturally speaking, a BGP speaker 
   resides in the I-COMP of a BEB. eBGP traffic comes in from attachment 
   circuit and iBGP traffic comes in from the PIP which has the same 
   B-MAC as its associated CBP.  Each iBGP speaker on a IB-BEB needs to 
   be associated with one or more CBP MAC address by configuration.  An 
   associated CBP MAC address should be used as the B-SA in frames the 
   iBGP speaker originates and should match the Path_Next_Hop advertised 
   in the BGP Update message.  This enables an iBGP speaker to manage 
   multiple CBP resources for purposes such as load balancing.

3.2.  VPN Route Distribution

   Labeled VPN MP-IBGP speakers talk to each other using the default 
   forwarding table after the internal routes have been established with
   <Path_Next_Hop> bindings installed.

   This is done to ensure that a single unified VPN peer PE reachability 
   method is used by the various hierarchical/recursive VPN interworking
   applications.  The external customer VPN routes are distributed as
   labeled VPN-IPv4 routes as in [BGP-MPLS-VPN].
                                              
3.3.  Use of Route Reflectors 

   Rather than having a complete IBGP mesh among the PEs, BGP Route 
   Reflectors [BGP-RR] can be used to improve scalability.  Within a 
   BGP/PB VPN switching domain, one or more RR can be used.  The only 
   requirement specific to BGP/PB VPN is that if a RR participates in 
   Path MP-IBGP sessions then it must have control VLAN connectivity to 
   all the PEs which are its clients.
   
4.    VPN IP Packet Forwarding

4.1   VPN Packet Format

   Since labeled VPN IPv4 routes are used for external customer VPN 
   route distribution, this addressing information needs to be preserved
   among peering VPN PEs. In this method, this is done by carrying the
   VPN label stack generated at each PE, per [BGP-MPLS-VPN], inside a 
   PBB-VIF (PBB-VPN Interworking Frame) format. In particular:

Internet-Draft        draft-kao-pbb-l3vpn-00.txt         January 9, 2011


    - PBB-VIF (PBB-VPN Interworking Frame)
      
      Within a PBBN, the VPN traffic transported should use the 
      following format:

          |DA|SA|B-Tag|I-TAG|0x8847|Label|IP Payload|FCS|

      For the most part, this is a Mac-in-Mac Provider Backbone Bridge 
      Frame. An additional MPLS Label field is inserted before the 
      usual frame payload position.  The Label field contains a label 
      stack of one or more labels depending on the hierarchy of the 
      interworking VPN networks.  The specifications of all fields are 
      as defined in their respective specifications.        

      There is no S-VLAN, C-VLAN, or custom MAC address in the frame. 
      The I-tag NCA bit should be set.
   
4.2.  Ingress PE Processing

   When an ingress PE receives a user IP packet on an attachment 
   circuit, it first follows the normal BGP/MPLS operation right before
   the point when an egress PE to LSP mapping needs to be resolved.  
   At this point, instead of resolving to a LSP, the ingress PE uses an
   egress PE to Path_Next_Hop mapping to resolve the transport
   path.  In a PBB-VIF frame with user IP packet in the payload, the 
   ingress PE will then form a PBB-VIF frame with the usual BGP/MPLS VPN 
   label stack in the label stack field, use the <Path_Next_Hop> as B-DA
   , use the I-SID associated with the ingress attachment circuit to
   lookup a CBP and B-VLAN mapping, use the CBP port MAC as B-SA, put 
   customer IP packet in the payload, and forward the PBB-VIF frame onto 
   the B-VLAN, out of the CBP.
   
   Note that, the I-SID to attachment circuit association is by 
   configuration. The <I-SID, CBP, B-VLAN> association is also by 
   configuration.  
   
   When PBB-TE Linear APS is used, the I-SID to B-VLAN mapping may be 
   updated by PBB-TE Linear APS to put the packet on a different path 
   across a PBBN.
     
4.3.  Egress PE processing

   When a PBB-VIF packet reaches the egress PE, it extracts the IP 
   payload and the VPN label stack carried in the PBB-VIF then proceeds 
   with normal BGP/MPLS operation as specified in [BGP-MPLS-VPN]. 
      
   With respect to the forwarding path through the PBBN, the following 
   should be noted:
     
     - Determined by B-VLAN ID;

Internet-Draft        draft-kao-pbb-l3vpn-00.txt         January 9, 2011


     - DOES NOT require that the B-VLAN be point-to-point; multipoint-
       multipoint can be used;

     - DOES NOT require that there be any VLAN-specific signaling;

     - DOES NOT require any IGP. Can work with manual provisioning, 
       GVRP, STP, RSTP, MSTP, RPVSTP, SPB, or TRILL.
       
5.    Carriers' Carriers and Maulti-AS Backbones

   With an embedded VPN stack, a PBB-VIF can be used to preserve the VPN 
   interworking processing specified in [BGP-MPLS-VPN] for both single-
   AS and Multi-AS applications.  In particular,
   
    - An MPLS interface should always be used at VPN network boundaries. 
      This enables the end-to-end customer VPN PE route identification
      to be preserved across a hierarchical/recursive VPN network.
   
    - A PBB/VPN network uses Path MP-IBGP to distribute internal network
      routes and use Labeled VPN MP-IBGP to distribute external customer
      VPN routes.
      
   As an example, per Multi-AS VPN interworking option c) [BGP-MPLS-VPN]
   , two MPLS/VPN providers are interconnected via a PBB/VPN transit
   VPN provider in this recursive VPN example.  
         
    Provider A (AS 1)  |Transit Provider (AS 2)|  Provider B (AS 3)
   
    |-----------------Labeled VPN Multi-hop MP-EBGP------------------|
    |                                                                |
    |                     Labeled VPN MP-IBGP                        |
    |                   |---------------------|                      |
    |                   |                     |                      |
    |                   |                     |                      |
    | IGP+LDP     EBGP  |     PATH MP-IBGP    | EBGP     IGP+LDP     |
    v                   v                     v                      v  
  |A-PE|---|A-CE|------|T-PE-L|---------|T-PE-R|------|B-CE|-----|B-PE|     
  [  MPLS/VPN   ][MPLS][        PBB/VPN        ][MPLS ][   MPLS/VPN   ]
                                                            
  |->       MPLS     <-|->      PBB-VIF      <-|->      MPLS        <-|

      Figure 2. MPLS/VPN Provider with PBB/VPN Transit Provider
   
   The key point here is that, at T-PE-L and T-PE-R, a PBB-VIF preserves 
   the VPN label stack hierarchy resulted from the two independent 
   Labeled VPN MP-xBGP sessions allowing the noraml GBP/MPLS PE label
   operations to be applied such that MPLS path connectivity can be 
   preserved end-to-end.  Within the BGP/PBB VPN, the IGP/RSVP T-PE-L to
   T-PE-R label path can then be replaced by a <Path_Next_Hop> transport 
   path without impacting the VPN label hierarchy.

6.    Quality of Service

   In BGP/PBB VPNs, existing L2 QoS capabilities can be applied to 
   B-VLAN tagged packets as specified in IEEE 802.1ah.

7.    Scalability

   In a BGP/PBB VPN network, the Service Provider backbone network 
   consists of (a) BGP/PBB IB-BEB edge switchs, (b) BGP Route Reflectors
   , (c) BCB core switches, and, in the case of multi-provider VPNs with
   MPLS/VPN [BGP-MPLS-VPN] or PB/VPN [BGP-PB-VPN] interworking, (d) 
   ASBRs.

   BCBs do not maintain any Internal or VPN routes.  In order to 
   properly forward VPN traffic, the BCBs need only maintain backbone 
   MAC address and VLAN information.
    
   A BGP/PB PEB switch maintains VPN routes, but only for those VPNs to 
   which it is directly attached.

   For inter-provider VPNs with MPLS interworking, the route 
   distribution model specified in [BGP-MPLS-VPN] is preserved in order 
   to maintain the scalability.
   
   As a result, scalability is achieved by ensuring that every 
   individual component within a single-AS or Multi-AS network, with or 
   without MPLS/VPN, or PB/VPN interworking, only has to maintain 
   directly attached VPN routes.

8.    OAM&P

   For VLAN continuity and Performance Monitoring among PEs, ITU-T 
   Y.1731 should be used. Multicast CCM should be used whenever there
   are more than two Path_Next_Hop end-points reachable on a B-VLAN,
   otherwise Unicast CCM should be used.
