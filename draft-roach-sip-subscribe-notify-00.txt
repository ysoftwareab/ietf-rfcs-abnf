Abstract

     This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation
     Protocol (SIP) [1] . The purpose of this extension is to provide
     a generic and extensible framework by which SIP nodes can request
     notification from remote nodes indicating that certain events
     have occured.

     Concrete uses of the mechanism described in this document may be
     standardized in the future.

1. Introduction

     The ability to request asynchronous notification of events proves
     useful in many types of services for which cooperation between
     end-nodes is required. An example of such a service is defined in
     "Automatic Call Back Service in SIP" [2] .

     The methods described in this document allow a framework by which
     notification of these events can be ordered.

2. New Methods

     This document describes two new SIP methods: "SUBSCRIBE" and
     "NOTIFY." Note that these methods have been defined elsewhere.
     This document attempts, as much as possible, to remain compatible
     with those proposals; however, some minor adjustments may be
     necessary due to the marked lack of extensibility present in
     other existing drafts.

     This table expands on tables 4 and 5 in RFC 2543 [1] .

Internet Draft         Event Notification in SIP              March 2000



2.1. SUBSCRIBE method

     "SUBSCRIBE" is added to the definition of the element "Method" in
     the SIP message grammar.

     The SUBSCRIBE method is used to request notification of an event
     or set of events at a later time.

2.2. NOTIFY method

     "NOTIFY" is added to the definition of the element "Method" in
     the SIP message grammar.

     The NOTIFY method is used to notify a SIP node that an event
     which has been requested by an eariler SUBSCRIBE method has
     occured. It may also provide further details about the event.

3. New "Event" header

     The following header is added for the purposes of this extension.

     Event       =  "Event" ":" 1#event-type
     event-type  =  token


     Event is added to the definition of the element "general-header"
     in the SIP message grammar.

     This document does not define values for event-types. These
     values will be defined in further extensions that take advantage
     of the SUBCRIBE and NOTIFY methods.

4. Node Behavior

     Unless noted otherwise, call-member SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests
     follow the same protocol rules governing the usage of tags,
     Route, Record-Route, retransmission, reliability, CSeq handling,
     and message formatting as those defined in RFC 2543 [1] for BYE.

     Similarly, unless noted otherwise, third-party SUBSCRIBE and
     NOTIFY requests follow the same protocol rules as those defined
     in RFC 2543 [1] for OPTIONS.

     For the purposes of generality, both SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY MAY be
     canceled; however, doing so is not recommended. Sucessfully
     cancelled SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests MUST be completed with a
     "487 Request Cancelled" response; the server acts as if the
     request were never received.




Roach                                                           [Page 4]

Internet Draft         Event Notification in SIP              March 2000


     SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY have two slightly different uses: (1)
     subscription to and notification of events by nodes which are
     involved in an ongoing call with the node from which notification
     is being ordered, and (2) subscription to and notification of
     events by nodes which are not actively involved as an endpoint in
     an ongoing call with the node from which notification is being
     ordered. For the purposes of brevity, these situations will be
     refered to as "call-member" and "third-party" respectively.

     Further, third-party SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY requests may relate to
     call-related events (e.g. call-terminated) or resource-related
     events (e.g. terminal-free).

4.1. SUBSCRIBE

4.1.1. Correlation to legs, calls, and terminals

     Call-member SUBSCRIBE requests will be correlated in the same way
     that any other call-related request is (e.g. BYE) using To, From,
     and Call-ID; these subscriptions will generally be used to
     request information about the specific call.

     Third-party SUBSCRIBE requests will not correlate to any existing
     call leg in the server. The Call-ID of resource-related requests
     will be unique to the SUBSCRIBE and any subsequent NOTIFY
     requests.

     Third-party SUBSCRIBE requests may also request information about
     call-related events by specifying a Call-ID that is known to have
     significance to the UAS. Proxies in the call-setup path may
     obtain this Call-ID by examining the messages they proxy; other
     methods of obtaining the Call-ID of an ongoing call are outside
     the scope of this document.

     Note that third-party subscriptions have security implications;
     see section 7.

4.1.2. Subscription duration

     All SUBSCRIBE requests are required to contain an "Expires"
     header. This header specifies for how long the subscription is to
     remain in effect. The 200 response to a SUBSCRIBE request also
     MUST contain an "Expires" header. The period of time in the
     response MAY be shorter than specified in the request, but MUST
     NOT be longer. The period of time in the response is the one
     which defines the duration of the subscription.

     Simlar to REGISTER requests, SUBSCRIBE requests may be renewed at
     any time to prevent them from expiring at the end of the
     "Expires" period. These renewals will contain a the same "To,"



Roach                                                           [Page 5]

Internet Draft         Event Notification in SIP              March 2000


     "From," and "Call-ID" as the original request, and an incremented
     "CSeq" number. Subscriptions may similarly be cancelled by
     re-issuing them with an "Expires: 0" header.

     Further, call-related SUBSCRIBE requests (as opposed to
     resource-related) are automatically expired at the end of the
     call to which they relate (from the point of view of the device
     receiving the SUBSCRIBE request), regardless of the "Expire"
     values in the SUBSCRIBE response.

4.1.3. Events being requested

     SUBSCRIBE requests contain one or more events to which the client
     is attempting to subscribe; these events are listed in the
     "Event" header (see section 3. ). If the server being contacted
     understands the SUBSCRIBE mechanism and is willing to provide the
     types of notification being requested, it will respond with a
     "200 OK." This response will also contain an "Event" header,
     specifying of which events the client will be notified. Note that
     this list will be a subset of the events listed in the SUBSCRIBE
     request. Events that the server does not understand or is
     unwilling to provide notification for MUST NOT appear in the
     response.

     Responses of 400+ to a SUBSCRIBE request should not be considered
     fatal by the UAC; behaviour will be the same as if a blank
     "Event" header were included in a 200 response (i.e. no events
     have been sucessfully subscribed).

     The "Event" header is considered mandatory for the purposes of
     this document. However, to maintain compatibility with existing,
     non-extensible drafts which also make use of SUBSCRIBE, servers
     MAY interpret a SUBSCRIBE request with no "Event" header as
     requesting a subscription to all the events the server is willing
     to report. They MAY alternately return "400 Bad Request."

4.2. NOTIFY

4.2.1. Correlation

     NOTIFY requests MUST contain the same Call-ID, local URI, and
     remote URI as the SUBSCRIBE request which ordered them. This is
     the same definition as a call leg.

4.2.2. Events being reported

     NOTIFY requests will contain an "Event" header with a single
     event-type listed. This event-type will specify which subscribed
     event is being reported. Note that sending a NOTIFY does not
     cancel the SUBSCRIBE which requested it; in other words, a single



Roach                                                           [Page 6]

Internet Draft         Event Notification in SIP              March 2000


     SUBSCRIBE request may trigger several NOTIFY requests.

     Further parameters relating to the event specified in the NOTIFY
     request may be present, as additional headers, in the body, or
     both. The specification of the syntax for these additional
     parameters is outside the scope of this document.

4.3. SIP User Agent Behavior

     User Agent Clients (UACs) are allowed to initiate both
     call-member and third-party SUBSCRIBE requests. Upon receipt of a
     SUBSCRIBE request, servers have the option of confirming the
     request (200 OK) or rejecting it (403 Forbidden). The other
     values defined in RFC 2543 [1] are also allowed, as appropriate.

4.4. SIP Proxy Behavior

     Note that, due to CSeq space collisions, proxies are not allowed
     to initiate call-member SUBSCRIBE requests. They can, however,
     initiate third-party SUBSCRIBE requests to existing calls; they
     would do so by including the Call-ID of an ongoing call. The
     "From:" field in this case, however, would indicate an address
     owned by the proxy, and thus be considered a new leg by the UAS.

5. Open Questions

     Should cancelling a subscription be performed with the
     UNSUBSCRIBE method defined in PINT for the sake of consistency,
     or is the REGISTER model of "Expires: 0" preferable?

6. References

         Session Initiation Protocol", RFC 2543, IETF; March 1999.

7. Security Considerations

     The ability to accept third-party subscriptions should be under
     the direct control of the user, since many types of events may be
     considered sensitive for the purposes of privacy. Similarly, the
     user agent should have the ability to selectively reject
     subscriptions based on the calling party (using either a
     white-list or black-list functionality).
