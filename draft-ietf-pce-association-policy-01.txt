1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element communication
   Protocol (PCEP) which enables the communication between a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Control Element (PCE), or between
   two PCEs based on the PCE architecture [RFC4655].

   PCEP Extensions for Stateful PCE Model [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable active control of
   MPLS-TE and GMPLS tunnels.  [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]
   describes the setup and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs under the
   active stateful PCE model, without the need for local configuration
   on the PCC, thus allowing for a dynamic network.  Currently, the LSPs
   can either be signaled via RSVP-TE or can be segment routed as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing].

   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] introduces a generic mechanism to
   create a grouping of LSPs which can then be used to define
   associations between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as
   configuration parameters or behaviors) and is equally applicable to
   stateful PCE (active and passive modes) and stateless PCE.

   This document specifies a PCEP extension to associate one or more
   LSPs with policies using the generic association mechanism.

   A PCEP speaker may want to influence the PCEP peer with respect to
   path selection and other policies.  This document describes a PCEP
   extension to associate policies by creating Policy Association Group
   (PAG) and encoding this association in PCEP messages.  The
   specification is applicable to both stateful and stateless PCEP
   sessions.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document.

   LSR:  Label Switch Router.

   MPLS:  Multiprotocol Label Switching.

   PAG:  Policy Association Group.

   PCC:  Path Computation Client.  Any client application requesting a
      path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element.  An entity (component, application,
      or network node) that is capable of computing a network path or
      route based on a network graph and applying computational
      constraints.

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Communication Protocol.

3.  Motivation

   Paths computed using PCE MAY be subjected to various policies on both
   PCE and PCC.  For example, in a centralized traffic engineering
   scenario, network operators may instantiate LSPs and specifies
   policies for traffic steering, path monitoring, etc., for some LSPs

   via the stateful PCE.  Similarly, a PCC may request a user- or
   service-specific policy to be applied at the PCE, such as constraints
   relaxation to meet optimal QoS and resiliency.

   PCEP speaker can use the generic mechanism as per
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] to associate a set of LSPs with
   policy, without the need to know the details of such policies, which
   simplifies network operations, avoids frequent software upgrades, as
   well provides an ability to introduce new policy faster.

3.1.  Policy based Constraints

   In the context of policy-enabled path computation [RFC5394], path
   computation policies may be applied at both a PCC and a PCE.
   Consider an Label Switch Router (LSR) with a policy enabled PCC, it
   receives a service request via signaling, including over a Network-
   Network Interface (NNI) or User Network Interface (UNI) reference
   point, or receives a configuration request over a management
   interface to establish a service.  The PCC may also apply user- or
   service-specific policies to decide how the path selection process
   should be constrained, that is, which constraints, diversities,
   optimization criterion, and constraint relaxation strategies should
   be applied in order for the service LSP(s) to have a likelihood to be
   successfully established and provide necessary QoS and resilience
   against network failures.  The user- or service-specific policies
   applied to PCC and are then passed to the PCE along with the Path
   computation request, in the form of constraints [RFC5394].

   PCEP speaker can use the generic mechanism as per
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] to associate a set of LSPs with
   policy and its resulting path computation constraints.  This
   simplified the path computation message exchanges.

4.  Overview

   As per [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group], LSPs are associated with
   other LSPs with which they interact by adding them to a common
   association group.  Grouping can also be used to define association
   between LSPs and policies associated to them.  One new Association
   Type is defined in this document, based on the generic Association
   object -

   o  Association type = TBD1 ("Policy Association Type") for Policy
      Association Group (PAG)

   This Association-Type is operator-configured association in nature
   and created by the operator manually on the PCEP peers.  The LSP
   belonging to this associations is conveyed via PCEP messages to the
   PCEP peer.  Operator-configured Association Range SHOULD NOT be set
   for this association-type, and MUST be ignored, so that the full
   range of association identifier can be utilized.

   A PAG can have one or more LSPs and its associated policy(s).  The
   association identifier, type (Policy), as well as the association
   source IP address is manually configured by the operator and is used
   to identify the PAG.

Internet-Draft                ASSOC-POLICY                     June 2017


   As per the processing rules, as specified in section 5.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group], if a PCEP speaker does not support
   this Policy association-type, it MUST return a PCErr message with
   Error-Type TBD "Association Error" and Error-Value 1 "Association-
   type is not supported".  Since the PAG is opaque in nature, the PAG
   and the policy MUST be set on the PCEP peers.  If a PCE speaker
   receives PAG in a PCEP message, and the association information is
   not configured, it MUST return a PCErr message with Error-Type TBD
   "Association Error" and Error- Value 4 "Association unknown".  All
   other processing is as per section 5.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].

5.  Policy Association Group

   Association groups and their memberships are defined using the
   ASSOCIATION object defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].  Two
   object types for IPv4 and IPv6 are defined.  The ASSOCIATION object
   includes "Association type" indicating the type of the association
   group.  This document add a new Association type -

   Association type = TBD1 ("Policy Association Type") for PAG.

   PAG may carry optional TLVs including but not limited to -

   o  VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV: Used to communicate arbitrary vendor
      specific behavioral information, described in [RFC7470].

6.  Security Considerations

   This document defines one new type for association, which do not add
   any new security concerns beyond those discussed in [RFC5440],
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] in
   itself.

   Some deployments may find policy associations and their implications
   as extra sensitive and thus should employ suitable PCEP security
   mechanisms like [I-D.ietf-pce-pceps].

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Association object Type Indicators

   This document defines the following new association type originally
   defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group].

   Value     Name                        Reference

   TBD1      Policy Association Type     [This I.D.]

8.  Manageability Considerations

8.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   An operator MUST BE allowed to configure the policy associations at
   PCEP peers and associate it with the LSPs.

8.2.  Information and Data Models

   [RFC7420] describes the PCEP MIB, there are no new MIB Objects for
   this document.

8.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

8.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440].

8.5.  Requirements On Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new requirements
   on other protocols.

8.6.  Impact On Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on network
   operations in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440].
