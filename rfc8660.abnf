size = Lh(1)- Ll(1) + 1 + Lh(2)- Ll(2) + 1 + ... + Lh(k)- Ll(k) + 1

j = 1 , temp = 0

temp = temp + Lh(j)- Ll(j) + 1

j = j+1

label = I - temp + Ll(j)

R2 = [1000,5000] as shown in Figure 2.

A = [1000,1999], the incoming label corresponding to 203.0.113.110/32
A = [1000,1999], the incoming label on Node A for 203.0.113.111/32 is
codepoint=120.  So we compare the address family.  Since IPv4 is
A = [1000,1999], the incoming label for 203.0.113.128/30 on Node A is
codepoint=120.  So we compare the address family.  Both are a part of
codepoint=120.  So we compare the address family.  Both are a part of
SRGB = [1000,1999] is the same.  Hence, the incoming label for
address=2001:DB8:3000::100, color=100, SID-List=<S1, S2>, and the
address=192.0.2.60, color=100, SID-List=<S3, S4>, and the Binding-SID
label=1020.

codepoint=140.  Thus, FEC2 wins based on the IPv4 address family
address=192.0.2.70, color=100, SID-List=<S1, S2>, and Binding-SID
label=1021.

address=192.0.2.71, color=100, SID-List=<S3, S4>, and Binding-SID
label=1021.

A = [1000,1999], the corresponding incoming label is 1022.

A = [1000,1999], the corresponding incoming label is 1022.

address=192.0.2.80, color=100, SID-List=<S1, S2>, and Binding-SID
label=1023.

address=192.0.2.81, color=100, SID-List=<S3, S4>, and Binding-SID
label=1023.
