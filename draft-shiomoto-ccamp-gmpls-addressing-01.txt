1. Introduction 
    
   This document describes explains and clarifies addressing and 
   messaging in networks that use GMPLS [RFC3945] as their control 
   plane. For the purposes of this document it is assumed that there is 
   a one-to-one correspondence between control plane and data plane 
   entities.  That is, each data plane switch has a unique control plane 
   presence responsible for participating in the GMPLS protocols, and 
   that each such control plane presence is responsible for a single 
   data plane switch.  The combination of control plane and data plane 
   entities is referred to as a Label Switching Router (LSR). Various 
   more complex deployment scenarios can be constructed, but these are 
   out of scope of this document. 
    
    
2. Conventions Used in This Document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
    
    
3. Terminology 
    
   Note that the term 'Router ID' is used in two contexts within GMPLS. 
   It may refer to an identifier for a participant in a routing 
   protocol, or it may be an identifier for an LSR that participates in 
   TE routing. These could be considered as the control plane and data 
   plane contexts.

   In this document, the contexts are distinguished by the following 
   definitions. 
    
   Loopback address - A loopback address is a stable IP address of the 
   advertising router that is always reachable if there is any IP 
   connectivity to it [RFC3630].  Thus, for example, an IPv4 127/24 
   address is excluded from this definition. 
    
   TE Router ID - A stable IP address of an LSR that is always reachable 
   if there is any IP connectivity to the LSR, e.g., a loopback address.  
   The most important requirement is that the address does not become 
   unusable if an interface on the LSR is down [RFC3477]. 
    
   Router ID - The OSPF protocol version 2 [RFC2328] defines the Router 
   ID to be a 32-bit network unique number assigned to each router 
   running OSPF.  IS-IS [RFC1195] includes a similar concept in the 
   System ID. This document describes both concepts as the "Router ID" 
   of the router running the routing protocol.  The Router ID is not 
   required to be a reachable IP address, although an operator MAY set 
   it to a reachable IP address on the same system. 
    
   TE link û "A TE link is a representation in the IS-IS/OSPF Link State 
   advertisements and in the link state database of certain physical 
   resources, and their properties, between two GMPLS nodes." [RFC3945] 
    
   Data plane node û A vertex on the TE graph.  It is a data plane 
   switch or router.  Data plane nodes are connected by TE links which 
   are constructed from physical data links.  A data plane node is 
   controlled through some combination of management and control plane 
   actions.  A data plane node may be under full or partial control of a 
   control plane node. 
    
   Control plane node - A GMPLS protocol speaker.  It may be part of a 
   data plane switch or may be a separate computer.  Control plane nodes 
   are connected by control channels which are logical connectionless or 
   connection-oriented paths in the control plane.  A control plane node 
   is responsible for controlling zero, one or more data plane nodes.  
    
   Interface ID û The Interface ID is defined in [RFC3477] and in 
   section 9.1 of [RFC3471]. 
    
    
4. Numbered Addressing 
    
   When numbered addressing is used, addresses are assigned to each node 
   and link in both control and data planes in GMPLS networks.  A TE 
   Router ID is defined to identify the LSR for TE purposes.  It is a 
 
                         Expires October 2005                   [Page 4] 
 
 
               draft-shiomoto-ccamp-gmpls-addressing-01     March 2005                
 
 
   requirement stated in [RFC3477] that the TE Router ID MUST be a 
   reachable address in the control plane. 
    
   The reason why the TE Router ID must be a reachable IP address is 
   because in GMPLS, control and data plane names /addresses are not 
   completely separated.  An Explicit Route Object (ERO) signaled as a 
   part of a Label Switched Path (LSP) setup message contains an LSP 
   path specified in data plane addresses, namely TE Router IDs and TE 
   link IDs.  The message needs to be forwarded as IP/RSVP packet 
   between LSRs that manage data plane nodes along the path.  Hence, 
   each LSR along the path needs to resolve the next hop data plane 
   address into the next hop control plane address before the message 
   could be forwarded to the next hop.  Generally speaking there is a 
   need for a module/protocol that discovers and manages control plane/ 
   data plane address bindings for the address spaces to be completely 
   separated.  In this case, the TE Router ID could be just a network 
   unique number.  Mandating that TE Router ID be a reachable IP address 
   eliminates the need of the mentioned above module û the next hop data 
   plane TE Router ID could be used as a destination for IP packets 
   encapsulating the LSP setup (RSVP Path) message.  Note that every TE 
   link ID could always be resolved to the link originating TE Router 
   ID. 
    
   An IP address MAY also be assigned to each physical interface 
   connected to the control plane network.  Both numbered and unnumbered 
   links in the control plane MAY be supported.  The control channels 
   are advertised by the routing protocol as normal links, which allows 
   the routing of RSVP-TE and other control messages between the LSRs 
   over the control plane network. 
    
   A physical interface address or a physical interface identifier is 
   assigned to each physical interface connected to the data plane. An 
   interface address or an interface identifier is logically assigned to 
   each TE-link end associated with the physical data channel in the 
   GMPLS domain.  A TE link may be installed as a logical interface.   
    
   A numbered link is identified by a network unique identifier (e.g., 
   an IP address) and an unnumbered link is identified by the 
   combination of TE Router ID and a node-unique Interface ID. The 
   existence of both numbered and unnumbered links in the data plane 
   SHOULD be accepted. The recommended addressing for the numbered and 
   unnumbered links is also suggested in this document. 
    
4.1. Interior Gateway Protocols 
    
   We address in this section unnumbered addressing using two Interior 
   Gateway Protocols (IGPs) that have extensions defined for GMPLS: 
   OSPF-TE and IS-IS/TE [RFC3784].

4.1.1. Router Address 
    
   The Router Address is advertised in OSPF-TE using the Router Address 
   TLV structure [RFC3630]. 
    
   It is referred to as the Addressing Router that is advertised in IS-
   IS [RFC1195].  
    
   The IGP protocols use this as a means to advertise the TE Router ID. 
   The TE Router ID is used in constrained-based path computation. 
    
4.1.2. Link ID sub-TLV 
    
   The Link ID sub-TLV [RFC3630] advertises the Router ID of the remote 
   end of the TE link.  For point-to-point links, this is the Router ID 
   of the neighbor.  Multi-access links are left for further study.  
    
   Note that there is no correspondence in IS-IS to the Link ID sub-TLV 
   in OSPF-TE. 
    
4.1.3. Local Interface IP Address 
    
   The Local Interface IP Address is advertised in: 
   - the Local Interface IP Address sub-TLV in OSPF-TE  
   - the IPv4 Interface Address sub-TLV in IS-IS/TE 
    
   This is the ID of the local end of the numbered TE link.  It MUST be 
   a network unique number.  
    
4.1.4. Remote Interface IP Address 
    
   The Remote Interface IP Address is advertised in: 
   - the Remote Interface IP Address sub-TLV in OSPF-TE  
   - the IPv4 Neighbor Address sub-TLV in IS-IS/TE 
    
   This is the ID of the remote end of the numbered TE link.  It MUST be 
   a network unique number.  
     
4.2. Use of Addresses in RSVP-TE 
    
4.2.1. IP Tunnel End Point Address in Session Object 
    
   The IP tunnel end point address of the Session Object is either an 
   IPv4 or IPv6 address.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the IP tunnel endpoint address in the Session 
   Object [RFC3209] be set to the TE Router ID of the egress since the 
   TE Router ID is a unique routable ID per node. 
    
   Alternatively, the tunnel end point address MAY also be set to the 
   destination data plane address if the ingress knows that address or 
   the TE Router ID. 
    
4.2.2. IP Tunnel Sender Address in Sender Template Object 
    
   The IP tunnel sender address of the Sender Template Object is also 
   either an IPv4 or IPv6 address. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that the IP tunnel sender address in the Sender 
   Template Object [RFC3209] specifies the TE Router ID of the ingress 
   since the TE Router ID is a unique routable ID per node. 
    
   Alternatively, the tunnel sender address MAY also be set to the 
   sender data plane address or the TE Router ID. 
    
4.2.3. IF_ID RSVP_HOP Object for Numbered Interfaces 
    
   1. IPv4/IPv6 Next/Previous Hop Address: the IPv4/IPv6 Next/Previous 
      Hop Address [RFC3473] in the Path and Resv messages specifies the 
      IP reachable address of the control plane interface used to send 
      those messages, or the TE Router ID of the node that is sending 
      those messages. 
    
   2. IPv4/IPv6 address in Value Field of the Interface_ID TLV: In both 
      the Path and Resv messages, the IPv4/IPv6 address in the value 
      field of TLV [RFC3471] specifies the associated data plane local 
      interface address of the downstream data channel belonging to the 
      node sending the Path message and receiving the Resv message.  In 
      the case of bi-directional LSPs, if the interface upstream is 
      different from that downstream, then another TLV including the 
      local interface address of the upstream data channel belonging to 
      the node sending the Path message and receiving the Resv message 
      MAY be also added to the TLV for downstream.  Note that 
      identifiers of both downstream and upstream data channels are 
      specified in each TLV from the viewpoint of the sender of the 
      Path message, in both the sent Path and received Resv messages. 
    
4.2.4. Explicit Route Object (ERO) 
    
   The IPv4/IPv6 address in the ERO provides a data-plane identifier of 
   an abstract node, TE node or TE link to be part of the signaled LSP. 
    
   We describe in section 6 the choice of addresses in the ERO.

4.2.5. Record Route Object (RRO) 
    
   The IPv4/IPv6 address in the RRO provides a data-plane identifier of 
   either a TE node or TE link that is part of the established LSP. 
    
   We describe in section 6 the choice of addresses in the RRO. 
    
4.3. IP Packet Destination Address 
    
   The IP destination address of the packet that carries the RSVP-TE 
   message is a control-plane reachable address of the next hop or 
   previous hop node along the LSP.  It is RECOMMENDED that a stable 
   control plane IP address of the next/previous hop node be used as an 
   IP destination address in RSVP-TE message. 
    
   A Path message is sent to the next hop node.  It is RECOMMENDED that 
   the TE router ID of the next hop node be used as an IP destination 
   address in the packet that carries the RSVP-TE message. 
    
   A Resv message is sent to the previous hop node.  It is RECOMMENDED 
   that the IP destination of a Resv message be any of the following:  
   - The IP source address of the received IP packet containing the 
     Path message, 
   - A stable IP address of the previous node (found out by consulting 
     the TED and referencing the upstream data plane interface, 
   - The value in the received phop field. 
    
4.4. IP Packet Source Address  
    
   The IP source address of the packet that carries the RSVP-TE message 
   MUST be a reachable address of the node sending the RSVP-TE message.  
   It is RECOMMENDED that a stable IP address of the node be used as an 
   IP source address of the IP packet.  In case the IP source address of 
   the received IP packet containing the Path message is used as the IP 
   destination address of the Resv message, setting a stable IP address 
   in the Path message is beneficial for reliable control-plane 
   transmission.  This allows for robustness when one of control-plane 
   interfaces is down. 
    
    
5. Unnumbered Addressing 
    
   In this section, we describe unnumbered addressing used in GMPLS to 
   refer to different objects and their significance.  Unnumbered 
   addressing is supported for a data plane.

5.1. IGP 
    
   Since GMPLS caters to PSC and non-PSC links, a few enhancements have 
   been made to the existing OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE protocols.  The routing 
   enhancements for GMPLS are defined in [GMPLS-RTG], [RFC3784] and 
   [GMPLS-OSPF]. 
    
5.1.1. Link Local/Remote Identifiers in OSPF-TE 
    
   Link Local/Remote Identifiers advertise IDs of an unnumbered TE 
   link's local and remote ends respectively.  Those are numbers unique 
   within the scopes of the advertising LSR and the LSR managing the 
   remote end of the link respectively.  Note that these numbers are not 
   network unique and therefore could not be used as TE link end 
   addresses on their own.  An unnumbered TE link end address is 
   comprised of a Router ID associated with the link local end, followed 
   by the link local identifier [GMPLS-OSPF]. 
    
5.1.2. Link Local/Remote Identifiers in IS-IS/TE 
    
   Link local/remote identifiers in IS-IS/TE are exchanged in the 
   Extended Local Circuit ID field of the "Point-to-Point Three-Way 
   Adjacency" [RFC3373] IS-IS Option type.  The same discussion in 5.1.1 
   applies here. 
    
5.2. Use of Addresses in RSVP-TE  
    
   An unnumbered address used for data plane identification consists of 
   the TE router ID and the associated interface ID.  
    
5.2.1. IF_ID RSVP_HOP Object for Unnumbered Interfaces 
    
   The interface ID field in the IF_INDEX TLV specifies the interface of 
   the data channel for that unnumbered interface. 
    
   In both the Path message and the Resv message, the value of the 
   interface ID in the IF_INDEX TLV specifies the associated local 
   interface ID of the downstream data channel belonging to the node 
   sending the Path message and receiving the Resv message.  In case of 
   bi-directional LSPs, if the interface upstream is different from that 
   downstream, then another IF_INDEX TLV including the local interface 
   ID of the upstream data channel belonging to the node sending the 
   Path message and receiving the Resv message MAY be also added to the 
   IF_INDEX TLV for downstream.  Note that identifiers of both 
   downstream and upstream data channels are specified in each IF_INDEX 
   TLV from the viewpoint of the sender of the Path message, in both 
   sent Path and received Resv messages.

5.2.2. Explicit Route Object (ERO) 
    
   For unnumbered interfaces in the ERO, the interface ID is either the 
   incoming or outgoing interface of the TE-link w/r to the GMPLS-
   capable LSR.   
    
   We describe in section 6 the choice of addresses in the ERO. 
    
5.3. Record Route Object (RRO) 
    
   For unnumbered interfaces in the RRO, the interface ID is either the 
   incoming or outgoing interface of the TE-link w/r to the GMPLS-
   capable LSR. 
    
   We describe in section 6 the choice of addresses in the RRO. 
    
5.4. LSP_Tunnel Interface ID Object 
    
   The LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object includes the LSR's Router ID and 
   Interface ID as described in [RFC3477] to specify an unnumbered 
   Forward Adjacency Interface ID. The Router ID of the GMPLS-capable 
   LSR MUST be set to the TE router ID. 
    
    
6. RSVP-TE Message Content 
    
6.1. ERO and RRO Addresses 
    
6.1.1. Strict Subobject in ERO 
    
   Implementations making limited assumptions about the content of an 
   ERO when processing a received Path message may cause 
   interoperability issues. 
    
   A subobject in the Explicit Route Object (ERO) includes an address 
   specifying an abstract node (i.e., a group of nodes), a simple 
   abstract node (i.e., a specific node), or a specific interface of a 
   TE-link in the data plane, depending on the level of control required 
   [RFC3209]. 
    
   In case one subobject is strict, any of the following options are 
   valid: 
   1. Address or AS number specifying a group of nodes 
   2. TE Router ID 
   3. Incoming TE link ID 
   4. Outgoing TE link ID optionally followed by one or two Label sub-
      objects

   5. Incoming TE link ID and Outgoing TE link ID optionally followed by 
      one or two Label sub-objects 
   6. TE Router ID and Outgoing TE link ID optionally followed by one or 
      two Label sub-objects 
   7. Incoming TE link ID, TE Router ID and Outgoing TE link ID 
      optionally followed by one or two Label sub-objects 
    
   The label value that identifies a single unidirectional resource 
   between two nodes may be different from the perspective of upstream 
   and downstream nodes.  This is typical in the case of fiber 
   switching, because the label value is a number indicating the 
   port/fiber. This is also possible in case of lambda switching, 
   because the label value is a number indicating the lambda, but may 
   not be the value directly indicating the wavelength value (e.g., 1550 
   nm). 
    
   The value of a label in RSVP-TE object MUST indicate the value from 
   the perspective of the sender of the object/TLV [RFC3471].  This rule 
   MUST be applied to all types of object/TLV. 
    
   Therefore, the label field in the Label ERO subobject MUST include 
   the value of the label for the upstream nodeÆs identification of the 
   resource. 
    
6.1.2. Loose Subobject in ERO 
    
   There are two differences between Loose and Strict subobject. 
    
   A subobject marked as a loose hop in an ERO MUST NOT be followed by a 
   subobject indicating a label value [RFC3473]. 
    
   A subobject marked as a loose hop in an ERO SHOULD never include an 
   identifier (i.e., address or ID) of outgoing interface. 
    
   There is no way to specify in the ERO whether a subobject is 
   associated with the incoming or outgoing TE link.  This is 
   unfortunate because the address specified in a loose subobject is 
   used as a target for the path computation, and there is a big 
   difference for the path selection process whether the intention is to 
   reach the target node over the specified link (the case of incoming 
   TE link) or to reach the node over some other link, so that it would 
   be possible to continue the path to its final destination over the 
   specified link (the case of outgoing TE link). 
    
   In the case where a subobject in an ERO is marked as a loose hop and 
   identifies an interface, the subobject SHOULD include the address of 
   the Incoming interface specifying the TE-link in the data plane.

6.1.3. RRO 
    
   When a node adds one or more subobjects to an RRO and sends the Path 
   or the Resv message including the RRO for the purpose of recording 
   the node's addresses used for an LSP, the subobjects (i.e. number, 
   each type, and each content) added by the node SHOULD be the same in 
   the Path ERO and Resv ERO.  The intention is that they report the 
   path of the LSP, and that the operator can use the results 
   consistently.  At any transit node, it SHOULD be possible to 
   construct the path of the LSP by joining together the RRO from the 
   Path and the Resv messages. 
    
   It is also important that a whole RRO on a received Resv message can 
   be used as input to an ERO on a Path message. 
    
   Therefore, in case that a node adds one or more subobjects to an RRO, 
   any of the following options are valid: 
   1. TE Router ID 
   2. Incoming TE link ID 
   3. Outgoing TE link ID optionally followed by one or two Label sub-
      objects 
   4. Incoming TE link ID and Outgoing TE link ID optionally followed by 
      one or two Label sub-objects 
   5. TE Router ID and Outgoing TE link ID optionally followed by one or 
      two Label sub-objects 
   6. Incoming TE link ID, TE Router ID and Outgoing TE link ID 
      optionally followed by one or two Label sub-objects 
    
   Option (4) is RECOMMENDED considering the importance of the record 
   route information to the operator. 
    
6.2. Forwarding Destination of Path Message with ERO 
    
   The final destination of the Path message is the Egress node that is 
   specified by the tunnel end point address in the Session object. 
   The Egress node MUST NOT forward the corresponding Path message 
   downstream, even if the ERO includes the outgoing interface ID of the 
   Egress node for the Egress control [RFC4003]. 
    
    
7. GMPLS Control Plane 
    
7.1. Control Channel Separation 
    
   In GMPLS, a control channel can be separated from the data channel 
   and there is not necessarily a one-to-one association of a control 
   channel to a data channel. Two adjacent nodes may have multiple IP 
   hops between them in the control plane. 
 
                         Expires October 2005                  [Page 12] 
 
 
               draft-shiomoto-ccamp-gmpls-addressing-01     March 2005                
 
 
    
   There are two broad types of separated control planes: native and 
   tunneled.  These differ primarily in the nature of encapsulation used 
   for signaling messages, which also results in slightly different 
   address handling with respect to the control plane address.  
    
7.2. Native and Tunneled Control Plane 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that all implementations support a native control 
   plane.  
    
   If the control plane interface is unnumbered, the RECOMMENDED value 
   for the control plane address is the TE Router-ID. 
    
   For the case where two adjacent nodes have multiple IP hops between 
   them in the control plane, then as stated in section 9 of [RFC3945], 
   implementations SHOULD use the mechanisms of section 8.1.1 of [MPLS-
   HIER] whether they use LSP Hierarchy or not.  Note that section 8.1.1 
   of [MPLS-HIER] applies for "FA-LSP" as stated in that section but 
   also to "TE-LINK" for the case where a normal TE link is used.  
   Note also that a hop MUST NOT decrement the TTL of the received RSVP-
   TE message. 
    
   For a tunneled control plane, the inner RSVP and IP messages traverse 
   exactly one IP hop.  The IP TTL of the outermost IP header SHOULD be 
   the same as for any network message sent on that network.  
   Implementations receiving RSVP-TE messages on the tunnel interface 
   MUST NOT compare the RSVP TTL to either of the IP TTLs received.   
   Implementations MAY set the RSVP TTL to be the same as the IP TTL in 
   the innermost IP header. 
    
7.3. Separation of Control and Data Plane Traffic 
    
   Data traffic MUST NOT be transmitted through the control plane.  
    
  
8. Security Considerations 
    
   In the interoperability testing we conducted, the major issue we 
   found was the use of control channels for forwarding data.  This was 
   due to the setting of both control and data plane addresses to the 
   same value in PSC (Packet-Switching Capable) equipment.  This led to 
   major problems that could be avoided simply by keeping the addresses 
   for the control and data plane separate.
