<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The requirements for routing architectures described in this document
      were produced by two sub-groups under the IRTF Routing Research Group in
      2001, with some editorial updates up to 2006. The two sub-groups worked
      independently, and the resulting requirements represent two separate
      views of the problem and of what is required to fix the problem. This
      document may usefully serve as part of the recommended reading for
      anyone who works on routing architecture designs for the Internet in the
      future.
</p>
<p>The document is published with the support of the IRTF RRG as a
      record of the work completed at that time, but with the understanding
      that it does not necessarily represent either the latest technical
      understanding or the technical consensus of the research group at the
      date of publication.

Background</h3>

<p>In 2001, the IRTF Routing Research Group (IRTF RRG) chairs, Abha
      Ahuja and Sean Doran, decided to establish a sub-group to look at
      requirements for inter-domain routing (IDR). A group of well known
      routing experts was assembled to develop requirements for a new routing
      architecture. Their mandate was to approach the problem starting from a
      blank sheet. This group was free to take any approach, including a
      revolutionary approach, in developing requirements for solving the
      problems they saw in inter-domain routing.
</p>
<p>Simultaneously, an independent effort was started in Sweden with a
      similar goal. A team, calling itself Babylon, with participation from
      vendors, service providers, and academia, assembled to understand the
      history of inter-domain routing, to research the problems seen by the
      service providers, and to develop a proposal of requirements for a
      follow-on to the current routing architecture. This group's remit
      required an evolutionary approach starting from current routing
      architecture and practice. In other words the group limited itself to
      developing an evolutionary strategy. The Babylon group was later folded
      into the IRTF RRG as Sub-Group B to distinguish it from the original RRG
      Sub-group A.
</p>
<p>One of the questions that arose while the groups were working in
      isolation was whether there would be many similarities between their
      sets of requirements. That is, would the requirements that grew from a
      blank sheet of paper resemble those that started with the evolutionary
      approach? As can be seen from reading the two sets of requirements,
      there were many areas of fundamental agreement but some areas of
      disagreement.
</p>
<p>There were suggestions within the RRG that the two teams should work
      together to create a single set of requirements. Since these
      requirements are only guidelines to future work, however, some felt that
      doing so would risk losing content without gaining any particular
      advantage. It is not as if any group, for example the IRTF RRG or the
      IETF Routing Area, was expected to use these requirements as written and
      to create an architecture that met these requirements. Rather, the
      requirements were in practice strong recommendations for a way to
      proceed in creating a new routing architecture. In the end the decision
      was made to include the results of both efforts, side by side, in one
      document.
</p>
<p>This document contains the two requirement sets produced by the
      teams. The text has received only editorial modifications; the
      requirements themselves have been left unaltered. Whenever the editors
      felt that conditions had changed in the few years since the text was
      written, an editors' note has been added to the text.
</p>
<p>In reading this document it is important to keep in mind that all of
      these requirements are suggestions, which are laid out to assist those
      interested in developing new routing architectures. It is also important
      to remember that, while the people working on these suggestions have
      done their best to make intelligent suggestions, there are no
      guarantees. So a reader of this document should not treat what it says
      as absolute, nor treat every suggestion as necessary. No architecture is
      expected to fulfill every 'requirement.' Hopefully, though, future
      architectures will consider what is offered in this document.
</p>
<p>The IRTF RRG supported publication of this document as a historical
      record of the work completed on the understanding that it does not
      necessarily represent either the latest technical understanding or the
      technical consensus of the research group at the time of publication.
      The document has had substantial review by members of the two teams,
      other members of the IRTF RRG and additional experts over the years.
</p>
<p>Finally, this document does not make any claims that it is possible
      to have a practical solution that meets all the listed requirements.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1.1"></a><h3>2.1.1.&nbsp;
Architecture</h3>

<p>The new routing and addressing protocols, data structures, and
          algorithms need to be developed from a clear, well thought out,
          documented, architecture.
</p>
<p>The new routing and addressing system must have an architectural
          specification which describes all of the routing and addressing
          elements, their interactions, what functions the system performs,
          and how it goes about performing them. The architectural
          specification does not go into issues such as protocol and data
          structure design.
</p>
<p>The architecture should be agnostic with regard to specific
          algorithms and protocols.
</p>
<p>Doing architecture before doing detailed protocol design is good
          engineering practice. This allows the architecture to be reviewed
          and commented upon, with changes made as necessary, when it is still
          easy to do so. Also, by producing an architecture, the eventual
          users of the protocols (the operations community) will have a better
          understanding of how the designers of the protocols meant them to be
          used.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1.2"></a><h3>2.1.2.&nbsp;
Separable Components</h3>

<p>The architecture must place different functions into separate
          components.
</p>
<p>Separating functions, capabilities, and so forth, into individual
          components and making each component "stand alone" is generally
          considered by system architects to be "A Good Thing". It allows
          individual elements of the system to be designed and tuned to do
          their jobs "very well". It also allows for piecemeal replacement and
          upgrading of elements as new technologies and algorithms become
          available.
</p>
<p>The architecture must have the ability to replace or upgrade
          existing components and to add new ones, without disrupting the
          remaining parts of the system. Operators must be able to roll out
          these changes and additions incrementally (i.e., no "flag days").
          These abilities are needed to allow the architecture to evolve as
          the Internet changes.
</p>
<p>The architecture specification shall define each of these
          components, their jobs, and their interactions.
</p>
<p>Some thoughts to consider along these lines are </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>

                  recovery in the case of constraint satisfaction. In fact,
                  the intended topology is a powerful way to state certain

<p>The architecture should also separate topology, routing, and
          addressing from the application that uses those components. This
          implies that applications such as policy definition, forwarding, and
          circuit and tunnel management are separate subsystems layered on top
          of the basic topology, routing, and addressing systems.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1.3"></a><h3>2.1.3.&nbsp;
Scalable</h3>

<p>Scaling is the primary problem facing the routing and addressing
          architecture today. This problem must be solved and it must be
          solved for the long term.
</p>
<p>The architecture must support a large and complex network.
          Ideally, it will serve our needs for the next 20 years.
          Unfortunately: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>we do not know how big the Internet will grow over that time,
              and
</li>
<li>the architecture developed from these requirements may change
              the fundamental structure of the Internet and therefore its
              growth patterns. This change makes it difficult to predict
              future growth patterns of the Internet.
</li>
</ol>

<p>As a result, we can't quantify the requirement in any meaningful
          way. Using today's architectural elements as a mechanism for
          describing things, we believe that the network could grow to: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>tens of thousands of AS's 
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Editors' Note: As of 2005, this level had already been
                  reached.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>tens to hundreds of millions of prefixes, during the lifetime
              of this architecture.
</li>
</ol>

<p>These sizes are given as a 'flavor' for how we expect the
          Internet to grow. We fully believe that any new architecture may
          eliminate some current architectural elements and introduce new
          ones.
</p>
<p>A new routing and addressing architecture designed for a specific
          network size would be inappropriate. First, the cost of routing
          calculations is based only in part on the number of AS's or prefixes
          in the network. The number and locations of the links in the network
          are also significant factors. Second, past predictions of Internet
          growth and topology patterns have proven to be wildly inaccurate so
          developing an architecture to a specific size goal would at best be
          shortsighted. </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Editors' note: At the time of these meetings, the BGP
              statistics kept at sites such as www.routeviews.org either did
              not exist or had been running for only a few months. After 5
              years of recording public Internet data trends in AS growth,
              routing table growth can be observed (past) with some short term
              prediction. As each year of data collection continues the
              ability to observe and predict trends improves. This
              architecture work pointed out the need for such statistics to
              improve future routing designs.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore we will not make the scaling requirement based on a
          specific network size. Instead, the new routing and addressing
          architecture should have the ability to constrain the increase in
          load (CPU, memory space and bandwidth, and network bandwidth) on ANY
          SINGLE ROUTER to be less than these specific functions: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The computational power and memory sizes required to execute
              the routing protocol software and to contain the tables must
              grow more slowly than hardware capabilities described by Moore's
              Law, doubling every 18 months. Other observations indicate that
              memory sizes double every 2 years or so.
</li>
<li>Network bandwidth and latency are some key constraints on how
              fast routing protocol updates can be disseminated (and therefore
              how fast the routing system can adapt to changes). Raw network
              bandwidth seems to quadruple every 3 years or so. However, it
              seems that there are some serious physics problems in going
              faster than 40Gbit/s (OC768); we should not expect raw network
              link speed to grow much beyond OC768. On the other hand, for
              economic reasons, large swathes of the core of the Internet will
              still operate at lower speeds, possibly as slow as DS3. 
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt> </dt>
<dd>Editors' Note: Technology is running ahead
                  of imagination and higher speeds are already common.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote> Furthermore, in some sections of the Internet even
              lower speed links are found. Corporate access links are often
              T1, or slower. Low-speed radio links exist. Intra-domain links
              may be T1 or fractional-T1 (or slower). <br />
<br />
 Therefore, the architecture must not make
              assumptions about the bandwidth available.
</li>
<li>The speeds of high-speed RAMs (SRAMs, used for caches and the
              like) are growing, though slowly. Because of their use in caches
              and other very specific applications, these RAMs tend to be
              small, a few megabits, and the size of these RAMs is not
              increasing very rapidly. <br />
<br />
 On the other
              hand, the speed of "large" memories (DRAMs) is increasing even
              slower than that for the high speed RAMs. This is because the
              development of these RAMs is driven by the PC market, where size
              is very important, and low speed can be made up for by better
              caches. <br />
<br />
 Memory access rates should not
              be expected to increase significantly. 
<blockquote class="text">
<p>Editors' Note: Various techniques have significantly
                  increased memory bandwidth. 800MHz is now possible, compared
                  with less than 100MHz in year 2000. This does not, however,
                  contradict the next paragraph, but rather just extends the
                  timescales somewhat.

</ol>

<p>The growth in resources available to any one router will
          eventually slow down. It may even stop. Even so, the network will
          continue to grow. The routing and addressing architecture must
          continue to scale in even this extreme condition. We cannot continue
          to add more computing power to routers forever. Other strategies
          must be available. Some possible strategies are hierarchy,
          abstraction, and aggregation of topology information.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1.4"></a><h3>2.1.4.&nbsp;
Lots of Interconnectivity</h3>

<p>The new routing and addressing architecture must be able to cope
          with a high degree of interconnectivity in the Internet. That is,
          there are large numbers of alternate paths and routes among the
          various elements. Mechanisms are required to prevent this
          interconnectivity (and continued growth in interconnectivity) from
          causing tables, compute time, and routing protocol traffic to grow
          without bound. The "cost" to the routing system of an increase in
          complexity must be limited in scope; sections of the network that do
          not see, or do not care about, the complexity ought not pay the cost
          of that complexity.
</p>
<p>Over the past several years, the Internet has seen an increase in
          interconnectivity. Individual end sites (companies, customers,
          etc.), ISPs, exchange points, and so on, all are connecting to more
          "other things". Companies multi-home to multiple ISPs, ISPs peer
          with more ISPs, and so on. These connections are made for many
          reasons, such as getting more bandwidth, increased reliability and
          availability, policy, and so on. However, this increased
          interconnectivity has a price. It leads to more scaling problems as
          it increases the number of AS paths in the networks.
</p>
<p>Any new architecture must assume that the Internet will become a
          denser mesh. It must not assume, nor can it dictate, certain
          patterns or limits on how various elements of the network
          interconnect.
</p>
<p>Another facet of this requirement is that there may be multiple
          valid, loop free, paths available to a destination. See <a class='info' href='#A-multi-path'>Section&nbsp;2.1.7<span> (</span><span class='info'>Multi-path</span><span>)</span></a> for a further discussion.
</p>
<p>We wryly note that one of the original design goals of IP was to
          support a large, heavily interconnected, network, which would be
          highly survivable (such as in the face of a nuclear war).

Random Structure</h3>

<p>The routing and addressing architecture must not place any
          constraints on or make assumptions about the topology or
          connectedness of the elements comprising the Internet. The routing
          and addressing architecture must not presume any particular network
          structure. The network does not have a "nice" structure. In the past
          we used to believe that there was this nice
          "backbone/tier-1/tier-2/end-site" sort of hierarchy. This is not so.
          Therefore, any new architecture must not presume any such
          structure.
</p>
<p>Some have proposed that a geographic addressing scheme be used,
          requiring exchange points to be situated within each geographic
          'region'. There are many reasons why we believe this to be a bad
          approach, but those arguments are irrelevant. The main issue is that
          the routing architecture should not presume a specific network
          structure.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1.6"></a><h3>2.1.6.&nbsp;
Multi-homing</h3>

<p>The architecture must provide multi-homing for all elements of
          the Internet. That is, multi-homing of hosts, subnetworks, end-
          sites, "low-level" ISPs, and backbones (i.e., lots of redundant
          interconnections) must be supported. Among the reasons to multi-home
          are reliability, load sharing, and performance tuning.
</p>
<p>The term "multi-homing" may be interpreted in its broadest sense
          -- one "place" has multiple connections or links to another
          "place".
</p>
<p>The architecture must not limit the number of alternate paths to
          a multi-homed site.
</p>
<p>When multi-homing is used, it must be possible to use one, some
          (more than one but less than all), or all of the available paths to
          the multi-homed site. The multi-homed site must have the ability to
          declare which path(s) are used and under what conditions (for
          example, one path may be declared "primary" and the other "backup"
          and to be used only when the primary fails).
</p>
<p>A current problem in the Internet is that multi-homing leads to
          undue increases in the size of the BGP routing tables. The new
          architecture must support multi-homing without undue routing table
          growth.

<a name="rfc.section.2.1.7"></a><h3>2.1.7.&nbsp;
Multi-path</h3>

<p>As a corollary to multi-homing, the architecture must allow for
          multiple paths from a source to a destination to be active at the
          same time. These paths need not have the same attributes. Policies
          are to be used to disseminate the attributes and to classify traffic
          for the different paths.
</p>
<p>There must be a rich "language" for specifying the rules for
          classifying the traffic and assigning classes of traffic to
          different paths (or prohibiting it from certain paths). The rules
          should allow traffic to be classified based upon at least the
          following: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>o </dt>
<dd>IPv6 FlowIDs,
</dd>
<dt>o</dt>
<dd>DSCP values,
</dd>
<dt>o </dt>
<dd>source and/or destination prefixes, or
</dd>
<dt>o </dt>
<dd>random selections at some probability.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>A mechanism is needed that allows operators to plan and manage
          the traffic load on the various paths. To start, this mechanism can
          be semi-automatic or even manual. Eventually it ought to become
          fully automatic.
</p>
<p>When multi-path forwarding is used, options must be available to
          preserve packet ordering where appropriate (such as for individual
          TCP connections).

Convergence</h3>

<p>The speed of convergence (also called the "stabilization time")
          is the time it takes for a router's routing processes to reach a
          new, stable, "solution" (i.e., forwarding information base) after a
          change someplace in the network. In effect, what happens is that the
          output of the routing calculations stabilizes -- the Nth iteration
          of the software produces the same results as the N-1th
          iteration.
</p>
<p>The speed of convergence is generally considered to be a function
          of the number of subnetworks in the network and the amount of
          connections between those networks. As either number grows, the time
          it takes to converge increases.
</p>
<p>In addition, a change can "ripple" back and forth through the
          system. One change can go through the system, causing some other
          router to change its advertised connectivity, causing a new change
          to ripple through. These oscillations can take a while to work their
          way out of the network. It is also possible that these ripples never
          die out. In this situation the routing and addressing system is
          unstable; it never converges.
</p>
<p>Finally, it is more than likely that the routers comprising the
          Internet never converge simply because the Internet is so large and
          complex. Assume it takes S seconds for the routers to stabilize on a
          solution for any one change to the network. Also assume that changes
          occur, on average, every C seconds. Because of the size and
          complexity of the Internet, C is now less than S. Therefore, if a
          change, C1, occurs at time T, the routing system would stabilize at
          time T+S, but a new change, C2, will occur at time T+C, which is
          before T+S. The system will start processing the new change before
          it's done with the old.
</p>
<p>This is not to say that all routers are constantly processing
          changes. The effects of changes are like ripples in a pond. They
          spread outward from where they occur. Some routers will be
          processing just C1, others C2, others both C1 and C2, and others
          neither.
</p>
<p>We have two separate scopes over which we can set requirements
          with respect to convergence: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Single Change <br />
 In this requirement a single change
              of any type (link addition or deletion, router failure or
              restart, etc.) is introduced into a stabilized system. No
              additional changes are introduced. The system must re-stabilize
              within some measure of bounded time. This requirement is a
              fairly abstract one as it would be impossible to test in a real
              network. Definition of the time constraints remains an open
              research issue.
</li>
<li>System-wide <br />
 Defining a single target for maximum
              convergence time for the real Internet is absurd. As we
              mentioned earlier, the Internet is large enough and diverse
              enough so that it is quite likely that new changes are
              introduced somewhere before the system fully digests old
              ones.
</li>
</ol>

<p>So, the first requirement here is that there must be mechanisms
          to limit the scope of any one change's visibility and effects. The
          number of routers that have to perform calculations in response to a
          change is kept small, as is the settling time.
</p>
<p>The second requirement is based on the following assumptions:
          </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>- </dt>
<dd>the scope of a change's visibility and impact
              can be limited. That is, routers within that scope know of the
              change and recalculate their tables based on the change. Routers
              outside of the scope don't see it at all.
</dd>
<dt>- </dt>
<dd>Within any scope, S, network changes are
              constantly occurring and the average inter-change interval is Tc
              seconds.
</dd>
<dt>- </dt>
<dd>There are Rs routers within scope S.
</dd>
<dt>- </dt>
<dd>A subset of the destinations known to the
              routers in S, Ds, are impacted by a given change.
</dd>
<dt>- </dt>
<dd>We can state that for Z% of the changes, within
              Y% of Tc seconds after a change, C, X% of the Rs routers have
              their routes to Ds settled to a useful answer (useful meaning
              that packets can get to Ds, though perhaps not by the optimal
              path -- this allows some 'hunting' for the optimal solution)
              <br />
 X, Y, and Z are yet to be defined.
              Their definition remains a research issue.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>This requirement implies that the scopes can be kept relatively
          small in order to minimize Rs and maximize Tc.
</p>
<p>The growth rate of the convergence time must not be related to
          the growth rate of the Internet as a whole. This implies that the
          convergence time either </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>not be a function of basic network elements (such as prefixes
              and links/paths), and/or
</li>
<li>that the Internet be continuously divisible into chunks that
              limit the scope and effect of a change, thereby limiting the
              number of routers, prefixes, links, and so on, involved in the
              new calculations.

Routing System Security</h3>

<p>The security of the Internet's routing system is paramount. If
          the routing system is compromised or attacked, the entire Internet
          can fail. This is unacceptable. Any new architecture must be
          secure.
</p>
<p>Architectures by themselves are not secure. It is the
          implementation of an architecture; its protocols, algorithms, and
          data structures, that are secure. These requirements apply primarily
          to the implementation. The architecture must provide the elements
          that the implementation needs to meet these security requirements.
          Also, the architecture must not prevent these security requirements
          from being met.
</p>
<p>Security means different things to different people. In order for
          this requirement to be useful, we must define what we mean by
          security. We do this by identifying the attackers and threats we
          wish to protect against. They are: </p>

              identity of other known, trusted, elements of the routing system
              and then using that position of trust for carrying out other
              attacks. Protocols must use cryptographically strong

</dd>
<dt>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks</dt>

<dt>Topology Hiding</dt>

              the desired levels of service connectivity and reachability.
</dd>
<dt>Privacy</dt>
<dd> By "privacy" we mean privacy of
              the routing protocol exchanges between routers.  <br />
<br />
When the routers are on point-to-point links,
              with routers at each end, there may not be any need to encrypt
              the routing protocol traffic as the possibility of a third party
              intercepting the traffic is limited though not impossible. We do
              believe, however, that it is important to have the ability to
              protect routing protocol traffic in two cases: 
<ol class="text">
<li>When the routers are on a shared network, it is possible
                  that there are hosts on the network that have been
                  compromised. These hosts could surreptitiously monitor the
                  protocol traffic.
</li>
<li>When two routers are exchanging information "at a
                  distance" (over intervening routers and, possibly, across
                  administrative domain boundaries). In this case, the
                  security of the intervening routers, links, and so on,
                  cannot be assured. Thus, the ability to encrypt this traffic
                  is important.
</li>
</ol> <br />
 Therefore, we believe that the option to
              encrypt routing protocol traffic is required.
</dd>
<dt>Data Consistency</dt>
<dd> A router should be
              able to detect and recover from any data that is received from
              other routers which is inconsistent. That is, it must not be
              possible for data from multiple routers, none of which is
              malicious, to "break" another router.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>Where security mechanisms are provided, they must use methods
          that are considered to be cryptographically secure (e.g., using
          cryptographically strong encryption and signatures -- no clear text
          passwords!).
</p>
<p>Use of security features should not be optional (except as
          required above). This may be "social engineering" on our part, but
          we believe it to be necessary. If a security feature is optional,
          the implementation of the feature must default to the "secure"
          setting.

Rich Policy</h3>

<p>Before setting out Policy requirements, we need to define the
          term. Like "security", "policy" means many things to many people.
          For our purposes, policy is the set of administrative influences
          that alter the path determination and next-hop selection procedures
          of the routing software.
</p>
<p>The main motivators for influencing path and next-hop selection
          seem to be transit rules, business decisions, and load
          management.
</p>
<p>The new architecture must support rich policy mechanisms.
          Furthermore, the policy definition and dissemination mechanisms
          should be separated from the network topology and connectivity
          dissemination mechanisms. Policy provides input to and controls the
          generation of the forwarding table and the abstraction, filtering,
          aggregation, and dissemination of topology information.
</p>
<p>Note that if the architecture is properly divided into subsystems
          then at a later time, new policy subsystems that include new
          features and capabilities could be developed and installed as
          needed.
</p>
<p>We divide the general area of policy into two sub-categories,
          routing information and traffic control. Routing Information
          Policies control what routing information is disseminated or
          accepted, how it is disseminated, and how routers determine paths
          and next-hops from the received information. Traffic Control
          Policies determine how traffic is classified and assigned to
          routes.

          that any new architecture and protocol must be incrementally
          deployable; ISPs must be able to set up small sections of the new
          architecture, check it out, and then slowly grow the sections.
          Eventually, these sections will "touch" and "squeeze out" the old

<p>The protocols that implement the architecture must be able to

Multi-Protocol</h3>

<p>The Internet is expected to be "multi-protocol" for at least the
          next several years. IPv4 and IPv6 will co-exist in many different
          ways during a transition period. The architecture must be able to
          handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Furthermore, protocols that
          supplant IPv4 and IPv6 may be developed and deployed during the
          lifetime of the architecture. The architecture must be flexible and
          extensible enough to handle new protocols as they arise.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the architecture must not assume any given
          relationships between a topological element's IPv4 address and its
          IPv6 address. The architecture must not assume that all topological
          elements have IPv4 addresses/prefixes, nor can it assume that they
          have IPv6 addresses/prefixes.
</p>
<p>The architecture should allow different paths to the same
          destination to be used for different protocols, even if all paths
          can carry all protocols.

<p>In addition to the addressing technology, the architecture need

Simplicity</h3>

<p>The architecture must be simple enough so that someone who is
          extremely knowledgeable in routing and who is skilled at creating
          straightforward and simple explanations can explain all the
          important concepts in less than an hour.
</p>
<p>This criterion has been chosen since developing an objective
          measure of complexity for an architecture can be very difficult and
          is out of scope for this document.
</p>
<p>The requirement is that the routing architecture be kept as
          simple as possible. This requires careful evaluation of possible
          features and functions with a merciless weeding out of those that
          "might be nice" but are not necessary.
</p>
<p>By keeping the architecture simple, the protocols and software

          turn leads to:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol class="text">
<li>Faster implementation of the protocols. If there are fewer
              bells and whistles, then there are fewer things that need to be

<li>More reliable implementations. With fewer components, there
              is less code, reducing bug counts, and fewer interactions

Robustness</h3>

Media Independence</h3>

<p>While it is an article of faith that IP operates over a wide
          variety of media (such as Ethernet, X.25, ATM, and so on), IP
          routing must take an agnostic view toward any "routing" or

          operating. That is, the new architecture must not be designed to

          scheme.
</p>
<p>The routing architecture must assume, and must work over, the

<p>The routing and addressing architecture can certainly make use of

<a name="rfc.section.2.1.28"></a><h3>2.1.28.&nbsp;
Administrative Entities and the IGP/EGP Split</h3>

<p>We explicitly recognize that the Internet consists of resources
          under control of multiple administrative entities. Each entity must
          be able to manage its own portion of the Internet as it sees fit.
          Moreover, the constraints that can be imposed on routing and
          addressing on the portion of the Internet under the control of one
          administration may not be feasibly extended to cover multiple
          administrations. Therefore, we recognize a natural and inevitable
          split between routing and addressing that is under a single
          administrative control and routing and addressing that involves
          multiple administrative entities. Moreover, while there may be
          multiple administrative authorities, the administrative authority
          boundaries may be complex and overlapping, rather than being a
          strict hierarchy.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, there may be multiple levels of administration, each
          with its own level of policy and control. For example, a large
          network might have "continental-level" administrations covering its
          European and Asian operations, respectively. There would also be
          that network's "inter-continental" administration covering the
          Europe-to-Asia links. Finally, there would be the "Internet" level
          in the administrative structure (analogous to the "exterior" concept
          in the current routing architecture).
</p>
<p>Thus, we believe that the administrative structure of the
          Internet must be extensible to many levels (more than the two
          provided by the current IGP/EGP split). The interior/exterior
          property is not absolute. The interior/exterior property of any
          point in the network is relative; a point on the network is interior
          with respect to some points on the network and exterior with respect
          to others.
</p>
<p>Administrative entities may not trust each other; some may be
          almost actively hostile toward each other. The architecture must
          accommodate these models. Furthermore, the architecture must not
          require any particular level of trust among administrative
          entities.

Quality of Service (QoS)</h3>

          Service (QoS) is not a part of this function and we make no
          requirements with respect to QoS.
</p>
<p>However, QoS is an area of great and evolving interest. It is
          reasonable to expect that in the not too distant future,
          sophisticated QoS facilities will be deployed in the Internet. Any
          new architecture and protocols should be developed with an eye
          toward these future evolutions. Extensibility mechanisms, allowing
          future QoS routing and signaling protocols to "piggy-back" on top of
          the basic routing system are desired.

IP Prefix Aggregation</h3>

<p>There is no specific requirement that CIDR-style IP Prefix

          policies, societal pressure, and the random growth and structure of
          the Internet have all conspired to make prefix aggregation
          extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible. This means that large
          numbers of prefixes will be sloshing about in the routing system and
          that forwarding tables will grow quite big. This is a cost that we
          believe must be borne.
</p>
<p>Nothing in this non-requirement should be interpreted as saying
          that prefix aggregation is explicitly prohibited. CIDR-style IP

Group B - Future Domain Routing Requirements</h3>

<p>It is generally accepted that there are major shortcomings in the
        inter-domain routing of the Internet today and that these may result
        in meltdown within an unspecified period of time. Remedying these
        shortcomings will require extensive research to tie down the exact
        failure modes that lead to these shortcomings and identify the best
        techniques to remedy the situation.
</p>
<p>Changes in the nature and quality of the services that users want
        from the Internet are difficult to provide within the current
        framework, as they impose requirements never foreseen by the original
        architects of the Internet routing system.
</p>
<p>The kind of radical changes that have to be accommodated are
        epitomized by the advent of IPv6 and the application of IP mechanisms
        to private commercial networks that offer specific service guarantees
        beyond the best-effort services of the public Internet. Major changes
        to the inter-domain routing system are inevitable to provide an
        efficient underpinning for the radically changed and increasingly
        commercially-based networks that rely on the IP protocol suite.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Underlying Principles</h3>

<p>Although inter-domain routing is seen as the major source of
        problems, the interactions with intra-domain routing, and the
        constraints that confining changes to the inter-domain arena would
        impose, mean that we should consider the whole area of routing as an
        integrated system. This is done for two reasons: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>- </dt>
<dd>Requirements should not presuppose the solution.
            A continued commitment to the current definitions and split
            between inter- domain and intra-domain routing would constitute
            such a presupposition. Therefore this part of the document uses
            the name Future Domain Routing (FDR).
</dd>
<dt>- </dt>
<dd>It is necessary to understand the degree to which
            inter-domain and intra-domain routing are related within today's
            routing architecture.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>We are aware that using the term "domain routing" is already
        fraught with danger because of possible misinterpretation due to prior
        usage. The meaning of "domain routing" will be developed implicitly
        throughout the document, but a little advance explicit definition of
        the word 'domain' is required, as well as some explanation on the
        scope of 'routing'.
</p>
<p>This document uses "domain" in a very broad sense, to mean any
        collection of systems or domains that come under a common authority
        that determines the attributes defining, and the policies controlling,
        that collection. The use of domain in this manner is very similar to
        the concept of region that was put forth by John Wroclawski in his
        Metanet model <a class='info' href='#Wroclawski95'>[Wroclawski95]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wroclowski, J., &ldquo;The Metanet White Paper - Workshop on Research Directions for           the Next Generation Internet,&rdquo; 1995.</span><span>)</span></a>. The idea includes
        the notion that certain attributes will characterize the behavior of
        the systems within a domain and that there will be borders between
        domains. The idea of domain presented here does not presuppose that
        two domains will have the same behavior. Nor does it presuppose
        anything about the hierarchical nature of domains. Finally, it does
        not place restrictions on the nature of the attributes that might be
        used to determine membership in a domain. Since today's routing
        domains are an example of the concept of domains in this document,
        there has been no attempt to create a new term.
</p>
<p>Current practice in routing system design stresses the need to
        separate the concerns of the control plane and the forwarding plane in
        a router. This document will follow this practice, but we still use
        the term "routing" as a global portmanteau to cover all aspects of the
        system. Specifically, however, routing will be used to mean the
        process of discovering, interpreting, and distributing information
        about the logical and topological structure of the network.

Inter-domain and Intra-domain</h3>

<p>Throughout this section the terms intra-domain and inter-domain
          will be used. These should be understood as relative terms. In all
          cases of domains, there will be a set of network systems that are
          within that domain; routing between these systems will be termed
          intra-domain. In some cases there will be routing between domains,
          which will be termed inter-domain. It is possible that the routing
          exchange between two network systems can be viewed as intra-domain
          from one perspective and as inter-domain from another
          perspective.

<p>Philosophically, the Internet has the mission of transferring
          information from one place to another. Conceptually, this
          information is rarely organised into conveniently sized,
          IP-addressed packets, and the FDR needs to consider how the
          information (content) to be carried is identified, named and
          addressed. Routing techniques can then be adapted to handle the
          expected types of content.

<p>Many of today's routing problems are caused by a routing system

            is trying to support. Our goal is to develop a routing

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.3.2.&nbsp;
Supporting a Range of Different Communication Services</h3>

<p>Today's routing protocols only support a single data forwarding
            service that is typically used to deliver a best-effort service in
            the public Internet. On the other hand, DiffServ for example, can
            construct a number of different bit transport services within the
            network. Using some of the per-domain behaviors (PDB)s that have
            been discussed in the IETF, it is possible to construct services
            such as Virtual Wire <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-diffserv-pdb-vw'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;diffserv&#8209;pdb&#8209;vw]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Jacobson, V., Nichols, K., and K. Poduri, &ldquo;The 'Virtual Wire' Behavior Aggregate,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> and Assured Rate <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-diffserv-pdb-ar'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;diffserv&#8209;pdb&#8209;ar]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Seddigh, N., Nandy, B., and J. Heinanen, &ldquo;An Assured Rate Per-Domain Behaviour for Differentiated           Services,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Providers today offer rudimentary promises about traffic
            handling in the network, for example delay and long-term packet
            loss guarantees. As time goes on, this becomes even more relevant.
            Communicating the service characteristics of paths in routing
            protocols will be necessary in the near future, and it will be
            necessary to be able to route packets according to their service
            requirements.
</p>
<p>Thus, a goal of this architecture is to allow adequate
            information about path service characteristics to be passed
            between domains and consequently, to allow the delivery of bit
            transport services other than the best-effort datagram
            connectivity service that is the current common denominator.

            requirements.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we will only know if we have succeeded in this

Separation of Topology Map from Connectivity Service</h3>

<p>It is envisioned that an organization can support multiple

            be of different quality, of different connectivity type, or of
            different protocols (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6). For all these services
            there may be common domain topology, even though the policies
            controlling the routing of information might differ from service
            to service. Thus, a goal with this architecture is to support
            separation between creation of a domain (or organization) topology
            map and service creation.

Separation Between Routing and Forwarding</h3>

<p>The architecture of a router is composed of two main separable
            parts, control and forwarding. These components, while
            inter-dependent, perform functions that are largely independent of
            each other. Control (routing, signaling, and management) is
            typically done in software while forwarding typically is done with
            specialized ASICs or network processors.
</p>
<p>The nature of an IP-based network today is that control and
            data protocols share the same network and forwarding regime. This
            may not always be the case in future networks, and we should be
            careful to avoid building in this sharing as an assumption in the
            FDR.
</p>
<p>A goal of this architecture is to support full separation of
            control and forwarding, and to consider what additional concerns
            might be properly considered separately (e.g., adjacency

Different Routing Paradigms in Different Areas of the Same Network</h3>

<p>A number of routing paradigms have been used or researched, in
            addition to the conventional shortest path by hop count paradigm
            that is the current mainstay of the Internet. In particular,

            various domains.
</p>
<p>Explicitly, one of these routing paradigms should be the
            current routing paradigm, so that the new paradigms will

            attacks. A goal of the FDR system should be to allow traffic to be

The Legacy of RFC1126</h3>

<p>RFC1126 outlined a set of requirements that were used to guide
            the development of BGP. While the network has changed in the years
            since 1989, many of the same requirements remain. A future domain
            routing solution has to support, as its base requirement, the
            level of function that is available today. A detailed discussion
            of RFC1126 and its requirements can be found in <a class='info' href='#I-D.irtf-routing-history'>[I&#8209;D.irtf&#8209;routing&#8209;history]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Davies, E., &ldquo;Analysis of IDR requirements and History,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2006.</span><span>)</span></a>. Those requirements,

<a name="rfc.section.3.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.3.1.1.&nbsp;
Commercial Service providers</h3>

<p>The routing system must take into account the commercial
            service provider's need for secrecy and security, as well as
            allowing them to organize their business as flexibly as
            possible.
</p>
<p>Service providers will often wish to conceal the details of the
            network from other connected networks. So far as is possible, the
            routing system should not require the service providers to expose
            more details of the topology and capability of their networks than
            is strictly necessary.
</p>
<p>Many service providers will offer contracts to their customers
            in the form of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The routing system
            must allow the providers to support these SLAs through traffic
            engineering and load balancing as well as multi-homing, providing
            the degree of resilience and robustness that is needed.
</p>
<p>Service providers can be categorized as: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>- </dt>
<dd>Global Service Providers (GSPs) whose
                networks have a global reach. GSPs may, and usually will, wish
                to constrain traffic between their customers to run entirely
                on their networks. GSPs will interchange traffic at multiple
                peering points with other GSPs, and they will need extensive
                policy-based controls to control the interchange of traffic.
                Peering may be through the use of dedicated private lines
                between the partners or, increasingly, through Internet
                Exchange Points.
</dd>
<dt>- </dt>
<dd>National, or regional, Service Providers
                (NSPs) that are similar to GSPs but typically cover one
                country. NSPs may operate as a federation that provides
                similar reach to a GSP and may wish to be able to steer
                traffic preferentially to other federation members to achieve
                global reach.
</dd>
<dt>- </dt>
<dd>Local Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
                operate regionally. They will typically purchase transit
                capacity from NSPs or GSPs to provide global connectivity, but
                they may also peer with neighbouring, and sometimes distant,
                ISPs.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>The routing system should be sufficiently flexible to
            accommodate the continually changing business relationships of the
            providers and the various levels of trustworthiness that they
            apply to customers and partners.
</p>
<p>Service providers will need to be involved in accounting for
            Internet usage and monitoring the traffic. They may be involved in
            government action to tax the usage of the Internet, enforce social
            mores and intellectual property rules, or apply surveillance to
            the traffic to detect or prevent crime.

Enterprises</h3>

<p>The leaves of the network domain graph are in many cases
            networks supporting a single enterprise. Such networks cover an
            enormous range of complexity. Some multi-national companies own
            networks that rival the complexity and reach of a GSP, whereas
            many fall into the Small Office-Home Office (SOHO) category. The
            routing system should allow simple and robust configuration and
            operation for the SOHO category, while effectively supporting the
            larger enterprise.
</p>
<p>Enterprises are particularly likely to lack the capability to
            configure and manage a complex routing system, and every effort
            should be made to provide simple configuration and operation for
            such networks.
</p>
<p>Enterprises will also need to be able to change their service
            provider with ease. While this is predominantly a naming and
            addressing issue, the routing system must be able to support
            seamless changeover, for example, if the changeover requires a
            change of address prefix, the routing system must be able to cope
            with a period when both sets of addresses are in use.
</p>
<p>Enterprises will wish to be able to multi-home to one or more
            providers as one possible means of enhancing the resilience of
            their network.
</p>
<p>Enterprises will also frequently need to control the trust that
            they place both in workers and external connections through
            firewalls and similar mid-boxes placed at their external
            connections.

Internet Exchange Points</h3>

<p>Peering of service providers, academic networks, and larger

            Exchange Points where many networks are linked together in a
            relatively small physical area. The resources of the exchange may
            be owned by a trusted third party or owned jointly by the
            connecting networks. The routing systems should support such
            exchange points without requiring the exchange point to either
            operate as a superior entity with every connected network
            logically inferior to it or by requiring the exchange point to be
            a member of one (or all) connected networks. The connecting
            networks have to delegate a certain amount of trust to the
            exchange point operator.

Delivering Resilient Service</h3>

<p>The routing system operates at Layer 3 in the network. To achieve
          robustness and resilience at this layer requires that, where
          multiple diverse routes are employed as part of delivering the
          resilience, the routing system at Layer 3 needs to be assured that
          the Layer 2 and lower routes are really diverse. The 'diamond
          problem' is the simplest form of this problem - a layer 3 provider
          attempting to provide diversity buys layer 2 services from two
          separate providers who in turn buy layer 1 services from the same
          provider:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
                          Layer 3 service
                           /           \
                          /             \
                      Layer 2         Layer 2
                    Provider A      Provider B
                          \             /
                           \           /
                          Layer 1 Provider
</pre></div>
<p>Now when the backhoe cuts the trench, the Layer 3 provider has no
          resilience unless he had taken special steps to verify that the
          trench wasn't common. The routing system should facilitate avoidance
          of this kind of trap.
</p>
<p>Some work is going on to understand the sort of problems that
          stem from this requirement, such as the work on Shared Risk Link
          Groups <a class='info' href='#I-D.many-inference-srlg'>[I&#8209;D.many&#8209;inference&#8209;srlg]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Papadimitriou, D. and others, &ldquo;Inference of Shared Risk Link Groups,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>.
          Unfortunately, the full generality of the problem requires diversity
          be maintained over time between an arbitrarily large set of mutually
          distrustful providers. For some cases, it may be sufficient for
          diversity to be checked at provisioning or route instantiation time,
          but this remains a hard problem requiring research work.

Assumptions</h3>

<p>In projecting the requirements for the Future Domain Routing a
        number of assumptions have been made. The requirements set out should
        be consistent with these assumptions, but there are doubtless a number
        of other assumptions that are not explicitly articulated here: </p>
<ol class="text">
<li>The number of hosts today is somewhere in the area of 100
            million. With dial-in, NATs and the universal deployment of IPv6,
            this is likely to become up to 500 million users (see <a class='info' href='#CIDR'>[CIDR]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Telcordia Technologies, &ldquo;CIDR Report,&rdquo; .</span><span>)</span></a>). In a number of years, with wireless
            accesses and different appliances attaching to the Internet, we
            are likely to see a couple of billion (10^9) 'users' on the
            Internet. The number of globally addressable hosts is very much
            dependent on how common NATs will be in the future.
</li>
<li>NATs, firewalls, and other middle-boxes exist, and we cannot
            assume that they will cease being a presence in the networks.
</li>
<li>The number of operators in the Internet will probably not grow
            very much, as there is a likelihood that operators will tend to
            merge. However, as Internet-connectivity expands to new countries,
            new operators will emerge and then merge again.
</li>
<li>At the beginning of 2002, there are around 12000 registered
            AS's. With current use of AS's (for e.g., multi-homing) the number
            of AS's could be expected to grow to 25000 in about 10 years.<a class='info' href='#Broido02'>[Broido02]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Broido, A., Nemeth, E., Claffy, K., and C.

<p>Editors' Note: In the routing report table of August 2006,
                the total number of AS's present in the Internet Routing Table
                was 23000. In 4 years this is substantial progress on the
                prediction of 25000 AS's. Also, there are significantly more
                AS's registered then are visibly active, i.e., in excess of
                42000 in mid-2006. It is possible, however, that many are
                being used internally.

</li>
<li>In contrast to the number of operators, the number of domains
            is likely to grow significantly. Today, each operator has
            different domains within an AS, but this also shows in SLAs and
            policies internal to the operator. Making this globally visible
            would create a number of domains 10-100 times the number of AS's,
            i.e., between 100,000 and 1,000,000.
</li>
<li>With more and more capacity at the edge of the network the IP
            network will expand. Today there are operators with several
            thousands of routers, but this is likely to be increased. Some
            domains will probably contain tens of thousands of routers.
</li>
<li>The speed of connections in the (fixed) access will technically
            be (almost) unconstrained. However, the cost for the links will
            not be negligible so that the apparent speed will be effectively
            bounded. Within a number of years some will have multi-gigabit
            speed in the access.
</li>
<li>At the same time, the bandwidth of wireless access still has a
            strict upper-bound. Within the foreseeable future each user will
            have only a tiny amount of resources available compared to fixed
            accesses (10kbps to 2Mbps for UMTS with only a few achieving the
            higher figure as the bandwidth is shared between the active users
            in a cell and only small cells can actually reach this speed, but
            11Mbps or more for wireless LAN connections). There may also be
            requirements for effective use of bandwidth as low as 2.4 Kbps or
            lower, in some applications.
</li>
<li>Assumptions 7 and 8 taken together suggest a minimum span of
            bandwidth between 2.4 kbps to 10 Gbps.
</li>
<li>The speed in the backbone has grown rapidly, and there is no
            evidence that the growth will stop in the coming years.
            Terabit-speed is likely to be the minimum backbone speed in a
            couple of years. The range of bandwidths that need to be
            represented will require consideration on how to represent the
            values in the protocols.
</li>
<li>There have been discussions as to whether Moore's law will
            continue to hold for processor speed. If Moore's law does not
            hold, then communication circuits might play a more important role
            in the future. Also, optical routing is based on circuit
            technology, which is the main reason for taking 'circuits' into
            account when designing an FDR.
</li>
<li>However, the datagram model still remains the fundamental model
            for the Internet.
</li>
<li>The number of peering points in the network is likely to grow,
            as multi-homing becomes important. Also traffic will become more
            locally distributed, which will drive the demand for local
            peering.

<p>Editors' note: On the other hand peer to peer networking
                may shift the balance in demand for local peering.

<p>Most layer 3 routing protocols have utilized keepalives or
              'hello' protocols as a means of detecting failures at Layer 3.
              The keepalive mechanisms are often complemented by analog
              mechanisms (e.g., laser light detection) and hardware mechanisms
              (e.g., hardware/software watchdogs) that are built into routing
              nodes and communication links. Great care must be taken to make
              best possible use of the various failure repair methods
              available whilst ensuring that only one repair mechanism at a
              time is allowed to repair any given fault. Interactions between,
              for example, fast reroute mechanisms at layer 3 and SONET/SDH
              repair at Layer 1 are highly undesirable and are likely to cause
              problems in the network.

<p>There has been very little data or statistical evidence for many of
        the performance claims made in the past. In recent years, several
        efforts have been initiated to gather data and do the analyses
        required to make scientific assessments of performance issues and
        requirements. In order to complete this section of the requirements
        analysis, the data and analyses from these studies needs to be
        gathered and collated into this document. This work has been started
        but has yet to be completed.

Backwards Compatibility (Cutover) and Maintainability</h3>

<p>This area poses a dilemma. On one hand it is an absolute
        requirement that: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>R(55)</dt>
<dd>The introduction of the routing system must
            not require any flag days.
</dd>
<dt>R(56)</dt>
<dd>The network currently in place must continue
            to run at least as well as it does now while the new network is
            being installed around it.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>However, at the same time, it is also an requirement that: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>R(57)</dt>
<dd>The new architecture must not be
            limited by the restrictions that plague today's network.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>It has to be admitted that R(57) is not a well defined requirement,
        because we have not fully articulated what the restrictions might be.
        Some of these restrictions can be derived by reading the discussions
        for the positive requirements above. It would be a useful exercise to
        explicitly list all the restrictions and irritations that we wish to
        do away with. It would be further useful to determine if these
        restrictions can currently be removed at reasonable cost or whether we
        are actually condemned to live with them.
</p>
<p>Those restrictions cannot be allowed to become permanent baggage on
        the new architecture. If they do, the effort to create a new system
        will come to naught. It may, however, be necessary to live with some
        of them temporarily for practical reasons while providing an
        architecture which will eventually allow them to be removed. 
        The last three requirements have significance not only for the
        transition strategy, but also for the architecture itself. They imply
        that it must be possible for an internet such as today's
        BGP-controlled network, or one of its AS's, to exist as a domain
        within the new FDR.

Security Requirements</h3>

<p>As previously discussed, one of the major changes that has
        overtaken the Internet since its inception is the erosion of trust
        between end users making use of the net, between those users and the
        suppliers of services, and between the multiplicity of providers.
        Hence security, in all its aspects, will be much more important in the
        FDR.
</p>
<p>It must be possible to secure the routing communication. </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>R(58)</dt>
<dd>The communicating entities must be able to
            identify who sent and who received the information
            (authentication).
</dd>
<dt>R(59)</dt>
<dd>The communicating entities must be able to
            verify that the information has not been changed on the way
            (integrity).
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>Security is more important in inter-domain routing where the
        operator has no control over the other domains, than in intra-domain
        routing where all the links and the nodes are under the administration
        of the operator and can be expected to share a trust relationship.
        This property of intra-domain trust, however, should not be taken for
        granted: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>R(60)</dt>
<dd>Routing communications must be secured by
            default, but an operator must have the option to relax this
            requirement within a domain where analysis indicates that other
            means (such as physical security) provide an acceptable
            alternative.
</dd>
<dt>R(61)</dt>
<dd>The routing communication mechanism must be
            robust against denial-of-service attacks.

<p></p>

<dt>R(62)</dt>
<dd>It should be possible to verify that the originator of the
            information was authorized to generate the information.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>Further considerations that may impose further requirements
        include: </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>- </dt>
<dd>whether no one else but the intended recipient is
            able to access (privacy) or understand (confidentiality) the

<dd>whether it is possible to verify that all the

<dd>whether there is a need to separate security of

</dd>
<dt>- </dt>
<dd>whether traffic flow security is needed (i.e.,
            whether there is value in concealing who can connect to whom, and
            what volumes of data are exchanged).
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>Securing the BGP session, as done today, only secures the exchange
        of messages from the peering domain, not the content of the
        information. In other words, we can confirm that the information we
        got is what our neighbor really sent us, but we do not know whether
        this information (that originated in some remote domain) is true or
        not.
</p>
<p>A decision has to be made on whether to rely on chains of trust (we
        trust our peers who trust their peers who..), or whether we also need
        authentication and integrity of the information end-to-end. This
        information includes both routes and addresses. There has been
        interest in having digital signatures on originated routes as well as
        countersignatures by address authorities to confirm that the
        originator has authority to advertise the prefix. Even understanding
        who can confirm the authority is non-trivial, as it might be the
        provider who delegated the prefix (with a whole chain of authority
        back to ICANN) or it may be an address registry. Where a prefix
        delegated by a provider is being advertised through another provider
        as in multi-homing, both may have to be involved to confirm that the
        prefix may be advertised through the provider who doesn't have any
        interest in the prefix! </p>

<dt>R(63)</dt>
<dd>The routing system must cooperate with the

<p>This is likely to involve further requirements for abstraction of

Network Modeling</h3>

<p>The mathematical model that underlies today's routing system uses
          a graph representation of the network. Hosts, routers and other
          processing boxes are represented by nodes and communications links
          by arcs. This is a topological model in that routing does not need
          to directly model the physical length of the links or the position
          of the nodes; the model can be transformed to provide a convenient
          picture of the network by adjusting the lengths of the arcs and the
          layout of the nodes. The connectivity is preserved and routing is
          unaffected by this transformation.
</p>
<p>The routing algorithms in traditional routing protocols utilize a
          small number of results from graph theory. It is only recently that
          additional results have been employed to support constraint-based
          routing for traffic engineering.
</p>
<p>The naturalness of this network model and the 'fit' of the graph
          theoretical methods may have tended to blind us to alternative
          representations and inhibited us from seeking alternative strands of
          theoretical thinking that might provide improved results.
</p>
<p>We should not allow this habitual behavior to stop us looking for
          alternative representations and algorithms; topological revolutions
          are possible and allowed, at least in theory.

          that can be discovered in an ongoing effort to model a system such

One, Two or Many Protocols</h3>

<p>There has been a lot of discussion of whether the FDR protocol
          solution should consist of one (probably new) protocol, two (intra-
          and inter-domain) protocols, or many protocols. While it might be
          best to have one protocol that handles all situations, this seems
          improbable. On the other hand, maintaining the 'strict' division
          evident in the network today between the IGP and EGP may be too
          restrictive an approach. Given this, and the fact that there are
          already many routing protocols in use, the only possible answer
          seems to be that the architecture should support many protocols. It
          remains an open issue, one for the solution, to determine if a new
          protocol needs to be designed in order to support the highest goals
          of this architecture. The expectation is that a new protocol will be
          needed.

          server arrangement originates the communication session. Whether a
          new routing system either can or should seek to restore this
          transparency is an open issue.
</p>
<p>A related issue is the extent to which end user applications
          should seek to control the routing of communications to the rest of
          the network.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>We address security issues in the individual requirements. We do
      require that the architecture and protocols developed against this set
      of requirements be "secure". Discussion of specific security issues can

IANA Considerations</h3>

<p>This document is a set of requirements from which a new routing and
      addressing architecture may be developed. From that architecture, a new
      protocol, or set of protocols, may be developed.
</p>
<p>While this note poses no new tasks for IANA, the architecture and
      protocols developed from this document probably will have issues to be
      dealt with by IANA.

 The
          draft is derived from work originally produced by Babylon. Babylon
          was a loose association of individuals from academia, service
          providers and vendors whose goal was to discuss issues in Internet
          routing with the intention of finding solutions for those problems.
          <br />
<br />
 The individual members who contributed
          materially to this draft are: Anders Bergsten, Howard Berkowitz,
          Malin Carlzon, Lenka Carr Motyckova, Elwyn Davies, Avri Doria,
          Pierre Fransson, Yong Jiang, Dmitri Krioukov, Tove Madsen, Olle
          Pers, and Olov Schelen. <br />
<br />
 Thanks also go to
          the members of Babylon and others who did substantial reviews of
          this material. Specifically we would like to acknowledge the helpful
          comments and suggestions of the following individuals: Loa
