             PCEP Link-State extensions for Segment Routing
                  draft-li-pce-pcep-ls-sr-extension-00

Abstract

   Segment Routing leverages source routing.  A node steers a packet
   through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by
   prepending the packet with an SR header.  A segment can represent any
   instruction, topological or service-based.  SR allows to enforce a
   flow through any topological path and service chain while maintaining
   per-flow state only at the ingress node of the SR domain.

   IGP protocols have been extended to advertise the segments.  Because
   of IGP's propagation scope limitation, it is not suited for IGP to
   signal paths that span across AS borders.  This document introduces
   extensions of PCEP-LS to solve the problem without the similar
   limitation.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing] leverages source
   routing.  A node steers a packet through a controlled set of
   instructions, called segments, by prepending the packet with an SR
   header.  A segment can represent any instruction, topological or
   service-based.  SR allows to enforce a flow through any topological
   path and service chain while maintaining per-flow state only at the
   ingress node of the SR domain.

   IGP protocols have been extended to advertise the segments.  Because
   of IGP's propagation scope limitation, it is not suited for IGP to
   signal paths that span across AS borders.

Internet-Draft               PCEP-LS for SR                November 2015


   In order to fulfill the need for applications that require visibility
   of SR paths across IGP areas or even across ASes, this document
   defines extensions for the mechanism introduced in
   [I-D.dhodylee-pce-pcep-ls] to propagate SR information in those
   scenarios that have no IGP SR extension or BGP-LS running.

2.  PCEP extensions for Segment Routing

   PCEP-LS [I-D.dhodylee-pce-pcep-ls] introduces new message type and
   new object to accommodate link-state information in PCEP.  This
   document defines new additional TLVs to map segment routing
   information.  The value portion of these new TLVs can reuse the
   structure defined in [I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions].

2.1.  Node Attribute TLVs

   Some new optional, non-transitive node attribute TLVs are defined for
   carrying segment routing information and are listed below:

+--------------+-----------------------+----------+-----------------------+
|TLV Code Point| Description           |   Length |     Value defined     |
+--------------+-----------------------+----------+-----------------------+
|     TBD1     | SID/Label Binding     | variable | [ISIS-SR]#section2.4  |
+--------------+-----------------------+----------+-----------------------+
|     TBD2     | SR-Capabilities       | variable | [ISIS-SR]#section3.1  |
+--------------+-----------------------+----------+-----------------------+
|     TBD3     | SR-Algorithm          | variable | [ISIS-SR]#section3.2  |

2.2.  Link Attribute TLVs

   Some new optional, non-transitive link attribute TLVs are defined for
   carrying segment routing information and are listed below:

2.3.  Prefix Attribute TLVs

   A new optional, non-transitive link attribute TLVs are defined for
   carrying segment routing information and are listed below:

+--------------+-----------------------+----------+-----------------------+
|TLV Code Point| Description           |   Length |     Value defined     |
+--------------+-----------------------+----------+-----------------------+

3.  Operational Considerations

3.1.  Segment Routing report

   The procedure for segment routing information reporting from PCC to
   PCE will follow those defined in [I-D.dhodylee-pce-pcep-ls].

3.2.  Tunnel Segment Identifier

   Tunnel Segment introduced in [I-D.li-spring-tunnel-segment] is used
   to identify a tunnel of any kind in a segment routing network.  It is
   originated by the tunnel ingress node and one SID is allocated and
   attached to it either locally or globally.

4.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.
