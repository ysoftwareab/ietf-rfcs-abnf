Abstract

   This document creates a registry and defines a procedure to allow
   IETF specifications to register XML Namespace Names with IANA which
   are HTTP URIs and thus potentially useful for looking up information
   about the namespace.

Internet-Draft   HTTP-based IETF Namespace URIs at IANA    February 2008


1.  Introduction

   Many IETF specifications use [XML] with XML Namespaces [Namespaces].
   XML Namespace Names are URIs, and there are many options for
   constructing them.  One of the options is the use of HTTP URIs (those
   whose scheme is "http:").  [RFC3688] created an IANA registry for XML
   namespaces based on URNs, which take on the form
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:foo.  [RFC3470] observes that in the case of
   namespaces in the IETF standards-track documents, it would be useful
   if there were some permanent part of the IETF's own web space that
   could be used to mint HTTP URIs.  However, it seems to be more
   appropriate and in line with IETF practice to delegate such a
   registry function to IANA.  This document proposes such a registry
   with guidelines for its use.  [RFC Editor: Please replace 'proposed
   to do' with 'does' in the previous sentence before publication of
   this document as an RFC.]

   Please send comments on this document directly to the authors, or to
   the mailing list discuss@ietf.org.

1.1.  Notation

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Registry Details

   This section describes the registry in detail.  IANA maintains a
   registry page listing the registered XML namespaces which use HTTP
   URIs.  For each registered namespace, the registry page includes a
   human-readable name for the namespace, a link to the namespace
   document,and the actual namespace URI.

2.1.  Namespace URI Syntax

   Namespaces created by IANA upon registration have the following form.
   There is a common prefix, "http://www.iana.org/xmlns/" (this needs to
   be agreed on with IANA), followed by a unique identifier.

   The unique identifier SHOULD be a relatively short string of US-ASCII
   letters, digits, and hyphens, where a digit cannot appear in first
   position and a hyphen cannot appear in first or last position or in
   successive positions.  In addition, the unique identifier can end in
   a sinle '/' or '#'.  XML namespaces are case-sensitive, but all
   registrations are REQUIRED to mutually differ even under case-
   insensitive comparison.  For uniformity, only lower letters SHOULD be

   used.

   A unique identifier is proposed by the requester, but IANA may change
   it as they see fit, in consultation with the responsible Expert
   Reviewer.

2.2.  Namespace Documents

   For each namespace registered, there MUST be a namespace document in
   either HTML or XHTML which may be retrieved using the HTTP URI which
   is the registered namespace name.  It contains the template
   information with appropriate markup.


3.  Registration Procedure

   The request for creation and registration of a HTTP XML Namespace URI
   is made by including a completed registration template (see
   Section 5) in the IANA Considerations section of an Internet-Draft.
   Registration is limited to namespace names specified in documents
   that go through IESG approval and where change control lies with the
   IETF.

   There is no review procedure separate from the procedure leading to
   IESG approval.  The actual registration is carried out as part of the
   work that IANA does in scanning and processing documents being
   published as RFCs.  HTTP XML Namespace URIs are not intended for work
   in progress, where a namespace independent of IANA MUST be used.

3.1.  Registration Updates

   Occasionally, there may be a need to update a registration.  In
   general, this is done by republishing the specification containing
   the registration.  In this case, the provisions above apply, with
   appropriate adjustments for the fact that this is an update.
   However, a more light-weight process is desirable to fix minor errors
   and to add additional information.

   A registration can be updated by a request to IANA detailing the
   changes to be made (using the template in Section 5 where
   appropriate).


4.  Expert Reviewer

   To help with reviewing registrations, the IETF Application Area
   Directors appoint one or more Expert Reviewers.

5.  Registration Template

   Below is the registration template to be used for registrations, with
   comments for each field.
   Proposed namespace: http://www.iana.org/xmlns/[your component here]

   Human readable title: [Should fit in part of one line]

   Defining document: [draft-foo-bar-99.txt -> RFC XXXX]

   Defining document status: [Standards track, other]

   Additional information: [any helpful additional information]

   In the final document, in the actual namespace document, and for
   updates, "Proposed namespace" is changed to "Namespace".


6.  Benefits of HTTP URIs

   Software which uses XML namespace names typically treats them at
   opaque strings at runtime, using them to decide whether some
   particular markup tokens are to be selected for some particular
   processing.  Such software should have no concern at runtime for the
   URI scheme.  Thus, all properly-registered URI schemes are equally
   suitable for runtime use.

   HTTP URIs are distinguished by being associated with a widely-
   deployed protocol.  They can be used not only to identify, but also
   to retrieve Web Resources.  Thus, a human who recognizes an HTTP URI
   may reasonably attempt to so use it.  Note that this usage is
   entirely unrelated to its runtime use in unambiguously naming markup
   tokens.

   Thus, HTTP URIs have the advantage that they may be usable by humans
   (typically protocol implementors in this context) to educate
   themselves about the nature and purpose of the markup tokens that are
   in the namespace in question.  A subsidiary benefit is that HTTP URIs
   tend to be substantially more human-readable than URNs, and thus more
   memorable.

   Note that the use of an HTTP URI does not constitute an obligation to
   make it dereferencable.  Runtime software MUST NOT depend on whether
   dereferencing is possible.  The advantages only apply to human use
   and in a pedagogic context.

7.  Security Considerations

   The use of HTTP URIs for XML namespace URIs as such does not raise
   any security concerns.  However, care has to be taken to not
   inappropriately creating denial-of-service attacks by applications
   that might automatically try to resolve a namespace URI.

   The security considerations of [STD66] also apply and should be
   considered carefully.


8.  IANA Considerations

   This whole document contains provisions affecting IANA.  We invite
   IANA to study it carefully and to comment on it to make sure that
   IANA's concerns are fully addressed.


9.  Acknowledgments

   Starting with Tim Berners-Lee, many people have suggested that the
   best form of XML Namespace URIs are HTTP URIs.  The actual suggestion
   to write this document is due to Chris Newman, who made it during a
   discussion of namespace URI practice for an Atom extension.
