Abstract

   A pseudowire (PW) is used in Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)
   solutions to form any-to-any connections and provide service
   demuliplexing among Provider Edge routers (PEs), and is normally
   transported over one single network path. Flow-aware PW enable a PW
   to take advantage of Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) and/or Link
   Aggregation Groups (LAG) in a packet switched network (PSN). PW
   packets with a flow label can be transported over multi-paths. This
   method can apply to the PWs in a VPLS service.

   This document describes how VPLS solutions utilize a PW with a flow
   label, and defines protocol extension for the provisioning of such
   PWs.

1. Introduction

   [RFC4664] specifies the Layer 2 virtual private network (L2VPN)
   framework. The L2VPN framework uses a point-to-point (P2P) pseudowire
   (PW) between any pair of Provider Edge routers (PEs) to provide
   connection and service demultiplexing. Each P2P PW is mapped to a
   traffic engineered (TE) tunnel traversing a packet switched network
   (PSN).

   Two popular L2VPN services are Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS)
   and Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS). VPWS is a P2P transport
   service. VPLS is multi-point emulated LAN service. Two standard VPLS
   solutions are specified in [RFC4761] and [RFC4762]. One is BGP-based
   auto-discovery and singling; the other is LDP-based signaling.

   Flow-aware PW [FAT-PW] is developed recently in IETF. It adds a flow
   label on the label stack and enables the distinction of the flows
   within a PW being carried over equal cost multipath (ECMP) and/or a
   link aggregation group (LAG) in a packet switched network (PSN). The
   target application of a PW with a flow label (i.e., of a PW split
   across multiple parallel paths) is to transport large volumes of IP
   traffic between two routers, for example, when providing a VPWS.

   Service Providers use VPLS to provide an emulated LAN service and to
   transport customer Layer 2 frames between Customer Edge routers
   (CEs). Many L2VPN services carry Layer 2 frames that contain IP
   payloads. There is an incentive for a service provider to use the PW
   with a flow label in a VPLS service to support large volumes of data
   between points on the emulated LAN. This document describes a VPLS
   solution that uses a PW with a flow label and defines protocol
   extension for provisioning the PW.

3. VPLS Supported by PW with a Flow Label

   A VPLS is a layer 2 service that emulates an Ethernet LAN across a
   Wide Area Network (WAN). It is a multipoint service. Although VPLS
   service frames are Ethernet frames, and frame forwarding is based on
   the destination MAC address, CE devices may be routers where the
   frame payload is IP data.

   [RFC4761] specifies BGP based auto-discovery and signaling for VPLS
   configuration and operation procedures. [RFC4762] specifies LDP based
   VPLS configuration and operation procedures. Both configure PWs to
   support a VPLS instance, and in both cases the PW cannot be split
   across multiple paths. The extensions in this document are necessary
   for provisioning the PWs with a flow label that can be split across
   multiple paths in a VPLS instance.

   Note: a VPLS service that uses PW with a flow label may have some
   different service aspects in a PSN from the one that does not. It is
   outside the scope of this document how a service provider
   differentiates the service profile between these two cases and how a
   PE classifies the flows for a PW with a flow label.

3.1. RFC4761 Extension for PW with a Flow Label

   [RFC4761] uses BGP to discover PEs in a VPLS instance and configure a
   PW between any pair of PEs in the VPLS instance. [RFC4761] uses VPLS
   BGP Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) to exchange VPLS
   membership and demultiplexers, and uses the "Layer 2 Info Extended
   Community" to signal control information about the PW to be setup for
   a VPLS edge device (VE).

   In this case, if a flow label is to be used to allow the PW to be
   carried over ECMP or a LAG, it is necessary to coordinate the use of
   the flow label between the ingress and egress PE. To signal the
   presence of the flow label in a PW, this document suggests using two
   bits in Control Flags. [RFC4761] has specified "Layer 2 Info Extended
   Community" and Control Flags Bit Vector. This document suggests using
   two bits in Control Flags Bit Vector to signal flow label present
   between the ingress and egress PEs. The suggested format is shown
   below.

           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |   MBZ |T|R|C|S|      (MBZ = MUST Be Zero)
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Name C and S remain the same meaning as [RFC4761]. Name T and R are
   defined here.

   o  When T=1 the PE is requesting the ability to send a PW packet that
      includes a flow label.  When T=0, the PE is indicating that it
      will not send a PW packet containing a flow label.

   o  When R=1 the PE is able to receive a PW packet with a flow label
      present.  When R=0 the PE is unable to receive a PW packet with
      the flow label present.

   The two new bits in Control Flags are used to synchronize the flow
   label state between the ingress and egress PEs. If PE does not
   support flow label, these two bits MUST be set to zero according to
   [RFC4761], which preserves backward compatibility. A PE that uses BGP
   signaling and does not set T bit to 1 MUST NOT include a flow label
   in the PW packet. This preserves backward compatibility with existing
   PW specifications.

   A PE sending a Control Flag with T = 1 to a peer PE and receiving a
   Flow Label Flag with R = 1 from the peer PE SHOULD include a flow
   label in the PW packet. Under all other combinations of Flow Label
   Flag in signaling a PE MUST NOT include a flow label in the PW
   packet.

   The signaling process allows that some PWs in a VPLS instance use a
   flow label on PW packets and other PWs in the same VPLS instance do
   not use flow labels. This provides the flexibility to support network
   migration.

   What is signaled is the desire to include the flow label in the label
   stack.  As [FAT-PW] mentions, the value of the label is a local
   matter for the ingress PE, and the label value itself is not
   signaled.

3.2. RFC4762 Extension for PW with Flow Label

   [RFC4762] uses LDP to provision a VPLS instance and configure an
   Ethernet PW [RFC4448] between every pair of PEs to form a full mesh
   topology among PEs.

   [RFC4762] identified three relevant interface parameters for a VPLS.
   This document adds the Flow Label Sub-TLV defined in [FAT-PW] as a
   relevant interface parameter for a VPLS. When Flow Label Sub-TLV is
   presented in label mapping message, ingress and egress PE MUST
   perform the same procedures described in section 4 of [FAT-PW].

   If LDP signaling [RFC4762] is not in use for PW setup, then whether
   the flow label is used or not MUST be identically provisioned in both
   PEs at the PW endpoints.  If there is no provisioning support for
   this option, the default behavior is not to include the flow label.

   Data forwarding on an Ethernet PW MUST follow the procedures
   described in [RFC4762].

3.3. Virtual Service Instance (VSI) Forwarder

   Each VPLS forms a full mesh among PEs in the VPLS. Every VSI at a PE
   in a given VPLS has exactly one point-to-point PW to every other VSI
   in the same VPLS. MAC address learning is done per PW association,
   i.e., the FIB keeps the mapping of the customer MAC address and PW
   association.[RFC4664]

   When a PW in a VPLS is used with a flow label, the PW still appears
   as one single PW to the VSI. The VSI forwarder function is the same
   as the PW without flow label.[RFC4762] It is worth mentioning the
   case that, if ECMP is used at PEs, the ingress PE may distribute PW
   packets with the flow label to different tunnels; so the egress PE
   gets the packets from different tunnels and pass them to the same PW
   forwarder. The distribution method is local and outside the scope of
   document.

   Flow recognition is discussed in Section 3.4. The VSI forwarder
   SHOULD be able to generate a flow label and process PW encapsulation
   as described in section 3.1 or 3.2.

   It is possible that a VPLS uses point-to-multipoint (P2MP) PWs for
   traffic optimization [P2MP-PW-REQ], [BCAST-EXT]. A P2MP PW with a
   flow label requires that all the egress points can process that flow
   label, which makes harder to synchronize the decision. The solution
   for P2MP is for further study.

3.4. Flow Identification

   A VPLS service transports customer Ethernet frames. When using a PW
   with a flow label, it requires that ingress PE identifies a flow or a
   group of flows within the service so that all frames from any one
   flow are given the same flow label and treated the same way in the

   network. This can be done by parsing the ingress Ethernet traffic and
   considering all of the IP traffic. Source and destination IP address,
   source and destination port, and protocol type may be used to
   identify the flow. Whether the ingress PE uses a PE bridge element or
   VSI forwarder to recognize the flow is a local implementation matter
   and is outside the scope of document.

4. Security Considerations

   The protocol extension in this draft does not introduce any new
   security risk to the services and network beyond the analysis in
   [FAT-PW].

5. IANA Considerations

   Not Any.
