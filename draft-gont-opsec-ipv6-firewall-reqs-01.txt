               Requirements for IPv6 Enterprise Firewalls
                 draft-gont-opsec-ipv6-firewall-reqs-01

Abstract

   While there has been some work in the area of firewalls, concrete
   requirements for IPv6 firewalls have never been specified in the RFC
   series.  The more limited experience with the IPv6 protocols and the
   more reduced number of firewalls that support IPv6 has made it rather
   difficult to infer what are reasonable features to expect in an IPv6
   firewall.  This has typically been a problem for network operators,
   who typically have to produce a "Request for Proposal" from scratch
   that describes such features.  This document specifies a set of
   requirements for IPv6 firewalls, in order to establish some common-
   ground in terms of what features can be expected in them.

1.  DISCLAIMER

   This initial version of the document is based on a typical IPv6
   firewall "Request for Proposal" (RFP), and is mostly meant to trigger
   discussion in the community, and define a direction for the document.
   Future versions of this document may contain all, more, or a subset
   of the requirements present in the current version of this document.
   Additionally, the current version DOES NOT yet properly separate
   requirements among MUST/REQUIRED, SHOULD/RECOMMENDED, and MAY/
   OPTIONAL.

   Please DO read Section 3 of this document, since it provides
   important information about the conventions used throughout this
   document that is mandatory to be able to understand it.

   Finally, please note this version is meant to provide requirements,
   rather than implementation guidelines.

2.  Introduction

   While the IETF has published a large number of documents discussing
   IP and IPv6 packet filtering (see e.g. [RFC7126] and some documents
   on the topic of IP firewalls (see e.g. [RFC2979] and [RFC3511]),
   concrete requirements for IP firewalls have never been specified in
   the RFC series.  When it comes to IPv4, a number of features have
   become common over the years, and firewall requirements have somehow
   become operational wisdom.  When it comes to IPv6 [RFC2460], the more
   limited experience with the protocols, and the reduced variety of
   IPv6 firewalls has made it rather difficult to specify what are
   reasonable features to be expected of an IPv6 firewall.  This has
   proven to be a problem for network operators (who have typically had
   to produce a "Request for Proposal" from scratch), but also for
   vendors (who lack a well defined set of requirements that can serve
   as a roadmap for implementation).

   This situation has not only made the process of purchasing an IPv6
   firewall harder, but at times has also meant that a number of
   important/basic features have remained unimplemented by major
   firewall vendors, or that aforementioned features have not behaved as
   expected.

   This document aims to provide a set of requirements for firewall
   vendors, which are specified as "MUST", "SHOULD", or "MAY".  An IPv6
   firewall product is said to be "fully-compliant" with this
   specification provided it implements all requirements marked as
   "MUST" and "SHOULD".  An IPv6 firewall product is said to be
   "conditionally-compliant" with this specification provided it
   implements all requirements marked as "MUST", but fails to implement
   one or more of the requirements marked as "SHOULD".

3.  Conventions

3.1.  Requirements Language

   Take careful note: Unlike other IETF documents, the key words "MUST",
   "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are not used as
   described in [RFC2119].  This document uses these keywords not




Gont, et al.            Expires October 18, 2014                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Firewalls                   April 2014


   strictly for the purpose of interoperability, but rather for the
   purpose of establishing industry-common baseline functionality.

   In this document, the words that are used to define the significance
   of each particular requirement are capitalized.  These words are:

   o  "MUST" This word, or the words "REQUIRED" and "SHALL" mean that
      the item is an absolute requirement of the specification.

   o  "SHOULD" This word or the adjective "RECOMMENDED" means that there
      may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore this
      item, but the full implications should be understood and the case
      carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

   o  "MAY" This word or the adjective "OPTIONAL" means that this item
      is truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item
      because a particular marketplace requires it or because it
      enhances the product, for example; another vendor may omit the
      same item.

   A firewall implementation is a module that supports at least one of
   the feature types defined in this document.  Firewall implementations
   may support multiple feature types, but conformance is considered
   individually for each type.

   A firewall implementation is not compliant with a specific feature
   type if it fails to satisfy one or more of the MUST requirements of
   such specific feature type.  An implementation that satisfies all the
   MUST and all the SHOULD requirements of a specific feature is said to
   be "unconditionally compliant" with such feature type; one that
   satisfies all the MUST requirements but not all the SHOULD
   requirements is said to be "conditionally compliant" with such
   feature type.

3.2.  Terminology

   Where possible, this document employs the terminology defined in
   [RFC2647].  Other additional terms are defined below:

   session:
      The term session refers to any protocol instance that involves
      some sort of stateful exchange.  Examples of "sessions" could be
      TCP connections, UDP query/response pairs, ICMPv6 echo/response
      pairs, etc.  Our definition of session corresponds to the
      definition of "connection" in Section 3.7 of [RFC2647], but we
      rather employ "session" to avoid possible confusion.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Firewalls                   April 2014


      XXX: Should we just get rid of the term "session" and use
      "connection" throughout this document, with a big reference to the
      definition in RFC2647?

3.3.  Numbering Conventions

   The items for each feature type will follow a monotonically-
   increasing order -- typically in increments to 10.  This is to
   prevent the insertion of an item in the list of requirements to
   change the numbering of all the following requirements.  Prior to the
   final publication of this document, each of items of each the feature
   types will be numbered starting from 1, with increments of 1 (1, 2,
   3, 4, etc.).

      NOTE: Those with BASIC language programming experience may find
      the idea familiar.

4.  General Security Features

   REQ GEN-5:
      The firewall MUST include performance benchmarking documentation.
      Such documentation MUST include information that reflects firewall
      performance with respect to IPv6 packet, but also regarding how
      IPv6 traffic may affect the performance of IPv4 traffic.  The
      aforementioned documentation MUST be, at the very least,
      conditionally-compliant with both [RFC3511] and [RFC5180] (that
      is, it MUST support all "MUST" requirements in such documents, and
      may also support the "SHOULD" requirements in such documents).

         NOTE: This is for operators to spot be able to identify cases
         where a devices may under-perform in the presence of IPv6
         traffic (see e.g. [FW-Benchmark]).  XXX: This note may be
         removed before publication if deemed appropriate.

   REQ GEN-10:
      All features of the firewall MUST be able to be individually
      configured (at least ON or OFF, with other configurable parameters
      as applicable).  A well-documented default initial setting must be
      provided for each feature.

   REQ GEN-20:
      MUST support basic Access Control Lists (ACLs).

   REQ GEN-30:
      MUST support stateless packet inspection and filtering at
      transport layer.

   REQ GEN-40:



Gont, et al.            Expires October 18, 2014                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Firewalls                   April 2014


      MUST support stateful packet inspection and filtering at transport
      layer.

   REQ GEN-50:
      SHOULD support full-proxy for the TCP [RFC0793] connections (the
      handshake is validated on the firewall before reaching the target
      system).

         Some products identify this feature with terms such as "TCP
         Intercept and Limiting Embryonic Connections".

   REQ GEN-60:
      MUST be able to enforce timeouts on protocol sessions based on the
      upper-layer protocol (e.g. enforce a timeout on the FIN-WAIT state
      for TCP connections, a timeout for DNS query/respose pair, etc.).
      In general, it MUST have different timeout parameters and
      thresholds to be used to prevent idle sessions from exhausting
      resources on the device and/or the service that is defended.  For
      sessions composed of multiple packets (such as TCP connections),
      the exchange of valid packets MUST refresh the timers employed for
      enforcing the aforementioned timeouts.

         NOTE: This is to avoid the known and buggy behavior where
         firewalls enforce a maximum lifetime for the protocol session
         (e.g. TCP connection) regardless of whether there is ongoing
         exchange of legitimate packets for such session.

   REQ GEN-70:
      MUST be able to provide anti-spoofing features (e.g. uRPF ).

   REQ GEN-80:
      MUST be able to redirect specific traffic to a proxy server e.g.
      for HTTP/S protocols.

         NOTE: "Redirection means that the firewall should be able to
         divert the traffic to a proxy - i.e., take the traffic, send it
         to an inspection engine, receive it back and forward it (all
         this completely transparent to the users).

   REQ GEN-90:
      MUST be able to detect and reject invalid source or destination
      addresses (e.g. local-link addresses that try to traverse the
      firewall) with a single policy.

      filtering configuration.

   REQ SPC-20:
      MUST be able to block packets containing any specified extension
      header type (based on its Next Header value), on a specified
      number of instances of a specified extension header type, and on a
      specified overall number of IPv6 extension headers.

   REQ SPC-30:
      MUST be able to block IPv6 packets that employ a Routing Header
      both at the granularity of Extension Header Type (as required in
      SPC-20) and Routing Header Type.

   REQ SPC-40:
      SHOULD be able to drop packets based on IPv6 option types.

   REQ SPC-50:
      MUST be able to detect IPv6 tunnels such as SIIT [RFC6145], 6to4
      [RFC3056], 6in4 [RFC4213], ISATAP [RFC5214] and Teredo [RFC4380]
      (please see [RFC7123], and MUST be able to selectively block or
      allow them for specific sources, destinations, routes or
      interfaces.

   REQ SPC-60:
      MUST be able to validate IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] packets
      (RS, RA, NS, NA, Redirect) according to
      [I-D.ietf-opsec-ipv6-nd-security].

   REQ SPC-70:
      MUST be able to statefully match ICMPv6 errors to TCP [RFC0793],
      UDP [RFC0768], and ICMPv6 [RFC4443] communication instances (see
      [RFC5927]).

   REQ SPC-80:
      MUST be able to parse all defined extension headers according to
      [RFC7045], and SHOULD filter packets containing IPv6 Extension
      Headers as recommended in [draft-gont-opsec-ipv6-eh-filtering].

   REQ SPC-90:
      MUST be able to find the upper-layer protocol in an IPv6 header
      chain (see [RFC7112].

   REQ SPC-100:

      on the device, the same inspection policies that are possible in
      the non tunnelled traffic.

   REQ VPN-90:
      MUST perform a full validation of the certificates' chains when
      verifying the validity of the OCSP/CLR responses.  Caching of
      responses SHOULD be configurable by end users, and the default
      response SHOULD be not to accept a non-valid certificate.  The
      default response MAY be overridden by the administrators, but it
      MUST be configurable on a per-domain basis (e.g. accept incomplete

      MUST be able to provide bandwidth management (QoS or anti-
      flooding) policies customizable for specific source and
      destination networks, or by VLAN or MPLS ID.

      MUST be able to participate to a blackhole/synkhole routing
      infrastructure as per [RFC5635].

   REQ DoS-85:
      MUST be able to fetch and use third party "reputational" IP white-
      and black-lists (e.g. download them via RSS feeds or query via
      them DNS record) and use them in policy constructs/ACLs.  In
      general, it MUST be able to provide some form of reputational
      service for IP addresses which must include IPv6 networks.

      are the following:

      1.   allow the traffic ("ignore" or "whitelist")

      2.   allow the traffic but log ("bypass" or "detection only" mode)

      3.   drop the packet (only the offending packet but do not reset
           the connection)

      4.   drop session (drop the entire connection, but do not send a
           reset back)

      5.   "greylist" - put it in a list of blocked addresses, but
           remove it from the list after a configurable amount of time

      6.   send an email/SMS/pager text to the firewall administrator

      7.   send TCP reset to source only

      8.   send TCP reset to destination only

      9.   send TCP reset to both source and destination

      10.  perform a specific, preconfigured change on the firewall
           policy

      11.  feed a third party source such as a switch/NAC/NAP or RADIUS
           system, to isolate/quarantine the offending port/MAC address/
           user

      12.  quarantine the specific traffic or source (block them for a
           configurable amount of time, e.g. 5 minutes, and then allow
           them again; eventually, the quarantine time may get longer if
           the offense is repeated)

8.  Application Layer Firewall

   REQ APP-10:
      MUST be able to provide web filtering features, such as enforcing
      access to allowed web content and filtering high risk URLs such as
      anonymizers and known hostile addresses.

   REQ APP-20:
      MUST be able to provide email filtering features, such as
      mitigating spam, phishing and email harvesting, and enforce email
      policies.

9.  Logging, Auditing and Security Operation Centre (SOC) requirements

   REQ SOC-10:
      MUST generate log for all the changes performed to the system,
      including change of group membership for a device, new or removed
      devices in a group, new or removed administrators.

   REQ SOC-20:
      MUST provide the following features:

      1.  Connection logs

      2.  Local log storage

      3.  Network logging

      4.  Real time log viewer

      5.  Attack detected

      6.  Per rule logging

      7.  Automatic log file compression

      8.  Log file rotation

   REQ SOC-30:
      MUST be able to generate a log for:

      1.  all the logins, logouts and failed login attempts from
          firewall administrators

      2.  any modifications or disabling of the firewall rules

   REQ SOC-40:
      Any security event detected - malicious traffic, hit of a policy,
      policy violation, termination of a session and so on - MUST be
      able to generate a log, and be configurable to do that or not by
      administrators.

   REQ SOC-50:
      There MUST be a mechanism to prevent log flooding from the device
      against the management system, such as aggregation of like events.

   REQ SOC-60:
      The amount of information in the alerts MUST be configurable; it
      SHOULD possible to have the date/time and type of event and the
      full payload of the traffic that has triggered the signature/
      event.

   REQ SOC-70:
      The firewall MUST minimize the number of log entries generated for
      a single event - e.g. when repeated similar events for a short
      period of time are detected, they are aggregated and the
      cumulative number of events is reported.

   REQ SOC-80:
      The firewall MUST be able to send logs in multiple ways and
      formats, for instance UDP syslog, TCP syslog, SMTP, SNMP and so
      on.  It must be possible to configure different ways and formats
      for different policies and configure some ways and formats as a
      "backup" in the case that the main way fails.  Please describe the
      different possibilities.

   REQ SOC-90:
      The firewall SHOULD alert the firewall administrator when the
      policy to be enforced does not follow the advice in [RFC4890] --
      particularly if the filtering policy would block/drop ICMPv6
      Packet Too Big error messages.

10.  Console and Events Visualization requirements

   REQ CON-10:
      MUST provide a dashboard view, which must be customizable by end-
      user and end-users' group (e.g. their Microsoft Active Directory
      or LDAP group).

   REQ CON-20:
      The dashboard must be able to include system health monitoring
      information, such as the following:

      1.  CPU idle

      2.  Real and Swap memory usage

      3.  Disk usage

      4.  Number of accepted and dropped packets

      5.  Operating status for all supported facilities (HA, QoS, VPN)

      6.  VPN tunnels status

      7.  NIC link state

   REQ CON-30:
      MUST have the possibility to select a particular piece of data or
      individual alert, and visualize the policy that has triggered the
      event.

   REQ CON-40:
      MUST be able to create exception filters that will suppress
      visualization of a specific alert (e.g. from specific sources, or
      specific events), without actually affecting the detection and log
      retention.

   REQ CON-50:
      MUST provide a remote access method to obtain all current
      operational data on demand, in a documented format, covering items
      such as those listed in REQ CON-20.

         Note: This is to be able to integrate firewall operations in an
         existing NMS.

11.  Reporting requirements

   REQ REP-10:
      Built in reports MUST be provided by default, such as protocol
      distribution, policy and rule matched, top attacks, top sources/
      destinations, top targets, top geographical sources, device status
      including utilizations, and so on.

   REQ REP-20:
      SHOULD allow to run reporting over historical and archived logs,
      automatically restoring and re-archiving them.
