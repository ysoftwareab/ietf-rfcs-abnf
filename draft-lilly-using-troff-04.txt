Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

1. Introduction

   The Instructions to RFC Authors RFC [N1.RFC2223] describes the
   editorial format of RFCs and outlines editorial production of
   Internet-Drafts and RFCs using basic troff directives [I1.CSTR54]
   with the ms macro package [I2.ms] and a postprocessor which is
   necessitated by use of the ms macro package.  However, use of basic
   directives and the ms macro package is not ideal.

1.1. Basic Directives Are at Too Low a Level

   Use of basic troff directives is not ideal for authors or editors who
   are not familiar with troff arcana.  On the one hand, the example in
   [N1.RFC2223] uses a larger variety of troff directives than some
   casual users might be familiar with.  On the other hand, instead of
   using directives such as .tl to produce first page headings, it
   suggests that authors or editors should count characters to manually
   justify the first page heading.

1.2. Authors Specify Content Rather Than Issue Directives

   Another problem with low-level directives is that authors are not
   primarily concerned with formatting details.  An author needs to
   indicate things like "this is the document title" or "a new section
   starts here".  Authors rarely think in low-level formatting terms
   such as are provided by basic troff directives, e.g. "center the next
   3 lines".

1.3. ms Macros Are Not Designed For RFCs

   Macros provide a mechanism for authors to specify type of content
   rather than formatting details.  However, use of the ms macro package
   is not ideal for production of RFCs and Internet-Drafts as that macro
   package was not designed for the specific document format described
   in [N1.RFC2223].  Use of some high-level ms macros results in text
   which violates some provisions of the [N1.RFC2223] format, while
   other ms macros are unusable due to differences between RFC document
   format and the types of documents that the ms package was designed to
   produce.  There are also implementation differences in different
   versions of "ms" macro packages.  Finally, it is the ms macro package
   which has stymied the RFC Editor's attempts to get a form feed
   character at the end of each page [N1.RFC2223], [I3.RFC1543].

1.4. RFC-specific Macros

   This memo describes use of a macro package which is designed
   specifically for production of RFCs and Internet-Drafts, which
   provides a high-level abstraction to insulate authors and editors
   from many troff details and frees authors and editors from tedium
   such as counting characters.

2. Requirement Levels

   The key words "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "RECOMMENDED" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [N2.BCP14].

3. Processing

   Production of a document using troff and a macro package proceeds in
   several stages:

   1. A mixture of free-form text, processing directives, and material
      describing non-textual content (tables, diagrams, etc.) is
      generated by the author.

   2. Preprocessors [I4.CSTR49], [I5.CSTR114], [I6.CSTR116],
      [I7.CSTR122], [I8.eqn], [I9.CSTR142] may be used to transform
      descriptions of tables, diagrams, etc.

   3. A formatter transforms instructions and other input into a
      formatted document according to rules corresponding to the desired
      document format.

   4. Some postprocessing may take place to repaginate output and to
      make final adjustments to the output format.

   Tools, e.g. [I10.make], are available to automate the preprocessor,
   formatter, and postprocessing portions of document processing,
   freeing the author to concentrate on the document content.

4. Input Format

   Input consists of text to be formatted, directives that specify
   formatting parameters and actions, and special sequences that provide
   access to saved strings and numbers.  Directives consist of a line
   beginning with a period (also known as "dot").  The dot may be
   followed by space characters, and then a named directive.  The name
   consists of one or more printing characters.  Many directives also
   take arguments, which are space-separated strings of characters.
   Unless directed otherwise, input is collected and formed into
   paragraphs without regard to line breaks in the input.  Input text
   consisting of the lines:

.IP
All bad precedents
begin with
justifiable measures. \" Julius Caesar
.\" This is a comment.
A strong conviction
that something must be done
is the parent of
many bad measures. \" Daniel Webster
Any excuse
will serve
a tyrant. \" Aesop

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

   is formatted into an indented paragraph which looks like:

   All bad precedents begin with justifiable measures.  A strong
   conviction that something must be done is the parent of many bad
   measures.  Any excuse will serve a tyrant.

   The character sequence \" introduces a comment which continues to the
   end of the line.  If an entire line is a comment, starting the line
   with a dot followed by the comment ensures that extra space does not
   appear in the output.  Authors should be careful about use of the
   backslash, which is an escape character that introduces special
   sequences.  If it is necessary to have a backslash appear in the
   formatted output, the sequence \e, i.e. a backslash followed by a
   lower-case letter e, will produce it.  Unescaped backslashes followed
   by double quotes have been known to cause important text to vanish
   from published RFCs.

5. Specifics

5.1. Loading the RFC Macros

   The first directive might be the line:

.so tmac.rfc

   That directs the processor to read the contents of a file named
   "tmac.rfc", which contains the macros that describe the RFC format,
   holds boilerplate text, and provides convenience functions.

   Alternate methods of using the macros might be available:

   1. the file tmac.rfc can be specified on the command line before the
      file with source content

   2. the rfc macros may have been locally installed in a manner that
      permits use of a command-line -mrfc argument.

5.2. Specifying the Document Particulars

   Each RFC or Internet-Draft has a title, one or more authors, etc.
   These are specified with directives.

5.2.1. Titles, Long and Short

   The TL directive, as in

.TL "Writing Internet\-Drafts and Requests For Comments using troff and\
\& nroff

   specifies the document title.  The double-quote causes the remainder
   of the (logical) line to be taken as a single argument to the TL
   macro; otherwise each space character would be taken as an argument
   separator.  Note also that a backslash character appears before the
   hyphen; that causes the hyphen to be interpreted as a normal text

Lilly                   Expires November 6, 2005                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

   hyphen rather than as an indication of a possible hyphenation
   (line-breaking) point.  The backslash at the end of the first line
   escapes the end-of-line, allowing the line to effectively continue
   with the contents of the second line.  Escape sequences are discussed
   in detail in [I1.CSTR54].  There is a short title (ST) macro which is
   used to specify a short version of the document title for use in page
   headings.  For this document, that was specified as:

.ST "Writing I\-Ds and RFCs using troff

5.2.2. RFC or Draft Version Number

   RFCs have an RFC number assigned by the RFC Editor; Internet-Drafts
   have a version number.  The number is specified with the NU macro or
   by setting a register with a command-line argument as described in
   Appendix A: a negative number is interpreted as an incremental
   version number for a draft; -1 for draft version -00, -2 for draft
   version -01, etc.  A positive number is interpreted as an RFC number
   and SHOULD only be assigned by the RFC Editor.  A zero value is
   treated like an RFC, but prints XXXX where an RFC number would
   appear.

5.2.3. Document Category (RFCs)

   RFCs have a category; one of Experimental, Informational, Standards
   Track, or Best Current Practice [I11.BCP9].  The category is
   specified as the argument to the CA macro; that macro directive need
   only be supplied for RFCs (if supplied in drafts it shows as Intended
   status in the first page heading) [N3.ID].

5.2.4. Updated and Obsoleted RFCs

   Some RFCs update or obsolete earlier RFCs.  If an RFC is updated by
   the document, the number of the updated RFC should be specified as
   the argument to an UP macro.  Similarly, an obsoleted RFC is
   indicated by an argument to an OB macro.  Multiple UP and OB macros
   may be used to indicate that multiple RFCs are updated or obsoleted.

5.2.5. Internet-Draft File Name

   An Internet-Draft has a file name used for retrieval; the base file
   name (without the trailing hyphen and version number suffix) is
   specified as the argument to the FN macro; the FN macro is not
   necessary (is ignored) for RFCs.  The file name may contain only
   lower-case letters, digits, and hyphens [N3.ID].

5.2.6. Authors or Editors

   An Internet-Draft or RFC may have up to five authors specified.
   Information for each author may be specified via the AU macro.  The
   macro takes 9 arguments:

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

   Argument                          Description
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
      1       First initial and surname for first page heading
      2       First name and/or initials for Author's Address section
      3       Surname for page footer and Author's Address section
      4       Gender; one of m (male), f (female), or o (other or
              indeterminate)
      5       Internet mailbox
      6       Telephone Number
      7       Fax Number
      8       URL
      9       Affiliation

   The author's gender is used to customize boilerplate verbiage to
   accommodate enforcers of political correctness, at least until
   individual male or female authors are prohibited from submitting
   Internet-Drafts with sensible boilerplate.  Arguments containing
   space characters must be enclosed in double quotes.  Arguments that
   are not used must have an empty double quoted string or other
   zero-width argument as a placeholder.  Optional text following the AU
   macro line is collected verbatim (without flowing into a paragraph)
   as the postal address for the author.  Similar information can be
   provided for additional authors by additional AU macro calls.

   Some documents, notably those produced by IETF Working Groups, are
   prepared by a Document Editor [I12.BCP25].  To distinguish an Editor
   from an Author, use the ED macro instead of the AU macro.  There may
   be multiple Editors, but one cannot have a mix of Authors and Editors
   (if one is specified as an Editor, all are treated as Editors).

5.2.7. Date

   The date used for the document heading is normally the current date
   when formatted.  It can be explicitly specified via the DT macro
   which takes three numeric arguments (4-digit year, month, and day
   respectively), or the values may be specified via command-line
   arguments as described in Appendix A.

5.2.8. Section Headings and the Table of Contents

   An RFC or Internet-Draft may contain numbered sections.  Sections may
   have subsections, and the section level represents the number of
   dot-separated levels.  This section of this document has level 3.  A
   long document benefits from a Table of Contents.  As sections are
   specified, the rfc macro package collects information for a Table of
   Contents.  The TC macro takes two arguments.  The first specifies the
   number of pages to reserve for the Table of Contents (zero to omit
   the table), and the second argument specifies the maximum section
   level to include in the Table of Contents entries.

   These parameters may alternatively be specified via command-line
   arguments.  See Appendix A for details.

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

5.2.9. Independent vs. IETF Submissions

   Internet-Drafts and RFCs may be products of IETF Working Groups or
   other IETF entities, or they may be independent submissions.  The
   macro IS is used to identify independent submissions, as there is a
   slight difference in the boilerplate text which accompanies them.
   The IS macro takes no arguments.

   Unfortunately, the IETF Secretariat rejects independent
   Internet-Draft submissions that have the independent submission
   boilerplate required by the RFC Editor [I13.Instruct] (bottom of page
   33), probably because it is not recognized by Henrik Levkowetz'
   "idnits" program [I14.idnits].  Therefore, until the IETF Secretariat
   and the RFC Editor resolve their differences the IS macro SHOULD NOT
   be used except by the RFC Editor.

5.2.10. Optional Notices

   Certain optional notices may be placed at the front of
   Internet-Drafts.  The ON macro is used to specify one of the
   following notices via a numeric argument:

   Type                               Text
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    1     This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it
          may not be created.  This document may only be posted in an
          Internet-Draft.
    2     This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it
          may not be created, except to publish it as an RFC and to
          translate it into languages other than English.

   If a second argument is given to the ON macro, it is interpreted as
   the number of a section that may be extracted.  The text is modified
   to reflect that.  For example:

.ON 1 1.2.3

   produces the text:

   This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may not
   be created other than to extract section 1.2.3 as-is for separate
   use.  This document may only be posted in an Internet-Draft.

5.3. Document Content

   Having specified preliminary information as described above, the
   document content may be specified.


5.3.1. Abstract

   The first item that an author might want to provide is the Abstract
   for the document.  It is initiated with the AB macro, which takes no
   arguments.  It collects text until the next macro directive into a

Lilly                   Expires November 6, 2005                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

   paragraph for the document abstract.  An abstract is required for an
   Internet-Draft; it is optional for an RFC.

5.3.2. Numbered and Unnumbered Sections

   Additional document content is usually organized into sections.
   There are two types of sections: numbered and unnumbered.  For the
   purpose of collecting headings for the Table of Contents, unnumbered
   sections have a section "level" even though no number appears.  A
   section is initiated with an SH macro for unnumbered sections, or an
   NH macro for numbered sections.  Each macro takes two arguments: the
   section level and the section heading text.  Numbering for numbered
   sections is computed automatically.

5.3.3. Paragraphs

   Within sections, text is organized into paragraphs.  RFCs and
   Internet-Drafts usually use indented block paragraphs like this one;
   these are introduced with the IP macro.  That macro can take two
   optional arguments: initial unindented text and an indent distance.
   The defaults are no unindented text and an indent distance of 3
   character spaces (0.3 inch).  Various units may be used in troff; it
   is strongly RECOMMENDED that horizontal distances, such as the indent
   distance, be specified in multiples of 0.1 inch so that nroff- and
   troff-formatted versions of documents maintain the same line and page
   breaks.

   Unindented paragraphs are possible via the LP macro.

5.3.4. Special Indentation

   Indentation may be controlled with RS and RE macros.  The RS macro
   will increase the indent level by the paragraph indentation increment
   of 3 character spaces, while the RE macro will reduce indentation by
   that amount.

5.3.5. Reserving Vertical Space

   Sometimes it is necessary to ensure that there is sufficient vertical
   space before the bottom of the current page for some complex output
   that cannot easily be handled with a keep or display (see below).
   The NS macro takes one argument specifying the number of text lines
   needed.  If fewer lines remain on the current page, output will
   continue at the top of the next page.

5.3.6. Keeps and Displays

   Sometimes one has lines of text or non-textual content which one
   would like to appear as a group, uninterrupted by page breaks.  Such
   a group is called a "keep" and is specified by preceding the group
   with the KS macro and following it with a KE macro.  Keeps are
   typically used to fine-tune formatting; they are rarely required.



Lilly                   Expires November 6, 2005                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

   Keeps will not work with multiple paragraphs (or list items) between
   KS and KE directives.  To force a page break if there is less than a
   certain amount of vertical space remaining on the current page, use
   the NS macro directive to reserve space.

   More complex groupings can be obtained by "displays".  Displays are
   started like keeps, using the DS macro.  Display content is not
   filled into paragraphs; output appears like the input lines except
   for indentation.  The DS macro takes an argument consisting of a
   single letter which identifies the type of display:

   Type                           Description
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    C   Each line of text is centered
    B   The input lines are read as a block, and the block is centered
    L   The display is left-aligned
    I   The display is indented by the amount indicated by an optional
        second argument (default is 3 character spaces)

   Displays are typically used for block quoted material and for
   preventing page breaks within non-textual material such as tables and
   diagrams.  For example, the input:

.DS C
War is Peace
Freedom is Slavery
Ignorance is Strength
.\" Eric Arthur Blair, a.k.a. George Orwell
.DE

   produces output in which each line is centered:

                              War is Peace
                           Freedom is Slavery
                         Ignorance is Strength

   whereas the input:

.DS B
War can still settle problems,
but it can only settle them the wrong way. \" Bertrand Russell
.DE

   produces the text lines as a centered block:

               War can still settle problems,
               but it can only settle them the wrong way.

   Sometimes placement of a display, such as one containing a diagram,
   is not critical.  A floating display allows text and non-floating
   displays which follow it in the source document to be output before
   it if it will not fit on the current output page.  A floating display
   begins with a DF macro call, taking the same arguments as DS and
   ending with a DE macro call.  Floating displays are output before the

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

   end of the section and subsection in which they are defined in the
   input, so they cannot appear in the wrong section of the formatted
   document.

   Text following a display or keep should be organized as a paragraph,
   to ensure that the text appears where expected on output and so that
   page breaks can be adjusted to prevent widows and orphans.

5.3.7. Lists

5.3.7.1. Numbered Lists

   The NL macro initializes a numbered list.  It takes three optional
   arguments:

   1. a prefix string.  The default is an empty string (no prefix).

   2. a one-character numbering format; one of

      1  number using Arabic numerals (the default)

      I  number using Roman numbers expressed as upper-case letters

      i  number using Roman numbers expressed as lower-case letters

      A  letter with upper-case letters

      a  letter with lower-case letters

   3. a suffix string.  The default is a period.

   Each list item after the initialization is introduced by the LI (list
   item) macro.  Text following the LI macro line is processed as an
   indented paragraph with the first line numbered.

   The most recently started list is terminated with the LE (list end)
   macro.

   Lists may be nested up to 9 levels deep.  Each level of nesting is
   indented by the paragraph indent value (3 characters).  The list
   above has a variable list (see description below) inside a numbered
   list.

5.3.7.2. Bulleted Lists

   A bulleted list is initialized with the BL macro.  List items also
   use the LI macro and the LE macro ends a bulleted list.

   The input lines:

.LI

bulleted item
.LE

   produce the output:

   o  first bulleted item

   o  second bulleted item

   The BL macro will accept an optional argument, which is treated as a
   string to use in place of the default bullet character.

5.3.7.3. Variable Lists

   The VL macro initializes a variable list.  Each list item is labeled
   with a string supplied as an argument on that item's LI macro line.
   The LE macro terminates a variable list.

5.3.8. References

   Internet-Drafts and RFCs contain two types of references: normative
   references and informative references.  Citations for the reference
   material appear near the end of the document and are indicated by a
   bracketed tag within the document text like this: [N1.RFC2223].
   Macros are provided to automatically number and format normative and
   informative references in the style used in this document.  The
   reference tags consist of the letter N (for normative references) or
   I (for informative references), followed by a sequential number
   within each series, optionally followed by a dot and a string
   supplied as an argument to the NR macro for normative references, IR
   for informative references.  A second argument may be supplied to
   save the generated reference tag in a named string; the second
   argument must be 2 characters suitable as the name of a string.
   Internal string names used by the rfc macro package always begin with
   an upper-case letter; it is generally safe to use a two-character
   name that begins with a lower-case letter which is followed by an
   upper-case letter or a digit (troff internally has some strings which
   are named with two lower-case letters).  The first normative
   reference in this document could have been specified by the lines:

.NR RFC2223 r1
Postel, J. and J. Reynolds, "Instructions to RFC Authors", RFC\ 2223,
October 1997.
.NE

   For references to RFCs, one can simply copy and paste the text made
   available by the RFC Editor in the file rfc-ref.txt, as has been done
   in this example (the actual reference text was on a single input
   line, though that is not required, and the backslash preceding the

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

   space after "RFC" prevents lines being broken at that space, i.e.
   within the RFC document number).  The reference text follows the NR
   or IR macro line and will be suitably formatted and placed in the
   Normative References or Informative References section of the
   generated document.  The reference text is ended with an NE or IE
   macro.

   The bracketed reference string appears in the text at the place where
   the NR/NE or IR/IE macros are placed, while the actual reference
   citation text is saved for output in unnumbered Normative References
   and Informative References sections.  No space appears after the
   bracketed reference, so a list of such references may appear with
   comma separators by simply placing a line containing a comma between
   reference macro groups.  If a bracketed reference appears at the end
   of a sentence, the period marking the end of the sentence must be
   provided in the input after the NE or IE macro line.  However, a line
   beginning with a dot is normally interpreted as a directive; to
   prevent that, the line should begin with the two character sequence
   \& preceding the period.  That sequence represents a zero-width
   non-printing space which prevents interpretation of the line as a
   directive without affecting the appearance of the output.

   The reference tag (including the brackets) generated by the example
   above is saved in the troff string named r1, which can be used to
   refer to the same reference.  That reference tag can be made to
   subsequently appear in the document text via a reference to the saved
   troff string, viz. the character sequence \*(r1.

   References to RFCs by number or via numeric reference to the
   corresponding BCP, STD, or FYI series number can be generated by
   using the rfcref preprocessor.  That preprocessor takes input like:

.RR N 2223 r1

   and generates the corresponding reference text and NR/NE or IR/IE
   macro directives.  That involves a little less manual work for
   authors; there is no need to copy reference citation text and there
   is no end-of-reference directive.

   Four preprocessor directives are recognized:

   Directive   Document Series
   ----------------------------
      BR             BCP
      FR             FYI
      SR             STD
      RR             RFC

   Each directive takes two or three arguments:

   1. a single letter, I or N, to indicate an informative or normative
      reference, respectively

   2. the document series number

Lilly                   Expires November 6, 2005               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

   3. (optional) a string name for saving the reference tag

   Note that some STD documents map to multiple RFC numbers, and that
   some STD document series numbers are either reserved for future use
   or are no longer in use.

   The rfcref preprocessor also checks whether documents have been
   updated or obsoleted, and issues suitable warnings.

5.3.9. MIB modules, etc.

   When a MIB module or similar entity is defined and there is a
   limitation notice (via the ON macro), there may need to be a separate
   copyright notice placed in the part to be extracted per [N4.BCP78].
   The IB macro may be called at the appropriate section to generate the
   properly-formatted boilerplate text.  The mandatory first argument to
   the IB macro selects the type of statement from the ones permitted by
   [N4.BCP78], and the optional second argument permits specifying
   something other than "MIB module".  An optional third argument may be
   used to specify a prefix to the statement, an optional fourth
   argument may be used to specify an indent other than paragraph
   indent, and an optional fifth argument may be used for a suffix.
   Unused arguments may be specified as empty strings or other
   zero-width items.  The types are:

   Type                               Text
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    1     Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2005).  This version of
          this MIB module is part of RFC XXXX; see the RFC itself for
          full legal notices.
    2     Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2005).  The initial
          version of this MIB module was published in RFC XXXX; for
          full legal notices see the RFC itself.  Supplementary
          information may be available on
          http://www.ietf.org/copyrights/ianamib.html.

   The correct year is used, and when an RFC number is assigned by the
   RFC Editor, the RFC number will appear in place of XXXX.  As noted
   above, alternate text may be substituted for "MIB module".

5.3.10. Document Appendices

   Appendices appear like numbered sections, except that the first-level
   consists of upper-case letters rather than numbers.  Each appendix to
   appear in the document should be introduced with the AP macro, which
   causes such numbering to take place.  The AP macro takes a single
   argument, the appendix heading text.  Subdivided sections within an
   appendix can be introduced with second-, third-level, etc. numbering
   via NH macros as with document body sections.

5.4. End Matter

   At the very end of the input file describing the document, the author
   should place an EM macro directive.  That causes output of

   references, author's address (or authors' addresses), and IPR
   boilerplate sections.  If a TC macro was provided at the beginning of
   the document input with a non-zero first argument, or if the document
   is more than 15 pages in length, a Table of Contents is also
   produced.

Appendix A. Esoterica

A.1. Troff vs. Nroff

   RFCs and Internet-Drafts are produced as text documents.  It is
   sometimes desirable to produce a formatted version for improved
   rendition of diagrams, etc.  The rfc macro package has been designed
   so that troff formatted output resembles the text version as closely
   as possible; it utilizes a monospaced font for text, does not
   embolden section headings (unlike the ms macro package), and centers
   each page within 8.5 by 11 inch page boundaries.  Other than improved
   appearance of non-textual matter, troff and nroff versions of
   documents produced with the rfc macro package should appear nearly
   identical after postprocessing, including page and line breaks.  One
   subtlety is that centered text with an odd number of characters is
   offset left or right in nroff output, whereas it is truly centered in
   troff output.  Output processed with nroff for text production
   includes a form feed character after each page (the "fix.pl" script
   specified in [N1.RFC2223] is not necessary).

   Separate processing can be performed by troff and nroff by using
   nroff/troff conditionals, e.g.:

.ie t \{ \
<troff input goes here>
.\}
.el \{ \
<nroff input goes here>
.\}

   For a more complete example, consider:

















              (see PostScript or PDF versions for diagram)


















   Diagrams imported from some sources which generate pic may require a
   reset, and in some cases setting of pic variables such as maxpsht and
   maxpswid.

   To conform page breaks between troff- and nroff-generated documents,
   the height of troff- and nroff-produced output should be the same.
   In the example above, that is implemented with an invisible pic box
   in the nroff-processed version which contains the text referring to
   the troff-formatted versions.


Lilly                   Expires November 6, 2005               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

   Some implementations fake text formatting with "troff -a" or
   "troff -N" rather than a true nroff.  That generally works poorly,
   particularly if tables, diagrams, etc. are included in the document.

   Some troff implementations can produce PostScript directly; others
   require a separate postprocessor.  PostScript produced by some troff
   implementations is not amenable to postprocessing to repaginate
   (relocate the table of contents).

A.2. Output Adjustments

   Formatting may be adjusted by setting registers using command-line
   arguments [I1.CSTR54].  Register names and default values are:

   Name   Default Value   Function
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
    C     0 (zero)        Table of Contents length (pages)
    D     Current day     Day of month used as publication date.
          of month        Overridden by DT macro.
    H     2               Highest section heading level to include in
                          Table of Contents
    I     0.3i            Paragraph indent increment.  Each character
                          is 0.1i wide.
    L     7.2i            Text line length.  Each character is 0.1i
                          wide.  The default value provides 72
                          characters per line and may not be exceeded.
    M     Current month   Month number (January = 1) used as
                          publication date.  Overridden by DT macro.
    N     0 (zero)        RFC or Draft version number (negative for
                          drafts).  Overrides NU macro if non-zero.
    O     2               Minimum number of continued running text
                          lines at bottom of page (anything less is
                          considered an orphan).
    P     12              Text point size (troff).
    Q     58              Printed lines per page.  The default value
                          is the maximum permitted.
    R     for centered    Page offset for odd-numbered (recto) pages.
          text (troff)    Always zero for nroff (text output).
    S     1P              Interparagraph vertical space.  The default
                          is equivalent to one text line.  For
                          nroff/troff consistency, the value should be
                          an integral multiple of 1P.
    T     for centered    Top margin.  Always zero for nroff (text
          text (troff)    output).
    V     for centered    Page offset for even-numbered (verso) pages.
          text (troff)    Always zero for nroff (text output).
    W     2               Minimum number of continued running text
                          lines at top of page (anything less is
                          considered a widow).
    X     8.5i            Physical page width (troff).
    Y     Current year    4-digit year number used as publication
                          date.  Overridden by DT macro.
    Z     11i             Physical page height (troff).

A.2.1. Formatting for Specific Paper Sizes

   By default, output processed by troff (as distinct from text output
   produced by nroff) is formatted for economical ANSI standard A
   (8.5 x 11 inches) [I16.ANSI151] paper, with the printed content
   centered on each page.  Output may instead be formatted for other
   paper sizes by setting troff registers listed above (as these all
   have one-letter names, they can be set by command-line arguments;
   they SHOULD NOT be set in the source file as that would adversely
   affect output produced from that source file, e.g. by the RFC
   Editor).  For example, to produce output formatted for ISO
   [I17.ISO216] A4 paper, with a 20mm margin for hole punches for ring
   binder filing, registers X, Z, R, and V would be set with
   command-line arguments -rX21c -rZ29.7c -rR2c -rV0.712c.

A.3. Tips and Tricks

   Handling non-textual material is simplified by using preprocessors.
   However, there are some subtleties that can cause frustration for
   authors.  Some tips regarding preprocessors and a few tricks to
   ensure satisfactory formatting follow.

A.3.1. Mathematics and Chemistry

   While eqn [I8.eqn] is capable of setting complex equations, many
   symbols cannot be adequately represented in plain text.  so, while

                              x=f(y/2)+y/2

   can be approximated, complex mathematics cannot be represented well
   in plain text.  Subscripts and superscripts pose problems, and for
   that reason chemical formulae cannot be represented well except for
   trivial cases.  Chem [I7.CSTR122] also tends to emit excess vertical
   space before a formula not containing a carbon ring and tends to
   screw up subsequent diagrams unless at least the first diagram after
   a chemical formula contains a pic "reset" directive.  That can be
   accomplished with an otherwise empty pic diagram.

A.3.2. Data Formats

   The DFORMAT program [I9.CSTR142] produces output suitable for
   processing by pic [I6.CSTR116] to generate data format layouts.  For
   example:

    0---------------------------------------------2324------------31+

   Note that dimensions are specified to dformat in inches, and in the
   example suitable dimensions were chosen to match text format
   character width (multiples of 0.1 inch) and line height (1/6 inch) so
   that text and troff-formatted versions are reasonably consistent.
   The \0 sequences are invisible character-width spaces which improve
   the text (nroff) output.

   Graphs and charts may be generated from data using the grap

   Grap produces output in pic input format; it is subsequently
   processed by pic to generate a graphical representation.  There are
   multiple implementations of both grap and pic, and there is also some
   interaction between pic-produced output and formatters.  In
   particular, some implementations of grap produce pic with dimensions
   unsuitable for generating plain text in Internet-Draft/RFC format.
   Authors who include graphs should be aware of these issues; they can
   be safely ignored if no graphs are included.

   For consistency, the output produced by grap and pic should be
   examined to confirm that the height is specified as a multiple of 1/6
   inch and the width is a multiple of 0.1 inch, not exceeding 7.2
   inches.  Placement of labels should also be checked between text
   (nroff) and PostScript (troff) versions, and adjustments to the
   source graph specification made as required.

A.3.4. Simple Diagrams

   Pic [I6.CSTR116] can produce simple diagrams.  Text output
   approximation is limited to rectilinear lines, so one should avoid
   ellipses, splines, etc.  Box, line, etc. dimensions should be
   multiples of character width (0.1 inch) and text line height (1/6
   inch) for consistency between text and troff-formatted documents.
   For example:

.DS B
.PS
boxwid = 0.8
# arrow approximation that looks acceptable in troff and nroff
define myarrow X A: [ move right 0.055;\
 "<" ljust;line right ($1 - 0.1);">" rjust;\
 move right 0.045 ]\
X

   The diagram looks like this:

                SMTP client                  SMTP server

   Some versions of pic are able to approximate arrows well; others are
   not.  The example above emulates arrows with a mix of lines and text
   characters to work around poor approximations of pic arrows.  Some
   implementations of pic generate output for multi-line text labels
   which does not work well with some implementations of nroff.  Authors
   who include graphs and diagrams should be aware of these issues; they
   can be safely ignored if no graphs or diagrams are included.

A.3.5. Tables

   Tables may be formatted using the tbl program [I4.CSTR49].
   Horizontal rules produced in troff-formatted documents take less
   vertical space than those formatted by nroff, throwing off page
   breaks unless special precautions are taken.  Consistent vertical
   space may be forced by using the following sequence of lines to
   produce full-width horizontal rules:

.mk vP
.if t .sp 0.33P
_
.if t .sp |\n(vPu+1P

   Those lines perform the following steps to ensure consistency:

   1. Mark the current vertical place in register vP.

   2. For troff (but not nroff), move down approximately one-third of a
      text line.  This approximately centers the horizontal rule in the
      vertical space in troff.

   3. Emit the horizontal rule (see [I4.CSTR49] for details); an equals
      sign instead of an underscore produces a double rule.

   4. In troff, move to 1 text line below the previously-marked vertical
      position.  This corresponds to the vertical position produced by
      nroff after a horizontal rule.

   Different implementations of tbl produce slightly different output.
   For example, horizontal rules in text output are sometimes produced
   with a series of underscore characters; other implementations may use
   dash (hyphen) characters.  While underscoring looks more attractive

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

   in heading rules than hyphens, it can interact poorly with text when
   used within a table.

   Some implementations of tbl require extensions specific to a
   particular implementation of formatters.

A.3.6. ABNF

   ABNF as described in [I18.RFC2234] can be difficult to format.  ABNF
   could be formatted manually as one or more displays, or tbl could be
   used to align related sets of ABNF rules.  Both of those options
   require significant manual effort.

   Another option is to use a preprocessor that reads free-form ABNF and
   formats it for presentation.  A tool is available to parse and format
   ABNF-like grammar descriptions (it requires comments not associated
   with any rule to begin without whitespace before the semicolon
   (unlike RFC 2234) and does not require an old-fashioned teletype
   "carriage return" control character before the end-of-line (also
   unlike RFC 2234)).  ABNF is provided between macro lines AS and AE
   (ABNF start and ABNF end).  Within that ABNF section, another macro,
   BC, is recognized.  It causes the current (or subsequent) rule to be
   formatted with block comments, that is, the comments appear in a
   block to the right of the rule definition with running comment text
   formatted in a block approximately the same height as the ABNF
   definition.

   For example, the input:

.AS 6 72 cgsntr
FWS = ( [ *WSP CRLF ] 1*WSP ) / obs-FWS  ; Folding white space


.BC
ctext  =   NO-WS-CTL /     ; Non white space controls.
                        %d33-39 /       ; The rest of the US-ASCII
     %d42-91 /       ;  characters not including "(",
                        %d93-126        ;  ")", or "

ccontent   =       ctext/quoted-pair/COMMENT
comment         =  "(" *([FWS] ccontent) [FWS] ")"
CFWS=*([FwS] comment) (([fws] comment) / fWs)
.AE

   produces formatted ABNF which looks like:

      CFWS     = *([FWS] comment) (([FWS] comment) / FWS)

      comment  = "(" *([FWS] ccontent) [FWS] ")"

      ccontent = ctext / quoted-pair / comment

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

      ctext    = NO-WS-CTL /        ; Non white space controls. The rest
                 %d33-39 / %d42-91  ; of the US-ASCII characters not
                 / %d93-126         ; including "(", ")", or "

      FWS      = ([*WSP CRLF] 1*WSP) / obs-FWS ; Folding white space

   Each rule is placed in a separate display by the ABNF preprocessor so
   that an ABNF rule won't be split across a page break.  Optional
   arguments to the AS macro are numbers (not troff register references,
   etc.)  which indicate the indent and line length in characters, and
   one-character option flags which control processing:

   Flag                          Description
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    c  canonicalize case of character literals; type (letter after '%')
       is lower-case, hexadecimal digit letters are upper-case.
       Rulename references use the same case as the defining ABNF line.
    d  omit display wrappers around output rules, instead separating
       rules with an empty line.  This may be useful if the entire ABNF
       is placed within a display wrapper.
    g  group concatenated elements in parentheses if in an alternation
       expression
    n  normalize repetition specifications: 0*1foo becomes [foo], M[foo
       bar] becomes *M(foo bar), etc.
    s  Combine adjacent quoted strings into a single quoted string
       where possible
    t  topologically sort rules in a ruleset so that productions are
       defined before use
    r  reverse the sense of topological sorting; use precedes
       definition (ineffective if the t flag is not specified)

A.3.7. Client-Server Protocol Exchanges

   Some documents illustrate client server exchanges such as:

   S: 220 foo.example.net

   C: helo bar.example.com

   S: 250 blah blah blah

   C: quit

   S: 221 Go in peace

   Depending on the specific protocol and how it is desired to be
   formatted and grouped, displays, paragraphs, a list, or a table might
   be used to format such an exchange.  The example above uses a single
   indented display, specified as:

   S: 220 foo.example.net

   C: helo bar.example.com

   S: 250 blah blah blah

   C: quit

   S: 221 Go in peace

   Lists items are implemented as paragraphs, so formatting as
   paragraphs will look the same.  The list was specified as:

.VL

220 foo.example.net

helo bar.example.com

   The table was specified by:

A.4. Postprocessing

   Scripts are available for use with the awk [I19.awk] interpreter for
   postprocessing of text and PostScript formatter output (primarily to
   reorder pages so that the Table of Contents appears in the correct
   location, although the postprocessor for text also removes
   overstriking).  A sed [I20.sed] script is available to assist in
   preparation of HTML formatting.

A.5. Proofreading and Checking Output

   It is so easy to incorporate references that it is easy to
   unintentionally include a given reference more than once.  While
   authors can generally be nonchalant about formatting of references,
   references should be proofread carefully to check for duplicates,
   references categorized as normative which should instead be
   informative or vice versa, etc.

   Henrik Levkowetz' "idnits" program [I14.idnits] is useful for
   catching diagrams and tables that exceed the maximum allowed line
   length.

Appendix B. Macros Specifically for the RFC Editor

   In addition to the NU, FN, UD, OB, IS, and CA macros discussed in the
   body of this memo, there are several macros intended for RFC Editor
   (rather than author) use.  They are described in this Appendix.

B.1. IESG Notes

   The IN macro takes a single numeric argument indicating the type of
   IESG note to be included; some types take a second argument:

   Type  2nd Argument                         Text
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

                         this document and IETF work.

   Type  2nd Argument                         Text
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    2    Working Group   The IESG thinks that this work is related to
                         IETF work done in WG Working Group, but this
                         does not prevent publishing.
    3    Working Group   The IESG thinks that publication is harmful to
                         the IETF work done in WG Working Group and
                         recommends not publishing the document at this
                         time.
    4    Procedure       The IESG thinks that this document violates
                         IETF procedures for Procedure and should
                         therefore not be published without IETF review
                         and IESG approval.
    5    none            The IESG thinks that this document extends an
                         IETF protocol in a way that requires IETF
                         review and should therefore not be published
                         without IETF review and IESG approval.
    6    none            The content of this RFC was at one time
                         considered by the IETF, and therefore it may
                         resemble a current IETF work in progress or a
                         published IETF work.  This RFC is not a
                         candidate for any level of Internet Standard.
                         The IETF disclaims any knowledge of the

                         particular notes that the decision to publish
                         is not based on IETF review for such things as

                         interaction with deployed protocols.  The RFC

                         exercise caution in evaluating its value for
                         implementation and deployment.  See RFC 3932
                         for more information.
    7    none            This RFC is not a candidate for any level of

                         knowledge of the fitness of this RFC for any
                         purpose and in particular notes that the

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

   Type  2nd Argument                         Text
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    8    none            This RFC is not a candidate for any level of
                         Internet Standard.  The IETF disclaims any
                         knowledge of the fitness of this RFC for any
                         purpose and notes that the decision to publish
                         is not based on IETF review apart from IESG
                         review for conflict with IETF work.  The RFC
                         Editor has chosen to publish this document at
                         its discretion.  See RFC 3932 for more
                         information.

   If a type of 0 (zero) is specified, text after the IN macro line is
   collected.  The RFC Editor can use this feature to incorporate an
   IESG notice other then the ones prescribed in [N4.BCP78] as listed in
   the table above.

   The IN macro should be placed in the front matter (before the first
   SH or NH macro).  The corresponding note will be formatted as an
   unnumbered section appearing before the Abstract.  If no IN macro
   call is placed in the front matter section, no IESG note will be
   included in the document.

B.2. Alternate Document Type and Number

   Some RFCs are also BCP, STD, or FYI documents.  The RFC Editor may
   indicate such a document type and number via the AN macro.  It takes
   two arguments; the type (which must be one of BCP, STD, or FYI) and
   the number corresponding to that type.  The information is placed in
   the first page heading, properly formatted.  The AN macro should also
   be placed in the front matter.

Appendix C. Document Progression Using the rfc Macros

C.1. Initial Internet-Draft

   An initial draft using the rfc macros should specify a draft number
   version of 00 by supplying a -1 argument to the NU macro or via
   command-line specification of register N.  The latter may be
   accomplished by editing a line in the Makefile.  Document category
   (CA macro) can be ignored, or can be specified to indicate intended
   status.  The draft file name (see [N3.ID]) should be specified via
   the FN macro.  Long (TL) and short (ST) titles need to be specified,
   as well as author(s) or editor(s) (AU or ED macro(s)) and Table of
   Contents parameters (TC macro or command-line register
   specifications).  An Abstract (AB macro) is required.  The remainder
   of the document is specified by defining sections, paragraphs, lists,
   and references, plus any diagrams or other non-textual material.

   The document is then formatted and the text version submitted as an
   Internet-Draft [N3.ID].

   During processing, the rfc macro package checks for certain types of
   errors and issues warnings and other messages.  If such a message

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

   appears, it is advisable to consider a revision to the document or
   other appropriate action.

C.2. Subsequent Draft Revisions

   Each revision involves updating the argument to the NU macro or
   command-line register N specification (sequencing to -2, then -3,
   etc.) and making desired changes to the content.  Note that if the
   file name is changed, the numbering must be restarted at 00.  If a
   Makefile is used, it too should be updated to reflect the revised
   version numbering.

   The document is reformatted and resubmitted as a revised Draft
   [N3.ID].

C.3. Publication as an RFC

   The Abstract may be retained (possibly edited) or removed.  Document
   category should be specified in consultation with the IETF or RFC
   Editor.  The document number should be left unspecified (0 (zero)
   argument to the NU macro or command-line register N specification);
   the RFC Editor will assign an RFC number at the time of publication.
   The document is reformatted and sent to the RFC Editor.  By prior
   arrangement with the RFC Editor, the document source can be sent, as
   that may simplify final formatting by the RFC Editor.

   There are also subdirectories containing source code and related
   files for the ABNF formatter and reference formatter preprocessors.

   If the macros and related tools are deemed useful, it is hoped that
   they might be relocated to the RFC Editor site.

Appendix E. Summary of Directives

   The following table summarizes rfc macro directives in alphabetical
   order (macros specific to preprocessors and internal use macros are
   omitted).  The section number containing detailed information about
   each macro is listed.

Appendix G. Disclaimers

   This document has exactly one (1) author.

   In spite of the fact that the author's given name may also be the
   surname of other individuals, and the fact that the author's surname
   may also be a given name for some females, the author is, and has
   always been, male.

   The presence of "or she", "/SHE", "each", "their", and "authors"
   (plural) in the boilerplate sections of this document is irrelevant.

Internet-Draft      Writing I-Ds and RFCs using troff           May 2005

   The author of this document is not responsible for the boilerplate
   text.

   Comments regarding the silliness, lack of accuracy, and lack of
   precision of the boilerplate text should be directed to the IESG, not
   to the author.
