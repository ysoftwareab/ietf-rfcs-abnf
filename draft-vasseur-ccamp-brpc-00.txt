1.  History

   The aim of this document is to specify a Backward Recursive PCE-based
   Computation (BRPC) procedure to compute shortest constrained inter-
   domain (G)MPLS TE LSP.  Such procedure had been initially documented
   in draft-vasseur-ccamp-inter-domain-path-comp (Scenario 2) and is now
   moved to a separated ID in the light of the progress made by the PCE
   Working Group.  Note that the protocol extensions related to the PCEP
   protocol (see [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep]) may be moved in a separate
   document.


2.  Terminology

   ABR Routers: routers used to connect two IGP areas (areas in OSPF or
   levels in IS-IS).

   ASBR Routers: routers used to connect together ASes of a different or
   the same Service Provider via one or more Inter-AS links.

   Boundary LSR: a boundary LSR is either an ABR in the context of
   inter- area TE or an ASBR in the context of inter-AS TE.

   Inter-AS TE LSP: A TE LSP that crosses an AS boundary.

   Inter-area TE LSP: A TE LSP that crosses an IGP area.

   LSR: Label Switch Router.

   LSP: Label Switched Path.

   PCE: Path Computation Element: an entity (component, application or
   network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route
   based on a network graph and applying computational constraints.

   TED: Traffic Engineering Database.

   The notion of contiguous, stitched and nested TE LSPs is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-rsvp-te] and will not be repeated here.


3.  Introduction

   The requirements for inter-area and inter-AS MPLS Traffic Engineering
   have been developed by the Traffic Engineering Working Group (TE WG)
   and have been stated in [RFC4105] and [RFC4216] respectively.

   The framework for inter-domain MPLS Traffic Engineering has been

   provided in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-framework].

   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-pd-path-comp] proposes a path
   computation technique for computing inter-domain (G)MPLS TE LSP
   whereby the path is computed on a per-domain basis by the entry
   border node of each domain (each node in charge of computing a
   section of an inter-domain TE LSP path is always along the path of
   such TE LSP).  Such path computation technique fulfills some of the
   requirements stated in [RFC4105] and [RFC4216]but not all of them.
   In particular, it cannot guarantee to find an optimal (shortest)
   inter-domain constrained path.  Furthermore, it cannot be efficiently
   used to compute a set of inter-domain diversely routed TE LSP.

   The aim of this document is to describe a PCE-based TE LSP
   computation procedure to compute optimal inter-domain constrained
   (G)MPLS TE LSPs.  Although one model consists of making the boundary
   routers act as PCE, the Backward Recursive PCE-based Computation
   (BRPC) procedure is not limited to that model.

   Qualifying a path as optimal requires some clarification.  Indeed, a
   globally optimal TE LSP placement usually refers to a set of TE LSPs
   whose placements optimize the network resources with regards to a
   specified objective function (i.e a placement that reduces the
   maximum or average network load for instance).  In this document, an
   optimal inter-domain constrained TE LSP is defined as the shortest
   path, satisfying the set of required constraints, that would be
   obtained in the absence of multiple domains (in other words, in a
   totally flat network between the source and destination of the TE
   LSP).  The mechanisms proposed in this document are also applicable
   to (G)MPLS TE domains other than areas and ASs.


4.  General assumptions

   In the rest of this document, we make the following set of
   assumptions common to inter-area and inter-AS TE:

   - Each area or AS is assumed to be capable of doing Traffic
   Engineering (i.e. running OSPF-TE or ISIS-TE and RSVP-TE).

   - No topology or resource information is distributed between domains
   (as mandated per [RFC4105] and [RFC4216]), which is critical to
   preserve IGP/BGP scalability and confidentiality in the case of TE
   LSPs spanning multiple domains.

   - While certain constraints like bandwidth can be used across
   different domains, certain other TE constraints like resource
   affinity, color, metric, etc. as listed in [RFC2702] could be

   translated at domain boundaries.  If required, it is assumed that, at
   the domain boundary LSRs, there will exist some sort of local mapping
   based on offline policy agreement, in order to translate such
   constraints across domain boundaries during the inter-PCE
   communication process.

   - The various ASBRs are BGP peers, without any IGP running on the
   inter-ASBR links.

   - Each AS can be made of several IGP areas.  The path computation
   procedure described in this document applies to the case of a single
   AS made of multiple IGP areas, multiples ASs made of a single IGP
   areas or any combination of the above.  For the sake of simplicity,
   each AS will be considered to be comprised of a single area in this
   document.  The case of an Inter-AS TE LSP spanning multiple ASs where
   some of those ASs are themselves made of multiple IGP areas can be
   easily derived from this case by applying the BRPC procedure
   described in this document, recursively.


5.  BRPC Procedure

   The BRPC procedure is a Multi-PCE path computation technique as
   described in [I-D.ietf-pce-architecture].  A possible model consists
   of hosting the PCE function on boundary routers (e.g.  ABR or ASBR)
   but this is not mandated by the BRPC path computation procedure.

   BRPC does not make any assumptions with regards to the nature of the
   inter-domain TE LSP that could be contiguous, nested or stitched.

   No assumption is made on the actual path computation algorithm in use
   by the PCE (it can be any variant of CSPF, algorithm based on linear-
   programming to solve multi-constraints optimization problems and so
   on).

5.1.  Next-hop PCE discovery

   The BRPC path computation procedure applies to the computation of an
   optimal constrained inter-domain TE LSP once the sequence of domains
   to be traversed has been determined.  In tree-based topologies, the
   set of possible domains to be traversed is reduced to a single
   element (generally the case of Inter-area MPLS TE).  When such set
   comprises more than one element (there exists more than one possible
   set of domains to reach the destination), procedures can be defined
   on the PCC to enforce the set of traversed domains.  Alternatively,
   such selection can be made on the hop-by-hop basis relying on PCE
   discovery mechanism (e.g. using domain scope IGP advertisements as
   specified in [I-D.ietf-pce-disco-proto-igp]).

5.2.  Elements of procedure

   Terminology

   - PCE(i) is a PCE with the scope of domain(i).

   - Boundary Router (BR): ABR or ASBR.

   - Entry BR of domain(n): a BR connecting domain(n-1) to domain(n).

   - Exit BR of domain(n): a BR connecting domain(n) to domain(n+1).

   - In each domain i:

   * a set of X-en(i) entry BRs noted BR-en(k,i) where BR-en(k,i) is the
   kth entry BR of domain(i).

   * a set of X-ex(i) exit BR noted BR-ex(k,i) where BR-ex(k,i) is the
   kth exit BR of domain(i).  Definition of VSPT(i)

   A virtual shortest path tree VSPT(i) returned by PCE(i) to PCE(i-1)
   has the following form:


            Root (TE LSP destination)
               /         I            \
         BR-en(1,i)   BR-en(2,i) ... BR-en((j), i).

   Where j<= [X-en(i)]



   Each link of VSPT(i) represents the shortest path between the
   destination and BR-en(j,i) that satisfies the set of required
   constraints for the TE LSP (bandwidth, affinities, ...).  These are
   path segments to reach the destination from BR-en(j,i).

   Note that just BR having connectivity with some BR of domain(i-1)
   must be considered.  Furthermore, some BRs may be excluded according
   to policy constraints (either due to local policy or policies
   signaled in the path computation request).

   Step 1: the PCC needs to first determine the PCE capable of serving
   its path computation request.  The path computation request is then
   relayed until reaching a PCE(n) such that the TE LSP destination
   resides in the domain(n).  At each step of the process, the next PCE
   can either be statically configured or dynamically discovered via
   IGP/BGP extensions.  If multiple PCEs are discovered, the PCE may

Internet-Draft       draft-vasseur-ccamp-brpc-00.txt       February 2006


   select a subset of these PCEs based on some local policies/
   heuristics.  Note also that a sequence of PCEs might be enforced by
   policy on the PCC and this constraint can be either carried in the
   PCECP path computation request or applied to the computed VSPT.

   Step 2: PCE(n) computes VSPT(n) made of the list of shortest
   constrained path(s) between every BR-en(j,n) and the TE LSP
   destination using a suitable path computation algorithm (e.g.  CSPF).

   Step 3: PCE(n) returns the VSPT(n) to PC(n-1).

   - For i=n-1 to 2:

   PCE(i) concatenates the ASi topology (using its TED) with the
   received VSPT(i+1) and computes VSPT(i).

   In the case of Inter-AS TE, this operation also includes the links
   connecting ASBRs of ASi and ASi+1.

   End

   Each branch of the VSPT tree (path) may be returned in the form of an
   explicit path (in which case all the hops along the path segment are
   listed) or a loose path (in which case only the BR is specified) so
   as to preserve confidentiality.

   Note: in term of computation of an inter-AS TE LSP path, an
   interesting optimization consists of allowing the ASBRs to flood the
   TE information related to the inter-ASBR link(s) although no IGP TE
   is enabled over those links (and so there is no IGP adjacency over
   the inter-ASBR links).  This of course implies for the inter-ASBR
   links to be TE-enabled although no IGP is running on those links.
   This allows the PCE of a domain to get entire TE visibility up to the
   set of entry ASBRs in the downstream domain.

   A PCE MAY decide to support local caching of path computation in
   order to optimize the path computation process.  The downside of path
   caching is the potential increase of call set up failure.  When
   caching is in use, it must be flushed upon TE LSP set up failure
   provided that the PCE is along the inter-area/AS TE LSP path.  BRPC
   guarantees to find the optimal (shortest) constrained inter-domain TE
   LSP according to a set of defined domains to be traversed.  Note that
   other variants of the BRPC procedure relying on the same principles
   are also possible.  Note also that in case of ECMP paths, more than
   one path could be returned to the requesting LSR.  The BRPC procedure
   may be used to compute path segments and could be used in conjunction
   with other path computation techniques (such as the per-domain path
   computation technique defined in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-inter-domain-pd-

   path-comp]) to compute the end-to-end path.  In this case end-to-end
   path optimality can no longer be guaranteed.


6.  PCEP Protocol Extensions

   The BRPC path computation procedure requires the specification of a
   new PCEP (see [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep]) object carried within a PCReq
   message sent by a PCC to a PCE or by a PCE to another PCE so as to
   request from a downstream PCE the set of shortest constrained path(s)
   from the destination to a set of entry boundary routers.  Indeed, the
   END-POINTS object specified in PCEP makes the assumption that both
   the source and the destination are known by the requester.  Due to
   potential lack of visibility of the entry boundary routers of the
   downstream domain (e.g.  Inter-AS MPLS TE case) the set of entry
   boundary router in a downstream domain may not be known by the
   requesting PCC: this requires to specify a new PCEP object named VSPT
   for the purpose of the BRPC path computation procedure where the VSPT
   object is used in a PCReq message so as to request from a downstream
   PCE the VSPT from the destination to all entry BRs satisfy the
   constraints.

   Because path segment(s) computed by a downstream PCE in the context
   of the BRPC procedure must be provided along with their respective
   path cost(s), the C flag of the RP object carried within the PCReq
   message MUST be set.  It is the choice of the requester to
   appropriately set the O bit of the RP object.

   VSPT Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA (recommended value=14)

   VSPT Object-Type is to be assigned by IANA (recommended value=1)

   The destination IP address of the VSPT object corresponds to the VSPT
   root (TE LSP's destination) and is provided by the PCC originating
   the path computation request.

   No Flags are currently defined.


7.  Meric normalization

   In the case of inter-area TE, the same IGP/TE metric scheme is
   usually adopted for all the IGP areas (e.g. based on the link-speed,
   propagation delay or some other combination of link attributes).
   Hence, the proposed set of mechanism always computes the shortest
   path across multiple areas obeying the required set of constraints
   with respect to a well-specified objective function.  Conversely, in
   the case of Inter-AS TE, in order for this path computation to be
   meaningful, a metric normalization between ASs may be required.  One
   solution to avoid IGP metric modification would be for the SPs to
   agree on a TE metric normalization scheme and use the TE metric for
   TE LSP path computation (in that case, this must be requested in the
   Path computation request) thanks to the COST object.

8.  Diverse en-to-end path computation

   The PCEP protocol allows an LSR to request the computation of a set
   of diversely routed TE LSPs.  In the context of the BRPC procedure, a
   set of diversely routed TE LSP between two LSRs can be computed since
   the paths segment(s) of the VSPT are simultaneously computed by a
   given PCE.  Such a PCE-based path computation method allows for the
   computation of diverse paths under various objective functions (such
   as minimizing the sum of the costs of the N diverse paths, etc) in a
   very efficient manner, thus avoiding the well-known "trapping"
   problem: Indeed, with a 2-step approach consisting of computing the
   first path followed by the computation of the second path after
   having removed the set of network elements traversed by the first
   path (if that does not violate confidentiality preservation), one
   cannot guarantee that a solution will be found even if such solution
   exists.  Furthermore, even if a solution is found, it may not be the
   most optimal one with respect to objective function such as
   minimizing the sum of the paths costs, bounding the path delays of
   both paths and so on.  Finally, it must be noted that such a 2-step
   path computation approach is usually less efficient in term of
   signalling delays since it requires two serialized TE LSP set up.


9.  Path optimality

   BRPC guarantees that the optimal (shortest) constrained inter-domain
   path will always be found.  It must be noted that although the BRPC
   procedure applies to any type of inter-domain TE LSP (e.g.
   contiguous, stitched or nested), the use of local reoptimization with
   a stitched TE LSP may no longer guarantee to preserve the path
   optimality of the end-to-end path should the BRPC procedure be used
   in the first place.


10.  10. Reoptimization of an inter-domain TE LSP

   The ability to reoptimize an existing inter-domain TE LSP path has
   been explicitly listed as a requirement in [RFC4105] and [RFC4216].
   In the case of a TE LSP reoptimization request, regular procedures
   apply as defined in PCEP where the path in use (if available on the
   head-end) is provided within the path computation request in order
   for the PCEs involved in the reoptimization request to avoid double
   bandwidth accounting.


11.  IANA Considerations

   A new PCEP object is defined in this document that has an Object-

   Class and an Object-Type.  The new Object-Class and Object-Type
   should be assigned by IANA.

   VSPT Object

   The Object-Class of the VSPT object is to be assigned by IANA
   (recommended value=14).

   One Object-Type is defined for this object and should be assigned by
   IANA with a recommended value of 1.


12.  Security Considerations

   The BRPC procedure does not introduce any additional security issues
   beyond the ones related to inter-PCE communication.
