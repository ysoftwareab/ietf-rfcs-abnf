Open Research Issues in Internet Congestion Control        August 2008 
 
 
1. Introduction 
    
   This document describes some of the open research topics in the 
   domain of Internet congestion control that are known today. We begin 
   by reviewing some proposed definitions of congestion and congestion 
   control based on current understandings. 
 
   Congestion can be defined as the reduction in utility due to overload 
   in networks that support both spatial and temporal multiplexing, but 
   no reservation [Keshav07]. Congestion control is a (typically 
   distributed) algorithm to share network resources among competing 
   traffic sources. Two components of distributed congestion control 
   have been defined in the context of prima-dual modeling [Kelly98]. 
   Primal congestion control refers to the algorithm executed by the 
   traffic sources algorithm for controlling their sending rates or 
   window sizes. This is normally a closed-loop control, where this 
   operation depends on feedback. TCP algorithms fall in this category. 
   Dual congestion control is implemented by the routers through 
   gathering information about the traffic traversing them. A dual 
   congestion control algorithm updates, implicitly or explicitly, a 
   congestion measure and sends it back, implicitly or explicitly, to 
   the traffic sources that use that link. Queue management algorithms 
   such as Random Early Detection (RED) [Floyd93] or Random Exponential 
   Marking (REM) [Ath01] fall in the "dual" category. 
    
   Congestion control provides for a fundamental set of mechanisms for 
   maintaining the stability and efficiency of the Internet. Congestion 
   control has been associated with TCP since Van Jacobson's work in 
   1988, but there is also congestion control outside of TCP (e.g. for 
   real-time multimedia applications, multicast, and router-based 
   mechanisms). The Van Jacobson end-to-end congestion control 
   algorithms [Jacobson88] [RFC2581] are used by the Internet transport 
   protocol TCP [RFC4614]. They have been proven to be highly successful 
   over many years but have begun to reach their limits, as the 
   heterogeneity of both the data link and physical layer and 
   applications are pulling TCP congestion control (which performs 
   poorly as the bandwidth or delay increases) outside of its natural 
   operating regime. A side effect of these deficits is that there is an 
   increasing share of hosts that use non-standardized congestion 
   control enhancements (for instance, many Linux distributions have 
   been shipped with "CUBIC" as default TCP congestion control 
   mechanism). 
    
   While the original Jacobson algorithm requires no congestion-related 
   state in routers, more recent modifications have departed from the 
   strict application of the end-to-end principle [Saltzer84]. Active 
   Queue Management (AQM) in routers, e.g., RED and its variants such as 
   xCHOKE [Pan00], RED with In/Out (RIO) [Clark98], improves performance 
   by keeping queues small (implicit feedback via dropped packets),

   while Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [Floyd94] [RFC3168] 
   passes one bit of congestion information back to senders when an AQM 
   would normally drop a packet. These measures do improve performance, 
   but there is a limit to how much can be accomplished without more 
   information from routers. The requirement of extreme scalability 
   together with robustness has been a difficult hurdle to accelerating 
   information flow. Primal-Dual TCP/AQM distributed algorithm stability 
   and equilibrium properties have been extensively studied (cf. [Low02] 
   [Low03]).   
    
   Congestion control includes many new challenges that are becoming 
   important as the network grows in addition to the issues that have 
   been known for many years. These are generally considered to be open 
   research topics that may require more study or application of 
   innovative techniques before Internet-scale solutions can be 
   confidently engineered and deployed. In what follows, an overview of 
   some of these challenges is given. 
    
2. Global Challenges   
    
   This section describes the global challenges to be addressed in the 
   domain of Internet congestion control. 
 
2.1 Heterogeneity 
    
   The Internet encompasses a large variety of heterogeneous IP networks 
   that are realized by a multitude of technologies, which result in a 
   tremendous variety of link and path characteristics: capacity can be 
   either scarce in very slow speed radio links (several kbps), or there 
   may be an abundant supply in high-speed optical links (several 
   gigabit per second). Concerning latency, scenarios range from local 
   interconnects (much less than a millisecond) to certain wireless and 
   satellite links with very large latencies (up to a second). Even 
   higher latencies can occur in interstellar communication.  As a 
   consequence, both the available bandwidth and the end-to-end delay in 
   the Internet may vary over many orders of magnitude, and it is likely 
   that the range of parameters will further increase in future. 
    
   Additionally, neither the available bandwidth nor the end-to-end 
   delay is constant. At the IP layer, competing cross-traffic, traffic 
   management in routers, and dynamic routing can result in sudden 
   changes of the characteristics of an end-to-end path. Additional 
   dynamics can be caused by link layer mechanisms, such as shared media 
   access (e.g., in wireless networks), changes of links 
   (horizontal/vertical handovers), topology modifications (e.g., in 
   ad-hoc networks), link layer error correction and dynamic bandwidth 
   provisioning schemes. From this follows that path characteristics can 
   be subject to substantial changes within short time frames.

Open Research Issues in Internet Congestion Control        August 2008 
 
 
   The congestion control algorithms have to deal with this variety in 
   an efficient way. The congestion control principles introduced by Van 
   Jacobson assume a rather static scenario and implicitly target 
   configurations where the bandwidth-delay product is of the order of 
   some dozens of packets at most. While these principles have proved to 
   work well in the Internet for almost two decades, much larger 
   bandwidth-delay products and increased dynamics challenge them more 
   and more. There are many situations where today's congestion control 
   algorithms react in a suboptimal way, resulting in low resource 
   utilization, non-optimal congestion avoidance, or unfairness. 
    
   This gave rise to a multitude of new proposals for congestion control 
   algorithms. For instance, since the Additive-Increase Multiplicative 
   Decrease (AIMD) behavior of TCP is too conservative in practical 
   environments when then congestion window is large, several high-speed 
   congestion control extensions have been developed. However, these new 
   algorithms raise fairness issues, and they may be less robust in 
   certain situations for which they have not been designed. Up to now, 
   there is still no common agreement in the IETF on which algorithm and 
   protocol to choose. 
    
   It is always possible to tune congestion control parameters based on 
   some knowledge about the environment and the application scenario. 
   However, the fundamental question is whether it is possible to define 
   one congestion control mechanism that operates reasonable well in the 
   whole range of scenarios that exist in the Internet. Hence, it is an 
   important research question how new Internet congestion control 
   mechanisms would have to be designed, which maximum degree of 
   dynamics it could efficiently handle, and whether it could keep the 
   genererality of the existing end-to-end solutions. 
    
   Some improvements of congestion control could be realized by simple 
   changes of single functions in end-system or network components. 
   However, new mechanism can also require a fundamental redesign of the 
   overall network architecture, and they may even affect the design of 
   Internet applications. This can imply significant interoperability 
   and backward compatibility challenges and/or create network 
   accessibility obstacles. In particular, networks and/or applications 
   that do not use or support a new congestion control mechanism could 
   be penalized by a significantly worse performance compared to what 
   they would get if everybody used the existing mechanisms (cf. the 
   discussion on fairness in Section 2.3). [RFC5033] defines several 
   criteria to evaluate the appropriateness of a new congestion control 
   mechanism. However, the fundamental question is how much performance 
   deterioration is acceptable for "legacy" applications. This tradeoff 
   between performance and cost has to be very carefully examined for 
   all new congestion control schemes.

2.2 Stability 
    
   Control theory, which is a mathematical tool for describing dynamic 
   systems, lends itself to modeling congestion control - TCP is a 
   perfect example of a typical "closed loop" system that can be 
   described in control theoretic terms. In control theory, there is a 
   mathematically defined notion of system stability. In a stable 
   system, for any bounded input over any amount of time, the output 
   will also be bounded. For congestion control, what is actually meant 
   with stability is typically asymptotic stability: a mechanism should 
   converge to a certain state irrespective of the initial state of the 
   network. 
    
   Control theoretic modeling of a realistic network can be quite 
   difficult, especially when taking distinct packet sizes and 
   heterogeneous RTTs into account. It has therefore become common 
   practice to model simpler cases and leave the more complicated 
   (realistic) situations for simulations. Clearly, if a mechanism is 
   not stable in a simple scenario, it is generally useless; this method 
   therefore helps to eliminate faulty congestion control candidates at 
   an early stage. 
    
   Some fundamental facts, which are known from control theory are 
   useful as guidelines when designing a congestion control mechanism. 
   For instance, a controller should only be fed a system state that 
   reflects its output. A (low-pass) filter function should be used in 
   order to pass only states to the controller that are expected to last 
   long enough for its action to be meaningful [Jain88]. Action should 
   be carried out whenever such feedback arrives, as it is a fundamental 
   principle of control that the control frequency should be equal to 
   the feedback frequency. Reacting faster leads to oscillations and 
   instability while reacting slower makes the system tardy [Jain90]. 
    
   TCP stability can be attributed to two key aspects which were 
   introduced in [Jacobson88]: the AIMD control law during congestion 
   avoidance, which is based on a simple, vector based analysis of two 
   controllers sharing one resource with synchronous RTTs [Chiu89], and 
   the "conservation of packets principle", which, once the control has 
   reached "steady state", tries to maintain an equal amount of packets 
   in flight at any time by only sending a packet into the network when 
   a packet has left the network (as indicated by an ACK arriving at the 
   sender). The latter aspect has guided many decisions regarding 
   changes that were made to TCP over the years.  
    
   The reasoning in [Jacobson88] assumes all senders to be acting at the 
   same time. The stability of TCP under more realistic network 
   conditions has been investigated in a large number of ensuing works, 
   leading to no clear conclusion that TCP would also be asymptotically 
   stable under arbitrary network conditions. The stability impact of

   Slow Start (which can be significant as short-lived HTTP flows often 
   never leave this phase) is also not entirely clear.  
    
2.3 Fairness 
    
   Recently, the way the Internet community reasons about fairness has 
   been called into deep questioning [Bri07]. Much of the community has 
   taken fairness to mean approximate equality between the rates of 
   flows (flow rate fairness) that experience equivalent path congestion 
   as with TCP [RFC2581] and TFRC [RFC3448]. [RFC3714] depicts the 
   resulting situation as "The Amorphous Problem of Fairness". 
    
   A parallel tradition has been built on [Kelly98] where, as long as 
   each user is accountable for the cost their rate causes to others 
   [MKMV95], the set of rates that everyone chooses is deemed fair (cost 
   fairness) - because with any other set of choices people would lose 
   more value than they gained overall.  
    
   In comparison, the debate between max-min, proportional and TCP 
   fairness is about mere details. These three all share the assumption 
   that equal flow rates are desirable; they merely differ in the second 
   order issue of how to share out excess capacity in a network of many 
   bottlenecks. In contrast, cost fairness should lead to extremely 
   unequal flow rates by design. Equivalently, equal flow rates would 
   typically be considered extremely unfair. 
    
   The two traditional approaches are not protocol options that can each 
   be followed in different parts of a network. They result in research 
   agendas and issues that are different in their respective objectives 
   resulting in different set of open issues.  
    
   If we assume TCP-friendliness as a goal with flow rate as the metric, 
   open issues would be: 
    
   - Should rate fairness depend on the packet rate or the bit rate? 
   - Should the flow rate depend on RTT (as in TCP) or should only flow  
     dynamics depend on RTT (e.g. as in Fast TCP [Jin04])? 
   - How to estimate whether a particular flow start strategy is fair,  
     or whether a particular fast recovery strategy after a reduction in  
     rate due to congestion is fair?  
   - How should we judge what is reasonably fair if an application  
     needs, for example, even smoother flows than TFRC, or it needs to  
     burst occasionally, or with any other application behavior?  
   - During brief congestion bursts (e.g. due to new flow arrivals) how 
     to judge at what point it becomes unfair for some flows to continue  
     at a smooth rate while others reduce their rate? 
   - Which mechanism(s) should be used to enforce approximate flow rate  
     fairness?  
   - How can we introduce some degree of fairness that takes account of

Open Research Issues in Internet Congestion Control        August 2008 
 
 
     flow duration? 
   - How to judge the fairness of applications using a large number of  
     flows over separate paths (e.g., via an overlay)? 
    
   If we assume cost fairness as a goal with congestion volume as the 
   metric, open issues would be: 
    
   - Can one application's sensitivity to instantaneous congestion  
     really be protected by longer-term accountability of competing  
     applications? 
   - Which protocol mechanism(s) should give accountability for causing  
     congestion? 
   - How to design one or two generic transport protocols (such as to   
     TCP, UDP, etc.) with the addition of application policy control? 
   - Which policy enforcement should be used by networks and which  
     interactions between application policy and network policy  
     enforcement? 
   - How to design a new policy enforcement framework that will  
     appropriately compete with existing flows aiming for rate equality          
     (e.g. TCP)? 
 
   The question of how to reason about fairness is a pre-requisite to 
   agreeing on the research agenda. However, that question does not 
   require more research in itself, it is merely a debate that needs to 
   be resolved by studying existing research and by assessing how bad 
   fairness problems could become if they are not addressed rigorously. 
 
3. Detailed Challenges 
    
3.1 Challenge 1: Router Support  
    
   Routers can be involved in congestion control in two ways: first, 
   they can implicitly optimize their functions, such as queue 
   management and scheduling strategies, in order to support the 
   operation of an end-to-end congestion control. Second, routers can 
   participate in congestion control via explicit notification 
   mechanisms. 
    
   In the first category, various approaches have been proposed and also 
   deployed, such as different AQM techniques. Even though these 
   implicit techniques are known to improve network performance during 
   congestion phases, they are still only partly deployed in the 
   Internet. This may be due to the fact that finding optimal and robust 
   parameterizations for these mechanisms is a non-trivial problem. 
   Indeed, the problem with various AQM schemes is the difficulty to 
   identify correct values of the parameter set that affects the 
   performance of the queuing scheme (due to variation in the number of 
   sources, the capacity and the feedback delay) [Fioriu00] [Hollot01] 
   [Zhang03]. Many AQM schemes (RED, REM, BLUE, PI-Controller but also

Open Research Issues in Internet Congestion Control        August 2008 
 
 
   Adaptive Virtual Queue (AVQ)) do not define a systematic rule for 
   setting their parameters. 
    
   By using explicit feedback from the network, connection endpoints can 
   obtain more accurate information about the current network 
   characteristics on the path. This allows endpoints to make more 
   precise decisions that can better prevent packet loss and that can 
   also improve fairness among different flows. Examples for explicit 
   router feedback include Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) 
   [RFC3168], Quick-Start [RFC4782], the eXplicit Control Protocol (XCP) 
   [Katabi02] [Falk07], the Rate Control Protocol (RCP) [Dukk06], and 
   CADPC/PTP [Welzl03]. 
    
   Explicit router feedback can address some of the inherent 
   shortcomings of TCP. For instance, XCP has been developed to overcome 
   the inefficiency, unfairness and instability that TCP suffers from 
   when the per-flow bandwidth-delay product increases. By decoupling 
   resource utilization/congestion control from fairness control, XCP 
   achieves fair bandwidth allocation, high utilization, a small 
   standing queue size, and near-zero packet drops, with both steady and 
   highly varying traffic. Importantly, XCP does not maintain any per-
   flow state in routers and requires few CPU cycles per packet, hence 
   making it potentially applicable in high-speed routers. However, XCP 
   is still subject to research: as [Andrew05] has pointed out, XCP is 
   locally stable but globally unstable when the maximum RTT of a flow 
   is much larger than the mean RTT. This instability can be removed by 
   changing the update strategy for the estimation interval, but this 
   makes the system vulnerable to erroneous RTT advertisements. The 
   authors of [PAP02] have shown that, when flows with different RTTs 
   are applied, XCP sometimes discriminates among heterogeneous traffic 
   flows, even if XCP is generally fair to different flows. [Low05] 
   provides for a complete characterization of the XCP equilibrium 
   properties.  
    
   Several other explicit router feedback schemes have been developed 
   with different design objectives. For instance, RCP uses a per-packet 
   feedback similar to XCP. Different to XCP, RCP focuses on the 
   reduction of flow completion times and therefore tolerates larger 
   instantaneous queue sizes [Dukk06]. 
    
   Both implicit and explicit router support should be considered in the 
   context of the end-to-end argument [Saltzer84], which is one of the 
   key design principles of the Internet. It suggests that functions 
   that can be realized both in the end-systems and in the network 
   should be implemented in the end-systems. This principle ensures that 
   the network provides a general service and that remains as simple as 
   possible (any additional complexity is placed above the IP layer, 
   i.e., at the edges) so as to ensure reliability and robustness. In 
   particular, this means that Internet protocols should not rely on the

   maintenance of applicative state (i.e., information about the state 
   of the end-to-end communication) inside the network [RFC1958] and 
   that the network state (e.g. routing state) maintained by the 
   Internet shall minimize its interaction with the states maintained at 
   the end-points/hosts.  
    
   However, as discussed for instance in [Moors02], congestion control 
   cannot be realized as a pure end-to-end function only. Congestion is 
   an inherent network phenomenon and can only be resolved efficiently 
   by some cooperation of end-systems and the network. Congestion 
   control in today's Internet protocols follows the end-to-end design 
   principle insofar as only minimal feedback from the network is used 
   (e. g., packet loss and delay). The end-systems only decide how to 
   react and how to avoid congestion. The crux is that, on the one hand, 
   there would be substantial benefit by further assistance from the 
   network, but, on the other hand, such router support could lead to 
   duplication of functions, which might even harmfully interact with 
   end-to-end protocol mechanisms. The different requirements of 
   applications (cf. the fairness discussion in Section 2.3) call for a 
   variety of different congestion control approaches, but putting such 
   application-specific behavior inside the network should be avoided, 
   as such design would clearly be at odds with the end-to-end design 
   principle. 
    
   The end-to-end argument is generally regarded as a key ingredient for 
   ensuring a scalable network design. In order to ensure that new 
   congestion control mechanisms are scalable, violating this principle 
   must therefore be avoided. 
    
   In general, router support raises many issues that have not been 
   completely solved yet. 
    
3.1.1 Performance and robustness 
    
   Congestion control is subject to some tradeoffs: on one hand, it must 
   allow high link utilizations and fair resource sharing but on the 
   other hand, the algorithms must also be robust and conservative in 
   particular during congestion phases. 
      
   Router support can help to improve performance and fairness, but it 
   can also result in additional complexity and more control loops. This 
   requires a careful design of the algorithms in order to ensure 
   stability and avoid e.g. oscillations. A further challenge is the 
   fact that information may be imprecise. For instance, severe 
   congestion can delay feedback signals. Also, the measurement of 
   parameters such as RTTs or data rates may contain estimation errors. 
   Even though there has been significant progress in providing 
   fundamental theoretical models for such effects, research has not 
   completely explored the whole problem space yet.

   Open questions are:  
    
   - How much can routers theoretically improve performance in the  
     complete range of communication scenarios that exists in the  
     Internet without damaging or impacting end-to-end mechanisms  
     already in place?  
    
   - Is it possible to design robust mechanisms that offer significant  
     benefits without additional risks? 
 
   - What is the minimum support that is needed from routers in order 
     to achieve significantly better performance than with end-to-end  
     mechanisms? 
    
3.1.2 Granularity of router functions 
    
   There are several degrees of freedom concerning router involvement, 
   ranging from some few additional functions in network management 
   procedures one the one end, and additional per packet processing on 
   the other end of the solution space. Furthermore, different amounts 
   of state can be kept in routers (no per-flow state, partial per-flow 
   state, soft state, hard state). The additional router processing is a 
   challenge for Internet scalability and could also increase end-to-end 
   latencies. 
    
   There are many solutions that do not require per-flow state and thus 
   do not cause a large processing overhead. However, scalability issues 
   could also be caused, for instance, by synchronization mechanisms for 
   state information among parallel processing entities, which are e. g. 
   used in high-speed router hardware designs. 
    
   Open questions are:  
    
   - What granularity of router processing can be realized without    
     affecting Internet scalability?  
    
   - How can additional processing efforts be kept at a minimum? 
 
3.1.3 Information acquisition 
    
   In order to support congestion control, routers have to obtain at 
   least a subset of the following information. Obtaining that 
   information may result in complex tasks. 
    
   1. Capacity of (outgoing) links 
    
   Link characteristics depend on the realization of lower protocol 
   layers. Routers do not necessarily know the link layer network 
 
 
Welzl & Papadimitriou   Expires February 2009                [Page 11] 

Open Research Issues in Internet Congestion Control        August 2008 
 
 
   topology and link capacities, and these are not always constant (e. 
   g., on shared wireless links). Depending on the network technology, 
   there can be queues or bottlenecks that are not directly visible at 
   the IP layer. Difficulties also arise when using IP-in-IP tunnels 
   [RFC2003] or MPLS [RFC3031] [RFC3032]. In these cases, link 
   information could be determined by cross-layer information exchange, 
   but this requires link layer technology specific interfaces. An 
   alternative could be online measurements, but this can cause 
   significant additional network overhead. 
    
   2. Traffic carried over (outgoing) links 
    
   Accurate online measurement of data rates is challenging when traffic 
   is bursty. For instance, measuring a "current link load" requires 
   defining the right measurement interval/ sampling interval. This is a 
   challenge for proposals that require knowledge e.g. about the current 
   link utilization. 
    
   3. Internal buffer statistics  
    
   Some proposals use buffer statistics such as a virtual queue length 
   to trigger feedback.  However, routers can include multiple 
   distributed buffer stages that make it difficult to obtain such 
   metrics. 
    
   Open questions are: Can and should this information be made 
   available, e.g., by additional interfaces or protocols? 
 
3.1.4 Feedback signaling 
    
   Explicit notification mechanisms can be realized either by in-band 
   signaling (notifications piggybacked along with the data traffic) or 
   by out-of-band signaling. The latter case requires additional 
   protocols and can be further subdivided into path-coupled and path-
   decoupled approaches. 
    
   Open questions concerning feedback signaling include:  
    
   - At which protocol layer should the feedback signaling occur  
     (IP/network layer assisted, transport layer assisted, hybrid   
     solutions, shim layer, intermediate sub-layer, etc.) ? 
    
   - What is the optimal frequency of feedback (only in case of  
     congestion events, per RTT, per packet, etc.)? 
    
3.2 Challenge 2: Corruption Loss 
    
   It is common for congestion control mechanisms to interpret packet 
   loss as a sign of congestion. This is appropriate when packets are 
 
 
Welzl & Papadimitriou   Expires February 2009                [Page 12] 

Open Research Issues in Internet Congestion Control        August 2008 
 
 
   dropped in routers because of a queue that overflows, but there are 
   other possible reasons for packet drops. In particular, in wireless 
   networks, packets can be dropped because of corruption, rendering the 
   typical reaction of a congestion control mechanism inappropriate.  
    
   TCP over wireless and satellite is a topic that has been investigated 
   for a long time [Krishnan04]. There are some proposals where the 
   congestion control mechanism would react as if a packet had not been 
   dropped in the presence of corruption (cf. TCP HACK [Balan01]), but 
   discussions in the IETF have shown that there is no agreement that 
   this type of reaction is appropriate. For instance, it has been said 
   that congestion can manifest itself as corruption on shared wireless 
   links, and it is questionable whether a source that sends packets 
   that are continuously impaired by link noise should keep sending at a 
   high rate. 
    
   Generally, two questions must be addressed when designing congestion 
   control mechanism that takes corruption into account: 
    
   1. How is corruption detected? 
    
   2. What should be the reaction? 
    
   In addition to question 1 above, it may be useful to consider 
   detecting the reason for corruption, but this has not yet been done 
   to the best of our knowledge. 
    
   Corruption detection can be done using an in-band or out-of-band 
   signaling mechanism, much in the same way as described for 
   Challenge 1. Additionally, implicit detection can be considered: link 
   layers sometimes retransmit erroneous frames, which can cause the 
   end-to-end delay to increase - but, from the perspective of a sender 
   at the transport layer, there are many other possible reasons for 
   such an effect.  
    
   Header checksums provide another implicit detection possibility: if a 
   checksum only covers all the necessary header fields and this 
   checksum does not show an error, it is possible for errors to be 
   found in the payload using a second checksum. Such error detection is 
   possible with UDP-Lite and DCCP; it was found to work well over a 
   GPRS network in a study [Chester04] and poorly over a WiFi network in 
   another study [Rossi06] [Welzl08]. Note that, while UDP-Lite and DCCP 
   enable the detection of corruption, the specifications of these 
   protocols do not foresee any specific reaction to it for the time 
   being. 
    
   The idea of having a transport endpoint detect and accordingly react 
   to corruption poses a number of interesting questions regarding 
   cross-layer interactions. As IP is designed to operate over arbitrary 
 
 
Welzl & Papadimitriou   Expires February 2009                [Page 13] 

Open Research Issues in Internet Congestion Control        August 2008 
 
 
   link layers, it is therefore difficult to design a congestion control 
   mechanism on top of it, which appropriately reacts to corruption - 
   especially as the specific data link layers that are in use along an 
   end-to-end path are typically unknown to entities at the transport 
   layer.  
    
   While the IETF has not yet specified how a congestion control 
   mechanism should react to corruption, proposals exist in the 
   literature. For instance, TCP Westwood sets the congestion window 
   equal to the measured bandwidth at time of congestion in response to 
   three DupACKs or a timeout. This measurement is obtained by counting 
   and filtering the ACK rate. This setting provides a significant 
   goodput improvement in noisy channels because the "blind" by half 
   window reduction of standard TCP is avoided, i.e. the window is not 
   reduced by too much [Mascolo01]. 
    
   Open questions concerning corruption loss include: 
    
   - How should corruption loss be detected? 
    
   - How should a source react when it is known that corruption has 
     occurred? 
    
3.3 Challenge 3: Small Packets 
    
   Over past years, the performance of TCP congestion avoidance 
   algorithms has been extensively studied. The well known "square root 
   formula" provides the performance of the TCP congestion avoidance 
   algorithm for TCP Reno [RFC2581]. [Padhye98] enhances the model to 
   account for timeouts, receiver window, and delayed ACKs. 
    
   For the sake of the present discussion, we will assume that the TCP 
   throughput is expressed using the simplified formula. Using this 
   formula, the TCP throughput is proportional to the packet size and 
   inversely proportional to the RTT and the square root of the drop 
   probability:       
    
                      MSS   1 
                B ~ C --- ------- 
                      RTT sqrt(p) 
    
   where, 
    
         MSS is the TCP segment size (in bytes) 
         RTT is the end-to-end round trip time of the TCP connection (in  
         seconds) 
         p is the packet drop probability

   Neglecting the fact that the TCP rate linearly depends on it, 
   choosing the ideal packet size is a trade-off between high throughput 
   (the larger a packet, the smaller the relative header overhead) and 
   low delay (the smaller a packet, the shorter the time that is needed 
   until it is filled with data). Observing that TCP is not suited for 
   applications such as streaming media (since reliable in-order 
   delivery and congestion control can cause arbitrarily long delays), 
   this trade-off has not usually been considered for TCP applications, 
   and the influence of the packet size on the sending rate is not 
   typically seen as a significant issue. 
    
   The situation is different for the Datagram Congestion Control 
   Protocol (DCCP) [RFC4340], which has been designed to enable 
   unreliable but congestion-controlled datagram transmission, avoiding 
   the arbitrary delays associated with TCP. DCCP is intended for 
   applications such as streaming media that can benefit from control 
   over the tradeoffs between delay and reliable in-order delivery.   
    
   DCCP provides for a choice of modular congestion control mechanisms.  
   DCCP uses Congestion Control Identifiers (CCIDs) to specify the 
   congestion control mechanism. Three profiles are currently specified:  
   - DCCP Congestion Control ID 2 (CCID 2) [RFC4341]:  
     TCP-like Congestion Control. CCID 2 sends data using a close  
     variant of TCP's congestion control mechanisms, incorporating a  
     variant of SACK [RFC2018, RFC3517]. CCID 2 is suitable for senders  
     who can adapt to the abrupt changes in congestion window typical of  
     TCP's AIMD congestion control, and particularly useful for senders  
     who would like to take advantage of the available bandwidth in an  
     environment with rapidly changing conditions.   
   - DCCP Congestion Control ID 3 (CCID 3) [RFC4342]:  
     TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) [RFC3448bis] is a congestion  
     control mechanism designed for unicast flows operating in a best- 
     effort Internet environment. It is reasonably fair when competing  
     for bandwidth with TCP flows, but has a much lower variation of  
     throughput over time compared with TCP, making it more suitable for  
     applications such as streaming media where a relatively smooth  
     sending rate is of importance. CCID 3 is appropriate for flows that  
     would prefer to minimize abrupt changes in the sending rate,  
     including streaming media applications with small or moderate  
     receiver buffering before playback. 
   - DCCP Congestion Control ID 4 [draft-ietf-ccid4-02.txt]:  
     TFRC Small Packets (TFRC-SP) [RFC4828], a variant of TFRC  
     mechanism has been designed for applications that exchange small    
     packets. The objective of TFRC-SP is to achieve the same bandwidth       
     in bps (bits per second) as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500     
     bytes. TFRC-SP enforces a minimum interval of 10 ms between data    
     packets to prevent a single flow from sending small packets     
     arbitrarily frequently. TFRC is a congestion control mechanism for  
     unicast flows operating in a best-effort Internet environment, and    
 
 
Welzl & Papadimitriou   Expires February 2009               [Page 15]

     is designed for DCCP that controls the sending rate based on a    
     stochastic Markov model for TCP Reno. CCID 4 has been designed to  
     be used either by applications that use a small fixed segment size,  
     or by applications that change their sending rate by varying the  
     segment size. Because CCID 4 is intended for applications that use  
     a fixed small segment size, or that vary their segment size in  
     response to congestion, the transmit rate derived from the TCP  
     throughput equation is reduced by a factor that accounts for packet  
     header size, as specified in [RFC4828].   
    
   The resulting open questions are: 
   - How does TFRC-SP operate under various network conditions?  
   - How to design congestion control so as to scale with packet  
     size (dependency of congestion algorithm on packet size)? Early 
     assessment shows that packet size dependency should remain at 
     the transport layer. 
 
   Today, many network resources are designed so that packet processing 
   cannot be overloaded even for incoming loads at the maximum bit-rate 
   of the line. If packet processing can handle sustained load r [packet 
   per second] and the minimum packet size is h [bit] (i.e. packet 
   headers with no payload), then a line rate of x [bit per second] will 
   never be able to overload packet processing as long as x <= r.h. 
   However, realistic equipment is often designed to only cope with a 
   near-worst-case workload with a few larger packets in the mix, rather 
   than the worst-cast of all minimum size packets. In this case, x = 
   r.(h + e) for some small value of e.  
    
   Therefore, it is likely that most congestion seen on today's Internet 
   is due to an excess of bits rather than packets, although packet-
   congestion is not impossible for runs of small packets (e.g. TCP ACKs 
   or DoS attacks with small UDP datagrams).  
    
   This observation raises additional open issues: 
    
   - Will bit congestion remain prevalent? 
    
   Being able to assume that congestion is generally due to excess bits 
   not excess packets is a useful simplifying assumption in the design 
   of congestion control protocols. Can we rely on this assumption into 
   the future?  
    
   Over the last three decades, performance gains have mainly been 
   through increased packet rates, not bigger packets. But if bigger 
   maximum segment sizes become more prevalent, tiny segments (e.g. 
   ACKs) will still continue to be widely used - a widening range of 
   packet sizes.

   The open question is thus whether or not packet processing rates (r) 
   will keep up with growth in transmission rates (x). A superficial 
   look at Moore's Law type trends would suggest that processing (r) 
   will continue to outstrip growth in transmission (x). But predictions 
   based on actual knowledge of technology futures would be useful. 
   Another open question is whether there are likely to be more small 
   packets in the average packet mix. If the answers to either of these 
   questions predict that packet congestion could become prevalent, 
   congestion control protocols will have to be more complicated. 
    
   - Confusable Causes of Drop 
    
   There is a considerable body of research on how to distinguish 
   whether packet drops are due to transmission corruption or to 
   congestion. But the full list of confusable causes of drop is longer 
   and includes transmission loss, congestion loss (bit congestion and 
   packet congestion), and policing loss. 
    
   If congestion is due to excess bits, the bit rate should be reduced. 
   If congestion is due to excess packets, the packet rate can be 
   reduced without reducing the bit rate - by using larger packets. 
   However, if the transport cannot tell which of these causes led to a 
   specific drop, its only safe response is to reduce the bit rate. This 
   is why the Internet would be more complicated if packet congestion 
   were prevalent, as reducing the bit rate normally also reduces the 
   packet rate, while reducing the packet rate doesn't necessarily 
   reduce the bit rate. 
    
   Given distinguishing between transmission loss and congestion is 
   already an open issue (Section 3.2), if that problem is ever solved, 
   a further open issue would be whether to standardize a solution that 
   distinguishes all the above causes of drop, not just two of them.  
    
   Nonetheless, even if we find a way for network equipment to 
   explicitly distinguish which sort of drop has occurred, we will never 
   be able to assume that such a smart AQM solution is deployed at every 
   congestible resource throughout the Internet - at every higher layer 
   device like firewalls, proxies, servers and at every lower layer 
   device like low-end home hubs, DSLAMs, WLAN cards, cellular base-
   stations and so on. Thus, transport protocols will always have to 
   cope with drops due to unguessable causes, so we should always treat 
   AQM smarts as an optimization, not a given. 
    
   - What does a congestion notification on a packet of a certain size 
   mean?  
    
   The open issue here is whether a loss or explicit congestion mark 
   should be interpreted as a single congestion event irrespective of 
   the size of the packet lost or marked, or whether the strength of the 
 
 
Welzl & Papadimitriou   Expires February 2009                [Page 17] 

Open Research Issues in Internet Congestion Control        August 2008 
 
 
   congestion notification is weighted by the size of the packet. This 
   issue is discussed at length in [Bri08], along with other aspects of 
   packet size and congestion control.  
    
   [Bri08] makes the strong recommendation that network equipment should 
   drop or mark packets with a probability independent of each specific 
   packet's size, while congestion controls should respond to dropped or 
   marked packets in proportion to the packet's size. This issue is 
   deferred to the Transport Area Working Group. 
    
   - Packet Size and Congestion Control Protocol Design 
    
   If the above recommendation is correct - that the packet size of a 
   congestion notification should be taken into account when the 
   transport reads, not when the network writes the notification - it 
   opens up a significant program of protocol engineering and re-
   engineering. Indeed, TCP does not take packet size into account when 
   responding to losses or ECN. At present this is not a pressing 
   problem because use of 1500B data segments is very prevalent for TCP 
   and the range of alternative segment sizes is not large. However, we 
   should design the Internet's protocols so they will scale with packet 
   size, so an open issue is whether we should evolve TCP, or expect new 
   protocols to take over. 
    
   As we continue to standardize new congestion control protocols, we 
   must then face the issue of how they should take account of packet 
   size. If we determine that TCP was incorrect in not taking account of 
   packet size, even if we don't change TCP, we should not allow new 
   protocols to follow TCP's example in this respect. For example, as 
   explained here above, the small-packet variant of TCP-friendly rate 
   control (TFRC-SP [RFC4828]) is an experimental protocol that aims to 
   take account of packet size. Whatever packet size it uses, it ensures 
   its rate approximately equals that of a TCP using 1500B segments. 
   This raises the further question of whether TCP with 1500B segments 
   will be a suitable long-term gold standard, or whether we need a more 
   thoroughgoing review of what it means for a congestion control to 
   scale with packet size.  
    
3.4 Challenge 4: Pseudo-Wires 
    
   Pseudowires (PW) may carry non-TCP data flows (e.g. TDM traffic).  
   Structure Agnostic TDM over Packet (SATOP) [RFC4553], Circuit 
   Emulation over Packet Switched Networks (CESoPSN), TDM over IP, are 
   not responsive to congestion control in a TCP-friendly manner as 
   prescribed by [RFC2914]. Moreover, it is not possible to simply 
   reduce the flow rate of a TDM PW when facing packet loss.  
    
   Carrying TDM PW over an IP network poses a real problem. Indeed, 
   providers can rate control corresponding incoming traffic but it may

   not be able to detect that a PW carries TDM traffic. This can be 
   illustrated with the following example.

             .           .     .

   Sources S1, S2, S3 and S4 are originating TDM over IP traffic. P1 
   provider edges E1, E2, E3, and E4 are rate limiting such traffic. The 
   SLA of provider P1 with transit provider P2 is such that the latter 
   assumes a BE traffic pattern and that the distribution shows the 
   typical properties of common BE traffic (elastic, non-real time, non-
   interactive). 
    
   The problem arises for transit provider P2 that is not able to detect 
   that IP packets are carrying constant-bit rate service traffic that 
   is by definition unresponsive to any congestion control mechanisms.  
    
   Assuming P1 providers are rate limiting BE traffic, a transit P2 
   provider router R may be subject to serious congestion as all TDM PWs 
   cross the same router. TCP-friendly traffic would follow TCP's AIMD 
   algorithm of reducing the sending rate in half in response to each 
   packet drop. Nevertheless, the TDM PWs will take all the available 
   capacity, leaving no room for any other type of traffic. Note that 
   the situation may simply occur because S4 suddenly turns up a TDM PW.  
    
   As it is not possible to assume that edge routers will soon have the 
   ability to detect the type of the carried traffic, it is important 
   for transit routers (P2 provider) to be able to apply a fair, robust, 
   responsive and efficient congestion control technique in order to

   prevent impacting normally behaving Internet traffic. However, it is 
   still an open question how the corresponding mechanisms in the data 
   and control planes have to be designed. 
 
3.5 Challenge 5: Multi-domain Congestion Control 
    
   Transport protocols such as TCP operate over the Internet that is 
   divided into autonomous systems. These systems are characterized by 
   their heterogeneity as IP networks are realized by a multitude of 
   technologies. The variety of conditions and their variations leads to 
   correlation effects between policers that regulate traffic against 
   certain conformance criteria. 
    
   With the advent of techniques allowing for early detection of 
   congestion, packet loss is no longer the sole metric of congestion. 
   ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) marks packets - set by active 
   queue management techniques - to convey congestion information trying 
   to prevent packet losses (packet loss and the number of packets 
   marked gives an indication of the level of congestion). Using TCP 
   ACKs to feed back that information allows the hosts to realign their 
   transmission rate and thus encourage them to efficiently use the 
   network. In IP, ECN uses the two unused bits of the TOS field 
   [RFC2474]. Further, ECN in TCP uses two bits in the TCP header that 
   were previously defined as reserved [RFC793]. 
    
   ECN [RFC3168] is an example of a congestion feedback mechanism from 
   the network toward hosts, while the policer must sit at every 
   potential point of congestion. The congestion-based feedback scheme 
   however has limitations when applied on an inter-domain basis. 
   Indeed, the same congestion feedback mechanism is required along the 
   entire path for optimal control at end-systems. 
    
   Another solution in a multi-domain environment may be the TCP rate 
   controller (TRC), a traffic conditioner which regulates the TCP flow 
   at the ingress node in each domain by controlling packet drops and 
   RTT of the packets in a flow. The outgoing traffic from a TRC 
   controlled domain is shaped in such a way that no packets are dropped 
   at the policer. However, the TRC depends on the end-to-end TCP model, 
   and thus the diversity of TCP implementations is a general problem. 
    
   Security is another challenge for multi-domain operation. At some 
   domain boundaries, an increasing number of application layer gateways 
   (e. g., proxies) are deployed, which split up end-to-end connections 
   and prevent end-to-end congestion control.  
    
   Furthermore, authentication and authorization issues can arise at 
   domain boundaries whenever information is exchanged, and so far the 
   Internet does not have a single general security architecture that 
   could be used in all cases. Many autonomous systems also only

   exchange some limited amount of information about their internal 
   state (topology hiding principle), even though having more precise 
   information could be highly beneficial for congestion control. The 
   future evolution of the Internet inter-domain operation has to show 
   whether more multi-domain information exchange can be realized. 
 
3.6 Challenge 6: Precedence for Elastic Traffic 
    
   Traffic initiated by so-called elastic applications adapt to the 
   available bandwidth using feedback about the state of the network. 
   For all these flows the application dynamically adjusts the data 
   generation rate. Examples encompass short-lived elastic traffic 
   including HTTP and instant messaging traffic as well as long file 
   transfers with FTP. In brief, elastic data applications can show 
   extremely different requirements and traffic characteristics. 
    
   The idea to distinguish several classes of best-effort traffic types 
   is rather old, since it would be beneficial to address the relative 
   delay sensitivities of different elastic applications. The notion of 
   traffic precedence was already introduced in [RFC791], and it was 
   broadly defined as "An independent measure of the importance of this 
   datagram." 
    
   For instance, low precedence traffic should experience lower average 
   throughput than higher precedence traffic. Several questions arise 
   here: what is the meaning of "relative"? What is the role of the 
   Transport Layer? 
    
   The preferential treatment of higher precedence traffic with 
   appropriate congestion control mechanisms is still an open issue that 
   may, depending on the proposed solution, impact both the host and the 
   network precedence awareness, and thereby congestion control. 
   [RFC2990] points out that interactions between congestion control and 
   DiffServ [RFC2475] have yet to be addressed, and this statement is 
   still valid at the time of writing. 
    
   There is also still work to be performed regarding lower precedence 
   traffic - data transfers which are useful, yet not important enough 
   to significantly impair any other traffic. Examples of applications 
   that could make use of such traffic are web caches and web browsers 
   (e.g. for pre-fetching) as well as peer-to-peer applications. There 
   are proposals for achieving low precedence on a pure end-to-end basis 
   (e.g. TCP-LP [Kuzmanovic03]), and there is a specification for 
   achieving it via router mechanisms [RFC3662]. It seems, however, that 
   such traffic is still hardly used, and sending lower precedence data 
   is not yet a common service on the Internet.

3.7 Challenge 7: Misbehaving Senders and Receivers 
    
   In the current Internet architecture, congestion control depends on 
   parties acting against their own interests. It is not in a receiver's 
   interest to honestly return feedback about congestion on the path, 
   effectively requesting a slower transfer. It is not in the sender's 
   interest to reduce its rate in response to congestion if it can rely 
   on others to do so. Additionally, networks may have strategic reasons 
   to make other networks appear congested. 
    
   Numerous strategies to divert congestion control have already been 
   identified. The IETF has particularly focused on misbehaving TCP 
   receivers that could confuse a compliant sender into assigning 
   excessive network and/or server resources to that receiver (e.g. 
   [Sav99], [RFC3540]). But, although such strategies are worryingly 
   powerful, they do not yet seem common. 
    
   A growing proportion of Internet traffic comes from applications 
   designed not to use congestion control at all, or worse, applications 
   that add more forward error correction the more losses they 
   experience. Some believe the Internet was designed to allow such 
   freedom so it can hardly be called misbehavior. But others consider 
   that it is misbehavior to abuse this freedom [RFC3714], given one 
   person's freedom can constrain the freedom of others (congestion 
   represents this conflict of interests). Indeed, leaving freedom 
   unchecked might result in congestion collapse in parts of the 
   Internet. Proportionately, large volumes of unresponsive voice 
   traffic could represent such a threat, particularly for countries 
   with less generous provisioning [RFC3714]. More recently, Internet 
   video on demand services are becoming popular that transfer much 
   greater data rates without congestion control (e.g. the peer-to-peer 
   Joost service currently streams media over UDP at about 700kbps 
   downstream and 220kbps upstream). 
    
   Note that the problem is not just misbehavior driven by a selfish 
   desire for more bandwidth (see Section 4). 
    
   Open research questions resulting from these considerations are: 
    
   - By design, new congestion control protocols need to enable one end  
     to check the other for protocol compliance. 
   - Provide congestion control primitives that satisfy more demanding  
     applications (smoother than TFRC, faster than high speed TCPs), so  
     that application developers and users do not turn off congestion  
     control to get the rate they expect and need.  
    
   Note also that self-restraint is disappearing from the Internet. So, 
   it may no longer be sufficient to rely on developers/users 
   voluntarily submitting themselves to congestion control. As main

   consequence, mechanisms to enforce fairness (see Section 2.3) need to 
   have more emphasis within the research agenda. 
 
3.8 Other challenges 
    
   This section provides additional challenges and open research issues  
   that are not (at this point in time) deemed very large or of 
   different nature compared to the main challenges depicted since so 
   far.  
    
   Note that this section may be complemented in future release of this 
   document by topics discussed during the last ICCRG meeting, co-
   located with PFLDNet 2008 International Workshop. Topics of interest 
   include multipath congestion control, and congestion control for 
   multimedia codecs that only support certain set of data rates. 
    
3.8.1 RTT estimation 
    
   Several congestion control schemes have to precisely know the round-
   trip time (RTT) of a path. The RTT is a measure of the current delay 
   on a network. It is defined as the delay between the sending of a 
   packet and the reception of a corresponding response, which is echoed 
   back immediately by receiver upon receipt of the packet. This 
   corresponds to the sum of the one-way delay of the packet and the 
   (potentially different) one-way delay of the response. Furthermore, 
   any RTT measurement also includes some additional delay due to the 
   packet processing in both end-systems. 
    
   There are various techniques to measure the RTT: Active measurements 
   inject special probe packets to the network and then measure the 
   response time, using e.g. ICMP. In contrast, passive measurements 
   determine the RTT from ongoing communication processes, without 
   sending additional packets. 
    
   The connection endpoints of reliable transport protocols such as TCP, 
   SCTP, and DCCP, as well as several application protocols, keep track 
   of the RTT in order to dynamically adjust protocol parameters such as 
   the retransmission timeout (RTO). They can implicitly measure the RTT 
   on the sender side by observing the time difference between the 
   sending of data and the arrival of the corresponding 
   acknowledgements. For TCP, this is the default RTT measurement 
   procedure, in combination with Karn's algorithm that prohibits RTT 
   measurements from retransmitted segments [RFC2988]. Traditionally, 
   TCP implementations take one RTT measurement at a time (i. e., about 
   once per RTT). As alternative, the TCP timestamp option [RFC1323] 
   allows more frequent explicit measurements, since a sender can safely 
   obtain an RTT sample from every received acknowledgment. In 
   principle, similar measurement mechanisms are used by protocols other 
   than TCP.

Open Research Issues in Internet Congestion Control        August 2008 
 
 
    
   Sometimes it would be beneficial to know the RTT not only at the 
   sender, but also at the receiver. A passive receiver can deduce some 
   information about the RTT by analyzing the sequence numbers of 
   received segments. But this method is error-prone and only works if 
   the sender permanently sends data. Other network entities on the path 
   can apply similar heuristics in order to approximate the RTT of a 
   connection, but this mechanism is protocol-specific and requires per-
   connection state. In the current Internet, there is no simple and 
   safe solution to determine the RTT of a connection in network 
   entities other than the sender. 
    
   As outlined earlier in this document, the round-trip time is 
   typically not a constant value. For a given path, there is 
   theoretical minimum value, which is given by the minimum 
   transmission, processing and propagation delay on that path. However, 
   additional variable delays might be caused by congestion, cross-
   traffic, shared mediums access control schemes, recovery procedures, 
   or other sub-IP layer mechanisms. Furthermore, a change of the path 
   (e. g., route flipping, handover in mobile networks) can result in 
   completely different delay characteristics. 
    
   Due to this variability, one single measured RTT value is hardly 
   sufficient to characterize a path. This is why many protocols use RTT 
   estimators that derive an averaged value and keep track of a certain 
   history of previous samples. For instance, TCP endpoints derive a 
   smoothed round-trip time (SRTT) from an exponential weighted moving 
   average [RFC2988]. Such a low-pass filter ensures that measurement 
   noise and single outliers do not significantly affect the estimated 
   RTT. Still, a fundamental drawback of low-pass filters is that the 
   averaged value reacts slower to sudden changes of the measured RTT. 
   There are various solutions to overcome this effect: For instance, 
   the standard TCP retransmission timeout calculation considers not 
   only the SRTT, but also a measure for the variability of the RTT 
   measurements [RFC2988]. Since this algorithm is not well-suited for 
   frequent RTT measurements with timestamps, certain implementations 
   modify the weight factors (e.g., [SK02]). There are also proposals 
   for more sophisticated estimators, such as Kalman filters or 
   estimators that utilize mainly peak values. 
    
   However, open questions concerning RTT estimation in the Internet 
   remain: 
    
   - Optimal measurement frequency: Currently, there is no common  
     understanding of the right time scale of RTT measurement. In  
     particular, the necessity of rather frequent measurements    
     (e.g., per packet) is not well understood. There is some empirical  
     evidence that such frequent sampling may not have a significant  
     benefit [Allman99].

Open Research Issues in Internet Congestion Control        August 2008 
 
 
    
   - Filter design: A closely related question is how to design good  
     filters for the measured samples. The existing algorithms are known  
     to be robust, but they are far from being perfect. The fundamental  
     problem is that there is no single set of RTT values that could  
     characterize the Internet as a whole, i.e., it is hard to define a  
     design target. 
    
   - Default values: RTT estimators can fail in certain scenarios, e.  
     g., when any feedback is missing. In this case, default values have  
     to be used. Today, most default values are set to conservative  
     values that may not be optimal for most Internet communication.  
     Still, the impact of more aggressive settings is not well  
     understood. 
    
   - Clock granularities: RTT estimation depends on the clock  
     granularities of the protocol stacks. Even though there is a trend  
     towards higher precision timers, the limited granularity may still  
     prevent highly accurate RTT estimations. 
 
3.8.2 Malfunctioning devices 
    
   There is a long history of malfunctioning devices harming the 
   deployment of new and potentially beneficial functionality in the 
   Internet. Sometimes, such devices drop packets when a certain 
   mechanism is used, causing users to opt for reliability instead of 
   performance and disable the mechanism, or operating system vendors to 
   disable it by default. One well-known example is ECN, whose 
   deployment was long hindered by malfunctioning firewalls, but there 
   are many other examples (e.g. the Window Scaling option of TCP). 
    
   As new congestion control mechanisms are developed with the intention 
   of eventually seeing them deployed in the Internet, it would be 
   useful to collect information about failures caused by devices of 
   this sort, analyze the reasons for these failures, and determine 
   whether there are ways for such devices to do what they intend to do 
   without causing unintended failures. Recommendation for vendors of 
   these devices could be derived from such an analysis. It would also 
   be useful to see whether there are ways for failures caused by such 
   devices to become more visible to endpoints, or for those failures to 
   become more visible to the maintainers of such devices. 
 
4. Security Considerations  
    
   Misbehavior may be driven by pure malice, or malice may in turn be 
   driven by wider selfish interests, e.g. using distributed denial of 
   service (DDoS) attacks to gain rewards by extortion [RFC4948]. DDoS 
   attacks are possible both because of vulnerabilities in operating

Open Research Issues in Internet Congestion Control        August 2008 
 
 
   systems and because the Internet delivers packets without requiring 
   congestion control. 
    
   To date, compliance with congestion control rules and being fair 
   requires end points to cooperate. The possibility of uncooperative 
   behavior can be regarded as a security issue; its implications are 
   discussed throughout these documents in a scattered fashion. 
    
   Currently the focus of the research agenda against denial of service 
   is about identifying attack packets, attacking machines and networks 
   hosting them, with a particular focus on mitigating source address 
   spoofing. But if mechanisms to enforce congestion control fairness 
   were robust to both selfishness and malice [Bri06] they would also 
   naturally mitigate denial of service, which can be considered (from 
   the perspective of well-behaving Internet user) as a congestion 
   control enforcement problem.
