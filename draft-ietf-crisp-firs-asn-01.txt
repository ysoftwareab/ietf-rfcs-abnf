  1.      Introduction 
      
     This specification defines the naming syntax, object classes, 
     attributes, matching filters, and query processing rules for 
     storing and locating Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) in the FIRS 
     service. Refer to [FIRS-ARCH] for information on the FIRS 
     architecture and [FIRS-CORE] for the schema definitions and rules 
     which govern the FIRS service as a whole. 
      
     The definitions in this specification are intended to be used with 
     FIRS. Their usage outside of FIRS is not prohibited, but any such 
     usage is beyond this specification's scope of authority. 
      
  2.      Prerequisites and Terminology 
      
     The complete set of specifications in the FIRS collection 
     cumulative define a structured and distributed information service 
     using LDAPv3 for the data-formatting and transport functions. This 
     specification should be read in the context of the complete set of 
     specifications, which currently include the following:

     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
     in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 
      
  3.      Naming Syntax 
      
     The naming syntax for ASN entries in FIRS MUST follow the form of 
     "cn=<inetAsNumberSyntax>,cn=inetResources,<partition>", where 
     <inetAsNumberSyntax> is the Autonomous System Number resource, and 
     where <partition> is a sequence of domainComponent relative 
     distinguished names which identifies the scope of authority for 
     the selected directory partition. 
      
     Entries which use the inetAsNumberSyntax rules use the decimal 
     equivalent of a 16-bit autonomous system number, with the non-
     affective leading zeroes removed. 
      
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003             [page 3] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-firs-asn-01.txt          May 2003 
   
   
      
     An augmented BNF for this syntax is as follows: 
      
          inetAsNumberSyntax = decimal value between "0" and "65535" 
             inclusive, with the non-affective leading zeroes removed 
      
     The schema definition for inetAsNumberSyntax is as follows: 
      
          inetAsNumberSyntax 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.4.1 NAME 'inetAsNumberSyntax' DESC 'An 
             autonomous system number.' ) 
      
     For example, an entry for ASN "1" in the "dc=arin,dc=net" 
     partition would be "cn=1,cn=inetResources,dc=arin,dc=net", while 
     an entry for AS number "65535" in the same partition would be 
     "cn=65535,cn=inetResources,dc=arin,dc=net". 
      
  4.      Object Classes and Attributes 
      
     ASN-specific entries in FIRS MUST use the inetAsNumber object 
     class, in addition to the mandatory object classes defined in 
     [FIRS-CORE]. ASN entries MUST be treated as containers capable of 
     holding subordinate entries. If an entry exists as a referral 
     source, the entry MUST also be defined with the referral object 
     class, in addition to the above requirements. 
      
     The inetAsNumber object class is a structural object class which 
     is subordinate to the inetResources object class. The inetAsNumber 
     object class has no mandatory attributes, although it does have 
     several optional attributes. The inetAsNumber object class also 
     inherits the attributes defined in the inetResources object class, 
     including the "cn" naming attribute. 
      
     The schema definition for the inetAsNumber object class is as 
     follows: 
      
          inetAsNumber 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.4.0 NAME 'inetAsNumber' DESC 'Autonomous 
             system attributes.' SUP inetResources STRUCTURAL MAY ( 
             inetAsnDelegationStatus $ inetAsnDelegationDate $ 
             inetAsnRegistrar $ inetAsnRegistry $ inetAsnContacts $ 
             inetAsnRoutingContacts ) )

     The attributes from the inetAsNumber object class are described 
     below: 
      
          inetAsnContacts 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.4.2 NAME 'inetAsnContacts' DESC 
             'Contacts for general administrative issues concerning 
             this ASN.' EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch SYNTAX 
             inetContactSyntax ) 
      
          inetAsnDelegationDate 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.4.3 NAME 'inetAsnDelegationDate' DESC 
             'Date this ASN was delegated.' EQUALITY 
             generalizedTimeMatch ORDERING generalizedTimeOrderingMatch 
             SYNTAX generalizedTime SINGLE-VALUE ) 
      
          inetAsnDelegationStatus 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.4.4 NAME 'inetAsnDelegationStatus' DESC 
             'Delegation status for this AS number.' EQUALITY 
             numericStringMatch SYNTAX numericString{2} SINGLE-VALUE ) 
      
            NOTE: In an effort to facilitate internationalization and 
            programmatic processing, the current status of a delegation 
            is identified by a 16-bit integer. The values and status 
            mapping is as follows: 
      
                 0   Reserved delegation (permanently inactive) 
                 1   Assigned and active (normal state) 
                 2   Assigned but not yet active (new delegation) 
                 3   Assigned but on hold (disputed) 
                 4   Assignment revoked (database purge pending) 
      
            Additional values are reserved for future use, and are to 
            be administered by IANA. 
      
            Note that there is no status code for "unassigned"; 
            unassigned entries SHOULD NOT exist, and SHOULD NOT be 
            returned as answers.  
      
          inetAsnRegistrar 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.4.5 NAME 'inetAsnRegistrar' DESC 
             'Registrar who delegated this ASN.' EQUALITY 
             caseIgnoreMatch SYNTAX directoryString ) 
      
            NOTE: The inetAsnRegistrar attribute uses a URL to indicate 
            the registrar who delegated the ASN. The attribute

            structure is identical to the labeledURI attribute, as 
            defined in [RFC2798], including the URL and textual 
            comments. The data can refer to any valid URL. 
      
          inetAsnRegistry

             'Registry where this ASN is managed.' EQUALITY 
             caseIgnoreMatch SYNTAX directoryString ) 
      
            NOTE: The inetAsnRegistry attribute uses a URL to indicate 
            the registry who is ultimately responsible for the ASN. The 
            attribute structure is identical to the labeledURI 
            attribute, as defined in [RFC2798], including the URL and 
            textual comments. The data can refer to any valid URL. 
      
          inetAsnRoutingContacts 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.4.7 NAME 'inetAsnRoutingContacts' DESC

  5.      Query Processing Rules 
      
     Queries for ASNs have several special requirements, as discussed 
     in the following sections. 
      
     Refer to [FIRS-CORE] for general information about FIRS queries. 
      
  5.1.    Query Pre-Processing 
      
     Clients MUST ensure that the query input is normalized according 
     to the rules specified in section 3 before the input is used as 
     the assertion value to the resulting LDAP query. 
      
     There are no pre-existing mechanisms for mapping ASNs to domain 
     names. As such, there are no pre-existing mechanisms for mapping 
     ASNs to authoritative LDAP partitions. In order to facilitate 
     interoperability, FIRS queries for ASN resources MUST use 
     "dc=arpa" as the authoritative partition, and MUST use 
     "cn=inetResources,dc=arpa" for the search base. It is expected 
     that FIRS-compliant LDAP servers will be established to serve this 
     directory partition, with these servers providing entry-specific 
     referrals to registrar-specific servers. 
      
  5.2.    Query Bootstrapping 
      
     FIRS clients MUST use the top-down bootstrap model by default for 
     ASN queries. 
      
     FIRS clients MAY use the targeted bootstrap model for queries if 
     necessary or desirable. 
      
     Due to the lack of any public DNS delegation mapping service, 
     there is no practical reason for FIRS clients to use the bottom-up 
     model with ASN queries. 
      
  5.3.    LDAP Matching 
      
     FIRS clients MUST specify equalityMatch matching filters in LDAP 
     searches for ASN entries. 
      
     In order to ensure that all of the relevant entries are found 
     (including any referrals), the search filters for these resources 
     MUST specify the inetAsNumber object class and the naming element 
     of the resource as a distinguished name attribute. For example, 
     "(&(objectclass=inetAsNumber)(cn:dn:65535))" with a search base of 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003             [page 7] 
  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-firs-asn-01.txt          May 2003 
   
   
     "cn=inetResources,dc=arin,dc=net" would find all of the 
     inetAsNumber object class entries with a relative distinguished 
     name of "cn=65535" in the "dc=arin,dc=net" partition. 
      
     The matching filters defined in this specification MUST be 
     supported by FIRS clients and servers. FIRS servers MAY support 
     additional sub-string filters, soundex filters, or any other 
     filters they wish (these may be required to support generic LDAP 
     clients), although FIRS clients MUST NOT expect any additional 
     filters to be available. 
      
  5.4.    Example Query 
      
     The following example assumes that the user has specified "65535" 
     as the query value: 
      
        a.  Normalize the input, which is "65535" in this case. 
      
        b.  Determine the authoritative partition, which is always 
            "dc=arpa" in the case of ASNs. 
      
        c.  Determine the search base for the query, which is always 
            "cn=inetResources,dc=arpa" in the case of ASNs. 
      
        d.  Initiate a DNS lookup for the SRV resource records 
            associated with "_ldap._tcp.arpa." For the purpose of this 
            example, assume that this lookup succeeds, with the DNS 
            response message indicating that "firs.iana.org" is the 
            preferred LDAP server. 
      
        e.  Submit an LDAPv3 query to the specified server, using 
            "(&(objectclass=inetAsNumber)(cn:dn:65535))" as the 
            matching filter, "cn=inetResources,dc=arpa" as the search 
            base, and the global query defaults defined in [FIRS-CORE]. 
      
        f.  Assume that the queried server returns a continuation 
            reference referral which points to 
            "ldap:///cn=inetResources,dc=arin,dc=net". The 
            distinguished name element of 
            "cn=inetResources,dc=arin,dc=net" will be used as the new 
            search base, while "dc=arin,dc=net" will be used as the new 
            authoritative partition. 
      
        g.  Initiate a DNS lookup for the SRV resource records 
            associated with "_ldap._tcp.arin.net." For the purpose of 
            this example, assume that this lookup succeeds, with the

  Internet Draft     draft-ietf-crisp-firs-asn-01.txt          May 2003 
   
   
            DNS response message indicating that "firs.arin.net" is the 
            preferred LDAP server. 
      
        h.  Submit an LDAPv3 query to the specified server, using 
            "(&(objectclass=inetAsNumber)(cn:dn:65535))" as the 
            matching filter, "cn=inetResources,dc=arin,dc=net" as the 
            search base, and the global query defaults defined in 
            [FIRS-CORE]. 
      
        i.  Assume that no other referrals are received. Display the 
            answer data which has been received and exit the query. 
      
  6.      Security Considerations 
      
     Security considerations are discussed in [FIRS-ARCH]. 
      
  7.      IANA Considerations 
      
     ASNs are not currently represented in the global DNS, and there 
     are no standardized mechanisms for mapping ASNs to authoritative 
     partitions using the public DNS. This specification uses the 
     "arpa" zone for this mapping function with the expectation that 
     FIRS-capable LDAP servers will be established, and that 
     authoritative partitions will be mapped to that zone, with this 
     partition containing ASN-specific entries which will provide 
     referrals to the appropriate registrar's partitions. It is further 
     expected that IANA will oversee the creation and management of the 
     ARPA domain's LDAP SRV resource records, the "dc=arpa" LDAP 
     partition, and the necessary LDAP servers. 
      
     The inetAsnDelegationStatus attribute uses numeric code values. It 
     is expected that IANA will manage the assignment of these values. 
      
     Additional IANA considerations are discussed in [FIRS-ARCH].

     Funding for the RFC editor function is currently provided by the 
     Internet Society. 
      
     Portions of this document were funded by Verisign Labs. 
      
     The first version of this specification was co-authored by Andrew 
     Newton of Verisign Labs, and subsequent versions continue to be 
     developed with his active participation. 
      
  11.     Changes from Previous Versions 
      
     draft-ietf-crisp-firs-asn-01: 
      
        *   Several clarifications and corrections have been made. 
      
     draft-ietf-crisp-firs-asn-00: 
      
        *   Restructured the document set. 
      
        *   "Attribute references" have been eliminated from the 
            specification. All referential attributes now provide 
            actual data instead of URL pointers to data. Clients that 
            wish to retrieve these values will need to start new 
            queries using the data values instead of URLs. 
      
        *   The attribute-specific operational attributes have been 
            eliminated as unnecessary. 
      
        *   The inetAsnRegistrar and inetAsnRegistry attributes were 
            added. 
      
        *   Several attributes had their OIDs changed. NOTE THAT THIS 
            IS AN INTERNET DRAFT, AND THAT THE OIDS ARE SUBJECT TO 
            ADDITIONAL CHANGES AS THIS DOCUMENT IS EDITED. 
      
        *   Several typographical errors have been fixed. 
      
        *   Some unnecessary text has been removed.
