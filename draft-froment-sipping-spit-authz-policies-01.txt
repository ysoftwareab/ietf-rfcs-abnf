Abstract

   SPAM, defined as sending unsolicited messages to someone in bulk,
   might be a problem on SIP open-wide deployed networks.  The
   responsibility for filtering or blocking calls can belong to
   different elements in the call flow and may depend on various
   factors.  This document discusses mechanisms to establish policies to

   react on potentially unwanted communication attempts.

   These policies match a particular Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   communication pattern based on a number of attributes.  The range of
   attributes includes information provided, for example, by the SIP
   itself, by the SIP identity mechanism, by information carried within
   SAML assertions (as introduced with SIP-SAML) and by the SPIT-SAML
   extensions.

   This document raises the question whether it is worth to investigate
   the aspect of authorization policy usage for SPIT prevention.  If so,
   then the choice of a policy language for describing authorization
   policies and the details of the authorization policies becomes
   important.  Mechanisms to create, modify and delete authorization
   policies that are stored in XML documents are already available with
   XCAP and WEBDAV and can be reused.

Internet-Draft             Anti-SPIT Policies                  June 2006


1.  Introduction

   The problem of SPAM for VoIP seems to become a very big challenge and
   only "the combination of several techniques can provide a framework
   for dealing with spam in SIP" (as stated in [I-D.jennings-sip-
   hashcash]).

   One important building block is to have a mechanism to offer a
   mechanism to instruct some entities in the network to "filter"
   incoming requests according to user or to network-wide policies.
   Different entities, such as users or system administrators, might
   create and modify authorization policies and might even share these
   policies between domains.

   Some attributes in a SIP communication play a more important role
   than others.  For example, there is reason to believe that applying
   authorization policies based on the authenticated identity is an
   effective way to accept a communication attempt in order to compat
   SPIT.  The same is true for policies that are applied to deployment
   friendlier SIP security solutions, such as the SIP identity mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-sip-identity].

   Figure 1: Framework and Scenario

   Authorization policies can be applied at the end host and/or by
   intermediaries.  The rule maker might be an end user that owns the
   device, a VoIP service provider, a person with a relationship to the
   end user (e.g., the parents of a child using a mobile phone).  When
   the creation, modification and deletion of authorization policies is
   not only a local matter then a standardized policy language is
   needed.

   The subsequent text lists a few use cases.

   The first use case that can be imagined is the case of a user that

   asks its outbound proxy to offer protection of requests from a
   particular SIP UA.  He can create an authorization policy rule and
   upload it to the SIP proxy within its own domain.  Requests coming
   from this SIP URI will then be blocked or treated differently.

   Supposing "B@otherdomain.com" has added an authorization rule
   blocking request coming from domain example.com.  Here is a potential
   message sequence:


   @example.com       Proxy          Proxy      B@otherdomain.com
                  @example.com @otherdomain.com
    |                 |               |                |
    |                 |               |   Reject       |
    |                 |               |   @example.com |
    |                 |               |<---------------|
    |                 |               |   OK           |
    |                 |               |--------------->|
    |                 |               |                |
    | INVITE          |               |                |
    | B@otherdomain.com               |                |
    |---------------->|               |                |
    |                 | INVITE        |                |
    |                 | B@otherdomain.com              |
    |                 |-------------->|                |
    |                 | 403 Forbidden |                |
    |                 |<--------------|                |
    | 403 Forbidden   |               |                |
    |<----------------|               |                |

   If a solution has to be provided to enable SPIT filtering then the
   following two sub-problems have to be solved:

   o  A authorization policy language that allows to expression the
      conditions and actions.  An example is [I-D.ietf-simple-presence-
      rules].

   o  A mechanism to create, delete, update, retrieve and upload XML
      based authorization policy rules.  XCAP [I-D.ietf-simple-xcap] is
      a reasonable solution.  Another one is WEBDAV [I-D.ietf-webdav-
      rfc2518bis].

4.  Requirements

   The design of anti-SPIT authorization policies is guided by the
   following requirements.

   1.  The policies SHOULD allow filtering incoming requests depending
       on several criteria's:

       *  Value of any SIP header attribute (e.g., From, To, Contact)

       *  Method invoked by the caller (e.g., INVITE, MESSAGE)

       *  Value of parameters specified in [I-D.schwartz-sipping-spit-
          saml]

          +  IdentityStrength

          +  CostOfCall

          +  AuthenticationMethod

          +  IdentityAssertion

          +  ConnectionSecurity

          +  SPITSuspected

          +  CallCenter

          +  AssertionStrength

       *  Request URI of a request

       *  Presence of a given expression in the body (subject for
          further investigation)

   2.  The policies SHOULD support wildcards (e.g., entire domains)

   3.  The policies SHOULD support logical operations (and, or, not)
       between individual elements in conditions

   4.  The policies SHOULD refer to all authenticated and
       unauthenticated identities.

   5.  The policies SHOULD allow a number of actions to be specified,
       such as:

Internet-Draft             Anti-SPIT Policies                  June 2006


       *  "block": stop forwarding the request and answer with a ``403
          Forbidden''

       *  "polite-block": drop the request without answering anything

       *  "mark": forward the request, putting a flag ``SPAM''

       *  "allow": forward this message without conditions (this
          mechanism is described further)

       *  and trigger other mechanism, such as:

          +  "puzzle": trigger the "Computational Puzzles"
             [I-D.jennings-sip-hashcash] mechanism.

          +  "consent": trigger the "Consent Framework" [I-D.rosenberg-
             sipping-consent-framework] mechanism

   6.  The policies SHOULD allow a default action to be specified.

   7.  It SHOULD be possible to allow a hierarchy of authorization
       policies to be used.

5.  Discussion and Open Issues

5.1.  Extending Geopriv Authorization Policies

   The work done in the Geopriv working group on authorization policies
   seem to be a promising candate for these authorization policies.

   To fulfill requirements (1) to (6), it is necessary to decide if
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-common-policy] and [I-D.ietf-simple-presence-rules]
   can be extended.

   The following open issues have been identified:

   o  The authorization policies defined by the Geopriv working group
      focus on a whitelist approach.  This document also raises the
      question to what extend backlisting capability can be supported or
      is necessary to support.

   o  The Geopriv Common Policy mechanism does not allow generic "deny"
      actions to be defined.  This aspect refers to requirements (4)
      ("all") where (although "all except one" is supported by Common
      Policy).

   o  Requirement 2 (wildcards) is provided by Common Policy in a
      limited fashion by referring to the domain part of an identity.
      Regular expressions are not supported to keep the policy language
      simple.

5.2.  Hierarchical Authorization Policy Documents

   Requirement (7) might require a conflict resolution mechanism to be
   specified.  Geopriv Common Policy currently defines a very simple but
   powerful conflict resolution mechanism but it is for further
   investigation whether it is applicable to this problem domain.  Other
   policy languages define a more sophisticated set of conflict
   resolution mechanisms with preceedence and weights for policies.
   Although this might be an obviously solution for usage in the context
   of hierarchical authorization policies it causes problems in other
   places (such as preserving the order of rules).

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require actions by IANA.

Internet-Draft             Anti-SPIT Policies                  June 2006


7.  Security Considerations

   The security concerns are related to the ability of certain entities
   to create, update and delete authorization policies.  If an
   unauthorized entity is allowed to modify policies (and to distribute
   them to other domains) then a denial of service attack is the
   consequence with impact for more than a single end point.

   Furthermore, SPIT prevention techniques often cross the border of
   what is legally acceptable in certain countries (e.g., filtering SPIT
   without the consent of the user).  Hence, it is extremely important
   to consider privacy laws in this work.

Appendix A.  Sophisticated SPIT Filtering Scenario

   In a more sophisticated scenario one might even consider the idea of
   stopping SPIT as early as possible.  Domains may agree to exchange
   authorization policies in order to stop SPIT earlier (i.e., closer to
   the source of the problem).  The subsequent text describes this
   scenario.


             A@example.com       Proxy          Proxy      B@otherdomain.com
                                @example.com  @otherdomain.com
                |                 |               |                |
                | INVITE          |               |                |
                | B@otherdomain.com               |                |
                |---------------->|               |                |
                | 403 Forbidden   |               |                |
                |<----------------|               |                |

   This call flow illustrates the bandwidth-saving interest of this use
   case.

   Though, two scenarios could happen:

   o  In the good case, the sender's domain is honest and exchanges
      authorization policies in order to apply rules that avoids
      forwarding unsollicited requests.

   o  In the worst case, the sender's domain is not cooperative.  It
      will refuse to upload such documents.  In this case, the presence
      of rules in the recipient's domain will suffice to keep the
      recipient "SPAM free", even if more traffic has been consumed
      (since the request has been relayed at least until the first proxy
      of the recipient's domain, exactly like in the first use case).

   It might be desirable to use a hierarchy of authorization policy
   documents that need to be combined when applying them to the SIP
   signaling traffic.  This raises the question of a merging algorithm,
   particularly when authorization policy rules are conflicting or
   contain blacklists.

   This scenario is subject for further discussion since it might raise
   privacy concerns when privacy policies are shared and potentially
   applied to other communication partners traffic.
