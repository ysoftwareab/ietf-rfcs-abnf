1.  Introduction

   Service function is responsible for specific treatment of received
   packets, while service function chain is directing the traffic
   through a series of service functions in Data Centers or across the
   Data Centers.  Due to the virtualized network, service function chain
   can be centrally controlled with servicing traffic on the same
   network or across the different networks.  With the service function
   chaining, Network as a service can be provided by Internet Service
   Providers (ISPs) in order to meet the different requirements from
   diversified tenants.  Layer 4- Layer 7 value-added services (VAS) are
   provided.  Tenants buy service functions through the logical network
   applications with logical network mapping to the physical network
   technically.

   This document describes a extended architecture of Service Function
   Chaining (SFC) to provide the L4-L7 services.  The basic architecture
   includes the applications to tenants, SDN controller, network
   function virtualized manager (NFVM) and the service function node.
   With the orchestration, the SDN controller and the NFV manager work
   in coordination to provide the auto-deployed service such as load
   balancing the traffic originating from the remote side to the Data
   Centers or inner Data Centers, doing the network address translation
   (NAT), and the firewalls with policies focusing on the threats.
   Besides the architecture, fundamental configurations and the
   realizations of the service function chaining are introduced with
   requirements raised.  Benefitting from the Network function
   virtualization (NFV) and cloud technologies, SFC in virtual networks
   can bring convenient and elastic network to the customers with
   central management to the operators.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Fundamental service function chaining architecture

   The service function chaining includes the service chain applications
   faced to tenants, the orchestrations platform, SDN controller, NFV
   manager and the network elements.

   Service chain applications (APP):

   Service chain applications are programs to the tenants which record
   their network requirements and translate them to the SDN controller
   and the NFV managers.

   Orchestrator:

   The orchestrator is in charge of the orchestration and management of
   NFV infrastructure and software resources, and realizing network
   services.

   SDN Controller:

   The SDN controller is a logically centralized entity with a general
   view of the network and in charge of SDN datapaths according to the
   requirements from the service chain applications.

   NFV Manager:

   The NFV manager is responsible for NFV lifecycle management such as
   installation, update, query, scaling and termination.

   Network elements:

   Network elements are the resource instances which can be a virtual
   instance or be embedded in a physical network element such as the
   virtual load balance instances or the physical firewall located in
   the resource pool.

   The basic operations of the service function chain include:

   (a) The installation, update, query, scaling and termination of
   virtual load balancer.

   (b) The installation, update, query, scaling and termination of
   virtual firewall.

   (c) The installation, update, query, scaling and termination of VPN
   gateway.

   (d) The installation, update, query, scaling and termination of the
   Intrusion Detection system (IDS) and the Intrusion Prevention system
   (IPS).

   It is not the purpose of this document to be exhaustive of all the
   service function chain, but instead, we try to make it clearer for
   the deployment and realization of SFC.

4.  Service function chaining use cases

   Layer 4 -Lay 7 value-added services which the SFCs support are
   necessities.  In the Data Center scenario, SFC should be configured
   with the service profile according to the network status and user
   attribute.  Customers can choose the suitable SFC as required, thus
   providing a elastic, agile and convenient service with deployment
   cost reducing and consumption of resources increasing.

5.  Service function chaining realization

   Tenants configure the SFC they required by service chain application.
   The configurations are translated by the centralized network
   management part such as the plugin of FWaaS or LBaaS in the Openstack
   Neutron.  The network management center interacts with SDN controller
   or the management of virtual network functions (VNFs).  Different
   tenants can define their own configurations of the VNF policies.  In
   the VPC service, the configurations are recorded in the service
   profiles which direct the traffic in the right way.  After receiving
   the service profile of SFC, SDN controller sends the responding flow
   table to the network elements and makes the comprehensively decision
   after the message report bottom up received.

   Actually, in the openstack neutron, the functions of FWaaS, LBaaS and
   VPNaaS are limited to the basic functions such as creating, updating,
   querying and deleting a VAS.  The overall management of the FW or LB
   are operated by the FW or LB manager.  Thus the SDN controller and
   the VNF manager cooperate in order to provide prefect interaction
   with the service chain application.  The operations of create,
   update, query, delete are provided by the neutron, while the other
   functions are provided by the VNF managers, such as source NAT, x-
   forward-for in the http header, scalability, high availability and so
   on.

6.  Conclusion

   Such an extended architecture in service function chain provided
   takes advantage of the orchestration of SDN controller and the NFV
   manager.  Thus convenient and elastic network are provided to the
   customers with central management to the operators.  Details about
   the architecture such as the respective responsibility of SDN
   controller and NFVM, the traffic directing and interactive process
   between different network elements need to be further studied.
