      1. Introduction 

         The IANA registration of media subtype types in the IETF tree 
         created two similar media subtypes "scip" under the audio and 
         video media types [AUDIOSCIP], [VIDEOSCIP].  This document, as 
         the common top-level reference, provides information on their 
         similarities and differences and the usage of those media 
         subtypes.  

         This document details usage of the scip pseudo-codec as a 
         secure session establishment protocol and transport protocol 
         over RTP. It provides a reference for network security 
         policymakers, network equipment OEMs, procurement personnel, 
         and government agency and commercial industry representatives.

      2. Background 

         The Secure Communication Interoperability Protocol (SCIP) 
         allows the negotiation of several voice, data, and video 
         applications using various encryption suites.  SCIP also 
         provides several important characteristics that have led to its 
         broad acceptance in the international user community.  These 
         features include end-to-end security at the application layer, 
         authentication of user identity, the ability to apply different 
         security levels for each secure session, and secure 
         communication over any end-to-end data connection. 

         SCIP began in the U.S. as the FNBDT (Future Narrowband Digital 
         Terminal) Protocol.  A combined Department of Defense and 
         vendor consortium formed a governing organization named the 
         ICWG (Interoperability Control Working Group).  In time, the 
         group expanded to include NATO, NATO partners and European 
         vendors under the name IICWG (International Interoperability 
         Control Working Group), which was later renamed the SCIP 
         Working Group.   

         SCIP is presently implemented in U.S. and NATO secure voice, 
         video, and data products operating on commercial, private, and 
         tactical IP networks worldwide using the scip media subtype.  
         First generation SCIP devices operated on circuit-switched

      Internet-Draft  RTP Payload Format for the SCIP Codec August 2021 
          

         networks.  SCIP was then expanded to radio and IP networks.  
         The scip media subtype transports SCIP secure session 
         establishment signaling and secure application traffic.  The 
         built-in negotiation and flexibility provided by the SCIP 
         standards make it a natural choice for many scenarios that 
         require various secure applications and associated encryption 
         suites.  SCIP has been endorsed by many nations as the secure 
         end-to-end solution for secure voice, video, and data devices.  
         SCIP standards are currently available to participating 
         government/military communities and select OEMs of equipment 
         that support SCIP. 

         However, SCIP must operate over global networks (including 
         private and commercial networks).  Without access to necessary 
         information to support SCIP, some networks may not support the 
         SCIP media subtypes. Issues may occur simply because 
         information is not as readily available to OEMs, network 
         administrators, and network architects.   

         This RFC provides essential information about audio/scip and 
         video/scip media subtypes that enables network equipment 
         manufacturers to include scip as a known audio and video media 
         subtype in their equipment and enables network administrators 
         to define and implement a compatible security policy. 

         All current IP-based SCIP devices support "scip" as a media 
         subtype. Registration of scip as a media subtype provides a 
         common reference for network equipment manufacturers to 
         recognize SCIP in a payload declaration.   

      3. Media Format Description 

         The "scip" media subtype indicates support for and identifies 
         SCIP traffic that is being transferred using RTP.  SCIP traffic 
         requires end-to-end bit integrity, therefore transcoding SHALL 
         NOT be performed over the end-to-end IP connection.  The 
         audio/scip and video/scip media subtype data streams within the 
         network, including the VoIP network, MUST be a transparent 
         relay and be treated as "clear-channel data", similar to the 
         Clearmode media subtype defined by RFC 4040.  However, 
         Clearmode is defined as a gateway protocol and limited to a 
         sample rate of 8000 Hz and 64kbps bandwidth only [RFC4040].  
         Clearmode is not defined for the higher sample and data rates 
         required for some SCIP traffic.

      Internet-Draft  RTP Payload Format for the SCIP Codec August 2021 
          

      4. Payload Format 

         The RTP Packet content of SCIP traffic is dependent upon the 
         SCIP session state.  SCIP secure session establishment uses 
         protocols defined in SCIP-210 [SCIP210] to negotiate an 
         application.  SCIP secure traffic may consist of the encrypted 
         output of codecs such as MELPe [RFC8130], G.729D [RFC3551], 
         H.264 [RFC6184], or other media encodings, based on the 
         application negotiated during SCIP secure session 
         establishment.  SCIP traffic is highly variable and may include 
         other SCIP signaling information in the media stream.  SCIP 
         traffic may not always be a continuous stream at the bit rate 
         specified in the SDP [RFC8866] since discontinuous transmission 
         (DTX) or other mechanisms may be used.  The SCIP payload size 
         will vary, especially during SCIP secure session establishment. 

      4.1. RTP Header Fields 

         The RTP header fields SHOULD conform to RFC 3550.  This is a 
         SHOULD rather than a SHALL in recognition that legacy SCIP-
         enabled products may not strictly adhere to RFC 3550. 

         SCIP traffic may be continuous or discontinuous.  The Timestamp 
         field increments based on the sampling clock for discontinuous 
         transmission as described in [RFC3550], Section 5.1.  The 
         Timestamp field for continuous transmission applications is 
         dependent on the sampling rate of the media as specified in the 
         media subtype's specification (e.g., MELPe [RFC8130]).  Note 
         that during a call, both discontinuous and continuous traffic 
         is highly probable.  Therefore, a jitter buffer MAY be 
         implemented in endpoint devices only but SHOULD NOT be 
         implemented in network devices. 

         The Marker bit SHOULD be set to zero for discontinuous traffic.  
         The Marker bit for continuous traffic is based on the 
         underlying media subtype specification.  This specification is 
         a SHOULD rather than a SHALL in recognition that legacy SCIP-
         enabled products may not strictly adhere to the media subtype 
         specification. 

      5. Payload Format Parameters 

         The SCIP RTP payload format is identified using the scip media 
         subtype, which is registered in accordance with [RFC4855] and 
         per the media type registration template form [RFC6838].  A 
         clock rate of 8000 Hz SHALL be used for "audio/scip".  A clock 
         rate of 90000 Hz SHALL be used for "video/scip".

      5.3. Mapping to SDP 

         The mapping of the above defined payload format media subtype 
         and its parameters SHALL be done according to Section 3 of 
         [RFC4855]. 

         An example mapping for audio/scip is: 

            m=audio 50000 RTP/AVP 96 
            a=rtpmap:96 scip/8000 

         An example mapping for video/scip is: 

            m=video 50002 RTP/AVP 97 
            a=rtpmap:97 scip/90000 

         An example mapping for both audio/scip and video/scip is: 

            m=audio 50000 RTP/AVP 96 
            a=rtpmap:96 scip/8000 
            m=video 50002 RTP/AVP 97 
            a=rtpmap:97 scip/90000 

         The application negotiation between endpoints will determine 
         whether the audio and video streams are transported as separate

         streams over the audio and video payload types or as a single 
         media stream on the video payload type. 

      5.4. SDP Offer/Answer Considerations 

         In accordance with the SDP Offer/Answer model [RFC3264], the 
         SCIP device SHALL list the SCIP payload type in order of 
         preference in the "m" media line.  

      6. Security Considerations 

         RTP packets using the payload format defined in this 
         specification are subject to the security considerations 
         discussed in the RTP specification [RFC3550], and in any 
         applicable RTP profile such as RTP/AVP [RFC3551], RTP/AVPF 
         [RFC4585], RTP/SAVP [RFC3711], or RTP/ SAVPF [RFC5124].  
         However, as "Securing the RTP Protocol Framework: Why RTP Does 
         Not Mandate a Single Media Security Solution" [RFC7202] 
         discusses, it is not an RTP payload format's responsibility to 
         discuss or mandate what solutions are used to meet the basic 
         security goals like confidentiality, integrity, and source 
         authenticity for RTP in general.  This responsibility lays on 
         anyone using RTP in an application.  They can find guidance on 
         available security mechanisms and important considerations in 
         "Options for Securing RTP Sessions" [RFC7201].  Applications 
         SHOULD use one or more appropriate strong security mechanisms.  
         The rest of this Security Considerations section discusses the 
         security impacting properties of the payload format itself. 

         This RTP payload format and its media decoder do not exhibit 
         any significant non-uniformity in the receiver-side 
         computational complexity for packet processing, and thus are 
         unlikely to pose a denial-of-service threat due to the receipt 
         of pathological data.  Nor does the RTP payload format contain 
         any active content. 

      7. IANA Considerations 

         The audio/scip and video/scip media subtypes have been 
         registered with IANA [AUDIOSCIP] [VIDEOSCIP].
