                     draft-ietf-httpbis-variants-06

Abstract

   This specification introduces an alternative way to select a HTTP
   response from a cache based upon its request headers, using the HTTP
   "Variants" and "Variant-Key" response header fields.  Its aim is to
   make HTTP proactive content negotiation more cache-friendly.

1.  Introduction

   HTTP proactive content negotiation ([RFC7231], Section 3.4.1) is
   seeing renewed interest, both for existing request headers like
   Accept-Language and for newer ones (for example, see
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-client-hints]).

   Successfully reusing negotiated responses that have been stored in a
   HTTP cache requires establishment of a secondary cache key
   ([RFC7234], Section 4.1).  Currently, the Vary header ([RFC7231],
   Section 7.1.4) does this by nominating a set of request headers.
   Their values collectively form the secondary cache key for a given
   response.

   HTTP's caching model allows a certain amount of latitude in
   normalising those request header field values, so as to increase the
   chances of a cache hit while still respecting the semantics of that
   header.  However, normalisation is not formally defined, leading to
   infrequent implementation in cache, and divergence of behaviours when
   it is.

   Even when the headers' semantics are understood, a cache does not
   know enough about the possible alternative representations available
   on the origin server to make an appropriate decision.

   For example, if a cache has stored the following request/response
   pair:

   GET /foo HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.com
   Accept-Language: en;q=0.5, fr;q=1.0


   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/html
   Content-Language: en
   Vary: Accept-Language
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   [English content]

   Provided that the cache has full knowledge of the semantics of
   Accept-Language and Content-Language, it will know that an English
   representation is available and might be able to infer that a French
   representation is not available.  But, it does not know (for example)
   whether a Japanese representation is available without making another
   request, incurring possibly unnecessary latency.

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         November 2019


   This specification introduces the HTTP Variants response header field
   (Section 2) to enumerate the available variant representations on the
   origin server, to provide clients and caches with enough information
   to properly satisfy requests - either by selecting a response from
   cache or by forwarding the request towards the origin - by following
   the algorithm defined in Section 4.

   Its companion Variant-Key response header field (Section 3) indicates
   the applicable key(s) that the response is associated with, so that
   it can be reliably reused in the future.  Effectively, it allows the
   specification of a request header field to define how it affects the
   secondary cache key.

   When this specification is in use, the example above might become:

   GET /foo HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.com
   Accept-Language: en;q=0.5, fr;q=1.0


   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/html
   Content-Language: en
   Vary: Accept-Language
   Variants: Accept-Language;de;en;jp
   Variant-Key: en
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   [English content]

   Proactive content negotiation mechanisms that wish to be used with
   Variants need to define how to do so explicitly; see Section 6.  As a
   result, it is best suited for negotiation over request headers that
   are well-understood.

   Variants also works best when content negotiation takes place over a
   constrained set of representations; since each variant needs to be
   listed in the header field, it is ill-suited for open-ended sets of
   representations.

   Variants can be seen as a simpler version of the Alternates header
   field introduced by [RFC2295]; unlike that mechanism, Variants does
   not require specification of each combination of attributes, and does
   not assume that each combination has a unique URL.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234] but relies on Structured Headers from
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure] for parsing.

   Additionally, it uses the "field-name" rule from [RFC7230], "type",
   "subtype", "content-coding" and "language-range" from [RFC7231], and
   "cookie-name" from [RFC6265].

2.  The "Variants" HTTP Header Field

   The Variants HTTP response header field indicates what
   representations are available for a given resource at the time that
   the response is produced, by enumerating the request header fields
   that it varies on, along with a representation of the values that are
   available for each.

   Variants is a Structured Header Dictionary (Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]).  Its ABNF is:

   Variants        = sh-dict

   Each member-name represents the field-name of a request header that
   is part of the secondary cache key; each member-value is an inner-
   list of strings or tokens that convey representations of potential
   values for that header field, hereafter referred to as "available-
   values".

   If Structured Header parsing fails or a member's value does have the
   structure outlined above, the client MUST treat the representation as
   having no Variants header field.

   Note that an available-value that is a token is interpreted as a
   string containing the same characters, and vice versa.

   So, given this example header field:

   Variants: Accept-Encoding=(gzip)






Nottingham                 Expires May 5, 2020                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         November 2019


   a recipient can infer that the only content-coding available for that
   resource is "gzip" (along with the "identity" non-encoding; see
   Appendix A.2).

   Given:

   Variants: accept-encoding=()

   a recipient can infer that no content-codings (beyond identity) are
   supported.  Note that as always, field-name is case-insensitive.

   A more complex example:

   Variants: Accept-Encoding=(gzip br), Accept-Language=(en fr)

   Here, recipients can infer that two content-codings in addition to
   "identity" are available, as well as two content languages.  Note
   that, as with all Structured Header dictionaries, they might occur in
   the same header field or separately, like this:

   Variants: Accept-Encoding=(gzip brotli)
   Variants: Accept-Language=(en fr)

   The ordering of available-values is significant, as it might be used
   by the header's algorithm for selecting a response (in this example,
   the first language is the default; see Appendix A.3).

   The ordering of the request header fields themselves indicates
   descending application of preferences; in the example above, a cache
   that has all of the possible permutations stored will honour the
   client's preferences for Accept-Encoding before honouring Accept-
   Language.

   Origin servers SHOULD consistently send Variant header fields on all
   cacheable (as per [RFC7234], Section 3) responses for a resource,
   since its absence will trigger caches to fall back to Vary
   processing.

   Likewise, servers MUST send the Variant-Key response header field
   when sending Variants, since its absence means that the stored
   response will not be reused when this specification is implemented.

   _RFC EDITOR: Please remove the next paragraph before publication._

   Implementations of drafts of this specification MUST implement an
   HTTP header field named "Variants-##" instead of the "Variants"
   header field specified by the final RFC, with "##" replaced by the

   draft number being implemented.  For example, implementations of
   draft-ietf-httpbis-variants-05 would implement "Variants-05".

2.1.  Relationship to Vary

   This specification updates [RFC7234] to allow caches that implement
   it to ignore request header fields in the Vary header for the
   purposes of secondary cache key calculation ([RFC7234], Section 4.1)
   when their semantics are implemented as per this specification and
   their corresponding response header field is listed in Variants.

   If any member of the Vary header does not have a corresponding
   variant that is understood by the implementation, it is still subject
   to the requirements there.

   See Section 5.1.3 for an example.

   In practice, implementation of Vary varies considerably.  As a
   result, cache efficiency might drop considerably when Variants does
   not contain all of the headers referenced by Vary, because some
   implementations might choose to disable Variants processing when this
   is the case.

3.  The "Variant-Key" HTTP Header Field

   The Variant-Key HTTP response header field identifies one or more
   sets of available-values that identify the secondary cache key(s)
   that the response it occurs within are associated with.

   Variant-Key is a Structured Header List (Section 3.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]) whose members are inner-lists of
   strings or tokens.  Its ABNF is:

   Variant-Key      = sh-list

   Each member MUST be an inner-list, and MUST itself have the same
   number of members as there are members of the representation's
   Variants header field.  If not, the client MUST treat the
   representation as having no Variant-Key header field.

   Each member identifies a list of available-values corresponding to
   the header field-names in the Variants header field, thereby
   identifying a secondary cache key that can be used with this
   response.  These available-values do not need to explicitly appear in
   the Variants header field; they can be interpreted by the algorithm
   specific to processing that field.  For example, Accept-Encoding
   defines an implicit "identity" available-value (Appendix A.2).




Nottingham                 Expires May 5, 2020                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         November 2019


   Each inner-list member is treated as identifying an available-value
   for the corresponding variant-axis' field-name.  Any list-member that
   is a token is interpreted as a string containing the same characters.

   For example:

   Variants: Accept-Encoding=(gzip br), Accept-Language=(en fr)
   Variant-Key: (gzip fr)

   This header pair indicates that the representation has a "gzip"
   content-coding and "fr" content-language.

   If the response can be used to satisfy more than one request, they
   can be listed in additional members.  For example:

   Variants: Accept-Encoding=(gzip br), Accept-Language=(en fr)
   Variant-Key: (gzip fr), ("identity" fr)

   indicates that this response can be used for requests whose Accept-
   Encoding algorithm selects "gzip" or "identity", as long as the
   Accept-Language algorithm selects "fr" - perhaps because there is no
   gzip-compressed French representation.

   When more than one Variant-Key value is in a response, the first one
   present MUST correspond to the request that caused that response to
   be generated.  For example:

   Variants: Accept-Encoding=(gzip br), Accept-Language=(en fr)
   Variant-Key: (gzip fr), (identity fr), (br fr oops)

   is treated as if the Variant-Key header were completely absent, which
   will tend to disable caching for the representation that contains it.

   Note that in

   Variant-Key: (gzip  fr)
   Variant-Key: ("gzip " fr)

   The whitespace after "gzip" in the first header field value is
   excluded by the parsing algorithm, but the whitespace in the second
   header field value is included by the string parsing algorithm.  This
   will likely cause the second header field value to fail to match
   client requests.

   _RFC EDITOR: Please remove the next paragraph before publication._

   Implementations of drafts of this specification MUST implement an
   HTTP header field named "Variant-Key-##" instead of the "Variant-Key"

   header field specified by the final RFC, with "##" replaced by the
   draft number being implemented.  For example, implementations of
   draft-ietf-httpbis-variants-05 would implement "Variant-Key-05".

4.  Cache Behaviour

   Caches that implement the Variants header field and the relevant
   semantics of the field-names it contains can use that knowledge to
   either select an appropriate stored representation, or forward the
   request if no appropriate representation is stored.

   They do so by running this algorithm (or its functional equivalent)
   upon receiving a request:

   Given incoming-request (a mapping of field-names to field-values,
   after being combined as allowed by Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7230]), and
   stored-responses (a list of stored responses suitable for reuse as
   defined in Section 4 of [RFC7234], excepting the requirement to
   calculate a secondary cache key):

   1.  If stored-responses is empty, return an empty list.

   2.  Order stored-responses by the "Date" header field, most recent to
       least recent.

   3.  Let sorted-variants be an empty list.

   4.  If the freshest member of stored-responses (as per [RFC7234],
       Section 4.2) has one or more "Variants" header field(s) that
       successfully parse according to Section 2:

       1.  Select one member of stored-responses with a "Variants"
           header field-value(s) that successfully parses according to
           Section 2 and let variants-header be this parsed value.  This
           SHOULD be the most recent response, but MAY be from an older
           one as long as it is still fresh.

       2.  For each variant-axis in variants-header:

           1.  If variant-axis' field-name corresponds to the request
               header field identified by a content negotiation
               mechanism that the implementation supports:

               1.  Let request-value be the field-value associated with
                   field-name in incoming-request, or null if field-name
                   is not in incoming-request.

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         November 2019


               2.  Let sorted-values be the result of running the
                   algorithm defined by the content negotiation
                   mechanism with request-value and variant-axis'
                   available-values.

               3.  Append sorted-values to sorted-variants.

           At this point, sorted-variants will be a list of lists, each
           member of the top-level list corresponding to a variant-axis
           in the Variants header field-value, containing zero or more
           items indicating available-values that are acceptable to the
           client, in order of preference, greatest to least.

   5.  Return result of running Compute Possible Keys (Section 4.1) on
       sorted-variants, an empty list and an empty list.

   This returns a list of lists of strings suitable for comparing to the
   parsed Variant-Keys (Section 3) that represent possible responses on
   the server that can be used to satisfy the request, in preference
   order, provided that their secondary cache key (after removing the
   headers covered by Variants) matches.  Section 4.2 illustrates one
   way to do this.

4.1.  Compute Possible Keys

   This algorithm computes the cross-product of the elements of key-
   facets.

   Given key-facets (a list of lists of strings), and key-stub (a list
   of strings representing a partial key), and possible-keys (a list of
   lists of strings):

   1.  Let values be the first member of key-facets.

   2.  Let remaining-facets be a copy of all of the members of key-
       facets except the first.

   3.  For each value in values:

       1.  Let this-key be a copy of key-stub.

       2.  Append value to this-key.

       3.  If remaining-facets is empty, append this-key to possible-
           keys.

       4.  Otherwise, run Compute Possible Keys on remaining-facets,
           this-key and possible-keys.

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         November 2019


   4.  Return possible-keys.

4.2.  Check Vary

   This algorithm is an example of how an implementation can meet the
   requirement to apply the members of the Vary header field that are
   not covered by Variants.

   Given incoming-request (a mapping of field-names to field-values,
   after being combined as allowed by Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7230]), and
   stored-response (a stored response):

   1.  Let filtered-vary be the field-value(s) of stored-response's
       "Vary" header field.

   2.  Let processed-variants be a list containing the request header
       fields that identify the content negotiation mechanisms supported
       by the implementation.

   3.  Remove any member of filtered-vary that is a case-insensitive
       match for a member of processed-variants.

   4.  If the secondary cache key (as calculated in [RFC7234],
       Section 4.1) for stored_response matches incoming-request, using
       filtered-vary for the value of the "Vary" response header, return
       True.

   5.  Return False.

   This returns a Boolean that indicates whether stored-response can be
   used to satisfy the request.

   Note that implementation of the Vary header field varies in practice,
   and the algorithm above illustrates only one way to apply it.  It is
   equally viable to forward the request if there is a request header
   listed in Vary but not Variants.

4.3.  Example of Cache Behaviour

   For example, if the selected variants-header was:

   Variants: Accept-Language=(en fr de), Accept-Encoding=(gzip br)

   and the request contained the headers:

   Accept-Language: fr;q=1.0, en;q=0.1
   Accept-Encoding: gzip

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         November 2019


   Then the sorted-variants would be:

   [
     ["fr", "en"]         // prefers French, will accept English
     ["gzip", "identity"] // prefers gzip encoding, will accept identity
   ]

   Which means that the result of the Cache Behaviour algorithm would
   be:

   [
     ["fr", "gzip"],
     ["fr", "identity"],
     ["en", "gzip"],
     ["en", "identity"]
   ]

   Representing a first preference of a French, gzip'd response.  Thus,
   if a cache has a response with:

   Variant-Key: (fr gzip)

   it could be used to satisfy the first preference.  If not, responses
   corresponding to the other keys could be returned, or the request
   could be forwarded towards the origin.

4.3.1.  A Variant Missing From the Cache

   If the selected variants-header was:

   Variants: Accept-Language=(en fr de)

   And a request comes in with the following headers:

   Accept-Language: de;q=1.0, es;q=0.8

   Then sorted-variants in Cache Behaviour is:

   [
     ["de"]         // prefers German; will not accept English
   ]

   If the cache contains responses with the following Variant-Keys:

   Variant-Key: (fr)
   Variant-Key: (en)

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         November 2019


   Then the cache needs to forward the request to the origin server,
   since Variants indicates that "de" is available, and that is
   acceptable to the client.

4.3.2.  Variants That Don't Overlap the Client's Request

   If the selected variants-header was:

   Variants: Accept-Language=(en fr de)

   And a request comes in with the following headers:

   Accept-Language: es;q=1.0, ja;q=0.8

   Then sorted-variants in Cache Behaviour are:

   [
     ["en"]
   ]

   This allows the cache to return a "Variant-Key: en" response even
   though it's not in the set the client prefers.

5.  Origin Server Behaviour

   Origin servers that wish to take advantage of Variants will need to
   generate both the Variants (Section 2) and Variant-Key (Section 3)
   header fields in all cacheable responses for a given resource.  If
   either is omitted and the response is stored, it will have the effect
   of disabling caching for that resource until it is no longer stored
   (e.g., it expires, or is evicted).

   Likewise, origin servers will need to assure that the members of both
   header field values are in the same order and have the same length,
   since discrepancies will cause caches to avoid using the responses
   they occur in.

   The value of the Variants header should be relatively stable for a
   given resource over time; when it changes, it can have the effect of
   invalidating previously stored responses.

   As per Section 2.1, the Vary header is required to be set
   appropriately when Variants is in use, so that caches that do not
   implement this specification still operate correctly.

   Origin servers are advised to carefully consider which content
   negotiation mechanisms to enumerate in Variants; if a mechanism is

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         November 2019


   not supported by a receiving cache, it will "downgrade" to Vary
   handling, which can negatively impact cache efficiency.

5.1.  Examples

   The operation of Variants is illustrated by the examples below.

5.1.1.  Single Variant

   Given a request/response pair:

   GET /clancy HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.com
   Accept-Language: en;q=1.0, fr;q=0.5


   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: image/gif
   Content-Language: en
   Cache-Control: max-age=3600
   Variants: Accept-Language=(en de)
   Variant-Key: (en)
   Vary: Accept-Language
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   Upon receipt of this response, the cache knows that two
   representations of this resource are available, one with a language
   of "en", and another whose language is "de".

   Subsequent requests (while this response is fresh) will cause the
   cache to either reuse this response or forward the request, depending
   on what the selection algorithm determines.

   So, if a request with "en" in Accept-Language is received and its
   q-value indicates that it is acceptable, the stored response is used.
   A request that indicates that "de" is acceptable will be forwarded to
   the origin, thereby populating the cache.  A cache receiving a
   request that indicates both languages are acceptable will use the
   q-value to make a determination of what response to return.

   A cache receiving a request that does not list either language as
   acceptable (or does not contain an Accept-Language at all) will
   return the "en" representation (possibly fetching it from the
   origin), since it is listed first in the Variants list.

   Note that Accept-Language is listed in Vary, to assure backwards-
   compatibility with caches that do not support Variants.

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         November 2019


5.1.2.  Multiple Variants

   A more complicated request/response pair:

   GET /murray HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.net
   Accept-Language: en;q=1.0, fr;q=0.5
   Accept-Encoding: gzip, br


   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: image/gif
   Content-Language: en
   Content-Encoding: br
   Variants: Accept-Language=(en jp de)
   Variants: Accept-Encoding=(br gzip)
   Variant-Key: (en br)
   Vary: Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   Here, the cache knows that there are two axes that the response
   varies upon; language and encoding.  Thus, there are a total of nine
   possible representations for the resource (including the identity
   encoding), and the cache needs to consider the selection algorithms
   for both axes.

   Upon a subsequent request, if both selection algorithms return a
   stored representation, it can be served from cache; otherwise, the
   request will need to be forwarded to origin.

5.1.3.  Partial Coverage

   Now, consider the previous example, but where only one of the Vary'd
   axes (encoding) is listed in Variants:

   GET /bar HTTP/1.1
   Host: www.example.net
   Accept-Language: en;q=1.0, fr;q=0.5
   Accept-Encoding: gzip, br

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         November 2019


   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: image/gif
   Content-Language: en
   Content-Encoding: br
   Variants: Accept-Encoding=(br gzip)
   Variant-Key: (br)
   Vary: Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked

   Here, the cache will need to calculate a secondary cache key as per
   [RFC7234], Section 4.1 - but considering only Accept-Language to be
   in its field-value - and then continue processing Variants for the
   set of stored responses that the algorithm described there selects.

6.  Defining Content Negotiation Using Variants

   To be usable with Variants, proactive content negotiation mechanisms
   need to be specified to take advantage of it.  Specifically, they:

   o  MUST define a request header field that advertises the clients
      preferences or capabilities, whose field-name SHOULD begin with
      "Accept-".

   o  MUST define the syntax of an available-value that will occur in
      Variants and Variant-Key.

   o  MUST define an algorithm for selecting a result.  It MUST return a
      list of available-values that are suitable for the request, in
      order of preference, given the value of the request header
      nominated above (or null if the request header is absent) and an
      available-values list from the Variants header.  If the result is
      an empty list, it implies that the cache cannot satisfy the
      request.

   Appendix A fulfils these requirements for some existing proactive
   content negotiation mechanisms in HTTP.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers the following entry in the Permanent
   Message Header Field Names registry established by [RFC3864]:

   o  Header field name: Variants

   o  Status: standard

8.  Security Considerations

   If the number or advertised characteristics of the representations
   available for a resource are considered sensitive, the Variants
   header by its nature will leak them.

   Note that the Variants header is not a commitment to make
   representations of a certain nature available; the runtime behaviour
   of the server always overrides hints like Variants.

Appendix A.  Variants for Existing Content Negotiation Mechanisms

   This appendix defines the required information to use existing
   proactive content negotiation mechanisms (as defined in [RFC7231],
   Section 5.3) with the Variants header field.

A.1.  Accept

   This section defines variant handling for the Accept request header
   (section 5.3.2 of [RFC7231]).

   The syntax of an available-value for Accept is:

   accept-available-value = type "/" subtype

   To perform content negotiation for Accept given a request-value and
   available-values:

   1.  Let preferred-available be an empty list.

   2.  Let preferred-types be a list of the types in the request-value
       (or the empty list if request-value is null), ordered by their
       weight, highest to lowest, as per Section 5.3.2 of [RFC7231]
       (omitting any coding with a weight of 0).  If a type lacks an
       explicit weight, an implementation MAY assign one.

   3.  For each preferred-type in preferred-types:

       1.  If any member of available-values matches preferred-type,
           using the media-range matching mechanism specified in
           Section 5.3.2 of [RFC7231] (which is case-insensitive),
           append those members of available-values to preferred-
           available (preserving the precedence order implied by the
           media ranges' specificity).

   4.  If preferred-available is empty, append the first member of
       available-values to preferred-available.  This makes the first
       available-value the default when none of the client's preferences
       are available.

   5.  Return preferred-available.

   Note that this algorithm explicitly ignores extension parameters on
   media types (e.g., "charset").

Internet-Draft        HTTP Representation Variants         November 2019


A.2.  Accept-Encoding

   This section defines variant handling for the Accept-Encoding request
   header (section 5.3.4 of [RFC7231]).

   The syntax of an available-value for Accept-Encoding is:

   accept-encoding-available-value = content-coding / "identity"

   To perform content negotiation for Accept-Encoding given a request-
   value and available-values:

   1.  Let preferred-available be an empty list.

   2.  Let preferred-codings be a list of the codings in the request-
       value (or the empty list if request-value is null), ordered by
       their weight, highest to lowest, as per Section 5.3.1 of
       [RFC7231] (omitting any coding with a weight of 0).  If a coding
       lacks an explicit weight, an implementation MAY assign one.

   3.  If "identity" is not a member of preferred-codings, append
       "identity".

   4.  Append "identity" to available-values.

   5.  For each preferred-coding in preferred-codings:

       1.  If there is a case-insensitive, character-for-character match
           for preferred-coding in available-values, append that member
           of available-values to preferred-available.

   6.  Return preferred-available.

   Note that the unencoded variant needs to have a Variant-Key header
   field with a value of "identity" (as defined in Section 5.3.4 of
   [RFC7231]).

A.3.  Accept-Language

   This section defines variant handling for the Accept-Language request
   header (section 5.3.5 of [RFC7231]).

   The syntax of an available-value for Accept-Language is:

   accept-encoding-available-value = language-range

   To perform content negotiation for Accept-Language given a request-
   value and available-values:

   1.  Let preferred-available be an empty list.

   2.  Let preferred-langs be a list of the language-ranges in the
       request-value (or the empty list if request-value is null),
       ordered by their weight, highest to lowest, as per Section 5.3.1
       of [RFC7231] (omitting any language-range with a weight of 0).
       If a language-range lacks a weight, an implementation MAY assign
       one.

   3.  For each preferred-lang in preferred-langs:

       1.  If any member of available-values matches preferred-lang,
           using either the Basic or Extended Filtering scheme defined
           in Section 3.3 of [RFC4647], append those members of
           available-values to preferred-available (preserving their
           order).

   4.  If preferred-available is empty, append the first member of
       available-values to preferred-available.  This makes the first
       available-value the default when none of the client's preferences
       are available.

   5.  Return preferred-available.

A.4.  Cookie

   This section defines variant handling for the Cookie request header
   ([RFC6265]).

   This syntax of an available-value for Cookie is:

   cookie-available-value = cookie-name

   To perform content negotiation for Cookie given a request-value and
   available-values:

   1.  Let cookies-available be an empty list.

   2.  For each available-value of available-values:

       1.  Parse request-value as a Cookie header field [RFC6265] and
           let request-cookie-value be the cookie-value corresponding to
           a cookie with a cookie-name that matches available-value.  If
           no match is found, continue to the next available-value.

       2.  append request-cookie-value to cookies-available.

   3.  Return cookies-available.

   A simple example is allowing a page designed for users that aren't
   logged in (denoted by the "logged_in" cookie-name) to be cached:

   Variants: Cookie=(logged_in)
   Variant-Key: (0)
   Vary: Cookie

   Here, a cache that implements Variants will only use this response to
   satisfy requests with "Cookie: logged_in=0".  Caches that don't
   implement Variants will vary the response on all Cookie headers.

   Or, consider this example:

   Variants: Cookie=(user_priority)
   Variant-Key: (silver), ("bronze")
   Vary: Cookie

   Here, the "user_priority" cookie-name allows requests from "gold"
   users to be separated from "silver" and "bronze" ones; this response
   is only served to the latter two.

   It is possible to target a response to a single user; for example:

   Variants: Cookie=(user_id)
   Variant-Key: (some_person)
   Vary: Cookie

   Here, only the "some_person" "user_id" will have this response served
   to them again.

   Note that if more than one cookie-name serves as a cache key, they'll
   need to be listed in separate Variants members, like this:

   Variants: Cookie=(user_priority), Cookie=(user_region)
   Variant-Key: (gold europe)
   Vary: Cookie
