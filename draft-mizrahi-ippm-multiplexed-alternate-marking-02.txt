1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background

   Alternate marking, defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-alt-mark], is a method
   for measuring packet loss, packet delay, and packet delay variation.
   Typical delay measurement protocols require the two measurement
   points (MPs) to exchange timestamped test packets.  In contrast, the
   alternate marking method does not require control packets to be
   exchanged.  Instead, every data packet carries a color indicator,
   which divides the traffic into consecutive blocks of packets.

   The color value is toggled periodically, as illustrated in Figure 1.


   A: packet with color 0
   B: packet with color 1

   Packets      AAAAAAAAAA BBBBBBBBBB AAAAAAAAAA BBBBBBBBBB AAAAAAAAAA

     Figure 1: Alternate marking: packets are monitored on a per-color
                                  basis.

   Alternate marking is used between two MPs, the initiating MP, and the
   monitoring MP.  The initiating MP incorporates the marking field into
   en-route packets, allowing the monitoring MP to use the marking field
   in order to bind each packet to the corresponding block.

   Each of the MPs maintains two counters, one per color.  At the end of
   each block the counter values can be collected by a central
   management system, and analyzed; the packet loss can be computed by
   comparing the counter values of the two MPs.

   When using alternate marking delay measurement can be performed in
   one of three ways (as per [I-D.ietf-ippm-alt-mark]):

   o  Single marking using the first packet: in this method each packet
      uses a single marking bit, used as a color indicator.  The first
      packet of each block is used by both MPs as a reference for delay
      measurement.  The timestamp of this packet is measured by the two
      measurement points, and can be collected by the mangement system
      from each of the measurement points, which can compute the path
      delay by comparing the two timestamps.  The drawback of this

Internet-Draft        Multiplexed Alternate Marking            June 2017


      approach is that it is not accurate when packets arrive out-of-
      order, as the two MPs may have a different view of which packet
      was the first in the block.

   o  Single marking using the mean delay: as in the previous method,
      each packet uses a single marking method, indicating the color.
      Each of the MPs computes the average packet timestamp of each
      block.  The management system can then compute the delay by
      comparing the average times of the two MPs.  The drawback of this
      approach is that it may be computationally heavy, or difficult to
      implement at the data plane.

   o  Double marking: each packet uses two marking bits.  One bit is
      used as a color indicator, and one is used as a timestamping
      indicator.  This method resolves the drawbacks raised for the two
      previous methods, at the expense of an extra bit in the packet
      header.

   The double marking method is the most straightforward approach.  It
   allows for accurate measurement without incurring expensive
   computational load.  However, in some cases allocating two bits for
   passive measurement is not possible.  For example, if alternate
   marking is implemented over IPv4, allocating 2 marking bits in the
   IPv4 header is challenging, as every bit in the 20-octet header is
   costly; one of the possible approaches discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-alt-mark] is to reserve one or two bits from the DSCP
   field for remarking.  In this case every marking bit comes at the
   expense of reducing the DSCP range by a factor of two.

1.2.  The Scope of This Document

   This memo extends the marking methods of [I-D.ietf-ippm-alt-mark],
   and introduces methods that require a single marking bit, or zero
   marking bits.

   Two single-bit marking methods are proposed, multiplexed marking and
   pulse marking.  In multiplexed marking the color indicator and the
   timestamp indicator are multiplexed into a single bit, providing the
   advantages of the double marking method while using a single bit in
   the packet header.  In pulse marking both delay and loss measurement
   are triggered by a 'pulse' value in a single marking field.

   This document also discusses zero-bit marking methods that leverage
   well-known hash-based selection [RFC5475] approaches.

   Alternate marking is discussed in this memo as a single-bit or a two-
   bit marking method.  However, these methods can similarly be applied
   to larger fields, such as an IPv6 Flow Label or an MPLS Label;

   single-bit marking can be applied using two reserved values, and two-
   bit marking can be applied using four reserved values.  Marking based
   on reserved values is further discussed in this document, including
   its application to MPLS and IPv6.

   Finally, this memo summarizes the alternate marking methods, and
   discusses the tradeoffs among them.  It is expected that different
   network protocols will have different constraints, and therefore may
   choose to use different alternate marking methods.  In some cases it
   may be preferable to support more than one marking method; in this
   case the particular marking method may be signaled through the
   control plane.

3.  Marking Abstractions

   The marking methods that were discussed in Section 1, as well as the
   methods introduced in this document, use two basic abstractions,
   pulse detection, and step detection.

   The common thread along the various marking methods is that one or
   two marking bits are used by the MPs to signal a measurement event.




Mizrahi, et al.         Expires December 31, 2017               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft        Multiplexed Alternate Marking            June 2017


   The value of the marking bit indicates when the event takes place, in
   one of two ways:

   Pulse         An event is detected when the value of the marking bit
                 is toggled in a single packet.

   Step          An event is detected when the value of the marking bit
                 is toggled, and remains at the new value.

   The double marking method (Section 1) uses pulse-based detection for
   DM, and step-based detection for LM.

   Pulse-based detection affects the processing of a single packet; the
   packet that indicates the pulse is processed differently than the
   packets around it.  For example, in the double marking method, the
   marked packet is timestamped for DM, without affecting the packets
   before or after it.  Note that if the marked packet is lost, no pulse
   is detected, yielding a missing measurement (see Figure 2).

                     Figure 2: Pulse-based Detection.

   In step-based detection the event is detected by observing a value
   change in stream of packets.  Specifically, when the step approach is
   used for LM (as in the double marking method), two counters are used
   per flow; each MP decides which counter to use based on the value of
   the marking bit.  Thus, the step-based approach allows accurate
   counting even when packets arrive out-of-order (see Figure 3).  When
   the step approach is used for DM (e.g., single marking using the
   first packet), out-of-order causes the delay measurement to be false,
   without any indication to the management system.

                      Figure 3: Step-based Detection.

4.  Double Marking

   The two-bit marking method of [I-D.ietf-ippm-alt-mark] uses two
   marking bits: a color indicator, and a delay measurement indicator.
   The color bit is used for step-based LM, while the delay bit is used
   as a pulse-based DM trigger.  This double marking approach is the
   most straightforward of the approaches discussed in this memo, as it
   allows accurate measurement, it is resilient to out-of-order
   delivery, and is relatively simple to implement.  The main drawback
   is that it requires two bits, which are not always available.

   Figure 4 illustrates the double marking method: each block of packets
   includes a packet that is marked for timestamping, and therefore has
   its delay bit set.

5.  Single-bit Marking

5.1.  Single Marking Using the First Packet

   This method uses a single marking bit that indicates the color, as
   described in [I-D.ietf-ippm-alt-mark].  Both LM and DM are
   implemented using a step-based approach; LM is implemented using two
   color-based counters per flow.  The first packet of every period is
   used by the two MPs as the reference for measuring the delay.  As
   denoted above, the delay computed in this method may be erroneous
   when packets are delivered out-of-order.

       Figure 5: Single marking using the first packet of the block.

5.2.  Single Marking using the Mean Delay

   As in the first-packet approach, in the mean delay approach
   ([I-D.ietf-ippm-alt-mark]) a single marking bit is used to indicate
   the color, enabling step-based loss measurement.  Delay is measured
   in each period by averaging the measured delay over all the packets
   in the period.  As discussed above, this approach is not sensitive to
   out-of-order delivery, but may be heavy from a computational
   perspective.

5.3.  Alternate Marking using a Multiplexed Marking Bit

5.3.1.  Overview

   This section introduces a method that uses a single marking bit that
   serves two purposes: a color indicator, and a timestamp indicator.
   The double marking method that was discussed in the previous section
   uses two 1-bit values: a color indicator C, and a timestamp indicator

   T.  The multiplexed marking bit, denoted by M, is an exclusive or
   between these two values: M = C XOR T.

   An example of the use of the multiplexed marking bit is depicted in
   Figure 6.  The example considers two routers, R1 and R2, that use the
   multiplexed bit method to measure traffic from R1 to R2.  In each
   block R1 designates one of the packets for delay measurement.  In
   each of these designated packets the value of the multiplexed bit is
   reversed compared to the other packets in the same block, allowing R2
   to distinguish the designated packets from the other packets.

5.3.2.  Timing and Synchronization Aspects

   It is assumed that all MPs are synchronized to a common reference
   time with an accuracy of +/- A/2.  Thus, the difference between the
   clock values of any two MPs is bounded by A.  Clocks can be
   synchronized for example using NTP [RFC5905], PTP [IEEE1588], or by
   other means.  The common reference time is used for dividing the time
   domain into equal-sized measurement periods, such that all packets
   forwarded during a measurement period have the same color, and
   consecutive periods have alternating colors.

   The single marking bit incorporates two multiplexed values.  From the
   monitoring MP's perspective, the two values are Time-Division
   Multiplexed (TDM), as depicted in Figure 7.  It is assumed that the
   start time of every measurement period is known to both the
   initiating MP and the monitoring MP.  If the measurement period is L,
   then during the first and the last L/4 time units of each block the

   marking bit is interpreted by the monitoring MP as a color indicator.
   During the middle part of the block, the marking bit is interpreted
   as a timestamp indicator; if the value of this bit is different than
   the color value, the corresponding packet is used as a reference for
   delay measurement.

                            measurement point.

   In order to prevent ambiguity in the receiver's interpretation of the
   marking field, the initiating MP is permitted to set the timestamp
   indication only during a specific interval, as depicted in Figure 8.
   Since the receiver is willing to receive the timestamp indication
   during the middle L/2 time units of the block, the sender refrains
   from sending the timestamp indication during a guardband interval of
   d time units at the beginning and end of the L/2-period.

   The guardband d is given by d = A + D_max - D_min, where A is the
   clock accuracy, D_max is an upper bound on the network delay between
   the MPs, and D_min is a lower bound on the delay.  It is
   straightforward from Figure 8 that d < L/4 must be satisfied.  The
   latter implies a minimal requirement on the synchronization accuracy.

   All MPs must be synchronized to the same reference time with an
   accuracy of +/- L/8.  Depending on the system topology, in some
   systems the accuracy requirement will be even more stringent, subject
   to d < L/4.  Note that the accuracy requirement of the conventional
   alternate marking method [I-D.ietf-ippm-alt-mark] is +/- L/2, while
   the multiplexed marking method requires an accuracy of +/- L/8.

   Note that we assume that the middle L/2-period is designated as the
   timestamp indication period, allowing a sufficiently long guardband
   between the transitions.  However, a system may be configured to use
   a longer timestamp indication period or a shorter one, if it is
   guaranteed that the synchronization accuracy meets the guardband
   requirements (i.e., the constraints on d).

5.4.  Pulse Marking

   Pulse marking uses a single marking bit that is used as a trigger for
   both LM and DM.  In this method the two MPs maintain a single per-
   flow counter for LM, in contrast to the color-based methods which
   require two counters per flow.  In each block one of the packets is
   marked.  The marked packet triggers two actions in each of MPs:

   o  The timestamp is captured for DM.



Mizrahi, et al.         Expires December 31, 2017              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft        Multiplexed Alternate Marking            June 2017


   o  The value of the counter is captured for LM.

   In each period, each of the MPs exports the timestamp and counter-
   stamp to the management system, which can then compute the loss and
   delay in that period.  It should be noted that as in
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-alt-mark], if the length of the measurement period is
   L time units, then all network devices must be synchronized to the
   same clock reference with an accuracy of +/- L/2 time units.

   The pulse marking approach is illustrated in Figure 9.  Since both LM
   and DM use a pulse-based trigger, if the marked packet is lost then
   no measurement is available in this period.  Moreover, the LM
   accuracy may be affected by out-of-order delivery.

6.  Zero-bit Marking

6.1.  Hash-based Sampling

   Hash based selection [RFC5475] is a well-known method for sampling a
   subset of packets.  As defined in [RFC5475]:

      A Hash Function h maps the Packet Content c, or some portion of
      it, onto a Hash Range R.  The packet is selected if h(c) is an
      element of S, which is a subset of R called the Hash Selection
      Range.

   Hash-based selection can be leveraged as a marking method, allowing a
   zero-bit marking approach.  Specifically, the pulse and step
   abstractions can be implemented using hashed selection:




Mizrahi, et al.         Expires December 31, 2017              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        Multiplexed Alternate Marking            June 2017


   o  Hashed pulse-based trigger: in this approach, a packet is selected
      if h(c) is an element of S, which is a strict subset of the hash
      range R.  When |S|<<|R|, the average sampling period is long,
      reducing the probability of ambiguity between consecutive
      packets. |S| and |R| denote the number of elements in S and R,
      respectively.

   o  Hashed step-based trigger: the hash values of a given traffic flow
      are said to be monotonically increasing if for two packets p1 and
      p2, if p1 is sent before p2 then h(p1)<=h(p2).  If it is
      guaranteed that the hash values of a flow are monotonically
      increasing, then a step-based approach can be used on the range R.
      For example, in an IPv4 flow the Identification field can be used
      as the hash value of each packet.  Since the Identification field
      is monotonically increasing, the step-based trigger can be
      implemented using consecutive ranges of the Identification value.
      For example, the fourth bit of the Identification field is toggled
      every 8 packets.  Thus, a possible hash function simply takes the
      fourth bit of the Identification field as the hash value.  This
      hash value is toggled every 8 packets, simulating the alternate
      marking behavior of Section 4.

   Note that as opposed to the double marking and single marking
   methods, hashed sampling is not based on fixed time intervals, as the
   duration between sampled packets depends only on the hash value.

   It is also important to note that all methods that use hash-based
   marking require the hash function and the set S to be configured
   consistently across the MPs.

6.2.  Hashed Pulse Marking

   In this approach a hash is computed over the packet content, and both
   LM and DM are triggered based on the pulse-based trigger
   (Section 6.1).  A pulse is detected when the hash value h(c) is equal
   to one of the values in S.  The hash function h and the set S
   determine the probability (or frequency) of the pulse event.

6.3.  Hashed Double Marking

   As in the previous approach, hashed double marking also uses a hash
   that is computed over the packet content.  In this approach DM is
   performed using a pulse-based trigger, whereas the LM trigger is
   step-based (Section 6.1).  The main drawback of this method is that
   the step-based trigger is possible only under the assumption that the
   hash function is monotonically increasing, which is not necessarily
   possible in all cases.  Specifically, a measured flow is not
   necessarily an IPv4 5-tuple.  For example, a measured flow may

Internet-Draft        Multiplexed Alternate Marking            June 2017


   include multiple IPv4 5-tuple flows, and in this case the
   Identification field is not monotonically increasing.

6.4.  Mixed Hashed Marking

   Mixed hashed marking combines the single marking approach with hash-
   based sampling.  A single marking bit is used in the packet header as
   a color indicator, while a hash-based pulse is used to trigger DM.
   Although this method requires a single bit, it is described in this
   section as it is closely related to the other hash-based methods that
   require zero marking bits.

7.  Summary of Marking Methods

   This section summarizes the marking methods described in this memo.
   Each row in the table of Figure 10 represents a marking method.  For
   each method the table specifies the number of bits required in the
   header, the number of counters per flow for LM, the methods used for
   LM and DM (pulse or step), and also the resilience to disturbances.

                   Figure 10: Summary of Marking Methods

   In the context of this comparison two possible disturbances are
   considered: out-of-order delivery, and packet drops.  Generally
   speaking, pulse based methods are sensitive to packet drops, since if
   the marked packet is dropped no measurement is recorded in the
   current period.  Notably, a missing measurement is detectable by the
   management system, and is not as severe as a false measurement.
   Step-based triggers are generally resilient to out-of-order delivery
   for LM, but are not resilient to out-of-order delivery for DM.
   Notably, a step-based trigger may yield a false delay measurement
   when packets are delivered out-of-order, and this inaccuracy is not
   detectable.

   As mentioned above, the double marking method is the most
   straightforward approach, and is resilient to most of the
   disturbances that were analyzed.  Its obvious drawback is that it
   requires two marking bits.

   Several single marking methods are discussed in this memo.  In this
   case there is no clear verdict which method is the optimal one.  The
   first packet method may be simple to implement, but may present
   erroneous delay measurements in case of dropped or reordered packets.
   Arguably, the mean delay approach and the multiplexed approach may be
   more difficult to implement (depending on the underlying platform),
   but are more resilient to the disturbances that were considered here.
   Note that the computational complexity of the mean delay approach can
   be reduced by combining it with a hashed approach, i.e., by computing
   the mean delay over a hash-based subset of the packets.  The pulse
   marking method requires only a single counter per flow, while the
   other methods require two counters per flow.

   The hash-based sampling approaches reduce the overhead to zero bits,
   which is a significant advantage.  However, the sampling period in
   these approaches is not associated with a fixed time interval.
   Therefore, in some cases adjacent packets may be selected for the
   sampling, potentially causing measurement errors.  Furthermore, when
   the traffic rate is low, measurements may become signifcantly
   infrequent.

   It should be noted that most of the marking methods that were
   presented in this memo are intended for point-to-point measurements,
   e.g., from MP1 to MP2 in Figure 11.  In point-to-multipoint
   measurements, the mean delay method can be used to measure the loss
   and delay of the entire point-to-multipoint flow (which includes all
   the traffic from MP3 to either MP4 or MP5), while other methods such
   as double marking can be used to measure the point-to-point
   performance, for example from MP3 to MP5.  Alternate marking in
   multipoint scenarios is discussed in detail in
   [I-D.fioccola-ippm-multipoint-alt-mark].

8.  Alternate Marking using Reserved Values

   As mentioned in Section 1, a marking bit is not necessarily a single
   bit, but may be implemented by using two well-known values in one of
   the header fields.  Similarly, two-bit marking can be implemented
   using four reserved values.

   A notable example is MPLS Synonymous Flow Labels (SFL), as defined in
   [I-D.bryant-mpls-rfc6374-sfl].  Two MPLS Label values can be used to
   indicate the two colors of a given LSP: the original Label value, and
   an SFL value.  A similar approach can be applied to IPv6 using the
   Flow Label field.

   The following example illustrates how alternate marking can be
   implemented using reserved values.  The bit multiplexing approach of
   Section 5.3 is applicable not only to single-bit color indicators,
   but also to two-value indicators; instead of using a single bit that
   is toggled between '0' and '1', two values of the indicator field, U
   and W, can be used in the same manner, allowing both loss and delay
   measurement to be performed using only two reserved values.  Thus,
   the multiplexing approach of Figure 6 can be illustrated more
   generally with two values, U and W, as depicted in Figure 12.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no requests from IANA.

10.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the alternate marking method are
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-ippm-alt-mark].  The analysis of Section 7
   emphasizes the sensitivity of some of the alternate marking methods
   to packet drops and to packet reordering.  Thus, a malicious attacker
   may attempt to tamper with the measurements by either selectively
   dropping packets, or by selectively reordering specific packets.  The
   multiplexed marking method Section 5.3 that is defined in this
   document requires slightly more stringent synchronization than the
   conventional marking method, potentially making the method more
   vulnerable to attacks on the time synchronization protocol.  A
   detailed discussion about the threats against time protocols and how
   to mitigate them is presented in [RFC7384].
