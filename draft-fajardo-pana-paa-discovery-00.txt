Abstract

   The PANA Base protocol defines a method for carrying EAP message
   exchanges over UDP/IP.  This means that the PANA Client (PaC) is
   required to know the IP address of the PANA Authentication Agent
   (PAA).  In many cases, this is not convinient or practical.  This
   document proposes a simple PAA discovery scheme that allows the PaC
   to determine the PAA IP address without any modification to the base

Internet-Draft     Simple PANA PAA Discovery Protocol       January 2008


1.  Introduction

   The PANA Base protocol specifies that all messages are carried over
   unicast UDP/IP packet.  This means that the PANA Client (PaC) needs
   to know the PANA Authentication Agent (PAA) IP address before
   initiating a PANA conversation.  Like many other protocols, it is not
   practical nor convinient to configure client devices (PaC) with PAA
   IP address before using it.  In general, statically configuring
   parameters on every device for their currently attached subnet or
   network does not scale as the number of devices grow.

   This document proposes a simple method of dynamically discovering the
   PAA.  A simple and independent discovery protocol can be installed on
   the PaC and PAA devices that will allow PaC to pro-actively discover
   the PAA by sending a link local multicast message, PANA-Agent-
   Discover-Request (PDR).  In this case, the PAA listening on that
   multicast address, can issue a corresponding answer sent unicast to
   the PaC.  The PaC determines the PAA IP address from the source IP of
   the answer to the PDR message.


2.  Terminology

   This document reuses the terminology used in PANA.


3.  PAA Discovery Details

   A PaC device wishing to actively discover a PAA can immediately send
   a PDR message.  The PDR is sent as a PANA message with a source IP
   address set to the PaC IP address and the destination IP address set
   to a well known multicast address 224.0.0.[TBD].  The PDR MUST be
   sent to the well known PANA port [TBD] and the PaC device MUST be
   prepared to accept message on the source port it sets in the PDRs UDP
   header.

   A PAA device which supports the PAA discovery protocol MUST be
   prepared to accept messages at the well known PANA port and multicast
   address.  If a PDR message is received, the PAA device MUST issue a
   unicast PANA-Agent-Discover-Answer (PDA) message with the source IP
   address set to the PAA IP address and destination IP address set to
   the PaC IP address learned from the PDR message.  It MUST also set
   the destination port of the PDA to the source port of the PDR.  A PAA
   device which reponds to a PDR MAY initiate the PANA session since it
   has knowledge of the PaC IP address, See Section 4.1 of PANA.

   When a PaC device receives a PDA, it SHOULD use the source IP address
   as the IP address of the PAA in the subsequent PANA exchanges.  If

   the PaC device receives multiple PDA from different PAAs, it can make
   a local policy decision on which PAA IP address to use.


4.  Message Formats

   All message formats are taken from Sec 6 and 7 of the PANA base
   protocol document.  Message types are allocated using rules in Sec
   10.2.1 of the PANA base protocol document.  As of this writing, there
   are no AVPs associated with any of the discovery protocol messages.
   All messages MUST set both the session identifier and the sequence
   numbers in the PANA header to zero(0).

4.1.  PANA-Agent-Discover-Request

   The PANA-Agent-Discover-Request (PDR) message is sent by the PaC
   device.  The message MUST have the 'R' (Request) bit set in the PANA
   message header.

   Message Format

   PANA-Agent-Discover-Request ::= < PANA-Header: 5,REQ >
                                   *[ AVP ]

                   Figure 1: PANA-Agent-Discover-Request

4.2.  PANA-Agent-Discover-Answer

   The PANA-Agent-Discover-Answer (PDA) message is sent by the PAA
   device in response to a PANA-Agent-Discover-Request.  The message
   MUST NOT have the 'R' (Request) bit set in the PANA message header.

   Message Format

   PANA-Agent-Discover-Answer ::= < PANA-Header: 5 >
                                  * [ AVP ]
