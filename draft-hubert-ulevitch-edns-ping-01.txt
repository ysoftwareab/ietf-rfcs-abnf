Internet-Draft   EDNS Option for performing a data PING       April 2009


2.  Introduction

   This document describes an EDNS option that can be used to ask a
   remote nameserver, be it authoritative or a caching resolver, to copy
   an opaque string from the query to the response.

   This string can be used to verify proper transmission of DNS
   questions and responses of various sizes.

   Additionally, implementations could utilise EDNS PING as a way to
   enhance the security of DNS over UDP.

3.  Protocol

   This document uses an EDNS [RFC2671] option to signal that the remote
   nameserver must copy this option, and its payload, from the query to
   the response, without truncation or modification.

3.1.  Nameserver Behaviour

   A name server that understands the PING option and chooses to honor a
   particular PING request MUST respond by including the opaque payload
   in a PING option in an EDNS OPT pseudo-RR in the response message.

   The PING response should be included in addition to the records that
   would be returned if no PING request were included.

   An oversized payload MUST be ignored.

3.2.  Resolver Behaviour

   Resolvers, including stub resolvers, can signal their desire for an
   EDNS PING response by adding a PING option in an EDNS OPT pseudo-RR
   in the question message.

   The resolver is free to choose a length for the opaque payload of the
   PING option request, but care should be taken not to exceed
   acceptable DNS packet size limits.

   Malformed or truncated responses should be treated as suspicicous.
   Empty responses, however, may simply indicate a response from a
   nameserver which does not support EDNS PING responses.

3.3.  The PING option

   The OPTION-CODE for the PING option is 5.

   The OPTION-DATA for the PING option is an opaque byte string, the
   semantics of which are deliberately left outside of this document.

   The minimum length of the OPTION-DATA is 4 bytes, the maximum length
   is 16 bytes.

3.4.  Presentation format

   The presentation format of the PING option is left outside the scope
   of the protocol.  It should be observed that the payload of the PING
   option is completely arbitrary, and need not be null-terminated, and
   in general will not be.

4.  Discussion

   The PING option is modeled on ICMP ECHO-REQUEST and ECHO-RESPONSE
   packets ([RFC0792]), and can in fact be used in a similar manner to
   verify connectivity.

   An example of such verification is to determine the maximum response
   size that arrives unscathed.

   In addition, a resolver is free to append a PING option to outgoing
   queries in order to protect itself from accepting false data by
   requesting a more clearly marked response.  Such a PING-adorned
   response can clearly be separated from responses sent by third
   parties.

4.1.  Truncation

   In some cases, adding the PING option to a response message may
   trigger message truncation.  This specification does not change the
   rules for DNS message truncation in any way, but implementers will
   need to pay attention to this issue.

   Implementations claiming conformance to this draft, and which are
   configured to honor PING requests MUST respond to such requests, and
   must not drop the PING response to prevent truncation.

   By definition, a resolver that requests PING responses also supports
   EDNS, so a resolver that requests PING responses can also use the
   "sender's UDP payload size" field of the OPT pseudo-RR to signal a
   receive buffer size large enough to make truncation unlikely.

5.  Possible Uses and Implementation Guidance

   While this document standardizes how the EDNS PING option can be
   used, it does not specify how or when it should be used.

   In this non-normative section, guidance is given how this option
   might best be used to achieve certain effects.  It is expected that
   this guidance will be supplanted by the experience of implementors
   over time.

   In case the EDNS-PING option is used to protect against the spoofing
   of DNS answers, care must be taken that the payload of the EDNS-PING
   is sufficiently long and sufficiently unpredictable to serve this
   purpose.

   Proper unpredictability can be achieved by employing a high quality
   (pseudo-)random generator, as described in [RFC4086].

   Not all servers support EDNS Options, nor do all servers respond well
   to EDNS queries per se.  Like EDNS in general, care must be taken to
   determine if a nameserver responds well to EDNS-PING adorned queries.

   If the state of a remote server's support for EDNS-PING is cached,
   and EDNS-PING is used to protect against spoofing, it is imperative
   that such state can not be downgraded within a reasonable timeframe.

6.  Security Considerations

   While EDNS PING might be used to enhance the security of query/
   response correlation, in and of itself it is not expected to have
   security implications.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is expected and requested to reserve option 5 for EDNS PING.

8.  Acknowledgments

   Donald Eastlake first discussed the concept of DNS cookies
   ([I-D.eastlake-dnsext-cookies]), which are remarkably similar to EDNS
   PING requests, but cover a wider scope and have a defined purpose.

   Most of this document was copied almost verbatim from [RFC5001] which
   implements a very similar EDNS option, used for very different
   purposes.  Thanks are due to Rob Austein and other contributors to
   the NSID RFC.

   Although any mistakes remain our own, the authors gratefully
   acknowledge the help and contributions of:
