      The Effect of Multicast on Virtual Nodes in the Same Subnet
             draft-elkins-v6ops-multicast-virtual-nodes-00


Abstract

   When network administrators in an end-user enterprise create subnets
   for Virtual Machines (VMs) in IPv6, they are not considering what
   will happen with IPv6 multicast.  We will describe how one node can
   impact its neighbors.  For example, multicast Ping Denial of Service
   (DoS) attacks and other mischief can easily be done.

1 Introduction

   When network administrators in an end-user enterprise create subnets
   for Virtual Machines (VMs) in IPv6, they are not considering what
   will happen with IPv6 multicast.   "IPv4 thinking" may be done in
   that addresses are rationed.

   We will describe how one node can impact its neighbors.  For example,
   multicast Ping Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and other mischief can
   easily be done.

   How Neigbor Discovery may impact IPv6 subnets was covered in
   "Operational Neighbor Discovery Problems [RFC6583].

   From [RFC6583]:

   "In IPv4, subnets are generally small, made just large enough to
   cover the actual number of machines on the subnet.  In contrast, the
   default IPv6 subnet size is a /64, a number so large it covers
   trillions of addresses, the overwhelming number of which will be
   unassigned.  Consequently, simplistic implementations of Neighbor
   Discovery (ND) can be vulnerable to deliberate or accidental denial
   of service (DoS), whereby they attempt to perform address resolution
   for large numbers of unassigned addresses.  Such denial-of-service
   attacks can be launched intentionally (by an attacker) or result from
   legitimate operational tools or accident conditions."

1.1 Terminology

   From "Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)" [RFC4861], we have:

   neighbors  - nodes attached to the same link.

   interface  - a node's attachment to a link.

   link  - a communication facility or medium over which nodes can
   communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer immediately below IP. 
   Examples are Ethernets (simple or bridged), PPP links, X.25, Frame
   Relay, or ATM networks as well as Internet-layer (or higher-layer)


2 Who is a Neighbor and Why Does it Matter?

   A neighbor is anyone that you can talk to with a link-local address.
   When you have a very large subnet, it can be a great many nodes,
   indeed.

   IPv6 multicast packets are seen by nodes who are "on-link".   Again,
   this may be a great many neighbors.


3 Sample Real Situation

   We got two IPv6 enabled virtual servers from a commercial hosting
   company.   One was a Windows server.  The other, a Linux server. The
   addresses we received for the Windows server were:

   Here are the IPs:

   nnnn:abcd:123::31da:4b3b
   nnnn:abcd:123::df8d:8198
   nnnn:abcd:123::797e:5ec

INTERNET DRAFT  elkins-v6ops-multicast-virtual-nodes-00   September 2014


   nnnn:abcd:123::6512:b2c3
   nnnn:abcd:123::2563:4d17
   nnnn:abcd:123::30b2:7a05
   nnnn:abcd:123::9d90:8e24
   nnnn:abcd:123::9ada:3f3c
   nnnn:abcd:123::bf53:d3d3
   nnnn:abcd:123::4515:bc5e


   They told us that the gateway is nnnn:abcd:123::1.  The subnet is a
   /64.

   On the Linux machine, we received:

   nnnn:abcd:123::3fed:2e56
   nnnn:abcd:123::90bf:fb81
   nnnn:abcd:123::5d40:cb6e
   nnnn:abcd:123::bc8:512a
   nnnn:abcd:123::d93b:164c
   nnnn:abcd:123::f4fd:4c9c
   nnnn:abcd:123::91dc:f23
   nnnn:abcd:123::4c5d:6ac8
   nnnn:abcd:123::6170:ec48
   nnnn:abcd:123::bfd9:b68a

   Again, they told us that the gateway is nnnn:abcd:123::1.  The subnet
   is a /64.

   Clearly both sets of addresses were in the same IPv6 subnet thus
   "neighbors" in a link-local sense. The hosting companies policy for
   global unicast address allocation appears to be random.  At least,
   the allocations were not via an algorithm that was readily apparent
   to us.

   Clearly, also, these machines were virtual servers.  That is, not
   real physical nodes.

   We feel that this situation illustrates a scenario causing a number
   of problems that are likely to happen when IPv6 addresses start being
   allocated at end user enterprise sites.


3.1 Ping to FF02::1

   When we did a Ping to FF02::1 (multicast all nodes), we were able to
   impact an entirely separate virtual server. By the way, we also
   impacted all the other clients of that hosting company.  (We only did
   this once or twice for proof of concept!)

3.2 Our Test

   The command we issued was:

   Ping FF02::1 -n 10

   The result was:

   Pinging ff02::1 with 32 bytes of data:
   Reply from ff02::1: time=6ms
   Reply from ff02::1: time=2ms
   Reply from ff02::1: time=3ms
   Reply from ff02::1: time=2ms
   Reply from ff02::1: time=4ms
   Reply from ff02::1: time=3ms
   Reply from ff02::1: time=2ms
   Reply from ff02::1: time=2ms
   Reply from ff02::1: time=2ms
   Reply from ff02::1: time=2ms

   Ping statistics for ff02::1:
       Packets: Sent = 10, Received = 10, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
   Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
       Minimum = 2ms, Maximum = 6ms, Average = 2ms



   We did a WireShark packet trace at the same time.  We could see that
   indeed Pings and Ping replies were done.  Neighbor discovery packets
   were done as well.

   In fact, this is what we see:

   ICMP Type   Packet                     Number
   ------------------------------------------------
      128    Echo Request                    10
      129    Echo Reply                   2,840
      135    Neighbor Solicitation          578
      136    Neighbor Advertisement         568

   In a second test, when we sent 4 packets for the Ping request, we
   see:

   ICMP Type    Packet                     Number
   ------------------------------------------------
      128  Echo Request                         4
      129  Echo Reply                       1,140
      135  Neighbor Solicitation              574

INTERNET DRAFT  elkins-v6ops-multicast-virtual-nodes-00   September 2014


      136  Neighbor Advertisement             570
      143  V2 Multicast Listener Report         4


   What was happening is that the Echo Replies were coming from all our
   neighbors.  To confirm what we are seeing, we interrogated the
   neighbor cache before and after the commands.   The neighbor cache
   had 4 unicast addresses before the Ping. After the Ping, the neighbor
   cache has grown to 127 unicast addresses.  This confirms what we see
   with the packet trace.

   See Appendix A for results of the neighbor cache.

   So, it is clear that one virtual node on an IPv6 subnet can impact
   others.   Potentially, all nodes on a subnet can be impacted.


3.3 Other packets generated to multicast addresses

   Clearly other packets can be generated to do Denial of Service
   attacks on virtual (and real) nodes, including MLD.   But, we
   consider this out of scope for this document.

4  Recommendations

4.1 Best Practices for Subnet Configuration / Address Allocation

   Guidance for how to allocate addresses and create subnets for Virtual
   Machines should be provided.

4.2 Should nodes respond to Ping to FF0x::1

   This question needs to be discussed.  Is there a need for this
   functionality?  Or should it be deprecated?


5 IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations.

6 Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.
