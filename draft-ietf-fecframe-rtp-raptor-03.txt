                   RTP Payload Format for Raptor FEC
                   draft-ietf-fecframe-rtp-raptor-03

Abstract

   This document specifies an RTP Payload Format for Forward Error
   Correction repair data produced by the Raptor FEC Schemes.  Raptor
   FEC Schemes are specified for use with the IETF FEC Framework which
   supports transport of repair data over both UDP and RTP.  This
   document specifies the Payload Format which is required for the use
   of RTP to carry Raptor repair flows.

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Fromat for Raptor           March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The FEC Framework [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] defines a general
   framework for the use of Forward Error Correction in association with
   arbitrary packet flows, including flows over UDP and RTP [RFC3550].
   Forward Error Corrections operates by generating redundant data
   packets ("repair data") which can be sent independently from the
   original flow.  At a receiver the original flow can be reconstructed
   provided a sufficient set of redundant data packets and possibly
   original data packets are received.

   The FEC Framework provides for independence between application
   protocols and FEC codes.  The use of a particular FEC code within the
   framework is defined by means of an FEC Scheme which may then be used
   with any application protocol compliant to the framework.

   Repair data flows may be sent directly over a transport protocol such
   as UDP, or they may be encapsulated within RTP.  In the latter case,
   an RTP Payload Format must be defined for each FEC Scheme.

   This document defines the RTP Payload Format for the Raptor FEC
   Schemes defined in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor].

3.  Media Format Background

   The Raptor and RaptorQ codes are efficient block-based fountain
   codes, meaning that from any group of source packets (or 'source
   block') an arbitrary number of repair packets may be generated.  The
   Raptor and RaptorQ codes have the property that the original group of
   source symbols can be recovered with very high probability from any
   set of symbols (source and repair) only slightly greater in number
   than the original number of source symbols.  The RaptorQ code
   additionally has the property that the probability that the original
   group of source symbols can be recovered from a set of symbols
   (source and repair) equal in number to the original number of source
   symbols is in many cases also very high.

   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor] defines six FEC Schemes for the use of the
   Raptor and RaptorQ codes with arbitary packet flows: the first two
   schemes are fully applicable to arbitary packet flows (using Raptor
   and RaptorQ respectively).  The third and fourth schemes are slightly
   optimised versions of the first two schemes which are applicable in
   applications with relatively small block sizes.  The fifth and sixth
   schemes are variants of the third and fourth schemes which are
   applicable to a single source flow which already has some kind of
   identifiable sequence number.  The presence of a sequence number in
   the source flow allows for backwards compatible operation (the source
   flows do not need to be modified in order to apply FEC).  In this
   case, in the language of the FEC Framework, there is no need for an
   explicit FEC Source Payload Id and it is therefore not included in
   the packets.

4.  Payload Format

4.1.  RTP Header Usage

   The following rules SHALL be followed for the RTP header used with
   FEC repair packets:

   o  Marker bit: The marker bit SHALL be set 1 for the last protection
      RTP packet sent for each source block, and otherwise set to 0

   o  Timestamp: The timestamp SHALL be set to a time corresponding to
      the packet's transmission time.  The timestamp value has no use in
      the actual FEC protection process.  It may be used for packet
      arrival timing and jitter calculations.  The timestamp rate SHALL
      be specified using the "rate" media type parameter defined below.

   Other header fields SHALL be set according to the rules of [RFC3550].

4.2.  Payload Header

   There is no Payload Header in this Payload Format

4.3.  Payload Data

   Procedures and data formats for the use of Raptor Forward Error
   Correction in an FECFRAME context are fully defined in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] and [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] and
   are not duplicated here.  The procedures of those documents SHALL be
   followed in order to generate repair data streams to be carried by
   the payload formats defined in this document.

   The RTP Payload SHALL contain an FEC Repair Payload as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework] and [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor].

7.  Mapping to SDP

   Applications that are using RTP transport commonly use Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] to describe their RTP sessions.
   The information that is used to specify the media types in an RTP
   session has specific mappings to the fields in an SDP description.
   Note that if an application does not use SDP to describe the RTP
   sessions, an appropriate mapping must be defined and used to specify
   the media types and their parameters for the control/description
   protocol employed by the application.

   The mapping of the above defined payload format media type and its
   parameters SHALL be done according to Section 3 of [RFC4855]
   following the suggestion therein regarding the mapping of payload-
   format-specific paraeters into the ""a=fmtp"" field.

   When the RTP Payload Formats defined in this document are used, the
   Media Type Parameters defined above SHALL be used to specify the FEC
   Framework Configuration Information in preference to the SDP
   attributes specified in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-sdp-elements]

8.  Offer/Answer considerations

   When offering Raptor FEC over RTP using SDP in an Offer/Answer model
   [RFC3264], the following considerations apply:

   o  Each combination of the Kmax and T parameters produces different
      FEC data and is not compatible with any other combination.  A
      sender application may desire to offer multiple offers with
      different sets of Kmax and T values as long as the parameter
      values are valid.  The receiver SHOULD normally choose the offer
      with the largest value of the product of Kmax and T that it
      supports.

   o  The size of the repair-window is related to the maximum delay
      between the transmission of a source packet and the associated
      repair packet.  This directly impacts the buffering requirement on
      the receiver side and the receiver must consider this when
      choosing an offer.

   o  When the P parameter is omitted, FEC Payload ID Format A MUST be
      assumed.  In an answer which selects an offer in which the P
      parameter was omitted, the P parameter MUST either be omitted, or
      included with value "A".

9.  Declarative SDP Considerations

   In declarative usage, like SDP in the Real-time Streaming Protocol
   (RTSP) [RFC2326] or the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
   [RFC2947], the following considerations apply:

   o  The payload format configuration parameters are all declarative
      and a participant MUST use the configuration that is provided for
      the session.

   o  More than one configuration may be provided (if desired) by
      declaring multiple RTP payload types.  In that case, the receivers
      should choose the repair flow that is best for them.

Internet-Draft        RTP Payload Fromat for Raptor           March 2010


10.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests that IANA registers application/raptorfec as
   specified in Section 6.1.1, video/raptorfec as specified in
   Section 6.2.1, audio/raptorfec as specified in Section 6.3.1 and
   text/raptorfec as specified in Section 6.4.1.  The media type is also
   requested to be added to the IANA registry for "RTP Payload Format
   MIME types" (http://www.iana.org/assignments/rtp-parameters).

11.  Security Considerations

   Security Considerations related to the use of the FEC Framework are
   addressed in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework].  These consideration
   apply in full to users of the RTP Payload Formats defined in this
   document, since these are defined in terms of the FEC Framework.

   No further security considerations related specifically to the Raptor
   FEC Schemes defined in [I-D.ietf-fecframe-raptor] have been
   identified.

   Users of RTP should consider the Security Considerations of
   [RFC3550].
