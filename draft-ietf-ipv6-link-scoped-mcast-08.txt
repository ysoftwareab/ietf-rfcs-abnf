Abstract

     This document specifies an extension to the multicast addressing
     architecture of the IPv6 protocol. The extension allows for the use
     of Interface Identifiers (IIDs) to allocate multicast addresses.
     When a link-local unicast address is configured at each interface
     of a node, an IID is uniquely determined.  After that, each node
     can generate their unique multicast addresses automatically without
     conflicts.  Basically, this document proposes an alternative method
     for creating link-local multicast addresses over a known method
     like unicast-prefix-based IPv6 multicast addresses. It is preferred
     to use this method for link-local scope rather than unicast-
     prefix-based IPv6 multicast addresses.  This memo update RFC3306.

1. Introduction

     This document defines an extension to the multicast portion of the
     IPv6 addressing architecture [RFC 3513]. The current architecture
     does not contain any built-in support for dynamic address
     allocation.  The extension allows for use of IIDs to allocate
     multicast addresses.  When a link-local unicast address is
     configured at each interface of a node, an IID is uniquely
     determined.  After that, each node can generate their unique
     multicast addresses automatically without conflicts.  That is,
     these addresses could safely be configured at any time after DAD
     (Duplicate Address Detection) has completed.

     Basically, it is preferred to use this method for the link-local
     scope rather than unicast-prefix-based IPv6 multicast addresses
     [RFC 3306].  This document restricts the usage of defined fields
     such as scop, plen and network prefix fields of [RFC 3306].
     Therefore, this document specifies encoded information for link-
     local scope in multicast addresses.

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
     "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
     this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].


2. Applicability

     The allocation technique in this document is designed to be used in
     any environment in which link-local scope IPv6 multicast addresses
     are assigned or selected.  Especially, this method goes well with
     nodes supplying multicast services in a zeroconf/serverless
     environment.  For example, multicast addresses less than or equal
     to link-local scope are themselves generated by nodes supplying
     multicast services without conflicts.  Also, hosts which are
     supplied multicast services from multicast servers then make
     multicast addresses of multicast servers using ND (address
     resolution) and well-known group IDs.

     Consequently, this technique MUST only be used for link scoped

     multicast addresses.  If you want to use multicast addresses
     greater than link-local scope, you need to use other methods as
     described in [RFC 3306].


3. Link Scoped Multicast Address Format

     This document specifies a new format that incorporates IID in the
     link-local scope multicast addresses.

     Figure 1 illustrates the new format for link scoped multicast
     addresses.

      |   8    |  4 |  4 |   8    |    8   |       64       |    32    |
      +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+
      |11111111|flgs|scop|reserved|  plen  |       IID      | group ID |
      +--------+----+----+--------+--------+----------------+----------+

           Figure 1: Link scoped multicast IPv6 address format

     Flgs, scop, and plen fields are used to identify whether an address
     is a multicast address as specified in this document as follows:
      1. flgs MUST be "0011".
      2. scop MUST be <= 2.
      3. The reserved field MUST be zero.
      4. "plen" field is a special value "1111 1111" (decimal 255).

     The IID field (replacing the 64-bit prefix field from [RFC 3306])
     is used to distinguish each node from others.  This value is
     obtained from the IEEE EUI-64 based interface identifier of the
     link-local unicast IPv6 address.  Given the use of this method for
     link-local scope, the IID embedded in the multicast address MUST
     only come from the IID of the link-local unicast address on the
     interface after DAD has completed.  That is, the creation of the
     multicast address MUST only occur after DAD has completed as part
     of the auto-configuration process.

     Group ID is generated to indicate a multicast application and is
     used to guarantee its uniqueness only in the host.  It may also be
     set on the basis of the guidelines outlined in [RFC 3307].


4. Example

     This is an example of link scoped IPv6 multicast addresses.  For
     example in an ethernet environment, if the link-local unicast
     address is FE80::A12:34FF:FE56:7890, the link scoped multicast
     prefix of the node is FF32:00FF:A12:34FF:FE56:7890::/96.


5. Consideration of Lifetime

INTERNET-DRAFT    Link Scoped IPv6 Multicast Addresses     December 2004


     Generally, Link scoped multicast addresses have no lifetime because
     link-local unicast addresses also have no lifetime.  But, it is not
     true in environment of mobile.  Even though multicast addresses are
     created from the unique IID of unicast address, their useful
     lifetime is linked to the period during which the IID is known to
     be unique.  Thus, it is possible to conflict between IIDs, due to a
     new node in merged network that uses the same IID as a powered
     node.

     This is a scenario where DAD also fails to guarantee the uniqueness
     of the unicast address, so this document does not try to address
     this issue.


6. Security Considerations

     The uniqueness of multicast addresses using this method is
     guaranteed by the DAD process.  So, it is needed to get a secure
     DAD process for stability of this method.  This document proposes
     the mechanism in [RFC 3041] for this purpose.

     [RFC 3041] describes the privacy extension to IPv6 stateless
     address autoconfiguration to how to configure the IID of non-link-
     local scope unicast addresses.  [RFC 3041] can not be used for
     making a link-local unicast address, and hence it cannot be used to
     create an IID for link-scoped multicast address. However, as [RFC
     3041] does not protect the privacy of link-local unicast addresses,
     it does not protect the privacy of link-local unicast addresses, it
     does not seem to be required to protect the privacy of IID-based
     link-local multicast addresses.
