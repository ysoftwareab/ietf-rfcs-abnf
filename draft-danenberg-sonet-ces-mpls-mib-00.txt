2  Introduction 
       
   This document describes a model for managing encapsulated time 
   division multiplexed (TDM) digital signals for transmission over a  
   packet-oriented MPLS network. 
    
   This document is closely related to [CEM], which describes a circuit 
   emulation header used to encapsulate TDM signals and provide the 
   Circuit Emulation Service over MPLS (CEM). This document is also 
   related to [TRANS and ENCAP], describing the transport and 
   encapsulation of Layer 2 circuits over MPLS, respectively. 
    
   The model for CEM management is a MIB. The CEM MIB described in this 
   document works closely with the MIBs described in [TEMIB and LSRMIB].

   Together, [TEMIB and LSRMIB], describe the modeling of an MPLS 
   Tunnel, and a Tunnel's underlying cross-connects. In the spirit of 
   the [IFMIB], a CEM connection will be a virtual connection (VC), and 
   will therefore not be represented in the ifTable.  
    
   There are functionalities introduced here that are not discussed in 
   [CEM, ENCAP, or TRANS]. So consider them as points of discussion for 
   now. For example, introduced here is the concept of switching CEM VCs

   between Primary and Backup MPLS Tunnels. Considering the speeds of 
   CEM VCs, there is likely a requirement for automatic protection 
   switching (APS) for tunnels carrying CEM traffic. CEM defects will be

   used as input to CEM APS decisions. It is for further study to use 
   other mechanisms for CEM APS (see draft-chang-mpls-path-protection-
   02.txt for other work in this area).

   Internet Draft            MPLS CEM MIB                February 2001 
    
   CEM dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) is also introduced in this 
   MIB. CEM DBA will send packets with only a CEM Header (i.e., no 
   payload) that will signal local conditions (such as AIS and un-
   equipped) when user traffic is not present. The remote CEM will play 
   out "canned" SONET payloads when DBA is signaled. 
    
   CEM is currently designed to carry SONET paths as a "structured" 
   adaptation (see Terminology). "Unstructured" CEM is for future 
   consideration. The CEM MIB will reference SONET paths as modeled 
   within [SONETMIB]. 
    
   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list at 
   mpls@uu.net. 
    
   This memo does not, in its draft form, specify a standard for the 
   Internet community. 
    
   Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 
   [BCP14]. 
    
3  Terminology 
 
   This document uses terminology from the document describing the 
   MPLS architecture [MPLSArch]. A Label Switched Path (LSP) is modeled 
   as described in [LSRMIB and TEMIB] via a series of cross-connects 
   through 1 or more Label switch routers (LSR). 
    
   CEM terminology comes from the CEM draft that describes a mechanism 
   for transporting time division multiplexed (TDM) digital signals 
   over a packet-oriented MPLS network. The mechanism outlined in the 
   CEM draft terminates the SONET section and line overhead and then 
   breaks the SONET path's Synchronous Payload Envelope (SPE) into 
   fragments for transmission over a packet-based network. A 32-bit TDM 
   header is appended at the beginning of each fragment to provide 
   information regarding where the SPE begins within the packet stream, 
   a sequence number, and pointer adjustment information. 
    
   "Adaptation" refers to the method of adapting a "foreign" 
   communications protocol such that it can be carried by a "native" 
   protocol. In this case, the foreign protocol is SONET/SDH and the 
   native protocol is MPLS. 
    
   "Outbound" references the traffic direction where a SONET path's 
   payload (SPE) is received, adapted to MPLS, assigned a VC label, and 
   sent into the MPLS network.   
    
   Conversely, "inbound" is the direction where packets are received 
   from the MPLS network, packet payloads are reassembled back into an 
   SPE, and inserted as a SONET path into the SONET section and line.

   Since A SONET path is bi-directional and symmetrical, it uses the 
   same SONET time-slot, SONET width, MPLS packet size, and VC Label for

   outbound and inbound traffic. 
    
   CEM will normally transmit into an originating "head" end of a Tunnel

   LSP, and receive from a terminating "tail" end a Tunnel LSP. A CEM 
   connection typically uses a VC (virtual connection) Label within a 
   Tunnel Label [TRANS]. Multiple CEM VCs each with a unique MPLS VC 
   Label and similar traffic engineering requirements can share the same

   MPLS Tunnel. For Layer 2 transport over MPLS, the Tunnel Label is 
   known as the "outer" Label, while the VC Label is known as the 
   "inner" Label. An exception to this is with adjacent LSRs. In this 
   case, there is an option for CEM VCs to connect directly without an 
   outer Label.  
    
   VCs can be configured to switch to a "Backup Tunnel". The active 
   Tunnel may be referred to as "In-service", while inactive Tunnels are

   "Standby". 
    
4  The SNMP Management Framework 
 
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
   components: 
    
   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [SNMPArch]. 
    
   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
   purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of 
   Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC 
   1155 [SMIv1], RFC 1212 [SNMPv1MIBDef] and RFC 1215 [SNMPv1Traps].  
   The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [SMIv2], 
   RFC 1903 [SNMPv2TC] and RFC 1904 [SNMPv2Conf]. 
    
   -  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The 
   first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
   described in RFC 1157 [SNMPv1].  A second version of the SNMP message

   protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is 
   called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [SNMPv2c] and RFC 1906 
   [SNMPv2TM].  The third version of the message protocol is called 
   SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [SNMPv2TM], RFC 2272 [SNMPv3MP] and 
   RFC 2574 [SNMPv3USM]. 
    
   -  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The 
   first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
   described in RFC 1157 [SNMPv1].  A second set of protocol operations 
   and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [SNMPv2PO]. 
    
   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 
   [SNMPv3App] and the view-based access control mechanism described in 
   RFC 2575 [SNMPv3VACM].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. This memo specifies 
   a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A MIB conforming to the 
   SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate translations. The 
   resulting translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except 
   where objects or events are omitted because no translation is 
   possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-readable information in 
   SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the

   translation process.  However, this loss of machine-readable 
   information is not considered to change the semantics of the MIB. 
    
4.1  Object Definitions 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) 
   defined in the SMI. In particular, each object type is named by an 
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object type

   together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a 
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we 
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to 
   the object type. 
    
5  Feature Checklist 
    
   The Circuit Emulation over MPLS MIB (CEM-MIB) is designed to satisfy 
   the following requirements and constraints: 
    
   - The MIB supports manually configured CEM VCs. Although, the VC ID 
   parameters needed for LDP are contained within this MIB. Adaptation 
   circuits (like CEM VCs) configured via any MPLS signaling protocol 
   are for future study. 
    
   - The MIB supports point-to-point CEM connections. Point-to-
   multipoint connections are for future study. 
    
   - The MIB establishes the adaptation connection by referencing the 
   SONET path (within the ifTable [IFMIB]) to be adapted, the VC (inner)

   Label, and the two Tunnels [TEMIB] that carry the bi-directional 
   SONET path. 
    
   - The MIB configures the Tunnel and VCs: for Tunnel APS. 
    
   - The MIB configures the connection: name, packet length, error 
   actions, etc.  
    
   - The MIB reports: operational state, packet counts, error counts, 
   etc.

6.1  How Tunnels and Segments work with CEM 
    
   The following sections do not cover setting up a full connection 
   across an MPLS network. They cover the configuration of the edge LSR 
   - that is to say, the LSR providing the CEM function. Since Tunnels 
   are uni-directional, a pair of Tunnels must be configured (one for 
   inbound, one for outbound). The following graphic depicts a CEM VC 
   that originates and terminates at LSR-M. It uses LSPs A and B formed 
   by Tunnels Ax and Bx continuing through LSR-N to LSR-P. The 
   concatenations of Tunnels create the LSPs. Note: since the CEM cross-
   connects terminate and originate at LSR-M, the in and out segments 
   are not in tandem pairs (as they are in the transit LSR-N), this is 
   per [LSRMIB]. Note: 'X' denotes a Tunnel's cross-connect.

6.2  Summary of CEM MIB 
       
   - The CEM SONET extension (mplsCemSonetPathExtTable) is used to 
   indicate the time slot of the SONET path to be adapted. 
    
   - The CEM VC Table (mplsCemVcTable) is used for associating a SONET 
   path with a pair of MPLS Tunnels (inbound and outbound). Its many 
   objects are used to control VCs. 
    
   - The CEM Performance Table (mplsCemVcPerfTable) is an augmentation 
   of the mplsCemVcTable and contains many objects for monitoring VCs.  
    
   - The CEM Mapping Table (mplsCemMappingTable) is used to map the 
   inbound Tunnel and VC Label to the Circuit ID. The Circuit ID is the 
   index to an entry in the mplsCemVcTable. 
    
   - The Tunnel Extension Table (mplsCemTunnelExtTable) is used to 
   configure any Tunnel switchover parameters.

   - The Tunnel Extension Performance Table (mplsCemTunnelExtPerfTable) 
   is used to monitor indications not available in the 
   mplsTunnelPerfTable. 
    
6.3  CEM configuration Step by Step 
    
   Configuring a CEM VC and a pair of Tunnels (at LSR-M) involves the 
   following steps. 
    
   First configure the Tunnels and their cross-connects: 
    
   - Follow steps as defined in [TEMIB] to configure a Tunnel. 
    
   - Follow steps as defined in [LSRMIB] to set up the outbound cross-
   connect for that Tunnel. As this is the Tunnel origination (head-
   end), the cross-connect will not reference an InSegment and the 
   ingress LSR ID will be set to that of the local (edge) LSR.  
    
   - Set up the inbound cross-connect per [LSRMIB]. As this is the 
   Tunnel termination (tail-end), the cross-connect will not reference 
   an OutSegment and the egress LSR ID will be set to that of the local 
   (edge) LSR. 
    
    
   Configure the SONET parameters: 
    
   - Set the SONET path width in the sonetPathCurrentTable [SONETMIB]. 
    
   - Set the SONET path starting time slot in the 
   mplsCemSonetPathExtTable. 
    
    
   Configure the CEM VC: 
    
   - Create an entry in the mplsCemVcTable. The first index is obtained 
   from the agent, the second is the VC instance. (Note: there may be 
   multiple instances of an mplsCemVcTable entry for use with Backup 
   Tunnels.) Now bind this entry to the SONET ifIndex [SONETMIB], the VC

   Label, and the inbound and outbound tunnels [TEMIB] by setting those 
   objects.  
    
   - Set other parameters in the mplsCemVcTable (packet length, etc.). 
    
   - Although MPLS signaling of CEM is outside the scope of this 
   document, LDP parameters are defined in the mplsCemVcTable: VC ID 
   length, VC group ID, and optional VC parameters (the VC Circuit ID 
   can be the mplsCemVcTable index, the VC Type for CEM is specified in 
   [TRANS]). 
    
   - Use the VC Label to create an entry in the mplsCemMappingTable. 
   This table is indexed by the inbound Tunnel's indexes plus the VC 
   Label. It associates the inbound Tunnel and VC Label to the 
   mplsCemVcTable entry.

   Internet Draft            MPLS CEM MIB                February 2001 
    
    
   - Once a CEM VC is operational, the mplsCemVcPerfTable is used to 
   monitor the various counts, indicators, and conditions of the VC. 
    
    
   Advanced CEM configuration (mplsCemVcTable and 
   mplsCemTunnelExtTable): 
    
   - VC backup. In the mplsCemVcTable, as part of CEM APS, set the 
   criteria for switching this VC to the Backup Tunnel.  
    
   - Tunnel Table. In the mplsCemTunnelExtTable, an entry is created 
   here for each entry in the mplsCemMappingTable. This 
   mplsCemTunnelExtTable table is indexed with the same indexes as the 
   inbound Tunnel [TEMIB].  
    
   - Tunnel Backup. As with VC backup, there are objects for setting 
   Tunnel Backup switchover criteria. For Tunnels, they are in the 
   mplsCemTunnelExtTable. An entry is created in this table by the agent

   for every entry in the mplsCemMappingTable, and is indexed as the 
   inbound Tunnel is indexed [TEMIB]. Backup Tunnel switchovers will 
   switch all VCs in bulk. It is for this reason that care must be taken

   if Tunnel Backup and VC Backup mechanisms are both configured. 
    
   Note: CEM VCs are always configured with a pair of Tunnels (inbound 
   and outbound). When a second set of CEM VC and Backup Tunnel is 
   configured, then there will be a total of 4 Tunnels involved. To 
   reduce complexities, it is recommended to design the agent's APS 
   mechanism to switch completely from one CEM VC/Tunnel set to another.

   For example, do not use an inbound Primary Tunnel with an outbound 
   Backup Tunnel. To mix Primary and Backup Tunnels is for future study.

    
7  Example of CEM Setup 
    
   In this section we provide an example of using the MIB objects 
   described in section 8 to set up a CEM VC. While this example is not 
   meant to illustrate every permutation of the MIB, it is intended as 
   an aid to understanding some of the key concepts. It is meant to be 
   read after going through the MIB itself. See [LSRMIB] and [TEMIB] for

   an example of setting up Tunnels, their segments and cross-connects. 
    
   First configure the SONET path width, starting time-slot, and 
   associated CEM VC. In this case, an STS-3c starts at SONET time slot 
   1 (and is evenly distributed within the SONET frame). The ifIndex for

   both the sonetPathCurrentEntry and mplsCemSonetPathExtTable is 23. 
    
   In sonetPathCurrentEntry: 
   { 
      sonetPathCurrentWidth           = 3, 
      sonetPathCurrentStatus 
      ... 
      ... 
   }

      mplsCemSonetPathExtVcIndex      = 1 
      mplsCemSonetPathExtTimeSlot     = 1 
   } 
    
   Then create a CEM configuration entry in mplsCemVcTable. The indexes 
   are Index and Instance. Set PathIfIndex and VcLabel. The tunnel

   Now make the association of the inbound Tunnel and VC Label to the 
   mplsCemVcTable entry. The Tunnel Index, Instance, Ingress & Local LSR

   IDs, and VC Label are the 5 indexes for this table. Since the inbound

   Tunnel terminates here, its egress LSR ID should be that of the local

   (edge) LSR. Creating an entry in this table causes a corresponding 
   entry to be made in the mplsCemTunnelExt and mplsCemTunnelExtPerf 
   tables.

   Now configure the Tunnel extension table. It has the same indexes as 
   the mplsTunnelTable entry for the inbound Tunnel. An entry in this 
   table was created automatically when the mplsCemMapping table entry 
   was created.

7.1  Backup Tunnels 
    
   At this time, the type of APS supported by Backup Tunnels is for uni-
   directional protection switching. The approach used here supports 1+1

   switching where APS decisions are made on the inbound ("sink") side 
   based on CEM errors. Since CEM packets are emitted at regular 
   intervals and contain sequence numbers, failures can be detected 
   quickly and reliably. 
    
   An area for further study is 1:1 switching - normally this requires a

   backward defect indication. However, this may be accomplished by 
   forcing an upstream error, when downstream errors occur. In other 
   words, when the sink side sees CEM errors and switches to standby, it

   could turn off its outbound packet stream, thereby forcing remote CEM

   errors, and causing the remote to also switch to standby. Also for 
   further study is obtaining failure indications from other than CEM 
   errors (e.g., OAM).

   If Backup Tunnels are desired, they should be configured in the 
   mplsTunnelTable [TEMIB]. They MUST be configured in this table as 
   entries using the same mplsTunnelIndex primary index, but with 
   unique mplsTunnelInstances as secondary indexes. This will result in 
   the tunnel instances being configured in a group. It is also 
   important to note that these secondary entries may contain different 
   LSR IDs, as well as different corresponding tunnelHopTable, 
   tunnelARHopTable, and tunnelCHop entries. For example, if it were 
   desired to create a tunnel with one back up path, the 
   mplsTunnelTable would contain two entries with a primary index of 2. 
   Their two entries would have secondary indexes (mplsTunnelInstance) 
   of 5 and 8. Hence, there would be two entries: (2,5) and (2,8). The 
   secondary tunnel (2,8) should have a different cross-connect 
   (mplsTunnelXCPointer) as it should take a different path (i.e.: to 
   protect nodes or links) through the network to circumvent a network 
   failure. It should also be the case that the Tunnel Label differs 
   between both instances of the tunnel. 
    
   For a CEM VC to utilize a Backup Tunnel, there will be another 
   instance of the CEM VC within the mplsCemVcTable (forming a CEM VC 
   group). Each group member will have the same Index, PathIfIndex, and 
   VcLabel, but with a unique mplsCemVcInstance. Each CEM VC instance 
   will reference a different Tunnel (within a group of Tunnels). As 
   with the Tunnels, a primary CEM VC may be instance-1 while a backup 
   VC may be instance-2. 
    
   The switchover criteria in the mplsCemVc and mplsCemTunnelExt tables 
   control the switchover when groups of CEM VCs and Tunnels have been 
   configured. If the switchover is tunnel-based (that is, bulk VC 
   switchover is being employed), then the mplsCemVc switchover criteria

   should be none (and vice-versa). 
    
   Whether Tunnel Backup decisions are VC-based or tunnel-based, it is 
   the APS criterion that initiates switchover processing. The system 
   may then look for other Tunnels (within the group) that have no 
   failures (according to criteria). If a switchover is to occur and 
   there is more than one "good" Tunnel to switch to, then the Tunnel 
   and CEM VC instances are used to decide (lower instances have higher 
   priority). Things causing a bad tunnel are: administrative settings 
   (CEM VC or Tunnel admin down), CEM jitter buffer errors, CEM missing 
   packets, and CEM header errors (other criteria are for future study).

   The "revertive" setting can also initiate a switch. This parameter is

   useful for non-primary Tunnels where you may want to switch back to a

   Primary Tunnel even if the Backup Tunnel is OK. Finally there is 
   "hunt" mode for initiating switches in situations where the active 
   Tunnel is bad, but there are no defect indications available from the

   standby Tunnels. 
    
   APS timers: There is a timer for use with "revertive" to delay 
   switching back a Primary Tunnel once that Tunnel looks good. There is

   also a hold-off timer to delay switching from an active Tunnel once 
   it looks bad.

   It is possible that the bandwidth for a Backup Tunnel may be less 
   than that of the Primary Tunnel. In this case, when VCs are switched 
   over to the Backup, lower priority VCs may have to be dropped (set 
   dormant). The mplsCemVcPriority object is provided for this purpose. 
   Sorting and dropping is normally the responsibility the CAC 
   (connection admission control) function within an LSR. 
    
7.2  Adjacent LSRs 
    
   This section explains the how to configure CEM VCs that are connected

   via adjacent LSRs.  
    
   As [TRANS] points out, a VC label within a Tunnel label may not be 
   necessary in the Adjacent LSR case. To configure such a connection, 
   all the steps described above would be the same except when 
   configuring the OutSegment [LSRMIB]. In this case, PushTopLabel in 
   the [LSRMIB] object would be set false.

          "Bits set here represent defects and modes for switching

           this VC's  group. Defects include: CEM errors (jitter  
           buffer errors, missing packets, bad CEM headers). 
           Separating these CEM defects into individually selectable 
           bits, or adding other types of defect indications (e.g.  
           OAM status) is for future study.  
            
           Modes: 
           The 'cemErrorStbyOK' mode setting is useful in APS network  
           configurations where CEM traffic is not present on standby 
           inbound VCs. Therefore they are expected to have CEM  
           errors, but are still to be considered as viable switch- 
           over candidates. cemErrorStbyOK essentially masks CEM 
           errors when this CEM VC is in standby. 
            
           'revertive' mode is useful for non-preferred CEM VCs where  
           you may want to switch back to a preferred VC that has no  
           defects while the currently active VC also has no defects 
           (see mplsCemVcApsRevertTimer). 'revertive' should NOT be 
           used when standby VCs have no defect indications available. 
           If 'revertive' is not set, then manual reversion is possible

           by simply setting the active CEM VC's admin status 'down', 
           then 'up'. Preferred should NOT have 'revertive' set. 
            
           'hunt' mode is useful when standby VCs offer no defect 
           indications (see mplsCemVcApsHoldOffTimer). 'hunt' should 
           not be used when standby VCs have available defect 
           indications. Hunting assumes standby VCs are good, if not 
           the down timers will determine it's bad, and hunting 
           continues. 
            
           'hunt' and 'revertive' are mutually exclusive."

           errors, header errors, etc.) is for future study. Also, 
           for future study: determining a Tunnel's state of 
           usefulness via other indications (such as OAM). 
            
           If 'cemVcCriteria' is set, mplsCemTunnelExtApsViaCemVc 
           is used to index the CEM VC for which defects are 
           included. The purpose of this is in situations when 
           CEM VCs can generate better defects than Tunnels (for 
           example: buffer errors).  
            
           Revertive and Hunt modes: 
           'revertive' is useful for non-primary Tunnels where you 
           may want to switch back to a primary Tunnel that has no  
           defects while the currently active also has no defects  
           (see mplsCemTunnelExtApsRevertTimer). 'revertive' should  
           NOT be used when standby Tunnels have no available defect 
           indications. If 'revertive' is not set, then manual  
           reversion is possible by simply setting the active 
           Tunnel's admin status 'down', then 'up'. 
            
           'hunt' is useful when standby Tunnels offer no defect 
           indications (see mplsCemTunnelExtApsHoldOffTimer). 
           'hunt' should not be used when standby Tunnels have  
           available defect indications. Hunting assumes standby 
           Tunnels are good, if not the down timers will determine 
           it's bad, and hunting continues. 
    
            
           'hunt' and 'revertive' are mutually exclusive.
