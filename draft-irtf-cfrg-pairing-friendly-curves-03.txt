1.  Introduction

1.1.  Pairing-Based Cryptography

   Elliptic curve cryptography is one of the important areas in recent
   cryptography.  The cryptographic algorithms based on elliptic curve
   cryptography, such as ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
   Algorithm), are widely used in many applications.

Internet-Draft           Pairing-Friendly Curves              March 2020


   Pairing-based cryptography, a variant of elliptic curve cryptography,
   has attracted the attention for its flexible and applicable
   functionality.  Pairing is a special map defined over elliptic
   curves.  Thanks to the characteristics of pairing, it can be applied
   to construct several cryptographic algorithms and protocols such as
   identity-based encryption (IBE), attribute-based encryption (ABE),
   authenticated key exchange (AKE), short signatures and so on.
   Several applications of pairing-based cryptography are now in
   practical use.

   As the importance of pairing grows, elliptic curves where pairing is
   efficiently computable are studied and the special curves called
   pairing-friendly curves are proposed.

1.2.  Applications of Pairing-Based Cryptography

   Several applications using pairing-based cryptography are
   standardized and implemented.  We show example applications available
   in the real world.

   IETF publishes RFCs for pairing-based cryptography such as Identity-
   Based Cryptography [RFC5091], Sakai-Kasahara Key Encryption (SAKKE)
   [RFC6508], and Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE)
   [RFC6539].  SAKKE is applied to Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY)
   [RFC6509] and used in 3GPP [SAKKE].

   Pairing-based key agreement protocols are standardized in ISO/IEC
   [ISOIEC11770-3].  In [ISOIEC11770-3], a key agreement scheme by Joux
   [Joux00], identity-based key agreement schemes by Smart-Chen-Cheng
   [CCS07] and by Fujioka-Suzuki-Ustaoglu [FSU10] are specified.

   MIRACL implements M-Pin, a multi-factor authentication protocol
   [M-Pin].  M-Pin protocol includes a kind of zero-knowledge proof,
   where pairing is used for its construction.

   Trusted Computing Group (TCG) specifies ECDAA (Elliptic Curve Direct
   Anonymous Attestation) in the specification of Trusted Platform
   Module (TPM) [TPM].  ECDAA is a protocol for proving the attestation
   held by a TPM to a verifier without revealing the attestation held by
   that TPM.  Pairing is used for constructing ECDAA.  FIDO Alliance
   [FIDO] and W3C [W3C] also published ECDAA algorithm similar to TCG.

   Intel introduces Intel Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID) which enables
   remote attestation of a hardware device while preserving the privacy
   of the device as a functionality of Intel Software Guard Extensions
   (SGX) [EPID].  They extend TPM ECDAA to realize such functionality.
   A pairing-based EPID has been proposed [BL10] and distributed along
   with Intel SGX applications.

   Zcash implements their own zero-knowledge proof algorithm named zk-
   SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of
   Knowledge) [Zcash]. zk-SNARKs is used for protecting privacy of
   transactions of Zcash.  They use pairing for constructing zk-SNARKS.

   Cloudflare introduces Geo Key Manager [Cloudflare] to restrict
   distribution of customers' private keys to the subset of their data
   centers.  To achieve this functionality, attribute-based encryption
   is used and pairing takes a role as a building block.  In addition,
   Cloudflare published a new cryptographic library CIRCL[CIRCL]
   (Cloudflare Interoperable, Reusable Cryptographic Library) in 2019.
   They plan for supporting secure pairing-friendly curves in CIRCL.

   Recently, Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) signature schemes are being
   standardized [I-D.boneh-bls-signature] and utilized in several
   blockchain projects such as Ethereum [Ethereum], Algorand [Algorand],
   Chia Network [Chia] and DFINITY [DFINITY].  The aggregation
   functionality of BLS signatures is effective for their applications
   of decentralization and scalability.

1.3.  Goal

   The goal of this memo is to consider the security of pairing-friendly
   curves used in pairing-based cryptography and introduce secure
   parameters of pairing-friendly curves.  Specifically, we explain the
   recent attack against pairing-friendly curves and how much the
   security of the curves is reduced.  We show how to evaluate the
   security of pairing-friendly curves and give the parameters for 100
   bits of security, which is no longer secure, 128, 192 and 256 bits of
   security.

1.4.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Preliminaries

2.1.  Elliptic Curve

   Let p > 3 be a prime and q = p^n for a natural number n.  Let F_q be
   a finite field.  The curve defined by the following equation E is
   called an elliptic curve.

      E : y^2 = x^3 + A * x + B,



Sakemi, et al.          Expires 28 September 2020               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           Pairing-Friendly Curves              March 2020


   where x and y are in F_q, and A and B in F_q satisfy the discriminant
   inequality 4 * A^3 + 27 * B^2 != 0 mod q.  This is called Weierstrass
   normal form of an elliptic curve.

   Solutions (x, y) for an elliptic curve E, as well as the point at
   infinity, O_E, are called F_q-rational points.  If P and Q are two
   points on the curve E, we can define R = P + Q as the opposite point
   of the intersection between the curve E and the line that passes
   through P and Q.  We can define P + O_E = P = O_E + P as well.
   Similarly, we can define 2P = P + P and a scalar multiplication S =
   [a]P for a positive integer a can be defined as an (a-1)-time
   addition of P.

   The additive group, denoted by E(F_q), is constructed by the set of
   F_q-rational points and the addition law described above.  We can
   define the cyclic additive group with a prime order r by taking a
   base point BP in E(F_q) as a generator.  This group is used for the
   elliptic curve cryptography.

   We define terminology used in this memo as follows.

   O_E:  the point at infinity over an elliptic curve E.

   E(F_q):  a group constructed by F_q-rational points of E.

   #E(F_q):  the number of F_q-rational points of E.

   h:  a cofactor such that h = #E(F_q) / r.

2.2.  Pairing

   Pairing is a kind of the bilinear map defined over two elliptic
   curves E and E'.  Examples include Weil pairing, Tate pairing,
   optimal Ate pairing [Ver09] and so on.  Especially, optimal Ate
   pairing is considered to be efficient to compute and mainly used for
   practical implementation.

   Let E be an elliptic curve defined over a prime field F_p and E' be
   an elliptic curve defined over an extension field of F_p.  Let k be a
   minimum integer such that r is a divisor of p^k - 1, which is called
   an embedding degree.  Let G_1 be a cyclic subgroup on the elliptic
   curve E with order r, and G_2 be a cyclic subgroup on the elliptic
   curve E' with order r.  Let G_T be an order r subgroup of a
   multiplicative group (F_p^k)^*.

   Pairing is defined as a bilinear map e: (G_1, G_2) -> G_T satisfying
   the following properties:

Internet-Draft           Pairing-Friendly Curves              March 2020


   1.  Bilinearity: for any S in G_1, T in G_2, and integers a and b,
       e([a]S, [b]T) = e(S, T)^{a * b}.

   2.  Non-degeneracy: for any T in G_2, e(S, T) = 1 if and only if S =
       O_E.  Similarly, for any S in G_1, e(S, T) = 1 if and only if T =
       O_E.

   3.  Computability: for any S in G_1 and T in G_2, the bilinear map is
       efficiently computable.

2.3.  Barreto-Naehrig Curve

   A BN curve [BN05] is one of the instantiations of pairing-friendly
   curves proposed in 2005.  A pairing over BN curves constructs optimal
   Ate pairings.

   A BN curve is defined by elliptic curves E and E' parameterized by a
   well chosen integer t.  E is defined over F_p, where p is a prime
   more than or equal to 5, and E(F_p) has a subgroup of prime order r.
   The characteristic p and the order r are parameterized by

       p = 36 * t^4 + 36 * t^3 + 24 * t^2 + 6 * t + 1
       r = 36 * t^4 + 36 * t^3 + 18 * t^2 + 6 * t + 1

   for an integer t.

   The elliptic curve E has an equation of the form E: y^2 = x^3 + b,
   where b is an element of multiplicative group of order p.

   BN curves always have order 6 twists.  If m is an element which is
   neither a square nor a cube in an extension field F_p^2, the twisted
   curve E' of E is defined over an extension field F_p^2 by the
   equation E': y^2 = x^3 + b' with b' = b / m or b' = b * m.  BN curves
   are called D-type if b' = b / m, and M-type if b' = b * m.  The
   embedded degree k is 12.

   A pairing e is defined by taking G_1 as a subgroup of E(F_p) of order
   r, G_2 as a subgroup of E'(F_p^2), and G_T as a subgroup of a
   multiplicative group (F_p^12)^* of order r.

2.4.  Barreto-Lynn-Scott Curve

   A BLS curve [BLS02] is another instantiations of pairings proposed in
   2002.  Similar to BN curves, a pairing over BLS curves constructs
   optimal Ate pairings.

   A BLS curve is elliptic curves E and E' parameterized by a well
   chosen integer t.  E is defined over a finite field F_p by an



Sakemi, et al.          Expires 28 September 2020               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           Pairing-Friendly Curves              March 2020


   equation of the form E: y^2 = x^3 + b, and its twisted curve, E': y^2
   = x^3 + b', is defined in the same way as BN curves.  In contrast to
   BN curves, E(F_p) does not have a prime order.  Instead, its order is
   divisible by a large parameterized prime r and denoted by h * r with
   cofactor h.  The pairing will be defined on the r-torsions points.
   In the same way as BN curves, BLS curves can be categorized into
   D-type and M-type.

   BLS curves vary according to different embedding degrees.  In this
   memo, we deal with BLS12 and BLS48 families with embedding degrees 12
   and 48 with respect to r, respectively.

   In BLS curves, parameterized p and r are given by the following
   equations:

      BLS12:
          p = (t - 1)^2 * (t^4 - t^2 + 1) / 3 + t
          r = t^4 - t^2 + 1
      BLS48:
          p = (t - 1)^2 * (t^16 - t^8 + 1) / 3 + t
          r = t^16 - t^8 + 1

   for a well chosen integer t.

   A pairing e is defined by taking G_1 as a subgroup of E(F_p) of order
   r, G_2 as an order r subgroup of E'(F_p^2) for BLS12 and of E'(F_p^8)
   for BLS48, and G_T as an order r subgroup of a multiplicative group
   (F_p^12)^* for BLS12 and of a multiplicative group (F_p^48)^* for
   BLS48.

2.5.  Representation Convention for an Extension Field

   Pairing-friendly curves use a tower of some extension fields.  In
   order to encode an element of an extension field, focusing on
   interoperability, we adopt the representation convention shown in
   Appendix J.4 of [I-D.ietf-lwig-curve-representations] as a standard
   and effective method.

   Let F_p be a finite field of characteristic p and F_p^d be an
   extension field of F_p of degree d and an indeterminate i.

   For an element s in F_p^d such that s = s_0 + s_1 * i + ... + s_{d -
   1} *  i^{d - 1} for s_0, s_1, ... , s_{d - 1} in a basefield F_p, s
   is represented as octet string by oct(s) = s_0 || s_1 || ... || s_{d
   - 1}.

   Let F_p^d' be an extension field of F_p^d of degree d' / d and an
   indeterminate j.



Sakemi, et al.          Expires 28 September 2020               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           Pairing-Friendly Curves              March 2020


   For an element s' in F_p^d' such that s' = s'_0 + s'_1 * j + ... +
   s'_{d' / d - 1} * j^{d' / d - 1} for s'_0, s'_1, ..., s'_{d' / d - 1}
   in a basefield F_p^d, s' is represented as integer by oct(s') =
   oct(s'_0) || oct(s'_1) || ... || oct(s'_{d' / d - 1}), where
   oct(s'_0), ... , oct(s'_{d' / d - 1}) are octet strings encoded by
   above convention.

   In general, one can define encoding between integer and an element of
   any finite field tower by inductively applying the above convention.

   The parameters and test vectors of extension fields described in this
   memo are encoded by this convention and represented in octet stream.

   When applications communicate elements in an extension field, using
   the compression method [MP04] may be more effective.  In that case,
   you need to use it with care for interoperability.

3.  Security of Pairing-Friendly Curves

3.1.  Evaluating the Security of Pairing-Friendly Curves

   The security of pairing-friendly curves is evaluated by the hardness
   of the following discrete logarithm problems.

   *  The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) in G_1 and
      G_2

   *  The finite field discrete logarithm problem (FFDLP) in G_T

   There are other hard problems over pairing-friendly curves used for
   proving the security of pairing-based cryptography.  Such problems
   include computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman (CBDH) problem and
   bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) Problem, decision bilinear Diffie-
   Hellman (DBDH) problem, gap DBDH problem, etc [ECRYPT].  Almost all
   of these variants are reduced to the hardness of discrete logarithm
   problems described above and believed to be easier than the discrete
   logarithm problems.

   There would be the case where the attacker solves these reduced
   problems to break pairing-based cryptography.  Since such attacks
   have not been discovered yet, we discuss the hardness of the discrete
   logarithm problems in this memo.

   The security level of pairing-friendly curves is estimated by the
   computational cost of the most efficient algorithm to solve the above
   discrete logarithm problems.  The well-known algorithms for solving
   the discrete logarithm problems include Pollard's rho algorithm
   [Pollard78], Index Calculus [HR83] and so on.  In order to make index

Internet-Draft           Pairing-Friendly Curves              March 2020


   calculus algorithms more efficient, number field sieve (NFS)
   algorithms are utilized.

3.2.  Impact of the Recent Attack

   In 2016, Kim and Barbulescu proposed a new variant of the NFS
   algorithms, the extended tower number field sieve (exTNFS), which
   drastically reduces the complexity of solving FFDLP [KB16].  Due to
   exTNFS, the security level of pairing-friendly curves asymptotically
   dropped down.  For instance, Barbulescu and Duquesne estimated that
   the security of the BN curves which had been believed to provide 128
   bits of security (BN256, for example) dropped down to approximately
   100 bits [BD18].

   Some papers showed the minimum bit length of the parameters of
   pairing-friendly curves for each security level when applying exTNFS
   as an attacking method for FFDLP.  For 128 bits of security,
   Barbulescu and Duquesne estimated the minimum bit length of p of BN
   curves after exTNFS as 461 bits, and that of BLS12 curves as 461 bits
   [BD18].  For 256 bits of security, Kiyomura et al. estimated the
   minimum bit length of p^k of BLS48 curves as 27,410 bits, which
   implied 572 bits of p [KIK17].

4.  Selection of Pairing-Friendly Curves

   In this section, we introduce secure pairing-friendly curves that
   consider the impact of exTNFS.

   First, we show the adoption status of pairing-friendly curves in
   standards, libraries and applications, and classify them according to
   security level 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits.  Then, from the
   viewpoint of "security" and "widely use", pairing-friendly curves
   corresponding to each security level are selected and their
   parameters are indicated.

   In our selection policy, it is important that selected curves are
   shown in peer-reviewed paper for security and that they are widely
   used in cryptographic libraries.  In addition, "efficiency" is one of
   the important aspects but it is greatly depending on implementations,
   so we consider that viewpoint of "security" and "widely use" are more
   important than "efficiency" when considering interconnections and
   interoperability on future Internet.

4.1.  Adoption Status of Pairing-friendly Curves

   We show the pairing-friendly curves selected by existing standards,
   cryptographic libraries and applications.

   Table 1 summarizes the adoption status of pairing-friendly curves.
   The details are described as following subsections.  A BN curve with
   a XXX-bit characteristic p is denoted as BNXXX and a BLS curve of
   embedding degree k with a XXX-bit p denoted as BLSk_XXX.  Due to
   space limitations, Table 1 omits libraries that have not been
   maintained since 2016 in which exTNFS was proposed and curves that
   had security levels below 128 bits since before 2016 (ex.  BN160).
   The full version of Table1 is available at https://lepidum.co.jp/
   blog/2020-03-27/ietf-draft-pfc/. In this table, security level for
   each curve is evaluated according to [BD18],[GME19], [MAF19] and
   [FK18].  Note that the curves marked as (*) indicate that the
   evaluation of security level does not take into account the impact of
   the exTNFS because [BD18] does not show the security level of these
   curves.

            Table 1: Adoption Status of Pairing-Friendly Curves

4.1.1.  International Standards

   ISO/IEC 15946 series specifies public-key cryptographic techniques
   based on elliptic curves.  ISO/IEC 15946-5 [ISOIEC15946-5] shows
   numerical examples of MNT curves[MNT01] with 160-bit p and 256-bit p,
   Freeman curves[Freeman06] with 224-bit p and 256-bit p, and BN curves
   with 160-bit p, 192-bit p, 224-bit p, 256-bit p, 384-bit p and
   512-bit p.  These parameters do not take into account the effects of
   the exTNFS.  On the other hand, the parameters may be revised in the
   future version since ISO/IEC 15946-5 is currently under development.
   As described below, BN curves with 256-bit p and 512-bit p specified
   in ISO/IEC 15946-5 used by other standards and libraries, these
   curves are especially denoted as BN256I and BN512I.

   TCG adopts the BN256I and a BN curve with 638-bit p specified by
   their own[TPM].  FIDO Alliance [FIDO] and W3C [W3C] adopt BN256I,
   BN512I, the BN638 by TCG and the BN curve with 256-bit proposed by
   Devegili et al.[DSD07] (named BN256D).

4.1.2.  Cryptographic Libraries

   There are a lot of cryptographic libraries that support pairing
   calculations.

   PBC is a library for pairing-based cryptography published by Stanford
   University and it supports BN curves, MNT curves, Freeman curves, and
   supersingular curves[PBC].  Users can generate pairing parameters by
   PBC and use pairing operations with the generated parameters.

   mcl[mcl] is a library for pairing-based cryptography which supports
   four BN curves and BLS12_381.  These BN curves include BN254 proposed
   by Nogami et al.  [NASKM08] (named BN254N), BN_SNARK1 suitable for
   SNARK applications[libsnark], BN382M, and BN462.  Kyushu university
   publishes a library that supports the BLS48_581[BLS48].  University
   of Tsukuba Elliptic Curve and Pairing Library (TEPLA)[TEPLA] supports
   two BN curves, one is BN254N and the other is BN254 proposed by
   Beuchat et al.  [BGMORT10] (named BN254B).  Intel publishes a
   cryptographic library named Intel Integrated Performance
   Primitives(Intel-IPP)[Intel-IPP] and the library supports BN256I.

   RELIC[RELIC] uses various types of pairing-friendly curves that
   include six BN curves (BN158, BN254R, BN256R, BN382R, BN446, and
   BN638), where BN254R, BN256R and BN382R are RELIC specific parameters
   and they are different from BN254N, BN254B, BN256I, BN256D and
   BN382M.  In addition, RELIC supports six BLS curves (BLS12_381,
   BLS12_446, BLS12_445, BLS12_638, BLS24_477 and BLS48_575[MAF19]),
   Cocks-Pinch curves of embedding degree 8 with 544-bit p[GME19],
   pairing-friendly curves constructed by Scott et al.[SG19] based on
   Kachisa-Scott-Schaefer curve with embedding degree 54 with 569-bit p
   (named K54_569)[MAF19], a KSS curve[KSS08] of embedding degree 18
   with 508-bit p (named KSS18_508)[AFKMR12], Optimal TNFS-secure curve
   [FM19] of embedding degree 8 with 511-bit p(OT8_511), and a
   supersingular curve[S86] with 1536-bit p (SS_1536).

   Apache Milagro Crypto Library (AMCL)[AMCL] supports four BLS curves
   (BLS12_381, BLS12_461, BLS24_479 and BLS48_556) and four BN curves
   (BN254N, BN254CX which is proposed by CertiVox, BN256I and BN512I).
   In addition to AMCL's supported curves, MIRACL[MIRACL] supports BN462
   and BLS48_581.

   Adjoint publishes a library that supports the BLS12_381 and six BN
   curves (BN_SNARK1, BN254B, BN254N, BN254S1, BN254S2, and BN462)

   [AdjointLib], where BN254S1 and BN254S2 are BN curves adopted by old
   version of AMCL [AMCLv2].

4.1.3.  Applications

   Several applications adopt pairing-friendly curves such as BN curves
   and BLS curves.

   Zcash implements a BN curve (named BN128) in their library libsnark
   [libsnark].  After exTNFS, they propose a new parameter of BLS12 as
   BLS12_381 [BLS12-381] and publish its experimental implementation
   [zkcrypto].

   Ethereum 2.0 adopts the BLS12_381 and uses implementation by
   Meyer[pureGo-bls].  Chia Network publishes their implementation
   [Chia] by integrating the RELIC toolkit [RELIC].  DFINITY uses mcl
   and Algorand publishes their implementation which supports BLS12_381.

4.2.  For 100 Bits of Security

   Before exTNFS, BN curves with 256-bit size of underlying finite field
   (so-called BN256) were considered to achieve 128 bits of security.
   After exTNFS, however, the security level of BN curves with 256-bit
   size of underlying finite field fell into 100 bits.

   Implementers who will newly develop the applications of pairing-based
   cryptography SHOULD NOT use pairing-friendly curves with 100 bits of
   security (i.e.  BN256).

   There exists applications which already implemented pairing-based
   cryptography with 100-bit secure pairing-friendly curves.  In such a
   case, implementers MAY use 100 bits of security only if they need to
   keep interoperability with the existing applications.

4.3.  For 128 Bits of Security

   Table 1 shows that a lot of pairing-friendly curves whose curve types
   are BN curves and BLS curves are adopted as curves of 128 bits
   security level.  Among them, the one that best matches our selection
   policy is BN462, so we introduce the parameters of BN462 in this
   section.

   On the other hand, from the viewpoint of "widely use", BLS12_381 is
   an attractive curve because a lot of libraries and applications adopt
   it.  However, because it is not published as a curve of 128-bit
   security level in peer-reviewed papers, it does not match our
   selection policy.  In addition, according to [BD18], the bit length
   of p for BLS12 to achieve 128 bits of security is calculated as 461

   bits and more, which BLS12_381 does not satisfy.  Since BLS12_381 has
   a large influence from the viewpoint of interoperability, we
   introduce parameters of BLS12_381 in Appendix C.

4.3.1.  BN Curves

   A BN curve with 128 bits of security is shown in [BD18], which we
   call BN462.  BN462 is defined by a parameter

       t = 2^114 + 2^101 - 2^14 - 1

   for the definition in Section 2.3.

   For the finite field F_p, the towers of extension field F_p^2, F_p^6
   and F_p^12 are defined by indeterminates u, v, w as follows:

       F_p^2 = F_p[u] / (u^2 + 1)
       F_p^6 = F_p^2[v] / (v^3 - u - 2)
       F_p^12 = F_p^6[w] / (w^2 - v).

   Defined by t, the elliptic curve E and its twisted curve E' are
   represented by E: y^2 = x^3 + 5 and E': y^2 = x^3 - u + 2,
   respectively.  The size of p becomes 462-bit length.  A pairing e is
   defined by taking G_1 as a cyclic group of order r generated by a
   base point BP = (x, y) in F_p, G_2 as a cyclic group of order r
   generated by a based point BP' = (x', y') in F_p^2, and G_T as a
   subgroup of a multiplicative group (F_p^12)^* of order r.  BN462 is
   D-type.

   We give the following parameters for BN462.

   *  G_1 defined over E: y^2 = x^3 + b

      -  p : a characteristic

      -  r : an order

      -  BP = (x, y) : a base point

      -  h : a cofactor

      -  b : a coefficient of E

   *  G_2 defined over E': y^2 = x^3 + b'

      -  r' : an order

4.4.  For 192 Bits of Security

   As shown in Table 1, candidates of pairing-friendly curves for the
   security level 192 bits are only two curves BLS24_477 and BLS24_479.
   BLS24_477 has only one implementation and BLS24_479 is an
   experimental parameter which is not shown in peer-reviewed paper.
   Therefore, because none match our selection policy, we couldn't show
   parameters for security level 192 bits here.

4.5.  For 256 Bits of Security

   As shown in Table 1, there are three candidats of pairing-friendly
   curves for security level 256 bit.  According to our selection
   policy, we select BLS48_581 which is the most adopted by
   cryptographic libraries.

   The selected BLS48 curve is shown in [KIK17] and it is defined by a
   parameter

       t = -1 + 2^7 - 2^10 - 2^30 - 2^32.

   For the finite field F_p, the towers of extension field F_p^2, F_p^4,
   F_p^8, F_p^24 and F_p^48 are defined by indeterminates u, v, w, z, s
   as follows:

       F_p^2 = F_p[u] / (u^2 + 1)
       F_p^4 = F_p^2[v] / (v^2 + u + 1)
       F_p^8 = F_p^4[w] / (w^2 + v)
       F_p^24 = F_p^8[z] / (z^3 + w)
       F_p^48 = F_p^24[s] / (s^2 + z).

   The elliptic curve E and its twisted curve E' are represented by E:
   y^2 = x^3 + 1 and E': y^2 = x^3 - 1 / w.  A pairing e is defined by
   taking G_1 as a cyclic group of order r generated by a base point BP
   = (x, y) in F_p, G_2 as a cyclic group of order r generated by a
   based point BP' = (x', y') in F_p^8, and G_T as a subgroup of a
   multiplicative group (F_p^48)^* of order r.  The size of p becomes
   581-bit length.  BLS48-581 is D-type.

   We then give the parameters for BLS48-581 as follows.

   *  G_1 defined over E: y^2 = x^3 + b

      -  p : a characteristic

      -  r : a prime which divides an order of G_1

      -  BP = (x, y) : a base point

      -  h : a cofactor

      -  b : a coefficient of E

   *  G_2 defined over E': y^2 = x^3 + b'

      -  r' : an order

      -  BP' = (x', y') : a base point (encoded with
         [I-D.ietf-lwig-curve-representations])

         o  x' = x'_0 + x'_1 * u + x'_2 * v + x'_3 * u * v + x'_4 * w +
            x'_5 * u * w + x'_6 * v * w + x'_7 * u * v * w (x'_0, ...,
            x'_7 in F_p)

         o  y' = y'_0 + y'_1 * u + y'_2 * v + y'_3 * u * v + y'_4 * w +
            y'_5 * u * w + y'_6 * v * w + y'_7 * u * v * w (y'_0, ...,
            y'_7 in F_p)

5.  Security Considerations

   This memo entirely describes the security of pairing-friendly curves,
   and introduces secure parameters of pairing-friendly curves.  We give
   these parameters in terms of security, efficiency and global
   acceptance.  The parameters for 100, 128, 192 and 256 bits of
   security are introduced since the security level will different in
   the requirements of the pairing-based applications.  Implementers can
   select these parameters according to their security requirements.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

Appendix A.  Computing Optimal Ate Pairing

   Before presenting the computation of optimal Ate pairing e(P, Q)
   satisfying the properties shown in Section 2.2, we give subfunctions
   used for pairing computation.

   The following algorithm Line_Function shows the computation of the
   line function.  It takes A = (A[1], A[2]), B = (B[1], B[2]) in G_2
   and P = ((P[1], P[2])) in G_1 as input and outputs an element of G_T.

       if (A = B) then
           l := (3 * A[1]^2) / (2 * A[2]);
       else if (A = -B) then
           return P[1] - A[1];
       else
           l := (B[2] - A[2]) / (B[1] - A[1]);
       end if;
       return (l * (P[1] -A[1]) + A[2] -P[2]);

   When implementing the line function, implementers should consider the
   isomorphism of E and its twisted curve E' so that one can reduce the

   computational cost of operations in G_2.  We note that the function
   Line_function does not consider such isomorphism.

   Computation of optimal Ate pairing for BN curves uses Frobenius map.
   Let a Frobenius map pi for a point Q = (x, y) over E' be pi(p, Q) =
   (x^p, y^p).

A.1.  Optimal Ate Pairings over Barreto-Naehrig Curves

   Let c = 6 * t + 2 for a parameter t and c_0, c_1, ... , c_L in
   {-1,0,1} such that the sum of c_i * 2^i (i = 0, 1, ..., L) equals to
   c.

   The following algorithm shows the computation of optimal Ate pairing
   over Barreto-Naehrig curves.  It takes P in G_1, Q in G_2, an integer
   c, c_0, ...,c_L in {-1,0,1} such that the sum of c_i * 2^i (i = 0, 1,
   ..., L) equals to c, and an order r as input, and outputs e(P, Q).

       f := 1; T := Q;
       if (c_L = -1)
           T := -T;
       end if
       for i = L-1 to 0
           f := f^2 * Line_function(T, T, P); T := 2 * T;
           if (c_i = 1 | c_i = -1)
               f := f * Line_function(T, c_i * Q); T := T + c_i * Q;
           end if
       end for
       Q_1 := pi(p, Q); Q_2 := pi(p, Q_1);
       f := f * Line_function(T, Q_1, P); T := T + Q_1;
       f := f * Line_function(T, -Q_2, P);
       f := f^{(p^k - 1) / r}
       return f;

A.2.  Optimal Ate Pairings over Barreto-Lynn-Scott Curves

   Let c = t for a parameter t and c_0, c_1, ... , c_L in {-1,0,1} such
   that the sum of c_i * 2^i (i = 0, 1, ..., L) equals to c.  The
   following algorithm shows the computation of optimal Ate pairing over
   Barreto-Lynn-Scott curves.  It takes P in G_1, Q in G_2, a parameter
   c, c_0, c_1, ..., c_L in {-1,0,1} such that the sum of c_i * 2^i (i =
   0, 1, ..., L), and an order r as input, and outputs e(P, Q).

       f := 1; T := Q;
       if (c_L = -1)
           T := -T;
       end if
       for i = L-1 to 0
           f := f^2 * Line_function(T, T, P); T := 2 * T;
           if (c_i = 1 | c_i = -1)
               f := f * Line_function(T, c_i * Q, P); T := T + c_i * Q;
           end if
       end for
       f := f^{(p^k - 1) / r};
       return f;

Appendix B.  Test Vectors of Optimal Ate Pairing

   We provide test vectors for Optimal Ate Pairing e(P, Q) given in
   Appendix A for the curves BN462 and BLS48-581 given in Section 4.
   Here, the inputs P = (x, y) and Q = (x', y') are the corresponding
   base points BP and BP' given in Section 4.

   For BN462, Q = (x', y') is given by

       x' = x'_0 + x'_1 * u and
       y' = y'_0 + y'_1 * u,

   where u is a indeterminate and x'_0, x'_1, y'_0, y'_1 are elements of
   F_p.

   For BLS48-581, Q = (x', y') is given by

       x' = x'_0 + x'_1 * u + x'_2 * v + x'_3 * u * v
           + x'_4 * w + x'_5 * u * w + x'_6 * v * w + x'_7 * u * v * w and
       y' = y'_0 + y'_1 * u + y'_2 * v + y'_3 * u * v
           + y'_4 * w + y'_5 * u * w + y'_6 * v * w + y'_7 * u * v * w,

   where u, v and w are indeterminates and x'_0, ..., x'_7 and y'_0,
   ..., y'_7 are elements of F_p.  The representation of Q = (x', y')
   given below is followed by [I-D.ietf-lwig-curve-representations].

Appendix C.  Parameters of the Barreto-Lynn-Scott Curve of embedding
             degree 12

   In this part, we introduce parameters of the Barreto-Lynn-Scott curve
   of embedding degree 12 with 381 bits p that adopted by a lot of
   applications such as Zcash [Zcash], Ethereum [Ethereum] and so on.

   BLS12_381 curve is shown in [BLS12-381] and it is defined by a
   parameter

       t = -2^63 - 2^62 - 2^60 - 2^57 - 2^48 - 2^16

   where the size of p becomes 381-bit length.

   For the finite field F_p, the towers of extension field F_p^2, F_p^6
   and F_p^12 are defined by indeterminates u, v, w as follows:

       F_p^2 = F_p[u] / (u^2 + 1)
       F_p^6 = F_p^2[v] / (v^3 - u - 1)
       F_p^12 = F_p^6[w] / (w^2 - v).

   Defined by t, the elliptic curve E and its twisted curve E' are
   represented by E: y^2 = x^3 + 4 and E': y^2 = x^3 + 4(u + 1).

   A pairing e is defined by taking G_1 as a cyclic group of order r
   generated by a base point BP = (x, y) in F_p, G_2 as a cyclic group
   of order r generated by a based point BP' = (x', y') in F_p^2, and
   G_T as a subgroup of a multiplicative group (F_p^12)^* of order r.
   BLS12_381 is M-type.

   We have to note that, according to [BD18], the bit length of p for
   BLS12 to achieve 128 bits of security is calculated as 461 bits and
   more, which BLS12_381 does not satisfy.
