Abstract 

   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-
   TP) is based on a profile of the MPLS and pseudowire (PW) 
   procedures as specified in the MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-
   TE), PW and multi-segment PW (MS-PW) architectures complemented 
   with additional Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) 
   procedures for fault, performance and protection-switching 
   management for packet transport applications that do not rely on 
   the presence of a control plane. 

   This document describes a framework to support a comprehensive 
   set of OAM procedures that fulfill the MPLS-TP OAM requirements. 

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task 
   Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union 
   Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to 
   include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 
   architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of 
   a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.

Editors' Note: 

   This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF 
   Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an 
   IETF Last Call. 

   [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an 
   RFC and insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that 
   the published RFC has IETF Consensus.] 

1. Introduction 

   As noted in [5], the multi protocol label switching (MPLS) 
   transport profile (MPLS-TP) defines a profile of the MPLS-
   Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and Multi-segment Pseudo Wire 
   (MS-PW) architectures defined in RFC 3031 [1], RFC 3985 [2] and 
   RFC 5659 [4] which is complemented with additional OAM 
   mechanisms and procedures for alarm, fault, performance and 
   protection-switching management for packet transport 
   applications. 

   In line with [10], existing MPLS OAM mechanisms will be used 
   wherever possible and extensions or new OAM mechanisms will be 
   defined only where existing mechanisms are not sufficient to 
   meet the requirements. Extensions do not deprecate support for 
   existing MPLS OAM capabilities. 

   The MPLS-TP OAM framework defined in this document provides a 
   comprehensive set of OAM procedures that satisfy the MPLS-TP OAM 
   requirements [8]. In this regard, it defines similar OAM 
   functionality as for existing SONET/SDH and OTN OAM mechanisms 
   (e.g. [13]). 

   The MPLS-TP OAM framework is applicable to both LSPs and 
   (MS-)PWs and supports co-routed and associated bidirectional p2p 
   transport paths as well as unidirectional p2p and p2mp transport 
   paths. 

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task 
   Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union 
   Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to 
   include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 
   architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of 
   a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.

2.2. Definitions 

   Note - the definitions in this section are aligned with ITU-T 
   recommendation Y.1731 in order to have a common, unambiguous 
   terminology. They do not however intend to imply a certain 
   implementation but rather serve as a framework to describe the 
   necessary OAM functions for MPLS-TP. 

   Data plane loopback: it is an out-of-service test where an 
   interface at either an intermediate or terminating node in a 
   path is placed into a data plane loopback state, such that all 
   traffic (including user data and OAM) received on the looped 
   back interface is sent on the reverse direction of the transport 
   path. 

   Domain Border Node (DBN): An LSP intermediate MPLS-TP node (LSR) 
   that is at the boundary of an MPLS-TP OAM domain. Such a node 
   may be present on the edge of two domains or may be connected by 
   a link to an MPLS-TP node in another OAM domain. 

   Down MEP: A MEP residing in a node that receives OAM packets 
   from, and transmits them towards, the direction of a server 
   layer. 

   In-Service: the administrative status of a transport path when 
   it is unlocked. 

   Intermediate Node: An intermediate node transits traffic for an 
   LSP or a PW. An intermediate node may originate OAM flows 
   directed to downstream intermediate nodes or MEPs. 

   Loopback: see data plane loopback and OAM loopback definitions. 

   Maintenance Entity (ME): Some portion of a transport path that 
   requires management bounded by two points, and the relationship 
   between those points to which maintenance and monitoring 
   operations apply (details in section 3.1).  

   Maintenance Entity Group (MEG): The set of one or more 
   maintenance entities that maintain and monitor a transport path 
   in an OAM domain. 

   MEP: A MEG end point (MEP) is capable of initiating (MEP Source) 
   and terminating (MEP Sink) OAM messages for fault management and 
   performance monitoring. MEPs define the boundaries of an ME 
   (details in section 3.3).

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   MEP Source: A MEP acts as MEP source for an OAM message when it 
   originates and inserts the message into the transport path for 
   its associated MEG. 

   MEP Sink: A MEP acts as a MEP sink for an OAM message when it 
   terminates and processes the messages received from its 
   associated MEG. 

   MIP: A MEG intermediate point (MIP) terminates and processes OAM 
   messages and may generate OAM messages in reaction to received 
   OAM messages. It never generates unsolicited OAM messages 
   itself. A MIP resides within a MEG between MEPs (details in 
   section 3.3). 

   OAM domain: A domain, as defined in [5], whose entities are 
   grouped for the purpose of keeping the OAM confined within that 
   domain. 

   Note - within the rest of this document the term "domain" is 
   used to indicate an "OAM domain" 

   OAM flow: Is the set of all OAM messages originating with a 
   specific MEP source that instrument one direction of a MEG. 

   OAM information element: An atomic piece of information 
   exchanged between MEPs in MEG used by an OAM application. 

   OAM loopback: it is the capability of a node to intercepts some 
   specific OAM packets and to generate a reply back to their 
   sender. OAM loopback can work in-service and can support 
   different OAM functions (e.g., bidirectional on-demand 
   connectivity verification). 

   OAM Message: One or more OAM information elements that when 
   exchanged between MEPs or between MEPs and MIPs performs some 
   OAM functionality (e.g. connectivity verification) 

   OAM Packet: A packet that carries one or more OAM messages (i.e. 
   OAM information elements). 

   Out-of-Service: the administrative status of a transport path 
   when it is locked.  When a path is in a locked condition, it is 
   blocked from carrying client traffic. 

   Path Segment: It is either a segment or a concatenated segment, 
   as defined in RFC 5654 [5].

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   Signal Fail: A condition declared by a MEP when the data 
   forwarding capability associated with a transport path has 
   failed, e.g. loss of continuity. See also [9]. 

   Tandem Connection: A tandem connection is an arbitrary part of a 
   transport path that can be monitored (via OAM) independent of 
   the end-to-end monitoring (OAM). The tandem connection may also 
   include the forwarding engine(s) of the node(s) at the 
   boundaries of the tandem connection. 

   Up MEP: A MEP residing in a node that transmits OAM packets 
   towards, and receives them from, the direction of the forwarding 
   engine. 

   This document uses the terms defined in RFC 5654 [5]. 

   This document uses the term 'Per-hop Behavior' as defined in 
   [11]. 

   This document uses the term LSP to indicate either a service LSP 
   or a transport LSP (as defined in [5]). 

3. Functional Components 

   MPLS-TP defines a profile of the MPLS and PW architectures ([1], 
   [2] and [4]) that is required to transport service traffic where 
   the characteristics of information transfer between the 
   transport path endpoints can be demonstrated to comply with 
   certain performance and quality guarantees. 

   In order to describe the required OAM functionality, this 
   document introduces a set of high-level functional components. 

3.1. Maintenance Entity and Maintenance Entity Group 

   MPLS-TP OAM operates in the context of Maintenance Entities 
   (MEs) that are a relationship between any two points of a 
   transport path to which maintenance and monitoring operations 
   apply. The collection of one or more MEs that belongs to the 
   same transport path and that are maintained and monitored as a 
   group are known as a maintenance entity group (MEG) and the two 
   points that define a maintenance entity are called Maintenance 
   Entity Group (MEG) End Points (MEPs). In between these two 
   points zero or more intermediate points, called Maintenance 
   Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs), can exist and can be 
   shared by more than one ME in a MEG.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   The abstract reference model for an ME with MEPs and MIPs is 
   described in Figure 1 below: 

    
                            +-+    +-+    +-+    +-+ 
                            |A|----|B|----|C|----|D| 
                            +-+    +-+    +-+    +-+ 
    
                 Figure 1 ME Abstract Reference Model 

   The instantiation of this abstract model to different MPLS-TP 
   entities is described in section 4. In this model, nodes A, B, C 
   and D can be LER/LSR for an LSP or the {S|T}-PEs for a MS-PW. 
   MEPs reside in nodes A and D while MIPs reside in nodes B and C 
   and may reside in A and D. The links connecting adjacent nodes 
   can be physical links, (sub-)layer LSPs/PSTs, or serving layer 
   paths. 

   This functional model defines the relationships between all OAM 
   entities from a maintenance perspective, to allow each 
   Maintenance Entity to monitor and manage the (sub-)layer network 
   under its responsibility and to localize problems efficiently. 

   An MPLS-TP Maintenance Entity Group may be defined to monitor 
   the transport path for fault and/or performance management. 

   The MEPs that form a MEG are configured and managed to limit the 
   scope of an OAM flow within the MEG that the MEPs belong to 
   (i.e. within the domain of the transport path that is being 
   monitored and managed). A misbranching fault may cause OAM 
   packets to be delivered to a MEP that is not in the MEG of 
   origin. 

   In case of unidirectional point-to-point transport paths, a 
   single unidirectional Maintenance Entity is defined to monitor 
   it. 

   In case of associated bi-directional point-to-point transport 
   paths, two independent unidirectional Maintenance Entities are 
   defined to independently monitor each direction. This has 
   implications for transactions that terminate at or query a MIP, 
   as a return path from MIP to source MEP does not necessarily 
   exist in the MEG. 

   In case of co-routed bi-directional point-to-point transport 
   paths, a single bidirectional Maintenance Entity is defined to 
   monitor both directions congruently.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   In case of unidirectional point-to-multipoint transport paths, a 
   single unidirectional Maintenance entity for each leaf is 
   defined to monitor the transport path from the root to that 
   leaf. 

   The reference model for the p2mp MEG is represented in Figure 2.

                Figure 2 Reference Model for p2mp MEG 

   In case of p2mp transport paths, the OAM operations are 
   independent for each ME (A-D, A-E and A-F): 

   o  Fault conditions - some faults may impact more than one ME 
      depending from where the failure is located; 

   o  Packet loss - packet dropping may impact more than one ME 
      depending from where the packets are lost; 

   o  Packet delay - will be unique per ME. 

   Each leaf (i.e. D, E and F) terminates OAM flows to monitor the 
   ME from itself and the root while the root (i.e. A) generates 
   OAM messages common to all the MEs of the p2mp MEG. All nodes 
   may implement a MIP in the corresponding MEG. 

3.2. Nested MEGs: Path Segment Tunnels and Tandem Connection 
   Monitoring 

   In order to verify and maintain performance and quality 
   guarantees, there is a need to not only apply OAM functionality 
   on a transport path granularity (e.g. LSP or MS-PW), but also on 
   arbitrary parts of transport paths, defined as Tandem 
   Connections, between any two arbitrary points along a transport 
   path.

   Path segment tunnels (PSTs), as defined in [5], are instantiated 
   to provide monitoring of a portion of a set of co-routed 
   transport paths (LSPs or MS-PWs). Path segment tunnels can also 
   be employed to meet the requirement to provide tandem connection 
   monitoring (TCM). 

   TCM for a given path segment of a transport path is implemented 
   by creating a path segment tunnel that has a 1:1 association 
   with the path segment of the transport path that is to be 
   uniquely monitored. This means that the PST used to provide TCM 
   can carry only one and only one transport path thus allowing 
   direct correlation between all fault management and performance 
   monitoring information gathered for the PST and the monitored 
   path segment of the end-to-end transport path. The PST is 
   monitored using normal LSP monitoring. 

   There are a number of implications to this approach: 

   1) The PST would use the uniform model of TC code point copying 
      between sub-layers for diffserv such that the E2E markings 
      and PHB treatment for the transport path was preserved by the 
      PST. 

   2) The PST would use the pipe model for TTL handling such that 
      MIP addressing for the E2E entity would be not be impacted by 
      the presence of the PST. 

   3) PM statistics need to be adjusted for the encapsulation 
      overhead of the additional PST sub-layer. 

   A PST is instantiated to create a MEG that monitors a path 
   segment of a transport path (LSP or PW). The endpoints of the 
   PST are MEPs and limit the scope of an OAM flow within the MEG 
   the MEPs belong to (i.e. within the domain of the PST that is 
   being monitored and managed). 

   The following properties apply to all MPLS-TP MEGs: 

   o  They can be nested but not overlapped, e.g. a MEG may cover a 
      segment or a concatenated segment of another MEG, and may 
      also include the forwarding engine(s) of the node(s) at the 
      edge(s) of the segment or concatenated segment. However when 
      MEGs are nested, the MEPs and MIPs in the nested MEG are no 
      longer part of the encompassing MEG.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   o  It is possible that MEPs of nested MEGs reside on a single 
      node but again implemented in such a way that they do not 
      overlap. 

   o  Each OAM flow is associated with a single Maintenance Entity 
      Group. 

   o  OAM packets that instrument a particular direction of a 
      transport path are subject to the same forwarding treatment 
      (i.e. fate share) as the data traffic and in some cases may 
      be required to have common queuing discipline E2E with the 
      class of traffic monitored. OAM packets can be distinguished 
      from the data traffic using the GAL and ACH constructs [6] 
      for LSP and Section or the ACH construct [3]and [6] for 
      (MS-)PW. 

   o  When a PST is instantiated after the transport path has been 
      instantiated the addressing of the MIPs will change. 

3.3. MEG End Points (MEPs) 

   MEG End Points (MEPs) are the source and sink points of a MEG. 
   In the context of an MPLS-TP LSP, only LERs can implement MEPs 
   while in the context of a path segment tunnel (PST) LSRs for the 
   MPLS-TP LSP can be LERs for PSTs that contribute to the overall 
   monitoring infrastructure for the transport path. Regarding 
   MPLS-TP PW, only T-PEs can implement MEPs while for PSTs 
   supporting a PW both T-PEs and S-PEs can implement MEPs. In the 
   context of MPLS-TP Section, any MPLS-TP LSR can implement a MEP 
   for a serving (sub-)layer PST. 

   MEPs are responsible for activating and controlling all of the 
   proactive and on demand monitoring OAM functionality for the 
   MEG. There is a separate class of server layer originated 
   notifications (such as LKR and AIS) that are originated by 
   intermediate nodes.  A MEP is capable of originating and 
   terminating OAM messages for fault management and performance 
   monitoring. These OAM messages are encapsulated into an OAM 
   packet using the G-ACh as defined in RFC 5586 [6]: in this case 
   the G-ACh message is an OAM message and the channel type 
   indicates an OAM message. A MEP terminates all the OAM packets 
   it receives from the MEG it belongs to. The MEG the OAM packet 
   belongs to is inferred from the MPLS or PW label or, in case of 
   MPLS-TP section, the MPLS-TP port the OAM packet has been 
   received with the GAL at the top of the label stack. 


 
 
Busi et al.            Expires October 21, 2010               [Page 13] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   OAM packets may require the use of an available "out-of-band" 
   return path (as defined in [5]). In such cases sufficient 
   information is required in the originating transaction such that 
   the OAM reply packet can be constructed (e.g. IP address). 

   Each OAM solution will further detail its applicability as a 
   pro-active or on-demand measurement as well as its usage when: 

   o  the "in-band" return path exists and it is used; 

   o  an "out-of-band" return path exists and it is used; 

   o  any return path does not exist or is not used. 

   Once a MEG is configured, the operator can configure which 
   proactive OAM functions to use on the MEG but the MEPs are 
   always enabled. A node at the edge of a MEG always supports a 
   MEP. 

   MEPs terminate all OAM packets received from the associated MEG. 
   As the MEP corresponds to the termination of the forwarding path 
   for a MEG at the given (sub-)layer, OAM packets never leak 
   outside of a MEG in a properly configured fault free 
   implementation. 

   A MEP of an MPLS-TP transport path coincides with transport path 
   termination and monitors it for failures or performance 
   degradation (e.g. based on packet counts) in an end-to-end 
   scope. Note that both MEP source and MEP sink coincide with 
   transport paths' source and sink terminations. 

   The MEPs of a path segment tunnel are not necessarily coincident 
   with the termination of the MPLS-TP transport path and monitor a 
   path segment of the transport path for failures or performance 
   degradation (e.g. based on packet counts) only within the 
   boundary of the MEG for the path segment tunnel. 

   An MPLS-TP MEP sink passes a fault indication to its client 
   (sub-)layer network as a consequent action of fault detection. 

   A node at the edge of a MEG can either support per-node MEP or 
   per-interface MEP(s). A per-node MEP resides in an unspecified 
   location within the node while a per-interface MEP resides on a 
   specific side of the forwarding engine. In particular a per-
   interface MEP is called "Up MEP" or "Down MEP" depending on its 
   location relative to the forwarding engine.

              Figure 3 Example of per-interface Up MEPs 

   Figure 3 describes two examples of per-interface Up MEPs: an Up 
   Source MEP in a source node (case 1) and an Up Sink MEP in a 
   destination node (case 2). 

   The usage of per-interface Up MEPs extends the coverage of the 
   ME for both fault and performance monitoring closer to the edge 
   of the domain and allows the isolation of failures or 
   performance degradation to being within a node or either the 
   link or interfaces. 

   Each OAM solution will further detail the implications when used 
   with per-interface or per-node MEPs, if necessary. 

   It may occur that the Up MEPs of a path segment tunnel are set 
   on both sides of the forwarding engine such that the MEG is 
   entirely internal to the node. 

   Note that a MEP can only exist at the beginning and end of a 
   (sub-)layer in MPLS-TP. If there is a need to monitor some 
   portion of that LSP or PW, a new sub-layer in the form of a path 
   segment tunnel is created which permits MEPs and an associated 
   MEG to be created. 

   In the case where an intermediate node sends a message to a MEP, 
   it uses the top label of the stack at that point. 

3.4. MEG Intermediate Points (MIPs) 

   A MEG Intermediate Point (MIP) is a function located at a point 
   between the MEPs of a MEG for a PW, LSP or PST.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   A MIP is capable of reacting to some OAM packets and forwarding 
   all the other OAM packets while ensuring fate sharing with data 
   plane packets. However, a MIP does not initiate unsolicited OAM 
   packets, but may be addressed by OAM packets initiated by one of 
   the MEPs of the MEG. A MIP can generate OAM packets only in 
   response to OAM packets that are sent on the MEG it belongs to. 

   An intermediate node within a MEG can either: 

   o  support per-node MIP (i.e. a single MIP per node in an 
      unspecified location within the node); 

   o  support per-interface MIP (i.e. two or more MIPs per node on 
      both sides of the forwarding engine). 

                                   Intermediate node

                Figure 4 Example of per-interface MIPs 

   Figure 4 describes an example of two per-interface MIPs at an 
   intermediate node of a point-to-point MEG. 

   The usage of per-interface MIPs allows the isolation of failures 
   or performance degradation to being within a node or either the 
   link or interfaces. 

   When sending an OAM packet to a MIP, the source MEP should set 
   the TTL field to indicate the number of hops necessary to reach 
   the node where the MIP resides. It is always assumed that the 
   "pipe"/"short pipe" model of TTL handling is used by the MPLS 
   transport profile.  

   The source MEP should also include Target MIP information in the 
   OAM packets sent to a MIP to allow proper identification of the 
   MIP within the node. The MEG the OAM packet is associated with 
   is inferred from the MPLS label.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   A node at the edge of a MEG can also support per-interface Up 
   MEPs and per-interface MIPs on either side of the forwarding 
   engine. 

   Once a MEG is configured, the operator can enable/disable the 
   MIPs on the nodes within the MEG. All the intermediate nodes and 
   possibly the end nodes host MIP(s). Local policy allows them to 
   be enabled per function and per MEG. The local policy is 
   controlled by the management system, which may delegate it to 
   the control plane. 

3.5.  Server MEPs 

   A server MEP is a MEP of a MEG that is either: 

   o  defined in a layer network that is "below", which is to say 
      encapsulates and transports the MPLS-TP layer network being 
      referenced, or 

   o  defined in a sub-layer of the MPLS-TP layer network that is 
      "below" which is to say encapsulates and transports the sub-
      layer being referenced. 

   A server MEP can coincide with a MIP or a MEP in the client 
   (MPLS-TP) (sub-)layer network. 

   A server MEP also interacts with the client/server adaptation 
   function between the client (MPLS-TP) (sub-)layer network and 
   the server (sub-)layer network. The adaptation function 
   maintains state on the mapping of MPLS-TP transport paths that 
   are setup over that server (sub-)layer's transport path.  

   For example, a server MEP can be either: 

   o  A termination point of a physical link (e.g. 802.3), an SDH 
      VC or OTN ODU, for the MPLS-TP Section layer network, defined 
      in section 4.1; 

   o  An MPLS-TP Section MEP for MPLS-TP LSPs, defined in section 
      4.2; 

   o  An MPLS-TP LSP MEP for MPLS-TP PWs, defined in section 4.3; 

   o  An MPLS-TP PST MEP used for LSP path segment monitoring, as 
      defined in section 4.4, for MPLS-TP LSPs or higher-level PSTs 
      providing LSP path segment monitoring;

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   o  An MPLS-TP PST MEP used for PW path segment monitoring, as 
      defined in section 4.5, for MPLS-TP PWs or higher-level PSTs 
      providing PW path segment monitoring. 

   The server MEP can run appropriate OAM functions for fault 
   detection within the server (sub-)layer network, and provides a 
   fault indication to its client MPLS-TP layer network. Server MEP 
   OAM functions are outside the scope of this document. 

3.6. Configuration Considerations 

   When a control plane is not present, the management plane 
   configures these functional components. Otherwise they can be 
   configured either by the management plane or by the control 
   plane. 

   Local policy allows to disable the usage of any available "out-
   of-band" return path, as defined in [5], to generate OAM reply 
   packets, irrespectively on what is requested by the node 
   originating the OAM packet triggering the request. 

   PSTs are usually instantiated when the transport path is created 
   by either the management plane or by the control plane (if 
   present). Sometimes PST can be instantiated after the transport 
   path is initially created (e.g. PST). 

3.7. P2MP considerations 

   All the traffic sent over a p2mp transport path, including OAM 
   packets generated by a MEP, is sent (multicast) from the root to 
   all the leaves. As a consequence: 

     o To send an OAM packet to all leaves, the source MEP can 
        send a single OAM packet that will be delivered by the 
        forwarding plane to all the leaves and processed by all the 
        leaves. 

     o To send an OAM packet to a single leaf, the source MEP 
        sends a single OAM packet that will be delivered by the 
        forwarding plane to all the leaves but contains sufficient 
        information to identify a target leaf, and therefore is 
        processed only by the target leaf and ignored by the other 
        leaves. 

     o To send an OAM packet to a single MIP, the source MEP sends 
        a single OAM packet with the TTL field indicating the 
        number of hops necessary to reach the node where the MIP

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

        resides. This packet will be delivered by the forwarding 
        plane to all intermediate nodes at the same TTL distance of 
        the target MIP and to any leaf that is located at a shorter 
        distance. The OAM message must contain sufficient 
        information to identify the target MIP and therefore is 
        processed only by the target MIP. The source MEP should 
        also include Target MIP information in the OAM packet to 
        allow proper identification of the node and the MIP the OAM 
        packet is addressed to. 

     o In order to send an OAM packet to M leaves (i.e., a subset 
        of all the leaves), the source MEP sends M different OAM 
        packets targeted to each individual leaf in the group of M 
        leaves. Better mechanisms are outside the scope of this 
        document. 

   P2MP paths are unidirectional, therefore any return path to a 
   source MEP for on demand transactions will be out of band. A 
   mechanism to scope the set of MEPs or MIPs expected to respond 
   to a given "on demand" transaction is useful as it relieves the 
   source MEP of the requirement to filter and discard undesired 
   responses as normally TTL exhaust will address all MIPs at a 
   given distance from the source, and failure to exhaust TTL will 
   address all MEPs. 

4. Reference Model 

   The reference model for the MPLS-TP framework builds upon the 
   concept of a MEG, and its associated MEPs and MIPs, to support 
   the functional requirements specified in [8]. 

   The following MPLS-TP MEGs are specified in this document: 

   o  A Section Maintenance Entity Group (SME), allowing monitoring 
      and management of MPLS-TP Sections (between MPLS LSRs). 

   o  An LSP Maintenance Entity Group (LME), allowing monitoring 
      and management of an end-to-end LSP (between LERs). 

   o  A PW Maintenance Entity Group (PME), allowing monitoring and 
      management of an end-to-end SS/MS-PWs (between T-PEs). 

   o  An LSP Path Segment Tunnel ME Group (LPSTME), allowing 
      monitoring and management of a path segment tunnel (between 
      any LERs/LSRs along an LSP).

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   o  A PW Path Segment Tunnel ME Group (PPSTME), allowing 
      monitoring and management of an MPLS-TP path segment tunnel 
      (between any T-PEs/S-PEs along the (MS-)PW). 

   The MEGs specified in this MPLS-TP framework are compliant with 
   the architecture framework for MPLS-TP MS-PWs [4] and LSPs [1]. 

   Hierarchical LSPs are also supported in the form of path segment 
   tunnels. In this case, each LSP in the hierarchy is a different 
   sub-layer network that can be monitored, independently from 
   higher and lower level LSPs in the hierarchy, on an end-to-end 
   basis (from LER to LER) by a PSTME. It is possible to monitor a 
   portion of a hierarchical LSP by instantiating a hierarchical 
   PSTME between any LERs/LSRs along the hierarchical LSP.

   enabled network domains, Domain 1 and Domain Z. In Domain 1, 
   LSR1 is adjacent to LSR2 via the MPLS Section Sec12 and LSR2 is 
   adjacent to LSR3 via the MPLS Section Sec23. Similarly, in 
   Domain Z, LSRX is adjacent to LSRY via the MPLS Section SecXY 
   and LSRY is adjacent to LSRZ via the MPLS Section SecYZ. In 
   addition, LSR3 is adjacent to LSRX via the MPLS Section 3X. 

   Figure 5 also shows a bi-directional MS-PW (PW1Z) between AC1 on 
   TPE1 and AC2 on TPEZ. The MS-PW consists of three bi-directional 
   PW path segments: 1) PW13 path segment between T-PE1 and S-PE3 
   via the bi-directional LSP13 LSP, 2) PW3X path segment between 
   S-PE3 and S-PEX, via the bi-directional LSP3X LSP, and 3) PWXZ 
   path segment between S-PEX and T-PEZ via the bi-directional 
   LSPXZ LSP. 

   The MPLS-TP OAM procedures that apply to a MEG are expected to 
   operate independently from procedures on other MEGs. Yet, this 
   does not preclude that multiple MEGs may be affected 
   simultaneously by the same network condition, for example, a 
   fiber cut event. 

   Note that there are no constrains imposed by this OAM framework 
   on the number, or type (p2p, p2mp, LSP or PW), of MEGs that may 
   be instantiated on a particular node. In particular, when 
   looking at Figure 3, it should be possible to configure one or 
   more MEPs on the same node if that node is the endpoint of one 
   or more MEGs. 

   Figure 5 does not describe a PW3X PPSTME because typically PSTs 
   are used to monitor an OAM domain (like PW13 and PWXZ PPSTMEs) 
   rather than the segment between two OAM domains. However the OAM 
   framework does not pose any constraints on the way PSTs are 
   instantiated as long as they are not overlapping. 

   The subsections below define the MEGs specified in this MPLS-TP 
   OAM architecture framework document. Unless otherwise stated, 
   all references to domains, LSRs, MPLS Sections, LSPs, 
   pseudowires and MEGs in this section are made in relation to 
   those shown in Figure 5.  

4.1. MPLS-TP Section Monitoring (SME) 

   An MPLS-TP Section ME (SME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity 
   intended to an MPLS Section as defined in [5]. An SME may be 
   configured on any MPLS section. SME OAM packets must fate share 
   with the user data packets sent over the monitored MPLS Section.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   An SME is intended to be deployed for applications where it is 
   preferable to monitor the link between topologically adjacent 
   (next hop in this layer network) MPLS (and MPLS-TP enabled) LSRs 
   rather than monitoring the individual LSP or PW path segments 
   traversing the MPLS Section and the server layer technology does 
   not provide adequate OAM capabilities. 

   Figure 5 shows 5 Section MEs configured in the network between 
   AC1 and AC2: 

   1. Sec12 ME associated with the MPLS Section between LSR 1 and 
      LSR 2, 

   2. Sec23 ME associated with the MPLS Section between LSR 2 and 
      LSR 3, 

   3. Sec3X ME associated with the MPLS Section between LSR 3 and 
      LSR X, 

   4. SecXY ME associated with the MPLS Section between LSR X and 
      LSR Y, and 

   5. SecYZ ME associated with the MPLS Section between LSR Y and 
      LSR Z. 

4.2. MPLS-TP LSP End-to-End Monitoring (LME) 

   An MPLS-TP LSP ME (LME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity 
   intended to monitor an end-to-end LSP between two LERs. An LME 
   may be configured on any MPLS LSP. LME OAM packets must fate 
   share with user data packets sent over the monitored MPLS-TP 
   LSP. 

   An LME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is 
   desirable to monitor an entire LSP between its LERs, rather 
   than, say, monitoring individual PWs. 

   Figure 5 depicts 2 LMEs configured in the network between AC1 
   and AC2: 1) the LSP13 LME between LER 1 and LER 3, and 2) the 
   LSPXZ LME between LER X and LER Y. Note that the presence of a 
   LSP3X LME in such a configuration is optional, hence, not 
   precluded by this framework. For instance, the SPs may prefer to 
   monitor the MPLS-TP Section between the two LSRs rather than the 
   individual LSPs.

4.3. MPLS-TP PW Monitoring (PME) 

   An MPLS-TP PW ME (PME) is an MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended 
   to monitor a SS-PW or MS-PW between a pair of T-PEs. A PME can 
   be configured on any SS-PW or MS-PW. PME OAM packets must fate 
   share with the user data packets sent over the monitored PW. 

   A PME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is 
   desirable to monitor an entire PW between a pair of MPLS-TP 
   enabled T-PEs rather than monitoring the LSP aggregating 
   multiple PWs between PEs.

   segments: PW13, PW3X and PWXZ and its associated end-to-end PME 
   (PW1Z PME). 

4.4. MPLS-TP LSP Path Segment Tunnel Monitoring (LPSTME) 

   An MPLS-TP LSP Path Segment Tunnel ME (LPSTME) is an MPLS-TP LSP 
   with associated maintenance entity intended to monitor an 
   arbitrary part of an LSP between the pair of MEPs instantiated 
   for the PST independent from the end-to-end monitoring (LME). An 
   LPSTMEE can monitor an LSP segment or concatenated segment and 
   it may also include the forwarding engine(s) of the node(s) at 
   the edge(s) of the segment or concatenated segment. 

   Multiple LPSTMEs can be configured on any LSP. The LSRs that 
   terminate the LPSTME may or may not be immediately adjacent at 
   the MPLS-TP layer. LPSTME OAM packets must fate share with the 
   user data packets sent over the monitored LSP path segment.

   A LPSTME can be defined between the following entities: 

   o  The end node and any intermediate node of a given LSP. 

   o  Any two intermediate nodes of a given LSP.  

   An LPSTME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is 
   preferable to monitor the behaviour of a part of an LSP or set 
   of LSPs rather than the entire LSP itself, for example when 
   there is a need to monitor a part of an LSP that extends beyond 
   the administrative boundaries of an MPLS-TP enabled 
   administrative domain.

   LSP1Z consists of, at least, three LSP Concatenated Segments: 
   LSP13, LSP3X and LSPXZ. In this scenario there are two separate 
   LPSTMEs configured to monitor the LSP1Z: 1) a LPSTME monitoring 
   the LSP13 Concatenated Segment on Domain 1 (LSP13 LPSTME), and 
   2) a LPSTME monitoring the LSPXZ Concatenated Segment on Domain 
   Z (LSPXZ LPSTME).

   It is worth noticing that LPSTMEs can coexist with the LME 
   monitoring the end-to-end LSP and that LPSTME MEPs and LME MEPs 
   can be coincident in the same node (e.g. PE1 node supports both 
   the LSP1Z LME MEP and the LSP13 LPSTME MEP). 

4.5. MPLS-TP MS-PW Path Segment Tunnel Monitoring (PPSTME) 

   An MPLS-TP MS-PW Path Segment Tunnel Monitoring ME (PPSTME) is 
   an MPLS-TP maintenance entity intended to monitor an arbitrary 
   part of an MS-PW between a given pair of PEs independently from 
   the end-to-end monitoring (PME). A PPSTME can monitor a PW 
   segment or concatenated segment and it may also include the 
   forwarding engine(s) of the node(s) at the edge(s) of the 
   segment or concatenated segment. 

   S-PE placement is typically dictated by considerations other 
   than OAM. S-PEs will frequently reside at operational boundaries 
   such as the transition from distributed (CP) to centralized 
   (NMS) control or at a routing area boundary. As such the 
   architecture would superficially appear not to have the 
   flexibility that arbitrary placement of PST segments would 
   imply. More arbitrary placement of MEs for a PW would require 
   additional hierarchical components, beyond the PSTs between PEs 
   Multiple PPSTMEs can be configured on any MS-PW. The PEs may or 
   may not be immediately adjacent at the MS-PW layer. PPSTME OAM 
   packets fate share with the user data packets sent over the 
   monitored PW path Segment. 

   A PPSTME can be defined between the following entities: 

   o  T-PE and any S-PE of a given MS-PW 

   o  Any two S-PEs of a given MS-PW. It can span several PW 
      segments.  

   A PPSTME is intended to be deployed in scenarios where it is 
   preferable to monitor the behaviour of a part of a MS-PW rather 
   than the entire end-to-end PW itself, for example to monitor an 
   MS-PW path segment within a given network domain of an inter-
   domain MS-PW.

    Figure 8 MPLS-TP MS-PW Path Segment Tunnel Monitoring (PPSTME) 

   Figure 8 depicts the same MS-PW (MS-PW1Z) between AC1 and AC2 as 
   in Figure 6. In this scenario there are two separate PPSTMEs 
   configured to monitor MS-PW1Z: 1) a PPSTME monitoring the PW13 
   MS-PW path segment on Domain 1 (PW13 PPSTME), and 2) a PPSTME 
   monitoring the PWXZ MS-PW path segment on Domain Z with (PWXZ 
   PPSTME). 

   It is worth noticing that PPSTMEs can coexist with the PME 
   monitoring the end-to-end MS-PW and that PPSTME MEPs and PME 
   MEPs can be coincident in the same node (e.g. TPE1 node supports 
   both the PW1Z PME MEP and the PW13 PPSTME MEP). 

4.6. Fate sharing considerations for multilink 

   Multilink techniques are in use today and are expected to 
   continue to be used in future deployments. These techniques 
   include Ethernet Link Aggregations [14], the use of Link 
   Bundling for MPLS [13] where the option to spread traffic over 
   component links is supported and enabled. While the use of Link 
   Bundling can be controlled at the MPLS-TP layer, use of Link 
   Aggregation (or any server layer specific multilink) is not 
   necessarily under control of the MPLS-TP layer. Other techniques 
   may emerge in the future. These techniques share in common the 
   characteristic that an LSP may be spread over a set of component 
   links and therefore be reordered but no flow within the LSP is 
   reordered (except when very infrequent and minimally disruptive 
   load rebalancing occurs). 

   The use of multilink techniques may be prohibited or permitted 
   in any particular deployment. If multilink techniques are used, 
 
 
Busi et al.            Expires October 21, 2010               [Page 26] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   the deployment can be considered to be only partially MPLS-TP 
   compliant, however this is unlikely to prevent its use. 

   The implications for OAM is that not all components of a 
   multilink will be exercised, independent server layer OAM being 
   required to exercise the aggregated link components. This has 
   further implications for MIP and MEP placement, as per-interface 
   MIPs or "down" MEPs on a multilink interface are akin to a layer 
   violation, as they instrument at the granularity of the server 
   layer. The implications for reduced OAM loss measurement 
   functionality is documented in sections 5.5.3 and 6.2.3. 

5. OAM Functions for proactive monitoring 

   In this document, proactive monitoring refers to OAM operations 
   that are either configured to be carried out periodically and 
   continuously or preconfigured to act on certain events such as 
   alarm signals. 

   Proactive monitoring is frequently "in-service" monitoring. The 
   control and measurement implications are: 

   1. Proactive monitoring for a MEG is typically configured at 
      transport path creation time. 

   2. The operational characteristics of in-band measurement 
      transactions (e.g., CV, LM etc.) are configured at the MEPs. 

   3. Server layer events are reported by transactions originating 
      at intermediate nodes. 

   4. The measurements resulting from proactive monitoring are 
      typically only reported outside of the MEG as unsolicited 
      notifications for "out of profile" events, such as faults or 
      loss measurement indication of excessive impairment of 
      information transfer capability. 

   5. The measurements resulting from proactive monitoring may be 
      periodically harvested by an EMS/NMS. 

   For statically provisioned transport paths the above information 
   is statically configured; for dynamically established transport 
   paths the configuration information is signaled via the control 
   plane or configured via the management plane. 

   The operator enables/disables some of the consequent actions 
   defined in section 5.1.2.

5.1. Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification  

   Proactive Continuity Check functions, as required in section 
   2.2.2 of [8], are used to detect a loss of continuity defect 
   (LOC) between two MEPs in a MEG. 

   Proactive Connectivity Verification functions, as required in 
   section 2.2.3 of [8], are used to detect an unexpected 
   connectivity defect between two MEGs (e.g. mismerging or 
   misconnection), as well as unexpected connectivity within the 
   MEG with an unexpected MEP. 

   Both functions are based on the (proactive) generation of OAM 
   packets by the source MEP that are processed by the sink MEP. As 
   a consequence these two functions are grouped together into 
   Continuity Check and Connectivity Verification (CC-V) OAM 
   packets. 

   In order to perform pro-active Connectivity Verification 
   function, each CC-V OAM packet also includes a globally unique 
   Source MEP identifier. When used to perform only pro-active 
   Continuity Check function, the CC-V OAM packet will not include 
   any globally unique Source MEP identifier. Different formats of 
   MEP identifiers are defined in [7] to address different 
   environments. When MPLS-TP is deployed in transport network 
   environments where IP addressing is not used in the forwarding 
   plane, the ICC-based format for MEP identification is used. When 
   MPLS-TP is deployed in IP-based environment, the IP-based MEP 
   identification is used. 

   As a consequence, it is not possible to detect misconnections 
   between two MEGs monitored only for continuity as neither the 
   OAM message type nor OAM message content provides sufficient 
   information to disambiguate an invalid source. To expand: 

   o  For CC leaking into a CC monitored MEG - undetectable 

   o  For CV leaking into a CC monitored MEG - presence of 
      additional Source MEP identifier allows detecting the fault 

   o  For CC leaking into a CV monitored MEG - lack of additional 
      Source MEP identifier allows detecting the fault. 

   o  For CV leaking into a CV monitored MEG - different Source MEP 
      identifier permits fault to be identified.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   CC-V OAM packets are transmitted at a regular, operator's 
   configurable, rate. The default CC-V transmission periods are 
   application dependent (see section 5.1.3). 

   Proactive CC-V OAM packets are transmitted with the "minimum 
   loss probability PHB" within the transport path (LSP, PW) they 
   are monitoring. This PHB is configurable on network operator's 
   basis. PHBs can be translated at the network borders by the same 
   function that translates it for user data traffic. The 
   implication is that CC-V fate shares with much of the forwarding 
   implementation, but not all aspects of PHB processing are 
   exercised. Either on demand tools are used for finer grained 
   fault finding or an implementation may utilize a CC-V flow per 
   PHB with the entire E-LSP fate sharing with any individual PHB. 

   In a bidirectional point-to-point transport path, when a MEP is 
   enabled to generate pro-active CC-V OAM packets with a 
   configured transmission rate, it also expects to receive pro-
   active CC-V OAM packets from its peer MEP at the same 
   transmission rate as a common SLA applies to all components of 
   the transport path. In a unidirectional transport path (either 
   point-to-point or point-to-multipoint), only the source MEP is 
   enabled to generate CC-V OAM packets and only the sink MEP is 
   configured to expect these packets at the configured rate. 

   MIPs, as well as intermediate nodes not supporting MPLS-TP OAM, 
   are transparent to the pro-active CC-V information and forward 
   these pro-active CC-V OAM packets as regular data packets. 

   During path setup and tear down, situations arise where CC-V 
   checks would give rise to alarms, as the path is not fully 
   instantiated. In order to avoid these spurious alarms the 
   following procedures are recommended. At initialization, the MEP 
   source function (generating pro-active CC-V packets) should be 
   enabled prior to the corresponding MEP sink function (detecting 
   continuity and connectivity defects).  When disabling the CC-V 
   proactive functionality, the MEP sink function should be 
   disabled prior to the corresponding MEP source function. 

5.1.1. Defects identified by CC-V 

   Pro-active CC-V functions allow a sink MEP to detect the defect 
   conditions described in the following sub-sections. For all of 
   the described defect cases, the sink MEP should notify the 
   equipment fault management process of the detected defect.

5.1.1.1. Loss Of Continuity defect  

   When proactive CC-V is enabled, a sink MEP detects a loss of 
   continuity (LOC) defect when it fails to receive pro-active CC-V 
   OAM packets from the peer MEP. 

   o  Entry criteria:  if no pro-active CC-V OAM packets from the 
      peer MEP with the correct encapsulation (and in the case of 
      CV, this includes the requirement to have a correct globally 
      unique Source MEP identifier) are received within the 
      interval equal to 3.5 times the receiving MEP's configured 
      CC-V reception period. 

   o  Exit criteria: a pro-active CC-V OAM packet from the peer MEP 
      with the correct encapsulation (and again in the case of CV, 
      with the correct globally unique Source MEP identifier) is 
      received. 

5.1.1.2. Mis-connectivity defect 

   When a pro-active CC-V OAM packet is received, a sink MEP 
   identifies a mis-connectivity defect (e.g. mismerge, 
   misconnection or unintended looping) with its peer source MEP 
   when the received packet carries an incorrect globally unique 
   Source MEP identifier. 

   o  Entry criteria: the sink MEP receives a pro-active CC-V OAM 
      packet with an incorrect globally unique Source MEP 
      identifier. 

   o  Exit criteria: the sink MEP does not receive any pro-active 
      CC-V OAM packet with an incorrect globally unique Source MEP 
      identifier for an interval equal at least to 3.5 times the 
      longest transmission period of the pro-active CC-V OAM 
      packets received with an incorrect globally unique Source MEP 
      identifier since this defect has been raised. This requires 
      the OAM message to self identify the CC-V periodicity as not 
      all MEPs can be expected to have knowledge of all MEGs. 

5.1.1.3. Period Misconfiguration defect 

   If pro-active CC-V OAM packets are received with a correct 
   globally unique Source MEP identifier but with a transmission 
   period different than the locally configured reception period, 
   then a CV period mis-configuration defect is detected.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   o  Entry criteria: a MEP receives a CC-V pro-active packet with 
      correct globally unique Source MEP identifier but with a 
      Period field value different than its own CC-V configured 
      transmission period.  

   o  Exit criteria: the sink MEP does not receive any pro-active 
      CC-V OAM packet with a correct globally unique Source MEP 
      identifier and an incorrect transmission period for an 
      interval equal at least to 3.5 times the longest transmission 
      period of the pro-active CC-V OAM packets received with a 
      correct globally unique Source MEP identifier and an 
      incorrect transmission period since this defect has been 
      raised. 

5.1.2. Consequent action 

   A sink MEP that detects one of the defect conditions defined in 
   section 5.1.1 performs the following consequent actions. 

   If a MEP detects an unexpected globally unique Source MEP 
   Identifier, it blocks all the traffic (including also the user 
   data packets) that it receives from the misconnected transport 
   path. 

   If a MEP detects LOC defect that is not caused by a period 
   mis-configuration, it should block all the traffic (including 
   also the user data packets) that it receives from the transport 
   path, if this consequent action has been enabled by the 
   operator. 

   It is worth noticing that the OAM requirements document [8] 
   recommends that CC-V proactive monitoring be enabled on every 
   MEG in order to reliably detect connectivity defects. However, 
   CC-V proactive monitoring can be disabled by an operator for a 
   MEG. In the event of a misconnection between a transport path 
   that is pro-actively monitored for CC-V and a transport path 
   which is not, the MEP of the former transport path will detect a 
   LOC defect representing a connectivity problem (e.g. a 
   misconnection with a transport path where CC-V proactive 
   monitoring is not enabled) instead of a continuity problem, with 
   a consequent wrong traffic delivering. For these reasons, the 
   traffic block consequent action is applied even when a LOC 
   condition occurs. This block consequent action can be disabled 
   through configuration. This deactivation of the block action may 
   be used for activating or deactivating the monitoring when it is 
   not possible to synchronize the function activation of the two 
   peer MEPs.

   If a MEP detects a LOC defect (section 5.1.1.1), a 
   mis-connectivity defect (section 5.1.1.2) or a period 
   misconfiguration defect (section 5.1.1.3), it declares a signal 
   fail condition at the transport path level. 

5.1.3. Configuration considerations 

   At all MEPs inside a MEG, the following configuration 
   information needs to be configured when a proactive CC-V 
   function is enabled: 

   o  MEG ID; the MEG identifier to which the MEP belongs; 

   o  MEP-ID; the MEP's own identity inside the MEG; 

   o  list of peer MEPs inside the MEG. For a point-to-point MEG 
      the list would consist of the single peer MEP ID from which 
      the OAM packets are expected. In case of the root MEP of a 
      p2mp MEG, the list is composed by all the leaf MEP IDs inside 
      the MEG. In case of the leaf MEP of a p2mp MEG, the list is 
      composed by the root MEP ID (i.e. each leaf needs to know the 
      root MEP ID from which it expect to receive the CC-V OAM 
      packets). 

   o  PHB; it identifies the per-hop behaviour of CC-V packet. 
      Proactive CC-V packets are transmitted with the "minimum loss 
      probability PHB" previously configured within a single 
      network operator. This PHB is configurable on network 
      operator's basis. PHBs can be translated at the network 
      borders.  

   o  transmission rate; the default CC-V transmission periods are 
      application dependent (depending on whether they are used to 
      support fault management, performance monitoring, or 
      protection switching applications): 

       o Fault Management: default transmission period is 1s (i.e. 
          transmission rate of 1 packet/second). 

       o Performance Monitoring: default transmission period is 
          100ms (i.e. transmission rate of 10 packets/second). 
          Performance monitoring is only relevant when the 
          transport path is defect free. CC-V contributes to the 
          accuracy of PM statistics by permitting the defect free 
          periods to be properly distinguished.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

       o Protection Switching: default transmission period is 
          3.33ms (i.e. transmission rate of 300 packets/second), in 
          order to achieve sub-50ms the CC-V defect entry criteria 
          should resolve in less than 10msec, and complete a 
          protection switch within a subsequent period of 50 msec. 
          It is also possible to lengthen the transmission period 
          to 10ms (i.e. transmission rate of 100 packets/second): 
          in this case the CC-V defect entry criteria resolves is 
          longer (i.e. 30msec). 

   It should be possible for the operator to configure these 
   transmission rates for all applications, to satisfy his internal 
   requirements. 

   Note that the reception period is the same as the configured 
   transmission rate. 

   For statically provisioned transport paths the above information 
   are statically configured; for dynamically established transport 
   paths the configuration information are signaled via the control 
   plane. 

   The operator should be able to enable/disable some of the 
   consequent actions defined in section 5.1.2. 

5.2. Remote Defect Indication  

   The Remote Defect Indication (RDI) function, as required in 
   section 2.2.9 of [8], is an indicator that is transmitted by a 
   MEP to communicate to its peer MEPs that a signal fail condition 
   exists.  RDI is only used for bidirectional connections and is 
   associated with proactive CC-V activation. The RDI indicator is 
   piggy-backed onto the CC-V packet. 

   When a MEP detects a signal fail condition (e.g. in case of a 
   continuity or connectivity defect), it should begin transmitting 
   an RDI indicator to its peer MEP.  The RDI information will be 
   included in all pro-active CC-V packets that it generates for 
   the duration of the signal fail condition's existence. 

   A MEP that receives the packets with the RDI information should 
   determine that its peer MEP has encountered a defect condition 
   associated with a signal fail. 

   MIPs as well as intermediate nodes not supporting MPLS-TP OAM 
   are transparent to the RDI indicator and forward these proactive 
   CC-V packets that include the RDI indicator as regular data 
 
 
Busi et al.            Expires October 21, 2010               [Page 33] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   packets, i.e. the MIP should not perform any actions nor examine 
   the indicator. 

   When the signal fail defect condition clears, the MEP should 
   clear the RDI indicator from subsequent transmission of pro-
   active CC-V packets.  A MEP should clear the RDI defect upon 
   reception of a pro-active CC-V packet from the source MEP with 
   the RDI indicator cleared. 

5.2.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support RDI indication, this may be a unique OAM 
   message or an OAM information element embedded in a CV message. 
   In this case the RDI transmission rate and PHB of the OAM 
   packets carrying RDI should be the same as that configured for 
   CC-V. 

5.3. Alarm Reporting  

   The Alarm Reporting function, as required in section 2.2.8 of 
   [8], relies upon an Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) message to 
   suppress alarms following detection of defect conditions at the 
   server (sub-)layer. 

   When a server MEP asserts signal fail, the MPLS-TP client 
   (sub-)layer adaptation function generates packets with AIS 
   information in the downstream direction to allow the suppression 
   of secondary alarms at the MEP in the client (sub-)layer. 

   The generation of packets with AIS information starts 
   immediately when the server MEP asserts signal fail. These 
   periodic packets, with AIS information, continue to be 
   transmitted until the signal fail condition is cleared. 

   Upon receiving a packet with AIS information an MPLS-TP MEP 
   enters an AIS defect condition and suppresses loss of continuity 
   alarms associated with its peer MEP. A MEP resumes loss of 
   continuity alarm generation upon detecting loss of continuity 
   defect conditions in the absence of AIS condition. 

   For example, let's consider a fiber cut between LSR 1 and LSR 2 
   in the reference network of Figure 5. Assuming that all the MEGs 
   described in Figure 5 have pro-active CC-V enabled, a LOC defect 
   is detected by the MEPs of Sec12 SME, LSP13 LME, PW1 PPSTME and 
   PW1Z PME, however in transport network only the alarm associate 
   to the fiber cut needs to be reported to NMS while all these 

 
 
Busi et al.            Expires October 21, 2010               [Page 34] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   secondary alarms should be suppressed (i.e. not reported to the 
   NMS or reported as secondary alarms). 

   If the fiber cut is detected by the MEP in the physical layer 
   (in LSR2), LSR2 can generate the proper alarm in the physical 
   layer and suppress the secondary alarm associated with the LOC 
   defect detected on Sec12 SME. As both MEPs reside within the 
   same node, this process does not involve any external protocol 
   exchange. Otherwise, if the physical layer has not enough OAM 
   capabilities to detect the fiber cut, the MEP of Sec12 SME in 
   LSR2 will report a LOC alarm. 

   In both cases, the MEP of Sec12 SME in LSR 2 notifies the 
   adaptation function for LSP13 LME that then generates AIS 
   packets on the LSP13 LME in order to allow its MEP in LSR3 to 
   suppress the LOC alarm. LSR3 can also suppress the secondary 
   alarm on PW13 PPSTME because the MEP of PW13 PPSTME resides 
   within the same node as the MEP of LSP13 LME. The MEP of PW13 
   PPSTME in LSR3 also notifies the adaptation function for PW1Z 
   PME that then generates AIS packets on PW1Z PME in order to 
   allow its MEP in LSRZ to suppress the LOC alarm. 

   The generation of AIS packets for each MEG in the MPLS-TP client 
   (sub-)layer is configurable (i.e. the operator can 
   enable/disable the AIS generation). 

   AIS packets are transmitted with the "minimum loss probability 
   PHB" within a single network operator. This PHB is configurable 
   on network operator's basis. 

   A MIP is transparent to packets with AIS information and 
   therefore does not require any information to support AIS 
   functionality. 

5.4. Lock Reporting 

   The Lock Reporting function, as required in section 2.2.7 of 
   [8], relies upon a Locked Report (LKR) message used to suppress 
   alarms following administrative locking action in the server 
   (sub-)layer. 

   When a server MEP is locked or receives a lock report, the 
   MPLS-TP client (sub-)layer adaptation function generates packets 
   with LKR information in both directions to allow the suppression 
   of secondary alarms at the MEPs in the client (sub-)layer. 


 
 
Busi et al.            Expires October 21, 2010               [Page 35] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   The generation of packets with LKR information starts 
   immediately when the server MEP is locked. These periodic 
   packets, with LKR information, continue to be transmitted until 
   the locked condition is cleared. 

   Upon receiving a packet with LKR information an MPLS-TP MEP 
   enters an LKR defect condition and suppresses loss of continuity 
   alarm associated with its peer MEP. A MEP resumes loss of 
   continuity alarm generation upon detecting loss of continuity 
   defect conditions in the absence of LKR condition. 

   The generation of LKR packets for each MEG in the MPLS-TP client 
   (sub-)layer is configurable (i.e. the operator can 
   enable/disable the LKR generation). 

   LKR packets are transmitted with the "minimum loss probability 
   PHB" within a single network operator. This PHB is configurable 
   on network operator's basis. 

   A MIP is transparent to packets with LKR information and 
   therefore does not require any information to support LKR 
   functionality. 

5.5. Packet Loss Measurement  

   Packet Loss Measurement (LM) is one of the capabilities 
   supported by the MPLS-TP Performance Monitoring (PM) function in 
   order to facilitate reporting of QoS information for a transport 
   path as required in section 2.2.11 of [8]. LM is used to 
   exchange counter values for the number of ingress and egress 
   packets transmitted and received by the transport path monitored 
   by a pair of MEPs.   

   Proactive LM is performed by periodically sending LM OAM packets 
   from a MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving LM OAM packets from 
   the peer MEP (if a bidirectional transport path) during the life 
   time of the transport path. Each MEP performs measurements of 
   its transmitted and received packets. These measurements are 
   then transactionally correlated with the peer MEP in the ME to 
   derive the impact of packet loss on a number of performance 
   metrics for the ME in the MEG. The LM transactions are issued 
   such that the OAM packets will experience the same queuing 
   discipline as the measured traffic while transiting between the 
   MEPs in the ME. 

   In order to support proactive LM, the transmission rate and PHB    
   associated with the LM OAM packets originating from a MEP need 
 
 
Busi et al.            Expires October 21, 2010               [Page 36] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   be configured as part of the LM provisioning procedures. LM OAM 
   packets are transmitted with the same PHB class that the LM is 
   intended to measure. If that PHB is not an ordered aggregate 
   where the ordering constraint is all packets with the PHB class 
   being delivered in order, LM can produce inconsistent results. 

   For a MEP, near-end packet loss refers to packet loss associated 
   with incoming data packets (from the far-end MEP) while far-end 
   packet loss refers to packet loss associated with egress data 
   packets (towards the far-end MEP).  

5.5.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support proactive LM, the transmission rate and PHB 
   associated with the LM OAM packets originating from a MEP need 
   be configured as part of the LM provisioning procedures. LM OAM 
   packets should be transmitted with the same PHB class that the 
   LM is intended to measure. If that PHB is not an ordered 
   aggregate where the ordering constraint is all packets with the 
   PHB being delivered in order, LM can produce inconsistent 
   results. 

5.5.2. Sampling skew 

   If an implementation makes use of a hardware forwarding path 
   which operates in parallel with an OAM processing path, whether 
   hardware or software based, the packet and byte counts may be 
   skewed if one or more packets can be processed before the OAM 
   processing samples counters. If OAM is implemented in software 
   this error can be quite large. 

5.5.3. Multilink issues 

   If multilink is used at the LSP ingress or egress, there may be 
   no single packet processing engine where to inject or extract a 
   LM packet as an atomic operation to which accurate packet and 
   byte counts can be associated with the packet. 

   In the case where multilink is encountered in the LSP path, the 
   reordering of packets within the LSP can cause inaccurate LM 
   results. 

5.6. Packet Delay Measurement  

   Packet Delay Measurement (DM) is one of the capabilities 
   supported by the MPLS-TP PM function in order to facilitate 
   reporting of QoS information for a transport path as required in 
 
 
Busi et al.            Expires October 21, 2010               [Page 37] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   section 2.2.12 of [8]. Specifically, pro-active DM is used to 
   measure the long-term packet delay and packet delay variation in 
   the transport path monitored by a pair of MEPs.   

   Proactive DM is performed by sending periodic DM OAM packets 
   from a MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving DM OAM packets from 
   the peer MEP (if a bidirectional transport path) during a 
   configurable time interval.  

   Pro-active DM can be operated in two ways: 

   o  One-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet to its peer MEP containing 
      all the required information to facilitate one-way packet 
      delay and/or one-way packet delay variation measurements at 
      the peer MEP. Note that this requires synchronized precision 
      time at either MEP by means outside the scope of this 
      framework. 

   o  Two-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet with a DM request to its 
      peer MEP, which replies with a DM OAM packet as a DM 
      response. The request/response DM OAM packets containing all 
      the required information to facilitate two-way packet delay 
      and/or two-way packet delay variation measurements from the 
      viewpoint of the source MEP. 

5.6.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support pro-active DM, the transmission rate and PHB 
   associated with the DM OAM packets originating from a MEP need 
   be configured as part of the DM provisioning procedures. DM OAM 
   packets should be transmitted with the PHB that yields the 
   lowest packet loss performance among the PHB Scheduling Classes 
   or Ordered Aggregates (see RFC 3260 [12]) in the monitored 
   transport path for the relevant network domain(s). 

5.7. Client Failure Indication  

   The Client Failure Indication (CFI) function, as required in 
   section 2.2.10 of [8], is used to help process client defects 
   and propagate a client signal defect condition from the process 
   associated with the local attachment circuit where the defect 
   was detected (typically the source adaptation function for the 
   local client interface) to the process associated with the far-
   end attachment circuit (typically the source adaptation function 
   for the far-end client interface) for the same transmission path 
   in case the client of the transport path does not support a 
   native defect/alarm indication mechanism, e.g. AIS. 
 
 
Busi et al.            Expires October 21, 2010               [Page 38] 

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   A source MEP starts transmitting a CFI indication to its peer 
   MEP when it receives a local client signal defect notification 
   via its local CSF function. Mechanisms to detect local client 
   signal fail defects are technology specific. 

   A sink MEP that has received a CFI indication report this 
   condition to its associated client process via its local CFI 
   function. Consequent actions toward the client attachment 
   circuit are technology specific. 

   Either there needs to be a 1:1 correspondence between the client 
   and the MEG, or when multiple clients are multiplexed over a 
   transport path, the CFI message requires additional information 
   to permit the client instance to be identified. 

5.7.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support CFI indication, the CFI transmission rate 
   and PHB of the CFI OAM message/information element should be 
   configured as part of the CFI configuration.  

6. OAM Functions for on-demand monitoring 

   In contrast to proactive monitoring, on-demand monitoring is 
   initiated manually and for a limited amount of time, usually for 
   operations such as e.g. diagnostics to investigate into a defect 
   condition. 

   On-demand monitoring covers a combination of "in-service" and 
   "out-of-service" monitoring functions. The control and 
   measurement implications are: 

   1. A MEG can be directed to perform an "on-demand" functions at 
      arbitrary times in the lifetime of a transport path. 

   2. "out-of-service" monitoring functions may require a-priori 
      configuration of both MEPs and intermediate nodes in the MEG 
      (e.g., data plane loopback) and the issuance of notifications 
      into client layers of the transport path being removed from 
      service (e.g., lock-reporting) 

   3. The measurements resulting from on-demand monitoring are 
      typically harvested in real time, as these are frequently 
      craftsperson initiated and attended. These do not necessarily 
      require different harvesting mechanisms that that for 
      harvesting proactive monitoring telemetry.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   The functions that are exclusive out-of-service are those 
   described in section 6.3. The remainder are applicable to both 
   in-service and out-of-service transport paths. 

6.1. Connectivity Verification  

   In order to preserve network resources, e.g. bandwidth, 
   processing time at switches, it may be preferable to not use 
   proactive CC-V. In order to perform fault management functions, 
   network management may invoke periodic on-demand bursts of on-
   demand CV packets, as required in section 2.2.3 of [8]. 

   Use of on-demand CV is dependent on the existence of either a 
   bi-directional ME, or an associated return ME, or the 
   availability of an out of band return path because it requires 
   the ability for target MIPs and MEPs to direct responses to the 
   originating MEPs. 

   An additional use of on-demand CV would be to detect and locate 
   a problem of connectivity when a problem is suspected or known 
   based on other tools.  In this case the functionality will be 
   triggered by the network management in response to a status 
   signal or alarm indication. 

   On-demand CV is based upon generation of on-demand CV packets 
   that should uniquely identify the MEG that is being checked.  
   The on-demand functionality may be used to check either an 
   entire MEG (end-to-end) or between a MEP to a specific MIP. This 
   functionality may not be available for associated bidirectional 
   transport paths or unidirectional paths, as the MIP may not have 
   a return path to the source MEP for the on-demand CV 
   transaction. 

   On-demand CV may generate a one-time burst of on-demand CV 
   packets, or be used to invoke periodic, non-continuous, bursts 
   of on-demand CV packets.  The number of packets generated in 
   each burst is configurable at the MEPs, and should take into 
   account normal packet-loss conditions.  

   When invoking a periodic check of the MEG, the source MEP should 
   issue a burst of on-demand CV packets that uniquely identifies 
   the MEG being verified.  The number of packets and their 
   transmission rate should be pre-configured and known to both the 
   source MEP and the target MEP or MIP.  The source MEP should use 
   the mechanisms defined in sections 3.3 and 3.4 when sending an 
   on-demand CV packet to a target MEP or target MIP respectively. 
   The target MEP/MIP shall return a reply on-demand CV packet for

   each packet received.  If the expected number of on-demand CV 
   reply packets is not received at source MEP, the LOC defect 
   state is entered. 

   On demand CV should have the ability to carry padding such that 
   a variety of MTU sizes can be originated to verify the MTU 
   capacity of the transport path. 

6.1.1. Configuration considerations 

   For on-demand CV the MEP should support the configuration of the 
   number of packets to be transmitted/received in each burst of 
   transmissions and their packet size. The transmission rate 
   should be configured between the different nodes. 

   In addition, when the CV packet is used to check connectivity 
   toward a target MIP, the number of hops to reach the target MIP 
   should be configured. 

   The PHB of the on-demand CV packets should be configured as 
   well. This permits the verification of correct operation of QoS 
   queuing as well as connectivity. 

6.2. Packet Loss Measurement  

   On-demand Packet Loss Measurement (LM) is one of the 
   capabilities supported by the MPLS-TP Performance Monitoring 
   function in order to facilitate diagnostic of QoS performance 
   for a transport path, as required in section 2.2.11 of [8]. As 
   proactive LM, on-demand LM is used to exchange counter values 
   for the number of ingress and egress packets transmitted and 
   received by the transport path monitored by a pair of MEPs.   

   On-demand LM is performed by periodically sending LM OAM packets 
   from a MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving LM OAM packets from 
   the peer MEP (if a bidirectional transport path) during a pre-
   defined monitoring period. Each MEP performs measurements of its 
   transmitted and received packets. These measurements are then 
   correlated evaluate the packet loss performance metrics of the 
   transport path. 

   Use of packet loss measurement in an out-of-service transport 
   path requires a traffic source such as a tester.

6.2.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support on-demand LM, the beginning and duration of 
   the LM procedures, the transmission rate and PHB associated with 
   the LM OAM packets originating from a MEP must be configured as 
   part of the on-demand LM provisioning procedures. LM OAM packets 
   should be transmitted with the PHB that yields the lowest packet 
   loss performance among the PHB Scheduling Classes or Ordered 
   Aggregates (see RFC 3260 [12]) in the monitored transport path 
   for the relevant network domain(s).  

6.2.2. Sampling skew 

   If an implementation makes use of a hardware forwarding path 
   which operates in parallel with an OAM processing path, whether 
   hardware or software based, the packet and byte counts may be 
   skewed if one or more packets can be processed before the OAM 
   processing samples counters.  If OAM is implemented in software 
   this error can be quite large. 

6.2.3. Multilink issues 

   Multi-link Issues are as described in section 5.5.3. 

6.3. Diagnostic Tests  

6.3.1. Throughput Estimation 

   Throughput estimation is an on-demand out-of-service function, 
   as required in section 2.2.5 of [8], that allows verifying the 
   bandwidth/throughput of an MPLS-TP transport path (LSP or PW) 
   before it is put in-service. 

   Throughput estimation is performed between MEPs and can be 
   performed in one-way or two-way modes. 

   This test is performed by sending OAM test packets at increasing 
   rate (up to the theoretical maximum), graphing the percentage of 
   OAM test packets received and reporting the rate at which OAM 
   test packets begin to drop. In general, this rate is dependent 
   on the OAM test packet size. 

   When configured to perform such tests, a MEP source inserts OAM 
   test packets with test information with specified throughput, 
   packet size and transmission patterns.

Internet-Draft          MPLS-TP OAM Framework                April 2010 
    

   For one-way test, remote MEP sink receives the OAM test packets 
   and calculates the packet loss. For two-way test, the remote MEP 
   loopbacks the OAM test packets back to original MEP and the 
   local MEP sink calculates the packet loss. However, a two-way 
   test will return the minimum of available throughput in the two 
   directions. Alternatively it is possible to run two individual 
   one-way tests to get a distinct measurement in the two 
   directions. 

6.3.1.1. Configuration considerations 

   Throughput estimation is an out-of-service tool. The diagnosed 
   MEG should be put into a Lock status before the diagnostic test 
   is started. 

   A MEG can be put into a Lock status either via NMS action or 
   using the Lock Instruct OAM tool as defined in section 7. 

   At the transmitting MEP, provisioning is required for a test 
   signal generator, which is associated with the MEP. At a 
   receiving MEP, provisioning is required for a test signal 
   detector which is associated with the MEP.   

   A MIP is transparent to the OAM test packets sent for throught 
   estimation and therefore does not require any provisioning to 
   support MPLS-TP throughput estimation. 

6.3.1.2. Limited OAM processing rate 

   If an implementation is able to process payload at much higher 
   data rates than OAM packets, then accurate measurement of 
   throughput using OAM packets is not achievable.  Whether OAM 
   packets can be processed at the same rate as payload is 
   implementation dependent. 

6.3.1.3. Multilink considerations 

   If multilink is used, then it may not be possible to perform 
   throughput measurement, as the throughput test may not have a 
   mechanism for utilizing more than one component link of the 
   aggregated link. 

6.3.2. Data plane Loopback 

   Data plane loopback is an out-of-service function, as required 
   in section 2.2.5 of [8], that permits all traffic (including 
   user data and OAM) originated at the ingress of a transport path 
 
 
Busi et al.            Expires October 21, 2010               [Page 43]

   or inserted by the test equipment to be looped back in the 
   direction of the point of origin by an interface at either an 
   intermediate node or a terminating node. TTL is decremented 
   normally during this process. 

   If the loopback function is to be performed at an intermediate 
   node it is only applicable to co-routed bi-directional paths. If 
   the loopback is to be performed end to end, it is applicable to 
   both co-routed bi-directional or associated bi-directional 
   paths. 

   Where a node implements data plane loopback capability and 
   whether it implements more than one point is implementation 
   dependent. 

6.4. Route Tracing 

   It is often necessary to trace a route covered by a MEG from a 
   source MEP to the sink MEP including all the MIPs in-between 
   after e.g., provisioning an MPLS-TP transport path or for 
   trouble shooting purposes, it. 

   The route tracing function, as required in section 2.2.4 of [8], 
   is providing this functionality. Based on the fate sharing 
   requirement of OAM flows, i.e. OAM packets receive the same 
   forwarding treatment as data packet, route tracing is a basic 
   means to perform connectivity verification and, to a much lesser 
   degree, continuity check. For this function to work properly, a 
   return path must be present. 

   Route tracing might be implemented in different ways and this 
   document does not preclude any of them. 

   Route tracing should always discover the full list of MIPs and 
   of the peer MEPs. In case a defect exist, the route trace 
   function needs to be able to detect it and stop automatically 
   returning the incomplete list of OAM entities that it was able 
   to trace. 

6.4.1. Configuration considerations 

   The configuration of the route trace function must at least 
   support the setting of the number of trace attempts before it 
   gives up.

6.5. Packet Delay Measurement 

   Packet Delay Measurement (DM) is one of the capabilities 
   supported by the MPLS-TP PM function in order to facilitate 
   reporting of QoS information for a transport path, as required 
   in section 2.2.12 of [8]. Specifically, on-demand DM is used to 
   measure packet delay and packet delay variation in the transport 
   path monitored by a pair of MEPs during a pre-defined monitoring 
   period.   

   On-Demand DM is performed by sending periodic DM OAM packets 
   from a MEP to a peer MEP and by receiving DM OAM packets from 
   the peer MEP (if a bidirectional transport path) during a 
   configurable time interval.  

   On-demand DM can be operated in two ways: 

   o  One-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet to its peer MEP containing 
      all the required information to facilitate one-way packet 
      delay and/or one-way packet delay variation measurements at 
      the peer MEP. 

   o  Two-way: a MEP sends DM OAM packet with a DM request to its 
      peer MEP, which replies with an DM OAM packet as a DM 
      response. The request/response DM OAM packets containing all 
      the required information to facilitate two-way packet delay 
      and/or two-way packet delay variation measurements from the 
      viewpoint of the source MEP. 

6.5.1. Configuration considerations 

   In order to support on-demand DM, the beginning and duration of 
   the DM procedures, the transmission rate and PHB associated with 
   the DM OAM packets originating from a MEP need be configured as 
   part of the LM provisioning procedures. DM OAM packets should be 
   transmitted with the PHB that yields the lowest packet delay 
   performance among the PHB Scheduling Classes or Ordering 
   Aggregates (see RFC 3260 [12]) in the monitored transport path 
   for the relevant network domain(s). 

   In order to verify different performances between long and short 
   packets (e.g., due to the processing time), it should be 
   possible for the operator to configure of the on-demand OAM DM 
   packet.

7. OAM Functions for administration control 

7.1. Lock Instruct 

   Lock Instruct (LKI) function, as required in section 2.2.6 of 
   [8], is a command allowing a MEP to instruct the peer MEP(s) to 
   put the MPLS-TP transport path into a locked condition. 

   This function allows single-side provisioning for 
   administratively locking (and unlocking) an MPLS-TP transport 
   path. 

   Note that it is also possible to administratively lock (and 
   unlock) an MPLS-TP transport path using two-side provisioning, 
   where the NMS administratively put both MEPs into ad 
   administrative lock condition. In this case, the LKI function is 
   not required/used. 

7.1.1. Locking a transport path 

   A MEP, upon receiving a single-side administrative lock command 
   from NMS, sends an LKI request OAM packet to its peer MEP(s). It 
   also puts the MPLS-TP transport path into a locked and notify 
   its client (sub-)layer adaptation function upon the locked 
   condition. 

   A MEP, upon receiving an LKI request from its peer MEP, can 
   accept or not the instruction and replies to the peer MEP with 
   an LKI reply OAM packet indicating whether it has accepted or 
   not the instruction. 

   If the lock instruction has been accepted, it also puts the 
   MPLS-TP transport path into a locked and notify its client 
   (sub-)layer adaptation function upon the locked condition. 

   Note that if the client (sub-)layer is also MPLS-TP, Lock 
   Reporting (LKR) generation at the client MPLS-TP (sub-)layer is 
   started, as described in section 5.4. 

7.1.2. Unlocking a transport path 

   A MEP, upon receiving a single-side administrative unlock 
   command from NMS, sends an LKI removal request OAM packet to its 
   peer MEP(s). 

   The peer MEP, upon receiving an LKI removal request, can accept 
   or not the removal instruction and replies with an LKI removal

   reply OAM packet indicating whether it has accepted or not the 
   instruction. 

   If the lock removal instruction has been accepted, it also 
   clears the locked condition on the MPLS-TP transport path and 
   notify this event to its client (sub-)layer adaptation function. 

   The MEP that has initiated the LKI clear procedure, upon 
   receiving a positive LKI removal reply, also clears the locked 
   condition on the MPLS-TP transport path and notify this event to 
   its client (sub-)layer adaptation function. 

   Note that if the client (sub-)layer is also MPLS-TP, Lock 
   Reporting (LKR) generation at the client MPLS-TP (sub-)layer is 
   terminated, as described in section 5.4. 

8. Security Considerations 

   A number of security considerations are important in the context 
   of OAM applications.  

   OAM traffic can reveal sensitive information such as passwords, 
   performance data and details about e.g. the network topology. 
   The nature of OAM data therefore suggests to have some form of 
   authentication, authorization and encryption in place. This will 
   prevent unauthorized access to vital equipment and it will 
   prevent third parties from learning about sensitive information 
   about the transport network. However it should be observed that 
   the combination of all permutations of unique MEP to MEP, MEP to 
   MIP, and intermediate system originated transactions mitigates 
   against the practical establishment and maintenance of a large 
   number of security associations per MEG. 

   For this reason it is assumed that the network is physically 
   secured against man in the middle attacks. Further, this 
   document describes OAM functions that, if a man in the middle 
   attack was possible, could be exploited to significantly disrupt 
   proper operation of the network. 

   Mechanisms that the framework does not specify might be subject 
   to additional security considerations. 

9. IANA Considerations 

   No new IANA considerations.
