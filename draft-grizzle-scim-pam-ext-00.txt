            SCIM Extension for Privileged Access Management
                     draft-grizzle-scim-pam-ext-00

Abstract

   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
   [RFC7643] provides schemas that represent common identity information
   about users and groups.  Privileged Access Management (PAM) software
   typically makes use of common user and group models - as well as
   defining additional constructs - to provide fine-grained
   authorization and management for privileged access.

   This document contains a SCIM 2.0 extension for Privileged Access
   Management, which includes extensions to the core User and Group
   objects, and new resource types and schemas for standard Privileged
   Access Management constructs.  This extension is intended to provide
   greater interoperability between PAM software and clients, a common
   language for PAM concepts, and a baseline that can be further
   extended to support more complex PAM requirements.

1.  Overview

   Most Privileged Access Management (PAM) software contains external
   APIs that can be used to manage users, groups, privileged access, and
   authorization to privileged data.  However, these APIs are not
   consistent across different software (e.g. - some software uses REST
   and some uses SOAP), and each API exposes different functionality.
   This makes it difficult for a client to externally manage multiple
   PAM providers.

   The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification
   provides schemas that represent common identity information about
   users and groups.  Privileged Access Management (PAM) software
   typically makes use of common user and group models - as well as
   defining additional constructs - to provide fine-grained
   authorization and management for privileged access.

   This document contains a SCIM 2.0 extension for Privileged Access
   Management, which includes extensions to the core User and Group
   objects, and new resource types and schemas for standard Privileged
   Access Management constructs.  This extension is intended to provide
   greater interoperability between PAM software and clients, a common
   language for PAM concepts, and a baseline that can be further
   extended to support more complex PAM requirements.

   Some providers may not support all of the endpoints or data that is
   described in this extension.  When this is encountered, the PAM
   provider can safely treat endpoints or data as optional.

1.1.  Definitions

   User:  A user account that can be used to access the PAM system to
      manage or access privileged data.  This user can either exist only
      in the PAM system or can be an external user that is defined in
      another system (e.g. - Active Directory or LDAP).

   Group:  A group of users or other groups that can be used to govern
      access within the PAM system.  This group can either exist only in
      the PAM system or can be an external group that is defined in
      another system (e.g. - Active Directory or LDAP).

   Container:  A Container is a logical grouping of privileged data
      (credentials, etc...) that can be used for organizational or
      operational purposes.  Access control lists (ACLs) can be applied
      to a container to control which users and groups have permissions
      to the privileged data in the container.

Internet-Draft        draft-grizzle-scim-pam-ext-00       September 2017


   Privileged Data:  Privileged data is secret information that is
      protected by the PAM system (e.g. - credentials for a privileged
      account, an SSH key, etc...).  Privileged data MAY be stored
      inside of a Container, but does not have to be.  Access control
      lists (ACLs) can be applied to privileged data to control which
      users and groups have permissions to the privileged data.  More
      often, the ACL information is inherited from the container.

   Access Control List (ACL):  An access control list can be associated
      with a Container or Privileged Data.  This contains information
      about which users and groups have access to the Container or
      Privileged Data, and what rights they have.

   External Store:  An external store is a system that contains users
      and groups (e.g. - Active Directory or LDAP) that can be used by a
      PAM system.  This allows using existing infrastructure and group
      definitions to provide authorization, authentication, and
      information within a PAM system.

1.2.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] .

   Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are
   to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages,
   the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.

2.  Core Schema Extensions

   In a PAM system, users and groups can either be locally or externally
   defined.  When local, the user or group exists only on the PAM
   system.  When external, the user or group is defined in an External
   Store, and is somehow synchronized into the PAM system.  In this
   case, the PAM system keeps a record of the external user or group,
   along with a reference that can be used to correlate the record back
   to the external store.  To support this, an optional schema extension
   "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:pam:1.0:LinkedObject" MAY be added to
   the User and Group resource types.

2.1.  Linked Object

   The "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:pam:1.0:LinkedObject" schema
   contains the following attributes.

Internet-Draft        draft-grizzle-scim-pam-ext-00       September 2017


   source  The name of the External Source from which the User or Group
      came.  If this is a local User or Group, this is null.  Required
      if nativeIdentifier is non-null.

   nativeIdentifier  The unique identifier of the User or Group on the
      External Source (e.g. - an LDAP distinguished name).  If this is a
      local User or Group, this is null.  Required if source is non-
      null.

2.1.1.  Example

   The following is a non-normative example of a User with the
   LinkedObject extension.

  }
}


2.1.2.  Considerations for External Groups

   Members of external groups are stored and managed on the External
   Store, and not in the PAM system.  As a result, the User and Group
   representations returned by the PAM system MAY return empty values
   for the "groups" and "members" attributes, respectively.
   Additionally, the PAM system MAY choose to return an error response
   with the 400 status code and "invalidSyntax" error type for requests
   that attempt to modify or create a group with an invalid
   configuration.  Examples include, but are not limited to:

   o  An external group with any members.

   o  An external group with local Users or Groups as members.

   o  A local group with external Users or Groups as members.

3.  Additional ResourceTypes and Schemas

   PAM systems define additional constructs to provide enhanced
   authorization, authentication, and management for privileged data.
   To support this, the SCIM PAM extension defines additional
   ResourceTypes and Schemas that MAY be implemented by the service
   provider.  If implemented, these ResourceTypes SHOULD support all
   SCIM operations [RFC7644].  All attributes defined in the schemas are
   optional unless explicitly marked as REQUIRED.

3.1.  Container

   A Container is a logical grouping of privileged data that can be used
   for organizational or operational purposes.

3.1.1.  Resource Type

   The Container ResourceType supports reading and managing containers,
   and has the following properties.

   Name:  Container

   Endpoint:  /Containers

   Schema:  urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:pam:1.0:Container

3.1.1.1.  Filtering

   Clients may have a reference to the Container name but not the ID.
   For this reason, it is RECOMMENDED that service providers implement
   filtering that allows equality matching on the "name" attribute.
   Example (note that escaping has been removed for readability):

   GET /scim/v2/Containers?filter=name eq 'Admin Accounts'

3.1.2.  Schema

   The "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:pam:1.0:Container" defines all
   common attributes for a Container.

   id The unique identifier of the Container.  REQUIRED

   name  The name of the Container.  REQUIRED

   displayName  The display name of the Container.  If null, the name
      should be used as the display name.

   description  The description of the Container.

   type  The type of container.  There are no canonical values defined
      for type, but service providers MAY choose to define the valid
      types.  Optional if the PAM system does not support multiple types
      of Containers.

   parent  A complex attribute that defines the parent Container of this
      Container if the service provider supports hierarchies of
      containers.  The following sub-attributes are defined.

Internet-Draft        draft-grizzle-scim-pam-ext-00       September 2017


      value  The ID of the Container that is the parent of this
         Container in the hierarchy.

      $ref  A URI reference to the Container that is the parent of this
         Container in the hierarchy.

      display  The display name of the Container that is the parent of
         this Container in the hierarchy.

   owner  A complex attribute that defines the User that is the owner of
      this Container.  The following sub-attributes are defined.

      value  The ID of the User that owns this Container.

      $ref  A URI reference to the User that owns this Container.

      display  The display name of the user that owns this Container.

   privilegedData  A multi-valued complex attribute that contains the
      PrivilegedData that resides in this Container.  Service providers
      MAY choose to make this attribute have a "returned" value of
      "request" if the list of privileged data could be very large.
      Using this option will prevent this attribute from being returned
      upon retrieval unless explicitly requested using the "attributes"
      query parameter.  The following sub-attributes are defined.

      value  The ID of the PrivilegedData.

      $ref  A URI reference to the PrivilegedData.

      display  The displayable value of the PrivilegedData.

      type  The type of the PrivilegedData.

3.1.3.  Example

   The following is a non-normative example of a Container.

3.2.  PrivilegedData

   Privileged data is secret information that is protected by the PAM
   system (e.g. - credentials for a privileged account, an SSH key,
   etc...).  Privileged data MAY be stored inside of a Container, but
   does not have to be.

3.2.1.  Resource Type

   The PrivilegedData ResourceType supports reading and managing
   privileged data, and has the following properties.

   Name:  PrivilegedData

   Endpoint:  /PrivilegedData

   Schema:  urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:pam:1.0:PrivilegedData

3.2.2.  Schema

   The "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:pam:1.0:PrivilegedData" defines all
   common attributes for a PrivilegedData.

   id The unique identifier of the PrivilegedData.  REQUIRED

   name  A descriptive name for this piece of PrivilegedData.  For
      example, root@mylinuxhost.  REQUIRED

   description  A description for this piece of PrivilegedData.

   type  The type of PrivilegedData.  The value will be dependent on
      what is supported by the PAM system.  Examples include
      'credential', 'ssh key', 'file', etc...

3.2.3.  Example

   The following is a non-normative example of a PrivilegedData.

3.3.  ContainerPermission

   A ContainerPermission contains authorization information that
   describes which rights a User or Group has on a Container.  This is a
   piece of an Access Control List that contains all information about a
   specific User or Group in relation to a specific Container.
   Typically, permissions that are granted on a Container apply to all
   privileged data that resides in the container.

3.3.1.  Resource Type

   The ContainerPermission ResourceType supports reading and managing
   permissions that a User or Group have on a Container, and has the
   following properties.

   Name:  ContainerPermission

   Endpoint:  /ContainerPermissions

   Schema:  urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:pam:1.0:ContainerPermission

3.3.1.1.  Filtering

   It is expected that clients will need to find the permissions on a
   specific Container that are granted to a specific User or Group.  For
   this reason, it is RECOMMENDED that service providers implement
   filtering that allows equality matching on the "container.value",
   "user.value", and "group.value" attributes.  Example (note that
   escaping has been removed and newlines added for readability):

GET /scim/v2/ContainerPermissions?
        filter=container.value eq '8729e778-9af6-874c-778a3-783956810384' and
               user.value eq '2819c223-7f76-453a-919d-413861904646'

3.3.2.  Schema

   The "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:pam:1.0:ContainerPermission"
   defines all common attributes for a ContainerPermission.

   id The unique identifier of the ContainerPermission.  REQUIRED

   container  A complex attribute that references the Container that
      these permissions apply to.  The following sub-attributes are
      defined.  REQUIRED

      value  The ID of the Container that these permissions apply to.

      $ref  A URI reference to the Container that these permissions
         apply to.

      name  The name of the Container that these permissions apply to.

      display  The display name of the Container that these permissions
         apply to.

   user  A complex attribute that references the User that these
      permissions apply to.  Either this attribute or "group" is
      required.  The following sub-attributes are defined.

      value  The ID of the User that these permissions apply to.

      $ref  A URI reference to the User that these permissions apply to.

      display  The display name of the User that these permissions apply
         to.

   group  A complex attribute that references the Group that these
      permissions apply to.  Either this attribute or "user" is
      required.  The following sub-attributes are defined.

      value  The ID of the Group that these permissions apply to.

      $ref  A URI reference to the Group that these permissions apply
         to.

      display  The display name of the Group that these permissions
         apply to.

   rights  An array of strings that are the names of the rights that the
      User or Group has on this Container.  There are no canonical
      values defined for rights, and these will vary between service
      providers.

3.3.3.  Example

   The following is a non-normative example of a ContainerPermission.

3.4.  PrivilegedDataPermission

   A PrivilegedDataPermission contains authorization information that
   describes which rights a User or Group has on a PrivilegedData.  This
   is a piece of an Access Control List that contains all information
   about a specific User or Group in relation to a specific piece of
   privileged data.  This resource type and schema are OPTIONAL if the
   service provider does not support permissions on privileged data.

3.4.1.  Resource Type

   The PrivilegedDataPermission ResourceType supports reading and
   managing permissions that a User or Group have on a PrivilegedData,
   and has the following properties.

   Name:  PrivilegedDataPermission

   Endpoint:  /PrivilegedDataPermissions
