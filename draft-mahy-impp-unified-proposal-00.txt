Abstract

   Standardization of Instant Message and Presence Protocols in the IETF
   has resulted in multiple protocols. There are significant industry
   and technical advantages to standardizing a unified approach for
   server-to-server Instant Messaging and Presence.  This document
   proposes a server profile which uses SIP to exchange presence and
   setup sessions, and XMPP for message transport.

1. Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].

2. Problem Statement

   The authors of this document believe that a unified approach for
   server-to-server Instant Messaging and Presence offers significant
   technical and industry advantages. The IM and Presence industry is
   currently fragmented. Having two IETF protocols for IM and Presence
   with no additional guidance on the use of these protocols is
   confusing to the industry, and until the IETF  provides leadership
   and guidance in this area, it is unlikely that any significant
   percentage of Instant Messaging traffic will use interoperable
   systems. We believe that a profile which describes the use of SIP [4]
   and XMPP [2] for server-to-server interoperability provides the
   guidance the industry needs in a way which is mutually beneficial to
   both communities, and naturally uses the core strengths of each
   protocol. We refer to this combined system as UMPP (Unified Messaging
   and Presence Profile).

   A UMPP Server consists of a cooperating SIP Server and an XMPP Host,
   which provide basic server-to-server instant messaging and presence.
   While additional capabilities could be added in the future, the focus
   is on basic functionality to solve a very pressing interoperability
   problem. UMPP Servers talk to other UMPP Servers using SIP and XMPP,
   and to their clients using whatever protocol they would like. A UMPP
   Server can support communities of XMPP-only clients, SIMPLE-only
   clients, and/or clients using proprietary protocols for example.

Internet-Draft          Unified IM & P Proposal             January 2004


   A series of XMPP "chat" or "groupchat" messages (for example a
   thread) can be viewed as a session. UMPP SIP servers exchange offers
   and answers [6] for sessions of XMPP IM [3] messages. When one domain
   wishes to send an IM to another, it issues a standard SIP invitation
   to establish an IM session between them. The session descriptions in
   the appropriate SIP messages contain XMPP identifiers (JIDs) to
   identify where the messages are to be sent. These messages can be
   protected end-to-end using the XMPP e2e tag [12]

   This approach combines the best of what SIP and XMPP have to offer.
   SIP's session mode allows IM to work in exactly the same way as
   voice, video, and other communications modalities [14]. XMPP's
   lightweight transport and congestion control properties make it ideal
   for carrying the actual messages.

   Presence data in the IMPP Presence Information Data Format (PIDF [9])
   format is exchanged using subscriptions [7] to the SIP presence [8]
   event package. When a user in one domain wishes to obtain presence
   information from a user in another domain, the server in the
   originating domain issues a SIP SUBSCRIBE request. Presence data is
   then delivered in NOTIFY messages sent from the domain of the
   presentity.

   One of the complexities in providing a server to server protocol that
   works across different intra-domain IM technologies is naming. SIP
   uses the SIP URI for addressing, and XMPP uses the JID (XMPP
   Identifier). UMPP servers use im: [10] and pres: [11] URIs as
   universal identifiers for initial addressing (SIP addresses-of-record
   and bare XMPP JIDs are not used). SIP contact URIs are exchanged in
   Contact headers, and fully-qualified JIDs are exchanged in session
   descriptions and in XMPP messages.  UMPP servers can use the
   procedures defined in [13] or local resolution procedures to locate
   the appropriate server for im: and pres: URIs. This is similar to how
   addressing works in email systems, where the universal user@domain
   identifier is mapped to local identifiers used by mail systems in
   each domain.

4. Examples

   The examples in the following section omit portions of SIP messages
   and XMPP streams for brevity and clarity. Specifically SIP Via,
   Max-Forwards, and Content-Length headers are omitted; and initial
   XMPP stream setup with TLS and SASL is omitted.

4.1 Exchanging Instant Messages

   When a client represented by one UMPP Server (Romeo) wants to send
   messages to a client represented by another UMPP Server (Juliet),

Internet-Draft          Unified IM & P Proposal             January 2004


   Romeo's UMPP Server sends a SIP invitation to Juliet's UMPP Server.
   The servers exchange fully qualified JIDs (XMPP identifiers), and
   then send XMPP messages. When the session is over, either server
   sends a SIP BYE request.

4.2 Exchanging Presence Data

   When a client represented by one UMPP Server (Romeo) wants to
   subscribe to presence data of a client represented by another UMPP
   Server (Juliet), Romeo's UMPP Server sends a SIP subscription to the
   presence event package to Juliet's UMPP Server. Juliet's presence
   state arrives in notifications in the PIDF document format.

      example.net                         example.com
      UMPP Sever                          UMPP Server
      (Romeo)                                (Juliet)

5. Security Considerations

   This document introduces no additional security considerations as it
   is merely a usage of two existing standards track protocols.  UMPP
   SIP Servers MUST implement TLS and the SIPS URI scheme.  UMPP XMPP
   Hosts MUST implement STARTTLS and SASL EXTERNAL).  TLS
   implementations used with UMPP (both SIP and XMPP) SHOULD implement
   TLS mutual authentication.

6. Contributors

   The ideas behind this document were the result of a collaborative
   effort which initially involved Frank Cardello (Jabber), Jonathan
   Christiansen (FaceTime), Lisa Dusseault (Xythos), Joe Hildebrand
   (Jabber), Cullen Jennings (Cisco), Rohan Mahy (Cisco), Jon Peterson
   (Neustar), and Jonathan Rosenberg (dynamicsoft) during a face-to-face
   meeting in October 15, 2003 in San Jose, California.  While this
   group was unable to come to a consensus on the details of such a
   profile during numerous meetings before and during IETF 58 in
   Minneapolis, the editor feels that this concept was of significant
   interest to the community and therefore should be published to invoke
   wider discussion.

   The use of sessions of XMPP setup via SIP was first documented by Ben
   Campbell and Robert Sparks of dynamicsoft. This document borrows
   heavily from their efforts.
