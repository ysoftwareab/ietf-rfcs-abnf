Abstract

   Although Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA)
   contributes the population of the Internationalized Domains, it
   forces human DNS managers to handle unreadable DNS records.  In order
   to enable human managers to easily edit or modify DNS records, DNS
   servers should allow Unicode resource records.  This document defines
   the formats of DNS Resource Records and a translation process that
   supports Unicode Resource Records without ruining the
   interoperability with existing DNS infrastructure.

Internet-Draft          Unicode resource records            October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) [RFC3490] [1]
   has applications use an "ACE label" (ACE stands for ASCII Compatible
   Encoding) to represent an Internationalized Domain Names (IDN).  The
   main advantage of IDNA is that lower-layer protocols need not be
   aware of the existence of IDNA.  For the reason, IDNA is widely
   accepted where IDN is needed, especially Web browsers.  Though it
   does not require any changes of existing DNS actors including DNS
   servers, resolvers, and protocol elements, it demands the use of ACE
   label in DNS database.  Since an ACE label is difficult for human to
   read or infer, human managers cannot directly edit DNS database and
   cannot easily examine the validness of DNS records.

   In order to use a Unicode label instead of an ACE label in the DNS
   database, several technical factors should be considered.  First, the
   types of DNS Resource Records should be decided.  Some types are not
   adequate to hold Unicode [3] label due to the interoperability with
   other DNS standards.  Second, a translation process of DNS server
   that does not hurt the interoperability with IDNA should be
   considered.  By inserting a thin translation process between DNS
   database and DNS protocols, the support of Unicode Resource Records
   is possible while maintaining the interoperability.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

   Unicode [3] is a coded character set containing tens of thousands of
   characters.  A single Unicode code point is denoted by "U+" followed
   by four to six hexadecimal digits, while a range of Unicode code
   points is denoted by two hexadecimal numbers separated by "..", with
   no prefixes.

   A label is an individual part of a domain name.  Labels are usually
   shown separated by dots; for example, the domain name
   "www.example.com" is composed of three labels: "www", "example", and
   "com".  (The zero-length root label described in [STD13], which can
   be explicit as in "www.example.com." or implicit as in
   "www.example.com", is not considered a label in this specification.)
   IDNA extends the set of usable characters in labels that are text.
   For the rest of this document, the term "label" is shorthand for
   "text label", and "every label" means "every text label".

   An ACE label is an internationalized label that can be rendered in

   ASCII and is equivalent to an internationalized label that cannot be
   rendered in ASCII.


3.  Problem Statements

3.1.  Applicable types of DNS Resource Records

   A large number of Resource Records have been defined over the 25
   years of the DNS specification.  However, applicable types are
   restricted due to not all Resource Records can hold IDN data.  The
   applicable types can be grouped with the purpose of administrative
   and host information.

3.1.1.  Administrative Resource Records

   SOA, NS, and MX Resource Records are defined for the administrative
   purpose.  SOA Resource Record describes the global characteristics of
   the zone.  NS Resource Record defines name servers that are
   authoritative for the zone.  MX Resource Record defines the mail
   servers for the zone.  These Resource Records are in close connection
   with other standards and this document does not have any intention to
   update the existing standards so IDNA standard does.  Unless the
   related standards are revised to invite the use of IDNA, these
   Resource Records SHOULD NOT be the target of this standard.

3.1.2.  Host Information Resource Records

   A, CNAME, PTR, and AAAA Resource Records are defined for holding host
   information of the zone.  A and AAAA Resource Records are used to
   indicate IPv4 and IPv6 address for the target domain name
   respectively.  CNAME Resource Record is used to allows one host be
   defined as the alias name for another host.  PTR Resource Record
   stands for resolving IP address into host name.

3.2.  Translation Process

   An ACE-encoded Resource Record is necessary to support the
   interoperability of existing DNS standards, but human mangers suffer
   for handling it.  In order to resolve this issue, DNS Resource
   Records should be written with Unicode characters.  However, this
   approach will conflict existing DNS infrastructure.  To avoid this
   conflict, a DNS server should translate an ACE-encoded Resource
   Record in a DNS query packet into a Unicode Resource Record.
   Reversely, it should also translate a Unicode Resource Record into an
   ACE-encoded Resource Record in a DNS answer packet.  By adopting this
   translation process into a DNS server, human managers can freely use
   Unicode Resource Records while maintaining the interoperability with

   IDNA.


4.  DNS Resource Records

4.1.  A Resource Record

   In A Resource Record, the name field of host name MAY be written with
   Unicode character strings. 'hangang'{U+D55C U+AC15} represents Han
   River in Seoul, Korea.  Actually, {U+D55C U+AC15} will be replaced
   with the corresponding Korean characters in DNS Resource Record.  A
   sample record is as below.

      {U+D55C U+AC15} IN A 192.168.0.4

4.2.  AAAA Resource Record

   In AAAA Resource Record, the name field of host name MAY be written
   with Unicode character strings.  A sample record is as below.

      {U+D55C U+AC15} IN AAAA 2001:db8::1

4.3.  CNAME Resource Record

   In CNAME Resource Record, the name field and the canonical-name of
   the host name MAY be written with Unicode character strings.  A
   sample record is as below.  'Arisoo'{U+C544 U+B9AC U+C218} represents
   the ancient name of Han River.

      {U+C544 U+B9AC U+C218} IN CNAME {U+D55C U+AC15}.example.com

4.4.  PTR Resource Record

   In PTR Resource Record, the right side of the PTR record can be
   written with Unicode character strings.

      4 IN PTR {U+D55C U+AC15}.example.com


5.  Translation Process

   When a Unicode-supporting DNS server receives a DNS query packet
   having an ACE-encoded Resource Record, the server extracts the
   Resource Record from the packet and translates it into the
   corresponding Unicode Resource Record.  The converted Unicode
   Resource Record is used to find the matching host information in the
   DNS database.  If the server finds the matching data, it makes a DNS
   answer packet containing an ACE-encoded Resource Record converted
