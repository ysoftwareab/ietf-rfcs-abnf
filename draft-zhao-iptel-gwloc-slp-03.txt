1. Introduction

   In the Internet telephony networks, an administrative domain has one
   or multiple location servers [1], and has numerous gateways that link
   the Internet to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). When a
   call arrives, a location server in the domain routes the call to one
   of these gateways. Figure 1 shows the typical scenario.

                                | incoming call

        Figure 1. Gateway Selection for Internet Telephony

   The gateway selection at the location server depends on many factors,
   including gateway availability, capacity, and cost for terminating a
   particular call. Obtaining the up-to-date gateway information is
   critical for a location server to route phone calls properly.

   This document describes how to use the Service Location Protocol (SLP
   [2]) for the gateway and location server interaction. It defines the
   "service:iptel-gw" template for the Internet telephony gateway
   service, and discusses the different usage scenarios and the
   applicability of SLP for the Internet telephony gateway location.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

2. SLP Overview

   SLP provides a scalable framework for service discovery and selection
   within one administrative domain. A service is described using a set
   of attributes, which is defined in the service template [4].

   An SLP system has three different entities: User Agent (UA), Service



Zhao, Schulzrinne          Expires: August 20, 2002             [Page 2]

Internet Draft          Gateway Location via SLP       February 20, 2002


   Agent (SA), and Directory Agent (DA). Normally, applications are
   bound to UAs and services to SAs. DAs may be deployed to cache
   service registrations from SAs to enhance the system scalability.
   Without DAs, a UA needs to query all SAs via multicast. If DAs are
   deployed, SAs register with DAs, and UAs query DAs, both via unicast.

   SLP uses both push and pull to disseminate service information. SAs
   can push service registrations to DAs via unicast, or perform
   notification to all UAs via multicast [5]. UAs can pull service
   information from all SAs via multicast, or from a DA via unicast.

3. Using SLP for Internet Telephony Gateway Location

   As a key constraint of Internet telephony is to minimize the call
   setup delay, a location server SHOULD reduce the time of gateway
   selection as much as possible. It is desirable that a location server
   has required gateway information before a call arrives. Otherwise, it
   will incur a longer call setup delay if a location server pulls
   gateway information after a call has arrived. Thus, the interaction
   of gateways and location servers shall use a push model: gateways
   push their information to location servers.

   To push gateway information to location servers, the mechanism
   described in RFC 3082 [5] can be used if multicast is supported. When
   multicast is not available or cannot be used for some reasons, the
   mechanism described in the next section can be used.

4. Pushing Gateway Information via Unicast

   To push gateway information to location servers via unicast, each
   location server needs to use a dedicated SLP DA. Figure 2 shows the
   architecture. The dedicated DA SHOULD only operate in a special
   scope. The default value for the special scope is "iptel-gw", but it
   could be set to some other value administratively.

   Note that binding applications to DAs is not the common usage model
   for SLP DAs. This usage is motivated by performance and timeliness
   requirements of Internet telephony, where a location server needs to
   frequently consult the gateway information to make routing decisions,
   and the lookup time must be short.

   When multiple location servers are deployed in a domain, a gateway
   may need to push its information to several location servers. By
   using the SLP mesh-enhancement [6], a gateway only needs to push its
   information to one location server, then the information will be
   propagated automatically to other location servers. In general, a
   location server may use multiple gateways, and a gateway may serve
   multiple location servers.

     Figure 2. Push Gateway Information to Location Servers via Unicast

4.1. Gateway Operations

   A gateway uses an SLP SA to advertise its service. It registers its
   information with location servers using the "service:iptel-gw"
   template, refreshes its registration periodically, updates its
   registration whenever it is needed, and de-registers its information
   when its service is no longer available. A gateway discovers location
   servers using standard SLP DA discovery mechanism, including static
   configuration, DHCP [7], and multicast if it is available.

4.2. Location Server Operations

   A location server uses an SLP DA as its front end to accept and store
   gateway registrations. When a call arrives, the location server looks
   up the gateway information, and route the call to a gateway properly.

   Normally a location server and its front end DA are in the same
   machine. The location server uses an SLP UA to issue SLP requests via
   LOOPBACK to the local DA (Figure 3). This polling has a lower cost
   compared with a non-local UA-DA query. Note that when a location
   server queries its front end DA, it SHOULD use the Attribute List
   Extension (RFC 3059 [8]) to obtain the attribute information of
   gateways.

5. Template for Internet Telephony Gateway Service

   The "service:iptel-gw" template defines the attributes associated
   with the Internet telephony gateway service. Please refer to RFC 2609
   [4] for detailed explanation of the syntax.

   Security Considerations:
      When using multicast in SLP, useful information may be exposed
      to attachers. The standard SLP authentication mechanism SHOULD
      be used for accepting service registrations and validating DA
      advertisements.

6. Discussion

   In this section, we show that SLP can meet the requirements of the
   Internet telephony gateway discovery [9].

   (1) Fast: Using SLP, gateways send their registrations to location
   servers in advance. During a call setup, a location server only
   queries its local SLP DA to find the proper gateway.

Internet Draft          Gateway Location via SLP       February 20, 2002


   (2) Failure Detection: Using SLP, gateway availability can be decided
   in two ways. First, as each registration is a soft state, an expired
   registration will be removed, which indicates the corresponding
   gateway is not available. Second, a gateway can de-register its
   service information with location servers.

   (3) Startup Detection: Using SLP, a recovered gateway can send a new
   registration to location servers to notify its availability.

   (4) Capacity Knowledge: Using SLP, the capacity information is
   carried in the gateway registration, as specified in the
   "service:iptel-gw" service template.

   (5) Secure: SLP has authentication mechanism.

   (6) Routing Information: Using SLP, the routing information is
   carried in the gateway registration, as specified via the "prefix-
   info-list" attribute in the "service:iptel-gw" service template.

   (7) Timeliness: Using SLP, a gateway can update its service
   registration whenever it is needed. A wide range of updating interval
   is supported in SLP, from a few seconds to several hours.

   (8) Extensible Attributes: Using SLP, new attributes for the
   "service:iptel-gw" service template can be defined and added later.

   (9) Efficient: Gateway registrations at location servers can be
   refreshed or updated in a wide range of interval: from a few seconds
   to several hours. Thus, registration traffic is modest, and is
   demand-driven in most cases. Also, all registrations are performed in
   unicast. Furthermore, each location server accesses the gateway
   information locally (on the same machine).

   (10) Routing Control: Using SLP, gateway information is collected by
   SLP DAs, each location server makes its own routing decision.

   (11) Independent Policies: If multiple location servers exist within
   one administrative domain, gateways register with all available
   location servers. Using SLP, location servers can adopt different
   policies, and make different routing decisions.

7. Security Considerations

   When using multicast in SLP, useful information may be exposed to
   attachers. The standard SLP authentication mechanism SHOULD be used
   for accepting service registrations and validating DA advertisements.
