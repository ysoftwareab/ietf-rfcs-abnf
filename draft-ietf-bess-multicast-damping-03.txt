                      Multicast VPN state damping
                  draft-ietf-bess-multicast-damping-03

Abstract

   This document describes procedures to damp multicast VPN routing
   state changes and control the effect of the churn due to the
   multicast dynamicity in customer site.  The procedures described in
   this document are applicable to BGP-based multicast VPN and help
   avoid uncontrolled control plane load increase in the core routing
   infrastructure.  New procedures are proposed inspired from BGP
   unicast route damping principles, but adapted to multicast.

1.  Introduction

   In a multicast VPN [RFC6513] deployed with BGP-based procedures
   [RFC6514], when receivers in VPN sites join and leave a given
   multicast group or channel through multicast membership control
   protocols (IGMP, MLD), multicast routing protocols accordingly adjust

   multicast routing states and P-multicast tree states, to forward or
   prune multicast traffic to these receivers.

   In VPN contexts, providing isolation between customers of a shared
   infrastructure is a core requirement resulting in stringent
   expectations with regards to risks of denial of service attacks.
   Hence, mechanisms need to be put in place to ensure that the load put
   on the BGP control plane, and on the P-tunnel setup control plane,
   remains under control regardless of the frequency at which multicast
   memberships changes are made by end hosts.  By nature multicast
   memberships change based on the behavior of multicast applications
   running on end hosts, hence the frequency of membership changes can
   legitimately be much higher than the typical churn of unicast routing
   states.  Section 16 of [RFC6514] specifically spells out the need for
   damping the activity of C-multicast and Leaf Auto-discovery routes.

   This document describes procedures, remotely inspired from existing
   BGP route damping, aimed at protecting these control planes while at
   the same time avoiding negative effects on the service provided,
   although at the expense of a minimal increase in average of bandwidth
   use in the network.

   The base principle is described in Section 3.  Existing mechanisms
   that could be relied upon are discussed in Section 4.  Section 5
   details the procedures introduced by these specifications.

   Section 6 provides specific details related to the damping of
   multicast VPNs P-tunnel state.

   Finally, Section 7 discusses operational considerations related to
   the proposed mechanism.

2.  Terminology

   This document reuses terminology from [RFC4601] and [RFC6514].

3.  Overview

   The procedures described in this document allow the network operator
   to configure multicast VPN PEs (Provider Edge routers) so that they
   can delay the propagation of multicast state prune messages between
   PEs, when faced with a rate of multicast state dynamicity exceeding a
   certain configurable threshold.  Assuming that the number of
   multicast states that can be created by a receiver is bounded,
   delaying the propagation of multicast state pruning results in
   setting up an upper bound to the average frequency at which the
   router will send state updates to an upstream router.

Internet-Draft                mVPN damping                  January 2016


   From the point of view of a downstream router, such as a CE (Customer
   Edge router), this approach has no impact: the multicast routing
   states changes that it solicits to its PE will be honored without any
   additional delay.  Indeed the propagation of joins is not impacted by
   the procedures specified here, and having the upstream router delay
   state prune propagation to its own upstream router does not affect
   what traffic is sent to the downstream router.  In particular, the
   amount of bandwidth used on the PE-CE link downstream to a PE
   applying this damping technique is not increased.

   This approach increases the average bandwidth utilization on a link
   upstream to a PE applying this technique, such as a PE-PE link:
   indeed, a given multicast flow will be forwarded for a longer time
   than if no damping was applied.  That said, it is expected that this
   technique will allow to meet the goals of protecting the multicast
   routing infrastructure control plane without a significant average
   increase of bandwidth; for instance, damping events happening at a
   frequency higher than one event per X second, can be done without
   increasing by more than X second the time during which a multicast
   flow is present on a link.

   To be practical, such a mechanism requires configurability.  In
   particular, means are required to control when damping is triggered,
   and to allow delaying the pruning of a multicast state for a time
   increasing with the churn of this multicast state.  This will let the
   operator control the tradeoff made between minimizing the dynamicity
   and reducing bandwidth consumption.

4.  Existing mechanisms

   This section describes mechanisms that could be considered to address
   the issue, but that end up appearing as not suitable or not efficient
   enough.

4.1.  Rate-limiting of multicast control traffic

   PIM-SM specifications [RFC4609] examine multicast security threats
   and among other things the risk described in Section 1.  A mechanism
   relying on rate-limiting PIM messages is proposed in section 5.3.3 of
   [RFC4609], but has the identified drawbacks of impacting the service
   delivered and having side-effects on legitimate users.

4.2.  Existing PIM, IGMP and MLD timers

   In the context of PIM multicast routing protocols [RFC4601], a
   mechanism exists that may offer a form of de-facto damping of
   multicast states, under some conditions.  Indeed, when active, the
   prune override mechanism consists in having a PIM upstream router



Morin, et al.             Expires July 8, 2016                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                mVPN damping                  January 2016


   introduce a delay ("prune override interval") before taking into
   account a PIM Prune message sent by a downstream neighbor.

   This mechanism has not been designed specifically for the purpose of
   damping multicast state, but as a means to allow PIM to operate on
   multi-access networks.  See [RFC4601] section 4.3.3.  However, when
   active, this mechanism will prevent a downstream router to produce
   multicast routing protocol messages that would cause, for a given
   multicast state, the upstream router to send to its own upstream
   router, multicast routing protocol messages at a rate higher than
   1/[prune override interval].  This provides de-facto a form of
   damping.

   Similarly, the IGMP and MLD multicast membership control protocols
   can provide a similar behavior, under the right conditions.

   These mechanisms are not considered suitable to meet the goals
   spelled out in Section 1, the main reasons being that:

   o  when enabled these mechanisms require additional bandwidth on the
      local link on which the effect of a prune is delayed (in our case
      the PE-CE link)

   o  when enabled these mechanisms require disabling explicit tracking,
      even though enabling this feature may otherwise be desired

   o  on certain implementations, these mechanisms are incompatible with
      behaviors that cannot be turned off (e.g. implementation applying
      a fast-leave behavior on interfaces with only two neighbors)

   o  they do not provide a suitable level of configurability

   o  they do not provide a way to discriminate between multicast flows
      based on estimation of their dynamicity

4.3.  BGP Route Damping

   The procedures defined in [RFC2439] and [RFC7196] for BGP route flap
   damping are useful for operators who want to control the impact of
   unicast route churn on the routing infrastructure, and offer a
   standardized set of parameters to control damping.

   These procedures are not directly relevant in a multicast context,
   for the following reasons:

   o  they are not specified for multicast routing protocol in general





Morin, et al.             Expires July 8, 2016                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                mVPN damping                  January 2016


   o  even in contexts where BGP routes are used to carry multicast
      routing states (e.g.  [RFC6514]), these procedures do not allow to
      implement the principle described in this document, the main
      reason being that a damped route becomes suppressed, while the
      target behavior would be to keep advertising when damping is
      triggered on a multicast route

   However, the set of parameters standardized to control the thresholds
   of the exponential decay mechanism can be relevantly reused.  This is
   the approach proposed for the procedures described in this document
   (Section 5).  Motivations for doing so is to help the network
   operator deploy this feature based on consistent configuration
   parameter, and obtain predictable results, without the drawbacks of
   relying on rate-limiting of multicast control protocol exchanges (as
   exposed in Section 4.1) or on the use of existing PIM/IGMP timers (as
   exposed in Section 4.2).

5.  Procedures for multicast state damping

5.1.  PIM procedures

   This section describes procedures for multicast state damping
   satisfying the goals spelled out in Section 1.  This section spells
   out procedures for (S,G) states in the PIM-SM protocol [RFC4601] ;
   they apply unchanged for such states created based on multicast group
   management protocols (IGMP [RFC3376], MLD [RFC3810]) on downstream
   interfaces.  The same procedures are applied to (*,G) states in the
   context of PIM-SM ASM groups (damping is not applied to (S,G,Rpt)
   Prune state).

   The following notions introduced in [RFC2439] are reused in these
   procedures:

   figure-of-merit:  a number reflecting the current estimation of past
      recent activity of an (S,G) multicast routing state, which evolves
      based on routing events related to this state and based an
      exponential decay algorithm ; the activation or inactivation of
      damping on the state is based on this number ; this number is
      associated to the upstream state machine for (S,G) and is
      initialized to a value of zero on state creation

   cutoff-threshold:  value of the *figure-of-merit* over which damping
      is applied (configurable parameter)

   reuse-threshold:  value of the *figure-of-merit* under which damping
      stops being applied (configurable parameter)





Morin, et al.             Expires July 8, 2016                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                mVPN damping                  January 2016


   decay-half-life:  period of time used to control how fast is the
      exponential decay of the *figure-of-merit* (configurable
      parameter)

   Additionally to these values, a configurable *increment-factor*
   parameter is introduced, that controls by how much the *figure-of-
   merit* is incremented on multicast state update events.

   Section 7.3 proposes default and maximum values for the configurable
   parameters.

   On reception of updated multicast membership or routing information
   on a downstream interface I for a given (S,G) state, that results in
   a change of the state of the PIM downstream state machine (see
   section 4.5.3 of [RFC4601]), a router implementing these procedures
   MUST:

   o  apply unchanged procedures for everything relating to what
      multicast traffic ends up being sent on downstream interfaces,
      including interface I

   o  increasing the *figure-of-merit* for the (S,G) by the *increment-
      factor* (updating the *figure-of-merit* based on the decay
      algorithm must be done prior to this increment)

   o  update the damping state for the (S,G) state: damping becomes
      active on the state if the recomputed *figure-of-merit* is
      strictly above the configured *cutoff-threshold*

      *  if damping remains inactive on (S,G) state, update the upstream
         state machine as usual (as per section 4.5.7 of [RFC4601])

      *  if damping becomes active for the (S,G) state:

         +  if the received message has caused the upstream state
            machine to transition to Joined state, update the upstream
            state machine for (S,G) (applying usual PIM procedures in
            section 4.5.7 of [RFC4601], including sending a PIM Join to
            the upstream neighbor)

         +  if the received message has caused the upstream state
            machine to transition to NotJoined state, do not update the
            upstream state machine for (S,G)

         +  then freeze the upstream state machine in Joined state, and
            setup a trigger to update it once damping later becomes
            inactive again.  The effect is that in the meantime, PIM




Morin, et al.             Expires July 8, 2016                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                mVPN damping                  January 2016


            Join messages will be sent as refreshes to the upstream
            neighbor, but no PIM Prune message will be sent.

      *  if damping was already active: do not update the upstream state
         machine for (S,G) (the upstream state machine was frozen after
         processing the previous message)

   Once the *figure-of-merit* for (S,G) damping state decays to a value
   strictly below the configured *reuse-threshold*, the upstream state
   machine for (S,G) is recomputed based on states of downstream state
   machines, eventually leading to a PIM Join or Prune message to be
   sent to the upstream neighbor.

   Same techniques as the ones described in [RFC2439] can be applied to
   determine when the *figure-of-merit* value is recomputed based on the
   exponential decay algorithm and the configured *decay-half-life*.

   Given the specificity of multicast applications, it is REQUIRED for
   the implementation to let the operator configure the *decay-half-
   life* in seconds, rather than in minutes.  When the recomputation is
   done periodically, the period should be low enough to not
   significantly delay the inactivation of damping on a multicast state
   beyond what the operator wanted to configure (i.e. for a *decay-half-
   life* of 10s, recomputing the *figure-of-merit* each minute would
   result in a multicast state to remained damped for a much longer time
   than what the parameters are supposed to command).

   PIM implementations typically follow [RFC4601] suggestion that
   "implementations will only maintain state when it is relevant to
   forwarding operations - for example, the 'NoInfo' state might be
   assumed from the lack of other state information, rather than being
   held explicitly" (Section 4.1 of [RFC4601]).  To properly implement
   damping procedures, an implementation MUST keep an explicit (S,G)
   state as long as damping is active on an (S,G).  Once an (S,G) state
   expires, and damping becomes inactive on this state, its associated
   *figure-of-merit* and damping state are removed as well.

   Note that these procedures:

   o  do not impact PIM procedures related to refreshes or expiration of
      multicast routing states: PIM Prune messages triggered by the
      expiration of the (S,G) keep-alive timer, are not suppressed or
      delayed, and the reception of Join messages not causing transition
      of state on the downstream interface does not lead to incrementing
      the *figure-of-merit*;

   o  do not impact the PIM assert mechanism, in particular PIM Prune
      messages triggered by a change of the PIM assert winner on the
      upstream interface, are not suppressed or delayed;

   o  do not impact PIM Prune messages that are sent when the RPF
      neighbor is updated for a given multicast flow;

   o  do not impact PIM Prune messages that are sent in the context of
      switching between a Rendez-vous Point Tree and a Shortest Path
      Tree.

   Note also that no action is triggered based on the reception of PIM
   Prune messages (or corresponding IGMP/MLD messages) that relate to
   non-existing (S,G) state, in particular, no *figure-of-merit* or
   damping state is created in this case.

5.2.  Procedures for multicast VPN state damping

   The procedures described in Section 5.1 can be applied in the VRF
   PIM-SM implementation (in the "C-PIM instance"), with the
   corresponding action to suppressing the emission of a Prune(S,G)
   message being to not withdraw the C-multicast Source Tree Join
   (C-S,C-G) BGP route.  Implementation of [RFC6513] relying on the use
   of PIM to carry C-multicast routing information MUST support this
   technique.

   In the context of [RFC6514] where BGP is used to distribute
   C-multicast routing information, the following procedure is proposed
   as an alternative to the procedures in Section 5.1 and consists in
   applying damping in the BGP implementation, based on existing BGP
   damping mechanism, applied to C-multicast Source Tree Join routes and
   Shared Tree Join routes (and as well to Leaf A-D routes - see
   Section 6), and modified to implement the behavior described in
   Section 3 along the following guidelines:

   o  not withdrawing (instead of not advertising) damped routes

   o  providing means to configure the *decay-half-life* in seconds if
      that option is not already available

   o  using parameters for the exponential decay that are specific to
      multicast, based on default values and multicast specific
      configuration

   While these procedures would typically be implemented on PE routers,
   in a context where BGP Route Reflectors (RRs) are used it can be
   considered useful to also be able to apply damping on RRs as well.
   Additionally, for mVPN Inter-AS deployments, it can be needed to



Morin, et al.             Expires July 8, 2016                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                mVPN damping                  January 2016


   protect one AS from the dynamicity of multicast VPN routing events
   from other ASes.

   The choice to implement damping based on BGP routes or the procedures
   described in Section 5, is up to the implementor, but at least one of
   the two MUST be implemented.  In the perspective of allowing damping
   to be done on RRs and ASBRs, implementing the BGP approach is
   RECOMMENDED.

   When not all routers in a deployment have the capability to drop
   traffic coming from the wrong PE (as spelled out in section 9.1.1 of
   [RFC6513]), then the withdrawal of a C-multicast route resulting from
   a change in the Upstream Multicast Hop or Upstream Multicast PE
   SHOULD NOT be damped.  An implementation of the specification in this
   document MUST whether, not damp these withdrawals by default, or
   alternatively provide a tuning knob to disable the damping of these
   withdrawals.  Additionally, in such a context, it is RECOMMENDED to
   not enable any multicast VPN route damping on RRs and ASBRs, since
   these equipments cannot distinguish these events.

   Note well that damping SHOULD NOT be applied to BGP routes of the
   following sub-types: "Intra-AS I-PMSI A-D Route", "Inter-AS I-PMSI
   A-D Route", "S-PMSI A-D Route", and "Source Active A-D Route".

6.  Procedures for P-tunnel state damping

6.1.  Damping mVPN P-tunnel change events

   When selective P-tunnels are used (see section 7 of [RFC6513]), the
   effect of updating the upstream state machine for a given (C-S,C-G)
   state on a PE connected to multicast receivers, is not only to
   generate activity to propagate C-multicast routing information to the
   source connected PE, but also to possibly trigger changes related to
   the P-tunnels carrying (C-S,C-G) traffic.  Protecting the provider
   network from an excessive amount of change in the state of P-tunnels
   is required, and this section details how this can be done.

   A PE implementing these procedures for mVPN MUST damp Leaf A-D
   routes, in the same manner as it would for C-multicast routes (see
   Section 5.2).

   A PE implementing these procedures for mVPN MUST damp the activity
   related to removing itself from a P-tunnel.  Possible ways to do so
   depend on the type of P-tunnel, and local implementation details are
   left up to the implementor.

   The following is proposed as example of how the above can be
   achieved.

   o  For P-tunnels implemented with the PIM protocol, this consists in
      applying multicast state damping techniques described in
      Section 5.1 to the P-PIM instance, at least for (S,G) states
      corresponding to P-tunnels.

   o  For P-tunnels implemented with the mLDP protocol, this consists in
      applying damping techniques completely similar to the one
      described in Section 5, but generalized to apply to mLDP states

   o  For root-initiated P-tunnels (P-tunnels implemented with the P2MP
      RSVP-TE, or relying on ingress replication), no particular action
      needs to be implemented to damp P-tunnels membership, if the
      activity of Leaf A-D route themselves is damped

   o  Another possibility is to base the decision to join or not join
      the P-tunnel to which a given (C-S,C-G) is bound, and to advertise
      or not advertise a Leaf A-D route related to (C-S,C-G), based on
      whether or not a C-multicast Source Tree Join route is being
      advertised for (C-S,C-G), rather than by relying on the state of
      the C-PIM Upstream state machine for (C-S,C-G)

6.2.  Procedures for Ethernet VPNs

   Specifications exist to support or optimize multicast and broadcast
   in the context of Ethernet VPNs [RFC7117], relying on the use of
   S-PMSI and P-tunnels.  For the same reasons as for IP multicast VPNs,
   an implementation of these procedures MUST follow the procedures
   described in Section 6.1.

7.  Operational considerations

7.1.  Enabling multicast damping

   In the context of multicast VPNs, these procedures would be enabled
   on PE routers.  Additionally in the case of C-multicast routing based
   on BGP extensions ([RFC6514]) these procedures can be enabled on
   ASBRs and Route Reflectors.

7.2.  Troubleshooting and monitoring

   Implementing the damping mechanisms described in this document should
   be complemented by appropriate tools to observe and troubleshoot
   damping activity.

   More specifically it is RECOMMENDED to complement the existing
   interface providing information on multicast states with information
   on eventual damping of corresponding states (e.g.  MRIB states):
   C-multicast routing states and P-tunnel states.

7.3.  Default and maximum values

   The following values are RECOMMENDED to adopt as default conservative
   values:

   o  *increment-factor*: 1000

   o  *cutoff-threshold*: 3000

   o  *decay-half-life*: 10s

   o  *reuse-threshold*: 1500

   For unicast damping, it is common to set an upper bound to the time
   during which a route is suppressed.  In the case of multicast state
   damping, which relies on not withdrawing a damped route, it may be
   desirable to avoid a situation where a multicast flow would keep
   flowing in a portion of the network for a very large time in the
   absence of receivers.

   The proposed default maximum value for the *figure-of-merit* is
   20x*increment-factor*, i.e. 20000 with the proposed default
   *increment-factor* of 1000.

   The following values are proposed as maxima:

   o  *decay-half-life*: 60s

   o  *cutoff-threshold*: 50000

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

9.  Security Considerations

   The procedures defined in this document do not introduce additional
   security issues not already present in the contexts addressed, and
   actually aim at addressing some of the identified risks without
   introducing as much denial of service risk as some of the mechanisms
   already defined.

   The protection provided relates to the control plane of the multicast
   routing protocols, including the components implementing the routing

   protocols and the components responsible for updating the multicast
   forwarding plane.

   The procedures describe are meant to provide some level of protection
   for the router on which they are enabled by reducing the amount of
   routing state updates that it needs to send to its upstream neighbor
   or peers, but do not provide any reduction of the control plane load
   related to processing routing information from downstream neighbors.
   Protecting routers from an increase in control plane load due to
   activity on downstream interfaces toward core routers (or in the
   context of BGP-based mVPN C-multicast routing, BGP peers) shall rely
   upon the activation of damping on corresponding downstream neighbors
   (or BGP peers) and/or at the edge of the network.  Protecting routers
   from an increase in control plane load due to activity on customer-
   facing downstream interfaces or downstream interfaces to routers in
   another administrative domain, is out of the scope of this document
   and should rely upon already defined mechanisms (see [RFC4609]).

   To be effective the procedures described here must be complemented by
   configuration limiting the number of multicast states that can be
   created on a multicast router through protocol interactions with
   multicast receivers, neighbor routers in adjacent ASes, or in
   multicast VPN contexts with multicast CEs.  Note well that the two
   mechanism may interact: state for which Prune has been requested may
   still remain taken into account for some time if damping has been
   triggered and hence result in otherwise acceptable new state from
   being successfully created.

   Additionally, it is worth noting that these procedures are not meant
   to protect against peaks of control plane load, but only address
   averaged load.  For instance, assuming a set of multicast states
   submitted to the same Join/Prune events, damping can prevent more
   than a certain number of Join/Prune messages to be sent upstream in
   the period of time that elapses between the reception of Join/Prune
   messages triggering the activation of damping on these states and
   when damping becomes inactive after decay.
