1.  Introduction

   This specification defines algorithm encodings and representations
   enabling the ISO/IEC 14888-3:2018 elliptic curve "SM2" [ISO14888-3]
   to be used for JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) [RFC7515]
   and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [RFC8152] messages.
   The elliptic curve and associated algorithm are registered in
   appropriate IANA JOSE and COSE registries.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  JOSE and COSE SM2 Curve Key Representations

   The ISO/IEC 14888-3:2018 elliptic curve "SM2" [ISO14888-3] is
   represented in a JSON Web Key (JWK) [RFC7517] using these values:

   *  kty: EC
   *  crv: SM2

   plus x and y values to represent the curve point for the key.  Other
   optional values such as alg MAY also be present.

   It is represented in a COSE_Key [RFC8152] using these values:

Internet-Draft        Using SM2 with JOSE and COSE         November 2021


   *  kty (1): EC2 (2)
   *  crv (-1): SM2 (TBD - requested assignment 9)

   plus x (-2) and y (-3) values to represent the curve point for the
   key.  Other optional values such as alg (3) MAY also be present.

3.  ECDSA Signature with SM2 Curve

   The ECDSA signature algorithm is defined in [ISO14888-3].
   Implementations need to check that the key type is EC for JOSE or EC2
   (2) for COSE when creating or verifying a signature.

   The ECDSA algorithm specified in this document is:

     +===============+================================+=============+
     | JOSE Alg Name | COSE Alg Value                 | Description |
     +===============+================================+=============+
     | SM2           | TBD (requested assignment -48) | ECDSA w/    |
     |               |                                | SM2 Curve   |
     +---------------+--------------------------------+-------------+
