      VPN Prefix Outbound Route Filter (VPN Prefix ORF) for BGP-4
                    draft-wang-idr-vpn-prefix-orf-01

Abstract

   This draft defines a new Outbound Route Filter (ORF) type, called the
   VPN Prefix ORF.  The described VPN Prefix ORF mechanism is applicable
   when the VPN routes from different VRFs are exchanged via one shared
   BGP session(e.g. routers in a single-domain connect via Route
   Reflector).

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.wang-idr-vpn-routes-control-analysis] analysis the scenarios and
   necessaries for VPN routes control in the shared BGP session.  This
   draft analizes the existing solutions and their limitations for these
   scenarios, proposes the new VPN Prefix ORF solution to meet the
   requirements that described in section 8 of
   [I-D.wang-idr-vpn-routes-control-analysis].

   Now, there are several solutions can be used to alleviate these
   problem:

   o  Route Target Constraint (RTC) as defined in [RFC4684]

   o  Address Prefix ORF as defined in [RFC5292]

   o  PE-CE edge peer Maximum Prefix

   o  Configure the Maximum Prefix for each VRF on edge nodes

Internet-Draft                   RD-ORF                    February 2022


   However, there are limitations to existing solutions:

   1) Route Target Constraint

   RTC can only filter the VPN routes from the uninterested VRFs, if the
   "trashing routes" come from the interested VRF, filter on RTs will
   erase all prefixes from this VRF.

   2) Address Prefix ORF

   Using Address Prefix ORF to filter VPN routes need to pre-
   configuration, but it is impossible to know which prefix may cause
   overflow in advance.

   3) PE-CE edge peer Maximum Prefix

   This mechanism can only protect the edge between PE-CE, it can't be
   deployed within PE that peered via RR.  Depending solely on the edge
   protection is dangerous, because if only one of the edge points being
   comprised/error-configured/attacked, then all of PEs within domain
   are under risk.

   4) Configure the Maximum Prefix for each VRF on edge nodes

   When a VRF overflows, it stops the import of routes and log the extra
   VPN routes into its RIB.  However, PEs still need to parse the BGP
   updates.  These processes will cost CPU cycles and further burden the
   overflowing PE.

   This draft defines a new ORF-type, called the VPN Prefix ORF.  This
   mechanism is event-driven and does not need to be pre-configured.
   When a VRF of a router overflows, the router will find out the VPN
   prefix(RD, RT, source PE, etc.) of excessive VPN routes in this VRF,
   and send a VPN Prefix ORF to its BGP peer that carrys the relevant
   information.  If a BGP speaker receives a VPN Prefix ORF entry from
   its BGP peer, it will filter the VPN routes it tends to send
   according to the entry.

   VPN Prefix ORF is applicable when the VPN routes from different VRFs
   are exchanged via one shared BGP session.

3.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in this draft:

   o  RD: Route Distinguisher, defined in [RFC4364]

   o  ORF: Outbound Route Filter, defined in [RFC5291]

   o  AFI: Address Family Identifier, defined in [RFC4760]

   o  SAFI: Subsequent Address Family Identifier, defined in [RFC4760]

   o  EVPN: BGP/MPLS Ethernet VPN, defined in [RFC7432]

   o  RR: Router Reflector, provides a simple solution to the problem of
      IBGP full mesh connection in large-scale IBGP implementation.

   o  VRF: Virtual Routing Forwarding, a virtual routing table based on
      VPN instance.

4.  Operation process of VPN Prefix ORF mechanism on sender

   The operation of VPN Prefix ORF mechanism on each device is
   independent, each of them makes a local judgement to determine
   whether it needs to send VPN Prefix ORF to its peers.

   When the VPN Prefix ORF mechanism is triggered, the device must send
   an alarm information to network operators.

4.1.  Intra-domain Scenarios and Solutions

   For intra-AS VPN deployment, there are three scenarios:

   o  RD is allocated per VPN/per PE, each VRF only import one RT(see
      Section 4.1.1).

   o  RD is allocated per VPN/per PE.  Multiple RTs are associated with
      such VPN routes, and be imported into different VRFs in other
      devices(see Section 4.1.2).

   o  RD is allocated per VPN, each VRF imports one/multiple RTs(see
      Section 4.1.3).

   The following sections will describe solutions to the above scenarios
   in detail.

   In this scenario, RD is allocated per VPN or per PE, each VRF only
   import one RT.  We assume the network topology is shown in Figure 1.

                 Figure 1 Network Topology of Scenario-1

   When PE3 sends excessive VPN routes with RT1, while both PE1 and PE2
   import VPN routes with RT1, the process of excessive VPN routes will
   influence performance of VRFs on PEs.  PEs and RR should have some
   mechanisms to identify and control the advertisement of excessive VPN
   routes.

   On PE1, each VRF has a set threshold, we assume it is 80% of Maximum
   Prefix of VRF.  When the number of VPN1 VRF routing entries reaches
   the threshold, PE1 will start monitoring the RD carried by the
   received VPN routing entries.  Once the number of VPN routing entries
   exceed the prefix limit, PE1 will calculate the RD, RT and its source
   PE received the most times during this period, the result is
   RD31(RT1) from PE3, which is associated with RT1.  Then, PE1 will
   locally discards the VPN routes carry RD31(RT1) which come from PE3
   in VRF1.

   Due to there is no other VRFs on it to import the VPN routes with
   RT1.  After local processing, PE1 will generate a BGP ROUTE-REFRESH

   message contains a VPN Prefix ORF entry, and send to RR.  RR will
   withdraw and stop to advertise such excessive VPN routes to PE1.

   On PE2, both VRF1 and VRF2 import VPN routes with RT1.  If PE2
   triggers VPN Prefix ORF mechanism when VRF1 overflows, VRF2 cannot
   receive VPN routes with RT1 as well.  PE2 should not trigger the VPN
   Prefix ORF message to RR(RD31, RT1, source PE is PE3) until all the
   VRFs that import RT1 overflow.

4.1.2.  Scenario-2 and Solution (Unique RD, Multiple RTs)

   In this scenario, RD is allocated per VPN or per PE.  Multiple RTs
   are associated with such VPN routes, and be imported into different
   VRFs in other devices.  We assume the network topology is shown in
   Figure 2.

                Figure 2 Network Topology of Scenario-2

   When PE3 sends excessive VPN routes with RT1 and RT2, while both PE1
   and PE2 import VPN routes with RT1, and PE1 also imports VPN routes
   with RT2, the process of excessive VPN routes will influence
   performance of VRF on PEs.  PEs and RR should have some mechanisms to
   identify and control the advertisement of excessive VPN routes.

   In this senario, both VRF1 and VRF2 import VPN routes carry RT2,
   which is associated with RD31.

   On PE1, if its VRF1 overflows, it will know that the RD of excessive
   VPN routes is RD31(RT1) during the local processing, which come from
   PE3.  VRF1 and VRF2 on PE1 import the VPN routes respectively with
   RT1 and RT2.  Using RT and RD, the VPN Prefix ORF mechanism can
   filter VPN routes with RD31(RT1), without influence the VRF2.  When
   VPN Prefix ORF mechanisms is triggered, PE1 will discard the
   overflowed VPN routes locally and send VPN Prefix ORF entry to RR,
   and RR withdraws and stops to advertise such excessive VPN routes to
   PE1.

   On PE2, due to there is only one VRF imports VPN routes with RT1.  If
   it overflows, it will trigger VPN Prefix ORF(RD31, RT1, comes from
   PE3) mechanisms.  RR will withdraw and stop to advertise such
   excessive VPN routes to PE2.

4.1.3.  Scenario-3 and Solution (Universal RD)

   In this scenario, RD is allocated per VPN.  One/Multiple RTs are
   associated with such VPN routes, and be imported into different VRFs
   in other devices.  We assume the network topology is shown in
   Figure 3.

   When PE3 sends excessive VPN routes with RD1 and attached RT1 and
   RT2, while both PE1 and PE2 import VPN routes with RT1, the process

   of excessive VPN routes will influence performance of VRF on PEs.
   PEs and RR should have some mechanisms to identify and control the
   advertisement of excessive VPN routes.

   When PE2 overflows and PE1 not.  PE2 triggers the VPN Prefix ORF
   message(RD1, RT1, comes from PE3).  Using Source PE and RD, RR will
   only withdraw and stop to advertise VPN routes(RD1, RT1) come from
   PE3 to PE2.  The communication between PE2 and PE1 for VPN1 will not
   be influenced.

5.  Operation process of VPN Prefix ORF mechanism on receiver

   The receiver of VPN Prefix ORF entries may be a RR or PE.  As it
   receives the VPN Prefix ORF entries, it will checks <AFI/SAFI, ORF-
   Type, Sequence, Route Distinguisher> to find if it already existed in
   its ORF-Policy table.  If not, the receiver will add the VPN Prefix
   ORF entries into its ORF-Policy table; otherwise, the receiver will
   discard it.  Before the receiver send a VPN route, it will check its
   ORF-Policy table whether there is a related VPN Prefix ORF entry or
   not.  If not, the receiver will send this VPN route; otherwise, the
   receiver will stop sending that VPN route to its peer.

6.  Withdraw of VPN Prefix ORF entries

   When the VPN Prefix ORF mechanism is triggered, the alarm information
   will be generated and sent to the network operators.  Operators
   should manually configure the network to resume normal operation.
   Due to devices can record the VPN Prefix ORF entries sent by each
   VRF, operators can find the entries needs to be withdrawn, and
   trigger the withdraw process as described in [RFC5291] manually.
   After returning to normal, the device sends withdraw ORF entries to
   its peers who have previously received ORF entries.

7.  VPN Prefix ORF Encoding

   In this section, we defined a new ORF type called VPN Prefix Outbound
   Route Filter (VPN Prefix ORF).  The ORF entries are carried in the
   BGP ROUTE-REFRESH message as defined in [RFC5291].  A BGP ROUTE-
   REFRESH message can carry one or more ORF entries.  The ROUTE-REFRESH
   message which carries ORF entries contains the following fields:

   o  AFI (2 octets)

   o  SAFI (1 octet)

   o  When-to-refresh (1 octet): the value is IMMEDIATE or DEFER

   o  ORF Type (1 octet)



Wang, et al.             Expires August 11, 2022                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                   RD-ORF                    February 2022


   o  Length of ORF entries (2 octets)

   A VPN Prefix ORF entry contains a common part and type-specific part.
   The common part is encoded as follows:

   o  Action (2 bits): the value is ADD, REMOVE or REMOVE-ALL

   o  Match (1 bit): the value is PERMIT or DENY

   o  Reserved (5 bits)

   VPN Prefix ORF also contains type-specific part.  The encoding of the
   type-specific part is shown in Figure 4.

             +-----------------------------------------+
             |                                         |
             |          Sequence (4 octets)            |
             |                                         |

             |                                         |
             +-----------------------------------------+
             |                                         |
             |        Optional TLVs (variable)         |
             |                                         |

               Figure 4: VPN Prefix ORF type-specific encoding

   o  Sequence: identifying the order in which VPN Prefix ORF is
      generated

   o  Route Distinguisher: distinguish the different user routes.  The
      VPN Prefix ORF filters the VPN routes it tends to send based on
      Route Distinguisher.

   o  Optional TLVs: carry the potential additional information to give
      the extensibility of the VPN Prefix ORF mechanism.

   Note that if the Action component of an ORF entry specifies REMOVE-
   ALL, the ORF entry does not include the type-specific part.  The
   Sequence can uniquely identifies a VPN Prefix ORF entry.  All VRFs
   share the sequence field, and the corresponding sequence of VPN
   Prefix ORF sent by each VRF will be recorded on the device.

   When the BGP ROUTE-REFRESH message carries VPN Prefix ORF entries, it
   must be set as follows:



Wang, et al.             Expires August 11, 2022                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                   RD-ORF                    February 2022


   o  The ORF-Type MUST be set to VPN Prefix ORF.

   o  The AFI MUST be set to IPv4, IPv6, or Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN).

   o  If the AFI is set to IPv4 or IPv6, the SAFI MUST be set to MPLS-
      labeled VPN address.

   o  If the AFI is set to L2VPN, the SAFI MUST be set to BGP EVPN.

   o  The Match field MUST be equal to DENY.

7.1.  Source PE TLV

   Source PE TLV is defined to identify the source of the VPN routes.
   Using source PE and RD to filter VPN routes together can achieve more
   refined route control.  The source PE TLV contains the following
   types:

   o  In single-domain or Option C cross-domain scenario, NEXT_HOP
      attribute is fixed during routing transmission, so it can be used
      as source address.

         Type = 1, Length = 4 octets, value = NEXT_HOP.

         Type = 2, Length = 16 octets, value = NEXT_HOP.

   o  In Option B or Option AB cross-domain scenario, NEXT_HOP attribute
      may be changed by ASBRs and cannot be used as the source address.
      The originator can be traced by the Route Origin Community in BGP
      (as defined in Section 5 of [RFC4360]).

         Type = 3, Length = 6 octets, value = the value field of Route
         Origin Community.

7.2.  Route Target TLV

   Route Target TLV is defined to identify the RT of the excessive VPN
   routes.  Using RT and RD to filter VPN routes together can be used
   when the source VRF contains multiple RTs, and the VPN routes with
   different RTs may be assigned to different VRFs on the receiver.  The
   encoding of Route Target TLV is following:

      Type = 4, Length = 8*n(n is the number of RTs that the excessive
      VPN routes attached) octets, value = the RT of the excessive VPN
      routes.  If multiple RTs are included, it must be an exact match.

8.  Security Considerations

   A BGP speaker will maintain the VPN Prefix ORF entries in an ORF-
   Policy table, this behavior consumes its memory and compute
   resources.  To avoid the excessive consumption of resources,
   [RFC5291] specifies that a BGP speaker can only accept ORF entries
   transmitted by its interested peers.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new Outbound Route Filter type - VPN Prefix
   Outbound Route Filter (VPN Prefix ORF).  The code point is from the
   "BGP Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) Types".  It is recommended to set
   the code point of VPN Prefix ORF to 66.

   This document also define a VPN Prefix ORF TLV type under "Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters", three TLV types are defined:

    +===========================+======+===========================+
    | Registry                  | Type |       Meaning             |
    +===========================+======+===========================+
    |IPv4 Source PE TLV         | 1    |IPv4 address for source PE.|
    +---------------------------+------+---------------------------+
    |IPv6 Source PE TLV         | 2    |IPv6 address for source PE.|
    +---------------------------+------+---------------------------+
    |ROC Source PE TLV          |      |Route Origin Community for |
    |                           | 3    |Source PE.                 |
    +---------------------------+------+---------------------------+
    |Route Target TLV           | 4    |Identify the RT of the     |
    |                           |      |excessive VPN routes       |
    +---------------------------+------+---------------------------+
