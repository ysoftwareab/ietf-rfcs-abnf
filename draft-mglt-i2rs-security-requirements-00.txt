1.  Introduction

   This document addresses security considerations for the I2RS
   architecture.  It provides guidance and security principles to
   guarantee the stability of the I2RS architecture.  This documents
   provides an analysis of the security issues of the I2RS architecture
   beyond those already listed in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture].

   Even though I2RS is mostly concerned by the interface between the
   I2RS Client and the I2RS Agent, the security recommendations must
   consider the entire I2RS architecture, specifying where security
   functions may be hosted, and what should be met so to address any new
   attack vectors exposed by deploying this architecture.  In other
   words, security has to be considered globally over the complete I2RS
   architecture and not only on the interfaces.

   I2RS architecture depicted in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] describes
   the I2RS components and their interactions to provide a programmatic
   interface for the routing system.  I2RS components as well as their
   interactions have not yet been considered in conventional routing

   systems.  As such it introduces a need to interface with the routing
   system designated as I2RS plane in this document.

   This document is built as follows.  Section 3 describes how the I2RS
   plane can be contained or isolated from existing management plane,
   control plane and forwarding plane.  The remaining sections of the
   document focuses on the security within the I2RS plane.  Section 4
   analyzes how the I2RS Authentication Authorization and Access Control
   (I2RS AAA) can be deployed throughout the I2RS plane in order to only
   grant access to the routing system resources to authorized components
   with the authorized privileges.  This also includes providing a
   robust communication system between the components.  Then, Section 5
   details how I2RS keeps applications isolated one from another and do
   not affect the I2RS components.  Applications may be independent,
   with different scopes, owned by different tenants.  In addition, they
   modify the routing system that may be in an automatic way.

   The reader is expected to be familiar with the
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture].

   [QUESTION: Some suggested to use system instead of plane.  Which is
   the more appropriate terminology?]

   - I2RS Agent AAA :

3.  I2RS Plane Isolation

   Isolating the I2RS plane from other network plane, such as the
   control plane, is foundational to I2RS security.  Clearly
   differentiating I2RS components from the rest of the network protects
   the I2RS components from vulnerabilities in other parts of the
   network, and protect other systems vital to the health of the network
   from vulnerabilities in the I2RS plane.  Separating the I2RS plane
   from other network control and forwarding planes is similar to the
   best common practice of containerizing software into modules, and
   defense in depth in the larger world of network security.

   Figure 1 (copied from [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture]) depicts the I2RS
   components that constitute the I2RS plane.  More specifically, the
   network oriented applications, the I2RS Client, the I2RS Agent, and
   to some extent the routing system resources accessed by the I2RS
   Agent.  The I2RS plane has its own goals and specificities that make
   it a separate plane from the others.  The I2RS plane purpose is to
   provide a standard programmatic interface of the routing system
   resources to network oriented applications.  Control plane and
   forwarding planes are related to routing protocols, and I2RS is based
   on top of those.  The management plane is usually vendor specific,
   provides a broader control over the networking equipment such as
   system service.  Given its associated privileges it is expected to be
   reserved to highly trusted users like network administrators.

   [QUESTION: Should we remove the text above and the figure? ]

   That said the I2RS plane cannot be considered as completely isolated
   from other planes, and interactions should be identified and
   controlled.  Follows a brief description on how the I2RS plane
   positions itself in regard to the other planes.  The description is
   indicative, and may not be exhaustive.

3.1.  I2RS plane and management plane

   The I2RS plane and the management plane both interact with several
   common elements on forwarding and packet processing devices.
   Figure 1 shows several of these interaction points, including the
   local configuration, the static system state, routing, and
   signalling.  Because of this potential overlaps, a routing resource
   may be accessed by different means (APIs, applications) and different
   planes.  To keep these overlaps under control.  On the other hand,
   one could either control the access to these resources with
   northbound APIs for example, and if conflicting overlaps cannot be
   avoided, then conflicts should be resolved in a deterministic way.
   On the norhtbound side, there must be clear protections against the
   I2RS system "infecting" the management system with bad information,
   or the management system "infecting" the I2RS system with bad
   information.  The primary protection in this space is going to need
   to be validation rules on the speed of information flow, value limits
   on the data presented, and other protections of this type.  On the
   conflicting side, there should be clear rules about which plan's
   commands win in the case of conflict in order to prevent attacks
   where the two systems can be forced to deadlock.

3.2.  I2RS plane and forwarding plane

   Applications using I2RS are part of the I2RS plane but may also
   interact with other components outside the I2RS plane.  A common
   example may be an application uses I2RS to configure the network
   according to security or monitored events.  As these events are
   monitored on the forwarding plane and not the I2RS plane, the
   application breaks plane isolation.

   In addition, applications may communicate with multiple I2RS clients;
   as such, any given application may have a broader view of the current
   and potential states of the network and the I2RS plane itself.
   Because of this, any individual application could be an effective
   attack vector against the operation of the network, the I2RS plane,
   or any plane with which the I2RS plane interacts.  There is little
   the I2RS plane can do to validate applications with which it
   interacts, other than to provide some broad general validations
   against common misconfigurations or errors.  As with the separation
   between the management plane and the I2RS plane, this should
   minimally take the form of limits on information accepted, limits on
   the rate at which information is accepted, and rudimentary checks
   against intentionally formed routing loops or injecting information
   that would cause the control plane to fail to converge.  Other forms
   of protection may be necessary.

3.3.  I2RS plane and Control plane

   The network control plane consists of the processes and protocols
   that discover topology, advertise reachability, and determine the
   shortest path between any location on the network and any
   destination.  It is not anticipated there will be any interaction
   between the on-the-wire signalling used by the control plane.
   However, in some situations the I2RS system could modify information
   in the local databases of the control plane.  This is not normally
   recommended, as it can bypass the normal loop free, loop free
   alternate, and convergence properties of the control plane.  However,
   if the I2RS system does directly inject information into these
   tables, the I2RS system should ensure that loop free routing is
   preserved, including loop free alternates, tunnelled interfaces,
   virtual overlays, and other such constructions.  Any information
   injected into the control plane directly could cause the control
   plane to fail to converge, resulting in a complete network outage.

3.4.  Recommendations

   To isolate I2RS transactions from other planes, it is recommended
   that:

Internet-Draft         I2RS Security Requirements              June 2015


   REQ 1:  Application-to-routing system resources communications should
           use an isolated network.  An isolated network may be provided
           with various level of isolation.  The highest level of
           isolation may be provided by using a physically isolated
           network.  Alternatives may also consider logical isolation;
           for example by using vLAN.  Eventually, in virtual
           environment that shares a common infrastructure, encryption
           may also be used as a way to enforce isolation.

   REQ 2:  The interface (like the IP address) used by the routing
           element to receive I2RS transactions should be a dedicated
           interface.

   REQ 3:  The I2RS Agent validates data to ensure injecting the
           information will not create a deadlock with any other system,
           nor will it create a routing loop, nor will it cause the
           control plane to fail to converge.

   When the I2RS Agent performs an action on a routing element, the
   action is performed via process(es) associated to a system user . In
   a typical UNIX system, the user is designated with a user id (uid)
   and belong to groups designated by group ids (gid).  These users are
   dependent of the routing element's operation system and are
   designated I2RS System Users.  Some implementation may use a I2RS
   System User for the I2RS Agent that proxies the different I2RS
   Client, other implementations may use I2RS System User for each
   different I2RS Clients.

   REQ 4:  I2RS Agent should have permissions separate from any other
           entity (for example any internal system management processes
           or CLI processes).

   I2RS resource may be shared with the management plane and the control
   plane.  It is hardly possible to prevent interactions between the
   planes.  I2RS routing system resource management is limited to the
   I2RS plane.  As such, update of I2RS routing system outside of the
   I2RS plane may be remain unnoticed unless explicitly notified to the
   I2RS plane.  Such notification is expected to trigger synchronization
   of the I2RS resource state within each I2RS component.  This
   guarantees that I2RS resource are maintained in a coherent state
   among the I2RS plane.  In addition, depending on the I2RS resource
   that is updated as well as the origin of the modification performed,
   the I2RS Authentication Authorization and Access Control policies
   (I2RS AAA) may be impacted.  More especially, a I2RS Client is more
   likely to update an I2RS resources that has been updated by itself,
   then by the management plane for example.

Internet-Draft         I2RS Security Requirements              June 2015


   REQ 5:  I2RS plane should be informed when a routing system resource
           is modified by a user outside the I2RS plane access.  This is
           designated as "I2RS resource modified out of I2RS plane".
           This requirements is also described in section 7.6 of
           [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] for the I2RS Client.  This
           document extends the requirement to the I2RS plane, in case
           future evolution of the I2RS plane.

   REQ 6:  I2RS plane should define an "I2RS plane overwrite policy".
           Such policy defines how an I2RS is able to update and
           overwrite a resource set by a user outside the I2RS plane.
           Such hierarchy has been described in section 6.3 and 7.8 of
           [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture]

   REQ 7:  I2RS AAA policies should be updated upon receipt of a "I2RS
           resource modified out of I2RS plane".

4.  I2RS Authentication and Authorization Access Policy for routing
    system resources

   This section details the I2RS Authentication and Authorization Access
   Policy (I2RS AAA) associated to the routing system resources.  These
   policies only apply within the I2RS plane for I2RS users.

4.1.  I2RS AAA architecture

   Applications access to routing system resource via numerous
   intermediaries nodes.  The application communicates with an I2RS
   Client.  In some cases, the I2RS Client is only associated to a
   single application, but the I2RS Client may also act as a broker.
   The I2RS Client, then, communicates with the I2RS Agent that may
   eventually access the resource.

   The I2RS Client broker approach provides scalability to the I2RS
   architecture as it avoids that each Application be registered to the
   I2RS Agent.  Similarly, the I2RS AAA should be able to scale numerous
   applications.

   REQ 8:  I2RS AAA should be performed through the whole I2RS plane.
           I2RS AAA should not be enforced by the I2RS Agent only within
           the routing element.  Instead, the I2RS Client should enforce
           the I2RS Client AAA against applications and the I2RS Agent
           should enforce the I2RS Agent AAA against the I2RS Client.
           Note that I2RS Client AAA is not in the scope of the I2RS
           architecture [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture], which exclusively
           focuses on the I2RS Agent AAA.

Internet-Draft         I2RS Security Requirements              June 2015


   This results in a layered and hierarchical I2RS AAA.  An application
   will be able to access a routing system resource only if both the
   I2RS Client is granted access by the I2RS Agent AAA and the
   application is granted access by the I2RS Client AAA.

   REQ 9:  In case I2RS Client AAA or I2RS Agent AAA does not grant the
           access to a routing system resource, the Application should
           be able to define the I2RS AAA that generated this reject, as
           well as the reason.  More specifically, the I2RS Agent may
           reject the request based on the I2RS Client privileges, and
           the I2RS Client should return a message to the application,
           indicating the I2RS Client does not have enough privileges.
           Similarly, if the I2RS Client does not grant the access to
           the application, the I2RS Client should also inform the
           application.  Note that although multiple reject may occur,
           only the first reject should be mandatory.

   In order to limit the number of access request that result in an
   error, each component should be able to retrieve the global I2RS AAA
   policies that applies to it.  This subset of rules is designated as
   the "I2RS AAA component's subset policies".  As they are subject to
   changes, a dynamic synchronization mechanism should be provided.

   REQ 10: The I2RS Client should be able to request for its I2RS AAA
           Agent subset policies to the I2RS Agent AAA, so to limit
           forwarding unnecessary queries to the I2RS Agent.

   REQ 11: The I2RS Client should be able to be notified when its I2RS
           AAA Agent subset policies have been updated.

   Similarly, for the application

   REQ 12: The Application may be able to request for its I2RS AAA
           Client subset policies, so to limit forwarding unnecessary
           queries to the I2RS Client.

   REQ 13: The Application may be able to subscribe a service that
           provides notification when its I2RS AAA Client subset
           policies have been updated.

   I2RS AAA should be appropriately be balanced between the I2RS Client
   and the I2RS Agent which can be illustrated by two extreme cases:

   - 1) I2RS Clients are dedicated to a single Application:   In this
         case, it is likely that I2RS AAA is enforced only by the I2RS
         Agent AAA, as the I2RS Client is likely to accept all access
         request of the application.  However, it is recommended that
         even in this case, I2RS Client AAA is not based on an "Allow

Internet-Draft         I2RS Security Requirements              June 2015


         anything from application" policy, but instead the I2RS Client
         specifies accesses that are enabled.  In addition, the I2RS
         Client may sync its associated I2RS Agent AAA with the I2RS
         Agent to limit the number of refused access requests being sent
         to the I2RS Agent.  The I2RS Client is expected to balance pro
         and cons between sync the I2RS Agent AAA and simply guessing
         the access request to the I2RS Agent.

   - 2) A single I2RS Client acts as a broker for all Applications:   In
         the case the I2RS Agent has a single I2RS Client.  Such
         architecture results in I2RS Client with high privileges, as it
         sums the privileges of all applications.  As end-to-end
         authentication is not provided between the Application and the
         I2RS Agent, if the I2RS Client becomes corrupted, it is
         possible for the malicious application escalates its privileges
         and make the I2RS Client perform some action on behalf of the
         application with more privileges.  This would not have been
         possible with end-to-end authentication.  In order to mitigate
         such attack, the I2RS Client that acts as a broker is expected
         to host application with an equivalent level of privileges.

   REQ 14: The I2RS AAA should explicitly specify accesses that are
           granted.  More specifically, anything not explicitly granted
           -- the default rule-- should be denied.

   In order to keep the I2RS AAA architecture as distributed as
   possible,

   REQ 15: I2RS Client should be distributed and act as brokers for
           applications that share roughly similar permissions.  This
           avoids ending with over privileges I2RS Client compared to
           hosted applications and thus discourages applications to
           perform privilege escalation within an I2RS Client.

   REQ 16: I2RS Agent should be avoided being granted over privileged
           regarding to their authorized I2RS Client.  I2RS Agent should
           be shared by I2RS Client with roughly similar permissions.

4.2.  I2RS Agent AAA

   The I2RS Agent AAA restricts the routing system resource access to
   authorized components.  Possible access policies may be none, read or
   write.  The component represents the one originating the access
   request.  The origin of the query is always an application.  However,
   the I2RS Agent may not be able to authenticate the application.
   Instead, the I2RS Client may act as a broker.  Similarly, multiple
   I2RS Agents may be used, and different access privilege may be
   provided depending on the I2RS Agent used.  As a result, the origin

Internet-Draft         I2RS Security Requirements              June 2015


   of the query may be represented in multiple ways, and each way be may
   associated to a specific AAA.

   REQ 17: I2RS Agent AAA may use various ways to represent the origin
           of the access request of a routing system resource.  However,
           representation of the origin should be based on information
           that can be authenticated.  The I2RS Client, optionally the
           I2RS Agent in case of multiple I2RS Agents go into this
           category.  On the hand, unless some additional means for
           authentication have been provided, the secondary identity
           used to tag the application as defined in
           [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] should not be considered.

   The I2RS Agent AAA may evolve over time as resource may also be
   updated outside the I2RS plane.  Similarly, a given resource may be
   accessed by multiple I2RS users within the I2RS plane.  Although this
   is considered as an error, depending on the I2RS Client that
   performed the update, the I2RS may accept or refuse to overwrite the
   routing system resource.

   REQ 18: Each routing system resource updated by a I2RS Agent should
           keep track of the component that performed the last update.

   REQ 19: the I2RS Agent should have a "I2RS Agent overwrite Policy"
           that indicates how the originating components can be
           prioritized.  This requirements is also described in section
           7.6 of [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture]

4.3.  I2RS Client AAA

   The I2RS Client AAA works similarly to the I2RS Agent AAA.  The main
   difference is that components are applications.  As a result,

   REQ 20: The I2RS Client should be able to authenticate its
           application.

   In case, no authentication mechanisms have being provided between the
   I2RS Client and the application, then I2RS Client may not act as
   broker, and be instead dedicated to a single application.  In this
   case, although this is not recommended, the I2RS AAA is only enforced
   by the I2RS Agent AAA.  The I2RS Client may only sync and cache the
   I2RS Agent AAA associated to its application, in order to limit the
   access requests to the I2RS Agent.  The I2RS Client is expected to
   balance pro and cons between synchronization of the I2RS Agent AAA,
   or simply sending the request to the I2RS Agent.

4.4.  I2RS AAA Security Domain

   I2RS Client AAA and I2RS Agent AAA are respectively enforced within
   the I2RS Client and the I2RS Agent.  I2RS AAA enforcement should not
   remain local, and should be also enforced through the network
   communications.  More specifically:

   - 1)  Communication should remain available at any time, and it
         should be robust to potential attacks, or misbehaviors.

   - 2)  Components' operation requests should be guaranteed to have
         have been properly authorized by the I2RS AAA policies.

4.4.1.  Available I2RS Communication Channel

   Communication is considered available if and only if all components
   are available as well as the communication channel itself.  In order
   to maintain it available here are the considered aspects:

   - 1)  Make communication robust to DoS by design

   - 2)  Provide active ways to mitigate an DoS attack

   - 3)  Limit damages when a DoS event occurs

   Protocols used to communicate between components should not provide
   means that would result in a component's resource exhaustion.

   At the transport layer, when possible, protocols that do not
   implement any mechanisms to check the origin reachability should be
   avoided (like UDP).  Instead, if possible, protocols like TCP or SCTP
   with origin reachability verification should be preferred.  Anti DoS
   mechanisms should also be considered at other layers including the
   application layer.  More specifically, it should be avoided to
   perform actions that generate heavy computation on a component.  At
   least the component should be able to post-pone and re-schedule the
   action.  Similarly, DoS by amplification should be avoided, and
   special attention should be given to small access request that
   generate massive network traffic without any control.  An example of
   asymmetric dialogue could be the subscription of information streams
   like prefix announcement from OSPF.  In addition, some service may
   also provide the ability to redirect these streams to a third party.
   In the case of information stream, registration by an I2RS Client may
   provide the possibility to redirect the stream on a shared directory,
   so it can be accessed by multiple I2RS Clients, while not flooding
   the network.  In this case, special attention should be provided so
   the shared directory can agree based on its available resources the




Migault & Halpern       Expires December 27, 2015              [Page 12]

Internet-Draft         I2RS Security Requirements              June 2015


   service subscription by the I2RS Client.  Otherwise, the shared
   directory may become overloaded.

   REQ 21: Communication protocols should be robust against DoS attacks.
           DoS should be considered at multiple layers, in the design of
           the communication protocol.  Engaged resources should be
           agreed by the component using these resources.

   Components should be able to control the computing resource they
   allocate to each other components, or each actions.  Based on
   available resource, requests should be differed, or returned an
   error.

   REQ 22: I2RS Client and I2RS Agent should implement mechanisms to
           mitigate DoS attacks.

   One alternative way to mitigate a DoS attack or event is to limit the
   damages when resource exhaustion happens.  This can be done by
   appropriately group or ungroup applications.  For example, critical
   applications may not share their I2RS Client with multiple other
   Applications.  This limits the probability of I2RS Client failure for
   the critical application.  Similarly, I2RS Agent may also be
   selective regarding their I2RS Client as well as to the scope of
   their routing system resources.  In fact some, some I2RS Client may
   be less trusted than others and some routing system resource access
   may be more sensitive than the others.  Note that trust of an I2RS
   Client is orthogonal to authentication and rather involves, for
   example, the quality of the hosted Applications.

   REQ 23: Application, I2RS Client and I2RS Agent should be distributed
           among the I2RS Plane to minimize the impact of a failure.

   Even though this should be considered, it does not address the high
   availability issue.  In order to reduce the impact of a single I2RS
   Client failure, remote applications may load balance their access
   request against multiple I2RS Clients.  Non remote I2RS Client or
   I2RS Agent are bound the system hosting the application or to the
   routing element.  This makes high availability be provided by the
   system, and thus implementation dependent.

   REQ 24: I2RS Client should provide resilient and high availability
           for the hosted applications.

4.4.2.  Trusted I2RS Communications Channel

   This section addresses the authorization and trust of the
   Communication Channel.  The main purpose of this section is to
   provide guidance to avoid identity usurpation.  More specifically,

Internet-Draft         I2RS Security Requirements              June 2015


   resource access request should only be issued and responded by the
   expected components and concern the expected resource only.

   REQ 25: Communications between the different components should be
           mutually authenticated.

   REQ 26: Communications between components should be protected against
           replay attacks.

   Within the I2RS AAA Security Domain, information exchanged between
   the I2RS Client and the I2RS Agent or the application and the I2RS
   Client may leak information about the application goal, as well as
   its internal logic.  As a result, it is recommended to isolate
   components communications.

   REQ 27: Communications between components should avoid leaking
           information about internal logic, and thus, it is recommended
           to encrypt them.

   When an incident occurs, one should be able to understand the reasons
   in order to prevent it to happen again.

   REQ 28: Log and monitoring facilities should be provided and made
           available for forensic investigation.

5.  I2RS Application Isolation

   A key aspect of the I2RS architecture is the network oriented
   application.  As these application are supposed to be independent,
   controlled by independent and various tenants.  In addition to
   independent logic, these applications may be malicious.  Then, these
   applications introduce also programmability which results in fast
   network settings.

   The I2RS architecture should remain robust to these applications and
   make sure an application does not impact the other applications.
   This section discusses both security aspects related to
   programmability as well as application isolation in the I2RS
   architecture.

5.1.  Robustness toward programmability

   I2RS provides a programmatic interface in and out of the Internet
   routing system.  This feature, in addition to the global network view
   provided by the centralized architecture comes with a few advantages
   in term of security.





Migault & Halpern       Expires December 27, 2015              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         I2RS Security Requirements              June 2015


   The use of automation reduces configuration errors.  In addition,
   this interface enables fast network reconfiguration.  Agility
   provides a key advantage in term of deployment as side effect
   configuration may be easily addressed.  Finally, it also provides
   facilities to monitor and mitigate an attack when the network is
   under attack.

   On the other hand programmability also comes with a few drawbacks.
   First, applications can belong to multiple tenants with different
   objectives.  This absence of coordination may result in unstable
   routing configurations such as oscillations between network
   configurations, and creation of loops for example.  A typical example
   would be an application monitoring a state and changing its state.
   If another application performs the reverse operation, the routing
   system may become unstable.  Data and application isolation is
   expected to prevent such situations to happen, however, to guarantee
   the network stability, constant monitoring and error detection are
   recommended to be activated.

   REQ 29: I2RS should monitor constantly parts of the system for which
           clients have requested notification.  It should also be able
           to detect components that lead the routing system in an
           unstable state.

5.2.  Application Isolation

5.2.1.  DoS

   Requirements for robustness to Dos Attacks have been addressed in the
   Communication channel section [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture].

   The I2RS interface is used by application to interact with the
   routing states.  As the I2RS Agent is shared between multiple
   applications, one application can prevent an application by
   performing DoS or DDoS attacks on the I2RS Agent or on the network.
   DoS attack targeting the I2RS Agent would consist in providing
   requests that keep the I2RS Agent busy for a long time.  This may
   involve heavy computation by the I2RS Agent for example to blocking
   operations like disk access.  In addition, DoS attacks targeting the
   network may use specific commands like monitoring stream over the
   network.  Then, DoS attack may be also targeting the application
   directly by performing reflection attacks.  Such an attack could be
   performed by indicating the target application as the target for some
   information like the listing of the RIB.  Reflection may be performed
   at various levels and can be based on the use of UDP or at the
   service level like redirection of information to a specific
   repository.

Internet-Draft         I2RS Security Requirements              June 2015


   REQ 30: In order to prevent DoS, it is recommended the I2RS Agent
           controls the resources allocated to each I2RS Clients.  I2RS
           Client that acts as broker may not be protected as
           efficiently against these attacks unless they perform
           resource controls themselves of their hosted applications.

   REQ 31: I2RS Agent does not make response redirection possible unless
           the redirection is previously validated and agreed by the
           destination.

   REQ 32: avoid the use of underlying protocols that are not robust to
           reflection attacks.

5.2.2.  Application Control

   Requirements for Application Control have been addressed in the I2RS
   plane isolation as well as in the trusted Communication Channel
   sections.

   Applications use the I2RS interface in order to update the routing
   system.  These updates may be driven by behavior on the forwarding
   plane or any external behaviors.  In this case, correlating
   observation to the I2RS traffic may enable to derive the application
   logic.  Once the application logic has been derived, a malicious
   application may generate traffic or any event in the network in order
   to activate the alternate application.

   REQ 33: Application logic should remain opaque to external listeners.
           Application logic may be partly hidden by encrypting the
           communication between the I2RS Client and the I2RS Agent.
           Additional ways to obfuscate the communications may involve
           sending random messages of various sizes.  Such strategies
           have to be balanced with network load.  Note that I2RS Client
           broker are more likely to hide the application logic compared
           to I2RS Client associated to a single application.
