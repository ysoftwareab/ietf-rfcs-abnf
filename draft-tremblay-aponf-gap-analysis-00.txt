      Application-based Policy for Network Functions Gap Analysis
                  draft-tremblay-aponf-gap-analysis-00

Abstract

   As operators struggle to optimize their network for different
   applications while maximizing network resources usage, there's
   growing business pressure to minimize operational tasks and the
   deployment time of new services.

   New automation paradigms are meant to help reach these goals,
   including the optimization of network functions through application
   control.  This control could be signaled directly by an application,
   through a proxy or orchestrated in a centralized manner.

   The current version of the Application-based Policy for Network
   Functions (APONF) proposed working group mentions the NSIS framework
   as a possible signaling protocol, through the definition of a new
   NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP).  The present memo analyses if
   this proposition is suitable for the designed purpose and if other
   protocols would be more suitable.

1.  Introduction

   Network operators, including Internet Service Providers, Datacenters
   operators and others, are under constant pressure to optimize the
   usage of their installed network resources while maintaining high
   availability and deploying new services at an ever-increasing pace.
   The capabilities of the deployment teams are often already stretched
   and scaling their efforts further while maintaining quality requires
   significant efforts.  The introduction of new paradigms aims at
   reducing these efforts, optimize network resource usage and minimize
   operational overhead.

   Two of these paradigms are the virtualization of some network
   functions (as discussed in the Service Function Chaining or SFC

   workgroup) and the automation in real time of network optimization
   based on application needs.  The latter may be realized by an
   application signaling directly some needs to network elements in the
   path using protocols such as RSVP or the NSIS framework.

   If the application does not support natively such protocols, the
   signaling function can be delegated to a proxy.  This delegation to a
   third party may incur some loss of functionality, as the proxy must
   rely on the examination of flows to trigger signaling or use an out-
   of-band mechanisms to exchange with the application.

   A third possibility for the deployment of automated network
   optimization is to use a centralized network management system.  Some
   functions such as access control and policy enforcement can be
   simplified as they are implemented from a centralized point.

   However, this technique requires previous knowledge and access to
   network elements by the network management system.  The usage of two
   protocols is likely to be required, as the protocol requirements for
   the application exchanging with the management system are different
   than those of the management system exchanging with network elements.
   The use of two independent protocols may be an opportunity to provide
   isolation from the network implementation through an abstraction
   layer, as discussed in the ACTN working group.

   Three signaling protocols may therefore be used for application-based
   network optimization:

   1.  A protocol for application signaling directly to network elements
       (such as RSVP) and report back the related states.

   2.  A protocol for applications to signal their needs to a central
       management system and get states from the network, possibly using
       an abstracted view optimized for the application.

   3.  A protocol for the signaling between the central management
       system and network elements, including the reporting of states.

   The present memo provides an analysis of the applicability of the
   NSIS framework and other protocols for the signaling cases described
   at point 2 and 3 above.  The NSIS framework could be used to provide
   these functions through the addition of a new NSIS Signaling Layer
   Protocol (NSLP).  Other protocols such as Netconf are also
   considered.

2.  Applicability to APONF Problem Statement

   Although the NSIS framework [RFC4080] defines both path-decoupled (or
   loosely coupled) and path-coupled modes of operation, subsequent work
   such as GIST [RFC5971] have been designed to work mainly with network
   elements located on the path taken by the data flow, as its
   predecessor RSVP.

   The NSIS framework is therefore well adapted to a scenario where an
   application would signal its needs to network elements directly in
   the data path (the first scenario described in the introduction).
   However, according to the APONF problem statement document
   [ID.karagiannis-aponf-problem-statement], the goal would be to have a
   protocol between a management application and network devices (the
   third scenario from the introduction).

   According to [ID.karagiannis-aponf-problem-statement], the second
   scenario where a protocol is used between an application and a
   central management would not be in scope either, because some level
   of abstraction would have to be presented by this protocol.  The
   generation of an abstract view of the network is described as out of
   scope in the problem statement.

   This document will therefore analyze the use of NSIS and other
   protocols such as netconf only for the signaling between a central or
   distributed management system/application and network elements (the
   third scenario in the instrocution).

3.  Gap Analysis for NSIS

3.1.  Scope

   NSIS has been designed to work across multiple administrative domains
   and across the whole Internet.  This does not preclude using it
   within a single administrative domain.  Although the APONF problem
   statement does not state it explicitly, the APONF protocol would very
   likely be used within a single administrative boundary.

3.2.  Mode of operation

   The NSIS framework and the related NSIS Transport Layer Protocol
   (NTLP) GIST allow the presence of forwarding elements that are not
   NSIS Entities (NE) and do not understand NSIS or GIST.  The most
   degenerated case where only two NEs exist is allowed.  The management
   system and a network element separated by multiple hops would be
   allowed to become GIST adjacent.

   However the sender of the messages is also considered to be the
   originator of the traffic, because GIST has been designed to be path-
   coupled only.  The data used for routing is the same than a NSIS Flow
   Identifier.  Both would have to be decoupled in GIST in order to be
   used in APONF.

3.2.1.  Operation with NAT

   Although not mentioned in the APONF problem statement, it is possible
   that the management application and the network elements are in
   different IP domains and separated by one or multiple NAT devices.
   Operation of NSIS through NAT devices may be problematic because flow
   information is present in the signaling payload.  This problem can be
   circumvented using GIST-aware NAT implementations, a type or
   application-level gateway (ALG) for NSIS.

   In this case however any existing GIST ALG would have to be modified
   in order not to interfere with the protocol.  If flow information is
   exchanged outside of the data path, the flow data is likely to use
   another path through the network that may or not be within the same
   IP domain and go through different NAT devices.

3.3.  Data and State Reporting

   The nature of the data being exchanged and the related messages are
   defined in a NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP).  One or multiple
   new NSLP would have to be defined in the context of APONF in order to
   support the new parameters to be configured and reported on.

3.4.  Authentication, Authorization and Security

   Authentication and confidentiality features are built in the C-mode
   of operation of GIST using TLS.  This part could be used as-is by
   APONF.

   However authentication is performed per node only, against a database
   of known IPs.  If finer-grain authorization were required, for
   example per user or per role, this would have to be added to GIST or
   another NTLP.

3.5.  Existing Implementations

   Two experimental implementations of NSIS have been developed
   independently.  The first is called FreeNSIS and has been implemented
   by a group from the Georg-August University of Goettingen.  It was
   last updated in July 2008.

   A second implementation is called NSIS-ka and is from the Karlsruhe
   Institute of Technology (KIT).  This implementation is more recent
   and includes working NATFW and QoS NSLP.  It is doubtful that the
   interoperability of the two implementations was ever tested.

4.  Gap analysis for Netconf

   To be completed.

5.  Conclusions

   The NSIS framework and NSIS Transport Layer protocol GIST would
   support operation between a management application and a network
   elements separated by multiple hops.  However GIST having been
   designed for path-coupled operation only, it would need to be changed
   significantly to support path-decoupled operation.  Designing another
   NTLP might be another option.

   The design of one or many new NSLP would also be required, depending
   of the type of information exchanged and required message types.

   Overall, the NSIS framework could be used in the context of APONF,
   but feature re-use would be minimal and the amount of modification
   required important.  Given that NSIS has shown very few independent
   implementations and market traction, using it in the context of APONF
   would probably involve a significant amount of work in design,
   implementation and testing.

6.  Security Considerations
