         pretty Easy privacy (pEp): Email Formats and Protocols
                       draft-marques-pep-email-02

Abstract

   The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) propositions for email are based upon
   already existing email and encryption formats (i.e., PGP/MIME) and
   designed to allow for easy implementable and interoperable
   opportunistic encryption: this ranging from key distribution to
   mechanisms of subject encryption.

   The goal of pEp for email is to automatize operations in order to
   make email encryption usable by a wider range of Internet users, to
   achieve wide application of confidentiality and privacy practices in
   the real world.

   This document defines basic operations of pEp's approach towards
   email and two PGP/MIME formats (pEp Email Format 1 and 2) to provide
   certain security guarantees.

   The proposed operations and formats are targeted to Opportunistic
   Security scenarios and are already implemented in several
   applications of pretty Easy privacy (pEp).

1.  Introduction

   This document contains specific propositions to those parts of pretty
   Easy privacy (pEp) [I-D.birk-pep] that are specific to email
   [RFC5322].

   All changes required for the pEp propositions on email to work just
   affect implementers of Mail User Agents (MUAs).

   pretty Easy privacy (pEp) for email is a proposition to both,
   implementers and Internet users, to make end-to-end encryption of
   emails straightforward.

   Whereas Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) and OpenPGP [RFC4880] provide a
   basis for good encryption, we still miss implementations that also
   provide a sufficient level of usability for ordinary Internet users.

   Two users using pEp-enabled mail clients basically don't need to do
   anything else than just writing emails.

   The following example roughly describes a typical pEp scenario:

   1.  Alice - knowing nothing of Bob - just writes an email to Bob:
       this mail is sent out unencrypted.  However, Alice's public key
       is automatically attached.

   2.  Bob can just reply to Alice and - as he got her public key - is
       now able to encrypt a message at this point.  Through a color-
       rating (cf.  [I-D.marques-pep-rating] Bob becomes aware of his
       message now going out in a secure fashion.

   3.  As Alice receives Bob's key, as of now she is also able to send
       secure messages to Bob.

   4.  If Alice and Bob want to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM)
       attacks, they can engage in a Handshake
       [I-D.marques-pep-handshake], comparing their so-called Trustwords
       [I-D.birk-pep-trustwords] and confirm this process if those
       match.  After doing so, their identity rating changes to
       "encrypted and authenticated" [I-D.marques-pep-rating], which
       (UX-wise) can be signaled, e.g., using a green color rating.
       This color rating is also applied to messages (in- and outgoing).

   Note: No propositions are made at this point in time that would
   require implementers to change the behavior or feature set of email
   servers.  Another Internet-Draft may propose changes to the Simple
   Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [RFC5321] as to allow for onion routing
   of email messages in a way metadata can be furtherly protected for
   communication peers - achievable by message encapsulation. pEp's
   email message format 2 described below is already prepared for this
   scenario.

2.  Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   o  Handshake: The process when Alice - e.g. in-person or via phone -
      contacts Bob to verify Trustwords (or by fallback: fingerprints)
      is called Handshake.  [I-D.marques-pep-handshake]

   o  Trustwords: A scalar-to-word representation of 16-bit numbers (0
      to 65535) to natural language words.  When doing a Handshake,
      peers are shown combined Trustwords of both public keys involved
      to ease the comparison.  [I-D.birk-pep-trustwords]

   o  Trust on First Use (TOFU): cf. [RFC7435]

   o  Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM): cf. [RFC4949]

3.  Opportunistic Security with pEp for email

3.1.  Automatic keypair generation

   For every email account a user has in a pEp-enabled Mail User Agent
   (MUA), a different keypair SHOULD be used by default.  If there are
   no keys whatsoever, RSA-4096 keypairs for OpenPGP encryption
   [RFC4880] SHOULD be generated automatically for each email account.
   However, the key length MUST be at least RSA-2048.

   If for an identity there's an RSA keypair with less than 2048 bits,
   new keys MUST be generated.

   [[ TODO: Shouldn't this go to general I-D ]]

3.2.  Key Distribution

   By default, public keys MUST always be attached to any outgoing
   message.

Internet-Draft       pretty Easy privacy (pEp) Email        October 2018


4.  Encryption of email header fields and interoperability

   In pEp, implementers MUST put privacy first: email metadata (i.e.,
   headers) MUST either be omitted or encrypted whenever possible.

   In case of email header encryption: implementers of pEp SHOULD be
   liberal in accepting other approaches to encrypt email headers, but
   MUST use the strict and interoperable pEp formats for any outgoing
   communication.

5.  pEp message formats for email

   The pEp message formats 1 and 2 (as described in the following) are
   email security formats used for sending signed and encrypted emails
   whenever public key(s) for the recipient(s) exist.

5.1.  Unencrypted plain text message with public key attached

   If for a recipient there's no public key available, a pEp message
   MUST be sent out in plain text as MIME message version 1, with
   "Content-Type: multipart/mixed" and the OpenPGP public key attached
   in ASCII armored format, named "pEpkey.asc".

   For a MUA implementer this fulfills two functions:

   1.  It can be easily detected that the sender is a pEp user.

   2.  The MUA (if at least OpenPGP-enabled) can enable the receiving
       user to import the public key to engage in end-to-end encryption
       with the sender; a MUA implementer can also decide to
       automatically import the key such that the user can immediately
       engage in opportunistic encryption.

   The plain text messages SHOULD be sent out with the UTF-8 charset
   Content-Type set.

5.1.1.  Example

   Please note that in the following examples the "pEpkey.asc"
   attachments encoded in base64 format are only shown in its first and
   last line (and otherwise shortened by three points).

5.2.  pEp email format version 1

   pEp email format 1 is an encrypted and signed PGP/MIME format, which
   by default ensures:

   o  correctly signed messages

   o  delivery of public keys (at least and automatically: the sender's
      public key)

   By default, when a public key for a peer is available, pEp-capable
   MUAs are REQUIRED to send out email messages according to [RFC5322]
   and in PGP/MIME format [RFC3156] with the informational "Subject:"
   header field set to "pEp", as follows:

      Subject: pEp

   In turn, the intended human-readable subject (in pEp called short
   message) MUST be moved to the body of the message (in pEp called long

   message) and appear as the first line there. pEp implementers are
   REQUIRED to display the intended "Subject:" field as the real subject
   line in the respective MUAs to help users to easily grasp the real
   subject.

   Alternatively, the "Subject:" header field can also be set to its
   UTF-8 variant with "pEp" written with the equivalence symbol instead
   of an "E":

      Subject: =?utf-8?Q?p=E2=89=A1p?=

   Additionally, a header field "X-Pep-Version: 1.0" is added to signal
   compatibility with pEp email format to pEp-enabled MUAs.

5.2.1.  Example 1

   Example.  Using the well-known example of [RFC5322], an email message
   sent out with pEp in message format 1 looks like this:

5.2.2.  Example 2

   Using the UTF-8 variant of writing "pEp" with the equivalence symbol,
   and an additional document attached (an example PDF attachment), an
   OpenPGP-signed and -encrypted pEp email would look like the
   following:

5.3.  pEp email format version 2

   pEp email format 2 is a strict PGP/MIME format, which by default
   ensures:

   o  correctly signed messages

   o  delivery of public keys (at least: the sender's public key)

   In pEp email format 2 the actual email is encapsulated by an outside
   multipart/encrypted message (i.e., the actual email is sent like a
   forwarded message).

   Headers of messages (received, to be forwarded etc.) can thus be
   preserved in the inner message, which is OpenPGP-signed and
   -encrypted by the application/pgp-encrypted "Content-Type".

   In the outer message, unnecessary email headers MUST be omitted to
   the fullest extent.

   In contrast to pEp email format 1, the public key and other files
   attached cannot be seen in the MIME tree.  The only part which can be
   seen is an application/octet-stream "Content-Type" with name
   "msg.asc".

5.3.1.  Example (Outer and Inner Message)

   A pEp email format 2 message, with the "Subject:" header field set to
   "pEp" looks like the following (please note that the inner message is
   fully contained in the OpenPGP-signed and -encrypted file named
   "msg.asc", including possible attachments and with the sender's
   public key as "pEpkey.asc" attached at the very end):

   It does not only carry the encrypted subject, which pEp implementers
   are supposed to map (UX-wise) such as to replace the "pEp" subject in
   the outer message, but also the actual message (as inline file named
   "msg.txt" in case of plain text) as well as the sender's public key.

6.  Rendering Incoming Messages and Message Rating

   pEp-enabled clients MUST NOT blindly render messages.  Special care
   MUST be taken when rendering the pEp email formats, which provide
   certain guarantees:

   For cases where messages appear unsigned, signed without a key or
   with a bad signature, pEp's privacy rating can be employed to signal
   issues to a user in an easily understandable manner, cf.
   [I-D.marques-pep-rating].

   [[TODO: This needs more work to be understandable. ]]

7.  Encryption to Bcc recipients

7.1.  Algorithm

   For encryption of emails that contain Bcc recipients a simple
   algorithm MAY be used.

   Recipients MUST be partitioned into three lists, one for each of
   three possible outgoing messages:

   1.  To and Cc recipients (without Bcc recipients)

   2.  Bcc recipients unable to encrypt

   3.  Bcc recipients able to encrypt

   It's RECOMMENDED that if the original message the user drafted is
   saved in the user's sent folder, that all recipient fields ("To:",
   "Cc:", "Bcc:") be preserved.

Internet-Draft       pretty Easy privacy (pEp) Email        October 2018


7.1.1.  Split To and Cc recipients from Bcc recipients

   To and Cc recipients MUST be split from the Bcc recipients.

7.1.2.  Split Bcc recipients in two groups

   Bcc recipients MUST be split in two groups:

   o  First group of Bcc recipients who will receive clear text emails.

   o  Second group of Bcc recipients who are able to receive encrypted
      emails.

7.1.3.  Send one email with only To/Cc recipients

   The original email the user drafted SHOULD be sent out with the
   "Bcc:" field removed.

7.1.4.  Send one Bcc email for the first Bcc group

   For the first Bcc group, a regular email message with only Bcc
   recipients is sent.

7.1.5.  Send individual Bcc emails for the second group

   For the second group, individual Bcc email messages are sent.

   [[TODO: This needs more work to make it better understandable. ]]

8.  Saving messages

   [[ TODO: Shouldn't this go to general []

   In accordance to the Privacy by Default principle, messages sent or
   received in encrypted form SHALL be saved with the peer's respective
   public key.

   Messages sent or received in unencrypted form, SHOULD NOT be saved in
   encrypted form on the mail server: this reflects the Privacy Status
   the user encountered when sending or receiving the email and thus
   meets the user's expectations.

   Instead, message drafts MUST always be saved with the user's public
   key.

   Other messages sent and received MUST be saved encrypted by default:
   for most end-user scenarios, the servers users work with, are
   considered untrusted.

Internet-Draft       pretty Easy privacy (pEp) Email        October 2018


   For trusted environments (e.g., in organizations) and to conform to
   legally binding regulations, pEp implementations MUST provide a
   "Trusted Server" option.  With the user's explicit consent (opt-in),
   unencrypted copies of the messages SHALL be held on the mail servers
   controlled by the organization.  This can also help end-users to
   archive their emails without needing access to any key material.

9.  Security Considerations

   [[ TODO ]]

10.  Implementation Status

10.1.  Introduction

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "[...] this will allow reviewers and working
   groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit
   of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
   experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
   more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups to use this
   information as they see fit."

10.2.  Current software implementing pEp

   The following software implementing the pEp protocols (to varying
   degrees) already exists:

   o  pEp for Outlook as add-on for Microsoft Outlook, release
      [SRC.pepforoutlook]

   o  pEp for Android (based on a fork of the K9 MUA), release
      [SRC.pepforandroid]

   o  Enigmail/pEp as add-on for Mozilla Thunderbird, release
      [SRC.enigmailpep]

Internet-Draft       pretty Easy privacy (pEp) Email        October 2018


   o  pEp for iOS (implemented in a new MUA), beta [SRC.pepforios]

   pEp for Android, iOS and Outlook are provided by pEp Security, a
   commercial entity specializing in end-user software implementing pEp
   while Enigmail/pEp is pursued as community project, supported by the
   pEp Foundation.

   All software is available as Free Software and published also in
   source form.

11.  Acknowledgements

   Special thanks go to Krista Bennet and Volker Birk for the reference
   implementation on pEp and the ideas leading to this draft.

   This work was initially created by pEp Foundation, and will be
   reviewed and extended with funding by the Internet Society's Beyond
   the Net Programme on standardizing pEp.  [ISOC.bnet]

      pEp email formats

   o  Create clearer relations to the pEp rating draft (draft-marques-
      pep-rating), as this plays an important role in how messages are
      rendered and how they need to be presented (after rating) for a
      user to have awareness about his privacy status in any given
      situation.

   o  Make document more coherent: check with pEp's general draft pieces
      to fill on both sides and how to reference them vice-versa.

   o  Add existence of internally exposed X-EncStatus header field after
      decrypt and for Trusted Server situations / mirrors and describe
      operations.

   o  Add references to https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-melnikov-
      smime-header-signing-05.txt and https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-
      schaad-rfc5751-bis, as well as align text with those (e.g.
      forwarded=no)

   o  Fix wrong stuff around pEp Message Format 2, especially
      considering the encryption of the whole inner message (including
      To, Cc, and other fields) when dealing with pEp users.

   o  Add pEp Message Format 2.1 (additonal MIME container with preview
      of all headers and some of the initial body text; special case:
      how to treat HTML; e.g., show a text-only snippet?)
