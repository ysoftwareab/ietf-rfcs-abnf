1. Introduction

   Globus (https://www.globus.org) is a software-as-a-service provider
   that develops and operates services and tools for the global
   research and education community.

   Globus provides multiple services for users across many
   institutions, primarily for High Performance Computing driven
   research.  Globus creates unique identifiers which will be persisted
   in external systems, and which must be identifiable as references to
   Globus entities.

Internet-Draft        A URN Namespace for Globus           January 2016


   To address this need, this document requests that a formal URN space
   type be assigned as described in Section 4.3 of RFC 3406.

2. Specification Template

2.1. Namespace ID

   The Namespace ID "globus" is requested.

2.2. Registration Information

   Version 1

   Date: 2016-01-11

2.3. Declared Registrant of the Namespace

   Globus Project Lead
   401 N Michigan Ave
   Suite 900
   Chicago, Illinois, 60611
   USA

   Email:   tuecke@globus.org

   The position of Globus Project Lead is currently filled by Steve
   Tuecke.

2.4. Declaration of the Syntactic Structure

   The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the
   "globus" NID shall have the following structure:

   <URN> ::= "urn:" "globus" ":" <NSS>

   <NSS> ::= <SNID> | <SNID> ":" <subnamespace-specific-string>

   <SNID> ::= 1*<non-colon-chars>

   <subnamespace-specific-string> ::= 1*<URN chars>

   <non-colon-chars> ::= <non-colon-trans> | "%" <hex> <hex>

   <non-colon-trans> ::= <upper> | <lower> | <number> | <non-colon-
   other>

Internet-Draft        A URN Namespace for Globus           January 2016


   <non-colon-other> ::= "(" | ")" | "+" | "," | "-" | "." | "=" |
                         "@" | ";" | "$" | "_" | "!" | "*" | "'"

   The "SNID" is the top-level segment of the NSS.  It is a
   required US-ASCII string, subject to the above syntax, that conforms
   to the URN syntax requirements (see [RFC 2141]).  It identifies a
   category of Globus entities, often associated with a particular
   Globus service. For example "auth" could be used as an SNID for
   identifiers generated by the Globus authentication and authorization
   service (Globus Auth).

   The "subnamespace-specific-string" is an optional US-ASCII string
   and second-level segment of the NSS, belonging to the "SNID"
   context, subject to the above syntax and conformant to the URN
   syntax requirements (see [RFC 2141]).  "subnamespace-specific-string"
   identifies a category of thing within that Globus service, such as
   "scope:transfer.api.globus.org:all"

2.5. Relevant Ancillary Documentation

   None.

2.6. Identifier Uniqueness Considerations

   Identifier uniqueness will be enforced by the Globus Project Lead.
   The Globus Project Lead may sub-delegate part of the namespace to
   third parties.  It will not be permissible, neither by the Globus
   Project Lead nor any third party, to re-assign previously
   assigned URNs.  A practical consequence is that a previously
   assigned subnamespace cannot be re-assigned, unless additional
   arrangements are made to prevent identifier re-assignements.

2.7. Identifier Persistence Considerations

   Identifiers will never be reassigned, but in some circumstances they
   may be invalidated by the Globus Project Lead or by a third party.

2.8. Process of Identifier Assignment

   Assignment of subnamespace identifiers is limited to the Globus
   Project Lead and those authorities that are specifically designated
   by the Globus Project Lead.  The Globus Project Lead may assign
   portions of the globus namespace (specifically, those under
   designated subnamespace identifiers) for assignment by third
   parties.

2.9. Process of Identifier Resolution

   None currently.

   Future versions of this document may define resources that can be
   used to resolve Globus identifiers.

2.10. Rules for Lexical Equivalence

   No additional rules beyond those specified in RFC2141.

2.11. Conformance with URN syntax

   No special considerations.

2.12. Validation Mechanism

   None currently.
   Future versions of this document may define resources that can be
   used to validate Globus identifiers.

2.13. Scope

   Global.

3. Examples (Informative)

   The following examples are based on plans for the Globus URN.  They
   are therefore not guaranteed to be valid.

   The Globus Auth service defines the "auth" SNID, and contains the
   following URNs.

   o  urn:globus:auth:scope:transfer.api.globus.org:all

   o  urn:globus:auth:grants:dependent_token

   A hypothetical service, the Globus Groups service, would have a
   distinct SNID. If that SNID were "groups", it might have URNs such
   as the following.

   o  urn:globus:groups:group:669b572e-9de4-11e5-966e-3c970e0c9cc4

   o  urn:globus:groups:memberships:72e1c6c6-9de4-11e5-966e-
      3c970e0c9cc4

4. Namespace Considerations

   The use of the Globus namespace is expected to be broad, including
   but not limited to usage for:

   o  OAuth2 scopes

   o  OAuth2 custom extension grants

   o  Entity identification for Globus Services

5. Community Considerations

   Members of the Globus community will benefit from persistent and
   globally unique identifiers for use in software and in conformance
   with protocols developed and used by Globus and third-party
   collaborators.

6. Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general,
   which are described in [RFC1737], [RFC2141], and [RFC3406].

7. IANA Considerations

   IANA is kindly requested to register the "globus" namespace
   identifier (NID) into the IANA registry located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces>
