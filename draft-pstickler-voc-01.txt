Internet-Draft             The voc: URI Scheme                March 2002


1. Overview

   The 'voc:' URI scheme is intended for defining controlled
   vocabularies, ontologies, or taxonomies of terms, codes, names,
   symbols, or other representations of abstract concepts for
   communication between web applications.  This includes, among other
   cases, names used to identify XML content model constructs (element
   and attribute names), terms employed by semantic web vocabularies and
   ontologies (class, property, and other resource identities in RDF
   schemata), and controlled code sets for the classification or
   qualification of web resources (standardized codes for language,
   geographic region, encoding, etc).

   The 'voc:' URI scheme belongs to the class of Hierarchical URI
   Schemes as defined in RFC 2396 "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI):
   Generic Syntax" [6] and as such provides for parsing into distinct
   subcomponents, each constituting a hierarchically distinct level.
   The hierarchical characteristics of 'voc:' URIs are discussed later
   in this document.

   Examples:

      voc://w3.org/xhtml-1.4/title
      voc://w3.org/rdf-2.0/resource
      voc://w3.org/rdfs-2.0/subPropertyOf
      voc://iso.ch/3166/DK
      voc://iso.ch/3166/DK/025
      voc://iso.ch/639/fr
      voc://iso.ch/639/fre
      voc://dublincore.org/1.2/date

   These examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not
   necessarily constitute actual URIs.  See the BNF definition below for
   an explicit definition of 'voc:' URI syntax.

2. BNF for the 'voc:' URI Scheme

   This is a BNF-like description of the 'voc:' Uniform Resource
   Identifier syntax, using the conventions of RFC 822[1], except that
   "|" is used to designate alternatives, and brackets [] are used
   around optional or repeated elements.  Briefly, literals are quoted
   with "", optional elements are enclosed in [brackets], and elements

   may be preceded with <n>* to designate n or more repetitions of the
   following element; n defaults to 0.

   This BNF description adopts sub-definitions defined in RFC 1738
   "Uniform Resource Locators (URL)" [2].  The definition of UUID is
   adapted from the Internet Draft draft-kindel-uuid-uri-00 [5] defining
   the UUID string representation conforming to ISO-11578 [4] and
   adopted by RFC 2518 "HTTP Extensions for Distributed Authoring --
   WEBDAV" [3].


   voc-URI        = "voc://" authority [ "/" voc-name [ "/" term-path ] ]
   voc-URI        = "voc://-/" UUID [ "/" term-path ]

   authority      = [ user "@" ] host
   term-path      = term *( "/" term )
   term           = 1*uchar
   voc-name       = 1*uchar

   ; Sub-definitions adopted from draft-kindel-uuid-uri-00:

   UUID           = 8hex "-" 4hex "-" 4hex "-" 4hex "-" 12hex
   hex            = digit | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"

   host           = <as defined by RFC 1738>
   user           = <as defined by RFC 1738>
   digit          = <as defined by RFC 1738>
   uchar          = <as defined by RFC 1738>



3. Hierarchical Characteristics of 'voc:' URIs

   The 'voc:' URI scheme belongs to the class of Hierarchical URI
   Schemes as defined in RFC 2396 "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI):
   Generic Syntax" [6] and as such provides for parsing into distinct
   subcomponents, each constituting a hierarchically distinct level.

   Each 'voc:' URI containing one or more levels beyond the URI
   authority implies a 'voc:' URI for each level up to and including the
   authority level, though implied 'voc:' URIs need not have any
   properties associated with them nor be meaningful to any particular
   system.

   E.g.  the following 'voc:' URI

      voc://getty.edu/TGN/World/North_and_Central_America/United_States/New_Hampshire/Hillsborough/Manchester

Internet-Draft             The voc: URI Scheme                March 2002


   implies all of the following superordinate 'voc:' URIs

      voc://getty.edu/TGN/World/North_and_Central_America/United_States/New_Hampshire/Hillsborough
      voc://getty.edu/TGN/World/North_and_Central_America/United_States/New_Hampshire
      voc://getty.edu/TGN/World/North_and_Central_America/United_States
      voc://getty.edu/TGN/World/North_and_Central_America
      voc://getty.edu/TGN/World
      voc://getty.edu/TGN
      voc://getty.edu

   Note that it is not required that a 'voc:' URI encoded vocabulary
   have any levels beyond the first level of terms below the vocabulary
   name.  Thus, the 'voc:' URI scheme is suitable both for "flat"
   namespaces as well as for hierarchical vocabularies or taxonomies.

   No special meaning or interpretation is ascribed by this
   specification to particular 'voc:' URI levels or to the relations
   between 'voc:' URI levels other than the following:

      o  the first level of an 'voc:' URI corresponds to the authority
         defining the vocabulary (which may be implicit in a UUID
         vocabulary name as indicated by a hyphen '-')

      o  the second level of a 'voc:' URI corresponds to the vocabulary
         name

      o  each of the levels beyond the second level correspond to a
         vocabulary term

      o  the resource denoted by the 'voc:' URI for a term level is
         subordinate in some manner to all resources denoted by each
         term level 'voc:' URI implied by its hierarchical structure

   A given application may choose to conduct queries based on implied
   superordinate 'voc:' URIs to retrieve any properties of any
   superordinate resources which may be relevant to the interpretation
   of a given 'voc:' URI.

   Other, more specialized, URI schemes which are derived from the
   'voc:' URI scheme may ascribe more specific interpretations to
   particular levels implicit in the URI as well as more specific
   relational semantics between different levels.

   Note that the URI scheme prefix "voc:" is considered to be a valid
   URI denoting this URI scheme, though it is not itself a valid URI
   according to this URI scheme.

4. Support for Autogenerated Vocabularies

   The UUID form of a 'voc:' URI is intended for cases where a
   temporary, autodefined vocabulary of terms must be used.  This is
   especially useful for RDF processors when encountering XML
   vocabularies not qualified by XML namespaces.  In such cases, an RDF
   parser can autogenerate a UUID scope for each instance, to serve as a
   unique per-instance vocabulary of local names, which ensures that
   identical unqualified (local) names from different instances do not
   collide in a knowledge base syndicated from multiple sources.  This
   provides a more robust and safe treatment of unqualified names than
   the 'online:' or 'genid:' treatments employed by most RDF systems to
   date.

5. Security Considerations

   This document raises no known security issues.
