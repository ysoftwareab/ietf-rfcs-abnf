Abstract 

   This draft describes a YANG data model to manipulate the topologies 
   of a layer 1 Optical Transport Network (OTN). It is independent of 
   control plane protocols and captures topology related information 
   pertaining to OTN and also enables manipulation of an OTN network 
   via the I2RS interface.

1. Introduction 

   This document defines a data model of a layer one network topology, 
   using YANG [RFC6020]. The model can be used by an application 
   exposing to a management system. Moreover, it can also be used by an 
   application via the I2RS interface [draft-ietf-i2rs-architecture], 
   in the following ways (but not limited to):  

     o to obtain a whole view of the network topology information of 
   its interest e.g., via a network element or maybe a Path

   Computation Element (PCE) or a network management system within the 
   network ;  

      o to receive notifications with regard to the information of the 
   change of the network topology of its interest; 

      o to enforce the establishment/update of a network topology with 
   the characteristic specified in the data model, e.g., by a network 
   controller or a client controller to manipulate the network provided 
   by the provider for flexible control and management; 

   The YANG model defined in this draft is independent of control plane 
   protocols and captures topology related information pertaining to an 
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN) and also enables manipulation of an 
   OTN network via the I2RS interface. Other network layers, such as 
   fixed Dense Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON) and flexible 
   optical networks (a.k.a., flexi-grid networks) are covered in [WSON-
   YANG] and [Flexi-YANG], respectively. 

2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 
   [RFC2119]. 

3. Terminology and Notations 

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in 
   this document. The meaning of the symbols in the YANG data tree 
   presented later in this draft is defined in [ietf-netmod-rfc6087bis]. 
   They are provided below for reference. 

     o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys. 

      o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration 
   (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only). 

      o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"  
   means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list. 

      o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are 
   also marked with a colon (":"). 

      o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not 
   shown.

4. YANG Data Model for Layer 1 Topology 

   [Editor's note: It was agreed that the model presented in this draft 
   will be augmenting from TE topology YANG, which is not available 
   during the time of writing due to its revision to augment from the 
   generic topology YANG produced in I2RS WG. So, this issue will be 
   addressed in the further versions of this draft.]

4.1.1. Augmentation  

   As can be seen in the YANG module presented augments from a more 
   generic network topology model, i.e., the ietf-network-topology YANG 
   module as specified in [draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo]. This is 
   to follow the network model structure suggested in [draft-ietf-i2rs-
   yang-network-topo] figure 1. 

   [Editor's note: how TE topo YANG fits in this figure has been 
   discussed and yet to be updated in that draft.] 

4.1.2. The node and link list 

   The module presented in this draft contains all the nodes and links 
   information pertaining to a layer one network. As specified in the 
   ietf-network YANG module, a node is identified by the node-id, which 
   is unique within the network. Within the nodes, all the interfaces 
   pertaining to this node and their potential capabilities/constraints 
   SHOULD be present. Besides this, the constraints associated with a 
   node as a whole SHOULD also be present, such as the connectivity 
   constraints introduced due to abstraction or due to the hardware 
   limitations.  

   Similarly, a link is identified by the link-id, which is unique 
   within a node. It includes the association with nodes as well as 
 
 
Zhang et al               Expires June 2016                   [Page 5] 

draft-zhang-ccamp-l1-topo-yang-02.txt                     December 2015 
    

   interfaces. Moreover, it includes information that is of interest to 
   the management and I2RS client, for purposes, such as path 
   computation, monitoring etc. For termination points, physical 
   information is provided as an optional feature and it provides 
   additional information to allow management/I2RS client to be better 
   informed of this attribute and can help visualize and simply the 
   operation of termination points selection. 

   [editor's note]: for next update: any specific information related 
   to an OTN interface has to be described in the context of 
   technologic specific extension of OTN-TDM ISCD".  

   Since for an optical transport network, its client interface 
   attributes may be different with that of the links within the 
   network. For full control purpose, this attributes and information 
   are also captured and listed in this YANG module. 

4.1.3. Notification 

   Two types of notifications are introduced: node failure and link 
   failure.

5. Security Considerations 

   Since the data model defined in this draft is manipulated via the 
   I2RS interface. The security concerns mentioned in [draft-ietf-i2rs-
   architecture] also applies to this draft. 
    
   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via   
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the   
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure   
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model   
   [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for particular   
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF   
   protocol operations and content. 
    
   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which 
   are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the   
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or 
   vulnerable in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., 
   <edit-config>) to these data nodes without proper protection can 
   have a negative effect on network operations. 
    
   [Editor's note: to List specific subtrees and data nodes and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability.]

6. Manageability Considerations  

   TBD. 
    
7. IANA Considerations 

   TBD.  
    
8. Acknowledgements 

   The initial YANG model specified in this draft is based on draft-
   clemm-i2rs-yang-network-topo but it is modified according to the 
   features of the layer one networks. 
    
   We would like to thank the authors of the above mentioned draft for 
   their helpful discussion during the creation of this draft.
