Internet-Draft     Efficient XML Encoding and 6LowApp       October 2009


1.  Introduction

   For the resource constrained devices and networks of 6LowApp
   [I-D.bormann-6lowpan-6lowapp-problem] it is essential that the
   message payloads are compact.  The use of XML to represent data in
   web applications has become almost universal.  The interoperability
   of 6LowApp with these applications will require that XML can also be
   carried over the embedded web.  Examples include Smart Energy using
   IEC XML markup, building automation with open Building Information
   Exchange (oBIX), and the OGC Sensor Markup Language (SensorML)
   [OGC-SensorML] to name a few.  In the vast majority of enterprise and
   machine-to-machine (M2M) systems it is expected that data is
   represented in some form of XML.  The size of typical XML payloads
   for even simple sensor data ranges from 100s to 1000s of bytes.  This
   overhead is unreasonable over e.g. 6LoWPAN networks [RFC4944].
   Furthermore, full XML parsing requires additional resources from
   embedded devices.

   Fortunately, the text form of XML we are all familiar with is only
   one way to represent an XML document or fragment.  XML can also be
   respresented using much more compact and easy to parse encodings.
   The underlying XML Information Set is the same.  One good example is
   the new Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) standard from the W3C
   [W3C.WD-exi-20080919].  This alternative encoding for XML represents
   namespaces, tags, attributes and data using optimal bit codes,
   supporting very simple encoding/decoding based on well-known schema
   knowledge.  Other examples include the Binary XML (BXML)
   specification from the OGC [OGC-BXML], the Fast Infoset (FI) standard
   from the ITU [FI] and the WAP Binary XML (WBXML) technique from the
   mobile industry.

   This document introduces and compares techniques for encoding or
   compressing XML for use with 6LowApp including EXI, BXML and Fast
   Infoset.  The performance and requirements for using these encodings
   are analyzed in the scope of 6LowApp.  It is shown that these
   standard encodings can represent XML in a compact form, with
   reasonable overhead, and require only Internet media type and
   possible transfer encoding indication from the application protocol.


2.  Efficient XML Encoding

   In this section we introduce a few of the promising efficient XML
   encoding schemes available as standards or draft standards.  We are
   aware of other standard encodings such as WBXML and compression
   schemes like gzip and deflate.  These techniques have similar
   properties and requirements to the ones presented here.  In general
   techniques can be categorized into two categories, encoding

Internet-Draft     Efficient XML Encoding and 6LowApp       October 2009


   techniques and compression techniques.  The following three
   techniques can be categorized as encodings, which are typically more
   suitable for very limited devices.

2.1.  Efficient XML Interchange (EXI)

   EXI is a very compact representation for the XML Information Set that
   is intended to simultaneously optimize performance and the
   utilization of computational resources [W3C.WD-exi-20080919].  The
   EXI format uses a hybrid approach drawn from the information and
   formal language theories, plus practical techniques verified by
   measurements, for entropy encoding XML information.  Using a
   relatively simple algorithm, which is amenable to fast and compact
   implementation, and a small set of data types, it reliably produces
   efficient encodings of XML event streams.  The event production
   system and format definition of EXI are introduced in
   [W3C.WD-exi-primer-20071219].

   The EXI specification allows for a simplified mode of operation
   called schema-informed mode.  Here a schema is used to form a grammar
   and state-machine limited to that schema, enabling an extremely
   efficient encoding.  The result of the simple state machine is that
   even the most minimal embedded devices can work directly with the
   encoding without the need to work with a full XML parser.

2.2.  Fast Infoset (FI)

   Fast Infoset is an ITU-T (X.891) [FI] and ISO (IEC 24824-1) defined
   standard that specifies a binary encoding for the XML Information
   Set. Unlike other XML representations, the Fast Infoset standard has
   the dual benefits of both compression and performance, making it the
   ideal choice for moving large XML data between disparate low
   bandwidth systems or for high performance systems such as those
   utilizing Web services.

2.3.  Binary XML (BXML)

   BXML is a straightforward encoding for XML that is designed for
   efficient processing in general with an emphasis on dense numeric
   data, which is one of the weakest areas for textual XML.  This
   encoding specification designed by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
   is specified for GML compression [OGC-BXML].  Thus it is an
   interesting technique even though it is still in best practices phase
   and currently meant only for GML.  It is open and about as
   straightforward to implement a parser/generator for as for textual
   XML.

3.  Results

   In this section the results of encoding XML content with EXI, BXML
   and Fast Infoset techniques are presented.  The goal is to give an
   example of how the encoding of some typical XML content for simple
   embedded devices works.  In this comparison RDF/XML sensor data, a
   Smart Energy example and a simplified SensorML example have been used
   which represent a good range of content for 6LowApp applications.

   The results were carried out using EXIficcient v0.3 [EXIficient] and
   FastInfoset v1.1.9 [FI@GlassFish] from GlassFish along with a custom
   BXML implementation from CENTRIA [Locawe-BXML].  All test content had
   a corresponding XML Schema, and the original content size was
   normalized.  EXI encoding was performed in schema-informed mode using
   bit-alignment.  Fast Infoset and BXML were both performed with schema
   information.  Complexity is considered for using the technique on
   constrained microcontrollers and was estimated based on
   implementations of EXI and BXML on CC2430 and MSP430 platforms, and
   an estimation of FI complexity to be similar to BXML.

   The following figures show the XML content used for the comparison:

             Figure 3: XML content used for the SensorML Test

   Table 1 presentes the comparison results.  The results show that EXI
   encoding represents XML content much more efficiently than BXML and
   FI encodings.  The main reason for this can be found from the
   simplicity of EXI encoding, and the efficiency of its schema-informed
   grammar that resulsts in a limited state machine.  The result is
   close to that achievable when representing the same raw data content
   in ASN.1.  BXML encoding in turn will encode not only the values but
   also a part of the XML structure.  However, BXML also offers also
   possibility to store the most common structures in a separate global
   string table which can be stored and used locally in the node side
   like the schema file of EXI encoding.  The structure of BXML is
   closer to the stuctures of OGC's markups.  Although not very dense,
   an advantage of BXML is its readability.  Fast Infoset works like a
   compression algorithm for XML, although with higher performance than
   gzip.  The results of Fast Infoset and BXML are on averge equivalent.
   Further test results for full web content for a wide range of
   encoding and compression techniques can be found from
   [W3C.WD-exi-evaluation-20090407].

4.  6LowApp Requirements

   The use of compact XML encoding requires very little from the
   application protocol of 6LowApp.  In practice just a payload, and a
   way to indicate in the header what the Internet media type and the
   content transfer encoding of that payload are.  This allows these
   standard techniques to be used without modification.  One technique



Shelby, et al.           Expires April 19, 2010                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     Efficient XML Encoding and 6LowApp       October 2009


   for encoding the type and transfer encoding in a binary header is
   included in [I-D.frank-6lowapp-chopan].

   When performing application commissioning in 6LowApp some well-known
   encoding must be used or included in the commissioning technique.  If
   the same application protocol is used also for commissioning, such as
   done with DPWS, then the payload should use a well-known markup (XML)
   and encoding.  Based on the findings here, EXI would be a recommended
   choice for XML.

   The Internet media types (MIME) [RFC2046] should be indicated by the
   application protocol header.  This SHOULD be encoded in a compact
   form.  Examples of typical content-types that need to be supported
   for efficient XML encoding:

   o  text/xml [RFC3023]

   o  application/xml [RFC3023]

   o  application/rdf+xml [RFC3870]

   o  application/soap+xml [RFC3902]

   o  application/atom+xml [RFC5023]

   o  application/rss+xml

   o  text/x-bxml, application/x-bxml and *+x-bxml [OGC-BXML]

   o  application/fastinfoset, application/soap+fastinfoset and
      *+fastinfoset [FI]

   o  Unknown binary content SHOULD be treated as application/
      octet-stream [RFC2045][RFC2046]

   o  For simplicity it is not recommended that multipart/mixed is
      supported.

   The content transfer encoding [RFC2045] should be optionally
   indicated by the application protocol header, and is needed at least
   by EXI.  This SHOULD be encoded in a compact form.  At least the
   following need to be supported:

   o  x-exi [W3C.WD-exi-best-practices-20071219]

   o  binary

5.  Conclusions

   Efficient XML encoding will be a key technology for enabling the
   embedded web, which 6LowApp will benefit greatly by supporting.  The
   results of this analysis show that efficient XML encoding is possible
   within the payload and complexity constraints aimed at by 6LowApp.
   Although it was found that EXI is highly suitable for these types of
   applications, the conclusion is that any of these and other encodings
   may be appropriate depending on the application.

   The recommendation is that 6LowApp should support a reasonable range
   of Internet media types and transfer encodings related to XML and
   common XML encodings.
