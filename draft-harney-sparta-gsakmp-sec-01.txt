                                  Abstract


     The Group Secure Association Key Management Protocol (GSAKMP)
    provides a security framework for creating cryptographic groups on
    a network.  It provides mechanisms to disseminate group security
    policy, perform access control based upon PKI certificates,
    generate group keys, and recover from compromise.  This framework
    addresses group scalability issues by facillitating delegation of
    process-intensive actions in a secure and controlled manner.

INTERNET-DRAFT                    GSAKM Protocol                    May 2000

1 Overview


The Group Secure Association Key Management Protocol (GSAKMP) provides
symmetric key to groups of users on a network.  It provides mechanisms to
disseminate group policy, perform access control decisions during group
establishment, generate group keys, recover from the compromise of group
members, delegate group security functions and destroy the group.

The goals of the GSAKMP are to create a protocol that:



1.  Distributes group policy,

2.  Provides mechanisms for distributing the group key, and

3.  Provides mechanisms for a Rekey of the group.


1.1 GSAKMP Overview


Protecting information requires the definition of a security policy and the
enforcement of that policy by capable parties.  Control and access to the
cryptographic key is the primary mechanism to enforce the access control
policy.  The GSAKMP provides these mechanisms to control access to the group
key.

This document identifies the GSAKMP Message Passing Requirements.  The group
key(s) are created by the group controller.  The group controller must start
the group access control, policy enforcement process.  The group controller
needs to have the access rules defined for joining the group and should be
able to identify and verify the permissions of the members to which they
will distribute keys.

The potential group members need to have ``knowledge'' of the access control
policy for the group, an unambiguous identification of any party downloading
keys to them, and verifiable chain of authority for key download.  The group
members also need to verify that the key creator is authorized to act in
that capacity.

In order to establish a group Secure Association (SA) to support these
activities, the identity of each party in the security/access control
process must be unambiguously stated/asserted and authenticated to ensure
that they are authorized to be a member of the group as defined by the
group's security policy.  The security characteristics of the establishment
protocol for the SA should include:


1.  Coherent permission topology,

INTERNET-DRAFT                    GSAKM Protocol                    May 2000

2.  Group policy,

3.  Group policy dissemination,

4.  Peer SA to protect data, and

5.  Access control checking.



1.2 Assumptions


GSAKMP makes the following assumptions of the underlying host:


1.  The operating system can provide the process and data separation
    services to support software encryption.

2.  A separate SA mechanism is present that is sufficient to protect the
    distribution of the group key.

3.  The host and all the applications on that host share the same
    certificate identities (at least initially).


1.3 Document Organization


Section 1 presents an overview of secure group communications and identifies
additional reference documents.  Section 2 presents the terminology and
concepts used to present the requirements of this protocol.  Section 3
describes the group management life-cycle and Section 4 presents the message
types and formats used during each phase of the life-cycle.  Section 5
presents a discussion of the states encountered in the protocol.

2 Terminology


The following terminology is used throughout the GSAKMP paper.



2.1 GSAKMP Terminology


Group Member:   A group member (GM) is any entity with access to the group
    keys.  Regardless of how a member becomes a part of the group or how the
    group is structured, GMs will perform the following actions:


    1.  Validate the GC's authorization to perform actions;

    2.  Accept group keys from the GC;

    3.  Request group keys from the GC;

    4.  Maintain local Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs);

    5.  Enforce the cooperative group policies as stated in the group
        policy token;

    6.  Perform peer review of key management actions; and

    7.  Manage their local key.


Group Secure Association (GSA):  A cryptographic group is a logical
    association of users or hosts that share cryptographic key(s).  This
    group may be established to support associations between applications or
    communication protocols.

Group Policy:   The group policy completely describes the protection
    mechanisms and security relevant behaviors of the group.  This policy
    must be commonly understood and enforced by the group for coherent
    secure operations.

Policy Token/Certificate:   The policy token is a mechanism used to
    disseminate the group policy.  The policy token is issued and signed
    by an authorized source.  Each member of the group must verify the
    token, meet the group join policy , and enforce the policy of the group.
    The group policy data element will contain a variety of information
    including:


    1.  GSAKMP protocol format,



Harney/Colegrove/Harder/Meth/Fleischer                              [Page 9]


INTERNET-DRAFT                    GSAKM Protocol                    May 2000

    2.  Key creation method,

    3.  Key dissemination policy,

    4.  Access control policy,

    5.  Group architecture policy, and

    6.  Compromise recovery policy.



    The policy token layout will be fully presented in the Group Policy
    Token Specification document.

Group Controller:   The Group Controller (GC) is a group member with
    authority to perform any critical protocol actions including:


    1.  Creating and distributing keys;

    2.  Maintain the Rekey infrastructure; and

    3.  Building and maintaining the Rekey arrays.


    As the group evolves, it may become desirable to have multiple
    controllers perform these functions (e.g., Rekey Controller and Group
    Key Controller).

Subordinate Controller:   Any group member, as defined in the group policy,
    has the capability to act as a Subordinate Controller (SC) thus allowing
    the group processing and communication requirements to be distributed
    equitably throughout the network.  If the group is structured in
    such a way, the delegated group members would be identified via the
    policy token.  The SCs may perform actions delegated to them by the GC
    including:


    1.  Dissemination of the group key and

    2.  Management of the status of the local group.


    The ease of managing a very large group may also be improved by
    delegating the creation of subordinate LKH arrays to the SCs.  The
    SCs would have the authority and mechanisms necessary to create and
    disseminate the LKH arrays for the members under their control.  A
    more detailed discussion of LKH arrays may be found in the Logical Key
    Hierarchy (LKH) Protocol document.

INTERNET-DRAFT                    GSAKM Protocol                    May 2000

Peer-to-Peer SA:  Peer-to-Peer SA keys can be created by using any number
    of key generation protocols including the Internet Secure Association
    Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)/IPSec and HS/SSL. These protocols
    rely on cooperative key generation algorithms and on peer review of
    permissions.  Modern SA protocols are specifically developed to support
    this task.  Once the peer-to-peer SA is established, the group protocol
    can use that SA mechanism for secure confidential peer communications
    throughout the life of the group.

GSA Keys:   GSA keys can be created using strong randomization key
    generation protocols.  These protocols rely on a cooperatively conferred
    policy.  Once the group keys are created and disseminated to the
    group members, the group protocol can use that SA mechanism for secure
    confidential group communications throughout the life of the group.

Group Traffic Encryption Key (GTEK):  The key or keys created for
    encrypting the group data.

Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) array:   The group of keys created to
    facilitate the LKH compromise recovery methodology.

Compromise Recovery:   The act of recovering a secure operating state after
    detecting that a group member cannot be trusted.

3 GROUP LIFE-CYCLE


The management of a cryptographic group follows a life-cycle:  group
definition, group establishment, group maintenance, and group removal.
Each of these life-cycle phases is discussed in the following sections.
A cryptographic group is established based on some need for secure
communications among a group of individuals.  The activities involved in
creating a cryptographic group include:



1.  Determine Access Policy:  Group Join

2.  Determine Authorization Policy:  Key Dissemination, Computer Trust, and
    Architecture Authorization

3.  Determine Mechanisms:  Algorithms and Infrastructure

4.  Determine Architecture:  Key Dissemination and Compromise Recovery

5.  Create Group Policy Token


For the purposes of this document, it is assumed that the group definition
activity has occurred and the group information has been broadcast on a key
management channel or through a directory service.


3.1 Group Establishment


The Group Establishment Ladder diagram, Figure 1, is presented to illustrate
the process of establishing a cryptographic group.  The left side of the
diagram represents the actions of the GC. The right side of the diagram
represents the actions of the GMs.  The components of each message shown in
the diagram are presented in the Message Definitions sections following the
diagram.

Potential GMs may join a group in two ways:  by invitation (push) or request
(pull).  For purposes of illustration, the diagram presents a ``Request to
Join Group'', a ``pull'', message sent from a potential GM.

At this point, the GC must accept or deny the request.  ``Process RTJ``
indicates a provision for refusing the connection due to some specified
reason (e.g., no group, group full, repetitive attempts to join).  If the
results of ``Process RTJ`` indicate that the GC should reject the request,
the session is terminated.
If the results of Processing the Request To Join indicate that the GC

an invited potential member also begins at this point on the diagram.

               Figure 1:  Group Establishment Ladder Diagram


The area of the diagram specified as ``Outside GSAKMP'' is merely
illustrative to show the confidentiality between the GC and GM. It is
assumed, for the purposes of this document, that the GC and GM are able to
establish a SA using protocols like ISAKMP and IPSec.  The GC will specify
the security characteristics of the SA to the outside application.  The
level of protection shall be as good or stronger than the SA characteristics
specified in the group policy token.  A suggested minimal SA security level
is confidentiality with integrity.

To facilitate a well ordered group creation, security policy information
must be passed between the GC and the GMs using a group policy token.  The
group policy token must include the group's address, group permissions,
group join policy, group controller identity, group management information,
and digital signature of the policy creation authority.


3.1.1 Create Group Key


There are two options:  key generation at a single point and shared
generation.  In shared generation, the first member must cooperate with the
GC to create the group key.  There are several established software-based
key creation protocols, including Diffie-Hellman and RSA, that support two
group members cooperating to create a cryptographic key.  However, for this
document, the following discussion presents single-point key generation.
Prior to the first member join, the GC will have created the GTEK and the
Rekey array.

3.1.2 Distribute Group Key


Potential GMs may join a group and receive the group key in two ways:  by
invitation (push) or request (pull).  The following message definition shows
a Request to Join message from a potential GM. The initial message from the
GM would contain the following:



1.  GSA request and

2.  GM Certificate (optional).


The components of a Request to Join message are are shown in Table 1:

                Table 1:  Request To Join Message Definition

    Message Name  : Request to Join
    Dissection    : {HDR, Grp ID, GSA RQ} SigM, [CertM]
    Payload Types : GSAKMP Header, Notification, Signature,
                    [Certificate], [Certificate Request], [Vendor

    []            : Indicate an optional data item

The following message definition shows an ``Invitation to Join'' message
from the GC to a potential GM. The initial message from the GC would contain
the following:


1.  Signed group policy token,


2.  GSA request, and


3.  GC Certificate (optional).


The components of an Invitation to Join message are shown in Table 2:

For purposes of discussion, this section presents a ``Invitation to Join''
as presented in Table 2.

The GM will receive this message and process it according to the provisions
of Processing the Invitation.  The GSA RQ contains the identity of the

message source in enough detail to allow the potential member to verify
the signature.  The GSA RQ also contains the ID of the invited member.  In
``Process Inv.``, the potential GM will initially verify that the signature
on the message is authentic.  If the message signature does not verify, the
session is terminated.  GSAKMP sends a properly authenticated message with a
Notification Payload of type NACK to indicate termination.

If the message signature is authentic, then the potential GM will look
at who signed the message, verify the signer's authorization, and make
a decision to proceed.  If the potential GM decides not to proceed, the
session is terminated.  GSAKMP sends a properly authenticated message with
a Notification Payload of type NACK to indicate termination.

If the potential GM has decided to continue, they will examine the
information within the policy token to determine if this is a group they are
authorized and interested in joining.  If the decision is not to join, the
session is terminated.  GSAKMP sends a properly authenticated message with a
Notification Payload of type NACK to indicate termination.

If the potential GM is satisfied with the received information and decides
to join the group, he will pass back a message containing the following:


1.  Signed GSA response, and


2.  GM's certificate (optional).


The components of an Invitation Response message are shown in Table 3:

    {}SigX         :Indicates minimum fields used in Signature
    []            : Indicate an optional data item


The GC receives this message and processes it according to the provisions
of Processing the Invitation Response.  In this procedure, the GC will
verify the signature on the message to ensure its authenticity.  If the
message signature does not verify, the session is terminated.  GSAKMP sends
a properly authenticated message with a Notification Payload of type NACK to
indicate termination.

If the message signature is verified, and the GM passes the GC's Access
Control checks, the GC will create and send a signed message containing the
GTEK and the Rekey array to the GM.

The components of a Key Download message are shown in Table 4:


                 Table 4:  Key Download Message Definition

    {}SigX         :Indicates minimum fields used in Signature
    []            : Indicate an optional data item

The GM receives this message and processes it according to the provisions
of Processing the Key Download.  In this procedure, the GM will verify
the signature on the message to ensure its authenticity.  If the message
signature does not verify, the session is terminated.  GSAKMP sends a
properly authenticated message with a Notification Payload of type NACK to
indicate termination.

If the message signature is verified, the GM will create a signed
acknowledgment message to return to the GC.

The components of an Acknowledgment message are shown in Table 5:


                Table 5:  Acknowledgment Message Definition

    Message Name  : Acknowledgment
    Dissection    : {HDR, ACK}SigM, [CertM]

    Legend        :
    SigM          : Signature of Group Member
    CertM         : Certificate of Group Member
    {}SigX         :Indicates minimum fields used in Signature
    []            : Indicate an optional data item

The GC receives the signed acknowledgment and processes it according to
the provision of Processing the Acknowledgement.  In this procedure, the GC
will verify the signature on the message to ensure its authenticity.  If the
message signature does not verify, the session is terminated.  GSAKMP sends
a properly authenticated message with a Notification Payload of type NACK to
indicate termination.

If the message signature is verified, then the GC and GM have established a
Shared Keyed Group Session.



3.2 Group Maintenance


The Group Maintenance phase includes member joins and leaves, group rekey
activities, and the management of Rekey events.  These activities are
presented in the following sections.


3.2.1 Member Joins/Leaves


The addition of group members to a previously established group will closely
follow the processing presented in Section 3.1 -- Group Establishment.  With
the exception of the pure group establishment tasks (e.g., creation of
policy token, GTEK, and Rekey array), an entity becomes a GM using the same
message exchanges described in Section 3.1.

A member who elects to voluntarily leave the group will be responsible for
destroying his key.  Any further action for a voluntary leave should be
specifically addressed in the group's security policy.

INTERNET-DRAFT                    GSAKM Protocol                    May 2000

3.2.2 Rekey Events


A Rekey event is any action, including compromises, that involves the
creation and dissemination of a new group key and/or Rekey information.

Once it has been identified, using the group's security policy, that a Rekey
event has occurred, the GC must create and send a signed message containing
the GTEK and Rekey array to the group.

Each GM who receives this message must verify the signature on the message
to ensure its authenticity.  If the message signature does not verify,
the session is terminated.  GSAKMP sends a properly authenticated message
with a Notification Payload of type NACK to indicate termination.  Upon
verification the GM will find the appropriate Rekey download packet and
decrypt the information with a stored Rekey key.

The components of a Rekey Event message are shown in Table 6:


                  Table 6:  Rekey Event Message Definition

    Message Name  : Rekey Event
    Dissection    : {HDR, Grp ID, [Policy Token], Rekey Array}SigC,
                    [CertC]
    Payload Types : GSAKMP Header, [Policy Token], Rekey Event,
                    Signature, [Certificate], [Vendor ID],
                    [Identification/Role]

    {}SigX         :Indicates minimum fields used in Signature
    []            : Indicate an optional data item



3.3 Group Removal/Destruction


At this point in the group's life-cycle, there has been a decision to
destroy the group and the notification is broadcast on a key management
channel or through a directory service.

The components of a Group Removal/Destruction message are shown in Table 7:

Message ID (4 octets)  - Unique Message Identifier used to identify
    protocol state during negotiations.  This value is randomly generated
    by the initiator of communications for each group join activity.  In
    the event of simultaneous GSA establishments (i.e., collisions), the
    value of this field may be different because they are independently
    generated and, thus, two group security associations will progress
    toward establishment.  However, it is unlikely there will be absolute
    simultaneous establishments.

4.2 Generic Payload Header


Each GSAKMP payload defined in the following sections begins with a generic
header, shown in Figure 3, which provides a payload ``chaining`` capability
and clearly defines the boundaries of a payload.  The Generic Payload Header
fields are defined as follows:

     0                   1                   2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-!



                     Figure 3:  Generic Payload Header


Next Payload (1 octet)  - Identifier for the payload type of the next
    payload in the message.  If the current payload is the last in
    the message, then this field will be 0.  This field provides the
    ``chaining`` capability.

RESERVED (1 octet)  - Unused, set to 0.

Payload Length (2 octets)  - Length in octets of the current payload,
    including the generic payload header.

There are instances within GSAKMP where it is necessary to represent
Data Attributes.  These Data Attributes are not a GSAKMP payload, but
are contained within GSAKMP payloads.  The format of the Data Attributes
provides the flexibility for representation of many different types of
information.  There can be multiple Data Attributes within a payload.
The length of the Data Attributes will either be 4 octets or defined by
the Attribute Length field.  This is done using the Attribute Format bit
described in Figure 4.

     0                   1                   2                   3

                     Figure 4:  Data Attributes Payload

The Data Attributes fields are defined as follows:


Attribute Type (2 octets)  - Unique identifier for each type of attribute.
    The most significant bit, or Attribute Format (AF), indicates whether
    the data attributes follow the Type/Length/Value (TLV) format or a
    shortened Type/Value (TV) format.  If the AF bit is a zero (0), then the
    Data Attributes are of the Type/Length/Value (TLV) form.  If the AF bit
    is a one (1), then the Data Attributes are of the Type/Value form.

Attribute Length (2 octets)  - Length in octets of the Attribute Value.
    When the AF bit is a one (1), the Attribute Value is only 2 octets and
    the Attribute Length field is not present.

Attribute Value (variable length)  - Value of the attribute associated with
    the GSAKMP-specific Attribute Type.  If the AF bit is a zero (0), this
    field has a variable length defined by the Attribute Length field.  If
    the AF bit is a one (1), the Attribute Value has a length of 2 octets.



4.4 Policy Token Payload


The Policy Token Payload contains group specific information that describes
the group security relevant behaviors, access control parameters, and

4.5 Key Download Payload


The Key Download Payload contains group keys.  These key download payloads
can have several security attributes applied to them based upon the security
policy of the group.  Figure 6 shows the format of the payload.

If the security policy of the group dictates, the key download payload may
be encrypted with a key exchange key (KEK). The type of encryption used is
specified in the Policy Token.  The group members may create the KEK using
the key creation method identified in the Key Creation Payload.

The Key Download Payload fields are defined as follows:


Next Payload (1 octet)  - Identifier for the payload type of the next
    payload in the message.  If the current payload is the last in the

The Certificate Request Payload provides a means to request certificates
via GSAKMP and can appear in any message.  Certificate Request payloads
SHOULD be included in an exchange whenever an appropriate directory service
(e.g., Secure DNS [DNSSEC]) is not available to distribute certificates.
The Certificate Request payload MUST be accepted at any point during the
exchange.  The responder to the Certificate Request payload MUST send its
certificate, if certificates are supported, based on the values contained
in the payload.  If multiple certificates are required, then multiple
Certificate Request payloads SHOULD be transmitted.  Figure 10 shows the
format of the Certificate Request Payload.

    including the generic payload header.

Certificate Type (1 octet)  - Contains an encoding of the type of
    certificate requested.

Certificate Authority (variable length)  - Contains an encoding of an
    acceptable certificate authority for the type of certificate requested.
    As an example, for an X.509 certificate this field would contain the
    Distinguished Name encoding of the Issuer Name of an X.509 certificate
    authority acceptable to the sender of this payload.  This would be
    included to assist the responder in determining how much of the
    certificate chain would need to be sent in response to this request.  If
    there is no specific certificate authority requested, this field SHOULD
    NOT be included.



The payload type for the Certificate Request Payload is six (6).


4.10 Signature Payload


The Signature Payload contains data generated by the digital signature
function.  The digital signature covers the Signature Payload Span and the
Signature Payload up to the Signature Data.  The exception to this is if
the signature algorithm used is DSS with ASN.1/DER encoding.  Due to the
variable length of a DER encoding, the signature span across the signature
payload itself only extends up to the signature data length field, not the
signature data.  Figure 11 shows the format of the Signature Payload.

The Signature Payload fields are defined as follows:


Next Payload (1 octet)  - Identifier for the payload type of the next
    payload in the message.  If the current payload is the last in the
    message, then this field will be 0.

RESERVED (1 octet)  - Unused, set to 0.

Payload Length (2 octets)  - Length in octets of the current payload,
    including the generic payload header.

Signature Type (1 octet)  -- Indicates the type of signature.  Table 16
    presents the Signature Types.

Signature Payload Span (4 octets)  - Identifies the information included in
    the signature.  The first two octets define the first signature payload.
    The third and fourth octet define the last payload.  The payloads in the

4.11 Notification Payload


The Notification Payload can contain both GSAKMP and group specific data
and is used to transmit informational data, such as error conditions, to
a GSAKMP peer.  It is possible to send multiple Notification payloads in
a single GSAKMP message.  Figure 12 shows the format of the Notification
Payload.

The Notification Payload fields are defined as follows:



Next Payload (1 octet)  - Identifier for the payload type of the next
    payload in the message.  If the current payload is the last in the
    message, then this field will be 0.

RESERVED (1 octet)  - Unused, set to 0.

Payload Length (2 octets)  - Length in octets of the current payload,
    including the generic payload header.

Notify Message Type (2 octets)  - Specifies the type of notification
    message.

Status Type (1 octet)  - Specifies the status of group with respect to
    originator of notification.

Notification Data (variable length)  - Informational or error data
    transmitted in addition to the Notify Message Type.  Values for this
    field are Domain of Interpretation (DOI)-specific.


The payload type for the Notification Payload is nine (9).

4.11.1 Notify Message Types


Notification information specifies status data and can be used by a process
managing a SA database to communicate with a peer process.  For example,
a secure front end or security gateway may use the Notify message to
synchronize SA communication.  Table 17 and Table 18 list the Notification
Messages and their corresponding values.

                    Reserved (future use)        4-255


4.12 Vendor ID Payload


The Vendor ID Payload contains a vendor defined constant.  The constant
is used by vendors to identify and recognize remote instances of their
implementations.  This mechanism allows a vendor to experiment with new
features while maintaining backwards compatibility.  This is not a general
extension facility of GSAKMP. Figure 13 shows the format of the Vendor ID
Payload.

The Vendor ID payload is not an announcement from the sender that it
will send private payload types.  A vendor sending the Vendor ID MUST
NOT make any assumptions about private payloads that it may send unless
a Vendor ID is received as well.  Multiple Vendor ID payloads MAY be
sent.  An implementation is NOT REQUIRED to understand any Vendor ID
payloads.  An implementation is NOT REQUIRED to send any Vendor ID payload
at all.  If a private payload was sent without prior agreement to send it, a
compliant implementation may reject a proposal with a notify message of type
INVALID-PAYLOAD-TYPE.

The vendor defined constant MUST be unique.  The choice of hash and text to
hash is left to the vendor to decide.  As an example, vendors could generate
their vendor id by taking a plain (non-keyed) hash of a string containing
the product name, and the version of the product.

The Vendor ID Payload fields are defined as follows:



Next Payload (1 octet)  - Identifier for the payload type of the next

6 APPENDIX A -- Rekey Packet data format


This appendix defines the format of the Rekey Event Data in the Rekey Event
Payload, when using Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) as the rekeying mechanism.

The Rekey Event Data consists of Rekey Event Header and Rekey Event Packet
Data(s).  A Packet Data is a complete set of information that an end-user
requires to be Rekeyed.  Packet Datas are comprised of new Key Packs of
types GTEK and Rekey.



6.1 Rekey Event Header


The Rekey Event Data Header contains information about the rekey data being
transmitted to the group.  Figure 16 shows the format for the header.

    Event Data was generated.

Rekey Type (1 octet)  - This is the Rekey algorithm being used for this
    group.  This value is token specific.  For this appendix, this value is
    LKH, which has a value of one (1).

    the Rekey Data.

Rekey Event Packet Data(s) (variable length)  - Contains the packets of
    rekey event information being transmitted.



6.2 Rekey Event Packet Data(s)


As defined in the Rekey Event Header, # of Rekey Packets field, multiple
pieces of information are sent in a Rekey Event Data.  Each end user, will
be interested in only one packet of the information sent.  Each Packet, will
contain all the Key Packs that a user requires.  For each Packet, the data
following the Security Header fields is encrypted with the key identified in
the Security Header.  Figure 17 shows the format of each Rekey Event Packet
with respect to LKH.

Packet Length (2 octets)  - Length in octets of the Rekey Packet, which
    consists of the # of Key Packs and the Key Pack Data(s).

Security Header:  LKH ID (2 octets)  - This is the LKH ID of the Rekey Pack
    that is being used for encryption/decryption.

Security Header:  Key Handle (4 octets)  - This is a randomly generated
    value to uniquely identify the key defined by the LKH ID.

# of Key Packs (2 octets)  - The number of key packs contained in this
    Packet Data.

                   Figure 18:  A.3:  Key Pack Data Format


Pack Type (1 octet)  - The type of key in this key pack.  Legal values are
    GTEK (0) and LKH (1).

Pack Length (2 octets)  - The length of the Pack Data.

Pack Data (variable length)  - The actual data of the key, defined by the
    key type.



6.4 Pack Data Formats


There are 2 legal values for the Pack Type, GTEK and LKH. The formats for
each Pack type are defined in this section.


6.4.1 GTEK Pack Data


This is data for the new GTEK being sent to the Rekeyed group.


Key Type (1 octet)  - This is the encryption algorithm for which this key
    data is to be used.  This value is specified in the Policy Token.

Key Creation Date (4 octets)  - This is the UNIX time value of when this
    key data was originally generated.

Key Expiration Date (4 octets)  - This is the UNIX time value of when this
    key is no longer valid for use.

Key Handle (4 octets)  - This is the randomly generated value to uniquely
    identify a key.

Key Data (variable length)  - This is the actual encryption key data, which

INTERNET-DRAFT                    GSAKM Protocol                    May 2000

    is dependant on the Key Type algorithm for its format.



6.4.2 LKH Pack Data


This is the data to fix an Group Member Rekey sequence to recover from a
compromise.


LKH ID (2 octets)  -- This is the position of this key in the binary tree
    structure used by LKH.

Key Type (1 octet)  - This is the encryption algorithm for which this key
    data is to be used.  This value is specified in the Policy Token.

Key Creation Date (4 octets)  - This is the UNIX time value of when this
    key data was originally generated.

Key Expiration Date (4 octets)  - This is the UNIX time value of when this
    key is no longer valid for use.

Key Handle (4 octets)  - This is the randomly generated value to uniquely
    identify a key.

Key Data (variable length)  - This is the actual encryption key data, which
    is dependant on the Key Type algorithm for its format.


6.5 Example


This section will give an example of the data.  The data to be transmitted
is:

| GroupID | Date/Time | Rekey Type | Algorithm Ver | # of Packets|
{ (GTEK)A, (GTEK, B, E)6, (GTEK, B)F }

This data shows that three packets are being transmitted.  Read each
packet as:
a) GTEK wrapped in LKH key A
b) GTEK, LKH keys B & E, all wrapped in LKH key 6
c) GTEK and LKH key B, all wrapped in LKH key F

We will show format for all header data, and packet (b).
