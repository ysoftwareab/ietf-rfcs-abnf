Abstract
   This Internet draft enhances cellular-IP mobility protocol with a
   Context Transfer mechanism aiming to further optimise the handoff 
   operation in mobile networks. During the handoff operation from one
   cellular-IP base station to another, cellular-IP packets could be
   used to initiate and transfer authorised context from the previous
   cellular-IP base station via the cellular-IP gateway(s) to the new
   cellular-IP base station. This draft presents how the context
   transfer extensions introduced could facilitate in reducing latency
   and packet loss by avoiding the signalling required between the 
   mobile node and the new base station in re-establishing the desired
   state information.

1. Introduction

   The cellular-IP protocol has been designed to provide local mobility
   and handoff support for frequently moving mobile hosts. Cellular IP 
   can interwork with other mobility protocols like Mobile IP [8] and
   SIP [9] to support wide area mobility. During or immediately after
   handoff, packet losses may occur due to delayed propagation of the
   new location information.

   The aim of cellular-IP is to minimize these packet losses in order to
   avoid a degradation of service quality as handoffs become more
   frequent.

   When a mobile host moves to a new base station it also needs to
   establish certain context transfer candidate services that have 
   already been established at the previous base station and left 
   behind.  Such services include header compression, multicast group 
   membership number, QoS policy, AAA profile and IPsec state. Re-
   establishing these services at the new base station will require a 
   considerable amount of time for the protocol exchanges and as a
   result time-sensitive real-time traffic will suffer during this time.
   On the contrary preserving the context of the IP flows can contribute
   towards the seamless operation of the handoff.

   The extensions to cellular-IP proposed in this draft are to offer
   extra functionality for forwarding the desired state information at
   the new base station. This context transfer mechanism will
   result in quick re-establishment of context transfer-candidate
   services at the new base station and interoperability with any layer
   two radio access technology [1]. It would contribute to the seamless 
   operation of application streams and would reduce susceptibility to 
   errors. Re-initiation of services to and from the mobile node will be
   avoided and hence latency will be reduced.

2. Cellular-IP protocol extensions

   Within a cellular-IP domain, during a handover from one BS to 
   another, cellular-IP control packets could be used to initiate
   and transfer authorised context from the CIP-GW to the NBS. The 
   context information will be stored at the CIP-GW and a copy of this 
   context (state information) will be forwarded to the NBS. 

   One of the main advantages of using cellular-IP is the distinction it
   makes between idle and active users.  This separation allows the 
   network to follow a mobile node in active state from BS to BS and
   deliver packets without searching for the mobile host.  By separating
   the caches for active and idle mobile hosts only a smaller cache
   needs to be searched for most of the packets which results in faster
   lookups and better scalability [6]. This CIP advantage of separating
   active hosts from idle mobile hosts is also a benefit to the context
   transfer mechanism since it also targets active mobile hosts. 

   In order to incorporate this context transfer mechanism in the
   cellular-IP protocol the following enhancements are required:

   * Introduction of a Context-Update (CU) packet
   * Introduction of Context cache at each cellular-IP leaf node.
   * Re-configure  the cellular-IP Route-Update packet.
   For inter-domain handoff:
   * Introduction of a Context-Update request (CU-Req) packet
   * Introduction of a Context-Update reply (CU-Rep) packet

   In what follows, we present a description of each of these   extensions.

2.1 Context-update packet

   Similarly to the Route update and paging update packets defined in
   [6] the context update packet will also be an ICMP packet.  The basic
   format of an ICMP packet is shown below:

                              ICMP packet format

   For the context update packet the source address will be the address
   of the CIP-GW and the destination address will be the NBS address.  
   The type is a Cellular IP control packet and the code is context-
   update.  The payload of the context update packet carries 
   authentication information in the same format as the route and paging
   update packets but carries control information in a different 
   format.  The payload of the context-update packet carries 
   authentication and control information in the following format [6].

   Timestamp   Contains a timestamp used to determine the order in which
               update packets are sent. The timestamp field is formatted
               as specified by the Network Time Protocol [7].

   CU          Currently Unused. Must be set to 0.

   S flag      Set to 1 to indicate semi-soft handoff. Default value is
               0. Any Cellular IP node that does not support semi-soft 
               handoffs may ignore this bit.

   Atype       Denotes the authentication method used. The default 
               authentication is described in [10]. All authentication 
               methods must utilize the timestamp field.

   Auth. Length   
               Denotes the length of the authentication information in
               bytes.

   Authentication Contains the authentication information.

   Alternatively the Authentication Header [10] could  be used for
   authenticating control packets. This is for further study.

   Control information is encoded in the following Type-Length-Value
   format:

0                   1                   2

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-   -+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

   Context Type Indicates the type of context information.

   Length       Indicates the length (in bytes) of the following data
                field within.  The length does not include the Type and
                Length bytes.

   Context Data Contains the context information of a single context
   type.
 
2.2 Context-update Request Packet (CU-Req)

   Similarly to the context-update packet the CU-Req will also be an
   ICMP packet. The source address will be the address of the new CIP-GW
   and the destination address will be the address of the previous
   CIP-GW. The type is a Cellular IP control packet and the code is
   CU-Req. The payload of the CU-Req packet carries a list of the
   desired context information.

2.3 Context-update Reply Packet (CU-Rep)

   CU-Rep is also an ICMP packet. The source address will be the address
   of the previous CIP-GW and the destination address will be the 
   address of the new CIP-GW. The type is a Cellular IP control packet
   and the code is CU-Rep. The payload of the context update packet 
   carries the context information. 

2.4 Context Cache

   Cellular IP nodes will need to be upgraded to maintain a Context
   Cache. Context Cache will maintain context information relating to
   each of the mobile hosts attached to that BS. The operation of
   Context Cache is summarised in the following table.

2.5  Re-configuring  the Route-Update packet

   One of the currently unused (CU) bits could be used as a flag which
   when set will indicate that the route-update packet was  spawned due
   to a handoff. The payload of the ICMP packet will be 
   changed to the following:

     0                   1                   2                   3     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   is set to 1, the CIP-GW will send a context-update packet towards the
   Mobile Host.


3 Routing

3.1 Intra-domain handoff (i.e. handoff within a single Cellular-IP
    domain)

   Route-update packet transmitted by the mobile host reaches the CIP-GW
   using shortest path hop-by-hop routing. Cellular IP nodes monitor
   these passing data packets and use them to create and update Route
   Cache mappings. These map mobile host IP addresses to downlink 
   neighbours of the Cellular IP node. Packets addressed to the mobile 
   host are routed along the reverse path, on a hop-by-hop basis,
   according to these Route mappings [6]. When the route-update packet 
   reaches the CIP-GW, if the H flag of the route-update packet is set 
   to 1, the CIP-GW will send a context-update packet towards the mobile
   host. The context-update packets will be routed along the reverse 
   path on a hop-by-hop basis towards the mobile host. When the context-
   update arrives at the NBS, the NBS stores the context data in its 
   context cache and it discards the packet. 

3.2 Inter-domain handoff (i.e. Cellular-IP to Cellular-IP domain handoff)

   This is similar to the Intra-domain handoff process (section 2.5) with
   additional messages to request and forward the desired context 
   information from the previous CIP-GW to the new CIP-GW. When the 
   route-update packet reaches the new CIP-GW, if the H flag is enabled 
   and the GW identifies the MH as a newcomer to its domain, it requests
   the context information from the previous CIP-GW by sending a CU-Req
   packet. On reception of the CU-Req the previous CIP-GW forwards the
   desired context information to the new CIP-GW using a CU-Rep packet.
   The new CIP-GW in turn stores the context at the context cache and 
   creates a CU packet containing the context. The CU packet, carrying 
   the feature contexts, will be routed along the reverse path on a hop-
   by-hop basis towards the mobile node. When the context update arrives
   at the NBS the NBS stores the context data in its context cache and
   discards the packet.

3.3 Basic handoff procedure

   Handoff is initiated from the mobile host by sending a route-update 
   packet towards the cellular-IP gateway. When an active host 
   approaches a new BS, it transmits a route-update packet and redirects
   its packets from the PBS to the NBS. The route-update packet will 
   configure Route Caches along the way from the NBS to the CIP-GW. In 
   most cases the paths leading to the PBS and NBS may overlap.  In 
   nodes where the two paths coincide, the route-update packet simply 
   refreshes the old mapping and the handoff remains unnoticed.

                       MH  ---> [MH]

   Whether the context transfer procedure takes place during or after
   the handoff procedure, will depend on whether the cellular-IP handoff
   used, was "semi-soft" or not.  

3.4 Semi-soft handoff

   One of the extensions proposed in [6] aims to improve the performance
   of loss sensitive applications by introducing another type of handoff
   called "semi-soft" handoff.  The handoff procedure described in 3.3 
   is known as "hard" handoff and is where the mobile host switches from
   the PBS to the NBS all at once.  With "semi-soft" handoff the mobile 
   host maintains communication with the PBS while establishing 
   connection with the NBS.  Packets intended to the mobile host are 
   sent to both Base Stations, so when the mobile host eventually 
   handoffs it continues to receive packets without interruption [6].  
   The mobile host initiates the semi-soft handoff by sending a route-
   update packet with the S flag set to 1 towards the CIP-GW via the NBS
   while continuing to listen to the PBS.

   This handoff procedure will not only result in a smoother change over
   between base stations but it is also favoured by the context transfer
   extension since it provides us with a context transfer trigger 
   (route-update packet) prior to handoff. If the context transfer 
   procedure completes before the mobile node attaches to the NBS, the 
   NBS will have a copy of the desired state information prior to 
   handoff and consequently this will be the ideal case.

4. Trigger Considerations

   Knowing when to initiate context transfer is very important in order 
   to get the timing right and forward the context seamlessly with the 
   handoff. Trigger signals are thus crucial in achieving exactly this. 
   As mentioned in [1] the context transfer solution must define the
   characteristics of these trigger mechanisms used to initiate context 
   transfer.

   As mentioned earlier in this  draft the  re-configured Route-Update 
   message will be the trigger used at the Cellular-IP gateway to 
   initiate Context Transfer from the Cellular-IP gateway to the new 
   base station . When the route-update packet is received by the CIP-
   GW, if the H flag is set to 1, the CIP-GW will initiate context 
   transfer. In the case of an intra-domain handoff the CIP-GW will send
   a context update packet to the NBS (see section 3.1). In the case of
   an inter-domain handoff the CIP-GW will request for a copy of the 
   context from the previous CIP-GW prior to sending a send a context-
   update packet to the NBS.

5. Timing Considerations

   The addition of the context transfer mechanism to the cellular-IP 
   protocol should not add any disruption to the loss prone services.


6. Transport Consideration

   In this Internet draft, we have proposed an extra packet  to the  
   cellular-IP protocol, the context-update packet, which will be used
   as a carrier to forward a copy of the context information from the
   PBS via the CIP-GW to the NBS. The context update packet proposed is
   an ICMP packet. 


7. Zone of Operation

   Since the context transfer mechanism proposed in this  draft is an
   extension to the cellular-IP protocol the zone of operation will
   depend entirely on the coverage of cellular-IP. Although cellular-IP 
   was intended to provide mobility and handoff support locally the 
   context transfer extensions proposed in this draft provide both intra
   -domain (see section 3.1) and inter-domain (see section 3.2) handoff
   support.

8. Security Issues

   As with the rest of the cellular-IP control packets the context-
   update packets will carry mandatory authentication information.  

   In general since the context transfer extension proposed in this 
   draft is an extension to the cellular-IP protocol the security 
   proposed for cellular-IP [6] covers the security requirements for a 
   context transfer mechanism [1][2]. This will avoid the need of using 
   security mechanism such as IPsec and TLS which will create additional
   overhead on the header.
