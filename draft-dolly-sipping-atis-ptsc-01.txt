Internet-Draft           ATIS PTSC Work Program                July 2005


1.  Introduction

   At the 64th Vancouver IETF Meeting it is anticipated that discussions
   will occur regarding the developed Area Description for a Real Time
   Applications and Infrastructure Area, to be developed by the
   Transport and Applications ADs and the WG Chairs involved for
   discussion with the community.  This Internet Draft has been prepared
   to share the relevant portions of the PTSC current work program with
   the IETF.  It is hoped that awareness of the Packet Technologies
   Systems Committee (PTSC) work program will allow for more informed
   discussions to occur.

   The PTSC defines its work program in the context of Issues.  The PTSC
   operates on the principle that one deliverable is typically produced
   under one identified Issue (or project if you wish).  It is important
   to understand that the PTSC is quite prepared to recommend adoption
   of existing standards should they be available and appropriate.

   The PTSC wishes to maintain a good working relationship with the IETF
   and sees the IETF as a rich potential source of IP related protocols.


2.  PTSC Work Program

   The PTSC is an ATIS sponsored technical committee.  The PTSC develops
   and recommends standards and Technical Reports related to packet
   based services, architectures, and signaling, in addition to working
   with related subjects under consideration in other North American and
   international standards bodies.  The PTSC is a major source of
   proposed United States Positions to the ITU.

   While the full PTSC work program is publicly available and can be
   found at: http://www.atis.org/0191/issues.asp, this document will
   identify those items that are related to this topical area and that
   are active.

2.1.  IP Interconnection, and Services & Capabilities

   The following issue statements cover the topics related to general
   network interconnection:

   Issue S0009 - Authorizes development of a standard that defines the
      NNI interface to promote IP-IP interconnection between carriers in
      support of multi-media services.
