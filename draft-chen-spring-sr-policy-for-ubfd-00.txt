       Segment Routing Policy for Unaffiliated BFD Echo Function
                draft-chen-spring-sr-policy-for-ubfd-00

Abstract

   This document describes how to leverage Segment Routing (SR) Policy
   to make sure that the Unaffiliated BFD (U-BFD) Echo packets must be
   transmitted to the remote system before being looped back to the
   local system.  This enables that U-BFD works not only for one hop
   scenario but for multiple hops scenario as well.

   In addition, this document also defines a way to explicitly specify
   the loop back path of the Echo packets.  This is useful in the case
   where the forward and reverse path of the Echo packets are required
   to follow the same path.

1.  Introduction

   BFD Echo function was originally defined in [RFC5880] and [RFC5881],
   where the remote system is required to loop the BFD Echo packets back
   to the local system.  To support BFD Echo Function, some negotiations
   between the local system and remote system are needed, and both the
   local and remote system need to maintain the BFD session state.

   Unaffiliated BFD Echo Function (U-BFD) is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-unaffiliated-echo].  Where the destination IP address
   of the BFD Echo packets is set to one of the IP addresses of the
   local system.  Therefore, the Echo packets can be automatically
   looped back (through normal IP forwarding) by the remote system to
   the local system.  With U-BFD, the remote system does not need to
   support any BFD related functions and maintain any session states.
   This further simplifies the BFD Echo Function process at the remote
   system hence increases the saleability.

   But, the U-BFD works when there is only one hop between the local
   system and remote system.  Otherwise, the Echo packets will be

   prematurely looped back by an intermediate node to the local system,
   therefore the Echo packets will not be transmitted to the remote
   system.  This may result in false negative issue.  Take the following
   figure (Figure 1) as an example, if the U-BFD is expected to monitor
   the path between node A and node C, node A (as the local system) sets
   the destination IP to itself and sends the Echo packets to node B.
   Since node B has the route to node A, the Echo packets will be
   directly forwarded back to node A.  If there is a failure on the path
   between node B and node C, obviously, the U-BFD session cannot detect
   it.

            +-+        +-+         +-+

           Figure 1, Multi-hop Scenario

   In addition, in some scenarios, for example, mobile backhaul network,
   where the forward and reverse direction of a path are required to
   along the same path.  When apply BFD in mobile backhaul network, it
   also expects that the BFD control packets in both directions follow
   the same path, otherwise, it may result in false positive issue.
   Take the following figure (Figure 2) as an example, there are two
   paths (A-B-C, A-D-C) between node A and node C.  Assuming that it
   expects to monitor the path A-B-C by using BFD, where node A is the
   local system and node C is the remote system.  If node C chooses path
   C-D-A to send the control packets, when a failure occurs on path
   C-D-A, node A (the local system) will not receive the BFD packets and
   hence consider that path A-B-C is failed.  But actually path A-B-C is
   working.

   To solve the above issues, there needs a way to make sure that U-BFD
   Echo packets must be transmitted to the remote system before being
   looped back.  And when looping back the U-BFD Echo packets, the
   remote system should send the U-BFD Echo packets along a specified
   path.

   Since Segment Routing (SR) Policy
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] allows a headend node to
   steer a packet flow along any path.  This document leverages the SR

   policy to make sure that the U-BFD Echo packets must be transmitted
   to the remote system before being looped back.  This enables that
   U-BFD Echo Function works not only for one hop scenario but for
   multiple hops scenario.  By using SR policy, the loop back path of
   the Echo packets can be specified as well.  This is useful in the
   case where the forward and loop back path of the Echo packets are
   required to follow the same path.

2.  SR Policy for U-BFD

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy], an SR Policy
   is identified through the tuple <headend, color, endpoint>.  To
   support U-BFD, the endpoint of the Policy MUST be set to the same as
   the headend that is specified as an IPv4 or IPv6 address of the
   headend node.  To make sure that the U-BFD Echo packets must be
   transmitted to the remote system, the SR Policy MUST have a candidate
   path that is associated with a Segment-List.  The Segment-List MUST
   include a SID that identifies the remote system.  To specify the loop
   back path, a series of SIDs or a Binding SID (BSID) that is
   associated with the loop back path MUST be included in the Segment-
   List.

   Based on the topology in Figure 2, below are some examples that show
   how the SR Polices for U-BFD can be instantiated at the headend node.

   1.  The forward direction forwarding is based on the SR Policy, the
       loop back direction forwarding is based on IP forwarding.  This
       way, only the SIDs of the forward path should be included in the
       Segment-List, and at least the SID of the remote system should be
       included.  The SR Policy will make sure that the U-BFD Echo
       packets are transmitted to the remote system.  When receives the
       Echo packets, the remote system will decapsulate the Echo packets
       and then forward them back to the local system according to IP
       forwarding.

     SR policy POL1 <headend = A, color = 1, endpoint = A>
       Candidate-path CP1 <protocol-origin = 20, originator =
                           100:1.1.1.1, discriminator = 1>
         Preference 200
         Weight W1,
         SID-List <B,C>

   2.  Both the forward and loop back direction forwarding are based on
       the SR Policy.  A BSID (carried in the Segment-List) is used to
       identify the loop back path <B, A>.  Using BSID can decrease the
       SID stack depth.

     SR policy POL2 <headend = A, color = 1, endpoint = A>
       Candidate-path CP1 <protocol-origin = 20, originator =
                           100:1.1.1.1, discriminator = 2>
         Preference 200
         Weight W1,
         SID-List <B, C, BSID>

   3.  Both the forward and loop back direction forwarding are based on
       the SR Policy.  The forward path <B, C> and loop back path <B, A>
       are explicitly included in the Segment-List.  This is suitable
       for the case where the hops of forward and loop back path are not
       too much, the ingress (local system) has the capability to handle
       the whole SIDs of the forward and loop back path.

     SR policy POL2 <headend = A, color = 1, endpoint = A>
       Candidate-path CP1 <protocol-origin = 20, originator =
                           100:1.1.1.1, discriminator = 3>

         Weight W1,
