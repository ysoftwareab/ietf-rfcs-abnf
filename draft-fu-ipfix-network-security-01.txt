   IPFIX Information Elements for inspecting network security issues
                   draft-fu-ipfix-network-security-01

Abstract

   IPFIX protocol has been used to carry Information Elements, which are
   defined to measure the traffic information and information related to
   the traffic observation point, traffic metering process and the
   exporting process.  Network or device status are checked through
   analysing neccessary observed information.  Although most of the
   existing Information Elements are useful for network security
   inspection, they are still not sufficient to determine the reasons
   behind observed events such as for DDOS attack, ICMP attack, and
   fragment attack.  To allow administrators making effective and quick
   response to the attacks, this document extends the standard
   Information Elements and describes the formats for inspecting network
   security.

1.  Terminology

   IPFIX-specific terminology (Information Element, Template, Template
   Record, Options Template Record, Template Set, Collector, Exporter,
   Data Record, etc.) used in this document is defined in Section 2 of
   [RFC7011].  As in [RFC7011], these IPFIX-specific terms have the
   first letter of a word capitalized.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft       IPFIX IEs for network security           April 2015


2.  Introduction

   As network security issues arising dramatically nowadays, network
   administrators are eager to detect and identify attacks as early as
   possible, generate countermeasurements with high agility.  Due to the
   enormous amount of network attack types, metrics useful for attack
   detection are as diverse as attack patterns themselves.  Moreover,
   attacking methods are evolved rapidly, which brings challenges to
   designing detect mechanism.

   The IPFIX requirement [RFC3917] points out that one of the target
   applications of IPFIX is atack and intrusion detection.  The IPFIX
   Protocol [RFC7011] defines a generic exchange mechanism for flow
   information and events.  It supports source-triggered exporting of
   information due to the push model approach other than exporting upon
   flow-end or fixed time intervals.The IPFIX Information Model
   [RFC5102] defines a list of standard Information Elements (IEs) which
   can be carried by the IPFIX protocol.  Eventhough the existing
   standard IEs are useful to check the status/events of the traffic,
   they are not sufficient to help network administrators identify
   categories of the attacks.  The scanty information will result in an
   inaccurate analysis and slowing down the effective response towards
   network attacks.

   For instance, CC (Challenge Collapsar) attack is a typical
   application layer DDoS attack, which mainly attacks the dynamic pages
   of web server.  It makes the web server's resources exhausted and
   paralyzed, so the server will be denial of service.  Because CC
   attacker imitates normal users' behavior pretty well by using
   different real IP addresses with relatively completive access process
   (even with low speed), it makes the attack concealed well compared
   with traditional network layer DDoS (e.g.  SYN-Flood, etc).  In
   addition, the attacker often manipulates the attack behind the scenes
   by non-direct communicate with target server, so the attack is not
   easy to be tracked and discovered.  It would be useful to collect
   application status information for application layer attacks.  In
   this case, CC attack is likely to happen if a large number of non 2XX
   HTTP status code replied from the server are observed.

   Fragment attack employs unexpected formats of fragmentation, which
   will result in errors such as fragmentation buffer full, fragment
   overlapped, fragment incomplete.  Existing IPFIX fragmentation
   metrics includes fragmentOffset, fragmentIdentification,
   fragmentFlags, which only indicate the attributes of a single
   fragment, and are not suitable for attack detection.  Integrated
   measurements are needed to provide an holistic review of the session.
   Furthermore ICMP flow model has features such as the ICMP Echo/Echo
   Reply dominate the whole traffic flow, ICMP packet interval is

   usually not too short (normally 1 pkt/s).  The current ICMP
   information elements of IPFIX contains the ICMP type and code for
   both IPv4 and IPv6, however they are for a single ICMP packet rather
   than statistical property of the ICMP session.  Further metrics like
   the cumulated sum of various counters should be calculated based on
   sampling method defined by the Packet SAMPling (PSAMP) protocol [RFC
   5477].  Similar problems occur in TCP, UDP, SNMP and DNS attack, it
   would be useful to derive the number of the upstream and downstream
   packets separately and over time in order to detect the anomalies of
   the network.

   Upon the above discussions and per IPFIX applicability [RFC 5472],
   derived metrics are useful to provide sufficient evidence about
   security incident.  A wisely chosen sets of derived metrics will
   allow direct exporting with minimal resource consumption.  This
   document extends the IPFIX Information model and defines Information
   Elements (IEs) that SHOULD be used to identify different attack
   categories, the standardization of those IEs will improve the network
   security and will support the offline analysis of data from different
   operators in the future.

3.  Information Elements and use cases

   This section presents the information elements that are useful for
   attack detection, the IPFIX templates could contain a subset of the
   Information Elements(IEs) shown in Table 1 depending upon the attack
   under concern of the network administrator.  For example a session
   creation template contains

   {sourceIPv4Address, destinationIpv4Address, sourceTransportPort,
   destinationTransportPort, protocolIdentifier, pktUpstreamCount,
   pktDownstreamCount, selectorAlgorithm, samplingPacketInterval,
   samplingPacketSpace}

   An example of the actual event data record is shown below in a
   readable form

   {192.168.0.201, 192.168.0.1, 51132, 80, 7, 67, 87, 3, 100,1000}

3.1.  Information Elements

   The following is the table of all the IEs that a device would need to
   export for attack statistic analysis.  The formats of the IEs and the
   IPFIX IDs are listed below.  Most of the IEs are defined in [IPFIX-
   IANA], while some of the IPFIX IE's ID are not assigned yet, and
   hence the detailed explanation of these fields are presented in the
   following sections.  The recommended registrations to IANA is
   described the IANA considerations section.

                    Table 1: Information Element table

3.2.  Packet upstream/downstream counters

   A sudden increase of Flow from different sources to one destination
   may be caused by an attack on a specific host or network node using
   spoofed addresses.  However it may be cased by legitimate users who
   seek access to a recently published web content.  Only reporting the
   total packet number is not sufficient to indicate whether attacks
   occur, as it lacks details to separate good packets from abnormoal
   packets. as a result, upstream and downstream packets should be
   monitored seperately so that upstream to downstream packet number
   ratio can be use to detect successful connections. pktUpstreamCount
   and pktDownstreamCount are added to IPFIX to represent the cumulated
   upstream and downstream packet number respectively.

3.3.  ICMP echo/echo reply counters

   An unusual ratio of ICMP echo to ICMP echo reply packets can refer to
   ICMP attack.  However the existing set of IPFIX IEs provides the type
   and code of ICMP packet, countinuously export the information will
   result in serious resource consumption at the exporter, the collector
   and the bandwith.  The number of echo and echo reply packets in a
   Flow can be derived for the Observation Domain in a specific time
   interval or once the ratio exceeds threshold.  The basic metrics
   icmpEchoCount and icmpEchoReplyCount are defined as new IPFIX
   Information Elements.

3.4.  Fragment statistic

   Typical fragment attack includes fragmentation buffer full, fragment
   overlapped, fragment incomplete.  Existing IPFIX fragmentation
   metrics includes fragmentIdentification,fragmentOffset,
   fragmentFlags, which are not sufficient to identify errors, and are
   not suitable for early attack detection.  Integrated measurements are
   needed to provide an holistic review of the flow.
   fragmentIncompleteCount checks the number of incomplete fragmentation
   ,fragmentFirstTooShortCount verifies the number of fragments with
   first fragment too short, fragmentOffsetErrorCount checks the number
   of fragments with offset error, and fragmentFlagErrorCount detect
   early whether the fragmentation is caused by a malicious attack.

3.5.  Application error code

   The application layer attack requires IPFIX protocol capture packet
   payload.  An initial consideration of the application error code
   comes from the HTTP status code except 2XX successful code.  Other
   application layer protocol error code are also supported.  The error
   code list can be expanded in the future as necessary.  The data
   record will have the corresponding error code value to identify the
   error that is being logged.

3.6.  Extended value of FlowEndReason

   There are 5 defined reasons for Flow termination, with values ranging
   from 0x01 to 0x05:

   0x01: idle timeout

   0x02: active timeout

   0x03: end of Flow detected

   0x04: forced end

   0x05: lack of resources

   There is an additional reason caused by state machine anomaly.  When
   FIN/SYN is sent, but no ACK is replied after a waiting timeout, the
   existing five reasons do not match this case.Therefore, a new value
   is proposed to extend the FlowEndReason, which is 0x06: protocol
   exception timeout.

4.  Encoding

4.1.  IPFIX

   This document uses IPFIX as the encoding mechanism to monitor
   security events.  However, the information that is logged SHOULD be
   the same irrespective of what kind of encoding scheme is used.  IPFIX
   is chosen, because it is an IETF standard that meets all the needs
   for a reliable logging mechanism and one of its targets are for
   security applications.  IPFIX provides the flexibility to the logging
   device to define the data sets that it is logging.  The IEs specified
   for logging MUST be the same irrespective of the encoding mechanism
   used.
