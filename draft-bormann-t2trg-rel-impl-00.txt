     impl-info: A link relation type for disclosing implementation
                              information
                    draft-bormann-t2trg-rel-impl-00

Abstract

   When debugging an interoperability problem, it is often helpful to
   have information about the implementation version of a peer.  To
   enable the disclosure of such information, HTTP defines header fields
   such as Server and User-Agent.

   In CoAP, it is rarely appropriate to send information of this kind in
   every request or response.  Instead, the present specification
   defines a link relation type, impl-info, that can be used to convey
   this information via the self-description capabilities of the /.well-
   known/core resource and the CoRE resource directory.

1.  Introduction

   (TO DO: Insert an extended form of the abstract first here, expanding
   the references to [RFC7231], [RFC7252], [RFC6690], and
   [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory] in the process.)

2.  IANA Consideration

   This specification requests the registration of the link relation
   type "impl-info".

   The registration template as per [RFC8288] follows.

   o  _Relation Name_: impl-info

   o  _Description_: Refers to implementation information that may be
      helpful in diagnosing technical problems with the implementation
      of the context, such as lists of components and their
      implementation versions.

   o  _Reference_: [THIS]

3.  Security considerations

   The security considerations listed in Section 9.6 of [RFC7231] and
   the sections referenced there apply.

Acknowledgements

   The need for implementation information in the CoRE resource
   directory has been identified by Peter van der Stok.  Discussions
   with Peter and with Christian Amsuess led to the present proposal of
   employing self-description for this purpose.
