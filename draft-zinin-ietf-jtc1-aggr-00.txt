INTERNET DRAFT       IETF - JTC1 Aggreement on IS-IS        October 2002


Document Header

   Title: Draft Addendum 1 (to Cooperative Agreement Between the
   Internet Society and the International Organization for
   Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission / Joint
   Technical Committee 1 / Sub Committee 6 (ISO/IEC JTC1/SC6): IS-IS
   Routing Protocols

   Date:  XXXX

   This addendum records the agreed collaborative process for the
   further development and standardisation of the Intermediate System to
   Intermediate System (IS-IS) intra-domain routing protocol (ISO/IEC
   10589).

1. Introduction

   The IS-IS intra-domain routing protocols, originally developed in
   ISO/IEC/JTC1/SC6, have been successfully deployed in the Internet for
   several years.

   ISO/IEC/JTC1/SC6 is the JTC1 sub-committee which has responsibility
   for maintenance of the IS-IS standard (ISO/IEC 10589).

   The IS-IS Working Group of the IETF is chartered to develop
   extensions to the IS-IS protocol to be used within the scope of the
   Internet.

   This addendum documents the agreed process for the future development
   of IS-IS by both organisations.

2. Definitions

 2.1 Core IS-IS Mechanisms

   Core IS-S Mechanisms are subsystems with associated algorithms, data
   structures, and PDU formats as specified in (ISO/IEC 10589),
   constituting the core of the IS-IS protocol and including the
   following elements:


     a)   Framework of PDU formats, including standard TLVs

     b)   Encapsulation of PDUs

     c)   Adjacency state machine and formation logic





Zinin                                                           [Page 2]





INTERNET DRAFT       IETF - JTC1 Aggreement on IS-IS        October 2002


     d)   DIS election algorithm

     e)   Initial LSP synchronization via CSNP exchange

     f)   Asynchronous LSP flooding (including DIS flooding behavior)

     g)   LSP database maintenance including LSP origination, aging, and
          purging

     h)   Standard topology abstraction

 2.2 Internet-specific IS-IS Extensions:

   Internet-specific IS-IS Extensions are extensions to the IS-IS proto-
   col that are within the work scope of the IETF (including, but not
   limited to IPv4 or IPv6 unicast and multicast routing, MPLS, MPLS TE,
   GMPLS, or any other routing technology that the IETF decides to work
   on in future), and:

     a)   do not modify the Core IS-IS Mechanisms and do not change
          operation of non-IP or affect compatibility with non-IP and
          dual implementations of IS-IS, or

     b)   add supplementary mechanisms to the Core IS-IS Mechanisms, are
          not generally applicable to non-IP implementations of IS-IS,
          and do not change operation of non-IP or affect compatibility
          with non-IP and dual implementations of IS-IS, or

     c)   are de facto implementation agreements that are not generally
          applicable to non-IP implementations of IS-IS.

   Note that in the text above introduction of new TLVs or sub-TLVs
   without modifying the algorithms of the Core Mechanisms in a way
   affecting interoperability with non-IP or dual implementations of IS-
   IS is not considered to be a modification to the Core IS-IS Mecha-
   nisms.

3. Agreement

   The following conventions are used in the rest of this document.

     SHALL      This term is used to indicate commitment to follow
                a specific element of this agreement.

     MUST       Equivalent to "SHALL"

     SHALL NOT  This phrase is used to indicate commitment to NOT
                perform a specific action



Zinin                                                           [Page 3]





INTERNET DRAFT       IETF - JTC1 Aggreement on IS-IS        October 2002


     MAY        This term is used to indicate the right to perform a
                specific action

     SHOULD     This term is used to indicate that following a specific
                element of this agreement is encouraged, however there
                may exist circumstances in which a decision may be made
                not to do so.

 3.1 Separation of IS-IS Work Scope

   JTC1 SHALL NOT and IETF MAY (subject to the IETF standards process)
   standardize any Internet-specific IS-IS Extensions.

   Any IS-IS Extensions produced within the IETF that require standard-
   ization, but cannot be identified as Internet-specific per section
   2.2 of this document SHOULD be submitted for standardization to JTC1
   (see section 3.3.2). IETF SHALL NOT publish documents describing such
   IS-IS extensions other than as Informational RFCs.

   IS-IS extensions submitted from the IETF to JTC1 will be processed
   under the JTC1 fast track procedure. To ensure the quality of such
   submissions, IETF SHALL apply to them the procedures for Proposed
   Standard submission according to [RFC2026] (even though these docu-
   ments will not be published as standards-track IETF RFCs).

 3.1 Requirements for IS-IS-specific IETF documents

   All IS-IS-related IETF draft documents intended to be published as
   IETF standards track RFCs MUST include a section explaining why they
   qualify to be considered as Internet-specific IS-IS Extensions
   described in section 2.2 of this document.

 3.2 IS-IS Registries (IANA Considerations)

  3.2.1 IS-IS TLV Codepoint Registry

   Until JTC1 provides the registry service for IS-IS, IANA is requested
   to temporarily maintain such a registry as described below. Upon
   notification from JTC1, the registry management authority (i.e.,
   value allocation) will be transferred to JTC1. IANA MAY still retain
   the registry for informational purposes and keep updating it based on
   information provided by JTC1.

   IANA is requested to create and maintain a registry for IS-IS TLV
   codepoints. The range of values is 0-255. Initial state of the reg-
   istry should be synchronized with [ISIS-TLVS]. Allocation of values
   in the registry has to be approved by the designated expert assigned
   by the IESG. IETF SHALL keep JTC1/SC6 informed of TLV codepoint



Zinin                                                           [Page 4]





INTERNET DRAFT       IETF - JTC1 Aggreement on IS-IS        October 2002


   values allocated, and JTC1/SC6 SHALL refer allocation requests aris-
   ing within JTC1 constituencies to the IANA registry process.

  3.2.2 IETF-specific Registries

   IETF MAY request IANA to maintain IS-IS-related registries if those
   are required to maintain name spaces internal to Internet-specific
   IS-IS extensions.

 3.3 Collaboration Guidelines

  3.3.1 Learning About New Work

   IETF SHALL inform the chairman and secretariat of ISO JTC 1/SC 6
   about new IS-IS-related work items.

   JTC1/SC6 SHALL inform the IETF Routing Area directors and ISIS WG
   chairs about new IS-IS-related work items.

   Communication MAY be enacted directly using electronic mail, or may
   be conducted via appointed SC6 / IETF liaison representatives.

  3.3.2 Submitting IETF Documents to JTC1

   As a class A liaison organisation to JTC1, the Internet Society may
   submit existing standards for adoption as International Standards of
   the ISO, using the Fast-Track procedure.

   IS-IS extensions developed by IETF and intended for standardization
   in JTC1 according to section 3.1 SHOULD therefore be submitted by one
   of the IETF ISIS WG chairs, or an IETF Routing Area director, sending
   an e-mail message to the secretariat of ISO JTC 1 specifying the num-
   ber of the Informational RFC containing the specification (the docu-
   ment MUST have been published as an RFC at the time of submission)
   and requesting fast-track processing by JTC1. The full text of the
   specification is then available using the following URL:

     http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfcNNNN.txt

   where "NNNN" is the number of the RFC being submitted. The IETF
   SHOULD also recommend that JTC1 assign the document to JTC1/SC6, and
   SHOULD also submit to JTC1 the name of an individual who is prepared
   to serve as project editor for the fast-track document.

  3.3.3 Submitting JTC1 Documents to IETF

   It is possible to make JTC1 standards specifications available for
   informational purposes of the IETF community by submitting the text



Zinin                                                           [Page 5]





INTERNET DRAFT       IETF - JTC1 Aggreement on IS-IS        October 2002


   of the specification as an Internet Draft and requesting the RFC Edi-
   tor to publish the document as an Informational RFC. See sections
   4.2.2 and 7 of [RFC2026] for more information. Guidelines for Inter-
   net Draft preparation are given in [ID-GUIDE].

  3.3.4 Mutual Document Review

   Members of ISO JTC 1/SC 6 are welcome to review any IS-IS-related
   IETF document (all IETF documents are publicly available at the IETF
   web site) and submit their comments to the ISIS WG (by sending an e-
   mail to the working group mailing list), the ISIS WG chairs, the IETF
   Routing Area directors, or the IESG (iesg@ietf.org).

   JTC1 is encouraged to request an IETF review of IS-IS-related work
   performed by JTC 1/SC 6 by submitting the text of the document as an
   informational Internet Draft (see section 3.3.2) and sending a mes-
   sage to the IETF ISIS WG mailing list requesting the comments.
