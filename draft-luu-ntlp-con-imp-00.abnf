SM=0: when an intermediate NSIS-aware node receives this
                    message, it MUST not entirely examine the message.
                    It SHOULD check the Integrity object to assure the
                    hop by hop security. The message is forwarded
                    without establishing state. SM=0 can be used for
                    directly sending a signaling message between two
                    NEs without interference of intermediate nodes
                    except assuring the hop by hop security.

SM=1: when an intermediate NTLP node receives this
                    message, NTLP MUST entirely examine the message. If
                    the state is not yet established, it must establish
                    a state for this new session. SM=1 can be used for
                    the signaling applications which need to establish
                    a state on all NTLP-aware nodes on the signalling
                    path.

SM=2: If an intermediate node that supports a specific
                    NSLP receives this message, NTLP MUST entirely
                    examine the message.  If the state is not yet
                    established, it must establish the state of this
                    new session. SM=2 can be used for signalling
                    applications that only need to establish state on

                    the NSLP-aware nodes.

SM=3: If an intermediate node of a specific NSLP-aware
                    receives this message, NTLP MUST entirely examine
                    the message.  If the state is not yet established,
                    NTLP MUST wait the decision of NSLP to know whether
                    the state must be established. If the node is not a
                    specific NSLP-aware, NTLP MUST not examine the
                    entire message. It can check the Integrity object
                    to assure the hop by hop security.

D=0: the direction of the NSLP message is the same as
                       data flow direction

D=1: the direction of the NSLP message is in the
                       opposite direction of data flow

B=0: session from NI to NR.

B=1: session from NR to NI. 


D=0 : the direction of the NSLP message is the same as

D=1 : the direction of the NSLP message is in the opposite
                    direction of data flow

B=0: session from NI (NSIS initiator) to NR (NSIS

SM=1 : NTLP state MUST be established on all NTLP-aware
                     nodes. Note that if NTLP state is still
                     established on NSLP_QoS_R-unaware node. NTLP will
                     save the content of NSLP message and forward this
