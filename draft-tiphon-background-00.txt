1. Abstract

   The background and objectives of the new ETSI project Tiphon
   architecture are described in this draft. The architecture is shown
   to be capable of use by a number of different signalling systems and
   session control protocols, including SIP and H.323. The opportunity
   exists for the IETF to help with the technology mappings for SIP to
   ensure inter-operation with other technologies through the TIPHON
   architecture.

3. Introduction to TIPHON

   For many observers TIPHON has been viewed as a Voice over Internet
   Protocol (VoIP) project. This is not wholly true. TIPHON has
   historically had two functions:

      1. Standardisation of VoIP
      2. Standardisation of VoIP interconnection and inter-working with
         existing SCNs

   TIPHON started in May 1997 with the scope to standardise the
   interworking between traditional PSTN/ISDN/GSM networks with H.323-
   based Voice over IP. Since then, the project has grown and has been
   refocused.

   The TIPHON project has moved into its current state largely by
   stealth. Unfortunately stealth does not lend itself to getting broad
   understanding. This paper attempts to bring context to the work of
   TIPHON and to try and put the new TIPHON architecture in focus.
   More details of the architecture can be found in a companion draft
   [1].

3.1 TIPHON scope

   TIPHON concluded that H.323-based VoIP networks could not deliver
   the IP telephony service on a par with feature rich existing
   networks. This made defining interworking between these two networks
   a daunting task. Rather than suspending the project until VoIP
   technology was mature enough, the TIPHON membership decided to start
   helping to mature the technology so that the interworking could be
   defined.

   TIPHON's scope is to interwork with all existing switched networks.
   This means that TIPHON can not focus on one set of technologies to
   interwork. So TIPHON isn't Voice over IP (VoIP) although it
   addresses this topic. It isn't voice over ISDN or voice over GSM or
   voice over ATM. TIPHON is about voice over networks. Importantly it
   is about harmonisation of all voice over network technologies. This
   is shown in figure 1 where TIPHON acts as the convergence point for
   all Voice over Network technologies (only a selection is shown).

   Most attempts to forge new telephone technologies have been founded
   on a single service: 3.1kHz telephony support. With the possible
   exceptions of DECT and TETRA all new base technologies in telephony
   have done little more than support narrow-band voice. The other
   major aim of networks pre-TIPHON has been to maintain reachability
   and connectivity.

   TIPHON concluded that H.323-based VoIP networks could not deliver
   the IP telephony service on a par with feature rich existing
   networks. This made defining interworking between these two networks
   a daunting task. Rather than suspending the project until VoIP
   technology was mature enough, the TIPHON membership decided to start
   helping to mature the technology so that the interworking could be
   defined.

3.2 TIPHON today

   Today, the objective of Project TIPHON is the specification of
   interoperability mechanisms and related parameters to enable
   multimedia communications to take place, to a defined quality of
   service, between switched circuit networks (SCN) and Internet
   Protocol (IP) based networks and their associated terminal
   equipment.

   The work is based on the following set of scenarios:

   0.      IP terminal to IP terminal
   1.      IP Terminal to an PSTN, ISDN or cellular terminal
   2.      PSTN, ISDN or cellular terminal to an IP terminal
   3.      PSTN, ISDN or cellular terminal to an PSTN, ISDN or cellular
     terminal, with the transit portion provided by an IP network
   4.      IP terminal to an IP terminal, with the transit portion provided
     over the ISDN

4  Introduction to TIPHON architecture

   TIPHON needed a well defined architecture to support its broad range
   of scenarios and technologies. Such an architecture has been defined
   in the last twelve months.

   This new TIPHON architecture was intended to support the deployment
   of commercial voice services over generic IP transport networks. A
   number of business constraints determine the architectural decisions
   made in the project.

   TIPHON's architecture was not intended to be constrained to a
   particular market or technology niche and has to take into account
   the freedoms of private network use as well as the constraints of
   Public Networks. This sets TIPHON apart from many other forums that
   focus on a particular application, business model or technology.

4.1 Constraints

   The TIPHON deliverables should cater to vendors and operators for
   the purpose of commercial (multimedia) telephony service. This posed
   a number of constraints on its work:

   - The services provided by networks using TIPHON specifications are
     for sale in the same market as Public Telephony. For a number of
     possible operators it is important to show how costs are built up
     even if the users are never billed on a per use basis. This means
     that, in the limit, it is possible to account and charge customers
     for resources used or for the period for which communication is
     possible. Many options for charging need to be supported.

   - There is a need to establish media flows with predictable or known
     Quality of Service. The use of best effort only conveyance is not
     suited to many customer expectations that were established with
     non IP networks.

   - In general, operators have a duty to keep information about
     customers and their communications confidential. This means that
     steps are needed to minimise to ability of other parties to
     intercept or eavesdrop on communications.

   - There are requirements to provide identification and location
     services to the Public Telephone Network. Today, these are often
     based on Calling Line Identification. Such information is
     invaluable in enabling the Emergency Services to despatch vehicles
     in an appropriate way and this capability needs to be retained on
     IP networks.

   - Operators are, of course, carrying information that may otherwise
     have been conveyed on the Public Telephone Network and the same
     obligations to assist Law Enforcement agencies are expected to
     apply. This is because the basis of regulation is independent of
     technology.

   - Each service provider can have its own policies on addressing and
     protocol choices, Quality of Service mechanisms and access
     control. The services offered, as well as the type of customer
     that is targeted, usually drive these choices. This choice is at
     the discretion of the service provider operating the network!

   - The need to ensure privacy means that the traditional assumption
     that addresses should have end to end meaning across global
     networks, such as the Internet, need not be valid.

   - Service Providers often consider their deployment details a
     strategic issue and want to keep them secret from competitors.
     This leads to a reduced use of automatic discovery techniques when
     compared to the Internet as a whole.

   The combination of all of these constraints led to an architecture
   that is unlike either the traditional switched networks or the
   Internet. It attempts to address its challenges in a unique
   combination of the two.

4. Why a functional architecture?

   In the earlier stages of project Tiphon there was an over emphasis
   on one set of implementation choice, namely H.323, and in profiling
   it for use to interconnect with the PSTN, ISDN and GSM. This was
   closely focussed on the original aims of the project.

   As the project progressed it became clear that the competing work of
   other standards bodies was progressing at an enormous rate and often
   had different objectives. The work of other bodies was often
   focussed on specific kinds of implementation and this lead to heated
   debate on what should be open interfaces and what should not. We
   often stumbled on differing interpretations of the functions
   performed by a given device in various bodies. The debate over the
   function split between a Media Gateway Controller and a Gateway and
   the relationship with a Gatekeeper started the requirements capture
   process for Megaco. The work at this stage seemed to be focussed on
   particular implementation or "boxes". These "boxes" were being
   targeted at particular signalling systems, which were the real
   instruments of competition. The battles between SIP, H.323, MGCP and
   the rest embodied the problem space. It seemed that there had to be
   a better way than expecting one signalling system to win so that
   interoperation could be obtained.

   Focus moved to a more generic functional architecture which could
   allow the main combatant protocols to inter-work at a basic level
   without compromising their ability to offer novel features.

   The project generated a new Functional Architecture to allow the
   abstract specification of service capabilities in a protocol
   independent manner. This allows service capabilities to inter-work,
   where that best serves the market and the public interest. The
   degree to which services are to be made standard is minimal. The
   goal is to specify the framework for simple calls and the most
   important issues of inter-working of services. This will not usually
   extend to the specification of complete services.

   A complete architecture of this kind should allow SIP, H.323 and
   other specialist systems to inter-work in a global network. The
   objective is to promote competition whilst ensuring that the
   expectations of inter-operation, which the public associate with the
   public network, are met. The architecture must also meet the
   constraints of privacy, accountability and the legal obligations
   described above.

5. Architecture design principles

   A number of principles have been used in the architecture, three are
   key:
   - Protocol independence, side-stepping protocol wars of-the-day and
     enabling interworking
   - separation of concerns into independent planes
   - orthogonality of the reference points through functional layers
     and domain separations.

5.1 Protocol independence

   The TIPHON architecture is defined in protocol independent
   information flows. These flows can be mapped to (implemented using)
   applicable protocols. The flows guarantee that the TIPHON architects
   can address the issues that need addressing first can be bothered
   with quirks of certain implementations later.
   Naturally, this process has not been performed in total isolation.
   During the definition of the information flows, protocol
   specifications of H.323, SIP, and ISUP have been consulted for
   sanity checks and to verify that the architecture would not place
   impossible demands on likely implementations.

5.2 Planes

   TIPHON separates the telephony application specific parts from
   generic (IP) transport issues. Figure 2, below shows this.

   +                                                                +

      +-----------------------------------------------------------+
       Figure 2. Separation of application and transport

   This split is significant for two main reasons:

   1. Other applications need to use the same network infrastructure.
      This implies that the functionality in the TIPHON Application
      plane must not be generic for the transport of other
      applications, i.e. QoS transport mechanisms do not belong there.

                         TIPHON backgrounder                July 2000


      The transport plane on the other hand must not contain
      functionality specific for one application. i.e. media quality
      negotiation does not belong here.

   2. Other service providers need to use the same transport network.
      This implies that the interface between the application and the
      transport may be the interface between two companies (i.e.
      transport user and transport provider), and other companies may
      have the same relationship (multiple transport users per
      transport provider and multiple providers per transport user).
      Each instance of the application-transport interface may be
      associated with its own contract and commercial relationship.

5.3 Domains

   A commercial deployment of any telecommunication service sees
   multiple domains or networks. The picture presented in Figure 3
   offers a simplified view in which a terminal accesses TIPHON
   services through an access network, and that TIPHON service
   completes the service by combining the capabilities of a number of
   access and transit networks through a network service layer.

      +--------+  +---------+  +---------+  +---------+  +--------+
          Figure 3: Architecture to provide TIPHON services

   TIPHON has to be able to differentiate the entity offering service
   from the one offering connectivity. In its earliest guise IP was
   conceived of as an example of an abstract network layer (i.e. to
   communicate between networks the actual network type did not need to
   be known, only its IP capability). A consequence of this separation
   is that protocols are not end to end in nature whilst information
   flows are end to end and generally symmetrical.

   Likewise, multiple domains may be associated with the registration
   of a user with a domain with which the user has a contractual
   relationship. Figure 4 shows the network types that may inter-
   operate during the registration of a user. One such domain is called
   an IP Telephony Network (IPTN).

   The Home IPTN is the principal place where the user information is
   stored. The Home IPTN provides the functions required for
   registration and for subscriber related operations.

   The Serving IPTN provides the function required to register the user
   and to forward the registration towards the Home IPTN.

   The Intermediate IPTN provides the functions required to connect the
   Serving IPTN and the Home IPTN during the registration. The
   intermediate IPTN is only present when the Serving IPTN and the Home
   IPTN are not directly connected.

   An IPTN may act as both the Serving IPTN and the Home IPTN.

5.4 Functional layers

   Each of the co-operating networks is treated as containing layers in
   which functional entities reside. It is these functional entities
   that provide the functionality of the network.

   Each domain is taken to have a similar set of functional elements
   although in each domain the functional elements may have different
   properties, protocols and other implementation specifics.

   The functional entities co-operate by exchanging information flows
   to provide simple calls and service capabilities. In the TIPHON
   documentation the information flows are described as a set of
   primitives with parameters (information elements) which are
   exchanged across reference points.

   Implementation of the TIPHON architecture means mapping the flows
   into signalling systems or protocols. This requires the primitives
   to be expressed as protocol messages and parameters. As a
   consequence a reference point may convey a set of information flows
   which are implemented using more than one protocol. Reference points
   in TIPHON are not described in terms of protocol. It is this
   separation between information flow and protocol that allows
   protocol independence.

   The implementation of information flows will be different for each
   protocol. Clearly the number protocol message needed to implement
   the information flows need not be equal to the number of primitives
   in the flows. The manner in which information elements are combined
   together, and with maintenance or error control information, to form
   protocol messages is a matter for the designers of each protocol.
   Each protocol implementation of the information flows must take
   account of transmission reliability, maintenance and security
   issues.

6. TIPHON, a capable network environment

   TIPHON is best described as a capable network environment. It offers
   capabilities that serve to support the capabilities of terminals
   whilst at the same time ensuring that the needs of business are met.
   The latter really means the ability to sell and re-sell network side
   capabilities, to sell and re-sell terminals, and to ultimately
   generate revenues.

   It is not true to say that TIPHON is a network nor is it true to say
   that TIPHON is a system. It is an environment. This environment goes
   beyond IP but is in many ways a candidate for a new generation of
   inter-working networks that uses the best of IP and the best of OSI.
   It does that by simplifying the knowledge required of the lower
   layers (extending IP), and by making the upper layers less obscure
   (simplification of OSI).

   Figure 4 shows the non-network, non-system, conclusion can be
   arrived at. There is more than one network involved, and not all
   have to be there.

           Figure 4: The TIPHON interconnect architecture

   The architecture of TIPHON has been developed to reflect this and is
   broadly abstracted:

        Call control is catered for;
        Terminal and user registration is catered for; and,
        Reachability is catered for.

   The unique capabilities of different access networks are catered for
   within this abstraction. At its most basic the abstraction offers a
   simple data structure that determines the Quality of Service from a
   bearer network. This data element is called the Quality of Service
   Bearer Descriptor (QoSBD).

   There are a number of core documents in TIPHON used to describe
   different aspects of TIPHON. These address for example the use of
   H.323 terminals and the capabilities of such terminals in a TIPHON
   environment.

7. Protocol dependent issues

   The common features of the architecture are documented as
   information flows. Each protocol, which inter-works using the
   architecture, is an implementation of the information flows. The
   semantics of the information elements must pass transparently or
   with well understood mappings between the protocol implementations.

   Tiphon considers BICC, SIP and H.323 as some of the technologies
   that need to be profiled and mapped into the information flows.
   Clearly the flow of ideas needs to be bi-directional with the design
   of SIP and other technologies taking TIPHON into account as well as
   TIPHON mapping the already specified parts of SIP etc.

   Any protocol suite that can implement the information flows for
   Tiphon simple call and the service capabilities can inter-work
   successfully within the Tiphon architecture. In particular co-
   operation in establishing the technology mappings of relevance to
   the IETF, such as SIP, would be beneficial to both communities.

   The protocol requirements extend beyond session establishment to
   QoS, NAT control and traffic policing as well as privacy and
   interception matters. Each mapping of the architecture to a given
   technology will be subject to a threat analysis to ensure that the
   new weaknesses are not added.

8. Conclusion

   TIPHON provides an architecture supporting the convergence of
   network technologies under an umbrella of common service that gives
   assured inter-working. This permits end-to-end working over
   heterogeneous transport networks using the TIPHON specifications.

   The new TIPHON architecture allows clear separation of network and
   service provider roles and provides a structured approach to service
   provision, system design and analysis, and allows flexible business
   models.

   TIPHON has approached (after much debate) network technologies and
   network architectures as intrinsically abstract. This has been
   realised as an architecture showing capabilities of functional
   entities and the information flows between them across well defined
   relationships. This has many similarities to the Stage 2 of the ITU
   I.130/I.210 approach but with re-thinking. In order to define
   abstract networks TIPHON has reviewed the method for definition and
   it is proposed that this abstract method be adopted by developers of
   access networks for future enhancements (currently available as work
   item TIPHON-01007 [2]).

   The development of TIPHON that makes it independent of the specific
   capabilities of networks is in the development of service capability
   definitions that lead to the specifications of service capabilities
   (in turn themselves as either network or user/terminal
   capabilities). The capabilities are defined as visible at particular
   points of reference.

   Through its structured approach the architecture provides solutions
   for current issues like IP telephony in the presence of firewalls
   and IN interworking.

   The reference points, their flows and behaviours are defined in [3].
   The QoS signalling companion document is defined in [4].

   These documents are available for public download through the URLs
   given.

9. Security Considerations

   The architecture for simple call has been augmented by changes for
   Quality of service. The functional elements needed for Lawful
   Interception will be added and a full threat analysis performed. The
   results of that analysis will then be used to improve the
   architecture.

   As the flows are mapped onto particular technologies and protocols
   there will be further threat analysis work since each protocol can
   introduce new issues.
