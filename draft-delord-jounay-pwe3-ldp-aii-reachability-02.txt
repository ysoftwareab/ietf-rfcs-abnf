Abstract 
    
   The dynamic End-to-End Multisegment pseudowire setup requires PEs to    
   maintain a pseudowire routing table when using FEC129. There is a 
   requirement to automatically advertise Attachment Individual    
   Identifiers to enable the pseudowire routing tables to be populated. 
   Two mechanisms already exist, a BGP reachability information 
   distribution mechanism and an IGP based one. Here we define a third 
   solution relying on LDP. It allows for automatic advertisement of the 
   Attachment Individual Identifier prefixes provisioned on a T-PE when 
   this node does not run BGP or IGP. The mechanism described here runs 
   on the T-LDP (Targeted LDP) session between the T-PE and S-PE, and  
   is intended to complement existing PW routing mechanisms using BGP or 
   OSPF.

Internet Draft           LDP AII Reachability          September 2008 
                                     

1. Introduction 
    
   This document describes procedures for PEs to populate their    
   Pseudowire (PW) routing tables via the Label Distribution Protocol 
   (LDP). It is targeted at MultiSegment Pseudowire (MS-PW) 
   applications. The dynamic End-to-End MS-PW architecture requires T-
   PEs and S-PEs to maintain a PW routing tables when using FEC129. The 
   procedure addresses MS-PW architectures where a T-PE does not (for 
   whatever reason) run either an Interior Gateway  Protocol (IGP) or 
   Multi-Protocol Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP). The mechanism 
   described here is intended to complement other existing PW routing 
   mechanisms already described in [DYN MS-PW], [BGP AD] and [OSPF MS-
   PW].  
    
   The need for MS-PWs is presented in [MS-PW REQ]. To allow for minimal 
   manual intervention/configuration, FEC129 needs to be used as per 
   [MS-PW] and [DYN MS-PW]. [RFC5003] describes the AII type and the 
   fields that identify pseudowire endpoints called attachment 
   individual identifiers (AII). 
    
   [DYN MS-PW] specifies a mechanism, based on the MP-BGP, that enables 
   the advertisement of MS-PW endpoint information in the form of 
   aggregated AIIs through the network, and thus allows the automatic 
   placement of MS-PWs. 
    
   [OSPF MS-PW] is another way of enabling the automatic placement of 
   MS-PWs across an OSPF domain when MP-BGP is not / cannot be used   
   (e.g. when PWE3 is extended into the access part of the network). 
 
2. Scope and Applicability 
    
2.1. Scope 
    
   One important application is the use of this ldp protocol extension 
   in access networks that use IP/MPLS as their access technology and 
   MS-PW to support L2 services (as per [MS-PW REQ]). MP-BGP or an IGP 
   is often not available in this part of the network.

                        Figure 1 MS-PW Use Case 
    
    
    
   Figure 1 describes a typical use case where T-PE1 and T-PE2 need to   
   establish one or several MS-PWs between them. A MS-PW will be    
   composed of at least two PW segments (PW Segt 1 between T-PE1 and S-

   PE1, PW Segt 2 between S-PE1 and S-PE2 and PW Segt 3 between S-PE2 
   and T-PE2). However T-PE1 is not running either an IGP or MP-BGP and 
   only has one static default route and a T-LDP session towards SPE1. 
   SPE1, SPE2 and TPE2 are running an IGP and/or MP-BGP. 
    
   The aim here is for T-PE1 to announce to the S-PE(s) with which it   
   has a T-LDP session (there may be more than one S-PE) its locally 
   attached PW routes, so that the S-PE(s) can populate their AII PW 
   routing table with the T-PE prefixes. 
    
   The AII prefixes locally defined on the T-PE are then advertised via 
   an LDP Address Message containing a new Address Family. This new 
   address family capability will follow the processes defined in [LDP 
   CAP]. 
    
   This document does not presuppose any specific constraint on the AII   
   PW addressing space (i.e it does not require the AII PW addressing   
   space to be a subset of the IP addressing space). Therefore, this 
   document does not define a routing protocol as such, but rather a 
   "reachability" information distribution method by which a T-PE 
   advertises its AII to a S-PE. The S-PE will then aggregate and 
   advertise this information, using one of the MS-PW dynamic placement 
   mechanisms e.g. MP-BGP, to the other S-PEs and T-PEs in the network. 
   Note that the S-PE will also advertise it's locally attached 
   prefixes, and possibly an optional "default PW route". 
    
2.2. Applicability 
    
   Section 7.1 of [DYN MS-PW] describes 7.1 the different rules for 
   aggregated AII PW routing table lookup. The next signaling hop for a 
   segment of the pseudowire may be determined via a fixed route (static 
   route and typically a "default route"). 
    
   In the case of MPLS enabled access networks, an S-PE (e.g. a DSLAM or 
   other access node) will aggregate up to a few thousands devices that 
   may require several pseudowires (or "services") on each of those 
   devices. 
    
   These devices may not require either an IGP or MP-BGP to be 
   integrated into  the network, for example because it may not be 
   desirable for a Service Provider to have to re-engineer their 
   metro/access architecture by extending their IGP or inserting MP-BGP 
   further down in the access network. However, they may require basic 
   LDP functionality to setup and maintain pseudowires. They can also be 
   configured with one or two default static routes as described in [DYN 
   MS-PW], however on the S-PE side, the provisioning required becomes 
   increasingly complex. Furthermore, the closer to the end node, it is 
   quite possible that some pseudowires be setup, removed or modified 
   (e.g. for a bandwidth upgrade) over a short timescale. Therefore, 
   there is a need for a mechanism that will alleviate the provisioning 
   burden on the S-PE(s).

3. LDP Extensions 
    
3.1. LDP AII Address Family Type 
    
    
   In the case described in this document, we assume LDP sessions    
   between the T-PE and related S-PEs. 
    
   A new Address Family (AF) type called "AII address family" (TBA) is 
   defined for the Address-List TLV carried in LDP Address and Address 
   Withdraw messages. 
    
   This new AF allows LDP peers to advertise directly attached AII 
   prefixes, as part of   an LDP Address Message and to withdraw 
   directly attached AII prefixes as part of an LDP Address Withdraw 
   Message. 
    
   When a T-PE needs to advertise a new AII prefix to an S-PE, it sends 
   an LDP Address Message containing the AII prefixes to all the S-PEs 
   with which it maintains LDP sessions. 
    
   When a T-PE needs to withdraw an AII, it sends an LDP Address   
   Withdraw Message containing the AII prefixes to all S-PEs with which   
   it maintains LDP sessions. 
    
   The Address-List TLV is defined in [RFC5036]. 
    
   AII address prefix is formatted according to AII Type II, defined in 
   [RFC5003] section 3.2 (figure 1).

   Prefix Length       One octet unsigned integer containing the length 
                        in bits of the address prefix that follows. The 
                        minimum prefix length for an AII address MUST be 
                        of 32 bits. Prefix lengths of 65 to 95 are 
                        invalid as the AC ID field cannot be aggregated.   
    
   Two AII Address prefixes (PW routes) are said to match only when both 
   the AII Type II as well as the 8 bits prefix length are the same.

3.2. LDP AII Reachability Capability Advertisement 
    
   In order to use this method of propagating l2 reachability 
   information a PE must first advertise this capability to all LDP 
   peers. This is achieved   by using the methods in [LDP-CAP] and 
   advertising the AII Address Family LDP capability TLV. If an LDP peer 
   supports the dynamic capability   advertisement, this can be done by 
   sending a new capability message with the S bit set for the AII 
   Address Family capability TLV when the first AII Prefix is enabled on 
   the PE. If the peer does not support dynamic capability 
   advertisement, then the AII Address Family TLV MUST be included in 
   the LDP initialization procedures in the capability parameter [LDP-
   CAP]. 
    
   The following TLV is defined to indicate the AII Address Family  
   capability: 
    
     0                   1                   2                   3

4. AII Reachability Advertisement Procedures 
    
    
   [RFC5036] defines the procedures by which LSRs maintain and exchange   
   label information via LDP.  
    
   This document does not change any of the standard LDP procedures; it   
   only adds the AII address family type for the Adress-List TLV carried 
   in LDP Address and Address Withdraw messages. 
    
   The rules for advertising and withdrawing addresses are as per [RFC 
   5036].  
    
4.1. Detailed AII Address Message Procedures 
    
    
   In order for a T-PE to begin advertising its locally attached AII 
   prefixes to   its S-PEs, the T-PE must know the address(es) of the 
   remote S-PE(s)  and already have a T-LDP with each one of those. This 
   information may have been configured on the T-PE, or it may have been 
   learned dynamically via some autodiscovery procedure.

4.1.1. T-PE Procedures 
    
   Upon provisioning on the T-PE with a prefix of one or more specific 
   AII(s), the T-PE MUST generate an Address Message including its ASN 
   and prefix, and optionally an aggregated AII representing its locally 
   attached AII address(es), to all the S-PEs with which it maintains T-
   LDP sessions. 
    
   The addresses are structured according to AII type II [RFC5003]. 
   The T-PE MUST only advertise its AIIs over its T-LDP sessions towards   
   its directly attached S-PEs.  
    
   Whenever an attachment circuit not addressed by an existing 
   aggregated already advertised AII is configured on a T-PE, the T-PE 
   MUST advertise the new address with an Address message. 
    
   Whenever a T-PE "de-activates" a previously advertised AII Prefix, it 
   SHOULD withdraw the AII Prefix with an Address Withdraw message. 
    
   A T-PE may re-advertise an address that it has   previously 
   advertised without explicitly withdrawing the address.  If the 
   receiver already has address binding, it SHOULD take no further 
   action. 
    
   A T-PE MAY withdraw an address without having previously advertised 
   it.  If the receiving S-PE has no address binding, it SHOULD take no 
   further action. 
    
4.1.2. S-PE Procedures 
    
   If a PE receives an address TLV containing an address family that it 
   does not support, it SHOULD follow the procedures defined in 
   [RFC5036]. 
    
   An S-PE receiving an address list TLV containing one or more AII 
   addresses should install those addresses in its local PW routing 
   table. It MAY also re-advertise those addresses using any another 
   supported dynamic MS-PW routing mechanism.
