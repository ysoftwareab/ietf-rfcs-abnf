1.  Introduction

   This draft identifies criteria to be used in evaluating and selecting
   Control and Reporting Protocols described by
   [I-D.ietf-lmap-framework].  Both mandatory and comparative criteria
   are identified for these protocols.

2.  Control Protocol Criteria

2.1.  Mandatory Criteria

   Following is a list of criteria that a Control Protocol is required
   to support.  Protocols that do not support these criteria will not be
   considered appropriate for selection by LMAP WG as a Control
   Protocol.  Although it is mandatory that the described mechanisms
   have been defined for a protocol (in order for the protocol to be
   considered by LMAP as a candidate Control Protocol), the mechanisms
   do not need to be mandatory to implement per the protocol
   specification.

   CP-MUST-1  There must be a mechanism that allows a Controller to
              cause a session to be established with a MA.  Identify
              this mechanism and where it is defined.

   CP-MUST-2  There must be a mechanism that allows a MA to cause a
              session to be established with a Controller.  Identify
              this mechanism and where it is defined.

   CP-MUST-3  The protocol session must be capable of being secured
              using secure credentials, as described in
              [I-D.ietf-lmap-framework].  The security mechanism must be
              useful for privacy protection, man-in-the-middle defense,
              and protection against replay.  Identify this mechanism
              and where it is defined.

   CP-MUST-4  The protocol must be versionable.  Identify the process
              for extending the protocol.

2.2.  Comparative Criteria

   Following is a list of criteria that can be used to differentiate
   among Control Protocol candidates.  For each criterion, it is also
   indicated what is considered "better" for a candidate protocol to
   support.

   CP-DIFF-1   How many exchanges are required to send a complete
               instruction set? (less is better)

   CP-DIFF-2   How many exchanges are required to send a status update?
               (less is better)

   CP-DIFF-3   Is it possible to provide partial updates? (yes is
               better)

   CP-DIFF-4   Are there any special mechanisms (other than STUN/TURN/
               ICE or using port forwarding pinholes, PCP, UPnP IGD,
               etc.) for NAT/firewall traversal?  (if subsequent
               evaluation of such a mechanism suggests it is useful and
               usable, yes is better)

   CP-DIFF-5   How many bytes of overhead (rough estimate or brief
               description of the source of overhead is acceptable) are
               required to send a complete instruction set? (less is
               better)

   CP-DIFF-6   How many bytes of overhead (rough estimate or brief
               description of the source of overhead is acceptable) are
               required to send a status update? (less is better)

   CP-DIFF-7   How widely used is the protocol and/or its protocol
               elements in mass market devices? (widely is better)

   CP-DIFF-8   What mechanisms exist to ensure interoperability of MA
               and Controller implementations (e.g., test tools,
               plugfests, certification programs, test plan or scripts,

               reference implementations to test against)? (existence of
               something is better)

   CP-DIFF-9   Are the components of the protocol available as open
               source? (yes is better)

   CP-DIFF-10  What ecosystem of tools exists for developers
               implementing the protocol (e.g., compilers, tutorials,
               sample and open source implementations; include tools for
               data model creation)? (existence of useful tools is
               better)

   CP-DIFF-11  Is the protocol versionable? (yes is better, or is this
               mandatory?)

   CP-DIFF-12  If yes, what is the process for extending the protocol?
               (for information)

   CP-DIFF-13  What are the encodings supported by the protocol (SOAP,
               JSON, XML, etc.)? (simple is better; lower overhead is
               better; other aspects still to be determined and
               discussed may be better)

3.  Report Protocol Criteria

3.1.  Mandatory Criteria

   Following is a list of criteria that a Report Protocol is required to
   support.  Protocols that do not support these criteria will not be
   considered appropriate for selection by LMAP WG as a Report Protocol.
   Although it is mandatory that the described mechanisms have been
   defined for a protocol (in order for the protocol to be considered by
   LMAP as a candidate Report Protocol), the mechanisms do not need to
   be mandatory to implement per the protocol specification.

   RP-MUST-1  There must be a mechanism that allows a MA to cause a
              session to be established with a Collector.  Identify this
              mechanism and where it is defined.

   RP-MUST-2  The protocol session must be capable of being secured
              using secure credentials, as described in
              [I-D.ietf-lmap-framework].  The security mechanism must be
              useful for privacy protection, man-in-the-middle defense,
              and protection against replay.  Identify this mechanism
              and where it is defined.

   RP-MUST-3  The protocol must be versionable.  Identify the process
              for extending the protocol.

3.2.  Comparative Criteria

   Following is a list of criteria that can be used to differentiate
   among Report Protocol candidates.  For each criterion, it is also
   indicated what is considered "better" for a candidate protocol to
   support.

   RP-DIFF-1   What transport protocols (TCP, UDP, other) can be used
               with the protocol?  (WG to decide what is better)

   RP-DIFF-2   Is a congestion control mechanism supported? (yes is
               better)

   RP-DIFF-3   How many exchanges are required to send a report? (less
               is better)

   RP-DIFF-4   Does it allow for sending multiple reports in a session?
               (yes is better)

   RP-DIFF-5   Is there a capability for long-lived sessions. (yes is
               better)

   RP-DIFF-6   Is compression supported? (yes is better, or is this
               mandatory?)

   RP-DIFF-7   How many bytes of overhead (rough estimate or brief
               description of the source of overhead is acceptable) are
               required to send a report? (less is better)

   RP-DIFF-8   How widely used is the protocol and/or its protocol
               elements in mass market devices? (widely is better)

   RP-DIFF-9   What mechanisms exist to ensure interoperability of MA
               and Collector implementations (e.g., test tools,
               plugfests, certification programs, test plan or scripts,
               reference implementations to test against)? (existence of
               something is better)

   RP-DIFF-10  Are the components of the protocol available as open
               source? (yes is better)

   RP-DIFF-11  What ecosystem of tools exists for developers
               implementing the protocol (e.g., compilers, tutorials,
               sample and open source implementations; include tools for
               data model creation)? (existence of useful tools is
               better)
