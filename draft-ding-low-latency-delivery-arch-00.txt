            Architecture for delivering low latency service
                draft-ding-low-latency-delivery-arch-00

Abstract

   Demand for Ultra high-Reliability and Low-latency Communication
   (URLLC) and Broadband Assured IP Services (BAS) will grow as new
   service scenarios like 5G, IoT, AR/VR, Cloud are deployed.  As these
   new service scenarios will typically rely on shared packet
   infrastructure like Internet, methods to ensure URLLC and BAS
   performance across the underlying network resources will be required.
   This document outlines the motivation and key requirements for URLLC
   or BAS connectivity across heterogeneous network domains.  It also
   outlines the corresponding models and architecture required for
   providing orchestrated URLLC or BAS communication.

1.  Introduction

   Low latency communications have been recently received much interest
   such as those in Ultra high-Reliability and Low-latency Communication
   (URLLC) and Broadband Assured IP Services (BAS) [BAS-Architecture].
   Further investigation and requirements gathering is required.  Such
   investigation should also build on existing IETF work, including
   transport, security, and web technology and protocols effort [I-
   D.arkko-arch-low-latency].  In parallel to the IETF efforts, relevant
   discussion is ongoing including Time-Sensitive Networking Task Group
   [TSN8021] in IEEE 802.1, 5G requirements for next-generation access
   technology [TS38913]in 3GPP and BAS in BBF.

   We may further scope the URLLC and BAS application requirements by
   explicitly involving end-to-end (E2E) service characteristics and
   capability requirements.  E2E service usually traverses multiple
   domains and involves multiple layers.  Yet, existing standards and
   current discussion typically focuses on a specific layer, protocol or
   link layer technology.  This myopic view lacks a holistic approach or
   system view on solving the URLLC and BAS problem space.

   This draft identifies common URLLC and BAS application requirements
   in heterogeneous networks and key challenges for delivering suitable
   application and user Quality of Experience (QoE).  It analyses the
   applicability of existing technologies, and where necessary documents
   the gaps between URLLC/BAS requirements and network implementations.

   Furthermore, the document proposes models and architecture to provide
   orchestrated URLLC or BAS communication.

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2.  Requirements for delivery low latency services in heterogeneous
    networks

   Emerging URLLC and BAS applications, such as self-driving cars,
   industrial control, real-time gaming, AR/VR, and Cloud based
   applications, introduce new requirements such as high reliability and
   low latency on data transmission.  For instance, in 5GPPP, the most
   stringent requirements on latency and reliability that we have
   identified relate to self-driving cars, where E2E latencies down to
   1ms must be provided with a reliability of 1-10^-9.  In other words,
   only one message in 10^9 data transfers may be lost or delayed by
   more than 1ms when the latency budget is set to 1ms.

   Since these applications would force the development for high
   reliability and low latency networking, monitoring and storing the
   latency performance across the network, and latency guarantee in each
   network segment or even node.  Unlike current packet network which is
   typically best-effort, making such latency guarantee is very
   difficult to achieve.

   Multiple methods are being proposed to solve such latency guarantee
   issue, including cooperative hierarchical caching and routing,
   hardware acceleration, high-data throughput in the aggregation
   network, fog computing and mobile edge computing facilitating the

   placement of compute and applications as close to the consumer as
   possible.

   From the Internet stack perspective, improvement for communication
   latency may be achieved at multiple layers.  More recent technologies
   are being developed to reduce the communication latency, such as
   [L4S], [DETNET], [FlexE].  With such technologies, different network
   operators can build their own low latency networks.  For instance,
   each technology can be modelled as a network service for latency
   improvement, but often restricted to a specific domain or layer.

   Typically, heterogeneous networks are composed of a wide-range of
   network segments traversing multiple domains and involving multiple
   layers.  Existing low latency technologies typically focus on
   specific layer, protocol or link.  With such diverse networks, it
   becomes very challenging to deliver low latency for E2E services.

   Multiple technical proposals have described similar requirements
   discussed in this document, such as [I-D.dunbar-e2e-latency-arch-
   view-and-gaps] and [I-D.arkko-arch-low-latency].  BAS has discussed
   performance assurance of E2E services [BAS-Architecture].  From
   industrial automation perspective, 3GPP specification 22.282 has also
   defined latency requirement for robot control applications.

3.  Application requirements and network performance

   Application requirements can be modeled as Quality of Experience
   (QoE), and qualified by various service KQIs.  From users'
   perspective, QoE is the overall performance perception of the
   service.

   Network performance can be evaluated by network KPIs such as delay,
   jitter, and packet loss.  As mentioned, URLLC and BAS applications
   require the capabilities of high reliability and low latency
   networking, which is unlike the current best-effort packet network.
   Hence, it is important to identify and manage network KPIs to
   quantify and achieve the corresponding service KQI, as shown in below
   figure.  The KQI for a given service can be expressed as a function
   of a set of KPIs, expressed as KQI=f(KPI1, KPI2, ..., KPIn).

   However, how to map URLLC and BAS application KQI to the
   corresponding set of network KPIs could be challenging.  Furthermore,
   there could be potential need of defining new network KPI (e.g.
   latency down to 1ms must be provided with a reliability of 1-10^-9)
   to reflect some new application requirements.

4.  Low latency delivery models

4.1.  Application service and network service model

   Application service model has information about application level
   policies and requirements, such as end user information, application
   service attributes.  Such model is constructed based on service KQIs.
   Below figure shows an example of application service model.

   +-------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | Service Name      | KQI Value                         |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | 4K/8K Video       | quality/zap time/response time    |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | Bank Transaction  | transaction Rate/Locking/Idle Time|
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | Driving assistant | map updated time/map accuracy     |

   | VR/AR             | data rate/delay                   |
   |-------------------+-----------------------------------+
   | Factory Automation| real-time control/automation      |
   |-------------------+-----------------------------------+


   Network service model is used to describe the configuration, state
   data, operations and notifications of abstract representations of

   services.  Take L2VPN service model as example [L2SM], it provides an
   abstracted view of the L2VPN service configuration components, which
   contains L2VPN domain relevant information, as well as network QoS or
   KPI information in the L2VPN domain.

   As mentioned in previous section, the latency sensitive applications
   might traverse multiple domains and need E2E latency guarantee across
   multiple domains.  Assuming the maximum latency is guaranteed and
   cannot exceed a predefined value called MAX-LATENCY, the MAX-LATENCY
   should be divided into multiple latency values and mapped to multiple
   domains.  In each domain, the transmission latency must be guaranteed
   less than the latency value allocated to it.

   Some network KPI metrics of the network service model are listed in
   below figure.  Note that the KPIs of latency bound and reliability
   could be new element, compared to existing network service model, in
   order to support the aforementioned new URLLC and BAS applications.

   +--------------------+------------------+
   | KPI Name           | KPI Value        |

   | Service type       | 4K/8K/VR etc     |

   | Service Profile    | Platinum/Gold/   |

   | Latency bound      | MAX-LATENCY      |

   | Reliability        | MAX-RELIABILITY  |
   |--------------------+------------------+
   | throughput         | MAX-THROUGHPUT   |
   |--------------------+------------------+
   | packet loss rate   | MAX-PKTLOSSRATE  |
   |--------------------+------------------+
   | jitter             | MAX-JITTER       |
   |--------------------+------------------+
   |bandwidth           | MAX-BANDWIDTH    |
   |--------------------+------------------+




   The network service model shown in Figure 3 can be generic in the
   sense that it has no assumption on the underlying network
   technologies.  It is up to the network provider to translate this
   network service model to specific network service models based on the

   underlying network implementation, such as L2/L3VNF service model,
   Detnet service model, FlexE/MPLS configurations, etc.

4.2.  OAM model

   During each latency performance measurement period, latency metric is
   sent to the OAM model ready to be analyzed.  Periodically, OAM model
   retrieves aggregated monitored data and applies data classification
   techniques to filter the data.  OAM model is responsible for
   monitoring the reliability of the filtered data, and performs trouble
   shooting based on the preconfigured reliability requirement.  If the
   analyzed reliability of traffic data is lower than the preconfigured
   reliability, OAM model issues a problem report.  Some parameters in
   OAM model are listed in below figure.

   | Name               | Elements         |

5.  Low latency delivery architecture

5.1.  Architecture Overview

   Below figure shows an architecture for low latency service delivery
   (LLD).  It could be beneficial to define low latency delivery
   architecture (or cook book) to coordinate and orchestrate multiple
   low latency tools, in order to support low latency requirements from
   user's perspective.  Note that LLD architecture has referred to ABNO
   architecture [ABNO] especially the layer design, components
   definition, etc.

5.2.  Components

5.2.1.  LLD orchestrator

   The LLD orchestrator is responsible to translate the generic network
   service model into the specific network service models, such as data
   model for L2VPN service delivery [L2SM], data model for L3VPN service
   delivery [RFC8049], and data model for EVPN [draft-ietf-bess-evpn-
   yang], in corresponding domains.

   Each domain has a separate controller that is responsible for
   receiving the network configuration from LLD orchestrator.  Based on
   the network configuration, the controller learns how to control the
   network elements.  One representative example of controller is PCE
   controller.

5.2.2.  OAM Handler

   Latency measurement is also very crucial to make sure the latency
   bound is not violated and useful for E2E latency aware OAM mechanism.
   There is a need to support the measurement of latency inside of a
   network device.

   Existing technologies such as OWAMP [RFC4656] and TWAMP [RFC5357] is
   focused on providing one way and two-way IP performance metrics.
   Latency is one of metrics that can be used for E2E deterministic
   latency provisioning.  Use OWAMP/TWAMP protocols or extension on that
   to support measurement of flow latency performance is feasible.

   The OAM Handler is responsible for monitoring the network elements,
   collecting the measurement results and receiving notifications from
   the network elements.  The OAM Handler also reports network
   performance and problems to NMS/OSS/application service coordinator.

5.2.3.  Policy agent

   Policy agent is configured by the NMS/OSS, and it is connected to
   some components where the corresponding policy can be applied to.

5.3.  Functional interfaces

5.3.1.  Low latency path computation

   Low latency path computation is a critical and fundamental feature
   because individual controller in each domain is only able to share
   abstracted information that is local to their domain.

   Via the interface between LLD orchestrator and controller, the
   controller gets the network service configuration and learns the
   latency upper bound value in its domain.  After that, the controller
   computes the optimized path to cover the latency upper bound, and
   reserves and activate corresponding network resource for the path.

5.3.2.  OAM and report

   OAM Handler interacts with the network to perform several actions:

   Enabling OAM function within the network.

   Performing proactive OAM operations in the network.

   Receiving notifications of network events.

Internet-Draft             low latency service                 July 2017


   For low latency service, OAM handler correlates events reported from
   network and reports them onward to the LLD orchestrator and to the
   NMS/OSS/Application service coordinator.
