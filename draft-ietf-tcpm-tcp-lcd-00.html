<h1><br />Making TCP more Robust to Long Connectivity Disruptions (TCP-LCD)<br />draft-ietf-tcpm-tcp-lcd-00</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Disruptions in end-to-end path connectivity, which last longer
            than one retransmission timeout cause suboptimal TCP performance.
            The reason for the performance degradation is that TCP interprets
            segment loss induced by long connectivity disruptions as a sign of
            congestion, resulting in repeated retransmission timer backoffs.
            This leads in turn to a deferred detection of the re-establishment
            of the connection since TCP waits until the next retransmission
            timeout occurs before attempting the retransmission.
</p>
<p>This document proposes a algorithm for making TCP more
            robust to long connectivity disruptions (TCP-LCD). The memo
            describes how standard ICMP messages can be exploited during
            timeout-based loss recovery to disambiguate true congestion loss
            from non-congestion loss caused by connectivity disruptions.
            Moreover, a revert strategy of the retransmission timer is
            specified that enables a more prompt detection of whether the
            connectivity to a previously disconnected peer node has been
            restored or not. TCP-LCD is a TCP sender-only modification that
            effectively improves TCP performance in presence of connectivity
            disruptions.

            "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
            <a class='info' href='#RFC2119'>[RFC2119]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Bradner, S., &ldquo;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The reader should be familiar with the algorithm and terminology
            from <a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>[RFC2988]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M. Allman, &ldquo;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, which defines the standard algorithm
            Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) senders are required to use to
            compute and manage their retransmission timer. In this document the
            terms "retransmission timer" and "retransmission timeout" are used
            as defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>[RFC2988]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M. Allman, &ldquo;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>. The retransmission timer
            ensures data delivery in the absence of any feedback from the receiver.
            The duration of this timer is referred to as retransmission timeout
            (RTO).
</p>
<p>As defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a>, the term "acceptable
            acknowledgment (ACK)" refers to a TCP segment that acknowledges
            previously unacknowledged data. The TCP sender state variable
            "SND.UNA" and the current segment variable "SEG.SEQ" are used as
            defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a>. SND.UNA holds the segment
            sequence number of earliest segment that has not been acknowledged
            by the TCP receiver (the oldest outstanding segment). SEG.SEQ is the
            segment sequence number of a given segment.
</p>
<p>For the purposes of this specification we define the term
            "timeout-based loss recovery" that refers to the state, which a TCP
            sender enters upon the first timeout of the oldest outstanding
            segment (SND.UNA) and leaves upon the arrival of the *first*
            acceptable ACK. It is important to note that other
            documents use a different interpretation of the term "timeout-based
            loss recovery". For example the NewReno modification to TCP's Fast
            Recovery algorithm <a class='info' href='#RFC3782'>[RFC3782]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd, S., Henderson, T., and A. Gurtov, &ldquo;The NewReno Modification to TCP's Fast Recovery Algorithm,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> extents the period a
            TCP sender remains in timeout-based loss recovery compared to the
            one defined in this document. This is because
            <a class='info' href='#RFC3782'>[RFC3782]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Floyd, S., Henderson, T., and A. Gurtov, &ldquo;The NewReno Modification to TCP's Fast Recovery Algorithm,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> attempts to avoid unnecessary multiple
            Fast Retransmits that can occur after an RTO.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Connectivity disruptions can occur in many different situations.
            The frequency of the connectivity disruptions depends thereby on
            the property of the end-to-end path between the communicating
            hosts. While connectivity disruptions can occur in traditional
            wired networks too, e.g., simply due to an unplugged network cable,
            the likelihood of occurrence is significantly higher in wireless
            (multi-hop) networks. Especially, end-host mobility, network
            topology changes and wireless interferences are crucial factors. In
            the case of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
            <a class='info' href='#RFC0793'>[RFC0793]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Transmission Control Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a>, the performance of the connection can
            exhibit a significant reduction compared to a permanently connected
            path <a class='info' href='#SESB05'>[SESB05]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schuetz, S., Eggert, L., Schmid, S., and M. Brunner, &ldquo;Protocol enhancements for intermittently connected                         hosts,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. This is because TCP, which was
            originally designed to operate in fixed and wired networks,
            generally assumes that the end-to-end path connectivity is
            relatively stable over the connection's lifetime.
</p>
<p>Depending on their duration connectivity disruptions
            can be classified into two groups
            <a class='info' href='#I-D.schuetz-tcpm-tcp-rlci'>[I&#8209;D.schuetz&#8209;tcpm&#8209;tcp&#8209;rlci]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schuetz, S., Koutsianas, N., Eggert, L., Eddy, W., Swami, Y., and K. Le, &ldquo;TCP Response to Lower-Layer Connectivity-Change Indications,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>: "short" and "long"
            connectivity disruptions. A connectivity disruption is "short" if
            connectivity returns before the retransmission timer fires for the
            first time. In this case, TCP recovers lost data segments through
            Fast Retransmit and lost acknowledgments (ACK) through successfully
            delivered later ACKs. Connectivity disruptions are declared as
            "long" for a given TCP connection, if the retransmission timer
            fires at least once before connectivity returns. Whether or not
            path characteristics, like the round trip time (RTT) or the
            available bandwidth have changed when the connectivity returns
            after a disruption is another important aspect for TCP's
            retransmission scheme <a class='info' href='#I-D.schuetz-tcpm-tcp-rlci'>[I&#8209;D.schuetz&#8209;tcpm&#8209;tcp&#8209;rlci]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schuetz, S., Koutsianas, N., Eggert, L., Eddy, W., Swami, Y., and K. Le, &ldquo;TCP Response to Lower-Layer Connectivity-Change Indications,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>This document improves TCP's behavior in case of "long
            connectivity disruptions". In particular, it focuses on the period
            "prior" to the re-establishment of the connectivity to a previously
            disconnected peer node. The document does not describe any additional
            modification to detect whenever the path characteristics remain
            unchanged in order to improve TCP's behavior once connectivity has
            been restored. Hence, TCP's basic congestion control mechanisms
            <a class='info' href='#RFC5681'>[RFC5681]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Allman, M., Paxson, V., and E. Blanton, &ldquo;TCP Congestion Control,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> will be unchanged.
</p>
<p>When a long connectivity disruption occurs on a TCP connection,
            the TCP sender stops receiving acknowledgments. After the
            retransmission timer expires, the TCP sender enters the
            timeout-based loss recovery and declares the oldest outstanding
            segment (SND.UNA) as lost. Since TCP tightly couples reliability
            and congestion control, the retransmission of SND.UNA is triggered
            together with the reduction of sending rate, which is based on the
            assumption that segment loss is indication of congestion
            <a class='info' href='#RFC5681'>[RFC5681]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Allman, M., Paxson, V., and E. Blanton, &ldquo;TCP Congestion Control,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. As long as the connectivity disruption
            persists, TCP will repeat this procedure until the oldest
            outstanding segment is successfully acknowledged, or the connection
            times out. TCP implementations that follow the recommended
            retransmission timeout (RTO) management of <a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>RFC&nbsp;2988<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M. Allman, &ldquo;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2988] double the RTO after each retransmission
            attempt. However, the RTO growth may be bounded by an upper limit,
            the maximum RTO, which is at least 60s, but may be longer: Linux
            for example uses 120s. If the connectivity is restored between two
            retransmission attempts, TCP still has to wait until the
            retransmission timer expires before resuming transmission, since it
            simply does not have any means to know when the connectivity is
            re-established. Therefore, depending on when connectivity becomes
            available again, this can waste up to maximum RTO of possible
            transmission time.
</p>
<p>This retransmission behavior is not efficient, especially in
            scenarios where long connectivity disruptions are frequent. In the
            ideal case, a TCP would attempt a retransmission as soon as
            connectivity to its peer is re-established. In this document, we
            specify a TCP sender-only modification to provide robustness
            to long connectivity disruptions (TCP-LCD). The memo describes how
            the standard Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) can be
            exploited during timeout-based loss recovery to identify
            non-congestion loss caused by long connectivity disruptions.
            TCP-LCD's revert strategy of the retransmission timer enables, due
            to higher-frequency retransmissions, a prompt detection when the
            connectivity to a previously disconnected peer node has been
            restored. In the case the network allows, i.e., no congestion is
            present, TCP-LCD approaches the ideal behavior.

Connectivity Disruption Indication</h3>

<p>As long as the queue of an intermediate router experiencing a link
            outage is deep enough, i.e., it can buffer all incoming packets, a
            connectivity disruption will only cause variation in delay, which is
            handled well by contemporary TCP implementations with the help of
            Eifel <a class='info' href='#RFC3522'>[RFC3522]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ludwig, R. and M. Meyer, &ldquo;The Eifel Detection Algorithm for TCP,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC4015'>[RFC4015]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ludwig, R. and A.

Hata, &ldquo;Forward RTO-Recovery (F-RTO): An Algorithm for Detecting Spurious Retransmission Timeouts with TCP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
            However, if the link outage lasts too long, the router experiencing
            the link outage is forced to drop packets and finally to discard the
            according route. Means to detect such link outages comprise reacting
            on failed address resolution protocol (ARP) <a class='info' href='#RFC0826'>[RFC0826]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Plummer, D., &ldquo;Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol: Or converting network protocol addresses to 48.bit Ethernet address for transmission on Ethernet hardware,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1982.</span><span>)</span></a>
            queries, unsuccessful link sensing, and the like. However, this is
            solely in the responsibility of the respective router.

<p>Provided that no other route (including no default route) to the
            specific destination exists, the removal of the route goes along
            with a notification to the corresponding sending host about the
            dropped packets via ICMP destination unreachable messages of code 0
            (net unreachable) or code 1 (host unreachable) <a class='info' href='#RFC1812'>[RFC1812]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., &ldquo;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a>. Therefore, since the reception of ICMP
            destination unreachable messages of these codes provide evidence
            that packets were dropped due to a link outage, the sending host
            can use them as an indication for a connectivity
            disruption.
</p>
<p>Note that there are also other ICMP destination unreachable
            messages with different codes. Some of them are candidates for
            connectivity disruption indications too, but need further
            investigation. For example ICMP destination unreachable messages
            with code 5 (source route failed), code 11 (net unreachable for
            TOS), or code 12 (host unreachable for TOS)
            <a class='info' href='#RFC1812'>[RFC1812]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., &ldquo;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a>. On the other hand codes that flag hard
            errors are of no use for the proposed scheme, since TCP should
            abort the connection when those are received
            <a class='info' href='#RFC1122'>[RFC1122]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, R., &ldquo;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1989.</span><span>)</span></a>. In the following, the term "ICMP
            unreachable message" is used as synonym for ICMP destination
            unreachable messages of code 0 or code 1.
</p>
<p>The accurate interpretation of ICMP unreachable messages as a
            connectivity disruption indication is complicated by the following
            two peculiarities of ICMP messages. Firstly, they do not necessarily
            operate on the same timescale as the packets, i.e., in the given
            case TCP segments that elicited them. When a router drops a
            packet due to a missing route it will not necessarily send an ICMP
            unreachable message immediately, but rather queues it for later
            delivery. Secondly, ICMP messages are subject to rate limiting,
            e.g., when a router drops a whole window of data due to a link
            outage, it will hardly send as many ICMP unreachable messages as it
            dropped TCP segments. Depending on the load of the router it may
            even send no ICMP unreachable messages at all. Both peculiarities
            originate from <a class='info' href='#RFC1812'>[RFC1812]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., &ldquo;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, according to <a class='info' href='#RFC0792'>[RFC0792]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Internet Control Message Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a> ICMP
            unreachable messages are obliged to contain in their body the
            entire Internet Protocol (IP) header <a class='info' href='#RFC0791'>[RFC0791]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Internet Protocol,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1981.</span><span>)</span></a> of
            the datagram eliciting the ICMP unreachable messages plus the first
            64 bits of the payload of that datagram. This allows the sending
            host to match the ICMP error message to the transport that elicited
            it. <a class='info' href='#RFC1812'>RFC 1812<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., &ldquo;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC1812] augments the
            requirements and states that ICMP messages should contain as much
            of the original datagram as possible without the length of the ICMP
            datagram exceeding 576 bytes. Therefore, in case of TCP, at least
            the source port number, the destination port number, and the 32-bit
            TCP sequence number are included. Thus, this allows the originating
            TCP to demultiplex the received ICMP message and to identify the
            connection which an ICMP unreachable message is reporting an error
            about. Moreover, it can identify which segment of the respective
            connection triggered the ICMP unreachable message, provided that
            there are not several segments in-flight with the same sequence
            number (see <a class='info' href='#discuss_retrans_ambiguity'>Section&nbsp;5.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Retransmission Ambiguity</span><span>)</span></a>).
</p>
<p>A connectivity disruption indication in form of an ICMP
            unreachable message associated with a presumably lost TCP segment
            provides strong evidence that the segment was not dropped due to
            congestion but instead was successfully delivered to the temporary
            end-point of the employed path, i.e., the reporting router. It
            therefore did not witness any congestion at least on that very part
            of the path that was traveled by both, the TCP segment eliciting
            the ICMP unreachable message as well as the ICMP unreachable
            message itself.

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
Basic Idea</h3>

<p>The goal of the algorithm is the prompt detection when the
                connectivity to a previously disconnected peer node has been
                restored after a long connectivity disruption while retaining
                appropriate behavior in case of congestion. TCP-LCD exploits
                standard ICMP unreachable messages during timeout-based loss
                recovery to increase the TCP's retransmission frequency by
                undoing one retransmission timer backoff whenever an ICMP
                unreachable message reports on the sequence number of a
                presumably lost retransmission.
</p>
<p>This approach has the advantage of appropriately reducing the
                probing rate in case of congestion. If either the
                retransmission itself, or the corresponding ICMP message is
                dropped the previously performed retransmission timer backoff is
                not undone, which effectively halves the probing rate.

Algorithm Details</h3>

<p>A TCP sender using <a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>RFC&nbsp;2988<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M. Allman, &ldquo;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2988]
                to compute TCP's retransmission timer MAY employ the following
                scheme to avoid over-conservative retransmission timer backoffs
                in case of long connectivity disruptions. If a TCP sender does
                implement the following steps, the algorithm MUST be initiated
                upon the first timeout of the oldest outstanding segment
                (SND.UNA) and MUST be stopped upon the arrival of the first
                acceptable ACK. The algorithm MUST NOT be re-initiated upon
                subsequent timeouts for the same segment.
</p>
<p>A TCP sender that does not employ
                <a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>RFC&nbsp;2988<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M. Allman, &ldquo;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2988] to compute TCP's
                retransmission timer SHOULD NOT use TCP-LCD. We envision that
                the scheme could be easily adapted to other algorithms than
                RFC&nbsp;2988. However, we leave this as future work.
</p>
<p>In rule (2.5) <a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>RFC&nbsp;2988<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M. Allman, &ldquo;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC2988]
                provides the option to place a maximum value on the RTO. When a
                TCP implements this rule to provide an upper bound for the RTO,
                the rule SHOULD also be used in the following algorithm. In
                particular, if the RTO is bounded by an upper limit (maximum
                RTO), the "MAX_RTO" variable used in this scheme SHOULD be
                initialized with this upper limit. Otherwise, if the RTO is
                unbounded, the "MAX_RTO" variable SHOULD be set to infinity.
</p>
<p>The scheme specified in this document uses the "BACKOFF_CNT"
                variable, whose initial value is zero. The variable is used to
                count the number of performed retransmission timer backoffs
                during one timeout-based loss recovery. Moreover, the "RTO_BASE"
                variable is used to recover the previous RTO in case the
                retransmission timer backoff was unnecessary. The variable is
                initialized with the RTO upon initiation of timeout-based
                loss recovery.

<p>When a TCP in steady-state detects a segment loss using the
                retransmission timer it enters the timeout-based loss recovery
                and initiates the algorithm (step 1). It adjusts the slow start
                threshold (ssthresh), sets the congestion window (CWND) to one
                segment, backs off the retransmission timer and retransmits
                the first unacknowledged segment (step R)
                <a class='info' href='#RFC5681'>[RFC5681]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Allman, M., Paxson, V., and E.

                for the expiration of the retransmission timer the TCP sender

</p>
<p>In case the retransmission timer expires again (step 3a) a
                TCP will repeat the retransmission of the first unacknowledged
                segment and back off the retransmission timer once more (step R)
                <a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>[RFC2988]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M. Allman, &ldquo;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a> as well as increment the "BACKOFF_CNT"
                variable by one (step 2). Note that a TCP may implement

                maximum value on the RTO that may result in not performing the
                retransmission timer backoff. However, step (2) MUST always
                and unconditionally be applied, no matter whether the
                retransmission timer is actually backed off or not. In other
                words, each time the retransmission timer expires, the
                "BACKOFF_CNT" variable MUST be incremented by one.
</p>
<p>If the first received packet after the retransmission(s) is
                an acceptable ACK (step 3b), a TCP will proceed as normal, i.e.,
                slow start the connection and terminate the algorithm (step A).
                Later ICMP unreachable messages from the just terminated
                timeout-based loss recovery are of no use and therefore ignored
                since the ACK clock is already restarting due to the successful
                retransmission.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the first received packet after the
                retransmission(s) is an ICMP unreachable message (step 3c) and
                if step (4) allows, a TCP SHOULD undo one backoff for each ICMP
                unreachable message reporting an error on a retransmission. To
                decide if an ICMP unreachable message reports on a
                retransmission, the sequence number therein is exploited (step
                5, step 6). The undo is performed by re-calculating the RTO
                with the decremented "BACKOFF_CNT" variable (step 7). This
                calculation explicitly matches the (bounded) exponential
                backoff specified in rule (5.5) of <a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>[RFC2988]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M. Allman, &ldquo;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Upon receipt of an ICMP unreachable message that legitimately
                undoes one backoff there is the possibility that the shortened
                retransmission timer has expired already (step 8). Then, a TCP
                SHOULD retransmit immediately, i.e., an ICMP message clocked
                retransmission. In case the shortened retransmission timer has
                not expired yet, TCP MUST wait accordingly.

Discussion of TCP-LCD</h3>

<p>TCP-LCD takes caution to only react to connectivity disruption
            indications in form of ICMP unreachable messages during
            timeout-based loss recovery. Therefore, TCP's behavior is not altered
            when either no ICMP unreachable messages are received, or the
            retransmission timer of the TCP sender did not yet expire since the
            last received acceptable ACK. Thereby, the algorithm triggers by
            definition only in the case of long connectivity disruptions.
</p>
<p>Only such ICMP unreachable messages that report on the sequence
            number of a retransmission, i.e., report on SND.UNA, are evaluated
            by TCP-LCD. All other ICMP unreachable messages are ignored. The
            arrival of those ICMP unreachable messages provides strong evidence
            that the retransmissions were not dropped due to congestion but
            instead were successfully delivered to the temporary end-point of
            the employed path, i.e., the reporting router. In other words,
            there is no witness for any congestion at least on that very part
            of the path that was traveled by both, the TCP segment eliciting
            the ICMP unreachable message as well as the ICMP unreachable
            message itself.
</p>
<p>However, there are some situations where TCP-LCD makes a false
            decision and undoes a retransmission timer backoff wrongly. This
            can happen, albeit the received ICMP unreachable message reports on
            the segment number of a retransmission (SND.UNA), because the TCP
            segment that elicited the ICMP unreachable message may either not
            be a retransmission (<a class='info' href='#discuss_retrans_ambiguity'>Section&nbsp;5.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Retransmission Ambiguity</span><span>)</span></a>),
            or does not belong to the current timeout-based loss recovery
            (<a class='info' href='#discuss_wrap_sequence_numbers'>Section&nbsp;5.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Wrapped Sequence Numbers</span><span>)</span></a>). Finally, packet
            duplication (<a class='info' href='#discuss_packet_dup'>Section&nbsp;5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Duplication</span><span>)</span></a>) can also
            spuriously trigger the algorithm.

Retransmission Ambiguity</h3>

<p>Historically, the retransmission ambiguity problem
                <a class='info' href='#Zh86'>[Zh86]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Zhang, L., &ldquo;Why TCP Timers Don't Work Well,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1986.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#KP87'>[KP87]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Karn, P. and C. Partridge, &ldquo;Improving Round-Trip Time Estimates in Reliable                         Transport Protocols,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a> is the TCP sender's
                inability to distinguish whether the first acceptable ACK after
                a retransmission refers to the original transmission or the
                retransmission. This problem occurs after both a Fast
                Retransmit and a timeout-based retransmit. However, modern TCP
                implementations can eliminate the retransmission ambiguity with
                either the help of Eifel <a class='info' href='#RFC3522'>[RFC3522]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ludwig, R. and M. Meyer, &ldquo;The Eifel Detection Algorithm for TCP,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>,
                <a class='info' href='#RFC4015'>[RFC4015]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ludwig, R. and A. Gurtov, &ldquo;The Eifel Response Algorithm for TCP,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> or Forward RTO-Recovery (F-RTO)
                <a class='info' href='#RFC5682'>[RFC5682]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Sarolahti, P., Kojo, M., Yamamoto, K., and M. Hata, &ldquo;Forward RTO-Recovery (F-RTO): An Algorithm for Detecting Spurious Retransmission Timeouts with TCP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The revert strategy of the given algorithm suffers from a
                form of retransmission ambiguity, too. In contrast to the
                aforementioned case, TCP suffers from ambiguity regarding ICMP
                unreachable messages received during timeout-based loss
                recovery. With the TCP segment number included in the ICMP
                unreachable message, a TCP sender is not able to determine if
                the ICMP unreachable message refers to the original
                transmission or to any of the timeout-based retransmissions.
                That is, there is an ambiguity which TCP segment, i.e., the
                original transmission or any of the retransmissions an ICMP
                unreachable message reports on.
</p>
<p>However, for the algorithm the ambiguity is not considered
                to be a problem. The assumption that a received ICMP message
                provides evidence that one non-congestion loss caused by the
                connectivity disruption was wrongly considered a congestion
                loss still holds, regardless to which TCP segment, transmission
                or retransmission the message refers.

Wrapped Sequence Numbers</h3>

<p>Besides the ambiguity if a received ICMP unreachable message
                refers to the original transmission or to any of the
                retransmissions, there is another source of ambiguity about the
                TCP sequence numbers contained in ICMP unreachable messages.
                For high bandwidth paths like modern gigabit links the sequence
                space may wrap rather quickly, thereby allowing the possibility
                that delayed ICMP unreachable messages - a router dropping
                packets due to a link outage is not obliged to send ICMP
                unreachable messages in a timely manner <a class='info' href='#RFC1812'>[RFC1812]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., &ldquo;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a>
                - may coincidentally fit as valid input in the proposed scheme.
                As a result, the scheme may undo retransmission timer backoffs
                wrongly. Chances for this to happen are minuscule, since a
                particular ICMP message would need to contain the exact
                sequence number of the current oldest outstanding segment
                (SND.UNA), while at the same time TCP is in timeout-based loss
                recovery. However, two "worst case" scenarios for the algorithm
                are possible:
</p>
<p>For instance, consider a steady state TCP connection, which
                will be disrupted at an intermediate router R due to a link
                outage. Upon the expiration of the RTO, the TCP sender enters
                the timeout-based loss recovery and starts to retransmit the
                earliest segment that has not been acknowledged (SND.UNA). For
                any reason, router R delays all corresponding ICMP unreachable
                messages, so that the TCP sender backoffs the retransmission
                timer normally without any undoing. At the end of the
                connectivity disruption, the TCP sender eventually detects the
                re-establishment, leaves the scheme and finally the
                timeout-based loss recovery, too. A sequence number wrap-around
                later, the connectivity between the two peers is disrupted
                again, but this time due to congestion and exactly at the time
                at which the current SND.UNA matches the SND.UNA from the
                previous cycle. If router R emits the delayed ICMP unreachable
                messages now, the TCP sender would undo retransmission timer
                backoffs wrongly. As the TCP sequence number contains 32 bits,
                the probability of this scenario is at most 1/2^32. Given
                sufficiently many retransmissions in the first timeout-based
                loss recovery, the corresponding ICMP unreachable messages
                could reduce the RTO in the second recovery at most to
                "RTO_BASE".  However, once the ICMP unreachable messages are
                depleted, the standard exponential backoff will be performed.
                Thus, the congestion response will only be delayed by some
                false retransmissions.
</p>
<p>Similar to the above, consider the case where a steady state
                TCP connection with n segments in-flight will be disrupted at
                some point by an intermediate router R due to a link outage.
                For each segment in-flight, router R may generates an ICMP
                unreachable message, however due to some reason it delays them.
                Once the link outage is over and the connection is
                re-established, the TCP sender leaves the scheme and
                slow-starts the connection. Following a sequence number
                wrap-around, a retransmission timeout occurs, just at the
                moment the TCP sender's current window of data reaches the
                previous range of the sequence number space again.  In case
                router R emits the delayed ICMP unreachable messages now, one
                spurious undoing of the retransmission timer backoff is
                possible, if firstly the TCP segment number contained in ICMP
                unreachable messages matches the current SND.UNA, and secondly
                the timeout was a result of congestion. In the case of another
                connectivity disruption, the additional undoing of the
                retransmission timer backoff has no impact. The probability of
                this scenario is at most n/2^32.

Packet Duplication</h3>

<p>In the case an intermediate router duplicates packets, a TCP
                sender may receive more ICMP unreachable messages during
                timeout-based loss recovery than it actually has sent
                timeout-based retransmissions. However, since TCP-LCD keeps
                track of the number of performed retransmission timer backoffs
                in the "BACKOFF_CNT" variable, it will not undo more
                retransmission timer backoffs than were actually performed.
                Nevertheless, if packet duplication and congestion coincide on
                the path between the two communicating hosts, duplicated ICMP
                messages could hide the congestion loss of some retransmissions
                or ICMP messages and the algorithm may undo retransmission
                timer backoffs wrongly. Considering the overall impact of a
                router that duplicates packets, the additional load induced
                by some spurious timeout-based retransmits can probably be
                neglected.

Probing Frequency</h3>

<p>One could argue that if an ICMP unreachable message arrives
                for a timeout-based retransmission, the RTO should be reset or
                recalculated similar to what is done when an ACK arrives during
                timeout-based loss recovery (see Karn's algorithm
                <a class='info' href='#KP87'>[KP87]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Karn, P. and C. Partridge, &ldquo;Improving Round-Trip Time Estimates in Reliable                         Transport Protocols,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>[RFC2988]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M.

                retransmission should be sent immediately. Generally, this
                would allow for a much higher probing frequency based on the
                round trip time up to the router where the connectivity is
                disrupted. However, we believe the current scheme provides a
                good trade-off between conservative behavior and fast detection
                of connectivity re-establishment.

Reaction in Steady-State</h3>

<p>Another exploitation of ICMP unreachable messages in the
                context of TCP congestion control might seem appropriate in
                case the ICMP unreachable message is received while TCP is in
                steady-state and the message refers to a segment from within
                the current window of data. As the RTT up to the router, which
                generates the ICMP unreachable message is likely to be
                substantially shorter than the overall RTT to the destination,
                the ICMP unreachable message may very well reach the
                originating TCP while it is transmitting the current window of
                data. In case the remaining window is large, it might seem
                appropriate to refrain from transmitting the remaining window
                as there is timely evidence that it will only trigger further
                ICMP unreachable messages at the very router. Although this
                promises improvement from a wastage perspective, it may be
                counterproductive from a security perspective. An attacker
                could forge such ICMP messages, thereby forcing the originating
                TCP to stop sending data, very similar to the blind
                throughput-reduction attack mentioned in
                <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tcpm-icmp-attacks'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tcpm&#8209;icmp&#8209;attacks]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gont, F., &ldquo;ICMP attacks against TCP,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>An additional consideration is the following: in the presence
                of multi-path routing even the receipt of a legitimate ICMP
                unreachable message cannot be exploited accurately because
                there is the option that only one of the multiple paths to the
                destination is suffering from a connectivity disruption, which
                causes ICMP unreachable messages to be sent. Then however,
                there is the possibility that the path along which the
                connectivity disruption occurred contributed considerably to
                the overall bandwidth, such that a congestion response is very
                well reasonable. However, this is not necessarily the case.
                Therefore, a TCP has no means except for its inherent
                congestion control to decide on this matter. All in all, it
                seems that for a connection in steady-state, i.e., not in
                timeout-based loss recovery, reacting on ICMP unreachable
                messages in regard to congestion control is not appropriate.
                For the case of timeout-based retransmissions, however, there
                is a reasonable congestion response, which is skipping further
                retransmission timer backoffs because there is no congestion
                indication - as described above.

Dissolving Ambiguity Issues (the Safe&nbsp;Variant)</h3>

<p>Given that the TCP Timestamps option
            <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-tcpm-1323bis'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;tcpm&#8209;1323bis]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Borman, D., Braden, R., and V. Jacobson, &ldquo;TCP Extensions for High Performance,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> is enabled for a
            connection, a TCP sender MAY use the following algorithm to
            dissolve the ambiguity issues mentioned in Sections
            <a class='info' href='#discuss_retrans_ambiguity'>5.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Retransmission Ambiguity</span><span>)</span></a>,

            and <a class='info' href='#discuss_packet_dup'>5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Packet Duplication</span><span>)</span></a>. In
            particular both the retransmission ambiguity and the packet
            duplication problems are prevented by the following TCP-LCD
            variant. On the other hand, the false positives caused by wrapped
            sequence numbers can not be completely avoided, but the likelihood
            is further reduced by a factor of 1/2^32 since the Timestamp Value
            field (TSval) of the TCP Timestamps Option contains 32 bits.
</p>
<p>Hence, implementers may choose to implement the TCP-LCD with the
            following modifications.

<dd> If "SEG.SEQ == SND.UNA &&

                    carries the sequence number of a retransmission and the
                    value in its Timestamp Value field (TSval) is valid, then
                        
<blockquote class="text">

<p>The downside of the safe variant is twofold. Firstly, the
            modifications come at a cost: the TCP sender is required to store
            the timestamps of all retransmissions sent during one timeout-based
            loss recovery. Secondly, the safe variant can only undo a
            retransmission timer backoff, if the intermediate router
            experiencing the link outage implements <a class='info' href='#RFC1812'>[RFC1812]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Baker, F., &ldquo;Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a>
            and chooses to include as many more than the first 64 bits of the
            payload of the triggering datagram, as are needed to include the
            TCP Timestamps option in the ICMP unreachable message.

Detection of TCP Connection Failures</h3>

<p>TCP-LCD may have side-effects on TCP implementations, which
                attempt to detect TCP connection failures by counting
                timeout-based retransmissions. <a class='info' href='#RFC1122'>RFC&nbsp;1122<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, R., &ldquo;Requirements for Internet Hosts - Communication Layers,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1989.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC1122] states in Section 4.2.3.5 that a TCP host
                must handle excessive retransmissions of data segments with two
                thresholds R1 and R2 measuring the amount of retransmission
                that has occurred for the same segment. Both thresholds might
                either be measured in time units or as a count of
                retransmissions.
</p>
<p>Due to TCP-LCD's revert strategy of the retransmission timer,
                the assumption that a certain number of retransmissions
                corresponds to a specific time interval no longer holds true,
                as additional retransmissions may be performed during
                timeout-based-loss recovery to detect the end of the
                connectivity disruption. Therefore, a TCP employing TCP-LCD
                either SHOULD measure the thresholds R1 and R2 in time units or
                in case R1 and R2 are counters of retransmissions SHOULD
                convert them into time intervals, which correspond to the time
                an unmodified TCP would need to reach the specified number of
                retransmissions.

Explicit Congestion Notification</h3>

                ECN-capable routers are no longer limited to dropping packets
                as congestion indication. Instead they can set the Congestion
                Experienced (CE) codepoint in the IP header of packets to
                indicate congestion. Concerning TCP-LCD there is the
                option that during a connectivity disruption a received ICMP
                unreachable message has been elicited by a timeout-based
                retransmission that was marked with the CE codepoint before
                reaching the router experiencing the link outage. In such a
                case, we suggest in the case the algorithm undoes a
                retransmission timer backoff, the TCP sender SHOULD
                additionally reset the retransmission timer.

                From TCP-LCD's point of view, it is important to notice that
                for IPv6, the payload of an ICMPv6 error messages has to
                include as many bytes from the IPv6 datagram that elicited the
                ICMPv6 error message as possible without making the error
                message exceed the minimum IPv6 MTU (1280 bytes)
                <a class='info' href='#RFC4443'>[RFC4443]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Conta, A., Deering, S., and M.

Thus, more information is available
                for TCP-LCD as in the case of IPv4.
</p>
<p>The counterpart of the ICMPv4 destination unreachable
                message of code 0 (net unreachable) and of code 1 (host
                unreachable) is the ICMPv6 destination unreachable message of
                code 0 (no route to destination) <a class='info' href='#RFC4443'>[RFC4443]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Conta, A., Deering, S., and M.

                Like the IPv4 case, a router should generate an ICMPv6
                destination unreachable message of code 0 in response to a
                packet that cannot be delivered to its destination address
                because it lacks a matching entry in its routing table. As a
                result, TCP-LCD can employ this ICMPv6 error messages as
                connectivity disruption indication, too.

                receive ICMP unreachable messages, where additional steps,
                e.g., decrypting in step (5) of the algorithm is needed to
                extract the TCP header from these ICMP messages. Provided that

                ingress node may replay the ICMP unreachable messages in order

<p>In literature there are several methods that address TCP's
            problems in the presence of connectivity disruptions. Some of them
            try to improve TCP's performance by modifying lower layers. For
            example <a class='info' href='#SM03'>[SM03]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Scott, J. and G. Mapp, &ldquo;Link layer-based TCP optimisation for disconnecting                         networks,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> introduces a "smart link layer", which
            buffers one segment for each active connection and replaying these
            segments on connectivity re-establishment. This approach has a
            serious drawback: previously stateless intermediate routers have
            to be modified in order to inspect TCP headers, to track the
            end-to-end connection and to provide additional buffer space. These
            lead all in all to an additional need of memory and processing
            power.
</p>
<p>On the other hand stateless link layer schemes, like proposed in
            <a class='info' href='#RFC3819'>[RFC3819]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Karn, P., Bormann, C., Fairhurst, G., Grossman, D., Ludwig, R., Mahdavi, J., Montenegro, G., Touch, J., and L.

            inform a TCP sender about a disrupted path by special messages
            generated and sent from intermediate routers. In case of a link
            failure the TCP sender stops sending segments and freezes its
            retransmission timers. TCP-F stays in this state and remains silent
            until either a "route establishment notification" is received or an
            internal timer expires. In contrast, ELFN periodically probes the
            network to detect connectivity re-establishment. Both proposals
            rely on changes to intermediate routers, whereas the scheme
            proposed in this document is a sender-only modification. Moreover,
            ELFN does not consider congestion and may impose serious additional
            load on the network, depending on the probe interval.

<p>The authors of ATCP <a class='info' href='#LS01'>[LS01]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Liu, J. and S. Singh, &ldquo;ATCP: TCP for mobile ad hoc networks,&rdquo; 2001&nbsp;July.</span><span>)</span></a> propose enhancements
            to identify different types of packet loss by introducing a layer
            between TCP and IP. They utilize ICMP destination unreachable
            messages to set TCP's receiver advertised window to zero and thus
            forcing the TCP sender to perform zero window probing with a
            exponential backoff. ICMP destination unreachable messages, which
            arrive during this probing period, are ignored. This approach is
            nearly orthogonal to this document, which exploits ICMP messages to
            undo a retransmission timer backoff when TCP is already probing. In
            principle both mechanisms could be combined, however, due to security

            option to signal locally received connectivity-change indications
            (CCIs) to remote peers. Upon reception of a CCI, they re-probe the
            path characteristics either by performing a speculative
            retransmission or by sending a single segment of new data, depending
            on whether the connection is currently stalled in exponential

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>The algorithm proposed in this document is considered to be
            secure. For example an attacker, who already guessed the correct
            four-tuple (i.e., Source IP Address, Source TCP port, Destination
            IP Address, and Destination TCP port), can still not make a TCP
            modified with TCP-LCD to flood the network just by sending forged
            ICMP unreachable messages in an attempt to maliciously shorten the
            retransmission timer. The attacker additionally would need to guess
            the correct segment sequence number of the current timeout-based
            retransmission, with a probability of at most 1/2^32. Even in the
            case of man-in-the-middle attacks, i.e., attacks performed in
            scenarios in which the attacker can sniff the retransmissions, the
            impact on network load is considered to be low, since the
            retransmission frequency is limited by the RTO that was computed
            before TCP has entered the timeout-based loss recovery. Hence, the
            highest probing frequency is expected to be even lower than once
            per minimum RTO, i.e. 1s as specified by
            <a class='info' href='#RFC2988'>[RFC2988]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Paxson, V. and M. Allman, &ldquo;Computing TCP's Retransmission Timer,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>.

                        retransmission timer backoff by halving the RTO, the
                        RTO is recalculated with help of the "BACKOFF_CNT"
                        variable. This fixes an issue that occurred when the
                        retransmission timer was backed off but bounded by a
                        maximum value. The algorithm in the previous version of
                        the draft, would have "reverted" to half of that
                        maximum value, instead of using the value, before the
                        RTO was doubled (and then bounded).

<li>Miscellaneous editorial changes in Section

<li>The document was restructured in Section
                        <a class='info' href='#terminology'>1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Terminology</span><span>)</span></a>,
                        <a class='info' href='#intro'>2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Introduction</span><span>)</span></a> and
                        <a class='info' href='#cdi'>3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Connectivity Disruption Indication</span><span>)</span></a> for easier
                        reading. The motivation for the algorithm is changed
                        according TCP's problem to disambiguate congestion from
                        non-congestion loss.
</li>
<li>Added <a class='info' href='#alg_idea'>Section&nbsp;4.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Basic Idea</span><span>)</span></a>.
</li>
<li>The algorithm in <a class='info' href='#alg'>Section&nbsp;4.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Algorithm Details</span><span>)</span></a> was
                        restructured and simplified:
                            
<ul class="text">
<li>The special case of the first received ICMP
                                destination unreachable message after an RTO was
                                removed.
</li>
<li>The "BACKOFF_CNT" variable was introduced so
                                it is no longer possible to perform more reverts
                                than backoffs.
</li>
</ul>
                        
</li>
<li>The discussion in <a class='info' href='#discussion'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Discussion of TCP-LCD</span><span>)</span></a> was
                        improved and expanded according to the algorithm
                        changes.
