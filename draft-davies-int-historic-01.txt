                Deprecating infrastructure "int" domains
                      draft-davies-int-historic-01

Abstract

   The document marks as historic any "int" domain names that were
   designated for infrastructure purposes, and identifies them for
   removal from the "int" top-level domain.  Any implementation that
   involves these domains should be considered deprecated.  This
   document also updates [RFC1591] by removing the documented use of
   "int" for international databases.

1.  Introduction

   The "int" top-level domain [RFC1591] is a specialized domain
   designated for intergovernmental organizations, which are
   organizations established by international treaties between or among
   national governments.

   Historically, the "int" domain was also used for Internet
   infrastructure related purposes.  This practice ended in 2001 when
   the "arpa" domain was declared the appropriate home for
   infrastructural identifier spaces [RFC3172].  In conjunction with
   this change, the eligibility for "int" domains was limited to only
   intergovernmental treaty organizations.

   The documented uses of infrastructural identifiers in the "int"
   domain were largely experimental and in practice obsolete.  This
   document formalizes moving the related specifications to historic
   status, along with removing any associated delegations from the "int"
   zone in the domain name system.

2.  Historical infrastructural uses

   The following domains were used for infrastructural identifier
   purposes that are now considered historic.  Although each of these
   names was either delegated or documented at one time, the parties
   administering them have long since stopped using them.

2.1.  atma.int

   The atma.int domain was experimentally defined to implement address
   lookups for Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), including ATM End
   System Addresses (AESAs).  [ANS]

2.2.  ip4.int

   The ip4.int domain was described as providing an alternative to in-
   addr.arpa domain for mapping host IPv4 addresses to host names.  The
   in-addr.arpa domain zone continues to be administered for this
   purpose [RFC1035].

   The ip6.int domain was similarly delegated, and subsequently removed
   from the "int" zone, having been replaced by ip6.arpa for the purpose
   of mapping host IPv6 addresses to host names [RFC4159].

2.3.  nsap.int

   The nsap.int domain name was specified to experimentally map Open
   Systems Interconnection (OSI) Network Service Access Points to domain
   names [RFC1706].

2.4.  rdi.int

   The rdi.int domain name experimentally mapped OSI Inter-Domain
   Routing Protocol's Routing Domain Identifiers [ISO10747] to the
   domain name system.

2.5.  reg.int

   The reg.int domain name hosted an experimental mechanism for
   publishing IANA registration values in the domain name system.

2.6.  tpc.int

   The tpc.int domain name hosted an experimental remote printing
   service that served as a gateway between Internet mail and facsimile
   transmission [RFC1528].

3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA shall coordinate the removal of any of the historical "int"
   domains discussed in this document that are still delegated in the
   "int" zone.

4.  Security Considerations

   Some old systems might have one or more subdomains of these names
   hardwired and expect a positive response for at least the second-
   level domain.  This is, of course, true for any name in the DNS and
   should not be the sole basis to retain obsolete names.

   Existing applications should eliminate any reliance upon these zones
   for their historic purpose.  The operator of the "int" domain should
   be cautious about any potential re-use of these domains for
   intergovernmental treaty organizations.

5.  Additional Information

   This document is the result of an comprehensive inventory conducted
   by the IANA team of .int domains to accurately establish and record
   their purpose based on historical documentation.  Following this
   review, the remaining domains delegated for infrastructure identifier
   related purposes were reviewed.  As part of this review, query

   patterns in the DNS were analyzed and judged to be insignificant.
   The assessment concluded that these domains are highly likely to be
   obsolete and this document is intended to formalize that assessment.

   There are a small number of existing "int" domains nominally for
   "international databases" that are not defined by any standards
   documentation, and are assigned to entities rather than for an
   identifier purpose.  While they would not qualify for a "int" domain
   under current criteria, their disposition is beyond the scope of this
   memo.
