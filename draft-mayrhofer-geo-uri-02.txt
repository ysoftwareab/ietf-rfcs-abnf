Abstract

   This document specifies an Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for
   geographic areas using the 'geo' scheme name.  A 'geo' URI provides a
   compact, human-readable, and protocol independent way to identify an
   area by means of a hierarchical tiling scheme.

2.  Introduction

   The use of spatial location in internet technology has gained
   significant importance over the last few years.  More and more
   protocols and data formats are being extended to carry spatial
   information, most prominently geographic location.

   Most of those specifications are optimized for machine readability,
   capable of carrying complex location information (and are therefore
   complex by themselves), or are tied to a specific protocol or data
   format.  On the contrary, the success of domain names, URIs and
   telephone numbers indicates that there is a demand for conveying
   simple, concise identity information by a variety of "manual" means
   between humans.

   This document aims at specifying such a simple, concise identifier
   for geographic location using a hierarchical tiling scheme.  It is
   intended to coexist with and support existing "machine-readable"
   location information schemes.

   According to [RFC3986], a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) "is a
   compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or
   physical resource".  The URI scheme specified in this document (using
   the 'geo' scheme name) identifies such a physical resource (a
   geographic area) in a compact, human-readable, and protocol
   idependent way.

   The URI scheme specified in this document uses only geographic
   coordinates - the provision of civic addresses to identify locations
   is out of scope of this document.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition this document uses the following terminology:
   o  area bitstring: A string of bits, describing a geographic tile
      according to Section 6.
   o  tile identifier: A base32 encoded string containing an area
      bitstring, padding and parity information, as described in
      Section 7.


4.  Requirements

   (Note: Earlier versions of this document proposed URIs in the form of
   "geo:<latitude>,<longitude>".  Feedback from the GEOPRIV working
   group indicated that this format does not seem to fulfill some of the
   requirements mentioned during the presentation.  Requirements are
   therefore clarified in this section).

   The IETF has already produced several specifications in the area of
   encoding and conveying geographical location (RFC 4119, RFC 3825, RFC
   4776).  However, none of those schemes specifically focuses on
   conveying geographic location identification among humans or between
   humans and machines (for example, for user input into a device).

   Identifiers handled by humans are considered to have the following
   requirements:
   o  Interopability: Good identifiers are not limited to an
      administrative domain, but are universally usable and recognized.
      They have a clear public specification that allows anybody to
      create, encode, decode and dereference identifier instances, and
      they are easily distinguished from other identifier spaces.  URI
      schemes are an example of such an identifier scheme.
   o  Length: Good identifiers are as short as possible.  Such
      identifiers require less time to read, write and spell them.  The
      probability of "transmission errors" such as mistyped, missing, or
      flipped characters is proportional to the length of an identifier.
   o  Character set: Good identifiers use a limited character set, which
      reduces the risk of confusing two similar characters.  A good
      character set is also globally recognized.
   o  Ambigiuity: Good identifiers have little ambigiuity.
   o  Recognition: Good identifiers allow recognizing rough "similarity"
      among a set of identifiers (for example, domain names below the
      same top level domain, phone numbers within the same area or
      network, email addresses within the same domain name).  Such

      identifiers allow a quick "categorization" even by humans.
   o  Error detection: Good identifiers provide basic error detection,
      for example a mistyped identifier can at least be recognized as
      invalid.


5.  IANA Registration of 'geo' URI Scheme

   This section contains the fields required for the URI scheme
   registration, following the guidelines in section 5.4 of [RFC4395].

5.1.  URI Scheme Name

   geo

5.2.  Status

   permanent

5.3.  URI Scheme Syntax

   The syntax of the 'geo' URI scheme is specified below in Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC4234]:

             geo-URI        = geo-scheme ":" geo-tile-id \
                              [ *("." geo-extension) ]

             geo-scheme     = "geo"
             geo-tile-id    = 2*32( ALPHA / base32-digits )
             base32-digits  = "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7"

             geo-extension  = *(ALPHA / DIGITS / "-" / "," )

   "geo-tile-id" and "geo-extension" are specified in section
   Section 5.4.1.

   (Note: The "geo-extension" component is under discussion, perspective
   extensions are currently worked on.  The authors seek feedback
   whether an extension mechanism is considered useful)

5.4.  URI Scheme Semantics

   Data contained in a 'geo' URI identifies a physical resource, namely
   the geographic coordinates of a spatial area on Earth in the World
   Geodetic System 1984 [WGS84] datum / reference system.

Internet-Draft              'geo' URI scheme                    Feb 2008


5.4.1.  Component Description

   The "geo-tile-id" component of the URI contains a tile-identifier
   (Base32 encoded), as specified in section Section 6.  The
   "geo-tile-id" component is case-insensitive.

   The "geo-extension" component is currently not specified, but
   applications should be prepared to receive URI instances with such
   components.  Applications should ignore the "geo-extension" for now.
   The "geo-extension" components may be used in future revisions of the
   specification to further narrow down the area identified.

   Note: An application MAY attempt to recover a mistyped geo-tile-path
   component by replacing the digit "0" (zero) with the character "o",
   the digit "1" (one) with "i" and the digit "8" with "B" (even though
   those character may not occur in that component).  No replacement
   SHOULD be attempted for the digit "9" or any character not listed.
   An application SHOULD also strip any whitespace from the input string
   before decoding a geo URI.

5.4.2.  URI Comparison

   Two 'geo' URIs are equal when their lowercased "geo-tile-id"
   components are identical, and they contain identical lowercased "geo-
   extension" components in identical order.

5.5.  Properties of the URI scheme

   The described URI scheme provides the following properties:
   o  URI instances are very short compared to other textual methods to
      convey location - a 'geo' URI with a just 8 character long tile-
      identifier (including padding and parity) already identifies an
      area of approximately 150 x 150 meters (in the worst case, close
      to the equator).  An instance with 12 characters of tile-
      identifier identifies an area of about 0.3 x 0.3 meters.
   o  By decoding 'geo' URIs while typing, applications can provide
      rough results to the user even before the full URI has been
      entered.  Whenever the user types another character of the tile-
      identifier, the application can "zoom in" further.
   o  It's easy to guess the approximate "scale" of a 'geo' URI by
      looking at the length of the tile-identifier, much like numbers.
   o  The choice of Base32 encoding provides a character set that is
      well known by almost all internet users, since it's a subset of
      the characters used in Domain Names.
   o  The parity information provides a mechanism to recognize most
      mistyped URIs without external information.

Internet-Draft              'geo' URI scheme                    Feb 2008


   o  'geo' URIs can be visually compared.  URIs with similar prefixes
      reflect areas that are spatially nearby.
   o  Instances of 'geo' URIs are easy to read, spell and write, because
      the use of special characters has been deliberately limited.

   (Note: the current specification does not consider altitude - the
   authors seek feedback whether that specification should be extended
   to 3 dimensions)

5.6.  Applications/protocols That Use This URI Scheme

   The 'geo' URI provides resource identification independent of a
   specific application or protocol.  Examples of potential protocol
   mappings and use cases can be found in Section 8.

5.7.  Interopability Considerations

   Applications MAY generate tile-identifiers using either lowercase or
   uppercase characters during Base32 encoding, but SHOULD NOT mix
   lowercase and uppercase characters in a single URI instance.
   Applications MUST be able to decode URI instances with upper-, lower
   as well as mixed case characters.

   FIXME: accept geo URIs with "wrong" padding bits?

5.8.  Security Considerations

   tree.  As such, change control is up to the IETF.

6.  The Tile Hierarchy

   The "tile-identifier" of the 'geo' URI uses a hierarchical scheme to
   tile an equirectangular projection of Earth's surface into
   rectangular tiles.

   Tiling starts with a global plate carree (longitude ranging from 180
   degrees west to 180 degrees east, and latitude ranging from 90
   degrees north to 90 degrees south).  The WGS 84 reference system and
   datum is used.  Such a plate carree reflects an empty area bitstring,
   and can be illustrated as follows:

      -180                      0                     +180
    +90 +-----------------------------------------------+
        |                                               |
        |                                               |
        |                                               |
        |                                               |
        |                                               |
      0 |                                               |
        |                                               |
        |                                               |
        |                                               |
        |                                               |
        |                                               |
    -90 +-----------------------------------------------+

   The first tiling step splits that area vertically, into two aras of
   (-180 to 0 longitude / +90 to -90 latitude) and (0 to 180 longitude /
   +90 to -90 latitude), respectively.  The "left" area is assigned a
   binary 0, and the "right" area is assigned a binary 1, as illustrated
   below:

      -180                      0                     +180

        |                       |                       |
        |                       |                       |
        |                       |                       |

   A subsequent tiling step involves splitting each of the areas
   vertically, resulting in a total number of 4 tiles.  To identify a
   sub-tile in this step, a binary 0 is appended to the area bitstring
   of each individual "upper" tile, and a binary 1 to the "lower" tile:

      -180                      0                     +180
    +90 +-----------------------+-----------------------+

        |                       |                       |
      0 +-----------------------+-----------------------+
        |                       |                       |
        |                       |                       |
        |          01           |          11           |
        |                       |                       |
        |                       |                       |
    -90 +-----------------------+-----------------------+

   From now on, vertical and horizontal splitting is continued until the
   desired resolution is achieved, recursively tiling the whole range of
   coordinates into smaller areas.  Whenever a "sub-area" is split, the
   new "left" (or "upper") area is identified by appending a binary 0 to
   the area string , and the new "right" (or "lower") area is identified
   by appending a binary 1 to the area bitstring.  After another
   repetition of a vertical split, the areas look like this:

      -180                      0                     +180

   Those splitting steps can be repeated as long until the desired size
   of the area to be identified is reached.  Tiling MUST always be
   initiated with a vertical split.  After a vertical split, the next
   split MUST be a horizontal split.  After a horizontal split, the next
   split MUST be a vertical split, etc..

   The resulting area bitstring is used in encoding tile identifiers
   (see Section 7).

   Note that area bitstrings can be obviously calculated directly as
   well - the above "splitting" procedure is considered to have
   illustrative value.

7.  Encoding of Tile Identifiers

   A "geo" URI contains base32 encoded tile identifiers.  This section
   describes how to transform area bitstrings into their Base32
   representation.

7.1.  Area Bitstring Padding

   Since tiling as outlined above may be stopped at any "resolution",
   area bitstrings may have arbitrary numbers of binary digits, and
   therefore not fit into the 5-bit boundaries of Base32.  The following
   process MUST be followed to pad area bitstrings to multiples of 5 bit
   (the example uses an area bitstring of 12 bits):
   1.  Identify number of significant bits in area bitstrings (void bits
       are illustrated as dots below):

                  01011 10100 11...  (12 significant bits)
         area id: --------------

   2.  Pad area bitstring to the next 5-bit border with "0" bits, and
       record the number of padding bits used in "padding-counter":

                  01011 10100 11000  (total lenght: 15 bit)
         area id: --------------
         padding:               ---  (padding-counter: 3)

   (Note that after padding, the number of significant bit cannot be
   recovered from the padded area bitstring without the padding-
   counter).

7.2.  Appending Padding Counter and Parity Bits

   To recover the number of significant bits in the resulting URI
   string, the binary representation of padding-counter is appended to
   the padded area bitstring.  Since the padding size is between 0 and 4
   bits, 3 bits are required to encode padding-counter.

                  01011 10100 11000 011  (padding-counter: 3)
         area id: --------------
         padding:               ---
         padding-counter:           ---

   The encoded padding-counter of 3 bits always leaves 2 bits of "free
   space" in the last 5 bit group.  Those 2 bits are used for parity
   bits, which are calculated as follows:
   o  The first parity bit (A) is used to convey even parity over the
      "longitude" bits




Mayrhofer & Spanring     Expires August 18, 2008               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft              'geo' URI scheme                    Feb 2008


   o  The second parity bit (B) is used to convey even parity for the
      "latitude" bits

                  01011 10100 11000 01100
         area id: ----- ----- --
     parity bits:                      --
   longitude bit: 0 0 1  0 0  1        0  (parity bit A - longitude)
    latitude bit:  1 1  1 1 0  0        0 (parity bit B - latitude)

   Note that padding bits MUST NOT be included in parity calculation
   (the use of '0' bits for padding does not affect parity anyways,
   however, mangled URI instances could contain '1's in padding).

7.3.  Final Base32 Encoding

   The bitstream resulting from the operations above (including the
   significance / parity bits) is Base32 encoded according to section 5
   of [RFC3548].

             Bitstream: 01011 10100 11000 01100
             Decimal:      11    20    24    12
             Base32:        L     U     Y     M

   Therefore, the final base32 encoded tile identifier is "LUYM".  That
   string is to be used in the "geo-tile-id" component of the URI (see
   Section 5.3).


8.  Example

   The following 'geo' URI identifies a geographic area that resembles
   the square in front of one of the author's office:
   o  Center coordinates (approx.): 48.200179 latitude, 16.367957
      longitude.
   o  Number of tiling steps: 34
   o  Area bitstring: 1000010111001111100111010000111011
   o  Geographic coordinates of respective area: 48.1997680664 to
      48.2011413574 degrees north, 16.3668823242 to 16.3696289062
      degrees east ( approximately 150 x 300 meters).
   o  Area bitstring padded:

             10000 10111 00111 11001 11010 00011 10110
                                                     =

   o  Area bitstring with padding-counter (1 bit padding):

             10000 10111 00111 11001 11010 00011 10110 001
                                                       ===

   o  Adding parity bits:

             10000 10111 00111 11001 11010 00011 10110 00110
                                                          ==
        lon: 1 0 0  0 1  0 1 1  1 0  1 0 0  0 1  1 1 0 -> 1
        lat:  0 0  1 1 1  0 1  1 0 1  1 1  0 0 1  0 1  --> 0

   o  Base32 encoding:

             10000 10111 00111 11001 11010 00011 10110 00110
               Q     X     H     Z     2     D     W     G

   o  Resulting 'geo' URI:

             geo:QXHZ2DWG


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests assignment of the 'geo' URI scheme in the IETF
   part of the URI scheme tree, according to the guidelines in BCP 115
   (RFC 4395) [RFC4395].  The definitions required for the assignment
   are contained in Section 5.


10.  Security Considerations

   Because the 'geo' URI is not tied to any specific protocol, and
   identifies a physical area rather than an abstract resource, most of
   the general security considerations on URIs (Section 7 of RFC 3986)
   do not apply.

   Instances of 'geo' URIs convey location information.  Such location
   information may be publicly known, and therefore not be very
   sensitive (for example, 'geo' URIs conveying the location of public
   sights, hotels, etc.).  However, 'geo' URIs might be used in
   situations that have considerable privacy implications (for example,
   the current location of a person combined with Personally
   Identifieable Information).

   Therefore, security and privacy must be considered for individual use
   cases.
