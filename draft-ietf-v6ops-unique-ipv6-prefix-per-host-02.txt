                      Unique IPv6 Prefix Per Host
            draft-ietf-v6ops-unique-ipv6-prefix-per-host-02

Abstract

   In some IPv6 environments the need has arisen for hosts to be able to
   utilise a unique IPv6 prefix even though the link or media may be
   shared.  Typically hosts (subscribers) on a shared network, either
   wired or wireless, such as Ethernet, WiFi, etc., will acquire unique
   IPv6 addresses from a common IPv6 prefix that is allocated or
   assigned for use on a specific link.

   In most deployments today IPv6 address assignment from a single IPv6
   prefix on a shared network is done by either using IPv6 stateless
   address auto-configuration (SLAAC) and/or stateful DHCPv6.  While
   this is still viable and operates as designed there are some large
   scale environments where this concept introduces significant
   performance challenges and implications, specifically related to IPv6
   router and neighbor discovery.

   This document outlines an approach utilising existing IPv6 protocols
   to allow hosts to be assigned a unique IPv6 prefix (instead of a
   unique IPv6 address from a shared IPv6 prefix).  Benefits of a unique
   IPv6 prefix compared to a unique IPv6 address from the service
   provider are going from improved subscriber isolation to enhanced
   subscriber management.

1.  Introduction

   The concepts in this document are originally developed as part of a
   large scale, production deployment of IPv6 support for a provider
   managed shared network service.  In this document IPv6 support does
   not preclude support for IPv4, however, the primary objectives for
   this work was to make it so that user equipment (UE) were capable of
   an IPv6 only experience from a network operators perspective.  In the
   context of this document, UE can be a 'regular' end-user-equipment,
   as well as a server in a datacentre, assuming a shared network (wired
   or wireless).

   Details of IPv4 support are out of scope for this document.  This
   document will also, in general, outline the requirements that must be
   satified by UE to allow for an IPv6 only experience.

   In most deployments today User Equipment (UE) IPv6 address assignment
   is commonly done using either IPv6 SLAAC RFC4862 [RFC4862] and/or

   DHCP IA_NA RFC3315 [RFC3315].  During the time when this approach was
   developed and subsequently deployed it has been observed that some
   operating systems do not support the use of DHCPv6 for the
   acquisition of IA_NA per RFC7934 [RFC7934].  As such the use of IPv6
   SLAAC based subscriber and address management for provider managed
   shared network services is the recommended technology of choice as it
   does not exclude any known IPv6 implementation.  In addition an
   IA_NA-only network is not recommended per RFC 7934 RFC7934 [RFC7934]
   section 8.  This document will detail the mechanics involved for IPv6
   SLAAC based address and subscriber management coupled with stateless
   DHCPv6, where beneficial.

   This document will focus upon the process for UEs to obtain a unique
   IPv6 prefix.

2.  Motivation and Scope of Applicability

   The motivation for this work falls into the following categories:

   o  Deployment advice for IPv6 that will allow stable and secure IPv6
      only experience, even if IPv4 support is present

   o  Ensure support for IPv6 is efficient and does not impact the
      performance of the underlying network and in turn the customer
      experience

   o  Allow for the greatest flexibility across host implementation to
      allow for the widest range of addressing and configuration
      mechanisms to be employed.  The goal here is the ensure that the
      widest population of UE implementations can leverage the
      availability of IPv6

   o  Lay the technological foundation for future work related to the
      use of IPv6 over shared media requiring optimized subscriber
      management

   o  Two devices (subscriber/hosts), both attached to the same provider
      managed shared network should only be able to communicate through
      the provider managed First Hop Router

   o  Provide guidelines regarding best common practices around IPv6
      neighborship discovery and IPv6 address managent settings between
      the First Hop router and directly connected hosts/subscribers.

3.  Design Principles

   The First Hop router discussed in this document is the L3-Edge router
   responsible for the communication with the devices (hosts and
   subscribers) directly connected to a provider managed shared network,
   and to transport traffic between the directly connected devices and
   between directy connected devices and remote devices.

   The work detailed in this document is focussed to provide details
   regarding best common practices of the IPv6 neighborship discovery
   and related IPv6 address management settings between the First Hop
   router and directly connected hosts/subscribers.  The documented Best
   Current Practice helps a service provider to better manage the shared
   provider managed network on behalf of the connected devices.

   The Best Current Practice documented in this note is to provide
   hosts/subscribers devices connected to the provider managed shared
   network with a unique IPv6 prefix while at the same functioning as
   control-plane anchor point to make sure that each subscriber is
   receiving the expected subscriber policy and service levels
   (throughput, QoS, security, parental-control, subscriber mobility
   management, etc.).

4.  IPv6 Unique Prefix Assignment

   When a UE connects to the shared provider managed network and is
   attached it will initiate IP configuration phase.  During this phase
   the UE will from an IPv6 perspective attempt to learn the default
   IPv6 gateway, the IPv6 prefix information, the DNS information
   RFC6106 [RFC6106], and the remaining information required to
   establish globally routable IPv6 connectivity.  For that purpose the
   the UE/subscriber sends a RS (Router Solicitation) message.

   The First Hop Router receives this UE/subscriber RS message and
   starts the process to compose the response to the UE/subscriber
   originated RS message.  The First Hop Provider Router will answer
   using a unicast RA (Router Advertisement) to the UE/subscriber.  This
   RA contains a few important parameters for the EU/subscriber to
   consume: (1) a /64 prefix and (2) flags.  The /64 prefix can be
   derived from a locally managed pool or aggregate IPv6 block assigned
   to the First Hop Provider Router or from a centrally allocated pool.
   The flags indicate to the UE/subscriber to use SLAAC and/or DHCPv6
   for address assignment, it may indicate if the autoconfigured address
   is on/off-link and if 'Other' information (e.g.  DNS server address)
   needs to be requested.

   The IPv6 RA flags used for best common practice in IPv6 SLAAC based
   Provider managed shared networks are:

Internet-Draft         Unique IPv6 Prefix Per Host            March 2017


   o  M-flag = 0 (UE/subscriber address is not managed through DHCPv6),
      this flag may be set to 1 in the future if/when DHCPv6 prefix
      delegation support is desired)

   o  O-flag = 1 (DHCPv6 is used to request configuration information
      i.e. DNS, NTP information, not for IPv6 addressing)

   o  A-flag = 1 (The UE/subscriber can configure itself using SLAAC)

   o  L-flag = 0 (The UE/subscriber is off-link, which means that the
      UE/subscriber will ALWAYS send packets to its default gateway,
      even if the destination is within the range of the /64 prefix)

   The use of a unique IPv6 prefix per UE adds an additional level of
   protection and efficiency as it relates to how IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery and Router Discovery processing.  Since the UE has a unique
   IPv6 prefix all traffic by default will be directed to the First Hop
   provider router.  Further, the flag combinations documented above
   maximize the IPv6 configurations that are available by hosts
   including the use of privacy IPv6 addressing.

   The architected result of designing the RA as documented above is
   that each UE/subscriber gets its own unique /64 IPv6 prefix for which
   it can use SLAAC or any other method to select its /128 unique
   address.  In addition it will use stateless DHCPv6 to get the IPv6
   address of the DNS server, however it SHOULD NOT use stateful DHCPv6
   to receive a service provider managed IPv6 address.  If the UE/
   subscriber desires to send anything external including other UE/
   subscriber devices (assuming device to device communications is
   enabled and supported), then due to the L-bit set it SHOULD send this
   traffic to the First Hop Provider Router.

   Now that the UE/subscriber received the RA and the associated flags,
   it will assign itself a 128 bit IPv6 address using SLAAC.  Since the
   address is composed by the UE/subscriber device itself it will need
   to verify that the address is unique on the shared network.  The UE/
   subscriber will for that purpose perform Duplicate Address Detection
   algorithm.  This will occur for each address the UE attempts to
   utilize on the shared provider managed network.

5.  IPv6 Neighbourship Discovery Best Practices

   An operational consideration when using IPv6 address assignment using
   IPv6 SLAAC is that after the onboarding procedure the UE/subscriber
   will have a prefix with certain preferred and valid lifetimes.  The
   First Hop Provider Router extends these lifetimes by sending an
   unsolicited RA, the applicable MaxRtrAdvInterval on the first hop
   router MUST therefore be lower than the preferred lifetime.  As a

   consequence of this process is that the First Hop Router never knows
   when a UE/subscriber stops using addresses from a prefix and
   additional procedures are required to help the First Hop Router to
   gain this information.  When using stateful DHCPv6 IA_NA for IPv6 UE/
   subscriber address assignment this uncertainty on the First Hop
   Router is not of impact due to the stateful nature of DHCPv6 IA_NA
   address assignment.

   Following is reference table of the key IPv6 router discovery and
   neighbor discovery timers for provider managed shared networks:

   o  IPv6 Router Advertisement Interval = 300s

   o  IPv6 Router LifeTime = 3600s

   o  Reachable time = 30s

   o  IPv6 Valid Lifetime = 3600s

   o  IPv6 Preferred Lifetime = 1800s

   o  Retransmit timer = 0s

   The stateless nature of the UE/subscriber IPv6 SLAAC connectivity
   model provides value to make sure that the UE/subscriber context is
   timely removed from the First Hop Router to avoid ongoing resource
   depletion in the case of non-permanent UE, such as in the case of
   WiFi hotspots.  A possible solution is to use a subscriber inactivity
   timer which after tracking a pre-defined (currently unspecified) # of
   minutes deletes the subscriber context on the First Hop Router.

   When employing stateless IPv6 address assignment a number of widely
   deployed operating systems will attempt to utilize RFC 4941 RFC4941
   [RFC4941] temporary 'private' addresses.

   Similarly, when using this technology in a datacentre, the UE server
   may need to use several addresses from the same /64, for example
   because is using multiple virtual hosts, containers, etc. in the
   bridged virtual switch.  This can lead to the consequence that a UE
   has multiple /128 addresses from the same IPv6 prefix.  The First Hop
   Provider Router MUST be able to handle the presence and use of
   multiple globally routable IPv6 addresses.

   For accounting purposes the First Hop Provider Router must be able to
   send usage statistics per UE/subscriber using Radius attributes.
