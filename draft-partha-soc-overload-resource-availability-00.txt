 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Resource availability Event package
           draft-partha-soc-overload-resource-availability-00

Abstract

   Overload occurs in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) networks when
   B2BUA, proxies, and user agents have insufficient resources like CPU,
   memory, DSP, DS0, disk resources or available bandwidth to complete
   the processing of a request.  SIP provides limited support for
   overload handling through its 503 response code, which tells an
   upstream element that it is overloaded.  This document defines
   explicit SIP based resource monitoring and overload avoidance
   mechanism based on the resource availability of the entity.

Internet-Draft   SIP Resource availability Event package       June 2010


1.  Introduction

   In Voice/Video over IP (VoIP) network, Session Initiation protocol
   (SIP) [RFC3261] is widely deployed as a signaling protocol and
   overload occurs in the SIP network has limited support using 503
   response.  Overload is said to occur if a SIP server does not have
   sufficient resources to process all incoming SIP messages.  These
   resources include but not limited to CPU processing capacity,
   memory,DSP, DS0, available bandwidth, or disk resources.  Overload
   requirements for SIP are explained in [RFC5390].  Overload occurs at
   any time for either single or multiple resources and the duration of
   overload depends upon the type of the resource overloaded.  In case
   of CPU overload, when the number of incoming messages are reduced,
   then the system comes to normal situation in a short span of time
   whereas DS0/DSP resource overload with free CPU/Memory resource in
   system will come back to normal after the set of dialogs are
   terminated.  It is necessary for the system to understand its current
   resource capability and indicate to the neighboring entity in right
   time to avoid congestion collapse.

   For the signaling entity like proxy, lack of CPU or memory resource
   results in overload.  In case of PSTN-SIP gateway, the overload
   happens mostly because of non-availability of enough free DS0 or DSP
   resources.  For transcoding SIP entity, DSP resource is the
   bottleneck whereas for SIP recording server, the lack of disk
   resource results in overload.  Available bandwidth is an indicator of
   how many bits of data the system can accept per second.  This could
   be one of the overloading factor for session border controller which
   handles media (especially video) as well.

   In this overload protection mechanism document, SIP server indicates
   its resource capability to the prior SIP server by which prior SIP
   server will be able to perform intelligent routing.  As SIP is used
   for overload protection, it is easy to relate the overload protection
   information to specific SIP entity within the SIP network without
   having any separate naming or addressing scheme.

   Apart from overload scenario, the administrator might be interested
   in monitoring the resource utilization pattern at any given time for
   deciding whether the VoIP network resources need to be expanded or it
   is under utilized.  SIP based resource utilization is preferred
   within SIP network and removes the need for using any other
   management protocol for resource monitoring purpose.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  This
   document only uses these key words when referencing normative
   statements in existing RFCs.


3.  Resource availability indication mechanism

   Resource availability indication mechanism by UA or Proxy helps load
   balancer, resource statistics collector to collect the data and act
   upon them accordingly.  The solution is targeted for SIP trunks or
   between SIP servers.  By the proposed mechanism, the individual
   devices indicate their current resource availability information
   through SIP event framework mechanism.  Load Balancer or resource
   statistics collector acts as a subscriber and subscribe to the
   resource in the individual UA.  Individual devices acts as Notifier
   and inform the resource information in XML.  In case of hop-by-hop
   overload mechanism is required, SUBSCRIBE MAY include max-forward
   header with value as 1.

   In the load balancing scenario, the load balancer subscribes to all
   the relevant SIP trunks and informed about the current resource
   information.  Based on the resource availability indication, the call
   is routed to the individual SIP trunk.  In case one of the devices is
   reached almost out of the resource, the device notifies the load
   balancer immediately.  The load balancer SHOULD NOT forward any new
   SIP dialog towards the notified device till further resource
   availability indication from the device.  The threshold for each of
   the resource is decided based on the set of pre-configured values.
   This helps load balancer to decide where to route the dialog when
   multiple routes are available for the given dialog.  In case the
   entire route for the given dialog in load balancer is overloaded, 500
   internal error or 4xx response (response code is TBD) is sent out to
   incoming UAC.  The algorithm of using resource availability to
   achieve load balancing is kept out of scope of this document.  The
   threshold for the resource has to be decided by administrator by keep
   in mind that NOTIFY message has to be formed and send out to the
   external server and also resource priority dialog has to be processed
   without any interruption.

   In the resource monitor, the periodic resource information is
   collected from all the devices and the reports are formed.  These
   statistics provide effective resource utilization indication for any
   given resource at any point of time.  This information helps
   administrator to take informed decision and corrective measures to
   tackle under or over resource utilization in the network.

   The local policy has to be put in place in SIP Notifying entity to

   provide fair resource allocation algorithm to ensure that Non-
   SUBSCRIBE overloading entity may not have any unfair share of
   resources.


4.  Resource availability Event package definition

   This document defines the details of the SIP event package for
   Resource availability based routing according to [RFC3265]

4.1.  Event Package name

   The name of the event package is resource-availability.  This event
   name has to be mentioned in the Event and allow-event header as
   mentioned in [RFC3265]

4.2.  Event Package Parameters

   There is no specific event package parameter specified for this event
   package.

4.3.  SUBSCRIBE bodies

   A SUBSCRIBE request for resource availability policy MAY contain a
   body to request the specific resources availability notification.
   For example, a subscriber is interested in some specific resources
   only.  The details of the subscription filter specification are not
   yet defined.

   A SUBSCRIBE request sent without a body implies the default
   subscription behavior as specified in the sec 4.7.

4.4.  SUBSCRIBE duration

   Subscription duration depends upon the deployment.  The default
   duration for this package is 300 sec.  It is not recommended to have
   the refresh timer less than 180 sec.  Refresh of subscription ensures
   that the next hop is up before new dialog request is forwarded.
   Refresh subscription should be triggered 32 sec before the expiry
   time of the package.  This keepalive mechanism is useful to decide
   whether Notifier trunk is reachable or not.  The user defined value
   shall be used depending on the deployment scenario.

   In case of SUBSCRIBE refresh failure, it is recommended that new
   SUBSCRIBE is initiated after the expiry of user mentioned timer.

Internet-Draft   SIP Resource availability Event package       June 2010


4.5.  NOTIFY bodies

   The body of a NOTIFY message in this event package contains resource
   information of a device.  The format of the NOTIFY body MUST be in
   one of the formats defined in the Accept header field of the
   SUBSCRIBE request or be the default format as specified in [RFC3265].
   The default data format for the NOTIFY body of this event package is
   "application/rai+xml" (defined in Section 7).

   This means that if no Accept header field is specified to a SUBSCRIBE
   request, the NOTIFY will contain a body in the "application/rai+xml"
   format.  If the Accept header field is present in SUBSCRIBE request,
   it MUST include "application/rai+xml" and MAY include any other
   types.

4.6.  Notifier processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   Notifier has to provide the sensitive device resource information to
   the subscriber in the notification mechanism.  The entire subscriber
   has to be authenticated before providing the package details.  The
   existing authentication SIP mechanism like DIGEST, TLS, and S/MIME
   shall be used.  In the trusted domain, the authentication may not be
   required and the administrator has to decide the trusted domain and
   non-trusted domain.

   The requested SUBSCRIBER is not allowed to receive the requested
   information, 403 response MUST be sent by Notifier.

4.7.  Notifier generation of NOTIFY Requests

   NOTIFY has to be formatted as per [RFC3265], it has to contain
   resource availability information.  NOTIFY has to be sent immediately
   after SUBSCRIBE is received for initial dialog or refresh and
   responded with 200 OK.  Notifier MUST notify SUBSCRIBER whenever any
   of the resource reaching almost out of the resource state or going
   below the configured threshold.  Almost out of the resource value for
   the given resource or system will be decided by the administrator.
   The threshold notification helps SUBSCRIBER to decide whether the
   dialog shall be forwarded or not based on SUBSCRIBER policy.
   Notifier shall notify the resource information in the periodic
   manner.  When any of the resource is reaching almost out of the
   resource, NOTIFY will be send which contain only the resource which
   reached almost out of the resource.

4.8.  Subscriber processing of NOTIFY requests

   Subscriber updates the dialog routing logic based on the incoming
   NOTIFY message.  In case NOTIFY message contains almost out of the



Ravindran & Shalya      Expires December 5, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   SIP Resource availability Event package       June 2010


   resource for the specific resource or the whole system, the dialog
   routing logic in the subscriber has to be updated with appropriate
   information by which any further dialog SHOULD NOT be routed to
   Notifier till getting further notification with resource available
   indication from Notifier.

   In case NOTIFY is received in the periodic manner, the resource based
   routing and statistics for the individual device usage at a given
   time is updated with the received NOTIFY message body information.

4.9.  Handling of forked requests

   Forking of SUBSCRIBE request is not supported for this package.  In
   case of forking happened, forked response has to be handled as
   mentioned in Sec 4.4.9 of [RFC3265].

4.10.  Rate of Notifications

   Rate of Notification SHOULD NOT be less than once every 32 sec as the
   notification itself will be observed as an overhead otherwise.  It is
   recommended that the rate of notification happens once every 120 sec.
   The administrator is the best person to decide the notification time
   based on the network topology.  The rate of notification MAY be
   reduced or stopped when almost out of the resource is attained for
   the critical resources like CPU, Memory and the critical resource
   list is based on device.

4.11.  State Agents

   The resource availability indications are generated by SIP entity
   directly and there is no need of explicit state agent for this
   package.  As load balancing based on the resource availability
   indication has to be done in the real time, the aggregation done by
   any state agent will introduce delay and hence defeat overload
   requirements.

4.12.  Behavior of SIP Proxy

   This subscription mechanism is recommended for neighboring SIP
   entities as it provides more control on overload mechanism.  In case
   the network topology requires to pass this resource information
   through proxy, Proxy has to forward SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY messages and
   this may be required when intermediate proxy is interworking and load
   balancing is decided by entity sitting behind the proxy.

Internet-Draft   SIP Resource availability Event package       June 2010


4.13.  Refresh SUBSCRIBE mechanism for failure handling

   Apart from refresh subscription as explained in sec 4.4, Refresh
   subscription shall be triggered in the following network error
   scenarios as well:

   o  ICMP message received during dialog creation from the Notifying
      entity
   o  TCP connection failure from the Notifying entity
   o  Dialog creation timeout

   Refresh Subscription shall be started whenever 503 is received for
   any dialog creation request from Notifying entity.

   Till this refresh subscription succeeds, new dialog MUST NOT be
   forwarded to the Notifying entity.  In case of refresh SUBSCRIBE
   failure, new SUBSCRIBE has to be started as mentioned in sec 4.4 and
   no further dialog has to be forwarded till new SUBSCRIBE dialog is
   created.


5.  Resource availability Indication (RAI) document format

5.1.  Contents

   Resource availability indication (RAI) document is a XML document
   which will be embedded as message body in NOTIFY message of resource-
   availability package.  The document contains

   o  Entity parameter in Resource-availability to specify the entity
      whose resource information is available as part of this message
   o  System Tuple to indicate whether the whole system is overloaded or
      not
   o  Resource Tuple indicates the individual resources total and
      available capabilities, and also whether the resource is available
      for further new dialog processing (Optional)
   o  Resource Subtype provides the granular information within the
      particular resource.  (Optional)

5.2.  XML data format

   RAI object is a XML document.  It MUST have the XML declaration and
   it SHOULD contain an encoding declaration in the XML declaration,
   e.g., "<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>".  If the charset
   parameter of the MIME content type declaration is present and it is
   different from the encoding declaration, the charset parameter takes
   precedence.

Internet-Draft   SIP Resource availability Event package       June 2010


   Every application conformant to this specification MUST accept the
   UTF-8 character encoding to ensure the minimal interoperability.

5.2.1.  Namespace

   The namespace URI for elements defined by this specification is a
   Uniform Resource Namespace (URN) [RFC2141], using the namespace
   identifier 'ietf' defined by [RFC2648] and extended by [RFC3688].

   The URN is as follows: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:rai

5.2.2.  Resource-Availability

   Resource-Availability element MUST contain an xmlns namespace
   attribute with value as urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:rai.

   Resource-availability MUST have entity attribute which contains SIP/
   SIPS URI to identify the device which provides the resource
   information.  The entity attribute SIP/SIPS URI FQDN or IP address
   represents the device and may not have user part.

5.2.3.  System

   All resource-availability element have one System element.  The
   system element represents the whole system as such.  This element
   indicates how much load accepted by the system as such.  In case the
   system is reached almost out of resource, it is expected that load
   balancing entity SHOULD NOT forward the request until otherwise load
   balancing entity knows the resource which shall be used by the new
   dialog without causing any impact to the current state of the system.

   Resource-availability MUST have entity attribute which contains SIP/
   SIPS URI to identify the device which provides the resource
   information.  The entity attribute SIP/SIPS URI FQDN or IP address
   represents the device and may not have user part.

5.3.  Resource

   This element indicates the individual resource status at the given
   time.  This is an optional element wherein the resources type like
   CPU, Memory, DSP, DS0, available bandwidth, disk storage are
   mentioned in type attribute.  Each resource element shall have almost
   out of resource status, total and available resource usage.  This
   resource information helps in routing or load balancing or resource
   monitoring based on the individual resource availability.  Available
   bandwidth mentioned in this element is the indicator of how many bits
   of data the system can process per second session(audio/video).

Internet-Draft   SIP Resource availability Event package       June 2010


5.4.  Resource-subtype

   This element comes within a particular resource element to provide an
   internal division within a given resource.  For example, Memory shall
   be divided into processor memory, IO memory and provides the
   individual status.  This division helps in load balancing in case
   routing entity aware of the resource capability required for the
   specified call.  This is an optional element.

5.5.  Almost-out-of-resource

   Almost-out-of-resource is a Boolean element to indicate whether
   system or resource is reached the threshold or not.  This threshold
   is decided by Notifier or subscriber shall send it through other
   mechanism.

   Almost-out-of-resource value true indicates that the threshold is
   reached.  To avoid the back-forth movement in the threshold range, it
   is preferred to provide the upper watermark value which decides the
   above threshold limit and lower watermark value is used when the
   above threshold is back to normal.  True value is set for almost out
   of resource when upper watermark is reached and when lower watermark
   is reached, almost out of resource is set with false.

                    Above Threshold
                    <--------->  Upper Watermark
                       |   |
                    <--------->  Lower Watermark
                    Below Threshold


                Watermark mechanism for Threshold handling

5.6.  Total & Available

   Total and Available elements provide absolute value or the value
   specified as per unit element.  These are optional element.

5.7.  Unit

   Unit is a string which indicates unit for the given resource or
   resource subtype.  The default value of unit is absolute value.

5.8.  Timestamp

   Timestamp element contains a string indicating the date and time of
   the status change of this tuple.  The value of this element MUST
   follow the IMPP datetime format [RFC3339].  Timestamps that contain

Internet-Draft   SIP Resource availability Event package       June 2010


   'T' or 'Z' MUST use the capitalized forms.

   As a security measure, the timestamp element SHOULD be included in
   all tuples unless the exact time of the status change cannot be
   determined.

5.9.  Example

   The example provides all the tuples involved in rai xml body.

           <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
           <resource-Availability xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:rai"

                           RAI Example XML body


6.  Use Case for Resource Availability mechanism

6.1.  Subscriber acts as resource monitor only

   This is the simple scenario wherein subscriber simply collects the
   Notifier statistics and store or display.  This is useful when
   Administrator is interested in the usage of the VoIP network
   resource.  Total and available element will be used by subscriber.
   In this scenario, subscriber will not honor the almost out of
   resource information from the notifier.

6.2.  Subscriber acts as overload protection

   In this deployment, subscriber stop/start the load based on the
   almost out of resource parameter of the body.  System&aposs almost
   out of resource is set to true whenever any one of the resource is
   reached almost out of the resource.  In case the subscriber is aware
   that the new dialog does not require the set of resource which
   reached almost out resource, the new dialog shall be forwarded.  For
   example, DS0 is almost out of the resource and the new dialog does
   not require DS0 resource, the new dialog shall be forwarded to
   Notifier.  The resource requirement of Notifier for the specific
   dialog shall be intimated to Subscriber through other protocol
   mechanism or provisioning mechanism which is outside the scope of
   this document.

6.3.  Subscriber pools for resource status

   In this mode, Subscriber is interested in the resource status at a
   given time, and one shot subscription shall be used for this
   mechanism.

6.4.  Subscriber in mixed mode

   Any of the above mentioned mechanism shall be combined together based
   on the deployment requirement.  For example, Subscriber performs
   resource monitoring and threshold mechanism at the same time.

   Based on the availability of the resource, the flow of the new
   dialogs shall be decided.  This requires tight understanding between
   subscriber and notifier about the resource information and
   utilization.  Resource information of Notifier shall be provided to
   Subscriber through provisioning mechanism or other protocol mechanism
   which is outside the scope of this document.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security consideration for event based framework as specified in
   [RFC3265] has to be considered for this draft as well.  As the
   resource information is sensitive information, Subscribe/Notify shall
   use TLS transport in case subscriber and Notifier are in the public
   domain.  In case subscriber is a untrusted entity, subscriber will be
   authenticated by responding with 401.  The administrator provides
   authorization mechanism by which different entity will be provided
   with different level of information.  For example, all SIP entity
   within enterprise could be provided complete resource information and
   only system level information could be provided towards service
   provider network.

   The resource information provided in this mechanism is more critical.
   If the above specified mechanism is not secure enough, there is a
   scope for coming up with addition security measures (TBD).
