Internet-Draft          JSON Log Format (JSON-L)                May 2014

1. Definitions

1.1. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

2. Requirements

   A log file consists of a sequence of entries. In a JSON-L log file, 
   each entry is a JSON object [RFC7159].

2.1. Append Only Updates

   One of the chief drawbacks to using JSON notation as a log file 
   format is that a log file is by definition a sequence of entries and 
   a JSON document MUST contain exactly one object. Further JSON objects
   and arrays both require start '{[' and end ']}' markers.

   Use of the JSON notation as a log file format would thus require a 
   process appending data to a log file to either omit the end markers 
   completely or erase the existing end markers, append the new data the
   file and write new end markers. 

   Both approaches are highly unsatisfactory, the first violates the 
   JSON encoding rules and the second introduces a risk of a race 
   condition if two processes attempt to update the same log file at the
   same time. 

   An encoding that permits log entries to be appended to the end of a 
   log file without modifying the existing contents is both safer and 
   more efficient. Since writing data to an append only log file is a 
   common requirement, most platforms already provide efficient and 
   robust primitives to effect append-only updates. 

2.2. Resynchronization

   Resynchronization is a mechanism that allows a reader to detect the 
   start of a log file entry.

   Resynchronization permits a reader to recover in the case that a log 
   entry is corrupted and/or support random access to log file entries.

   Log files may grow to thousands or millions of entries. When dealling
   with log files of such size it is frequently desirable to skip 
   forward or backwards to quickly locate an entry added at a specific 
   time.

   Since JSON objects MAY be of variable lengths and MAY include nested 
   JSON objects, a log file viewer that supports such a random access 
   feature requires a simple means of locating the start of the next 
   entry.

3. Specification

   A JSON-L log file consists of a sequence of zero or more JSON objects
   as specified in [RFC7159] separated by white space that includes at 
   least one newline character. 

   
           JSON-L-text = *(object x-ws)
           
           x-ws = *ws %x0A *ws
           

3.1. Resynchronization

   Since control characters are not permitted inside JSON string values 
   and JSON objects MUST be separated by commas inside a JSON array, the
   sequence '}' *ws LF *ws '{' can only occur at the end of one log 
   entry and the start of the next:'

   
           Boundary = end-object x-ws begin-object

5. IANA Considerations

   The MIME media type for JSON-Log text is application/json-l.

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: json-l

   Required parameters: n/a

   Optional parameters: n/a

   Encoding considerations: binary

   Security considerations: See [this], Section TBS.

   Interoperability considerations: Described in [this]

   Published specification: [this]

   Applications that use this media type: None (so far)

   Additional information:

   
           Magic number(s): n/a
           File extension(s): .jsonl
           Macintosh file type code(s): TEXT
           

   Person & email address to contact for further information: Phillip 
   Hallam-Baker <phill@hallambaker.com> 

   Intended usage: COMMON 

   Restrictions on usage: none

   Author: Phillip Hallam-Baker

   Note: No "charset" parameter is defined for this registration. Adding
   one really has no effect on compliant recipients. 

6. Acnowledgements

   This is a minor modification of the JSON encoding developed by 
   Douglas Crockford. Nico Williams provided useful advice on the 
   resynchronization scheme.
