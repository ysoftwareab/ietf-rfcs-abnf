Abstract

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer model currently
   has no mechanism for dynamic configuration of the Differentiated 
   Services Codepoints (DSCP) for the media streams endpoints 
   establish.  This document creates such a mechanism within SDP, as 
   granular as at the media stream level where more than one stream can
   be in an offer/answer exchange, to set a particular DSCP for the 
   desired Per Hop Behavior (PHB) of a media stream. This same 
   mechanism can change a DSCP of an existing stream based on dynamic 
   network conditions.

1.  Introduction

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] currently is 
   neutral with respect to offering or modifying any domain per hop 
   behavior (PHB) indications during session establishment or session 
   update.  Leaving this task for another mechanism to set, even if it 
   is administratively fixed per application, such as 'voice always has
   the same indication', or 'video always has this other indication'.  
   This fixed basis is undergoing a change, combining the IETF 
   guidelines in [RFC4594] and [RFC5127] with the motivations 
   surrounding [ID-VOICE-ADMIT], SDP becomes the logical place to solve
   per session indications like this.

   Differentiated Services [RFC2474] established a set of per hop 
   behavior indications at layer 3, creating Differentiated Services 
   Codepoints (DSCP) to be viewed by intermediate routers to provide 
   packet treatment based upon these indicators.  

   Additionally, there is no current capability in control plane 
   signaling (aside from SDP's current inability) for an endpoint to 
   offer, suggest, indicate or otherwise set a DSCP of a media stream;
    much less modify a default fixed codepoint.  Example control plane 
   signaling protocols here include SIP [RFC3261], MGCP [RFC3435] and 


Polk                        Expires Aug 2008                   [Page 2]
Internet-Draft      DSCP Stream Configuration in SDP           Feb 2008

   MEGACO [RFC3015] - which all utilize SDP for session capabilities.  
   Further, none of these 3 signaling protocols have awareness that SDP
   has one or more session descriptions within a single offer.  
   Therefore, it appears as if these signaling protocols are not suited
   for satisfying the requirement of per stream DSCP control.

   SDP has such an awareness because it can include more than one 
   stream description within a single offer  [RFC3264], possibly with 
   each stream needing to use a different DSCP, for example, a voice 
   and a video stream.  Thus, it seems appropriate to provide the means
   of indicating which DSCP a stream is to have by the protocol that 
   has the visibility and knowledge of each stream. SDP's knowledge of 
   the desired characteristics of the packet flow provides for this.  
   This document specifies a solution to this lack of ability - in SDP.

   There are times and environments in which the DSCP for a particular 
   voice session, for example, will need to be different than other 
   voice sessions, even from same endpoint.  See [ID-VOICE-ADMIT], 
   which describes and creates a new Expedited Forwarding DSCP (45 or 
   101101) for network admitted mission critical communicates.  There 
   are times in which, from the same endpoint, the DSCP of the same 
   application (i.e., voice) will need to be different based on the 
   conditions of the network, or the type of communication attempted. 
    An example of usage is to provide this session with unique and/or 
   elevated treatment, with an indication how these packets are placed 
   into which MPLS tunnel.  This elevated treatment can be achieved on 
   a per stream basis, or for each stream with this indication if a 
   router is configured to schedule/police this traffic differently 
   than other real-time traffic (such as RTP).

   This extension will not be useful in all environments. Care needs to
   be taken by any domain implementing this capability to prevent 
   misuse creating a means for unauthorized communications to achieve 
   an elevated PHB.  That said, a viable use is for a service provider 
   who wants to grant its customers greater service than roaming 
   endpoints into that network.  

   This extension is for endpoint to endpoint session set-up and 
   dynamic changes of DSCPs.


1.1 Changes Since Last Version  

   The following are the changes since the last version of this 
   document was produced:

   - removed all discussion of servers and intermediaries, including 
     how they can initiate a change in DSCP values for any streams.

   - changed the ability of the answerer to change the 'dscp' attribute
     in the answer, and what this means

   - fixed nits


2.  SDP Attributes Definition

   This document creates the 'dscp' media-level SDP [RFC4566] 
   attribute. The following is the ABNF syntax [RFC5234], which is 
   based on the SDP [RFC4566] grammar:


   attribute        = dscp

   dscp             = "dscp" *(SP dscp-value)
   dscp-value       = dscp-value-rtp "/" dscp-value-rtcp 
                                      SP direction-tag
   dscp-value-rtp   = numeric-sting / alpha-string
   dscp-value-rtcp  = numeric-sting / alpha-string
   numeric-sting    = 0-63 (limited range)
   alpha-string     = token
   direction-tag    = sendonly / recvonly / sendrecv

   The dscp-value is the combination of the three parts

      o  a dscp-value-rtp for the RTP of a session
      o  a dscp-value-rtcp for the RTCP of a session
      o  and a direction-tag for the DSCP of RTP

   The dscp-value-rtp and dscp-value-rtcp MUST each be in one of three 
   forms, though they both do not have to be the same form in the same 
   attribute

      o  a decimal in the range of 0 to 63 
      o  an alpha string with the DSCP category (i.e., EF)
      o  or it can be a 6-bit binary sequence (i.e., 101110 for EF)

   The decimal range of the dscp-value-rtp and dscp-value-rtcp is 
   limited to 0-63 because that is matching all the possible values as 
   defined in [RFC2474] for codepoints.  The alpha string is the name 
   of the class of DSCP, compiled here.

      o  EF or Expedited Forwarding, as defined in [RFC3246]
      o  AF or Assure forwarding, as defined in [RFC2597]
      o  BE or Best Effort, as defined in [RFC2474]
      o  VOICE-ADMIT, as defined in [ID-VOICE-ADMIT] 

   Inclusion of the dscp-value-rtcp is OPTIONAL. Lack of the presence 
   of a dscp-value-rtcp in a 'dscp' attribute means the RTCP is to use 
   whatever is default configured in the endpoint.  

   If the 'dscp' attribute is present, the dscp-value-rtp MUST be 


Polk                        Expires Aug 2008                   [Page 4]
Internet-Draft      DSCP Stream Configuration in SDP           Feb 2008

   present, and the direction-tag SHOULD be present, to ensure both 
   endpoints fully understand the DSCPs to use for a media level 
   session.

   The direction-tag part of the dscp-value is to indicate which 
   direction this codepoint is to be used in fro the dscp-value-rtp 
   only, from the perspective of the endpoint generating this 
   attribute.  An endpoint MUST be able to indicate the bi-directional 
   DSCP for a session.  The receiver of the SDP does not have to comply
   with this DSCP, but SHOULD indicate which value it intends to use.  
   This is not a negotiation.  The offer can contain the sendrecv 
   direction indicator to state what DSCP it will use and what DSCP 
   SHOULD be indicated in the answer.  If the answer does not contain a
   sendrecv indication, but does have a (answer SDP) of another DSCP 
   value for RTP, then the original offer was accepted in the offer to 
   answer direction, but the answer to offer direction will use another
   DSCP for RTP.  If the answer did not contain a 'dscp' attribute, the
   offering endpoint SHOULD consider that to indicate the answerer 
   either did no understand the 'dscp' attribute in the offer, or the 
   it will maintain using whatever DSCP is preconfigured into that 
   endpoint for this session.

   There can be only one dscp-value per media description.  

   The following is an example of an "m=" line with a 'dscp' attribute:

     m=audio 50001 RTP/AVP 0
     a=dscp 46/16 sendrecv

   The above "a=" line would set RTP packets for this stream to DSCP 
   46, or Expedited Forwarding (EF) as defined by [RFC3246], in both 
   directions (provided the answerer agreed with the direction-tag of 
   this attribute.

   An empty "a=dscp" attribute, with no value (numeric or alpha) MAY be
   present in an offer or answer to indicate support for this extension
   in SDP. 


3.  Offer/Answer Behavior

   An offer/answer exchange using the 'dscp' attribute allows endpoints 
   provide media packets the desired DSCP through a routed 
   infrastructure.  Including the 'dscp' in an offer or answer 
   attribute is not a negotiation.  This is a indication of a value to 
   be used as a binary DSCP in the media packets.  The offerer can 
   include a suggestion to use the same DSCP bi-directionally.  The 
   answerer's answer will indicate is this is acceptable or not.  
   Figure 1. shows this exchange,

      Figure 1. Diagram setting initial DSCP Values

   The following is an example of the "m=" line in Figure 1. with a 
   'dscp' attribute:

     m=audio 50001 RTP/AVP 0
     a=dscp 46/16 sendrecv  

   The above "a=" line would set the media packets for this stream to 
   Expedited Forwarding (EF) as defined by [RFC3246].  The RTCP packets
   would be set to CS2 (16), or the OAM class according to [RFC4594].  
   The direction-tag is set to send-recv in the offer, and accepted in 
   the answer (because it is also indicating the same DSCP values and 
   in both directions).

   If, at some point during the session, an endpoint wanted to change 
   the DSCP markings of the RTP packets within this media stream, it 
   could sent this offer (illustrated in Figure 2.) in both directions:

     m=audio 50001 RTP/AVP 0
     a=dscp 0/16 sendrecv  

   thereby setting this media stream to what is considered Best Effort 
   PHB, in both directions, while not changing the DSCP of the RTCP.


3.1 Offerer Behavior

   An offerer MUST include a 'dscp' attribute in a offer, if it wants 
   to indicate it wants to have a particular stream have a non-default 
   DSCP value in one or both directions.  The offerer MUST set a 
   direction-tag if it wants a non-default DSCP in one direction or 
   another.  The offerer does not have to include a direction-tag if it
   knows the answerer will not change the dscp-value in the answer.  An
   offerer SHOULD NOT assume this is always the case, and be sure and 
   include exactly what it wants.

   An offerer receiving an answer other than a copy of what was offered


Polk                        Expires Aug 2008                   [Page 6]
Internet-Draft      DSCP Stream Configuration in SDP           Feb 2008

   only considers the changes to apply to what the answerer is going to
   do. It MUST NOT change what the offerer is going to do.  There is no
   rejection of a stream based on what a DSCP is in a packet, so there 
   is no ill effects from this.  However, the answerer can become an 
   offerer in an UPDATE or reINVITE (using SIP) of the same session if 
   they do not want either endpoint using the DSCPs offered originally.
   Care SHOULD be taken that this does not occur over and over gain 
   during the same session, as this event occurring more than once does
   not solve anything, and wastes resources.  

   An answer that does not contain a 'dscp' attribute when there was 
   one in the offer means the answerer does not support this extension.

   An offerer MAY include an empty 'dscp' attribute to indicate support
   for this capability.

   An offerer MAY include a 'dscp' attribute in a offer for the 
   purposes of indicating which level of support or service the offerer
   wants this session to have.  Consider the case in which a customer 
   (the offerer) has a contract with a network that allows multiple 
   service levels, fr example a gold/silver/bronze package.  An offerer
   MAY include this 'dscp' attribute to indicate which service level 
   this session is desired to achieve.  This allows Alice to offer to 
   Bob one of three different service levels of RTP to Bob, with the 
   5-tuple being the same for each of the sessions.


3.2 Answerer Behavior

   An answerer supporting this extension MUST adhere to the 'dscp' 
   attribute in the offer if the offer in whole is acceptable to the 
   answerer.  It is RECOMMENDED that the answerer reciprocate the 
   'dscp' attribute in the answer; meaning if the offer is 

        a=dscp 46/16 sendrecv  

   the answer SHOULD be 

        a=dscp 46/16 sendrecv  

   If the offer is 

        a=dscp 46/16 sendonly

   and the answerer is not configured to use that DSCP, it would be 
   either what DSCP the answerer is configured to use for its RTP 
   packets with a sendonly direction-tag, or if it does not want to 
   inform the offerer, it can answer like this

        a=dscp 46/16 recvonly  

   Each of these cases are acceptable according to the rules here.


Polk                        Expires Aug 2008                   [Page 7]
Internet-Draft      DSCP Stream Configuration in SDP           Feb 2008


   What is not acceptable for an answerer is to tell the offerer which 
   DSCP the offerer should use in the initial answer.  This is left for
   an (using SIP as an example) UPDATE or reINVITE transaction where 
   the answerer becomes the offerer and attempts to suggest/control the
   DSCPs to be used for this particular media stream.

   An endpoint that does not support this extension merely ignores the 
   'dscp' attribute and answers without it.  An answer that does not 
   contain a 'dscp' attribute when there was one in the offer means the
   answerer does not support this extension.  A DSCP of 0 (zero) is a 
   valid DSCP, and MUST NOT be considered a null answer, and MUST only 
   be used if the endpoint wishes to set their RTP codepoints to the 
   "Best Effort" traffic class.

   An answerer that wants to go with what the offerer has offerer 
   merely copies the 'dscp' attribute from the offer.  If this is the 
   offer

        a=dscp 46/16 sendrecv  

   this is the answer

        a=dscp 46/16 sendrecv  

   Inclusion of the dscp-value-rtcp is OPTIONAL in this extension.  If 
   an offerer or answerer wants to set or modify the DSCP to be used by
   either endpoint, this extension MUST be used to ensure consistency.

   With that said, discussion about copying the 'dscp' attribute from 
   offer to answer equates supporting and accepting an offer, this does
   not apply to the RTCP value, which can change, and still consider 
   the media stream 'dscp' attribute to have been accepted via a copy.  

   [EDITOR's NOTE: does this make sense (that this extension is only 
    sensitive to RTP codepoint values and not both?)


4.  Changing the 'dscp' Attribute in an Established Session

   Whether or not the 'dscp' attribute was used in the initial 
   offer/answer exchange, either endpoint is allowed to generate offers 
   can change the 'dscp' attribute from a

      o  null (or no DSCP value in the media packets) value,
      o  a default uncommunicated value 
      o  or a previously communicated 'dscp' attribute

   to something (else) during a session.  Maintaining compliance with 
   Section 3 above, here in Figure 2. is one example of a 'dscp' 
   attribute being changed for a media stream.

    Figure 2. Diagram with Intermediary setting initial DSCPs

   In Figure 2. there is an existing session between Alice and Bob, 
   when Alice's endpoint decides (however that occurs) to modify the 
   DSCPs of a this stream.  This process starts with an offer.  Figure 
   2. shows an existing media stream marked as EF or 46, but Alice 
   wants to change this to a codepoint of 0 (zero) for whatever 
   reason.  Perhaps the call was preempted and needs to be moved into 
   a Best Effort class to maintain the call.

   The current DSCP being used is (perhaps as if the session was 
   brought up as)

        a=dscp 46/16 sendrecv  

   Alice's new offer is

        a=dscp 0/16 sendrecv  

   If Bob answers affirmatively, this is the answer

        a=dscp 0/16 sendrecv  

   This changes the marking of the media stream packets between the two
   endpoints.  This MAY be how an IMS P- or S-CSCF modifies the DSCP of
   a particular session.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers one new media level SDP attribute in 
   the att-field (media level only) table.

5.1.  Registration of the SDP 'dscp' Attribute

   This section instructs the IANA to register the following SDP att-
   field under the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters
   registry:

   Contact name:  James Polk <jmpolk@cisco.com>, +1.817.271.3552

   Attribute name:  dscp

   Long-form attribute name:  Mechanism for Configuring the DSCP of a
                              Media Stream and related RTCP indication
                              for that stream

   Type of attribute:  Media level only

   Subject to charset:  No

   Purpose of attribute:  To configure a new DSCP for one or more (i.e.
                          possibly each) media stream within an SDP 
                          during session establishment or session 
                          modification, as well as each related RTCP 
                          DSCP value 

   Allowed attribute values:  - For DSCP of RTP, see Section 2. of this
                                document for details
                              - For DSCP of RTCP, see Section 2. of 
                                this document for details

6.  Security Considerations

   An attacker may attempt to add, modify, or remove the 'dscp' 
   attribute(s) from a session description.  This could result in a 
   media stream receiving undesirable behavior through a network.  For 
   example, the endpoints under attack may receive a more or less 
   desirable PHB.  

   Consequently, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that integrity protection 
   be applied to SDP session descriptions carrying these attributes.  
   For session descriptions carried in SIP [RFC3261], S/MIME [RFC3851] 
   is the natural choice to provide such end-to-end integrity 
   protection, as described in [RFC3261].  Other applications MAY use a
   different form of integrity protection.


7.  Open Issues

   Here is a list of known open issues understood to the author as 
   needing to be addressed:

   #1 - This document focuses on the RTP and RTCP DSCP markings, yet 
        favors the RTP markings in the offer/answer exchange.  Should 
        equal weight be given to adhering to uniformity during an 
        offer/answer exchange for RTCP markings?

   #2 - Not sure the ABNF is right for the look of the examples, which 
        I believe is what is desired to convey what this extension 
        intends.
