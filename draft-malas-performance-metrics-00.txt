     1. Introduction 

        SIP has become a standard among many service providers, vendors, and 
        end users.  Although there are many different standards for measuring 
        the reliability and performance of signaling protocols, none of these 
        have been adapted for use with SIP.  This document is intended for 
        providing a guideline for the above listed entities in providing a 
        standard approach for measuring and reporting SIP reliability and 
        performance metrics.  This will allow a common approach and 
        understanding of expectations between service providers, vendors, and 
        the users of those services. 

        Not all metrics for reliability and performance map to all 
        applications of the SIP.  This document provides an overview of many 
        different metrics, which may be used as an individual or set of 
        metrics necessary based on the use of SIP. 

        There are many metrics available for determining both reliability and 
        performance.  Although this document contains a number of them, it is 
        not intended to be exhaustive.  Instead, it is designed to provide a 
        common sub-set with a common agreed upon definition.

     2. Metrics 

     2.1. Answer Seizure Ratio (ASR) 

        ASR [4] is defined as the number of INVITE requests resulting in a 
        200 OK response, to the total number of attempted INVITE requests. 
         
              # of INVITE Requests w/ associated 200OK 
        ASR = ---------------------------------------- 
                     Total # of INVITE Requests 
         
         
          UA1                     UA2 
           |                       | 
           |INVITE                 | 
           |---------------------> | 
           |           /\       100| 
           | <---------||----------| 
           |           ||          | 
           |         Seizure       | 
           |           ||       180| 
           | <---------||----------| 
           |           \/       200| 
           | <---------------------| 
           |                       | 
           |                       | 
         
     2.2. Post Invite Delay (PID) 

        In a successful request attempt, PID [4] is defined as the time 
        interval from the moment the INVITE message containing the necessary 
        information is passed by the originating agent or user to the 
        intended mediation or destination agent until a response is received 
        indicating an audible or visual status of the INVITE request.  When 
        SIP is utilized for traditional telephony-like dialing, this metric 
        is synonymous with the Post Dial Delay (PDD).  In SIP, the message 
        indicating status would be a 180 and 183 message received in response 
        to an INVITE request.  In some cases, a 180 or 183 message is not 
        received, but rather a 200 message is received as the first status 
        message instead.  In these situations, the 200 message would be used 
        to calculate the interval. 

        In a failed request attempt, the interval is defined from the INVITE 
        request and a failure indication status response.  A failure response 
        is described as a 4XX, 5XX, or possible 6XX message.

     Internet-Draft    SIP Reliability and Performance Metrics      May 2006 
         

        PID  = Time of Status Indicative Response – Time of INVITE 

               SUM (Time of Status Indicative Response – Time of INVITE) 
        APID = ---------------------------------------------------------

           |INVITE                 | 
           |---------------------> | 
           |           /\       100|

           | <---------------------| 
           |                       | 
         
     2.3. Call Hold Time (CHT) 

        CHT [4] is usually calculated as an average and is defined as the 
        duration of a call from receipt of a 200 OK and an associated BYE 
        message indicating call completion. 

        CHT  = Time of BYE – Time of 200 OK 

                  SUM (Time of BYE – Time of 200 OK) 
        ACHT = ----------------------------------------- 
                    SUM # of INVITE w/ 200OK & BYE 
         
          UA1                     UA2 
           |                       | 
           |INVITE                 | 
           |---------------------> | 
           |                    100| 
           | <---------------------| 
           |                    180| 
           | <---------------------| 
           |                    200| 
           | <---------------------|

           |           CHT         | 
           |           ||          | 
           |BYE        \/          |

     2.4. Ineffective Attempts (IA) 

        IA [3] utilizing SIP is defined as a proxy or agent, which internally 
        releases a call with a failed or congested condition.  The following 
        failure responses may provide a guideline for this criterion: 

        1. 408 Request Timeout 

        2. 500 Server Internal Error 

        3. 503 Service Unavailable 

        4. 504 Server Timeout 

                  # of IA Attempts 
        IA % = ----------------------- 
                # of INVITE Requests 

          UA1                     UA2 
           |                       | 
           |INVITE                 | 
           |---------------------> | 
           |                    503| 
           | <---------------------| 
           |ACK                    | 
           |---------------------> | 
           |                       | 

     2.5. Cutoff Calls (CC) 

        CC [3] utilizing SIP is defined as an active session, which is 
        terminated due to a condition other than a normal disconnected such 
        as a BYE or CANCEL. 

                              # of CC’s 
        CC % = ----------------------------------------- 
                # of INVITE Requests w/ associated BYE 

     2.6. Call Success Rate (CSR) 

        CSR is intended to provide a metric, which summarizes the overall 
        service provided.  A recommended method for calculating CSR is 
        through utilizing a combination of IA and CC. 

        CSR = 100% - (IA% - CC%)

     2.7. Defects Per Million (DPM) 

        DPM was originally developed by Motorola, and is now more commonly 
        referred to as Six Sigma quality management. It defines a method for 
        calculating the number of defects per million “items” produced.  Many 
        service providers are using this metric.  In SIP, this would be 
        calculated as the number of “defective” failure responses per million 
        final release responses received in response to an INVITE request.  
        The following failure responses may provide a guideline for this 
        defective criterion: 

        1. 500 Server Internal Error 

        2. 503 Service Unavailable 

        3. 504 Server Timeout 

     3. Security Considerations 

        Security should be considered in the aspect of securing the relative 
        data utilized in providing input to the above calculations.  All 
        other aspects of security should be considered as described in [2].   

     4. IANA Considerations 

        There are no IANA considerations at this time. 

     5. Conclusions 

        The proposed guideline provides a description of common reliability 
        and performance metrics, and their defined use with SIP.  The use of 
        these metrics will provide a common viewpoint across all vendors, 
        service providers, and customers.
