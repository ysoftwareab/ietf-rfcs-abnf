1.  Introduction

   This memo defines textual conventions for use in monitoring, status,
   and configuration MIBs for IPsec.  It includes a MIB module that
   defines those textual conventions.

2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [2571].

   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [1212] and RFC 1215
        [1215]. The second version, called SMIv2, is described in
        STD 58, RFC 2578 [2578], RFC 2579 [2579] and RFC 2580 [2580].

   o    Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [1157]. A second version of the
        SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [1901] and
        RFC 1906 [1906]. The third version of the message protocol is
        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [1906], RFC 2572 [2572]
        and RFC 2574 [2574].

   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [1157]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [1905].

   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [2573]
        and the view-based access control mechanism described in
        RFC 2575 [2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3.  Discussion

   The IPsec architecture [SECARCH] defines protocols for dynamic key
   management.  These are based on the Internet Security Association and
   Key Management Protocol [ISAKMP].

   ISAKMP defines the concept of Domains of Interpretation (DOI).  The
   IPsec architecture has defined the Internet IP Security Domain of
   Interptetation for ISAKMP [IPDOI].

   The IPsec architecture defines the Internet Key Exchange [IKE].  The
   use of this protocol is indicated by one of the constants in the
   IPsec DOI.

   This MIB defines textual conventions for the constants defined in
   ISAKMP, the IPsec DOI, and IKE.

   These are defined in a seperate MIB for two reasons.

   o    There will be variables with a syntax corresponding to these
        textual conventions in numberous MIBs that will be defined for
        the IPsec architecture.

   o    All of the numbers defined in these textual conventions are in
        "magic number" spaces that are managed by the IANA.

   If these conventions were part of the relevant MIBs, those MIBs would
   be constantly out of date.  By placing them in a seperate MIB, that
   MIB can be maintained by the IANA simultaneously with assigning new
   values.

5.  Security Considerations

   Since this MIB defines only textual conventions, there are no
   security considerations.  Security considerations exist only when
   managed objects are defined with these textual conventions.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document is the MIB definitions corresponding to a group of
   "magic numberes" that are maintained by the IANA.  The IANA will
   maintain the MIB in this document as they assign new values of these
   magic numbers.

   This MIB will be maintained in the same manner as the IANAifType-MIB.

7.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks are extended to Tim Jenkins for modifying his MIBs to use
   these textual conventions.

8.  Revision History

   This section will be removed before publication.

   February 3, 1999.  Initial release as draft-shriver-doi-tc-mib-
   00.txt, due to issues as to whether the MIB was an IPsec or IPsecond
   work item.

Internet Draft     IPsec DOI Textual Conventions MIB       November 2000


   March 22, 1999.  Released as draft-ietf-ipsec-doi-tc-mib-00.txt.
   Added IsakmpDOI textual convention.

   October 13, 1999.  Use real number in experimental branch.  Added
   IsakmpExchangeType and IkeExchangeType.  Split IkeNotifyMessageType
   off of IsakmpNotifyMessageType, and removed IPsec DOI values from the
   latter.  Corrected latest values of IkeAuthMethod, there had been
   some "number grabbing" in Internet-Drafts, now tracking the IKE
   Internet-Draft.  Cleaned up references.

   October 15, 1999.  Removed stray comma in MIB.

   June 13, 2000.  Enforced consistent capitalization of IPsec.

   November 22, 2000.  Updated with the recent IANA assignments,
   particularly for AES, also from RFC 2857.  Removed any numbers
   assigned only in the IKE Internet-Draft, since those cannot go in an
   RFC, and this is going out first.
