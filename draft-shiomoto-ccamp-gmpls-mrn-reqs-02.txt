  Abstract  
      
     Most of the initial efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have 
     been related to environments hosting devices with a single 
     switching capability, that is, one data plane switching layer. 
     The complexity raised by the control of such data planes is 
     similar to that seen in classical IP/MPLS networks.  
      
     By extending MPLS to support multiple switching technologies, 
     GMPLS provides a comprehensive framework for the control of a 
     multi-layered network of either a single switching technology or 
     multiple switching technologies. In GMPLS, a switching 
     technology domain defines a region, and a network of multiple 
     switching types is referenced in this document as a multi-region 
     network (MRN). When referring in general to a layered network,

     document uses the term, Multi-layer Network (MLN). This draft 
     defines a framework for GMPLS based multi-region/multi-layer 
     networks and lists a set of functional requirements.

  1. Introduction  
      
     Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) extends MPLS to handle multiple 
     switching technologies: packet switching, layer-two switching, 
     TDM switching, wavelength switching, and fiber switching (see 
     [GMPLS-ARCH]). The Interface Switching Capability (ISC) concept 
     is introduced for these switching technologies and is designated 
     as follows: PSC (packet switch capable), L2SC (Layer-2 switch 
     capable), TDM (Time Division Multiplex capable), LSC (lambda 
     switch capable), and FSC (fiber switch capable).  
      
     Service providers may operate networks where multiple different 
     switching technologies exist. The representation, in a GMPLS

     control plane, of a switching technology domain is referred to 
     as a region [HIER].  
      
     A switching type describes the ability of a node to forward data 
     of a particular data plane technology, and uniquely identifies a 
     network region. A layer describes a data plane switching 
     granularity level (e.g. VC4, VC-12). A data plane layer is 
     associated with a region in the control plane (e.g. VC4 LSP 
     associated to TDM, Packet LSP associated to PSC). More than one 
     data plane layer can be associated to the same region (e.g. both 
     VC4 and VC12 are associated to TDM). Thus, a control plane 
     region identified by its switching type value (e.g. TDM) can 
     itself be sub-divided into smaller granularity based on the 
     bandwidth that defines the "data plane switching layers" e.g. 
     from VC-11 to VC-4-256c. The Interface Switching Capability 
     Descriptor (ISCD) [GMPLS-RTG] identifying the interface switching 
     type, the encoding type and the switching bandwidth granularity, 
     supports this additional granularity. The ISCD uniquely 
     identifies a set of one or more network layers e.g. TDM ISC 
     covers from VC-11 to VC-4-256c. 
      
     A network comprising transport nodes with multiple data plane 
     layers of either the same ISC or different ISCs, controlled by a 
     single GMPLS control plane instance, is called a Multi-Layer 
     Network (MLN). To differentiate a network supporting LSPs of 
     different switching technologies (ISCs) from a single region 
     network, a network supporting more than one switching technology 
     is called a Multi-Region Network (MRN).  
      
     MRNs can be categorized according to the distribution of the 
     switching type values amongst the LSRs:  
     - Network elements are single switching capable LSRs and   
       different types of LSRs form the network. All TE links   
       terminating on such nodes have the same switching type value.   
       A typical example is a network composed of PSC and   
       TDM LSRs with only PSC TE-link ends and with only TDM TE-link 
       ends, respectively.  
     - Network elements are multi-switching capable LSRs i.e. nodes   
       hosting at least more than one switching capability. TE links   
       terminating on such nodes may have a set of one or more   
       switching type value. A typical example is a   
       network composed of LSRs that are capable of switching with   
       PSC+TDM TE-links. Multi-switching capable LSRs are further   
       classified as "simplex" and "hybrid" nodes (see Section 4.2).  
     - Any combination of the above two elements. A network composed   
       of both single and multi-switching capable LSRs. 
      
     Since GMPLS provides a comprehensive framework for the control 
     of different switching capabilities, a single GMPLS instance may 
     be used to control the MRNs/MLNs enabling rapid service 
     provisioning and efficient traffic engineering across all 
     switching capabilities. In such networks, TE Links are 
     consolidated into a single Traffic Engineering Database (TED). 
     Since this TED contains the information relative to all the

     different regions/layers existing in the network, a path across 
     multiple regions/layers can be computed using this TED. Thus 
     optimization of network resources can be achieved across 
     multiple regions/layers. 
      
     Consider, for example, a MRN consisting of IP/MPLS routers and 
     TDM cross-connects. Assume that a packet LSP is routed between 
     source and destination IP/MPLS routers, and that the LSP can be 
     routed across the PSC-region (i.e., utilizing only resources of 
     the IP/MPLS level topology). If the performance objective for 
     the LSP is not satisfied, new TE links may be created between 
     the IP/MPLS routers across the TDM-region (for example, VC-12 
     links) and the LSP can be routed over those links. Further, even 
     if the LSP can be successfully established across the PSC-region, 
     TDM hierarchical LSPs across the TDM region between the IP/MPLS 
     routers may be established and used if doing so enables meeting 
     an operators objectives on network resources available (e.g., 
     link bandwidth, and adaptation port between regions) across the 
     multiple regions. The same considerations hold when VC4 LSPs are 
     provisioned to provide extra flexibility for the VC12 and/or 
     VC11 layers in a MLN. 
      
     This document describes the requirements to support multi-
     region/multi-layer networks. There is no intention to specify 
     solution specific elements in this document. The applicability 
     of existing GMPLS protocols and any protocol extensions to the 
     MRN/MLN will be addressed in separate documents.

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and 
     "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
     in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].  
      
  3. Positioning  
      
     A multi-region network (MRN) is always a multi-layer network 
     (MLN) since the network devices on region boundaries bring 
     together different ISCs. A MLN, however, is not necessarily a 
     MRN since multiple layers could be fully contained within a 
     single region. For example, VC12, VC4, VC4-4c are different 
     layers of the TDM region. 
      
  3.1.   Data plane layers 
      
     A data plane layer is a collection of network resources capable 
     of terminating and/or switching data traffic of a particular 
     format. These resources can be used for establishing LSPs or 
     connectionless traffic delivery. For example, VC-11 and VC-4-64c 
     represent two different layers.  
      
     A network resource is atomic within the layer in which it is 
     defined except PSC layers. For example, it is possible to

     allocate an integer number of VC12 resources to create a VC12 
     layer LSP, but fractions of VC12 resources cannot be allocated 
     within the VC12 layer. 
      
  3.2.   LSP Regions   
      
     From the control plane viewpoint, an LSP region is defined as a 
     set of one or several data plane layers that share the same type 
     of switching technology, that is, the same switching type. 
     Examples of regions are: PSC, L2SC, TDM, LSC, and FSC regions. 
     Hence, an LSP region is a technology domain (identified by the 
     ISC type) for which data plane resources (i.e. data links) are 
     represented into the control plane as an aggregate of TE 
     information associated with a set of links (i.e. TE links). For 
     example VC-11 and VC-4-64c capable TE links are part of the same 
     TDM Region.  
      
     Note also that the region is a control plane only concept. That 
     is, layers of the same region share the same switching 
     technology and, therefore, need the same set of technology 
     specific signaling objects.  
     Multiple layers can exist in a single region network. Moreover, 
     the control plane mechanisms introduced and defined for LSP 
     regions, for example the Forwarding Adjacency (FA), and the 
     Virtual FA Topology described as part of this document can 
     equally be described from the perspective of a multi-layer data 
     plane. 
       
  3.3.   Services 
      
     A service provider's network may be divided into different 
     service layers. The customer's network is considered from the 
     provider's perspective as the highest service layer. It 
     interfaces to the highest service layer of the service 
     provider's network. Connectivity across the highest service 
     layer of the service provider's network may be provided with 
     support from successively lower service layers. Service layers 
     are realized via a hierarchy of network layers located generally 
     in several regions and commonly arranged according to the 
     switching capabilities of network devices. 
      
     Some customers purchase Layer 1 (i.e. transport) services from 
     the service provider, some Layer 2 (e.g. ATM), while others 
     purchase Layer 3 (IP/MPLS) services. The service provider 
     realizes the services by a stack of network layers located 
     within one or more network regions. The network layers are 
     commonly arranged according to the switching capabilities of the 
     devices in the networks. Thus, a customer network may be 
     provided on top of the GMPLS-based multi-region/multi-layer 
     network. For example, a Layer One service (realized via the 
     network layers of TDM, and/or LSC, and/or FSC regions) may 
     support a Layer Two network (realized via ATM VP/VC) which may 
    itself support a Layer Three network (IP/MPLS region). The 
     supported data plane relationship is a data-plane client-server

     relationship where the lower layer provides a service for the 
     higher layer using the data links realized in the lower layer. 
      
     Services provided by a GMPLS-based multi-region/multi-layer 
     network are referred to as "Multi-region/Multi-layer network 
     services". For example legacy IP and IP/MPLS networks can be 
     supported on top of multi-region/multi-layer networks. Details 
     concerning the requirements for such services and the required 
     functionality to deliver such services will be addressed in a 
     future release of this document. It has, however, to be 
     emphasized that delivery of such services is a strong motivator 
     for the deployment of multi-region/multi-layer networks. 
      
  3.4.   Vertical and Horizontal interaction and integration 
      
     Vertical interaction is defined as the collaborative mechanisms 
     within a network element that is capable of supporting more than 
     one switching capability and of realizing the client/server 
     relationships between them. Integration of these interactions as 
     part of the control plane is referred to as vertical integration. 
     The latter refers thus to the collaborative mechanisms within a 
     single control plane instance driving multiple switching 
     capabilities. Such a concept is useful in order to construct a 
     framework that facilitates efficient network resource usage and 
     rapid service provisioning in carrier's networks that are based 
     on multiple switching technologies.  
      
     Horizontal interaction is defined as the protocol exchange 
     between network controllers that manage transport nodes within a 
     given region (i.e. nodes with the same switching capability). 
     For instance, the control plane interaction between two LSC 
     network elements is an example of horizontal interaction. GMPLS 
     protocol operations handle horizontal interactions within the 
     same routing area. The case where the interaction takes place 
     across a domain boundary, such as between two routing areas 
     within the same network layer, is currently being evaluated as 
     part of the inter-domain work [Inter-domain], and is referred to 
     as horizontal integration. Thus horizontal integration refers to 
     the collaborative mechanisms between network partitions and/or 
     administrative divisions such as routing areas or autonomous 
     systems. This distinction gets blurred when administrative 
     domains match layer boundaries. For example, the collaborative 
     mechanisms in place between two lambda switching capable areas 
     relate to horizontal integration. On the other hand, the 
     collaborative mechanisms in place in a network that supports 
     IP/MPLS over TDM switching could be described as vertical and 
     horizontal integration in the case where each network belongs to 
     a separate area.

     belong to the same or different regions. In the latter case the 
     network is also a multi-region network. The concept of data 
     plane layer is by nature hierarchical. L2 and L1 are defined as 
     higher and lower layers respectively in Figure 1. Network 
     elements with different switching capabilities in the MLN are 
     controlled by a unified (that is, a single) GMPLS control plane.

  4.1.   Interface Switching Capability 
      
     The Interface Switching Capability (ISC) is introduced in GMPLS 
     to support various kinds of switching technology in a unified 
     way [GMPLS-ROUTING]. An ISC is identified via a switching type. 
      
     A switching type (also referred to as the switching capability 
     types) describes the ability of a node to forward data of a 
     particular data plane technology, and uniquely identifies a 
     network region. The following ISC types (and, hence, regions) 
     are defined: PSC, L2SC, TDM, LSC, and FSC. Each end of a data 
     link (more precisely, each interface connecting a data link to a 
     node) in a GMPLS network is associated with an ISC. For example, 
     packet switch capable (PSC) is a property of an interface, which 
     can distinguish IP/MPLS packets (for example, a router's 
     interface) while lambda switch capable (LSC) is a property of an 
     interface which models the switching of individual wavelengths 
     multiplexed within a fiber link (for example, an OXC's 
     interface). 
      
     The ISC value is advertised as a part of the Interface Switching 
     Capability Descriptor (ISCD) attribute (sub-TLV) of a TE link 
     end associated with a particular link interface. Apart from the 
     ISC, the ISCD contains information, such as the encoding type, 
     the bandwidth granularity, and the unreserved bandwidth on each 
     of eight priorities at which LSPs can be established. 
   
  4.2.   Multiple Interface Switching Capabilities 
      
     In a MLN, network elements may be single-switching or multi-
     switching type capable nodes. Single-switching type capable 
     nodes advertise the same ISC value as part of their ISCD sub-
     TLV(s) to describe the termination capabilities of their TE 
     Link(s). This case is described in [GMPLS-ROUTING].  
      
     Multi-switching capable LSRs are classified as "simplex" and 
     "hybrid" nodes. Simplex and Hybrid nodes are categorized 
     according to the way they advertise these multiple ISCs: 
      
     - A simplex node can terminate links with different switching 
     capabilities each of them connected to the node by a single link 
     interface. So, it advertises several TE Links each with a single 
     ISC value as part of its ISCD sub-TLVs. For example, an LSR with 
     PSC and TDM links each of which is connected to the LSR via 
     single interface. 
      
     - A hybrid node can terminate links with different switching 
     capabilities terminating on the same interface. So, it 
     advertises at least one TE Link containing more than one ISCDs 
     with different ISC values. For example, a node comprising of PSC 
     and TDM links, which are interconnected via internal links. The 
     external interfaces connected to the node have both PSC and TDM 
     capability.

     Additionally TE link advertisements issued by a simplex or a 
     hybrid node may need to advertise the internal node's link 
     adaptation capabilities. That is, the node's capability to 
     perform layer border node functions. The necessity of such 
     advertisements will be described later in separate document.  
     Networks with single switching capable nodes 
      
  4.2.1.     Networks with single-switching capable nodes  
      
     In this case, the network consists of a set of single-switching 
     capable nodes, with at least two distinct switching capabilities 
     in the network. For instance, nodes in Figure 3 are all single 
     switching capable. There are two switching capabilities in the 
     network: PCS and LSC.

                Figure 3: Network wit single-switching capable nodes 
      
  4.2.2.     Networks with multi-switching capable simplex nodes  
      
     In this case, the network consists of at least one simplex node 
     and includes a set of single switching type capable nodes (that 
     is, all TE links terminating on such nodes have the same ISC).  
      
     For example, the node TL2 in Figure 4 is a simplex node, which 
     has data links with TDM switching type interfaces and data links 
     with lambda switching type interfaces. 
      
     At the layer boundary, the ISCs of the opposite ends of the 
     links are different. When an LSP crosses the boundary (for 
     example, an LSP from P2 to P4) from the upper layer to the lower 
     layer, it is nested in a lower-layer hierarchical LSP (for 
     example, an LSP from TL2 to T4).

  4.2.3.     Networks with multi-switching capable hybrid nodes 
      
     In this case, the network contains at least one hybrid node, 
     zero or more simplex nodes, and a set of single switching 
     capable nodes. 
       
     Figure 5a shows an example hybrid node. The hybrid node has two 
     switching elements (matrices), which support, for instance, TDM 
     and PSC switching respectively. The node terminates two TDM 
     links (Link1 and Link2), which are connected to the TDM 
     switching element by interfaces that model TDM switching.  
      
     The two switching elements are internally interconnected in such 
     a way that it is possible to terminate some of the resources of, 
     say, Link1 and provide through them adaptation for PSC traffic 
     received/sent over the PSC links. This situation is modeled in 
     GMPLS by connecting the local end of Link1 to the TDM switching 
     element via an additional interface realizing the 
     termination/adaptation function.

     Let's assume that all interfaces are STM64 (with VC4-16c capable  
     as Max LSP bandwidth). So, initially, TE Link 1 is  
     advertised with two ISCD sub-TLVs:  
     - ISCD #1 sub-TLV: TDM with Max LSP bandwidth = STM16 (i.e. VC4-
     16c capable as Max LSP bandwidth) and Unreserved bandwidth (of 
     the whole incoming link) = STM64  
     - ISCD #2 sub-TLV: PSC with Max LSP bandwidth = 2.5 Gb (i.e.     
     and Unreserved bandwidth (of the whole incoming link) = 10 Gb  
      
     After, setting up several PSC LSPs via port #b1 qnd terminating 
     several TDM LSPs via port #b2 (and #d), there is only 155 Mb 
     capacity still available on port #d. However a 622 Mb capacity 
     remains on port b1 and VC4-5x capacity in port b2. TE Link 1 is 
     now advertised with the following ISCD sub-TLVs:  
     - ISCD #1 sub-TLV: TDM with Max LSP bandwidth = VC4-4c, the   
     Unreserved bandwidth reflects the VC4-5c capacity still   
     available for the whole link 
     - ISCD #2 sub-TLV: PSC with Max LSP bandwidth = 622 Mb, the  
     Unreserved bandwidth reflects the capacity still available for   
     the whole link i.e. 777 Mb.  
      
     When computing the path for a new VC4-4c TDM LSP, one cannot 
     know, based on existing GMPLS routing advertisements (i.e. two 
     ISCD sub-TLVs), that this node cannot be used to setup this LSP 
     terminated on port #d, as there is only 155M still available for 
     TDM-PSC adaptation. Thus, in that case additional routing 
     information is required to advertise the available TDM-PSC 
     internal adaptation resources (i.e. 155 Mb here).

  4.3.   Integrated Traffic Engineering (TE) and Resource Control  
      
     In GMPLS-based multi-region/multi-layer networks, TE Links are 
     consolidated into a single Traffic Engineering Database (TED). 
     Since this TED contains the information relative to all the 
     layers of all regions in the network, a path across multiple 
     layers (possibly crossing multiple regions) can be computed 
     using the information in this TED. Thus optimization of network 
     resources across the multiple layers of the same region and 
     multiple regions can be achieved.  
      
     These concepts allow for the operation of one network layer over 
     the topology (that is, TE links) provided by other network 
     layer(s) (for example, the use of a lower layer LSC LSP carrying 
     PSC LSPs). In turn, a greater degree of control and inter-
     working can be achieved, including (but not limited too):  
     - dynamic establishment of Forwarding Adjacency LSPs (see 
     Section 4.3.3)  
     - provisioning of end-to-end LSPs with dynamic triggering of FA 
     LSPs 
      
     Note that in a multi-layer/multi-region network that includes 
     multi-switching type capable nodes, an explicit route used to 
     establish an end-to-end LSP can specify nodes that belong to 
     different layers or regions. In this case, a mechanism to 
     control the dynamic creation of FA LSPs may be required. 
      
     There is a full spectrum of options to control how FA LSPs are 
     dynamically established. It can be subject to the control of a 
     policy, which may be set by a management component, and which 
     may require that the management plane is consulted at the time 
     that the FA LSP is established. Alternatively, the FA LSP can be 
     established at the request of the control plane without any 
     management control.  
      
  4.3.1.     Triggered signaling  
      
     When an LSP crosses the boundary from an upper to a lower layer, 
     it may be nested into a lower layer FA LSP that crosses the 
     lower layer. If such an LSP does not already exist, the LSP may 
     be established dynamically. Such a mechanism is referred to as 
     "triggered signaling".  
      
  4.3.2.      FA-LSP 
      
     Once an LSP is created across a layer, it can be used as a data 
     link in an upper layer.  
      
     Furthermore, it can be advertised as a TE-link, allowing other 
     nodes to consider the LSP as a TE link for their path 
     computation [HIER]. An LSP created dynamically by one instance 
     of the control plane and advertised as a TE link into the same 
     instance of the control plane is called a FA-LSP. An FA has the

     between its ends yet still guaranteeing control plane 
     connectivity between the FA-LSP ends. FA is a useful and 
     powerful tool for improving the scalability of GMPLS Traffic 
     Engineering (TE) capable networks. 
      
     The aggregation of LSPs enables the creation of a vertical 
     (nested) LSP Hierarchy. A set of FA-LSPs across or within a 
     lower layer can be used during path selection by a higher layer 
     LSP. Likewise, the higher layer LSPs may be carried over dynamic 
     data links realized via LSPs (just as they are carried over any 
     "regular" static data links). This process requires the nesting 
     of LSPs through a hierarchical process [HIER]. The TED contains 
     a set of LSP advertisements from different layers that are 
     identified by the ISCD contained within the TE link 
     advertisement associated with the LSP [GMPLS-ROUTING]. Note that 
     ISCD contains the switching type (i.e. interface switching 
     capability), the data encoding type, and the bandwidth 
     granularity. 
       
  4.3.3.     Virtual network topology (VNT)  
      
     A set of lower-layer LSPs provides information for efficient 
     path handling in upper-layer(s) of the MLN, or, in other words, 
     provides a virtual network topology to the upper-layers. For 
     instance, a set of LSPs, each of which is supported by an LSC 
     LSP, provides a virtual network topology to the layers of a PSC 
     region, assuming that the PSC region is connected to the LSC 
     region. The virtual network topology is configured by setting up 
     or tearing down the LSC LSPs. By using GMPLS signaling and 
     routing protocols, the virtual network topology can be easily 
     adapted to traffic demands. 
      
     By reconfiguring the virtual network topology according to the 
     traffic demand between source and destination node pairs, 
     network performance factors, such as maximum link utilization 
     and residual capacity of the network, can be optimized [MAMLTE]. 
     Reconfiguration is performed by computing the new VNT from the 
     traffic demand matrix and optionally from the current VNT. Exact 
     details are outside the scope of this document. However, this 
     method may be tailored according to the Service Provider's 
     policy regarding network performance and quality of service 
     (delay, loss/disruption, utilization, residual capacity, 
     reliability). 
      
  5. Requirements  
      
  5.1.   Scalability  
      
     The MRN/MLN relies on a unified traffic engineering and routing 
     model. The TED in each LSR is populated with TE-links from all 
     layers of all regions. This may lead to a huge amount of 
     information that has to be flooded and stored within the network. 
     Furthermore, path computation times, which may be of great

     importance during restoration, will depend on the size of the 
     TED.  
      
     Thus MRN/MLN routing mechanisms MUST be designed to scale well 
     with an increase of any of the following:  
      - Number of nodes  
      - Number of TE-links (including FA-LSPs)  
      - Number of LSPs  
      - Number of regions and layers 
      - Number of ISCDs per TE-link. 
      
  5.2.   LSP resource utilization  
      
     It MUST be possible to utilize network resources efficiently. 
     Particularly, resource usage in each layer SHOULD be optimized 
     as a whole (i.e. across all layers), in a coordinated manner. 
     The number of lower-layer LSPs carrying upper-layer LSPs SHOULD 
     be minimized. Redundant lower-layer LSPs SHOULD be avoided 
     (except for protection purpose).  
      
  5.2.1.     FA-LSP release and setup 
      
     Statistical multiplexing can only be employed in PSC and L2SC 
     regions. A PSC or L2SC LSP may or may not consume the maximum 
     reservable bandwidth of the FA LSP that carries it. On the other 
     hand, a TDM, or LSC LSP always consumes a fixed amount of 
     bandwidth as long as it exists (and is fully instantiated) 
     because statistical multiplexing is not available.  
      
     If there is low traffic demand, some FA LSPs, which do not carry 
     any LSP may be released so that resources are released. Note 
     that if a small fraction of the available bandwidth is still 
     under use, the nested LSPs can also be re-routed optionally 
     using the make-before-break technique. Alternatively, the FA 
     LSPs may be retained for future usage. Release or retention of 
     underutilized FA LSPs is a policy decision.  
       
     As part of the re-optimization process, the solution MUST allow 
     rerouting of FA LSPs while keeping interface identifiers of 
     corresponding TE links unchanged.  
      
     Additional FA LSPs MAY also be created based on policy, which 
     might consider residual resources and the change of traffic 
     demand across the region. By creating the new FA LSPs, the 
     network performance such as maximum residual capacity may be 
     improved.  
      
     As the number of FA LSPs grows, the residual resource may 
     decrease. In this case, re-optimization of FA LSPs MAY be 
     invoked according the policy.  
      
     Any solution MUST include measures to protect against network 
     destabilization caused by the rapid set up and tear down of LSPs 
     as traffic demand varies near a threshold.

  5.2.2.     Virtual TE-Link 
      
     It may be considered disadvantageous to fully instantiate (i.e. 
     pre-provision) the set of lower layer LSPs since this may 
     reserve bandwidth that could be used for other LSPs in the 
     absence of the upper-layer traffic.  
      
     However, in order to provision upper-layer LSPs across the 
     lower-layer, the LSPs MAY still be advertised into the upper-
     layer as though they had been fully established. Such TE links 
     that represent the possibility of an underlying LSP are termed 
     "virtual TE-link". Note that this is not a mandatory (MUST) 
     requirement since even if there are no LSPs advertised to the 
     higher layer, it is possible to route an upper layer LSP into a 
     lower layer based on the lower layer's TE-links and making 
     assumptions that proper hierarchical LSPs in the lower layer 
     will be dynamically created as needed. 
      
     If an upper-layer LSP makes use of a virtual TE-Link is set up, 
     the underlying LSP MUST be immediately signaled in the lower 
     layer if it has not been established.  
      
     If virtual TE-Links are used in place of pre-established LSPs, 
     the TE links across the upper-layer can remain stable using pre-
     computed paths while wastage of bandwidth within the lower-layer 
     and unnecessary reservation of adaptation ports at the border 
     nodes can be avoided.  
      
     The concept of VNT can be extended to allow the virtual TE-links 
     to form part of the VNT. The combination of the fully 
     provisioned TE-links and the virtual TE-links defines the VNT 
     across the lower layer.  
      
     The solution SHOULD provide operations to facilitate the build-
     up of such virtual TE-links, taking into account the (forecast) 
     traffic demand and available resource in the lower-layer.  
      
     Virtual TE-links MAY be modified dynamically (by adding or 
     removing virtual TE links) according to the change of the 
     (forecast) traffic demand and the available resource in the 
     lower-layer.  
      
     Any solution MUST include measures to protect against network 
     destabilization caused by the rapid changes in the virtual 
     network topology as traffic demand varies near a threshold. 
      
     The VNT can be changed by setting up and/or tearing down virtual 
     TE links as well as by modifying real links (i.e. the fully 
     provisioned LSPs).  
      
     The maximum number of virtual TE links that can be configured 
     SHOULD be well-engineered.

     How to design the VNT and how to manage it are out of scope of 
     this document and will be treated in a companion document on 
     solution. 
      
  5.3.   LSP Attribute inheritance  
      
     TE-Link parameters SHOULD be inherited from the parameters of 
     the LSP that provides the TE link, and so from the TE links in 
     the lower layer that are traversed by the LSP.  
     These include:  
     - Interface Switching Capability  
     - TE metric  
     - Maximum LSP bandwidth per priority level  
     - Unreserved bandwidth for all priority levels   
     - Maximum Reservable bandwidth  
     - Protection attribute  
     - Minimum LSP bandwidth (depending on the Switching Capability)  
      
     Inheritance rules MUST be applied based on specific policies. 
     Particular attention should be given to the inheritance of TE 
     metric (which may be other than a strict sum of the metrics of 
     the component TE links at the lower layer) and protection 
     attributes.  
      
  5.4.   Verification of the LSP  
      
     When the LSP is created, it SHOULD be verified that it has been 
     established before it can be used by an upper layer LSP. Note, 
     this is not within the GMPLS capability scope for non-PSC 
     interfaces. 
      
  5.5.   Disruption minimization  
      
     When reconfiguring the VNT according to a change in traffic 
     demand, the upper-layer LSP might be disrupted. Such disruption 
     MUST be minimized.  
      
     When residual resource decreases to a certain level, some LSPs 
     MAY be released according to local or network policies. There is 
     a trade-off between minimizing the amount of resource reserved 
     in the lower layer LSPs and disrupting higher layer traffic (i.e. 
     moving the traffic to other TE-LSPs so that some LSPs can be 
     released). Such traffic disruption MAY be allowed but MUST be 
     under the control of policy that can be configured by the 
     operator. Any repositioning of traffic MUST be as non-disruptive 
     as possible (for example, using make-before-break).  
      
  5.6.   Stability  
      
     The path computation is dependent on the network topology and 
     associated link state. The path computation stability of an 
     upper layer may be impaired if the VNT changes frequently and/or 
     if the status and TE parameters (TE metric for instance) of 
     links in the virtual network topology changes frequently.

     In this context, robustness of the VNT is defined as the 
     capability to smooth changes that may occur and avoid their 
     propagation into higher layers. Changes of the VNT may be caused 
     by the creation and/or deletion of several LSPs.  
      
     Creation and deletion of LSPs MAY be triggered by adjacent 
     layers or through operational actions to meet changes in traffic 
     demand. Routing robustness SHOULD be traded with adaptability 
     with respect to the change of incoming traffic requests.  
      
     A full mesh of LSPs MAY be created between every pair of border 
     nodes of the PSC region. The merit of a full mesh of PSC TE-LSPs 
     is that it provides stability to the PSC-level routing. That is, 
     the forwarding table of an PSC-LSR is not impacted by re-routing 
     changes within the lower-layer (e.g., TDM layer). Further, there 
     is always full PSC reachability and immediate access to 
     bandwidth to support PSC LSPs. But it also has significant 
     drawbacks, since it requires the maintenance of n^2 RSVP-TE 
     sessions, which may be quite CPU and memory consuming 
     (scalability impact). Also this may lead to significant 
     bandwidth wasting if LSP with a certain amount of reserved 
     bandwidth is used. 
     Note that the use of virtual TE-links solves the bandwidth 
     wasting issue, and may reduce the control plane overload. 
      
  5.7.   Computing paths with and without nested signaling  
      
     Path computation MAY take into account LSP region and layer 
     boundaries when computing a path for an LSP. For example, path 
     computation MAY restrict the path taken by an LSP to only the 
     links whose interface switching capability is PSC-1.  
      
     Interface switching capability is used as a constraint in 
     computing the path. A TDM-LSP is routed over the topology 
     composed of TE links of the same TDM layer. In calculating the 
     path for the LSP, the TE database MAY be filtered to include 
     only links where both end include requested LSP switching type. 
     In this way hierarchical routing is done by using a TE database 
     filtered with respect to switching capability (that is, with 
     respect to particular layer). 
      
     If triggered signaling is allowed, the path computation 
     mechanism MAY produce a route containing multiple layers/ 
     regions. 
      
  5.8.   Handling single-switching and multi-switching type capable 
  nodes  
      
     The MRN/MLN can consist of single-switching type capable and 
     multi-switching type capable nodes. The path computation 
     mechanism in the MLN SHOULD be able to compute paths consisting 
     of any combination of such nodes.

     Both single switching capable and multi-switching (simplex or 
     hybrid) capable nodes could play the role of layer boundary. 
     MRN/MLN Path computation SHOULD handle TE topologies built of 
     any combination of single switching, simplex and hybrid nodes  
      
  5.9.   Advertisement of the available adaptation resource  
      
     A hybrid node SHOULD maintain resources and advertise the 
     resource information on its internal links, the links required 
     for vertical (layer) integration. Likewise, path computation 
     elements SHOULD be prepared to use the availability of 
     termination/adaptation resources as a constraint in MRN/MLN path 
     computations to reduce the higher layer LSP setup blocking 
     probability because of the lack of necessary termination/ 
     adaptation resources in the lower layer(s). 
   
     The advertisement of the adaptation capability to terminate LSPs 
     of lower-region and forward traffic in the upper-region is 
     REQUIRED, as it provides critical information when performing 
     multi-region path computation.
