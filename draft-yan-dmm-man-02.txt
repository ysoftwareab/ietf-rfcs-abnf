         Mobility Capability Negotiation and Protocol Selection
                          draft-yan-dmm-man-02

Abstract

   The draft analyzes the issue that multiple mobility management
   protocols have been developed according to different requirements.
   These different protocols have different functional requirements on
   the network element or the host.  A scheme is then proposed to
   support the negotiation and selection of adopted mobility management
   protocol when a host accesses a new network.

1.  Introduction

   A large number of multiple protocols have been developed.  In order
   to clearly analyze the possible cases, these mobility management
   protocols can be categorized as follows:

   o  Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol: the mobility management scheme based
      on [RFC6275].
   o  Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) protocol: the mobility management
      scheme based on [RFC5213].
   o  MIPv6 suite protocols: based on MIPv6, there are multiple
      extension protocols have been standardized.  These protocols can
      be classified into two types: protocols for functional extension
      and protocols for performance enhancement.  The protocols for
      functional extension are proposed to support some specific
      scenarios or functions, such as Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 (DSMIPv6)
      [RFC5555] for mobility of the dual-stack nodes, Multiple Care-of-
      address (MCoA) [RFC5648] for hosts with multiple access interfaces
      and Network Mobility (NEMO) [RFC3963] for mobility of sub-network.
      The other type is proposed to enhance performance of the mobility
      management, such as Fast Mobile IPv6 (FMIP6) [RFC5268] for fast
      handover, Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) [RFC5380] for
      hierarchical mobility optimization.  In the MIPv6 suite protocols,
      location update is initiated by the host and the tunnel is also
      terminated at the host.
   o  PMIPv6 suite protocols: in order to reduce the protocol cost and
      enhance the handover performance further, the network-based
      mobility management protocols were proposed and PMIPv6 was

      standardized as a base protocol.  Based on PMIPv6, a series of its
      extensions were proposed, such as Dual-stack Proxy Mobile IPv6
      (DS-PMIPv6) [RFC5844], and Distributed Mobility Management Proxy
      Mobile IPv6 (DMM-PMIPv6) [RFC7333].  Being different from the
      MIPv6 suite protocols, the location update in PMIPv6 suite
      protocols is triggered by the network entity and the tunnel is
      established between network entities.  Then the host needs to do
      nothing about signaling exchange during the movement,
      particularly, the mobility support is transparent to the IP layer
      of the host.
   o  Network-based protocols: generally, they refer to the mobility
      management protocols which do not require the involvement of the
      host to support mobility.  They include the PMIPv6 suite protocols
      and other network-based solutions, such as GPRS Tunnelling
      Protocol (GTP) [TS.29274][TS.29281].
   o  Host-based protocols: generally, they refer to the mobility
      management protocols which require the involvement of the host in
      order to support mobility.  They include the MIPv6 suite protocols
      and other host-based solutions, such as Host Identity Protocol
      (HIP) [RFC7401] and IKEv2 Mobility and Multihoming Protocol
      (MOBIKE) [RFC4555].

   Figure 1 illustrates the scopes of the above different categories.

             Figure 1: Scopes of different protocol categories

   In deployment, the host-based protocols and network-based protocols
   will be co-existing and multiple protocol deamons will be configured
   on the network entities or host.  There is then a gap in how to
   determine which protocol to use.  A scheme is therefore needed to
   support the negotiation and selection of mobility management protocol
   when the host initially attaches or hands over to a new network
   [Paper-CombiningMobilityStandards].

   This document tries to present the principles for the protocol
   selection and analyze the possible scenarios which should be
   supported by the subsequent mobility solution.

2.  Motivations

   As illustrated above, these protocols may co-exist in practice and
   may simultaneously be used in an access network or even the same
   entity.  Due to their different requirements on the network entity or
   host, a scheme is needed to support the negotiation and selection of
   adopted mobility management protocol when the host accesses to a new
   network.  Generally, two problems should be solved:

   o  What principles should be followed for the protocol negotiation
      and selection?
   o  What procedure should be adopted for the protocol negotiation and
      selection?

   This scheme is needed because the network entity and the host may
   have different capabilities and preferences (may be decided by the
   capability and mobility pattern of the host).  This scheme aims to
   guarantee that the optimum and most suitable protocol will be used.

3.  Possible Cases

   From both host and network aspects, there are multiple cases in their
   capacities of mobility management as shown in Figure 2.  We mainly
   analyze the cases where that host and network support a single
   protocol.  If multiple protocols are supported simultaneously by the
   host or network side, multiple cases exist at the same time but the
   logic is the same as that in the case with single protocol supported.
   Specifically, the following cases should be considered.

   1) Network supports network-based protocol, host supports network-
   based protocol

   In this case, there are the following sub-cases:

   a) Host supports PMIPv6 suite protocol, Network supports PMIPv6 suite
   protocol

   o  if host supports PMIPv6 and network supports PMIPv6, PMIPv6 will
      be selected.
   o  if host supports PMIPv6 and network supports extended PMIPv6
      protocol, extended PMIPv6 is selected if no host involvement is
      needed, otherwise the plain PMIPv6 is selected (we assume that the
      extension protocols are backward-compatible with the related plain
      protocol).
   o  if host supports extended PMIPv6 protocol and network supports
      PMIPv6, PMIPv6 is selected (we assume that the extension protocols
      are backward-compatible with the related plain protocol).

   o  if host supports extended PMIPv6 protocol and network supports
      extended PMIPv6 protocol, the identical extension protocol is
      selected, otherwise, the plain PMIPv6 is selected (we assume that
      the extension protocols are backward-compatible with the related
      plain protocol).

4.  Principles and Possible Procedure

   Two different schemes may be used for the protocol negotiation and
   selection: host-initiated and network-initiated.  Within the MIP/PMIP
   protocols, the priority of the function-extension protocols should be
   higher than the performance-enhancement protocols.  Generally, the
   following principles should be followed:

   o  Priority 1: Follow network ability
   o  Priority 2: Follow host preference
   o  Priority 3: Support the functional extensions
   o  Priority 4: Support the performance enhancements
   o  In default: network based scheme if it can be supported

   And the general procedure for the protocol selection should be:

   o  During initiation, network-based protocol may be used as a default
      mobility management protocol once the network supports it.
   o  If the host prefers host-based protocols, a negotiation is
      executed to handover from network-based protocol to host-based
      protocol.
   o  After initial attachment, a profile will be generated in the
      management store to record the selected or preferred protocol of
      this host.
   o  When the handover happens, the network will check the selected or
      preferred protocol during the authentication process.  But the
      network also needs to notify the host if the selected protocol
      cannot be supported herein.

5.  Extensions

   In order to fulfill the above principles, some extensions should be
   supported, for example:

   1) Extended negotiation messages

   The protocol negotiation may be included in the MN_ATTACH Function
   [MN-AR.IF] and the implementation may be based on a new signaling

   message or extended messages (e.g., ICMPv6, Diameter, and RADIUS).
   Besides these, some other protocols may also be used in some
   specified scenarios, such as extended IEEE 802.21 primitives.

   2) Extended management store

   When the host accesses the network, authentication should be executed
   before the mobility management service is provided.  In order to
   support the mobility management protocol selection, a new information
   should be recorded by the network after the successful authentication
   during the initial attachment.  The newly introduced information
   shows the selected mobility management protocol and should be updated
   when the used protocol changes.

6.  Security Considerations

   Generally, this function will not incur additional security issues.
   The detailed influence should be analyzed in the future.

7.  IANA Considerations

   A new ICMP option or authentication option or other signaling message
   may be used with a new code number.
