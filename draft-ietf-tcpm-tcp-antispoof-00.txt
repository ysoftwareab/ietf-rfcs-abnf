Abstract 

   Recent analysis of potential attacks on core Internet infrastructure 
   indicates an increased vulnerability of TCP connections to spurious 
   resets (RSTs).  TCP has always been susceptible to such RST spoof 
   attacks, which were indirectly protected by checking that the RST 
   sequence number was inside the current receive window, as well as via

   known endpoints often over predictable port pairs, such as BGP or 
   between web servers and well-known large-scale caches, increases in 
   the path bandwidth-delay product of a connection have sufficiently 
   increased the receive window space that off-path third parties can

1. Introduction 

   Analysis of the Internet infrastructure has been recently 
   demonstrated new version of a vulnerability in BGP connections 
   between core routers using an attack known for nearly six years 
   [3][4].  These connections, typically using TCP, can be susceptible 
   to off-path (non man-in-the-middle) third-party reset (RST) segments, 
   which terminate the TCP connection.  BGP routers react to a 
   terminated TCP connection in various ways, ranging from restarting 
   the connection to deciding that the other router is unreachable and 
   thus flushing the BGP routes.  This sort of attack affects other 
   protocols besides BGP, involving any long-lived connection between 
   well-known endpoints.  The impact on Internet infrastructure can be 
   substantial (esp. for the BGP case), and warrants immediate 
   attention. 

   TCP, like many other protocols, can be susceptible to these off-path 
   third-party attacks.  Such attacks rely on the increase of commodity 
   platforms supporting public access to previously privileged 
   resources, such as root-level access.  Given such access, it is 
   trivial for anyone to generate a packet with any header desired. 

   This, coupled with the lack of sufficient ingress filtering to drop 
   such spoofed traffic, can increase the potential for off-path third-
   party spoofing attacks.  Proposed solutions include the deployment of 
   existing Internet network and transport security as well as 
   modifications to transport protocols that reduce its vulnerability to 
   generated attacks. 

   One way to defeat spoofing is to validate the segments of a 
   connection, either at the transport level or the network level.  TCP 
   with MD5 extensions provides this authentication at the transport 
   level, and IPsec provides authentication at the network level. In 
   both cases their deployment overhead may be prohibitive, e.g., it may 
   not feasible for public services, such as web servers, to be 
   configured with the appropriate certificate authorities of large 
   numbers of peers (for IPsec using IKE), or shared secrets (for IPsec 
   in shared-secret mode, or TCP/MD5), because many clients may need to 
   be configured rapidly without external assistance.  Services from 
   public web servers connecting to large-scale caches to BGP with 
   larger numbers of peers can experience this challege.

   The remainder of this document outlines the recent attack scenario in 
   detail and describes and compares a variety of solutions, including 
   existing solutions based on TCP/MD5 and IPsec, as well as recently 
   proposed solutions, including modifications to TCP's RST processing 
   [24], modifications to TCP's timestamp processing [5], and 
   modifications to IPsec and TCP/MD5 keying [6]. 

2. Background 

   The recent analysis of potential attacks on BGP has again raised the 
   issue of TCP's vulnerability to off-path third-party spoofing attacks 
   [3].  A variety of such attacks have been known for several years, 
   including sending RSTs, SYNs, and even ACKs in an attempt to affect 
   an existing connection or to load down servers.  Overall, such 
   attacks are countered by the use of some form of authentication at 
   the network (e.g., IPsec), transport (e.g., SYN cookies, TCP/MD5), or 
   other layers.  TCP already includes a weak form of such 
   authentication in its check of segment sequence numbers against the 
   current receiver window.  Increases in the bandwidth-delay product 
   for certain long connections have sufficiently weakened this type of 
   weak authentication in recent weeks, rendering it moot. 

2.1. Recent BGP Attacks Using TCP RSTs 

   BGP represents a particular vulnerability to spoofing attacks.  Most 
   TCP connections are protected by multiple levels of obfuscation 
   except at the endpoints of the connection: 

  o Both endpoint addresses are usually not well-known; although server 
     addresses are advertised, clients are somewhat anonymous. 

  o Both port numbers are usually not well-known; the server's usually 
     is advertised (representing the service), but the client's is 
     typically sufficiently unpredictable to an off-path third-party. 

  o Valid sequence number space is not well-known. 

  o Connections are relatively short-lived and valid sequence space 
     changes, so any guess of the above information is unlikely to be 
     useful. 

   BGP represents an exception to the above criteria (though not the 
   only case).  Both endpoints are well-known, notably as part of an AS 
   path.  The destination port is typically fixed to indicate the BGP 
   service.  The source port used by a BGP router is sometimes fixed and 
   advertised to enable firewall configuration; even when not fixed, 
   there are only 65,384 valid source ports which may be exhaustively

   attacked.  Connections are long-lived, and as noted before some BGP 
   implementations interpret successive TCP connection failures as 
   routing failures, discarding the corresponding routing information. 
   As importantly and as will be shown below, the valid sequence number 
   space once thought to provide some protection has been rendered 
   useless by increasing congestion window sizes. 

2.2. TCP RST Vulnerability 

   TCP has a known vulnerability to third-party spoofed segments.  SYN 
   flooding consumes server resources in half-open connections, 
   affecting the server's ability to open new connections.  ACK spoofing 
   can cause connections to transmit too much data too quickly, creating 
   network congestion and segment loss, causing connections to slow to a 
   crawl.  In the most recent attacks on BGP, RSTs cause connections to 
   be dropped.  As noted earlier, some BGP implementations interpret TCP 
   connection termination, or a series of such failures, as a network 
   failure.  This causes routers to drop the BGP routing information 
   already exchanged, in addition to inhibiting their ongoing exchanges.  
   The result can affect routing paths throughout the Internet. 

   The dangerous effects of RSTs on TCP have been known for many years, 
   even when used by the legitimate endpoints of a connection.  TCP RSTs 
   cause the receiver to drop all connection state; because the source 
   is not required to maintain a TIME_WAIT state, such a RST can cause 
   premature reuse of address/port pairs, potentially allowing segments 
   from a previous connection to contaminate the data of a new 
   connection, known as TIME_WAIT assassination [7].  In this case, 
   assassination occurs inadvertently as the result of duplicate 
   segments from a legitimate source, and can be avoided by blocking RST 
   processing while in TIME_WAIT.  However, assassination can be useful 
   to deliberately reduce the state held at servers; this requires that 
   the source of the RSTs go into TIME_WAIT state to avoid such hazards, 
   and that RSTs are not blocked in the TIME_WAIT state [8]. 

   Firewalls and load balancers, so-called 'middleboxes', sometimes emit 
   RSTs on behalf of transited connections to optimize server 
   performance [9].  This is effectively a 'man in the middle' RST 
   attack in which the RSTs are sent for benign or beneficial intent.  
   There are numerous hazards with such use of RSTs, outlined in that 
   RFC. 

2.3. What Changed -- the Ever Opening Window 

   RSTs represent a hazard to TCP, especially when completely unchecked.  
   Fortunately, there are a number of obfuscation mechanisms that make 
   it difficult for off-path third parties to forge (spoof) valid RSTs,

   as noted earlier.  We have already shown it is easy to learn both 
   endpoint addresses and ports for some protocols, notably BGP.  The 
   final obfuscation is the segment sequence number. 

   TCP segments include a sequence number which enables out-of-order 
   receiver processing, as well as duplicate detection.  The sequence 
   number space is also used to manage congestion, and indicates the 
   index of the next byte to be transmitted or received.  For RSTs, this 
   is relevant because legitimate RSTs use the next sequence number in 
   the transmitter window, and the receiver checks that incoming RSTs 
   have a sequence number in the expected receive window.  Such 
   processing is intended to eliminate duplicate segments (somewhat moot 
   for RSTs, though), and to drop RSTs which were part of previous 
   connections. 

   TCP uses two window mechanisms, a primary mechanism which uses a 
   space of 32 bits, and a secondary mechanism which scales this window 
   [10][11].  The valid receive window is a fraction, not to exceed 
   approximately half, of this space, or ~2,000,000,000.  Under typical 
   use, the majority of TCP connections open to a very small fraction of 
   this space, e.g., 10,000-60,000(approximately 5-100 segments).  On a 
   low-loss path, the window should open to around the path bandwidth-
   delay product, including buffering delays (assume 1 packet/hop).  
   Many paths in the Internet have end-to-end bandwidths of under 1 
   Mbps, latencies under 100ms, and are under 15 hops, resulting in 
   fairly small windows as above (under 35,000 bytes).  Under these 
   conditions, and further assuming that the initial sequence number is 
   suitably (pseudo-randomly) chosen, a valid guessed sequence number 
   would have odds of 1 in 57,000.  Put differently, a blind (non man-
   in-the-middle) attacker would need to send 57,000 RSTs with suitably 
   spaced sequence number guesses to successfully reset a connection.  
   At 1 Mbps, 57,000 (40 byte) RSTs would take over 50 minutes to 
   transmit, and, as noted earlier, most current connections are fairly 
   brief by comparison. 

   Recent use of high bandwidth paths of 10 Gbps and result in 
   bandwidth-delay products over 125 MB - approximately 1/10 of TCP's 
   overall window size excluding scale, assuming the receiver allocates 
   sufficient buffering (to be discussed later).  Even under networks 
   that are ten times slower (1 Gbps), the active receiver window covers 
   1/100th of the overall window size.  At these speeds, it takes only 
   10-100 packets, or under 32 microseconds, to correctly guess a valid 
   sequence number and kill a connection.  A table of corresponding 
   exposure to various amounts of RSTs is shown below, for various line 
   rates, assuming the more conventional 100ms latencies (though even 
   100ms is large for BGP cases):

               Figure 1:   Time needed to kill a connection 

    

   This table demonstrates that the effect of bandwidth on the 
   vulnerability is squared; for every increase in bandwidth, there is a 
   linear decrease in the number of sequence number guesses needed, as 
   well as a linear decrease in the time needed to send a set of 
   guesses.  Notably, as inter-router link bandwidths approach 1 Mbps, 
   an 'exhaustive' attack becomes practical.  Checking that the RST 
   sequence number is somewhere in the valid window (bw*delay) out of 
   the overall window (2^32) is an insufficient obfuscation. 

   Note that this table makes a number of assumptions: 

   1. the overall bandwidth-delay product is relatively fixed 

   2. traffic losses are negligible (insufficient to affect the 

   3. congestion window over most of the connection) 

   4. the receive socket buffers do not limiting the receive window 

   5. the attack bandwidth is similar to the end-to-end path bandwidth 

   Of these assumptions, the last two are more notable.  The issue of 
   receive socket buffers will be addressed later.  The issue of the 
   attack bandwidth is considered reasonable as follows: 

   1. RSTs are substantially easier to send than data; they can be 
      precomputed and they are smaller than data packets (40 bytes). 

   2. although susceptible connections use somewhat less ubiquitous 
      high-bandwidth paths, the attack may be distributed, at which 
      point only the ingress link of the attack is the primary 
      limitation

   3. for the purposes of the above table, we assume that the ingress at 
      the attack has the same bandwidth as the path, as an approximation 

   The previous sections discussed the nature of the recent attacks on 
   BGP due to the vulnerability of TCP to RST spoofing attacks, due 
   largely to recent increases in the fraction of the TCP window space 
   in use for a single, long-lived connection. 

3. Proposed solutions 

   TCP currently authenticates received RSTs using the address and port 
   pair numbers, and checks that the sequence number is inside the valid 
   receiver window.  The previous section demonstrated how TCP has 
   become more vulnerable to RST spoofing attacks due to the increases 
   in the receive window size.  There are a number of current and 
   proposed solutions to this vulnerability, all attempting to increase 
   the authentication of received RSTs. 

3.1. Transport Layer Solutions 

   The transport layer represents the last place that segments can be 
   authenticated before they affect connection management.  TCP has a 
   variety of current and proposed mechanisms to increase the 
   authentication of segments, protecting against both off-path third-
   party spoofs and man-in-the-middle attacks.  SCTP also has mechanisms 
   to authenticate segments. 

3.1.1. TCP MD5 Authentication 

   An extension to TCP supporting MD5 authentication was developed 
   around six years ago specifically to authenticate BGP connections 
   (although it can be used for any TCP connection) [4].  The extension 
   relies on a pre-shared secret key to authenticate the entire TCP 
   segment, including the data, TCP header, and TCP pseudo-header 
   (certain fields of the IP header).  All segments are protected, 
   including RSTs, to be accepted only when their signature matches.  
   This option, although widely deployed in Internet routers, is 
   considered undeployable for widespread use because the need for pre-
   shared keys.  It further is considered computationally expensive for 
   either hosts or routers due to the overhead of MD5 [12][13]. 

3.1.2. TCP RST Window Attenuation 

   A recent proposal extends TCP to further constrain received RST to 
   match the expected next sequence number [24].  This restores TCP's 
   resistance to spurious RSTs, effectively limiting the receive window 
   for RSTs to a single number.  As a result, an attacker would need to 
 
 
Touch                  Expires August 13, 2005                 [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft  Defending TCP Against Spoofing Attacks    February 2005 
                                    

   send 2^32 different packets to correctly guess the sequence number. 
   The extension further modifies the RST receiver to react to 
   incorrectly-numbered RSTs, by sending a zero-length ACK.  If the RST 
   source is legitimate, upon receipt of an ACK the closed source would 
   presumably emit a RST with the sequence number matching the ACK, 
   correctly resetting the intended recipient.  This modification adds 
   arcs to the TCP state diagram, adding to its complexity and thus 
   potentially affecting its correctness (in contrast to adding MD5 
   signatures, which is orthogonal to the state machine altogether).  
   For example, there may be complications between RSTs of different 
   connections between the same pair of endpoints because RSTs flush the 
   TIME-WAIT (as mentioned earlier).  Further, this modifies TCP so that 
   under some circumstances a RST causes a reply, in violation of 
   generally accepted practice, if not gentle recommendation.  The 
   advantage to this proposal is that it can be deployed incrementally 
   and has benefit to the endpoint on which it is deployed. 

   A variant of this proposal uses a different value to attenuate the 
   window of viable RSTs.  It requires RSTs to carry the initial 
   sequence number rather than the next expected sequence number, i.e., 
   the value negotiated on connection establishment [15].  This proposal 
   has the advantage of using an explicitly negotiated value, but at the 
   cost of changing the behavior of an unmodified endpoint to a 
   currently valid RST.  It would thus be more difficult, without 
   additional mechanism, to deploy incrementally. 

   The most obvious other variant of this proposal involves increasing 
   TCP's window space, rather than decreasing the valid range for RSTs, 
   i.e., increasing the sequence space from 32 bits to 64 bits.  This 
   has the equivalent effect - the ratio of the valid sequence numbers 
   for any segment to the overall sequence number space is significantly 
   reduced.  The use of the larger space, as with current schemes to 
   establish weak authentication using initial sequence numbers (ISNs), 
   is contingent on using suitably random values for the ISN.  Such 
   randomness adds additional complexity to TCP both in specification 
   and implementation, and provides only very weak authentication.  Such 
   a modification is not obviously backward compatible, and would be 
   thus difficult to deploy. 

3.1.3. TCP Timestamp Authentication 

   Another way to authenticate TCP segments is to utilize its timestamp 
   option, using the value as a sort of authentication [5].  This 
   requires that the receiver TCP discard values whose timestamp is 
   outside the accepted window, which is derived from the timestamps of 
   other packets from the same connection.  This technique uses an 
   existing TCP option, but also requires modified RST processing and 
 
 
Touch                  Expires August 13, 2005                 [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft  Defending TCP Against Spoofing Attacks    February 2005 
                                    

   may be difficult to deploy incrementally without further 
   modifications.  Additionally, the timestamp value may be easier to 
   guess because it is derived from a predictable value. 

3.1.4. Other TCP Cookies 

   All of the above techniques are variants of cookies, otherwise 
   meaningless data whose value is used to validate the packet.  In the 
   case of MD5 checksums, the cookie is computed based on a shared 
   secret.  Note that even a signature can be guessed, and presents a 1 
   in 2^(signature length) probability of attack.  The primary 
   difference is that MD5 signatures are effectively one-time cookies, 
   not predictable based on man-in-the-middle snooping, because they are 
   dependent on packet data and thus do not repeat.  Window attenuation 
   sequence numbers can be guessed by snooping the sequence number of 
   current packets, and timestamps can may be guessed even more 
   remotely.  These variants of cookies are similar in spirit to TCP SYN 
   cookies, again patching a vulnerability to off-path third-party 
   spoofing attacks based on a (fairly weak, excepting MD5) form of 
   authentication.  Another form of cookie is the source port itself, 
   which can be randomized but provides only 16 bits of protection 
   (65,000 combinations), which may be exhaustively attacked. This can 
   be combined with destination port randomization as well, but that 
   would require a separate coordination mechanism (so both parties know 
   which ports to use), which is equivalent to (and as infeasible for 
   large-scale deployments as) exchanging a shared secret. 

3.1.5. Other TCP Considerations 

   The analysis of the potential for RST spoofing above assumes that the 
   receive window opens to the maximum extent suggested by the 
   bandwidth-delay product of the end-to-end path, and that the window 
   opens to an appreciable fraction of the overall sequence number 
   space.  As noted earlier, for most common cases, connections are too 
   brief or over bandwidths too low to for such a large window to occur. 
   Expanding TCP's sequence number space is a direct way to further 
   avoid such vulnerability, even for long connections over emerging 
   bandwidths. 

   Finally, it is often sufficient for the endpoint to limit the receive 
   window in other ways, notably using 'socket options'.  If the receive 
   socket buffer is limited, e.g., to the ubiquitous default of 65KB, 
   the receive window cannot grow to vulnerable sizes even for very long 
   connections over very high bandwidths.  The consequence is lower 
   sustained throughput, where only one window's worth of data per round 
   trip time (RTT) is exchanged.  Although this will keep the connection 
   open longer, it also reduces the receive window; for long-lived

   connections with continuous sourced data, this may continue to 
   present an attack opportunity, albeit a sparse and slow-moving 
   target.  For the most recent case where BGP data is being exchanged 
   between Internet routers, the data is bursty and the aggregate 
   traffic is small (i.e., unlikely to cover a substantial portion of 
   the sequence space, even if long-lived), so is difficult to consider 
   where smaller receive buffers would not sufficiently address the 
   immediate problem. 

3.1.6. Other Transport Protocol Solutions 

   Segment authentication has been addressed at the transport layer in 
   other protocols.  Both SCTP and DCCP* include cookies for connection 
   establishment and uses them to authenticate a variety of other 
   control messages [16][25].  The inclusion of such mechanism at the 
   transport protocol, although emerging as standard practice, 
   unnecessarily complicates the design and implementation of new 
   protocols.  As new attacks are discovered (SYN floods, RSTs, etc.), 
   each protocol must be modified individually to compensate.  A network 
   solution may be more appropriate and efficient. 

   *[AUTH - DCCP may be removing cookies from the spec for the 
   redundancies discussed above, because the use of cookies at the 
   transport layer primarily supports dynamic multihoming (a design goal 
   of SCTP, but not DCCP) rather than security.] 

3.2. Network Layer (IP) Solutions 

   TCP is susceptible to RSTs, but also to other spoofing and man-in-
   the-middle attacks, including SYN attacks.  Other transport 
   protocols, such as UDP and RTP are equally susceptible.  Although 
   emerging transport protocols attempt to defeat such attacks at the 
   transport layer, such attacks take advantage of network layer 
   identity spoofing.  The packet is coming from an endpoint who is 
   spoofing another endpoint, either upstream or somewhere else in the 
   Internet.  IPsec was designed specifically to establish and enforce 
   authentication of a packet's source and contents, to most directly 
   and explicitly addresses this security vulnerability. 

   The larger problem with IPsec is that of CA key distribution and use. 
   IPsec is often cumbersome, and has only recently been supported in 
   many end-system operating systems.  More importantly, it relies on 
   signed X.509 certificates to establish and exchange keying 
   information (e.g., via IKE).  These present challenges when using 
   IPsec to secure traffic to a well-known server, whose clients may not 
   support IPsec or may not have registered with a previously-known 
   certificate authority (CA).

4. Issues 

   There are a number of existing and proposed solutions addressing the 
   vulnerability of transport protocols in general, and TCP in specific, 
   to off-path third-party spoofing attacks.  As shown, these operate at 
   the transport or network layer.  Transport solutions require separate 
   modification of each transport protocol, addressing network identity 
   spoofing separately in the context of each transport association.  
   Network solutions are computationally intensive and require pervasive 
   registration of certificate authorities with every possible endpoint.  
   This section explains these observations further. 

4.1. Transport Layer (e.g., TCP) 

   Transport solutions rely on shared cookies to authenticate segments, 
   including data, transport header, and even pseudo-header (e.g., fixed 
   portions of the outer IP header in TCP).  Because the Internet relies 
   on stateless network protocols, it makes sense to rely on state 
   establishment and maintenance available in some transport layers not 
   only for the connection but for authentication state.  Three-way 
   handshakes and heartbeats can be used to negotiate authentication 
   state in conjunction with connection parameters, which can be stored 
   with connection state easily. 

   As noted earlier, transport layer solutions require separate 
   modification of all transport protocols to include authentication. 
   Not all transport layers support negotiated endpoint state (e.g., 
   UDP), and legacy protocols have been notoriously difficult to safely 
   augment.  Not all authentication solutions are created equal either, 
   and relying on a variety of transport solutions exposes end-systems 
   to increased potential for incorrectly specified or implemented 
   solutions.  Transport authentication has often been developed piece-
   wise, in response to specific attacks, e.g., SYN cookies and RST 
   window attenuation [17][24]. 

   Transport layer solutions are not only per-protocol, but often per-
   connection.  Each connection needs to negotiate and maintain 
   authentication state separately.  Overhead is not amortized over 
   multiple connections - this includes overheads in packet exchanges, 
   design complexity, and implementation complexity.  Finally, because 
   the authentication happens later in packet processing than is 
   required, additional endpoint resources may be needlessly consumed, 
   e.g., in demultiplexing received packets, indexing connection 
   identifiers, etc., only to be dropped later at the transport layer.

4.2. Network Layer (IP) 

   A network layer solution avoids the hazards of multiple transport 
   variants, using a single shared endpoint authentication mechanism 
   early in receiver packet processing to discard unauthenticated 
   packets quickly.  Network solutions protect all transport protocols, 
   including both legacy and emerging protocols, and reduce the 
   complexity of these protocols as well.  A shared solution also 
   reduces protocol overhead, and decouples the management (and 
   refreshing) of authentication state from that of individual transport 
   connections.  Finally, a network layer solution protects not only the 
   transport layer but the network layer as well, e.g., from ICMP, IGMP, 
   etc., spoofing attacks. 

   The ubiquitous protocol for network layer authentication is IPsec 
   [18][26].  IPsec specifies the overall architecture, including header 
   authentication (AH) [19][27] and encapsulation (ESP) modes [20].  AH 
   authenticates both the IP header and IP data, whereas ESP 
   authenticates only the IP data (e.g., transport header and payload). 
   AH is deprecated since ESP is more efficient and the SPI includes 
   sufficient information to verify the IP header anyway.  These two 
   modes describe the security applied to individual packets within the 
   IPsec system; key exchange and management is performed either out-of-
   band (via pre-shared keys) or by an automated key exchange protocol 
   IKE [21][28]. 

   IPsec already provides authentication of an IP header and its data 
   contents sufficient to defeat both man-in-the-middle and off-path 
   third-party spoofing attacks.  IKE can configure authentication 
   between two endpoints on a per-endpoint, per-protocol, or per-
   connection basis, as desired.  IKE also can perform automatic 
   periodic re-keying, further defeating crypto-analysis based on 
   snooping (clandestine data collection).  The use of IPsec is already 
   commonly strongly recommended for protected infrastructure. 

   IPsec is not appropriate for many deployments.  It is computationally 
   intensive both in key management and individual packet authentication 
   [12].  As importantly, IKE is not anonymous; keys can be exchanged 
   between parties only if they trust each others' X.509 certificates or 
   pre-share a key.  These certificates provide identification (the 
   other party knows who you are) only where the certificates themselves 
   are signed by certificate authorities (CAs) that both parties already 
   trust.  To a large extent, the CAs themselves are the pre-shared keys 
   which help IKE establish security association keys, which are then 
   used in the authentication algorithms.

   IPsec, although widely available both in commercial routers and 
   commodity end-systems, is not often utilized except between parties 
   that already have a preexisting relationship (employee/employer, 
   between two ISPs, etc.) Servers to anonymous clients (e.g., customer/ 
   business) or more open services (e.g., BGP, where routers may large 
   numbers of peers) are unmanageable, due to the breadth and flux of 
   CAs.  New endpoints cannot establish IPsec associations with such 
   servers unless their certificate is signed by a CA already trusted by 
   the server.  Different servers - even within the same overall system 
   (e.g., BGP) - often cannot or will not trust overlapping subsets of 
   CAs in general. 

4.3. Application Layer 

   There are a number of application layer authentication mechanisms, 
   often implicit within end-to-end encryption.  Application-layer 
   security (e.g., TLS, SSH, or MD5 checksums within a BGP stream) 
   provides the ultimate protection of application data from all 
   intermediaries, including network routers as well as exposure at 
   other layers in the end-systems.  This is the only way to ultimately 
   protect the application data. 

   Application authentication cannot protect either the network or 
   transport protocols from spoofing attacks, however.  Spoofed packets 
   interfere with network processing or reset transport connections 
   before the application checks the data.  Authentication needs to 
   winnow these packets and drop them before they interfere at these 
   lower layers. 

4.4. Shim Transport/Application Layer 

   Security can also be provided over the transport layer but below the 
   application layer, in a kind of 'shim' protocol, such as SSL or TLS. 
   These protocols provide data protection for a variety of applications 
   over a single, legacy transport protocol, such as SSL/TCP for HTTPS. 
   Unfortunately, as with application authentication, they do not 
   protect the transport layer against spoofing attacks. 

4.5. Link Layer 

   Link layer security operates separately on each hop of an Internet. 
   Such security can be critical in protecting link resources, such as 
   bandwidth and link management protocols.  Protection at this layer 
   cannot suffice for network or transport layers, because it cannot 
   authenticate the endpoint source of a packet.  Link authentication 
   ensures only the source of the current link hop where it is examined.

4.6. Conclusion 

   The issues raised in this section suggest that there are challenges 
   with all solutions to transport protection from spoofing attacks. 
   This raises the potential need for alternate security levels.  While 
   it is already widely recognized that security needs to occur 
   simultaneously at many protocol layers, the also may be utility in 
   supporting a variety of strengths at a single layer.  For example, 
   IPsec already supports a variety of algorithms (MD5, SHA, etc.  for 
   authentication), but always assumes that: 

   1. the entire body of the packet is secured 

   2. security associations are established only where identity is   
      authenticated by a know certificate authority or other pre-shared   
      key 

   3. both man-in-the-middle and off-path third-party spoofing attacks   
      must be defeated 

   These assumptions are prohibitive, especially in many cases of 
   spoofing attacks.  For spoofing, the primary issue is whether packets 
   are coming from the same party the server can reach.  Only the IP 
   header is fundamentally in question, so securing the entire packet 
   (1) is computational overkill.  It is sufficient to authenticate the 
   other party as "a party you have exchanged packets with", rather than 
   establishing their trusted identity ("Bill" vs.  "Bob") as in (2). 
   Finally, many cookie systems use clear-text (unencrypted), fixed 
   cookie values, providing reasonable (1 in 2^{cookie-size}) protection 
   against off-path third-party spoofs, but not addressing man-in-the-
   middle at all. Such potential solutions are discussed in the ANONsec 
   document, in the BTNS (Better Than Nothing Security) BOF [2][6]. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This entire document focuses on increasing the security of transport 
   protocols and their resistance to spoofing attacks.  Security is 
   addressed throughout. 

   This document describes a number of techniques for defeating spoofing 
   attacks.  Those relying on clear-text cookies, either explicit or 
   implicit (e.g., window sequence attenuation) do not protect from man-
   in-the-middle spoofing attacks, since valid values can be learned 
   from prior traffic.  Those relying on true authentication algorithms 
   are stronger, protecting even from man-in-the-middle, because the 
   authentication hash in a single packet approaches the behavior of 
   "one time" cookies.

   The security of various levels of the protocol stack is addressed. 
   Spoofing attacks are fundamentally identity masquerading, so we 
   believe the most appropriate solutions defeat these at the network 
   layer, where end-to-end identity lies.  Some transport protocols 
   subsume endpoint identity information from the network layer (e.g., 
   TCP pseudo-headers), whereas others establish per-connection identity 
   based on exchanged nonces (e.g., SCTP).  It is reasonable, if not 
   recommended, to address security at all layers of the protocol stack. 

6. Conclusions 

   This document describes the details of the recent BGP spoofing 
   attacks involving spurious RSTs which could be used to shutdown TCP 
   connections.  It summarizes and discusses a variety of current and 
   proposed solutions at various protocol layers. 

7. Acknowledgments 

   This document was inspired by discussions on the 
   <http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/tcpm-charter.html> about the 
   recent spoofed RST attacks on BGP routers, including R. Stewart's 
   draft [15][24].  The analysis of the attack issues, alternate 
   solutions, and the anonymous security proposed solutions were the 
   result of discussions on that list as well as with USC/ISI's T. 
   Faber, A.  Falk, G.  Finn, and Y.  Wang.  Ran Atkinson suggested the 
   UDP variant of TCP/MD5, and Paul Goyette suggested using the ISN to 
   seed TCP/MD5.  Other improvements are due to the input of various 
   members of the IETF's TCPM WG.
