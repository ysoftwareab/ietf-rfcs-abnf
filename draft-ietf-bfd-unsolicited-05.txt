   registration by the other side (subject to certain per-interface or
   per-router policies).

1.  Introduction

   The current implementation and deployment practice for BFD ([RFC5880]
   and [RFC5881]) usually requires BFD sessions be explicitly configured
   or registered on both sides.  This requirement is not an issue when
   an application like BGP [RFC4271] has the concept of a "session" that
   involves both sides for its establishment.  However, this requirement
   can be operationally challenging when the prerequisite "session" does
   not naturally exist between two endpoints in an application.
   Simultaneous configuration and coordination may be required on both
   sides for BFD to take effect.  For example:

   o  When BFD is used to keep track of the "liveness" of the nexthop of
      static routes.  Although only one side may need the BFD
      functionality, currently both sides need to be involved in

Internet-DraftUnsolicited BFD for Sessionless Applications  October 2021


      specific configuration and coordination and in some cases static
      routes are created unnecessarily just for BFD.
   o  When BFD is used to keep track of the "liveness" of the third-pary
      nexthop of BGP routes received from the Route Server [RFC7947] at
      an Internet Exchange Point (IXP).  As the third-party nexthop is
      different from the peering address of the Route Server, for BFD to
      work, currently two routers peering with the Route Server need to
      have routes and nexthops from each other (although indirectly via
      the Router Server), and the nexthop of each router must be present
      at the same time.  These issues are also discussed in
      [I-D.ietf-idr-rs-bfd].

   Clearly it is beneficial and desirable to reduce or eliminate
   unnecessary configurations and coordination in these "sessionless"
   applications using BFD.

   In this document we present procedures for "unsolicited BFD" that
   allow a BFD session to be initiated by only one side, and be
   established without explicit per-session configuration or
   registration by the other side (subject to certain per-interface or
   per-router policies).

   With "unsolicited BFD" there is potential risk for excessive resource
   usage by BFD from "unexpected" remote systems.  To mitigate such
   risks, several mechanisms are recommended in the Security
   Considerations section.

   Compared to the "Seamless BFD" [RFC7880], this proposal involves only
   minor procedural enhancements to the widely deployed BFD itself.
   Thus we believe that this proposal is inherently simpler in the
   protocol itself and deployment.  As an example, it does not require
   the exchange of BFD discriminators over an out-of-band channel before
   the BFD session bring-up.

   When BGP Add-Path [RFC7911] is deployed at an IXP using the Route
   Server, multiple BGP paths (when exist) can be made available to the
   clients of the Router Server as described in [RFC7947].  The
   "unsolicited BFD" can be used in BGP route selection by these clients
   to eliminate paths with "inaccessible nexthops".

2.  Procedures for Unsolicited BFD

   With "unsolicited BFD", one side takes the "Active role" and the
   other side takes only the "Passive role" as described in [RFC5880].

   On the passive side, the "unsolicited BFD" SHOULD be explicitly
   configured on an interface or globally (apply to all interfaces).
   The BFD parameters can be either per-interface or per-router based.



Chen, et al.             Expires April 22, 2022                 [Page 3]

Internet-DraftUnsolicited BFD for Sessionless Applications  October 2021


   It MAY also choose to use the parameters that the active side uses in
   its BFD Control packets.  The "My Discriminator", however, MUST be
   chosen to allow multiple unsolicited BFD sessions.

   The active side starts sending the BFD Control packets as specified
   in [RFC5880].  The passive side does not send BFD Control packets.

   When the passive side receives a BFD Control packet from the active
   side with 0 as "Your Discriminator" and does not find an existing BFD
   session, the passive side MAY create a matching BFD session toward
   the active side, if permitted by local configuration.

   It would then start sending the BFD Control packets and perform
   necessary procedure for bringing up, maintaining and tearing down the
   BFD session.  If the BFD session fails to get established within
   certain specified time, or if an established BFD session goes down,
   the passive side would stop sending BFD Control packets and MAY
   delete the BFD session created until the BFD Control packets is
   initiated by the active side again.

   When an Unsolicited BFD session goes down, an implementation MAY
   retain the session state for a period of time, which may be
   configurable.  Retaining this state can be useful for operational
   purposes.

   The "Passive role" may change to the "Active role" when a local
   client registers for the same BFD session, and from the "Active role"
   to the "Passive role" when there is no longer any locally registered
   client for the BFD session.

3.  State Variables

   This document defines a new state variable called Unsolicited Role.

   bfd.UnsolicitedRole

   The operational mode of BFD interface when configured for unsolicited
   behaviour.  Options can be either PASSIVE, ACTIVE or NULL (NULL - not
   initialized) for unsolicited BFD sessions.  Default (not configured
   for unsolicited behaviour) MUST be set to NULL if present on the
   interface.

4.  YANG Data Model

   This section extends the YANG data model for BFD [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang]
   to cover the unsolicited BFD.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This documents makes no IANA requests.

6.  Acknowledgments

   Authors would like to thank Acee Lindem, Greg Mirsky, Jeffrey Haas
   and Raj Chetan for their review and valuable input.

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  BFD Protocol Security Considerations

   The same security considerations and protection measures as those
   described in [RFC5880] and [RFC5881] normatively apply to this
   document.  With "unsolicited BFD" there is potential risk for
   excessive resource usage by BFD from "unexpected" remote systems.  To
   mitigate such risks, the following measures are mandatory:

   o  Limit the feature to specific interfaces, and to a single-hop BFD
      with "TTL=255" [RFC5082].  For numbered interfaces source address
      of an incoming BFD packet should belongs to the subnet of the
      interface from which the BFD packet is received.  For unnumbered
      interfaces the above check should be aligned with routing protocol
      addresses running on such pair of interfaces.
   o  Apply "access control" to allow BFD packets only from certain
      subnets or hosts.
   o  Deploy the feature only in certain "trustworthy" environment,
      e.g., at an IXP, or between a provider and its customers.
   o  Adjust BFD parameters as needed for the particular deployment and
      scale.
   o  Use BFD authentication.

7.2.  YANG Module Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /routing/control-plane-protocols/control-plane-protocol/bfd/ip-sh
   /unsolicited:

   o  data node "enable" enables creation of unsolicited BFD IP single-
      hop sessions globally, i.e. on all interfaces.  See Section 7.1.
   o  data nodes local-multiplier, desired-min-tx-interval, required-
      min-rx-interval and min-interval all impact the parameters of the
      unsolicited BFD IP single-hop sessions.

   /routing/control-plane-protocols/control-plane-protocol/bfd/ip-sh
   /interfaces/interface/unsolicited:

   o  data node "enable" enables creation of unsolicited BFD IP single-
      hop sessions on a specific interface.  See Section 7.1.
   o  data nodes local-multiplier, desired-min-tx-interval, required-
      min-rx-interval and min-interval all impact the parameters of the
      unsolicited BFD IP single-hop sessions on the interface.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /routing/control-plane-protocols/control-plane-protocol/bfd/ip-sh
   /sessions/session/unsolicited: access to this information discloses
   the role of the local system in the creation of the unsolicited BFD
   session.
