Abstract

   The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for
   the discovery and selection of network services.  Using this
   protocol, computers using the Internet need little or no static
   configuration of network services for network based applications.
   This is especially important as computers become more portable, and
   users less tolerant or able to fulfill the demands of network system
   administration.

1. Introduction

   Traditionally, users find services by using the name of a network
   host (a human readable text string) which is an alias for a network
   address.  The Service Location Protocol eliminates the need for
   a user to know the name of a network host supporting a service.
   Rather, the user names the service and supplies a set of attributes
   which describe the service.  The Service Location Protocol allows the
   user to bind this description to the network address of the service.

   Service Location provides a dynamic configuration mechanism for
   applications in local area networks.  It has been designed to serve
   enterprise networks with shared services, and may not in its current
   form scale for wide-area service discovery throughout the global
   Internet.  Applications are modeled as clients that need to find
   servers attached to the enterprise network at a possibly distant
   location.  For cases where there are many different clients and/or
   services available, the protocol is adapted to make use of nearby
   Directory Agents that offer a centralized repository for advertised
   services.


2. Terminology

      User Agent (UA)
                A process working on the user's behalf to establish



Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998          [Page 1]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


                contact with a useful service.  The UA retrieves service
                information from the Service Agents or Directory Agents.

      Service Agent (SA)
                A process working on the behalf of one or more services
                to advertise service information.

      Service Information
                A collection of attributes and configuration information
                associated with a single service.  The SAs advertise
                service information for a collection of service
                instances.

      Directory Agent (DA)
                A process which collects information from SAs to provide
                a single repository of service information in order to
                centralize it for efficient access by UAs.  There can
                only be one DA present per given host.

      Service Type
                Each type of service has a unique Service Type string.
                The Service Type defines a template, called a "service
                scheme", including expected attributes, values and
                protocol behavior.

      IANA      IANA stands for the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.

      Naming Authority
                The agency or group which catalogues given Service Types
                and Attributes.  The default Naming Authority is IANA.

      Keyword
                A string describing a characteristic of a service.

      Attribute
                A (class, value-list) pair of strings describing a
                characteristic of a service.  The value string may be
                interpreted as a boolean, integer or opaque value if it
                takes specific forms (see section 20.4).

      Predicate
                A boolean expression of attributes, relations and
                logical operators.  The predicate is used to find
                services which satisfy particular requirements.  See
                section 6.3.

      Alphanumeric
                A character within the range 'a' to 'z', 'A' to 'Z', or
                '0' to '9'.

      Scope     A collection or set of services that make up a logical
                group.  See sections D and 17.

      Site Network
                All the hosts accessible within the Agent's multicast
                radius, which defaults to a value appropriate for
                reaching all hosts within a site (see section 22).  If
                the site does not support multicast, the agent's site
                network is restricted to a single subnet.

      URL       A Universal Resource Locator - see [4].

      Address Specification
                This is the network layer protocol dependent mechanism
                for specifying an Agent.  This is part of a URL.

      SLPv1     The version of Service Location Protocol specified in
                RFC 2165 [17].


2.1. Notation Conventions

               The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
               "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
               "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
               interpreted as described in RFC 2119  [6].

      Quoted Strings
               Some strings are quoted in this document to indicate
               they should be used literally.  Single characters inside
               apostrophes are included literally.

      <>       Values set off in this manner are fully described in
               section 20.  In general, all definitions of items in
               messages are described in section 20 or immediately
               following their first use.

      silently discard
               The implementation discards the datagram without further
               processing, and without indicating an error to the
               sender.  The implementation SHOULD provide the capability
               of logging the error, including the contents of the
               discarded datagram, and SHOULD record the event in a
               statistics counter.

   A is a 2 byte field.  B is of *arbitrary length*, where the length
   in bytes is typically indicated by A. C is of arbitrary length.  A
   string field in a SLP message is 'omitted' by setting the length of
   the string to 0 and transmitting no character bytes.

   Syntax for string based protocols will follow the conventions defined
   for ABNF [8].  Terms in angular brackets are defined formally in
   Section 20 or where they are introduced.


2.2. Service Information and Predicate Representation

   Service information is represented in a text format.  The goal is
   that the format be human readable and transmissible via email.  The
   location of network services is encoded as a Universal Resource
   Locator (URL) which is human readable.  Strings used in the Service
   Location Protocol are NOT null-terminated.


3. Protocol Overview

   The basic operation in Service Location is that a client attempts to
   discover the location of a Service.

   A client uses a User Agent (UA) to obtain service information.  A
   service uses a Service Agent (SA) to advertise service information.
   These Agents may be implemented various ways.  For instance, they
   could be a shared user library or be a system service accessible to
   user level applications.

   In smaller installations, UAs will request information directly from
   SAs.  In larger installations, SAs will register their services with
   one or more Directory Agents (DAs), and UAs will contact the DA to
   fulfill requests for Service Location information.  UAs and SAs
   discover DAs by preconfiguration, DHCP [9, 1], or using SLP itself.
   A scoping facility is used to provide further protocol scalability.

   UAs require no preconfiguration to begin network interaction.  The
   UA's primary function is to issue Service Requests and obtain the
   URLs of services.  This request specifies the requirements of the
   client application, and is all that is required to discover services
   using SLP.

   The UA MAY also discover all available types of service and
   attributes of services, but this is not required for lightweight
   UA implementations.  These additional requests enable the client
   application to perform interactive service discovery.

   UAs may obtain service information directly from SAs by multicasting
   the request and gathering the replies.  The same request may be
   unicast to a DA, so it is transparent to the client application
   whether there are DAs or not.

   DAs are used in larger deployments.  If DHCP or static configuration
   is used to configure the UA, and DAs are deployed, the UA will not
   have to make any multicast requests at all.  All requests will be
   unicast from the UA to the DA (see section  6.2).  Otherwise, the
   UA will multicast a DA discovery request to find DAs and issue all
   unicast all subsequent requests to one or more of these DAs.

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   When the UA issues a multicast request to SAs it makes use of a
   retransmission/convergence algorithm in order to accumulate available
   information reliably from multiple sources.  The UA resends the
   request periodically, for a short interval.  See section 21 for the
   details of this algorithm.

   SAs SHOULD listen for multicast requests using the Service
   Location General Multicast Address.  A SA which does not respond
   to multicast requests will not be useful in the absence of DAs.
   SA implementations may omit this functionality if an especially
   lightweight implementation is required.

   SAs MUST listen for DAAdverts passively.  UAs SHOULD do this, but are
   not required to do so.  Instead they may use a lazy approach and only
   do DA discovery actively (periodically) when they do not know of any
   DAs which respond to their requests.

   SAs MUST register their service advertisements with DAs, subject to
   the rules described in 17.1.

   Service advertisements have a lifetime.  DAs act as caches for
   this information, which eventually ages out.  SAs must refresh
   registrations before they age out if the service advertisement is to
   remain available continuously.


3.2. Introduction to Directory Agents

   A DA acts on behalf of many SAs.  It acquires information from them
   and acts as a soft state cache.  It is a single point of contact to
   supply that information to UAs.

   The queries that a UA multicasts to SAs (in an environment without a
   DA) are the same as queries that the UA might unicast to a DA. A UA
   may cache information about the presence of alternate DAs to use in
   case a selected DA fails.

   Aside from enhancing the scalability of the protocol (see section D),
   running multiple DAs provides robustness of operation.  The DAs may
   have replicated service information which remain accessible even when
   one of the DAs fail.  DAs, in the future, may use mechanisms outside
   of this protocol to coordinate the maintenance of a distributed
   database of Service Location information, and thus scale to larger
   administrative domains.

   Each SA MUST register with all DAs they are configured to use.
   UAs may choose among DAs they are configured to use.  UAs and
   SAs determine which DAs to use based on scope rules described in
   Section 17.1.



Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998          [Page 6]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   Locally, DA consistency is guaranteed using mechanisms in the
   protocol.  There isn't any DA to DA protocol yet.  Rather, passive
   detection of DAs by SAs ensures that eventually service information
   will be registered consistently between equivalent DAs.  Invalid
   data will age out of the DA caches leaving only transient stale
   registrations even in the case of a failure of a SA.


3.3. URLs used in the Service Location Protocol

   The Service Location Protocol uses URLs to indicate the location of
   services.  URLs are used in a variety of Service Location Messages:
   SAs send them to register and deregister service advertisements,
   UAs obtain them in Service Replies and may send them in Attribute
   Requests.  Any URL which conforms to standard URL syntax conventions
   (see RFC 1738 [4]) may be used in these messages.

   Service:  URLs are useful for transmitting a service's location to a
   client application.  Other standard URL schemes may also be used for
   this purpose.


3.3.1. The ``service:''  URL scheme

   The service URL scheme is used specifically to communicate a Service
   Location.  Many Service Types will be named by including a standard
   network service name after the ``service:''  scheme name.

   The format of the information which follows the ``service:''  scheme
   should as closely as possible follow the URL structure and semantics
   as formalized by the IETF standardization process.  See [10].

   Well known Service Types are registered with the IANA and templates
   are available as RFCs.  Private Service Types may also be supported.


3.4. Standard Attribute Definitions

   Service Types used with the Service Location Protocol must describe
   the following:

         Service Type string of the service
         Attributes and Keywords
         Attribute Descriptions and interpretations

   Service Types not specified by documents maintained with IANA
   will use their own Naming Authority string.  The procedure for
   standardizing new Service Types is defined in [10].




Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998          [Page 7]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   Services which advertise a particular Service Type must support the
   complete set of standardized attributes.  They may support additional
   attributes, beyond the standardized set.  Unrecognized attributes
   MUST be ignored by UAs.

   Service Type names which begin with "x-" are guaranteed not to
   conflict with any officially registered Service Type names.  It
   is suggested that this prefix be used for experimental or private
   Service Type names.  Similarly, attribute names which begin with "x-"
   are guaranteed not to be used for any officially registered attribute
   names.

   A service of a given Service Type should accept the networking
   protocol if one is implied in its definition.  If a Service Type
   can accept multiple protocols, configuration information SHOULD
   be included in the Service Type attribute information.  This
   configuration information will enable an application to use the
   results of a Service Request and Attribute Request to directly
   connect to a service.  The format of a Service Type string is
   described in section 20.1.1.


3.5. Naming Authority

   The Naming Authority of a service defines the meaning of the
   Service Types and attributes registered with and provided by Service
   Location.  The Naming Authority itself is a string which uniquely
   identifies an organization.  If no string is provided IANA is the
   default.

   Naming Authorities may define Service Types which are experimental,
   proprietary or for private use.  The procedure to use is to create
   a 'unique' Naming Authority string and then specify the Standard
   Attribute Definitions as described above.  This Naming Authority
   will accompany registration and queries, as described in sections 6
   and 13.

   Service Types SHOULD be registered with IANA to allow for
   Internet-wide interoperability.


3.6. Interpretation of Service Location Replies

   Replies should be considered to be valid at the time of delivery.
   The service may, however, fail or change between the time of the
   reply and the moment an application seeks to make use of the service.
   The application making use of Service Location MUST be prepared for
   the possibility that the service information provided is either stale
   or incomplete.  In the case where the service information provided



Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998          [Page 8]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   does not allow a UA to connect to a service as desired, the Service
   Request and/or Attribute Request may be resubmitted.

   Service specific configuration information (such as which protocol
   to use) should be included as attribute information in Service
   Registrations.


3.7. Transmission of SLP messages

3.7.1. Use of TCP

   The Service Location Protocol requires the implementation of UDP
   (connectionless) and TCP (connection oriented) transport protocols.
   The latter is used for bulk transfer only when necessary.  The only
   two reasons to use TCP are:

   First, a registration or deregistration may be too large to fit into
   a datagram.  If no MTU information is available for the route, assume
   that the MTU is 1400 which is enough to accommodate a IPv6 header and
   UDP header in an ethernet frame.  This value is configurable (see
   section 22).  In this case a connection must be set up from a SA to a
   DA. UAs may establish a TCP connection with a DA (not an SA) to send
   requests which do not fit in a datagram to DAs.

   Second, if the reply to a UA's request overflows a datagram, the
   DA or SA truncates the reply to fit in one datagram and sets the
   'overflow' bit in the SLP header.  A UA which receives such a reply
   MAY open a TCP connection with the DA or SA and retransmit the
   request.  It MAY also attempt to make use of the truncated reply or
   reformulate a more restrictive request which will result in a smaller
   reply.

   DAs and SAs MUST respond to connection requests; SAs whose
   registration data can overflow a datagram must be able to use TCP to
   send the registration.

   A TCP connection initiated by an Agent may be used for a single
   transaction.  It may also be used for multiple transactions.  Since
   there are length fields in the message headers, the Agents may send
   multiple requests along a connection and read the return stream for
   acknowledgments and replies.

   The initiating agent is responsible for closing the TCP connection.
   The DA should wait at least CONFIG_CLOSE_CONN seconds before closing
   an idle connection.  DAs and SAs SHOULD eventually close idle
   connections to ensure robust operation, even when the agent which
   opened a connection neglects to close it.




Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998          [Page 9]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   SAs and UAs use ephemeral ports for transmitting information to the
   service location port, which is 427.


3.7.2. Use of Multicast Addresses

   SrvTypeRqst messages are sent to the Service Location General
   Multicast Address.  SrvRqst messages used for DA Discovery are sent
   to the Directory Agent Discovery Multicast Address.

   SAs must join multicast groups depending on which services they
   advertise (called Service-Specific multicast addresses).  They also
   must join the Service Location General Multicast Address.

   UAs send multicast SrvRqst or AttrRqst messages to the Service-
   Specific multicast group corresponding to the service type of the
   request.

   Service-Specific Multicast addresses are computed by calculating a
   string hash on the service type string.  The service type string is
   defined in Section 20.1.1.  This string will always fall inside the
   ASCII range of the UTF8 [19] encoding due to its definition.

   The multicast group they join is determined by the string hash
   function given below:

#define RANGE_SIZE 0x7f
/*
 *  SLPhash returns a hash value in the range 0-RANGE_SIZE for
 *  a string of single-byte characters, of specified length.
 */
unsigned long SLPhash (const char *pc, unsigned int length) {
    unsigned long h = 0;
    while (length-- != 0) {
        h *= 33;
        h += *pc++;
    }
    return (RANGE_SIZE & h);  /* round to fit in range of addresses */
}

   This value is added to the base range of Service Specific Discovery
   Addresses, to be assigned by IANA. These will be 128 contiguous
   multicast addresses from the administrative local multicast range.


3.7.3. Multicast vs.  Broadcast

   The Service Location Protocol was designed for use in networks
   where DHCP is available, or multicast is supported at the network



Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 10]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   layer.  To support this protocol when only network layer broadcast is
   supported, the following procedures may be followed.


3.7.3.1. Single Subnet

   In isolated networks, broadcasts will work in place of multicast.

   SAs SHOULD and DAs MUST listen for broadcast Service Location request
   messages to the Service Location port.  This allows UAs which lack
   multicast capabilities to still make use of Service Location on a
   single subnet.


3.7.3.2. Multiple Subnets

   In larger enterprises, a DA can be used to provide a central clearing
   house of information for UAs.  The DA address can be dynamically
   configured with Agents using DHCP. The address can also be determined
   by static configuration.  Using multicast DA discovery in enterprises
   with multiple subnets will require use of multicast discovery with
   multiple hops (i.e., TTL > 1 in the IP header).  Note that the
   setting of the TTL in multicast packets sometimes must be interpreted
   according to conventional scoping agreements rather than strictly as
   the number of hops.


4. Service Location General Message Format

   The following header is used in all of the message descriptions below
   and is abbreviated by using "Service Location header =" followed by
   the function being used.

      Length   The number of bytes in the message, including the Service
               Location Header.

      O        The 'Overflow' bit.  See Section 3.7 for the use of this
               field.

      M        The 'Monolingual' bit.  Requests with this bit set
               indicate the User Agent will only accept responses in
               the language (see section 18) that is indicated by the
               Service or Attribute Request.

      U        The 'URL Authentication Present' bit.  See sections 4.3,
               4.4, 13, and 15 for the use of this field.

      A        The 'Attribute Authentication Present' bit.  See
               sections 4.3, 4.4, and 11 for the use of this field.

      F        If the 'Fresh bit' is set by the SA when it makes
               a Service Registration if it is to be considered
               'fresh'.  If this bit is not present, the registration is
               considered to be an update.

      R        The 'Multicast request' bit.  This is set by the UA when
               it multicasts a request.

      S        The 'Specific Scoping' bit.  This is set by Service
               Location Protocol entities wishing to exclude services
               not assigned to any scope, or by services unwilling
               to provide service to user agents not specifying the
               particular scope.

      reserved MUST be zero.

      Transaction Identifier (XID)
               The XID (transaction ID) field allows the requester to
               match replies to individual requests (see section 4.2).

      Next Option Offset
               Options are added after the regular payload in the SLP
               packet.  If no options are present, then this field is
               set to 0.

      Language Tag Length
               Strings within the remainder of the message which follows
               are to be interpreted in the language specified (see
               section 18) in the bytes following the header.  The
               Language Tag is defined by RFC 1766 [2].

   Note that, whenever there is an Attribute Authentication block, there
   will also be a URL Authentication block.  Thus, it is an error to
   have the 'A' bit set without also having the 'U' bit set.


4.1. Service Location Extension Options

   A service location extension option must be specified by a standards
   track document.  The option may be defined to accompany any or
   all Service Location Messages.  A conforming SLP implementation
   MUST be able to ignore Service Location Extension Options it does
   not recognize.  It may be the case that future Options will be
   defined and standardized which will become requirements of SLP
   implementations.  These documents will have to proceed as Standards
   Track specifications.  Otherwise, support of all headers is elective.

   The format of a Service Location Extension Option is:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |      Option Extension ID      |     Offset to next Option     |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     \                       Extension Contents                      \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Option Extension ID is defined by a Standards document which also
   defines the contents of the extension.  The offset to next option
   is 0 if there is no option following or is set to the length of the
   Extension contents.

4.2. Retransmission and Transaction IDs (XIDs)

   Retransmission is used by UAs and SAs to ensure reliable exchange of
   unicast messages with DAs.  If a UA or SA sends a message to a DA
   fails to receive a response, the message will be sent again.  The
   message is retried up to 3 times

   Multicast requests are retransmitted, but according to different
   rules.  See Section 21 for the details of the algorithm.

   Replies received using the multicast convergence algorithm are
   accumulated until convergence has been detected.

   A list of previous responders is sent.  This list will prevent those
   in the list from responding, to be sure that responses from other
   sources are not drowned out.

   Retransmission of the same message should not contain an updated XID.
   It is quite possible the original request reached the DA or SA, but
   reply failed to reach the requester.  Using the same XID allows the
   DA or SA to cache its reply to the original request and then send it
   again, should a duplicate request arrive.  This cached information
   should only be held very briefly (CONFIG_KEEP_RPLY is recommended.)
   Any registration or deregistration at a DA, or change of service
   information at a SA should flush this cache so that the information
   returned to the client is always valid.

   The requester creates the XID from an initial random seed and
   increments it by one for each request it makes.  The XIDs will
   eventually wrap and continue incrementing from there.  Requests are
   never sent with an XID of 0.

   An unsolicited DAAdvert has an XID of 0.

   Requests all include XIDs which will match the XIDs of the replies.
   The replies may be returned in any order.  A UA or SA may have
   multiple outstanding requests.


4.3. URL Entries

   When URLs are registered, they have lifetimes and lengths, and may
   be authenticated.  These values are associated with the URL for

   the duration of the registration.  The association is known as a
   "URL-entry", and has the following format:

                 (if present) A timestamped authentication block
                 (section 4.4)

   If the 'U' bit is set in the message header, the URL is followed by
   an URL Authentication Block.  If the scheme used in the URL does not
   have a standardized representation, the minimal requirement is:

      service:<srvtype>://<addr-spec>

   "service" is the URL scheme used for denoting a service access point,
   (see [10] for the formal definition.)  Other URLs besides service:
   scheme URLs may be transmitted in Service Location Messages.


4.4. Authentication Blocks

   Authentication blocks are used to authenticate service registrations
   and deregistrations.  URLs are registered along with an URL
   Authentication block to retain the authentication information in
   the URL entry for subsequent use by UAs who receive a Service Reply
   containing the URL entry.  Service attributes are registered along

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   with an Attribute Authentication block.  Both authentication blocks
   have the format illustrated below.

   If a service registration is accompanied by authentication which can
   be validated by the DA, the DA MUST validate any subsequent service
   deregistrations, so that unauthorized entities cannot invalidate
   such registered services.  Likewise, if a service registration
   is accompanied by an Attribute Authentication block which can be
   validated by the DA, the DA MUST validate any subsequent attribute
   registrations, so that unauthorized entities cannot invalidate such
   registered attributes.

   To avoid replay attacks which use previously validated
   deregistrations, the deregistration or attribute registration
   message must contain a timestamp for use by the DA. To avoid replay
   attacks which use previously validated registrations to nullify a
   valid deregistration, registrations must also contain a timestamp.

   A single Authentication Block is returned with an AttrRply and
   SrvRply.  A SrvReg may include multiple authentication blocks if
   more the service is to be registered in more than one protected
   scope, or if more than one cryptographic algorithm is supported by
   the Service Location Protocol deployment.  A DAAdvert will include
   one Authentication Block per protected scope that the DA supports.
   Unsolicited DAAdverts (see Section 12) will always be made in using
   the default cryptographic algorithm (see below).  DAAdverts sent as a
   reply to a SrvRqst will include only one Authenticator Block.

   An authentication block has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3

               Block.  The only value currently defined is 1, for
               Object-Identifier.

      Length   The length of the Authentication Block

      Structured Authentication Block
               An algorithm specification, and the authentication data
               produced by the algorithm.

   The Structured Authentication Block contains a digital signature
   of the information being authenticated.  It contains sufficient
   information to determine the algorithm to be used and the keys to be
   selected to verify the digital signature.

   The digital signature is computed over the following ordered stream
   of data:

       LIFETIME                 (2 bytes in network byte order)
       LENGTH OF URL            (2 bytes in network byte order)
       URL                      (n bytes)
       TIMESTAMP                (8 bytes in SNTP format [14])
       LENGTH OF SCOPE STRING   (2 bytes)
       SCOPE STRING             (n bytes)


   When producing a URL Authentication block, the authentication
   data produced by the algorithm identified within the Structured
   Authentication Block calculated over the following ordered stream of
   data:

       LENGTH OF ATTRIBUTES     (2 bytes in network byte order)
       ATTRIBUTES               (n bytes)
       TIMESTAMP                (8 bytes in SNTP format [14])
       LENGTH OF SCOPE STRING   (2 bytes)
       SCOPE STRING             (n bytes)


   Every Service Location Protocol entity (UA, SA, or DA) which
   is configured for use with protected scopes MUST implement
   "md5WithRSAEncryption" [3] and be able to associate it with BSD value
   == 1.  A conforming SLP implementation MAY implement other digital
   signature systems.

   In the case where BSD == 1 and OID == "md5WithRSAEncryption" is
   selected, the Structured Authentication Block will start with the
   ASN.1 Distinguished Encoding (DER) [7] for "md5WithRSAEncryption",
   which has the as its value the bytes (MSB first in hex):

        "30 0d 06 09 2a 86 48 86 f7 0d 01 01 04 05 00"

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   This is then immediately followed by an ASN.1 Distinguished Encoding
   (as a "Bitstring") of the RSA encryption (using the Scope's private
   key) of a bitstring consisting of the OID for "MD5" concatenated by
   the MD5 [16] message digest computed over the fields above.  The
   exact construction of the MD5 OID and digest can be found in RFC
   1423 [3].


4.5. URL Entry Lifetime

   The Lifetime field is set to the number of seconds the reply can be
   cached by any agent.  A value of 0 means the information must not be
   cached.  UAs MAY cache service information, but if they do, they must
   provide a way for applications to flush this cached information and
   issue the request directly onto the network.

   Services should be registered with DAs with a Lifetime, the suggested
   value being CONFIG_LIFETIME. The service must be reregistered before
   this interval elapses, or the service advertisement will no longer
   be available.  Thus, services which vanish and fail to deregister
   eventually become automatically deregistered.


5. Service Location Protocol Requests

   SLP includes SrvRqst, AttrRqst and SrvTypeRqst messages.  All UAs
   MUST be able to issue SrvRqst messages and SHOULD be able to issue
   AttrRqst and SrvTypeRqst messages.  SAs issue only SrvRqst messages,
   and only for the purpose of DA discovery.

   UAs MUST use scoped DAs in preference to unscoped DAs and any DA
   in preference to multicasting to SAs.  See section 17.1 for rules
   concerning the use of scopes.

   Multicast and broadcast requests MUST set the 'R' bit in the header.
   This will ease implementation of combined DA and SA services by
   making it apparent whether an arriving datagram was unicast or
   multicast.  Multicast (or broadcast) service requests MUST be ignored
   by DAs.

   Replies to SLP requests include a 2 byte error code.  If the error
   code is nonzero the rest of the message SHOULD be omitted.  The error
   codes which may be returned are:

      0        Success

      LANGUAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED
               A SA or DA returns this when a request is received
               from a UA which is in a language for which there is no



Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 19]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


               registered Service Information which can satisfy it, or
               the request arrived with the Monolingual bit set and no
               registration is available in the specified language.  See
               Section 18.  Note:  SrvTypeRqst messages do not contain a
               Language Tag, so they never elicit this error.

      PROTOCOL_PARSE_ERROR
               A SA or DA returns this error when a SrvRply is received
               which cannot be parsed or the declared string lengths
               overrun the message.

      SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED
               A DA will return this error if it receives a request
               which has a scope not supported by the DA. An SA will
               not return this error; it will simply not reply to the
               multicast request.


6. Service Request Message Format

   The Service Request is used by UAs to obtain URLs from a DA or SAs.

   The format of the Service Request is as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Service Location header (function = SrvRqst)          |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |length of prev resp list string| Previous Responders Addr Spec \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    length of <scope-list>     |     <scope-list> String       \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  length of predicate string   |  Service Request <predicate>  \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The <Previous Responders Addr Spec> is described in sections 8
   and 20.1.

   See Section 17.1 for the interpretation of the scope-list field.

   The predicate allows the UA to request the Service Type and specific
   required attributes of a services in a specific language.  The
   minimal form of a Service Request is shown below:

      "(service-type=" <srvtype> ["."<na>] ")"





Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 20]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   Service Requests MAY include a scope term and a 'where clause'.  The
   syntax of the query language is described in section 6.4.  The form
   of a Service Request is:

      "(&(service-type=" <srvtype> ["."<na>] ")" <where> ")"


   where:

    -  The <srvtype> refers to the Service Type.  For each type
       of service available, there is a unique Service type name
       string.  This term MUST be part of every Service Request.  See
       section 20.1.1.

    -  The <na> is the Naming Authority.  This term is OPTIONAL. See
       section 20.1.1.

    -  The <where> string contains a set of query terms which will
       indicate those service instances which the User Agent is
       interested in.  This clause includes attributes, boolean
       operators and relations.  (See section 6.3.)

   In order for a request to succeed in matching registered information,
   the following conditions must be met:

    1. The result must have the same Service Type as the request.

    2. It must have the same Naming Authority.

    3. It must satisfy the scoping rules for requests (see
       Section 17.1).

    4. The conditions specified in the Where Clause must match the
       attributes and keywords registered with the service.


6.1. Service Request Usage

   The UA forms SrvRqsts using standard or conventionally known Service
   Type attributes.  It MAY also issue AttrRqsts to obtain the attribute
   values for a Service Type before issuing SrvRqsts (see Section 11).
   Having obtained the attributes which describe a particular kind
   of service from an AttrRqsts, or using configured knowledge of a
   service's attributes, the UA can build a predicate that describes the
   service needs of the user.

   Suppose a printer supporting the lpr protocol is needed on the 12th
   floor which has UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS and prints 12 pages per minute.
   Suppose further that a Attribute Request indicates that there is a



Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 21]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   printer on the 12th floor, a printer that prints 12 pages per minute,
   and a printer that offers UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS. To check whether they
   are same printer, issue the following request:

      (& (SERVICE-TYPE=LPR)(PAGES PER MINUTE=12)
         (UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS=*)
         (LOCATION=12th FLOOR))

   Suppose there is no such printer.  The DA responds with a SrvRply
   with 0 in the number of responses and no reply values.  A SA silently
   discards the request.

   The UA might then try a less restrictive query to find a printer,
   using only the 12th floor as "where" criteria.

      (&(SERVICE-TYPE=LPR)(LOCATION=12th FLOOR))

   In this case, there might be the reply:

      Returned URL:   service:lpr://igore.wco.ftp.com:515/draft

   The Address Specification for the printer is:  igore.wco.ftp.com:515,
   containing the name of the host managing the requested printer.
   Files would be printed by spooling to that port on that host.  The
   word 'draft' refers to the name of the print queue the lpr server
   supports.


6.2. Directory Agent Discovery Request

   Normally a SrvRqst returns a Service Reply.  The sole exception to
   this is a SrvRqst for the Service Type "directory-agent".  This
   SrvRqst is answered with a DAAdvert.

   UAs and SAs which lack preconfigured or DHCP configured knowledge of
   a DA MUST multicast a Service Request to the DA Discovery Multicast
   Address.  For the details of the multicast convergence algorithm see
   Section 21.  The predicate included in this request is:

         (service-type=directory-agent)

   The <scope-list> in the DA discovery request may include only the
   string "*" in their <scope-list>.  In this case, all DAs respond.

   If it includes any scope strings, only those DAs which support the
   indicated scope reply, or those which support unscoped requests.  A
   DA discovery request which has the 'S' bit set in the message header
   will not get responses from unscoped DAs.




Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 22]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   Normally, a DA will not respond to multicast requests, nor will
   it respond to requests which are improperly scoped.  This request
   is a special case, if a properly scoped DA Discovery request is
   received from the DA Discovery multicast group a DA MUST respond.  If
   the request specifies a scope, the DA MUST NOT respond unless the
   scope request matches its scope.  If a DA has no scope, it will only
   respond if there is no scope term or the request does not have the
   'S' bit set.

   DA Advertisement Replies may arrive from different sources, similar
   in form to:

      URL returned:   service:directory-agent://slp-resolver.big.org
      Scope returned: NONE (ie. the length field is set to 0 for the
                      scope string.)

      URL returned:   service:directory-agent://204.182.15.66
      Scope returned: JANITORIAL SERVICES,ADMIN

      URL returned:   service:directory-agent://204.182.15.66
      Scope returned: Legal Department  ('S' bit set)

   The first DA supports only unscoped advertisements.  The second
   supports advertisements which are unscoped, or are in the JANITORIAL
   SERVICES or ADMIN scope.  The DA in the last example supports
   only the LEGAL DEPARTMENT scope, and explicitly NOT unscoped
   advertisements.

   The DA Advertisement format is defined in Section 12.

   If the goal is merely to discover any DA, the first DA Advert which
   is received will do.  If the goal, however, is to discover all
   reachable DAs, the multicast convergence algorithm must be used, see
   Section 21.


6.3. Explanation of Terms of Predicate Grammar

   A predicate has a simple structure, which depends on parentheses,
   commas and slashes to delimit the elements.  Examples of proper usage
   are given throughout this document.

   The predicate uses the same syntax as a LDAP search filter [11].
   This means that a SLP service request could be handled by a LDAP
   server.  The reverse is not true:  SLP uses a greatly simplified
   attribute typing system.  Thus a SA or DA cannot interpret an
   arbitrary LDAP query.  There are some restrictions and assumptions
   which are necessary in order to interpret SrvRqst predicates in the
   context of SLP.



Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 23]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


    -  A query for keywords uses a 'present' filter type.  Thus, to
       query for services including the keyword 'X', the filter would be
       "X=*".

    -  Degenerate queries such as "(&" <filter> ")" and "(|" <filter>
       ")" must be tolerated.  They are equivalent to <filter>.

    -  LDAPv2 defines several data types [12].  The only data types
       which are supported in SLP are String (equivalent to a Case
       Ignore String), Opaque (equivalent to a Case Exact String, since
       the binary values is encoded as a radix64 value).  Integer and
       Boolean values are identically represented in SLP and LDAPv2.


6.4. Service Request Predicates

   The Service Request Predicate follows the grammar of the LDAPv2
   string search filter [11].

   The Predicate MUST contain a simple term which defines a service type
   for the query.  It MAY contain a simple term which defines the scope
   for the query (see section 17.1.)

   Restrictions which are not implied by the grammar are:

    -  LDAPv2 string text filters [11] and string based attribute
       encodings [12] are all ASCII based.  For UTF8 character encoding,
       which SLP supports, either the LDAPv3 filters (and UTF8) must
       be used or the <a> production in RFC 1778, Section 2, must be
       expanded to include the entire range of allowed alphanumerics
       excluding those in the <p> (protected) rule.

    -  <approx> filters, ``=~'', are interpreted as <equal> filters
       ``=''.  For strings the <approx> filter MAY be implemented
       so that it returns true for the service with the 'greatest
       possible' match of the string sequence.  For example:  (x=~ABCD)
       applied to services S1 with x=AAAA, S2 with x=ABBBBB and S3 with
       x=ABCCCC would return S3 since it matches the longest sequence of
       characters in the request.

    -  <starval> terms are always interpreted as string values and may
       only be used with <equal> filters, with the two exceptions

    -  <greater> filters applied to ``*'' as the value will return true
       only for the item whose value is the MAXIMUM for the attribute.
       This only applies to an Integer attribute.  Otherwise, it returns
       a PROTOCOL_PARSE_ERROR.





Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 24]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


    -  <less> filters applied to ``*'' as the value will return
       true only for the item(s) whose value is the MINIMUM for
       the attribute.  This only applies to an Integer attribute.
       Otherwise, it returns a PROTOTOL_PARSE_ERROR.

   The following are examples of query predicates in Service Requests.
   When the 'S' is present, it means that the 'S' bit is set in
   the message header.  See Section 17.1 for how details on how the
   <scope-list> works.

      "(service-type=http)" <scope-list>= none
                       This is a minimal request string.  It matches all
                       http services.

      "(service-type=lpr)" <scope-list>="SALES"
                       This request is for all lpr services either
                       universally available or available in the SALES
                       scope.

      "(service-type=lpr)" <scope-list>="SALES", 'S'
                       This request is for all lpr services which have
                       been explicitly configured to reside within in
                       the SALES scope.

      "(&(service-type=pop3)(user=wump))" <scope-list>="ADMIN"
                       This is a request for all pop3 services available
                       in the ADMIN scope (or are unscoped) and which
                       serve mail to the user 'wump'.

      "(&(service-type=backup)(qlength<=*))" <scope-list>="BLDG 32", 'S'

                       This returns the backup service which has
                       the shortest queue-length.  (This assumes that
                       the queue length is an integer based attribute).
                       It will return this only for services registered
                       with the BLDG 32 scope (not unscoped services.)


6.5. String Matching for Requests

   All strings are case insensitive, with respect to string matching
   on queries.  All preceding or trailing blanks which are not escaped
   should not be considered for a match.  White space (SPACE, CR, LF,
   TAB) internal to a string value is folded to a single SPACE character
   for the sake of string comparisons.


   For example, "  Some String  " matches "SOME    STRING".

   String comparisons (using comparison operators such as '<' or
   '>=') are done using lexical ordering in the character set of the
   registration, not using any language specific rules.  The ordering
   is strictly by the character value, i.e.  "0" < "A" is true when the
   character set is US-ASCII, since "0" has the value of 48 and "A" has
   the value 65.

   The special character '*' may precede, follow or be internal to a
   string value in order to indicate substring matching.  The query
   including this character matches any character sequence which
   conforms to the letters which are not wildcarded.

   Examples:

        "bob*" matches "bob", "bobcat", and "bob and sue"
        "*bob" matches "bob", "bigbob", and "sue and bob"
        "*bob*" matches "bob", "bobcat", "bigbob", and "a bob I know"
        "b*b" matches "bob" and "big dreams no grub"

   String matching is done after escape sequences have been substituted.
   See sections 18, 6.3, 19.


7. Service Reply Message Format

   The format of the Service Reply Message is:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     |                        <URL Entry 1>                          \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                        <URL Entry 2> ...                      \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     \                             . . .                             \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Each Service Reply message is composed of a list of URL Entries.

   Each <URL Entry> in the list has the form defined in Section 4.3.
   If the presence of an URL Authentication block is signaled by the
   'U' bit, the length of the authentication block is determined by
   information within the block as discussed in section 4.4.  The URL

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   Authentication block will include the authentication block calculated
   using the algorithm specified in the SrvRqst if possible.  If not,
   the Authentication block calculated using the default algorithm is
   supplied.

   A UA MAY use the authentication block to determine whether the SA
   advertising the URL is, in fact, authorized to offer the indicated
   service.

   If, in a list of URL entries, some of the URLs indicate services
   which are in protected scopes (see section 17.2) while other URLs in
   the list indicate services which are not in protected scopes, the
   latter must still have Authentication Blocks, but the length of the
   authentication block is shown as zero, and no authentication need be
   done.


8. Service Type Request Message Format

   The Service Type Request is used to determine all the types of
   services supported on a network.

   The format of a Service Type Request is:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |        Service Location header (function = SrvTypeRqst)       |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  length of prev resp string   |<Previous Responders Addr Spec>\
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |   length of naming authority  |   <Naming Authority String>   \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    length of <scope-list>     |     <scope-list> String       \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The <Previous Responders Addr Spec> is a comma delimited list.  See
   section 20.1.

   The Naming Authority, if included, will limit the replies to Service
   Type Requests to Service Types which have the specified Naming
   Authority.  If this field is omitted (i.e., the length field is
   zero), the default Naming Authority ("IANA") is assumed.  If the
   length field is -1, service types from all naming authorities are
   requested.

   See Section 17.1 for the interpretation of the scope-list field.

9. Service Type Reply Message Format

   The Service Type Reply has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     | length of Service Type String |     <Service Type String-1>   \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     \                             . . .                             \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     | length of Service Type String |     <Service Type String-N>   \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The service type's name is provided in the <Service Type String>.  If
   the service type has a naming authority other than "IANA" it MUST be
   returned following the service type string and a "." character.  See
   section 20.1.1 for the formal definition of this field.

   The following are examples of Service Type Strings which might be
   found in Service Type Replies:

         service:lpr:
         service:http:
         nfs:


10. Attribute Request Message Format

   The Attribute Request is used to obtain attribute information.  The
   UA supplies a request and the appropriate attribute information is
   returned.

   If the UA supplies only a Service Type, then the reply includes
   all attributes and all values for that Service Type.  The reply
   includes only those attributes for which services exist and are
   advertised by the DA or SA which received the Attribute Request.
   Since different instances of a given service can, and very likely
   will, have different values for the attributes defined by the Service
   Type, the UA must form a union of all attributes returned by all
   service Agents.  The Attribute information will be used to form
   Service Requests.

   If the UA supplies a URL, the reply will contain service information
   corresponding to that URL.



Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 28]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   Attribute Requests MAY include a 'select clause'.  This limits the
   amount of information returned.  If the select clause is empty,
   all information is returned.  Otherwise, the UA supplies a comma
   delimited list of attribute tags and keywords.  If the attribute
   or keyword is defined for a service, it will be returned in the
   Attribute Reply, along with all registered values for that attribute.
   If the attribute selected has not been registered for that URL or
   Service Type, the attribute or keyword information is simply not
   returned.

   The Attribute Request message has the following form:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Service Location header (function = AttrRqst)         |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |length of prev resp list string|<Previous Responders Addr Spec>\
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         length of URL         |              URL              \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    length of <scope-list>     |      <scope-list> string      \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |length of <Select-List> string |      <Select-List> string     \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The <Previous Responder Address List> functions exactly as introduced
   in Section 8.  See also Section 20.1.

   The URL field can take two forms:  Either it is simply a Service
   Type (see Section 20.1.1), such as "service:http:" or "nfs:".  All
   attributes and the full range of values for each attribute of all
   services of the given Service Type is returned.

   The URL field may also be a full URL, such as
   "service:lpr://igore.wco.ftp.com:515/draft" or "ftp://max.net/znoo".
   In this, only the attributes for the service of the specified URL is
   defined are returned.

   See Section 17.1 for the interpretation of the scope-list field.

   The select list takes the form of a <Select-List>, see  20.  The
   items on the list are attribute tags or keywords, which can be either
   complete tags or include '*' characters for wildcard string matching.

   An example of a select-list following the printer example is:

   "PAGES PER MINUTE,UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS,LOCATION"

11. Attribute Reply Message Format

   An Attribute Reply Message takes the form:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Service Location header (function = AttrRply)         |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Error Code            |  length of <attr-list> string \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     \                          <attr-list>                          \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     \            Attribute Authentication Block (if any)            \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The <attr-list> (attribute list) has the same form as the attribute
   list in a Service Registration, see Section 20.2 for a formal
   definition of this field.

   An Attribute Request for "lpr" might elicit the following reply
   (UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS is a keyword):

         (PAPER COLOR=WHITE,BLUE),
         (PAPER SIZE=LEGAL,LETTER,ENVELOPE,TRACTOR FEED),
         UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS,
         (PAGES PER MINUTE=1,3,12),
         (LOCATION=12th, NEAR ARUNA'S OFFICE),
         (QUEUES=LEGAL,LETTER,ENVELOPE,LETTER HEAD)

   If the message header has the 'A' bit set, the Attribute Reply will
   have an Attribute Authentication block set.  In this case, the
   Attribute Authentication Block must be returned with the entire list
   of attributes, exactly as it was registered by an SA in a protected
   scope.  In this case, the URL was registered in a protected scope
   and the UA included a URL but not a select clause.  If the AttrRqst
   specifies that only certain attributes are to be returned, the DA
   does not (typically cannot) compute a new Authentication so it simply
   returns the attributes without an authentication block.

   The SA or DA returns the Attribute Authentication block.  A UA
   which wishes to obtain authenticated attributes for a service in a
   protected scope MUST therefore must include a particular URL and no
   select list with the AttrRqst.

12. Directory Agent Advertisement Message Format

   DA Advertisement Messages have the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     \             autentication block N (continued) ...             \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Error Code is set when a DA Advertisement is returned as the
   result of a Service Request, as specified in Section 5.  The Error
   Code will always be set to 0 in the case of an unsolicited DA
   Advertisement.

   The DAAdvert Sequence Number is 0 when the DA comes up initially
   and increases by one each time the DAAdvert is sent unsolicited.
   DAs which store service advertisements in a nonvolatile store will
   set their initial sequence number to 256.  The sequence number will
   be used by SAs to determine if they must reregister services when
   a DA is discovered.  See section 16.1 which describes unsolicited
   DAAdverts and how SAs respond to them.

   The URL corresponds to the DA's location.

   There MUST be at least one authentication block for each protected
   scope.  There MAY be more than one authentication block for each
   protected scope if more than one authentication algorithm (identified
   by the BSD field) is used.

   See Section 17.1 for the definition of the <scope-list>.

   If the 'U' bit in the SLP header is set, an authentication block
   is included to allow the SA and UA to ascertain whether the DA

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   Advertisement is valid.  See 4.4.  See Section 6.4 for the lexical
   rules regarding <Scope>.

   DA Advertisements sent in reply to a Directory Agent Discovery
   Request has the same format as the unsolicited DA Advertisement, for
   example:

      URL:        service:directory-agent://SLP-RESOLVER.CATCH22.COM
      SCOPE List: ADMIN

   The DA can be reached at the Address Specification returned, and
   supports the SCOPE called "ADMIN".


13. Service Registration Message Format

   After a SA has found a DA, it begins to register its advertised
   services one at a time.  A SA must wait for some random time
   uniformly distributed within the range specified by CONFIG_REG_ACTIVE
   seconds before registering again.  Registration is done using the
   Service Registration message specifying all attributes for a service.
   If the service registration in a protected scope 17.2, then the
   service MUST include both a URL Authentication block and an Attribute
   Authentication block (see section 4.4).  In that case, the service
   agent MUST set both the 'U' bit and the 'A' bit (see section 4).

   A DA must acknowledge each service registration request.  If
   authentication blocks are included, the DA MUST verify the
   authentication before registering the service.  This requires
   obtaining key information, either by preconfiguration, maintenance
   of a security association with the service agent, or acquiring the
   appropriate certificate.

   The format of a Service Registration is:

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     \                          <URL-Entry>                          \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    Length of <scope-list>     |      <scope-list> String      \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |  Length of Attr List String   |          <attr-list>          \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     \        (if present) Attribute Authentication Block ...        \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The <URL-Entry> is defined at the end of Section 4.3.  The
   <attr-list> is defined in Section 20.2.  The Attribute Authentication
   Block, which is only present if the 'A' bit is set in the message
   header, is defined in section 4.4.

   The <scope-list> is defined in Section 17.1.

   Service registration may use a connectionless protocol (e.g.  UDP),
   or a connection oriented protocol (e.g.  TCP). If the registration
   operation may contain more information than can be sent in one
   datagram, the SA MUST use a connection oriented protocol to register
   itself with the DA.

   When a SA registers the same attribute class more than once for a
   service instance, the DA overwrites the all the values associated
   with that attribute class for that service instance.  Separate
   registrations must be made for each language that the service is to
   be advertised in.

   If a SA attempts to register a service with a DA and the registration
   is larger than the site path MTU, then the DA will reply with a
   SrvAck, with the error set to INVALID_REGISTRATION and the 'Overflow'
   byte set.

   An example of Service Registration information is:

      Lifetime (seconds):   16-bit unsigned integer
      URL (at least):       service:<srvtype>://<addr-spec>
      scope-list:           omitted (ie. no items, 0 bytes)
      Attributes (if any):  (ATTR1=VALUE),KEYWORD,(ATTR2 = VAL1, VAL2)

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   In order to offer continuously advertised services, SAs should start
   the reregistration process before the Lifetime they used in the
   registration expires.

   An example of a service registration (valid for 3 hours) is as
   follows:

      Lifetime:   10800
      URL:        service:lpr://igore.wco.ftp.com:515/draft
      scope-list: DEVELOPMENT
      Attributes: (PAPER COLOR=WHITE),
                  (PAPER SIZE=LETTER),
                  UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS,
                  (LANGUAGE=POSTSCRIPT, HPGCL),
                  (LOCATION=12 FLOOR)

   The same registration could be done again, as shown below, in German;
   however, note that "lpr" and "service" are reserved terms and will
   remain in the language they were originally registered (English).

      Lifetime:   10800
      URL:        service:lpr://igore.wco.ftp.com:515/draft

                  (DRUECKERSPRACHE=POSTSCRIPT,HPGCL),
                  (STANDORT=11 ETAGE)

   Scoped registrations must contain the SCOPE attribute.  Unscoped
   registrations must be registered with all unscoped DAs.

   Registrations of a previously registered service are considered
   an update.  If such an attribute registration is performed in a
   protected scope (see section 17.2), a new Attribute Authentication
   block must also be included, and the 'A' bit set in the registration
   message header.

   The new registration's attributes replace the previous
   registration's, but do not effect attributes which were
   included previously and are not present in the update.

   For example, suppose service:x://a.org has been registered
   with attributes A=1, B=2, C=3.  If a new registration comes for
   service:x://a.org with attributes C=30, D=40, then the attributes for
   the service after the update are A=1, B=2, C=30, D=40.

   In the example above, the SCOPE is set to DEVELOPMENT (in English)
   and ENTWICKLUNG (in German).  Recall that all strings in a message

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   must be in one language, which is specified in the header.  The
   string SCOPE is *not* translated, as it is one of the reserved
   strings in the Service Location Protocol (see section 19.1.)

   The DA may return a server error in the acknowledgment.  This error
   is carried in the Error Codes field of the service location message
   header.  The SrvReg may result in the error codes described in
   Section 14.

   There are various rules concerning scopes:  Which DAs a SA MUST
   register with and which DAs accept which registrations.  See
   Section 17.1.

   When the URL entry accompanying a registration also contains an
   authentication block (section 4.4), the DA MUST perform the indicated
   authentication, and subsequently indicate the results in the Service
   Acknowledgement message.


14. Service Acknowledgement Message Format

   A Service Acknowledgement is sent as the result of a DA receiving
   and processing a Service Registration or Service Deregistration.  An
   acknowledgment indicating success must have the error code set to
   zero.  Once a DA acknowledges a service registration it makes the
   information available to clients.

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     |          Error Code           |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Error Code may have one of the following values:

      0        Success

      PROTOCOL_PARSE_ERROR
               A DA returns this error when the SrvReg or SrvDeReg is
               received which cannot be parsed or the declared string
               lengths overrun the message.

      INVALID_REGISTRATION
               A DA returns this error when a SrvReg or SrvDeReg is
               invalid.  For instance, an invalid URL, unknown or
               malformed attributes, or deregistering an unregistered
               service all cause this error to be reported.

      SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED
               A DA which is configured to have a scope will return this
               error if it receives a SrvRqst which is set to have a
               scope which it does not support.

      AUTHENTICATION_ABSENT
               If DA has been configured to require an authentication
               for any service registered in the requested scope, and
               there are no authentication blocks in the registration,
               the DA will return this error.

      AUTHENTICATION_FAILED
               If the registration contains an authentication block
               which fails to match the correct result as calculated
               (see section 4.4) over the URL or attribute data to be
               authenticated, the DA will return this error.

   If the DA accepts a Service Registration, and already has an
   existing entry, it updates the existing entry with the new lifetime
   information and possibly new attributes and new attribute values.
   Otherwise, if the registration is acceptable (including all necessary
   authentication checks) the DA creates a new entry, and sets the 'F'
   bit in the Service Acknowledgement returned to the SA.


15. Service Deregister Message Format

   When a service is no longer available for use, the SA must deregister
   itself from DAs that it has been registered with.  A service uses the
   following PDU to deregister itself.

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |           Service Location header (function = SrvDeReg)       |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         length of URL         |              URL              \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     \             (if present) authentication block .....           \

     |  length of <tag spec> string  |            <tag spec>         \
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The SA should retry this operation if there is no response from the
   DA. The DA acknowledges this operation with a Service Acknowledgment
   message.  Once the Service Agent receives an acknowledgment
   indicating success, it can assume that the service is no longer
   advertised by the DA. The Error Code in the Acknowledgment of the

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   Service Deregistration may have the same values as described in
   section 14.

   The Service Deregister Information sent to the directory agent has
   the following form:

        service:<srvtype>://<addr-spec>
        Attribute tags (if any):  ATTR1,KEYWORD,ATTR2

   This will deregister the specified attributes from the service
   information from the directory agent.  If the Language Tag is omitted
   and no attribute tags are included, the entire service information is
   deregistered in every language and every scope it was registered in.
   To deregister the printer from the preceding example, use:

         service:lpr://igore.wco.ftp.com:515/draft

   If the service was originally registered with a URL entry containing
   a URL authentication block, then the Service Deregistration
   message header MUST have the 'U' bit set, and the URL entry is then
   followed by the authentication block, with the authentication block
   calculated over the URL data, the timestamp, and the length of the
   authentication as explained in section 4.4.  In this calculation, the
   lifetime of the URL data is considered to be zero, no matter what the
   current value for the remaining lifetime of the registered URL.


16. Directory Agents

16.1. Finding Directory Agents

   A UA or SA may be statically configured to use a particular DA. This
   is discouraged unless the application resides on a network where any
   form of multicast or broadcast is impossible.

   Alternatively, a host which uses DHCP [9, 1] may use it to obtain a
   DA's address.  DHCP options 78 and 79 have been assigned for this
   purpose [15].

   The third way to discover DAs is dynamically.  This is done by
   sending out a Directory Agent Discovery request (see Section 6.2).

   Lastly, the agent may be informed passively as follows:

   When a DA first comes on-line, and periodically, it sends an
   unsolicited DA Advertisement to the Service Location general
   multicast address.  See Section 21 for details.  If a DA supports a
   particular scope or set of scopes these are placed in its DAAdvert.




Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 37]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   When a SA or UA first comes on-line it must issue a Directory Agent
   Discovery Request unless it is using static or DHCP configuration, as
   described in 6.2.

   A SA registers information with ALL newly discovered DAs when either
   of the above two events take place.

   Once a UA becomes aware of a DA it will unicast its queries there.
   In the event that more than one DA is detected, it will select one to
   communicate with.

   The protocol will cause all DAs (of the same scope) to eventually
   obtain consistent information.  Thus one DA should be as good as any
   other for obtaining service information.  There may be temporary
   inconsistencies between DAs.


17. Scope Discovery and Use

   The scope mechanism in the Service Location Protocol enhances its
   scalability.  The primary use of scopes is to provide the capability
   to organize a site network along administrative lines.  A set of
   services can be assigned to a given department of an organization,
   to a certain building or geographical area or for a certain purpose.
   The users in a department can be configured to request services from
   a particular scope.  A scope is not an attribute of the service
   instance, because it is completely independent of the characteristics
   of the service instance.

   Services in a scope effectively offer their service only to users
   that indicate that particular scope in their user requests.  Just
   as sets can be non-disjoint, services can belong to several scopes.
   Users, on the other hand, are not viewed as belonging to particular
   scopes, but instead as having access to services in one or more
   scopes.  This access can be acquired in several ways, as further
   detailed below.

   Services that do not belong to any scope effectively offer their
   service to any user agent.  Since a user agent selects its desired
   service by specifying the desired attributes of that service, any
   service satisfying those attributes will satisfy the needs of the
   user agent.  Thus, a user agent typically does not care about which
   service agent provides the needed service.  Cases in which this is
   not true require the user agent to specify that only services from
   the specific scope are desired, but such cases always arise from
   administrative considerations, and not from the specific values
   assigned to service attributes.  The 'S' bit is supplied by user
   agents requiring the exclusion of services not assigned to the
   specific requested scope or scopes.



Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 38]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   A site network that has grown beyond a size that can be reasonably
   serviced by a few DAs can use the scope mechanism.  DAs may be
   configured with a scope list, representing the administrative
   categories which they serve.  The semantics and language of the
   strings used to describe the scope are almost entirely the choice of
   the administrative entity of the particular domain in which these
   scopes exist.  The values of SCOPE should be configurable, so the
   system administration Block can set its value.  The scopes "LOCAL"
   and "REMOTE" are reserved and SHOULD NOT be used.  Use of these
   reserved values is to be defined in a future protocol document.

   DAs advertise their available scopes, together with a
   "service:directory-agent:" URL indicating its location.
   These advertisements are sent periodically starting as soon as the
   DA first becomes available.  The UA and SA may also solicit these DA
   advertisements when they first come on line.  Thus, UAs and SAs are
   consistently informed of available scopes provided by scoped DAs.

   UAs may select or be configured with one or more scopes to use.  This
   selection may be automated through the use of DHCP or it may be done
   by the individual client application or service programmatically.
   UAs send all requests to DAs which support the scope or scopes they
   select.  A SA is configured with a scope (or scopes) in which to
   register.  It MUST register with all DAs in that scope that it can
   discover.  Failure to be comprehensive in registration according
   to this rule may mean that the service advertisement may not be
   available to all UAs.


17.1. Rules governing Scopes

   For the sake of illustration, imagine that a service is a candy M&M,
   and that scopes divide the candy up into sets all containing the same
   color.  Users want candy, but some users are more particular than
   others, and some users are constrained by their administration to
   only eat candy of a particular color.

   Rules for User Agents, for various combinations of settings of the
   'S' bit, and contents of the <scope-list>:

      <'S'=on, scope-list="">        I want colorless M&Ms.

      <'S'=on, scope-list="green">   I want green M&Ms.

      <'S'=off, scope-list="green">  I want green M&Ms, or else
                                     colorless M&Ms.

      <'S'=off, scope-list="">       I want colorless M&Ms.

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   Rules for Service Agents, for various combinations of settings of the
   'S' bit, and contents of the <scope-list>:

      <'S'=on, scope-list="">        I am a colorless M&M.

      <'S'=on, scope-list="green">   I am a green M&M, and always appear
                                     colorful.

      <'S'=off, scope-list="green">  I am a green M&M, but I'm happy to
                                     appear colorless.

      <'S'=off, scope-list="">       I am a colorless M&M.

   Rules for Directory Agents, for various combinations of settings of
   the 'S' bit, and contents of the <scope-list>:

      <'S'=on, scope-list="">        I am a jar for colorless M&Ms.

      <'S'=on, scope-list="green">   I am a jar for green M&Ms only.

      <'S'=off, scope-list="green">  I am a jar for green M&Ms, but I'm
                                     happy to accept colorless.

      <'S'=off, scope-list="">       I am a jar for colorless M&Ms.

   The intention motivating this algorithm for satisfying scoped service
   requests is to allow a smooth transition between administration of
   unscoped service domains into scoped service domains.  Notice that if
   a DA is installed and configured to offer scoped service, that user
   agents sending requests to that DA will typically be able to find
   the existing unscoped services until the services are configured for
   scope membership.  This should enable system administrators to become
   more familiar with the scope model without the need for "flag days"
   or discontinuous changeovers of services.

   If it is intended that all user agents be configured to request
   services from particular scopes, then while the user agents receive
   the necessary scope configuration information they will work as
   before in the unscoped administration until the time finally arrives
   when all user agents are configured with scopes.  After that time,
   all service agents can be configured to register their services with
   the 'S' bit set, and the user agents will all continue to work as
   before.


17.1.1. Scope Strings in SLP Messages

   Scope strings are found in several service location messages.  The
   <scope-list> takes the form of a <String -List > (see Section 20) of



Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 40]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   scope names.  The only characters which are reserved in scope strings
   are commas ',', asterisk '*' and the backslash character '\'.

   If this scope list is omitted, the message is said to be 'not
   scoped'.

   will explicitly exclude unscoped requests, as will be explained
   below.  The scope list may include '*' when multicasting requests to
   SAs, which specifies that scopes will be ignored for the purposes
   of handling the request.  The list may also include any other valid
   scope string.


17.1.2. Registration

   Services which are registered with a non-null scope list are
   considered 'scoped'.  A service registration which has no scope
   string is considered unscoped.  That means it will be registered with
   all DAs which do not explicitly refuse unscoped registrations.  A DA
   does this by setting the 'S' bit in its DAAdvert.

   A DA may be configured to be unscoped or scoped.  An unscoped DA
   accepts only unscoped registrations.  SAs MUST register all unscoped
   services with an unscoped DA. By default, a scoped DA will accept
   unscoped registrations.  A DA MUST be configurable to deny unscoped
   registrations.

   Scopes determine which requests a DA will accept.  A DA MUST decline
   to register a service if it is specified with an unsupported scope.
   In this case a SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED error is returned in the SrvAck.
   SAs MUST register scoped services with every DA they are aware of,
   that supports the service's scopes.


17.1.3. Query Handling

   In every case, the rules specified in Section 17.1 apply.

   UAs MUST use scoped DAs in preference to unscoped DAs, and unscoped
   DAs in preference to multicasting requests to SAs.  UAs MUST use
   scoped requests when making requests of scoped DAs.  UAs SHOULD use
   requests with no scope when multicasting requests to SAs.  UAs MUST
   use requests with no scope when sending a request to an unscoped DA.

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


17.1.3.1. DA Query Handling

   An unscoped DA accepts only unscoped requests.  It will reply with
   a SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED error if a scoped service registration is
   received.

   A scoped DA MUST accept only requests which have the scope of the DA
   or where the request is unscoped (ie.  the <scope-list> is omitted).
   The DA will respond with information which matches the request in
   the scope of the request AND unscoped service information.  If the
   request has the 'S' bit set in the message header, the DA will
   respond only with scoped service information.

   If a scoped DA receives a request which does not include a supported
   scope in its <scope-list>, or includes the string "*" the DA replies
   with a SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED error in the reply corresponding to the
   request.  This rule does not apply DA Discovery requests, which are
   described in Section 6.2.

   DAs will return a reply with 0 results if they support the request
   (ie.  do not return an error) and they have no matches to the
   request.


17.1.3.2. SA Query Handling

   SAs apply the same rules for matching requests except that if there
   is no match they will drop the request if there are no matches.  They
   will never reply with a SCOPE_NOT_SUPPORTED error.

   SAs which receive a request where the <scope-list> is set to the
   string "*" does not apply scope matching rules to the request.


17.2. Protected Scopes

   Scope membership MAY also define the security access and
   authorization for services in the scope; such scopes are called
   protected scopes.  If a UA wishes to be sure that SAs are authorized
   to provide the service they advertise, then the UA should request
   services from a protected scope which has been configured to have the
   necessary authentication mechanism and keys distributed to the SAs
   within the scope.  A directory agent distributing URLs for services
   in a protected scope will reject any registrations or deregistrations
   for service agents which cannot provide cryptographically strong
   authentication to prove their authorization to provide the services.

   For instance, if a campus registrar wishes to find a working printer
   to produce student grade information for mailing, the registrar would



Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 42]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   require the printing user agent to transmit the printable output only
   to those printing SAs which have been registered in the appropriate
   protected scope.  Notice that each service agent is, under normal
   circumstances, validated two times:  once when registering with
   the directory agent, and once when the user agent validates the
   URL received with the Service Reply.  This protects against the
   possibilities of malicious DAs as well as malicious SAs.

   Note that services in protected scopes provide separate
   authentication for their URL entry, and for their attributes.  This
   follows naturally from the needs of the protocol operation.  UAs
   which specify a service type and attributes needed for service in
   that service type will not receive attribute information from the
   directory agent; they will only receive the appropriate URL entries.
   Only the information returned needs to be authenticated.

   User agents which receive attribute information for a particular
   URL (see section 10), on the other hand, need to authenticate the
   attributes when they are returned (see section 11).  In this case,
   there may be much more data to authenticate, but this operation
   is also performed much less often, usually only while the user is
   browsing the available network resources.


18. Language Internationalization Issues

18.1. Language Tags and Dialects

   Service location messages often include a Language Tag in the header.
   A SrvDeReg message MAY omit a Language Tag if the service is to be
   deregistered in ALL languages it has been registered in.  If the
   Language Tag is omitted, the Language Tag length in the header is set
   to 0.

   If the Language Tag used includes a dialect, the dialect is to be
   used the following way:  Requests which can be fulfilled by matching
   a language and dialect will be preferred to those which match only
   the language portion.  Otherwise, dialects have no effect on matching
   requests.


18.2. Scope Strings are not Language Specific

   A scope string, which is used to configure DAs and which are used
   by both UAs and SAs for various operations (see Section 17.1) is
   NOT language specific.  Thus, the language declared in a SrvRqst
   used for DA discovery has no effect on whether the request predicate
   matches the scopes of the DA or not.  The DAAdvert does not include a
   Language Tag as the scope strings are not language specific.

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


18.3. Declaring the language of registrations

   All Service Registrations declare the language in which the strings
   in the service attributes are written by specifying a Language Tag
   in the message header.  For each language the Service advertises a
   separate registration takes place.  Each of these registrations uses
   the same URL to indicate that they refer to the same service.

   A Service is fully deregistered if the URL is given in the Service
   Deregister message without any attribute information or Language Tag
   sent in the message.

   If, on the other hand, attribute information is included in the
   Service Deregistration request, a separate Service Deregistration
   of selected attributes must be undertaken in each language in which
   service information has been provided to the DA by a SA.

   Service Registrations in different languages are mutually
   unintelligible.  They share no information except for their service
   type and URL with which they were registered.  No attempt is made
   to match queries with "language independence." Instead, queries are
   handled using string matching against registrations in the same
   language as the query.


18.4. Translation of Attribute Strings

   Service Types which are standardized will have definitions for
   all attributes and value strings.  Official translations to other
   languages of the attribute tags and values may be created and
   submitted as part of the standard; this is not feasible for all
   languages.  For those languages which are not defined as part of the
   Service Type, a best effort translation of the standard definitions
   of the Service type's attribute strings MAY be used.


18.5. Declaring the language of a Request

   Service and Attribute requests specify a requested language in the
   message header.  The DA or SA will respond in the same language as
   the request, if it has a registration in the same language as the
   request.

   If this language is not supported, and the Monolingual bit is not
   specified, a reply MAY be sent in the default language (which is
   English) on a best effort basis.  If no reply is possible, or if
   the 'monolingual bit' flag in the header is set and the requested
   language is not supported, a SrvRply is returned with the error field
   set to LANGUAGE_NOT_SUPPORTED.

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   If a query is in a supported language on a SA or DA, but has a
   different dialect than the available service information, the query
   MUST be serviced on a best-effort basis.  If possible, the query
   should be matched against the same dialect.  If that is not possible,
   it MAY be matched against any dialect of the same language.

   When there are several replies returned in one message and the reply
   includes attributes which were registered with separate dialects, the
   dialect portion of the Language Tag in the reply is dropped.  This
   could occurs primarily with an attribute reply.


19. Substitution of Character Escape Sequences

   Certain characters are illegal in certain contexts of the protocol.
   Since the protocol is largely character string based, in some
   contexts characters are used as protocol delimiters.  In these cases
   the delimiting characters must not be used as 'data text.'

   Characters which are reserved as part of the encoding of attribute
   tags or values MUST be escaped if they are included in Attribute
   Lists or Predicates.  Any character in these strings MAY be escaped.

   The escape mechanism uses the reserved backslash character '\' (ASCII
   0x5c).  This character is followed by two hexadecimal digits of the
   escaped character.  Note that some characters are multibyte, using
   UTF8 encoding.

   Examples:

    Character to encode Unicode UTF8      SLP Escaped value
    ------------------- ------- --------- -----------------
    ','                 0x0029  0x0029    \29
    e accent aigue      0x0039  0xc3a9    \c3\a9
    not equals glyph    0x2260  0xe289a0  \e2\89\a0


   Characters in URLs which are reserved according to the URL syntax
   specification must be escaped using the URL escape character
   convention.  In this case a 'percent' is followed by the hex encoding
   of the escaped character exactly as defined above for the 'slash'
   character.  The current URL syntax specification limits all encoded
   characters to a subset of the ASCII character set.  The update to
   this defines a way to transmit UTF8 encoded characters outside of the
   ASCII range.

19.1. Language-Independent Strings

   Some strings, such as Service Type names, have standard definitions.
   These reserved strings should be considered as tokens and not as
   words in a language to be translated.  They are case-independent.

20.1. Previous Responders' Address Specification

   The previous responders' Address Specification is specified as a
   <String-List> of <addr-spec> terms.

   The Address Specification is the address of the DA or SA
   which supplied the previous response.  The format for Address
   Specifications in Service Location is defined in section 20.3.  The
   use of dotted decimal IP address notation should only be used in
   environments which have no Domain Name Service.

   Example:

         RESOLVO.NEATO.ORG,128.127.203.63

   SAs or DAs which are listed in a Previous Responders list in a
   multicast Service Location request will silently discard the request.

   Depending on the length of the request, around 60 previous responders
   may be listed in a single datagram.  If there are more responders
   than this, the scaling mechanisms described in section D should be
   used.

20.1.1. Service Type String

   The Service Type is a string describing the type of service.  These
   strings may only be comprised of alphanumeric characters, '+', and
   '-'.  Upper case is considered equivalent to lower case in Service
   Type names.

   The Service Type of a service:  scheme URL is encoded as the string
   up to and including the last ":".  This includes the Naming Authority
   string.

      URL                                   Service Type String
      -----------------------------------   ------------------
      service:lpr://biglaser.dog.com        service:lpr:
      service:wp:http://dir.cat.org         service:wp:
      service:game.cs312://morb.lug.edu     service:game.cs312:
      ftp://ftpserv.mouse.gov               ftp:



20.1.2. String List

   String lists transmitted by the service location protocol are items
   with a ',' delimiter.

   str-list = str-item / str-item ',' str-list

   The definition of <str-item> depends on the string list.  For a
   DAAdvert, the <str-item> is a scope attribute value (see <strval>
   in Section 20.2).  The other important case is described in
   Section 20.1, which may be included with SrvRqst, AttrRqst and
   SrvTypeRqst messages.


20.1.3. Select List

   Select Lists are String List used in AttrRqst and SrvDeReg messages.
   The <str-item> is a <tag-filter> with the following syntax:

   tag-filter = simple-tag / substring
   simple-tag = 1*filt-char
   substring = [initial] any [final]
   initial = 1*filt-char
     any = '*' *(filt-char '*')
   final = 1*filt-char
   filt-char = Any character excluding <reserved> and <bad-tag> See
         Section 20.2.

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


20.2. Attribute Information

   The <attr-list> is returned in the Attribute Reply if the Attribute
   Request does not result in an empty result.

   attr-list = attribute / attribute ',' attr-list
   attribute = '(' attr-tag '=' attr-val-list ')' / attr-tag
   attr-val-list = attr-val / attr-val ',' attr-val-list
   attr-tag = 1*safe-tag
   attr-val = intval / strval / boolval / opaque
   intval = [-]1*DIGIT
   strval = 1*safe-val
   boolval = "TRUE" / "FALSE"
   opaque = "(" 1*DIGIT ":" 1*r64chars ")"
   safe-val = Any character except reserved.
   safe-tag = Any character except reserved, star and bad-tag.
   reserved = '(' / ')' / ',' / '\' / '!'  / '<' / '=' / '>' / 'tilde'
   bad-tag = CR / LF / HT
    star = '*'
   r64chars = DIGIT / ALPHA / '=' / '/' / '-'

   An <attr-list> must be scanned prior to evaluation for all
   occurrences of the escape character '\'.  Reserved characters in
   attributes placed in attribute lists must be escaped.  All escaped
   characters must be restored to their value before used for string
   matching.  See Section 19.

   A keyword has only an <attr-tag>, and no values.

         (OPERATOR=Joe Javaman)
         (COLOR=RED\, WHITE\, BLUE)
         (DELAY=10 MINS), BUSY, (LATEST BUILD=10-5-95), (PRIORITY=L,M,H)

   The third example has three attributes in the list.  Color takes
   the value "RED, WHITE, BLUE" (the commas in the value string are
   escaped).  Priority, on the other hand, takes the three values "L",
   "M", and "H".  There are several other examples of attribute lists
   throughout the document.


20.3. Address Specification in Service Location

   The address specification used in Service Location is:

     <addr-spec> ::= [<user> ':' <password> '@' ] <host> [ ':' <port>]

     <host>      ::= Fully qualified domain name /
                     dotted decimal IP address notation




Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 49]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   When no Domain Name Server is available, SAs and DAs must use dotted
   decimal conventions for IP addresses.  Otherwise, it is preferable to
   use a fully qualified domain name wherever possible as renumbering of
   host addresses will make IP addresses invalid over time.

   Generally, just the host domain name (or address) is returned.
   When there is a non-standard port for the protocol, that should be
   returned as well.  Passwords SHOULD NOT be sent with SLP messages
   (as cleartext) unless an IPSec ESP is used for delivery of the SLP
   message.

   Address specification in Service Location is consistent with standard
   URL format [4].


20.4. Attribute Value encoding rules

   Attribute values, and attribute tags are CASE INSENSITIVE for
   purposes of lexical comparison.

   The syntax of attribute values is described in Section 20.2.

   While an attribute can take any value, there are three types
   of values which differentiate themselves from general strings:
   Booleans, Integers and Opaque values.

    -  Boolean values are either "TRUE" or "FALSE".  This is the case
       regardless of the language strings are encoded in.  Boolean
       attributes can take only one value.

    -  Integer values are expressed as a sequence of DIGITs.  The
       range of allowable values for integers is "-2147483648" to
       "2147483647".  No other form of numeric representation is
       interpreted as such except integers.  For example, hexadecimal
       numbers such as "0x342" are not interpreted as integers, but as
       strings.

    -  Opaque values (i.e.  binary values) are expressed in radix-64
       notation.  The syntax is:

            <opaque-val>    ::=  "(" <len> ":" <radix-64-data> ")"
            <len>           ::=  1*DIGIT
            <radix-64-data> ::=  radix-64 encoding of the original data

       <len> is a 16-bit binary number expressed as a decimal string.
       For example, if the opaque value is 34 bytes long before encoding
       the <len> field would be the string "34".





Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 50]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


       Radix-64 encodes every 3 bytes of binary data into 4 bytes of
       ASCII data which is in the range of characters which are fully
       printable and transferable by mail.  For a formal definition of
       the Radix-64 format see RFC 1521 [5], MIME Part One, Section 5.2
       Base64 Content Transfer Encoding, page 21.

       The Opaque value encoding includes otherwise reserved
       characters in attribute values:  '(', ')'.  It may include
       another reserved character:  '='.  These characters
       are escaped in SrvRqst predicates.  For example
       "(&(service-type=thing)(att=\(3:AAAA\)))" is a query for
       a service of type "thing" which has an attribute "att" with a
       value of a 3 zero bytes.


21. Protocol Timing Rules

   There are four protocol actions which require timing rules.  Active
   DA Discovery, Passive DA Advertising, reliable unicast requests to a
   DA and multicast/convergence.


21.1. Active DA Discovery

   After a UA or SA restarts (say, after rebooting of a system or
   loading of the network kernel), their initial DA discovery request
   should be delayed for some random time uniformly distributed from 0
   to CONFIG_START_WAIT seconds.

   DA Discovery requests should be sent according to CONFIG_DA_RETRY.
   The second and third transmission of the DA Discovery request MUST
   include a previous responders list of all DAs which have responded.
   See Section 20.1 and 12.

   SAs which discover DAs actively must wait CONFIG_REG_ACTIVE seconds
   before registering their services.


21.2. Passive DA Advertising

   Every CONFIG_DA_BEAT seconds a DA will multicast or broadcast an
   unsolicited DAAdvert.  This will ensure that eventually it will be
   discovered by all applications which are concerned.

   All SAs which receive the unsolicited DAAdvert should examine its
   Sequence Number.  If the DA has never before been heard from or if
   the Sequence Number is less than it was previously and less than 256,
   the SA should assume the DA does not have its service registration,
   even if it once did.  If this is the case and the DA has the proper



Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 51]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   scope, the SA should register all service information with the DA,
   after waiting a random interval CONFIG_REG_PASSIVE.

   While it might seem advantageous to have frequent heartbeats, this
   generates traffic throughout the network in proportion to the number
   of DAs.  Thus, CONFIG_DA_BEAT should be specified with a value in
   seconds long enough to prevent routine protocol operations from using
   any significant bandwidth.


21.3. Reliable Unicast to DAs

   If a DA fails to respond to a unicast UDP message in CONFIG_DA_RETRY
   seconds, the message should be retried.  If a DA fails to respond
   after CONFIG_DA_MAX seconds, the UA or SA should use a different DA.

   DA addresses may be cached from previous discovery attempts,
   preconfigured, or by use of DHCP (see section 16.1).

   If no such DA responds, DA discovery should be used to find a new DA.
   Care should be taken not to do Active DA Discovery more than once per
   CONFIG_DA_FIND seconds.


21.4. Multicast/Convergence

   This algorithm is used by UAs to send requests to SAs using the
   Service Location General Multicast Address.  The algorithm is used by
   both UAs and SAs to send DA Discovery requests to DAs using the DA
   Discovery Multicast Address.

   Requests to SAs are multicast repeatedly (with a recommended wait
   interval of CONFIG_MC_RETRY) until there are no new responses, or
   CONFIG_MC_MAX seconds have elapsed.  DA discovery requests use
   different timing for repeated requests, CONFIG_DA_RETRY.

   Repeated requests include a previous responder list, see
   Section 20.1.


22. Configurable Parameters and Default Values

   There are several configuration parameters for Service Location.
   Default values are chosen to allow protocol operation without the
   need for selection of these configuration parameters, but other
   values may be selected by the site administrator.  The configurable
   parameters will allow an implementation of Service Location to be
   more useful in a variety of scenarios.

      Multicast vs.  Broadcast
               All Service Location entities must use multicast by
               default.  The ability to use broadcast messages must be
               configurable for UAs and SAs.  Broadcast messages are to
               be used in environments where not all Service Location
               entities have hardware or software which supports
               multicast.

      Multicast Radius
               Multicast requests should be sent to all subnets in a
               site.  The default multicast radius for a site is 32.
               This value MUST be configurable.

      Directory Agent Address
               The DA address discovery mechanism must be configurable.
               There are three possibilities for this configuration:  A
               default address, no default address and the use of DHCP
               to locate a DA as described in section 16.1.  The default
               value should be use of DHCP, with "no default address"
               used if DHCP does not respond.  In this case the UA or SA
               must do a Directory Agent Discovery query.

      Directory Agent Scope Assignment
               The scope or scopes of a DA must be configurable.  The
               default value for a DA is to have no scope if not
               otherwise configured.

      Path MTU
               The default path MTU is assumed to be 1400.  This value
               MUST be configurable for all SAs and DAs.

      Keys for Protected Scopes

               If the local administration designates certain scopes as
               "protected scopes", the agents making use of those scopes
               MUST able to acquire keys to authenticate data sent by
               services along with their advertised URLs for services
               within the protected scope.  For instance, SAs would
               use a private key to produce authentication data.  By
               default, service agents use "md5WithRSAEncryption" [3] to
               produce the signed data, to be be included with service
               registrations and deregistrations (see appendix B, 4.4).
               This authentication data could be verified by user agents
               and directory agents that possess the corresponding
               public key.


22.2. Service Agent:  Use Predefined Directory Agent(s)

   A SA's default configuration is to do passive and active DA discovery
   and to register with all DAs which are properly scoped.

   A SA SHOULD be configurable to allow a special mode of operation:
   They will use only preconfigured DAs.  This means they will *NOT*
   actively or passively detect DAs.

   If a SA is configured this way, knowledge of the DA must come through
   another channel, either static configuration or by the use of DHCP.

   The availability of the Service information will not be consistent
   between DAs.  The mechanisms which achieve eventual consistency
   between DAs are ignored by the SA, so their service information will
   not be distributed.  This leaves the SA open to failure if the DA
   they are configured to use fails.


23. Security Considerations

   The Service Location Protocol provides for authentication of Service
   Information registered by SAs and DA Advertisements.  This allows
   UAs to obtain information about services with confidence that is
   reasonably complete and accurate.

   Service Location does not provide confidentiality.  Because the
   objective of this protocol is to advertise services to a community
   of users, confidentiality might not generally be needed when this
   protocol is used in non-sensitive environments.  Specialized schemes
   might be able to provide confidentiality, if needed in the future.
   Sites requiring confidentiality should implement the IP Encapsulating
   Security Payload (ESP) [13] to provide confidentiality for Service
   Location messages.

   Using unprotected scopes, an adversary might easily use this protocol
   to advertise services on servers controlled by the adversary and
   thereby gain access to users' private information.  Further, an
   adversary using this protocol will find it much easier to engage in
   selective denial of service attacks.  Sites that are in potentially
   hostile environments (e.g.  are directly connected to the Internet)
   SHOULD use protected scopes.

   Service Location is useful as a bootstrap protocol.  It may be used
   in environments in which no preconfiguration is possible.  In such
   situations, a certain amount of "blind faith" is required:  Without
   any prior configuration it is impossible to use any of the security
   mechanisms described above.  Service Location will make use of
   the mechanisms provided by the Security Area of the IETF for key
   distribution as they become available.  At this point it would only
   be possible to gain the benefits associated with the use of protected
   scopes if some cryptographic information can be preconfigured with
   the end systems before they use Service Location.  For UAs, this
   could be as simple as supplying the public key of a Certificate
   Authority.  See Appendix B.

A. Version 2 Notes

   This document revises the Service Location Protocol as specified in
   RFC 2165.  There are some open issues which are resolved here.  Some
   of these are protocol corrections (which result in a change in the on
   the protocol as it is exchanged over the wire.)  Some of the changes
   to the document are merely clarifications and document restructuring.

      Clarifications


                 SrvTypeRqst definition
                                  SrvTypeRqst does not include a list of
                                  previously received service types as
                                  was erroneously indicated.

                 Opaque value syntax
                                  The ``(`` and ``)'' characters
                                  enclosing an opaque value are to be
                                  taken literally.  The length of the
                                  opaque value is to be encoded as a
                                  decimal number.

                 Scopes
                                  Are NOT language specific strings.
                                  All scope rules have been coalesced
                                  into a single section.  The rules for
                                  when to use unscoped requests and
                                  registrations have been clarified as
                                  well as the consequences of receiving
                                  them and the behavior of unscoped DAs.

                 Requirements
                                  The requirements section has been
                                  redone in a simpler matrix style,
                                  with references to the protocol
                                  section, reflecting *all* protocol
                                  requirements.

                 Wild Card values in search filters
                                  Wild card values are only intended to
                                  be used for string MATCHING not string
                                  COMPARISONS.

                 Service Type Reply strings
                                  The definition of the reply strings
                                  needs to be clarified and allow for
                                  arbitrary URL schemes.

                 Security considerations
                                  The security section has been updated
                                  to reflect the changes made to the
                                  certificate format section and the
                                  ability to sign DAAdverts.

                 AttrRqst select-list length
                                  The length of the select-list is the
                                  length of the select-list string,
                                  which is the common convention in SLP.

      Modifications


                 Crypto Algorithm field in Service requests
                                 The UA requires a way to specify which
                                 crypto algorithm it can use, if it is
                                 not the default, so the DA or SA can
                                 determine what to use.

                 Version Number
                                 Since the wire protocol has changed,
                                 the version number of the protocol
                                 takes the version number 2.

                 Character Encoding
                                 Character encodings are all be in
                                 UTF8 [19].  This conforms to current
                                 IESG recommendations and simplifies the
                                 protocol.

                 Service Request Predicates
                                 Service Request Predicate grammar have
                                 been replaced by the request grammar
                                 used by LDAP string search filters.
                                 Some conventions are necessary to
                                 ensure proper structure of requests.
                                 The simple 'list format' queries is no
                                 longer supported.

                 Character escapes in string encoding
                                 To be consistent with the LDAP
                                 string search filters syntax and to
                                 simplify the encoding rules in SLP,
                                 all character escapes in SLP string
                                 based messages reserve the backslash
                                 character as an escape for reserved
                                 characters.  Character escapes in

                                 URLs conform to standard URL syntax
                                 conventions.

                 Fresh Bit Handling
                                 The Fresh bit is transmitted by SAs to
                                 DAs to indicate freshness, not returned
                                 by DAs to SAs in the acknowledgement of
                                 registration.  This allowed for a race
                                 condition.

                 URL handling
                                 SLPv1 only supports service: URLs.
                                 It now supports arbitrary URLs
                                 provided that they follow standard
                                 URL syntax.  This support modifies
                                 SrvRply, AttrRqst, SrvReg, DAAdvert and
                                 SrvDeReg.

                 DAAdvert format
                                 The DAAdvert message contains new
                                 information:  It indicates whether it
                                 was sent as the result of a service
                                 request or at the DA's own initiative.
                                 It can also carry a digital signature
                                 of the DAAdvert.  The DA may also mark
                                 some of the scopes it advertises in
                                 as 'protected' and provide a pointer
                                 to the protected scope's certificate.
                                 DAAdverts no longer override the XID
                                 in the header, but instead carry a
                                 'DAAdvert sequence number'.

                 Request Flagging
                                 The header indicates whether a request
                                 was multicast or unicast.  This aids
                                 interpretation of the request by SAs
                                 and DAs implemented on platforms which
                                 receive all datagram requests from the
                                 same socket and cannot distinguish
                                 between the 'destination' address of
                                 the datagram they received.

                 String Interpretation
                                 Strings are interpreted in line with
                                 other string based query protocols:
                                 Interior white space is folded to
                                 a single white space rather than
                                 interpreted literally for string
                                 matching.

                 Language Tagging
                                 The reserved Dialect field is used for
                                 inclusion of RFC 1766 language tags
                                 (or whatever obsoletes them.)  This is
                                 in accord with the new guidelines for
                                 internationalization.

                 SLP Certificate format
                                 The certificate format needs an
                                 additional field indicating the name
                                 of the CA. There also needs to be text
                                 which encourages the use of standard
                                 certificate formats if possible (X.509,
                                 etc.)

                 Requirements
                                 The requirement that SAs handle
                                 SrvTypeRqst and AttrRqst has been
                                 relaxed from a SHOULD to a MAY. The
                                 requirement that a UA be able to issue
                                 a SrvTypeRqst and AttrRqst has been
                                 relaxed from a MUST to a SHOULD. The
                                 requirement that UAs be able to use
                                 multicast/convergence has been relaxed
                                 from a MUST to a SHOULD (provided that
                                 DHCP is used for DA discovery!)  This
                                 allows conformant implementations to be
                                 much more lightweight.

                 Service Location Extension Options
                                 These options allow for the protocol to
                                 be enhanced without requiring the main
                                 protocol specification standardization
                                 to be derailed.

                 Lifetime may be too short
                              It may be that timeouts for soft state are
                              too short.  We may want to make the URL
                              entry's Lifetime field be longer than 2
                              bytes worth of seconds.

                 Allow the tag list in SrvDeReg to include wildcards
                              This would allow for deletions of
                              attributes with patterns, such as all
                              entries with a common prefix.  This
                              facilitates efficient name deletion based
                              on a hierarchical structure.

                 Include a MIN, MAX and BEST operator for queries
                              MIN and MAX would be used for integer
                              query terms - to allow the service with
                              the smallest or largest value for a given
                              attribute to be returned.  BEST would be
                              a string match which would return the
                              service(s) for which the longest substring
                              match could be found.

                 Allow increasing ring multicast discovery
                              This would allow the 'nearest' services to
                              be discovered.

                 Use multicast based de/registration of services
                              This would eliminate a scaling issue in
                              the protocol but would require the use of
                              MTCP-like techniques so that SAs could
                              moderate their refresh intervals so that
                              SLP registration take only a fixed amount
                              of network bandwidth.

                 LDAP search filters
                              Should LDAPv2 filters [11, 18, 12] be
                              used, since they rely on Draft Standard
                              protocols?  Or, should SLP use the
                              new LDAPv3 filters (which have not
                              yet gone to PS)? The latter handle
                              internationalization far better!


B. SLP Certificates

   Certificates may be used in SLP in order to distribute the public
   keys of trusted protected scopes.  This section defines a very
   simple format for certificates which provides only the most basic
   functionality required for deploying protected scopes.  If a public

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   key infrastructure has already been deployed, for instance using
   X.509 certificates, these SHOULD be used instead.  Implementation of
   SLP Certificates is entirely OPTIONAL.

   Possession of the private key of a protected scope is equivalent
   to being a trusted SA. The trustworthiness of the protected scope
   depends upon all of these private keys being held by trusted
   hosts, and used only for legitimate service registrations and
   deregistrations.

   With access to the proper Certificate Authority (CA), DAs and UAs
   do not need (in advance) hold public keys which correspond to these
   protected scopes.  They do require the public key of the CA. The CA
   produces certificates using its unique private key.  This private key
   is not shared with any other system, and must remain secure.  The
   certificates declare that a given protected scope has a given public
   key, as well as the expiration date of the certificate.

   The ASCII (mail-safe) string format for the certificate is the
   following list of tag and value pairs:

   The radix-64 notation is described in RFC 1521 [5].  Spaces are
   ignored in the computation of the binary value corresponding to a
   Radix-64 string.  If the value for scope, public-key or cert-digest
   is greater than 72 characters, the Radix-64 notation may be broken
   up on to separate lines.  The continuation lines must be preceded
   by one or more spaces.  Only the tags listed above may start in the
   first column of the certificate string.  This removes ambiguity in
   parsing the Radix-64 values (since the tags consist of legal Radix-64
   values.)

   The certificate-auth identifies the authority who created the
   certificate.  This enables a very unsophisticated mechanism for
   enabling the use of multiple certificate authorities:  An end
   system may be configured with public keys for multiple certificate
   authorities.  In each case the public key will be identified by
   a 'certificate-auth' string as part of the configuration.  When
   certificates are obtained, they may use the 'certificate-auth' field
   to determine which public key to use to verify the certificate's
   validity.

   The certificate-alg is the ASN.1 string for the Object Identifier
   value of the algorithm used to produce the "cert-digest".  The
   scope-charset is a decimal representation of the MIBEnum value for
   the character set in which the scope is represented.

   The radix-64 encoding of the scope string will allow the ASCII
   rendering of a scope string any character set.

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   The 8 byte NTP format timestamp is represented as 16 hex digits.
   This timestamp is the time at which the certificate will expire.

   The format for the public key will depend on the type of cryptosystem
   used, which is identified by the certificate-alg.  When the CA
   generated the certificate holding the public key being obtained,
   it used the message digest algorithm identified by certificate-alg
   to calculate a digest D on the string encoding of the certificate,
   excepting the cert-digest.  The CA then encrypted this value using
   the CA's private key to produce the cert-digest, which is included in
   the certificate.

   The CA generates the certificate off-line.  The mechanism to
   distribute certificates is not specified in the Service Location
   Protocol, but may be in the future.  The CA specifies the algorithms
   to use for message digest and public key decryption.  The DA or SA
   need only obtain the certificate, have a preconfigured public key for
   the CA and support the algorithm specified in the certificate-alg in
   order to obtain certified new public keys for protected scopes.

   The DA or UA may confirm the certificate by calculating the message
   digest D, using the message digest algorithm identified by the
   certificate-alg.  The input to the message digest algorithm is the
   string encoding of the certificate, excepting the cert-digest.
   The cert-digest is decrypted using the CA's public key to produce
   D'. If D is the same as D', the certificate is legitimate.  The
   public-key for the protected scope may be used until the expiration
   date indicated by the certificate timestamp.

   The certificate may be distributed along untrusted channels, such as
   email or through file transfer, as it must be verified anyhow.  The
   CA's public key must be delivered using a trusted channel.


C. Example of deploying SLP security using MD5 and RSA

   In our site, we have a protected scope "CONTROLLED".  We generate a
   private key - public key pair for the scope, using RSA. The private
   key is maintained on a secret key ring by all SAs in the protected
   scope.  The public key is available to all DAs which support the
   protected scope and to all UAs which will use it.

   In order to register or deregister a URL, the data required to be
   authenticated (as described in section 4.4) is digestified using
   MD5 [16] to create a digital signature, then encrypted by RSA with
   the protected scope's private key.  The output of RSA is used in the
   authentication data field of the authentication block.

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   The DA or UA discovers the appropriate method for verifying the
   authentication by looking inside the authentication block.  Suppose
   that the "md5WithRSAEncryption" [3] algorithm has to be used
   to verify the signed data.  The DA or UA calculates the message
   digest of the URL Entry by using md5, exactly as the SA did.  The
   authentication block is decrypted using the public key for the
   "CONTROLLED" scope, which is stored in the public key ring of the UA
   or DA under the name "CONTROLLED".  If the digest calculated by the
   UA or DA matches that of the SA, the URL Entry has been validated.


D. Scaling and Deployment of the Service Location Protocol

   The Service Location Protocol is meant to be deployable in a variety
   of network configurations.  The protocol is ideal for 'plug and play'
   networks, which have the minimum of services offered.  It also will
   scale to sites, with many routed networks, even over wide-area low
   bandwidth links.

   The key to SLP's scalability is how it is configured in the default
   case and how it can be configured for use in larger deployments.

   The default configuration for SLP requires it to discover DAs and if
   possible, to use them.  This ensures that even in a larger deployment
   SLP will not use multicast or broadcast more than necessary.  Thus
   SLP will not require much network bandwidth for its operation.

   If there are no DAs, as would be the case in the simplest
   configuration, UAs will multicast (or broadcast) their requests to
   SAs.  This allows a network of client applications and services to be
   set up with no configuration; no DNS, no DHCP, and so on.  This is a
   useful feature for extremely small networks, such as in a conference
   room.

   DAs are provided for scalability.  The protocol works identically
   whether DAs are present or not (UAs issue the same requests to either
   SAs or DAs, and get the same replies.)  The only difference is
   efficiency and scalability.

   The scoping feature of SLP provides further scalability.  Services
   which are scoped will be attracted to the subset of DAs which support
   their scope.  UAs will go to the DAs which supply service information
   in the scope they are configured to use, or the scope which the user
   selects if the UA is not configured with a scope.

   In some cases multicast cannot be used to discover DAs.  In others,
   administration Blocks may decide that they would prefer to control
   the way DAs are used.  Here, DHCP may be used to configure UAs and
   SAs with the location of DAs.  This is particularly useful for



Guttman,Perkins,Veizades         Expires 30 April 1998         [Page 66]

Internet Draft         Service Location Protocol         30 October 1997


   configuring hosts which are networked via slow wide-area links.  It
   would be a waste of scarce network bandwidth to use a multicast
   routing protocol to distribute DA advertisements over such a link.

   There is no guarantee that a DA of a particular scope will contain
   the same service information as another DA in the same scope.  This
   consistency is only achieved when all SAs which advertise services
   in that scope are aware of the same set of DAs.  This may not be
   possible, if multicast routing does not pervade the entire site or if
   DHCP does not uniformly configure SAs with the same scope to use the
   same DAs.

   Indeed, it may not even be desirable to allow such pervasive use
   of multicast nor even be required for useful 'best effort' service
   provision for there to be a consistent view of services from all DAs
   of the same scope.  This is a decision which network administrators
   of SLP in large sites need to consider.  The more consistency
   they wish to achieve between DAs, the more complicated their DHCP
   configuration will be, or the more SLP based multicast traffic they
   will have in their networks.
