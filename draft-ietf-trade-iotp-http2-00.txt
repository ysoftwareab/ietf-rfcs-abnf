Abstract

   Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP) messages will be carried as
   Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents.  As such, the goal of
   mapping to the transport layer is to ensure that the underlying XML
   documents are carried successfully between the various parties.  This
   document describes that mapping for the Hyper Text Transport Protocol
   (HTTP), Versions 1.0 and 1.1, and the location of HTTP based IOTP
   services using the SRV domain name system resource record.

INTERNET-DRAFT            IOTP HTTP Supplement              October 2003


1. Introduction

   Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP) [RFC2801] messages are carried
   as XML [XML] documents.  As such, the goal of mapping to the
   transport layer is to ensure that the underlying XML documents are
   carried successfully between the various parties.

   This document describes that mapping for the Hyper Text Transport
   Protocol (HTTP), Versions 1.0 and 1.1 [RFCs 1945, 2616], and the
   location of IOTP services using the SRV domain name system resource
   record [RFC 2782, draft-ietf-trade-srv-higher-services].

   There may be future documents describing IOTP over email (SMTP), TCP,
   cable TV, or other transports.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



2. HTTP Servers and Clients

   The structure of IOTP maps onto the structure of HTTP in the
   following way:

      The merchant, payment handler, delivery handler, and customer care
      roles are all represented by HTTP servers.  Each may be
      represented by a separate server, or they may be combined in any
      combination.

      The consumer role is represented by an HTTP client, possibly a
      browser.

   Note: A Merchant, may act in the role of a consumer, for example to
   deposit electronic cash.  In this case the Merchant, as an
   organization rather than as a role, would need to be supported by an
   HTTP client.



3. HTTP Net Locations

   The Net Locations specified by URIs [RFC 2396] within the IOTP
   specification or by a domain name at which a service is required.  If
   a secure connection is required or desired a secure channel that both
   the HTTP Server and Client support MUST be used. Examples of such
   channels are SSL version 3 or TLS [RFC 2246].

   To locate an IOTP service at a domain name, the SRV DNS resource

INTERNET-DRAFT            IOTP HTTP Supplement              October 2003


   record is used as describe in [draft-ietf-trade-srv-higher-services].
   The higher level service tokens to be used are as follows:

      Service    Token

      customer   _iotp-customer
      merchant   _iotp-merchant
      payment    _iotp-payment
      delivery   _iotp-delivery
      care       _iotp-care



4. Consumer Clients

   In most environments, the consumer agent will initially be an HTML
   browser.  However, current browsers do not provide the needed
   capability to act as an agent for the consumer for an IOTP
   ptransaction. This leads to two requirements:

      a method of starting and passing control to the IOTP client, and

      a method of closing down the IOTP client cleanly and passing
      control back to the HTML browser once the IOTP Transaction has
      finished.



4.1 Starting the IOTP Client and the Merchant IOTP Server

   At some point, the HTTP client at the consumer will send an HTTP
   request that is interpreted as an "IOTP Startup Request" by the
   Merchant HTTP server.  This might, for example, be the result of
   clicking on a "pay" button.  This message is a stand-in for a request
   message of some form and the Merchant Server will respond with the
   first IOTP Message in the form of an XML document.

   The MIME type for all IOTP messages is: "APPLICATION/IOTP"; however
   "APPLICATION/X-IOTP" has been in use for experimentation and
   development and SHOULD also be recognized.  See section 7 below for
   the MIME type registration template for APPLICATION/IOTP.  Because
   HTTP is binary clean, no content-transfer-encoding is required.  (See
   [RFC 2376] re the application/xml type which has some similar
   considerations.)

   This HTTP response will be interpreted by the HTML browser as a
   request to start the application associated with MIME type
   "APPLICATION/IOTP", and to pass the content of this message to that
   application.

INTERNET-DRAFT            IOTP HTTP Supplement              October 2003


   At this point, the IOTP client will be started and have the first
   message.

   IOTP messages are short-lived. Therefore, the HTTP server SHOULD
   avoid having its responses cached.  In HTTP V1.0, the "nocache"
   pragma can be used.  This can be neglected on SSL/TLS secured
   connections which are not cached and on HTTP POST requests in HTTP
   v1.1 as in v1.1 POST responses are not cached.



4.2 Ongoing IOTP Messages

   Data from earlier IOTP Messages in a transaction MUST be retained by
   the IOTP Client so that it may (1) be copied to make up part of later
   IOTP messages, (2) used in calculations to verify signatures in later
   IOTP message, (3) be resent in some cases where a request has timed
   out without response, (4) used as input to the Customer Care role in
   later versions of IOTP, etc.  The way in which the data is copied
   depends on the IOTP Transaction.  The data MUST be retained until the
   end of the transaction, whether by success, failure, or cancelation,
   and as long thereafter as it is desired for any of the parties to
   inquire into it.

   The IOTP messages contain Net Locations (e.g. the PayReqNetLocn)
   which for HTTP will contain the URIs to which the IOTP client MUST
   send IOTP messages.

   Subsequent IOTP messages (XML documents) will be sent using the POST
   function of HTTP.  The HTTP client MUST perform full HTTP POST
   requests.

   The XML documents MUST be sent in a manner compatible with the
   external encodings allowed by the XML [XML] specification.



4.3 Stopping an IOTP Transaction

   The following should be read in conjunction with [RFC 2801].

   An IOTP Transaction is complete when

   -- the IOTP client decides to fail the IOTP Transaction for some
      reason either by canceling the transaction or as a result of
      discovering an error in an IOTP message received, or

   -- a "time out" occurs or a connection fails, e.g. a response to an
      IOTP Message, has not been received after some user-defined period
      of Time (including retransmissions).


D. Eastlake, C. Smith                                           [Page 5]


INTERNET-DRAFT            IOTP HTTP Supplement              October 2003


   An IOTP Client which processes an IOTP Transaction which:

   -- completes successfully (i.e. it has not received an Error Block
      with a HardError or a Cancel Block) MUST direct the browser to the
      Net Location specified in SuccessNetLocn in the Protocol Options
      Component, i.e., cause it to do an HTTP GET with that URL.

   -- does not complete successfully, because it has received some Error
      Trading Block, MUST display the information in the Error Message,
      stop the transaction, and pass control to the browser so that it
      will do a GET on the Error Net Location specified for the role
      from which the error was received.

   -- is cancelled since a Cancel Block has been received, MUST stop the
      IOTP Transaction and hand control to the browser so that it will
      do a GET on the on the Cancel Net Location specified for the role
      from which the Cancel Block was received.

   -- is in error because an IOTP Message does not conform to this
      specification, MUST send an IOTP Message containing a Error
      Trading Block to role from which the erroneous message was
      received and the ErrorLogNetLoc specified for that role, stop the
      IOTP Transaction, and hand control to the browser so that it will
      do a GET from the Error Net Location specified for the role from
      which the bad message was received.

   -- has a "time out", MUST display a message describing the time out.
      May give the user the option of cancelling or retrying and/or may
      automatically retry.  On failure due to time out, treat as an
      error above.

   Each implementation of an IOTP client may decide whether or not to
   terminate the IOTP Client application immediately upon completing an
   IOTP Transaction or whether to wait until it is closed down as a
   result of, for example, user shut down or browser shut down.



5. Starting the Payment handler and Deliverer IOTP Servers

   Payment Handler and Deliverer IOTP Servers are started by receiving
   an IOTP Message which contains:

   -- for a Payment handler, a Payment Request Block, and

   -- for a Delivery Handler, a Delivery Request Block

INTERNET-DRAFT            IOTP HTTP Supplement              October 2003


6. Security Considerations

   Security of Internet Open Trade Protocol messages is primarily
   dependent on signatures within IOTP as described in [RFC 2801] and
   [RFC 2802].  Privacy protection for IOTP interactions can be obtained
   by using a secure channel for IOTP messages, such as SSL/TLS [RFC
   2246].

   Note that the security of payment protocols transported by IOTP is
   the responsibility of those payment protocols, not of IOTP.



7. IANA Considerations

   This specification carries forward the specification APPLICATION/IOTP
   MIME type which has been registered.  (See the registration template
   in [RFC 2935] and in the IANA records.)



Changes from RFC 2935

   1. Addition of means to locate IOTP services via the SRV resource.

   2. Update references for more recent versions.

   3. Update author inforamtion.
