    Information Model of Control-Plane and User-Plane separation BNG
              draft-wcg-i2rs-cu-separation-infor-model-00

Abstract

   To improve network resource utilization and reduce the operation
   expense, the Control-Plane and User-Plane separation conception is
   raised [draft-gu-nfvrg-cloud-bng-architecture-00].  This document
   describes the information model for the interface between Control-
   Plane and User-Plane separation BNG.  This information model may
   involve both control channel interface and configuration channel
   interface.  The interface for control channel allows the Control-
   Plane to send the user's information table to the User-Plane, and the
   User-Plane to report the statistics information to the Control-Plane,
   etc.  The interface for configuration channel is in charge of the
   version negotiation between the CP and UP, the configuration for the
   devices of CP and UP, and the report of UP's capabilities, etc.  The
   information model defined in this document enable defining a
   standardized data model.  Such a data model can be used to define an
   interface to the CU separation BNG.

1.  Introduction

   The rapid development of new services, such as 4K, IoT, etc, and
   increasing number of home broadband service users present some new
   challenges for BNGs such as:

      Low resource utilization: The traditional BNG acts as both a
      gateway for user access authentication and accounting and an IP
      network's Layer 3 edge.  The mutually affecting nature of the
      tightly coupled control and forwarding planes makes it difficult
      to achieve the maximum performance of either plane.

      Complex management and maintenance: Due to the large number of
      traditional BNGs, a network must have each device configured one
      at a time when deploying global service policies.  As the network
      expands and new services are introduced, this deployment mode will
      cease to be feasible as it is unable to manage services
      effectively and rectify faults rapidly.

      Slow service provisioning: The coupling of control planes and data
      planes, in addition to a distributed network control mechanism,
      means that any new technology has to rely heavily on the existing
      network devices.

   To address these challenges, cloud-based BNG with C/U separated
   conception is raised [draft-gu-nfvrg-cloud-bng-architecture-00].  The
   main idea of Control-Plane and User-Plane separation method is to
   extract and centralize the user management functions of multiple BNG
   devices, forming an unified and centralized control plane (CP).  And
   the traditional router's Control Plane and forwarding plane are both
   preserved on BNG devices in the form of a user plane (UP).

   This document describes the information model for the interface
   between Control-Plane and User-Plane separation BNG.  This
   information model may involve both control channel interface and
   configuration channel interface.  The interface for control channel
   allows the Control-Plane to send the user's information table to the
   User-Plane, and the User-Plane to report the statistics information
   to the Control-Plane, etc.  The interface for configuration channel
   is in charge of the version negotiation between the CP and UP, the
   configuration for the devices of CP and UP, and the report of UP's
   capabilities, etc.  The information model defined in this document
   enable defining a standardized data model.  Such a data model can be
   used to define an interface to the CU separation BNG.

2.  Concept and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Terminology

   BNG: Broadband Network Gateway.  A broadband remote access server
   (BRAS, B-RAS or BBRAS) routes traffic to and from broadband remote
   access devices such as digital subscriber line access multiplexers
   (DSLAM) on an Internet service provider's (ISP) network.  BRAS can
   also be referred to as a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG).

   CP: Control Plane.  The CP is a user control management component
   which support to manage UP's resources such as the user entry and
   forwarding policy

   UP: User Plane.  UP is a network edge and user policy implementation
   component.

3.  Generic Control Plane and User Plane separation BNG Overview

   Briefly, a C/U separated BNG is made up of a CP and a UP.  The CP is
   a user control management component which support to manage UP's
   resources such as the user entry and forwarding policy, for example,
   the access bandwidth and priority management.  And the UP is a
   network edge and user policy implementation component.  It can
   support the forwarding plane functions on traditional BNG devices,
   such as traffic forwarding, QoS, and traffic statistics collection,
   and it can also support the control plane functions on traditional
   BNG devices, such as routing, multicast, etc.

   In CP's view, the UP provides the control management network
   resources such as user's formation, access bandwidth, etc.  The CP
   manages these resources and according to specific service's
   requirements to generate several tables which contains a set of
   rules.  And then CP sends these tables to UP.

   In UP's view, the CP generates tables and provides the rules.  The UP
   receives these tables, parses it, matches these rules, and then
   performs corresponding actions.

4.  Information Model

   This section describes information model that represents the concept
   of the interface of CU separation BNG which is language and protocol
   neutral.

4.2.  Information Model for User Plane

   This section describes information model for the interface of User-
   Plane (UP).  As mentioned in section 3, the CP is a network edge and
   user policy implementation component.  It supports: Forwarding plane
   functions on traditional BNG devices, including traffic forwarding,
   QoS, and traffic statistics collection Control plane functions on
   traditional BNG devices, including routing, multicast, and MPLS.

   In CU separation BNG information model, the CP generates tables and
   provides the rules.  The UP plays two roles:

   1.  It receives these tables, parses it, and matches these rules,
       then performs corresponding actions.

   2.  It reports the resources and statistical information to CP.

4.2.1.  User Related Information

4.2.1.1.  User Information Model

   The User information may contains a set of User's information.  In CU
   separation BNG information model, the CP generates and sends this
   Information table to UP.  The UP parses this table, matches
   corresponding rules, and then performs next step of actions.

   The Figure below illustrates the User Information Table of User-
   Plane:
