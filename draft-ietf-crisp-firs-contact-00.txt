  1.      Introduction 
     This specification defines the naming syntax, object classes, 
     attributes, matching filters, and query processing rules for 
     storing and locating contact persons in the FIRS service. Refer to 
     [FIRS-ARCH] for information on the FIRS architecture and 
     [FIRS-CORE] for the schema definitions and rules which govern the 
     FIRS service as a whole. 
      
     The definitions in this specification are intended to be used with 
     FIRS. Their usage outside of FIRS is not prohibited, but any such 
     usage is beyond this specification's scope of authority. 
      
  2.      Prerequisites and Terminology 
     The complete set of specifications in the FIRS collection 
     cumulative define a structured and distributed information service 
     using LDAPv3 for the data-formatting and transport functions. This 
     specification should be read in the context of the complete set of 
     specifications, which currently include the following:

     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
     in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. 
      
  3.      Naming Syntax 
     The naming syntax for contact entries in FIRS MUST follow the form 
     of "cn=<inetContactSyntax>,cn=inetResources,<partition>", where 
     <inetContactSyntax > is an email address representing a contact 
     resource, and where <partition> is a sequence of domainComponent 
     relative distinguished names which identifies the scope of 
     authority for the selected directory partition. 
      
     The inetContactSyntax is unstructured, in that it uses 
     standardized procedures to produce heavily-normalized email 
     addresses rather than using structured syntax rules. The principle 
     reason for this is due to conflicting syntax rules in different 
     canonical email addressing rules, with these rules preventing the 
     use of a common syntax. 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003             [page 3] 
  Internet Draft   draft-ietf-crisp-firs-contact-00.txt        May 2003 
   
   
      
     The normalization procedure produces UTF-8 email addresses as 
     output, with these domain names being suitable for direct 
     comparisons, substring searches, and other lightweight 
     comparisons. Servers tend to be more heavily-loaded than clients, 
     and requiring the data to be normalized before it is used for 
     comparison operations ensures that a broader range of comparison 
     operations can be performed with minimal impact on those servers. 
      
     This normalization procedure is as follows: 
      
        a.  Email addresses MUST contain three elements, which are a 
            localpart element, an "at" sign ("@") separator character, 
            and a domain element. 
      
        b.  The localpart element is currently unspecified, pending 
            ongoing effort to internationalize this element. Subsequent 
            versions of this specification may define specific handling 
            rules for this element. 
      
        c.  The domain element MUST be normalized according to the 
            inetDnsDomainSyntax procedure defined in [FIRS-DNS]. 
      
     Once all of these steps have successfully completed, the email 
     address can be stored in the directory or used as an assertion 
     value. Any fatal error conditions encountered during these 
     conversions MUST result in a local failure; FIRS-aware 
     applications MUST NOT store or transmit non-normalized email 
     addresses for any purposes. 
      
     The inetContactSyntax syntax is as follows: 
      
          inetContactSyntax 
          ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.7161.1.7.1 NAME 'inetContactSyntax' DESC 'A 
            fully-qualified email address.' ) 
      
     Note that the use of the "at" separator character is illegal as 
     data in URLs, and these characters will be escaped before they are 
     stored in a URL as data. 
      
  4.      Object Classes and Attributes 
     Contact entries in FIRS MUST use the inetOrgPerson object class as 
     defined in RFC 2798 [RFC2798], in addition to the mandatory object 
     classes defined in [FIRS-CORE]. Contact entries MUST be treated as 
     containers capable of holding subordinate entries. If an entry 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003             [page 4] 
  Internet Draft   draft-ietf-crisp-firs-contact-00.txt        May 2003 
   
   
     exists as a referral source, the entry MUST also be defined with 
     the referral object class, in addition to the above requirements. 
      
     The inetOrgPerson object class is a structural object class. The 
     inetOrgPerson object class has three mandatory attributes (cn, sn, 
     and objectClass), and has several optional attributes. Contact 
     entries also inherit the attributes defined in the inetResources 
     object class when they are used with FIRS. 
      
     Refer to [RFC2798] for the inetOrgPerson schema definitions. 
      
     Note that the "mail" attribute is restricted to seven-bit 
     character codes, and is therefore not directly compatible with the 
     inetContactSyntax rules defined in section 3. That attribute MUST 
     use legacy-compatible encoding rules. 
      
     An example of the inetOrgPerson object class in use is shown in 
     Figure 1 below. The example includes attributes from the 
     inetOrgPerson, inetResources, and inetAssociatedResources object 
     classes.

     dc=netsol,dc=com partition. 
      
  5.      Query Processing Rules 
      
     Queries for contact entries have several special requirements, as 
     discussed in the following sections. 
      
     Refer to [FIRS-CORE] for general information about FIRS queries. 
      
  5.1.    Query Pre-Processing 
     Clients MUST ensure that the query input is normalized according 
     to the rules specified in section 3 before the input is used as 
     the assertion value to the resulting LDAP query. 
      
     The authoritative partition for a contact entry is determined by 
     mapping the domain element of a normalized email address to a 
     sequence of domainComponent labels. 
      
     Since the domainComponent attribute is restricted to seven-bit 
     characters, the domain element MUST be converted to its IDNA form 
     using the "ToASCII" conversion operation specified in [RFC3490], 
     with the "UseSTD3ASCIIRules" flag disabled (FIRS applications MAY 
     reuse the output from the conversion performed in step 3.c if the 
     entire conversion process is known to have completed 
     successfully). The resulting sequence of ASCII labels are used to 
     form the domainComponent sequence which represents the 
     authoritative partition for the email address. 
      
     As a simple example, "admins@example.com" would be mapped to the 
     "dc=example,dc=com" authoritative partition, with this partition 
     being used to seed the query process. 
      
  5.2.    Query Bootstrapping 
     FIRS clients MUST use the bottom-up bootstrap model by default for 
     contact queries. As such, the search base for default queries 
     would be set to the complete sequence of domainComponent relative 
     distinguished names of the authoritative partition. 
      
     FIRS clients MAY use the targeted or top-down bootstrap models for 
     queries if necessary or desirable. However, it is not likely that 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003             [page 6] 
  Internet Draft   draft-ietf-crisp-firs-contact-00.txt        May 2003 
   
   
     entries will be found for all possible contacts using these models 
     (the "dc=com" partition is not likely to have entries for all of 
     the possible contacts with mailboxes in the "com" hierarchy, for 
     example). As such, the bottom-up bootstrap model will be the most 
     useful in most cases, and MUST be used by default. 
      
     Note that registration bodies can allocate email addresses within 
     their own managed portion of the DNS namespace if predictability 
     is at a premium. For example, a registrar could assign 
     "user@registrar.com" email addresses to the contact entries that 
     it creates, thereby ensuring that the contact entries are always 
     locatable and managed. 
      
  5.3.    LDAP Matching 
     FIRS clients MUST specify equalityMatch matching filters in LDAP 
     searches for contact entries. 
      
     In order to ensure that all of the relevant entries are found 
     (including any referrals), the search filters for these resources 
     MUST specify the inetOrgPerson object class and the naming element 
     of the resource as a distinguished name attribute. For example, 
     "(&(objectclass=inetOrgPerson)(cn:dn:admins@example.com))" with a 
     search base of "cn=inetResources,dc=netsol,dc=com" would find all 
     of the inetOrgPerson object class entries with a relative 
     distinguished name of "cn=admins@example.com" in the 
     "dc=netsol,dc=com" partition. 
      
     The matching filters defined in this specification MUST be 
     supported by FIRS clients and servers. FIRS servers MAY support 
     additional sub-string filters, soundex filters, or any other 
     filters they wish (these may be required to support generic LDAP 
     clients), although FIRS clients MUST NOT expect any additional 
     filters to be available. 
      
  5.4.    Example Query 
     The following example assumes that the user has specified 
     "admins@example.com" as the query value: 
      
        a.  Normalize the input, which is "admins@example.com" in this 
            case. 
      
        b.  Determine the authoritative partition, which is 
            "dc=example,dc=com" in this case. By default, queries for 
   
  Hall                  I-D Expires: December 2003             [page 7] 
  Internet Draft   draft-ietf-crisp-firs-contact-00.txt        May 2003 
   
   
            contacts use the bottom-up model, meaning that the fully-
            qualified distinguished name of "dc=example,dc=com" will be 
            used. 
      
        c.  Determine the search base for the query, which will be 
            "cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com" if the defaults are 
            used. 
      
        d.  Initiate a DNS lookup for the SRV resource records 
            associated with "_ldap._tcp.example.com." For the purpose 
            of this example, assume that this lookup succeeds, with the 
            DNS response message indicating that "firs.example.com" is 
            the preferred LDAP server. 
      
        e.  Submit an LDAPv3 query to the specified server, using 
            "(&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(cn:dn:admins@example.com))" 
            as the matching filter, 
            "cn=inetResources,dc=example,dc=com" as the search base, 
            and the global query defaults defined in [FIRS-CORE]. 
      
        f.  Assume that no referrals are received. Display the answer 
            data which has been received and exit the query.

     Security considerations are discussed in [FIRS-ARCH]. 
      
  7.      IANA Considerations 
     IANA considerations are discussed in [FIRS-ARCH].

     Funding for the RFC editor function is currently provided by the 
     Internet Society. 
      
     Portions of this document were funded by Verisign Labs. 
      
     The first version of this specification was co-authored by Andrew 
     Newton of Verisign Labs, and subsequent versions continue to be 
     developed with his active participation. 
      
  11.     Changes from Previous Versions 
     draft-ietf-crisp-fir-contact-00: 
      
        *   Restructured the document set. 
      
        *   "Attribute references" have been eliminated from the 
            specification. All referential attributes now provide 
            actual data instead of URL pointers to data. Clients that 
            wish to retrieve these values will need to start new 
            queries using the data values instead of URLs. 
      
     draft-ietf-crisp-lw-user-01: 
      
        *   Removed references to LDAPS (LDAP-over-SSL), which is not a 
            standards-track protocol. 
      
        *   Added a discussion on localization considerations. 
      
        *   Moved attribute-specific security requirements to the 
            Security section.
