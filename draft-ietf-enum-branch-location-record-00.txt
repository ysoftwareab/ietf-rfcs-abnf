Abstract

   This documents defines the ENUM Branch Location record (EBL) which is
   used to indicate where the ENUM tree for special ENUM application is
   located.  The primary application for the EBL record is to provide a
   temporary solution for the infrastructure ENUM tree location.

Internet-Draft         ENUM Branch Location Record           August 2006


1.  Introduction

   ENUM as defined in RFC3761 [1] (User-ENUM) is not well suited for the
   purpose of interconnection by carriers, as can be seen by the use of
   various private tree arrangements based on ENUM mechanisms.

   Using the same E.164 number to domain mapping technique for other
   application under a different apex (instead of e164.arpa) is
   straightforward on the technical side.  Establishing the
   international agreements necessary to delegate the country-code level
   subdomains under the new apex is non-trivial and time-consuming.
   This process is under way [5].

   ENUM Branch Location records as defined by this document can be used
   to quickly introduce new ENUM trees on a per-country opt-in basis by
   storing the location and layout of new trees in the User-ENUM tree.

   While Infrastructure ENUM is the motivation for the introduction of
   the EBL record, its use it not limited to Infrastructure ENUM.

   More information and motivation can be found in
   draft-ietf-enum-infrastructure-enum-reqs [3] and
   draft-haberler-carrier-enum [4].

2.  ENUM Tree Referrals

   To allow maximum flexibility, the following parameters will be used
   in ENUM tree referrals.

   Application

      indicating to what kind of application this EBL applies to.  In
      the case of Infrastructure ENUM, this will be "infrastructure".

   Separator

      indicating what label should be inserted into the ENUM domain to
      branch off to the application-specific tree.  This can be an empty
      (zero-length) string which means that no label will be inserted.

   Position

      indicating at what place this label should be inserted into the
      ENUM domain to branch off to the application-specific tree.  A
      value of 0 means to the right of all digits.

   Apex

      indicating what domain should replace "e164.arpa" as the apex for
      this application.

   The "application" acts as the selector and is stored as the label in
   the DNS.  The other three parameters make up the content of the EBL.

3.  The EBL Resource Record

   The EBL will reside within the country-code level in the User-ENUM
   tree under e164.arpa.

   The RR type code for the EBL RR is /IANA-ACTION/.

3.1  The EBL RDATA Format

   The RDATA for a EBL RR consists of a position number, separator
   string and an apex domain. <character-string> and <domain-name> refer
   to the definitions of RFC 1035 [2].

   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
   |       POSITION        |
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
   /       SEPARATOR       /
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
   /         APEX          /
   +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

   where POSITION is a single byte, SEPARATOR is a <character-string>
   and APEX is a <domain-name>.  Name-compression is not to be used for
   the APEX field.

3.2  The EBL Presentation Format

   The master file format follows the standard rules in RFC 1035.
   POSITION is represented as decimal integer.  SEPARATOR is a quoted
   string, APEX is a domain name and thus does not require quoting.

4.  Examples


   infrastructure.3.4.e164.arpa.    IN EBL 2 "i" e164.arpa.
   infrastructure.1.e164.arpa.      IN EBL 4 "i" example.com.
   infrastructure.9.4.e164.arpa.    IN EBL 0 ""  ie164.arpa.

   These records indicate how the transformation from E.164 number to

   ENUM domains for the application "infrastructure" should be done for
   numbers in country code +43, +1, and +49.  This leads to the
   following mappings:

   +43 15056416            6.1.4.6.5.0.5.1.i.3.4.e164.arpa
   +1 5551234567           7.6.5.4.3.2.1.i.5.5.5.1.example.com
   +49 891234567           7.6.5.4.3.2.1.9.8.9.4.ie164.arpa


5.  Security Considerations

   EBLs are used to direct the ENUM resolvers to other places in the DNS
   for certain applications.  As these EBLs are stored in the User-ENUM
   tree, these applications therefore depend on the security of the
   User-ENUM tree.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This documents allocates the Resource Records Type field for the EBL
   record.
