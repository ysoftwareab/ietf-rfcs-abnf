Abstract

   This document describes the SMTP option for Email related
   configuration information in Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for
   IPv6 (DHCPv6).  The purpose of the DHCPv6 option for Simple Mail
   Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Server addresses is to route SMTP messages
   throughout the Internet to a mail server.

Internet-Draft           SMTP Option for DHCPv6            December 2004


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the SMTP option for email related
   configuration information in Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for
   IPv6 [RFC3315].  There is already a SMTP option available in Dynamic
   Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 [RFC2132] but since the
   structure of protocol options for DHCPv6 differs from those used in
   DHCPv4 there is a need for defining a new SMTP option in DHCPv6.

2.  Requirements notation & Naming Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCPv6 as defined
   in "Terminology" section of the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315].

4.   The Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) Server Option

   The Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) Server Option provides a
   list of one or more IPv6 addresses of SMTP [RFC2821] servers
   available to the clients for routing SMTP messages throughout the
   Internet to a mail server.  The SMTP servers SHOULD be listed in the
   order of preference.  The format of the SMTP Protocol Servers option
   is shown in Figure 1.

                     Figure 1: OPTION_SMTP_SERVERS

   option-code: OPTION_SMTP_SERVERS (tbd).

   option-len: Length of the 'SMTP server' fields in octets, it must be
      a multiple of 16.

   SMTP address: IPv6 address of SMTP server.


5.  Appearance of these options

   The SMTP server option MUST NOT appear in other than the following
   messages: Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind,
   Information-Request and Reply.  The option number for these options
   MAY appear in the Option Request Option [RFC3315] in the following
   messages: Solicit, Request, Renew, Rebind, Information-Request and
   Reconfigure.

6.  Security Considerations

   The SMTP server option may be used by an intruder DHCPv6 server to
   cause DHCPv6 clients to contact a rogue SMTP server, resulting in
   failure of email sending or in the worst case the intruder may gain
   access to the content of the email.  Also an intruder SMTP server may
   get the login name and password of the clients which attempt to
   contact the roque servers.

   To avoid attacks through these options, the DHCPv6 client SHOULD use
   authenticated DHCPv6 (see "Authentication of DHCP messages" section

   in the DHCPv6 specification [RFC3315]).

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to the following options
   from the option-code space defined in "DHCPv6 Options" section of the
   DHCPv6 specification Option Name Value Described in [RFC3315].

   OPTION_SMTP_SERVERS option code to be assigned by IANA.
