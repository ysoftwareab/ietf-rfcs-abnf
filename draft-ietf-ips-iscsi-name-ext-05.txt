1.   Introduction 
    
   This document discusses the motivation for adding an NAA type 
   format as an iSCSI node name format and defines this format in 
   accordance with the iSCSI naming conventions [RFC3720]. Defining 
   this format will enable SCSI storage devices containing both 
   iSCSI ports and SAS ports to use the same NAA-based SCSI device 
   name. 
 
    
2.   Background 
    
   To date, there are a number of networked transports providing 
   port abstractions to the SCSI protocol.  These transports all 
   incorporate some form of world-wide unique name construction 
   format.  The following table summarizes the current protocols and 
   their name formats.

   The INCITS T11 Framing and Signaling Specification [FC-FS] 
   defines a format called the Network Address Authority (NAA) 
   format for constructing worldwide unique identifiers using 
   various identifier registration authorities.  This identifier 
   format is used by the Fibre Channel and SAS SCSI transport 
   protocols.  Since most existing networked SCSI ports today are 
   either FC or SAS, the NAA format is the most commonly used 
   identifier format for SCSI transports. 
     
3.   Motivation 
    
   If iSCSI included a naming format that allowed direct 
   representation of a NAA-format name, it would facilitate 
   construction of a target device name that translates easily 
   across multiple namespaces for a SCSI storage device containing 
   ports served by different transports. 
    
   This document defines an NAA type iSCSI naming format so that one 
   NAA identifier can be assigned as the basis for the SCSI device 
   name for a SCSI target with both SAS ports and iSCSI ports. 
    
   INCITS T10 SCSI has defined a string format SCSI target device 
   name in [SPC3] that is reported in the VPD page 83 device 
   identifier page.  [SAM3] specifies that a SCSI device shall have 
   no more than one (i.e., zero or one) SCSI device name in the SCSI 
   name string format regardless of the number of SCSI transport 
   protocols supported by the SCSI device. Addition of the INCITS 
   T11-defined NAA format as a defined type for iSCSI device names 
   would make the iSCSI device naming format more consistent across 
   all current SCSI networked transports which define an NAA format 
   SCSI device name, facilitating the creation of SCSI device names 
   that are transport-independent.  This would also contribute to 
   the creation of LU names based on this SCSI device name.

4.   iSCSI NAA Name Structure  
    
   This document defines an additional iSCSI name type: 
    
     type "naa." - the remainder of the string is an INCITS T11 
                  defined Network Address Authority identifier in 
                  ASCII-encoded hexadecimal.  
    
4.1     Type "naa." - Network Address Authority 
    
   [FC-FS] defines a format for constructing globally unique 
   identifiers referred to as the Network Address Authority (NAA) 
   format. 
     
   The iSCSI NAA name format is "naa." followed by an NAA identifier 
   represented in ASCII-encoded hexadecimal digits. 
    
      Example iSCSI name with a 64-bit NAA value:  

         Type  NAA identifier (ASCII-encoded hexadecimal) 
         +--++--------------+  
         |  ||              |  

         naa.52004567BA64678D  

      Example iSCSI name with a 128-bit NAA value:  

         Type  NAA identifier (ASCII-encoded hexadecimal) 
         +--++------------------------------+  
         |  ||                              |  

         naa.62004567BA64678D0123456789ABCDEF  

   The iSCSI NAA name format might be used in an implementation 
   where the infrastructure for generating NAA worldwide unique 
   names is already in place because the device contains both SAS 
   and iSCSI SCSI ports. 
    
   The NAA name formatted in an ASCII-hexadecimal representation has 
   a maximum size of 32 characters (128 bit NAA format) - as a 
   result there is no issue with this name format exceeding the 
   maximum size for iSCSI node names.
