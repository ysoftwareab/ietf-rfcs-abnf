Abstract

   The Network Security Functions (NSF) Capability interface exists
   between the Service Provider's management system (or Security
   Controller) and the NSFs to enforce the rule provisioning and
   monitoring on the NSFs in the functional implementation level.This
   document focuses on the monitoring part of it and proposes the
   information model for it.

1.  Introduction

   According to [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-framework], the interface provided by a
   NSF (e.g., FW, IPS, Anti-DDOS, or Anti-Virus) to administrative
   entities (e.g., NMS, security controller) for configuring security
   function in the NSF and monitoring the NSF is referred to as a
   'capability interface'.  The monitoring part of the capability
   interface is meant to monitor the NSF e.g. events, logs, alarms,
   operational state of the NSF.  The monitoring of the NSF plays a very
   important role in the overall security framework if done in a timely
   and comprehensive way.  The event generated by a NSF could very well
   be an early indication of malicious activity or anomalous behavior.
   The operational state of an NSF could also be a potential sign of
   denial of service attacks or window into signature of an attack.
   This draft proposes a comprehensive NSF monitoring informational
   model that provide visibility into NSFs.  This document will not go
   into the design details of capability interface.  Instead, this draft
   is focused on specifying the information that a NSF needs to provide
   in the monitoring part of the capability interface, as well as its
   information model.  Besides, [I-D.draft-xia-i2nsf-capability-
   interface-im] specifies the information model for the rule
   provisioning part of the capability interface.

2.2.  Definition of Terms

   This document uses the terms defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-i2nsf-
   terminology].

3.  Use cases for NSF monitoring data

   As mentioned earlier, monitoring plays a very critical role in the
   overall security framework.  The monitoring of the NSF provides very
   valuable information to the security controller in maintaining the
   provisioned security posture.  Besides this, there are various other
   reasons to monitor the NSFs as listed below:

   o  The security administrator could configure a policy that is
      triggered on a specific event.  The security controller would
      monitor for the specified event and once it happens, it configures
      additional security functions as per the policy.

   o  The events triggered by NSFs as a result of security policy
      violation could be used by SIEM to detect any suspicious activity.

   o  The events and activity logs from NSFs could be used to build
      advanced analytics such as behavior and predictive to improve the
      security posture.

   o  The security controller could use events from the NSF for
      achieving high availability.  It could take corrective actions
      such as restarting a failed NSF, horizontally scaling the NSF
      etcetra.

   o  The events and activity logs from the NSF could aid in debugging
      and root cause analysis of an operational issue.

   o  The activity logs from the NSF could be used to build historical
      data for operational and business reasons.

4.  Classification of NSF monitoring data

   In order to maintain a strong security posture, it is not only
   necessary to configure security policies on NSF but also requires
   constantly monitoring NSFs for events and comprehensive logs.  This
   gives ability to security admins regarding what is happening in the
   network in realtime.  It is not possible to block all the internal
   and external threats based on static security posture but requires a
   very dynamic posture with constant visibility.  This draft proposes a
   set of monitoring data needed for this purpose as listed below:

Internet-Draft            IM for NSF Monitoring           September 2016


   o  System Alarms: This represents a set related to operational state
      of the NSF.  For example, the NSF could generate an alarm if NSF
      experience an operational issue such as link failure and system
      component failure or performance degradation.  The operator could
      configure the NSF with certain threshold and when those thresholds
      are crossed, NSF would generate an alarm.  The alarms usually
      require immediate attention from the operator otherwise network
      may go into unknown state and potentially exposing security
      vulnerabilities.  The set should only be used for sending critical
      information to avoid operator constantly combing through large
      amount of information.

   o  System Events: This represents a set of operational and
      informational data from the NSF.  For example, the NSF could
      generate an event when a policy violation occurs in the NSF or
      configuration change results into some issue.  This kind of
      information may not require an immediate attention from the
      security admin but may be useful for visibility and security
      analytics.  Some vendors combine events and alarm into one
      category.

   o  System Logs: This represents information generated by NSF systems
      such as access and authorization activity logs, configuration
      change logs and any other logs generated by NSFs.  These logs are
      important for debugging, auditing and security analytics.

   o  System counters: This represents set of counters generated by NSF
      such as network interface counters (packets, bytes), drop, error
      counters etc.  These counters are useful in debugging and
      visibility into operational behavior of the NSF.

   o  NSF Events: This represents events generated by a NSF for a
      specific functionality such as generating event when IPS detects
      attack signatures.

   o  NSF Logs: This represents logs generated by a NSF for a specific
      functionality e.g.  NAC device generating logs when it
      authenticate a user session and the associated authorization
      assigned to that user.  Another example would be when a stateful
      firewall generates log for each state created in the NSF and any
      operation assigned such as traffic shaping or marking.  These logs
      provide window into the control and data path activities of a NSF.

   o  NSF Counters: This represents counters kept by NSF for a specific
      functionality e.g. policy hits etc.

5.  Structure of NSF monitoring data

   As explained in the above section, there is a wealth of data
   available from the NSF that can be monitored.  Some of this data
   generated by NSF is structured such as alarm and other may be
   unstructured or structure may be very specific to that NSF.  This
   draft proposes common information model that is valid for the
   monitoring data and extended information model for structured data.
   The following guidelines can be used to classify monitoring data as
   structured or unstructured:

   o  System Alarms: This is structured data.  The draft proposes an
      extended information model for this.

   o  System Events: This is structured data.  The draft proposes an
      extended information model for this.

   o  System Logs: This is unstructured data.  The draft proposes a
      basic information model for this.

   o  System Counters: This is structured data.  The draft proposes an
      extended information model for this.

   o  NSF Events: This is structured and structured data.  The draft
      proposes an extended information model for this.

   o  NSF Logs: This may have structured and unstructured data.  The
      draft proposes an basic information model for this.

   o  NSF Counters: This is structured data.  The draft proposes an
      extended information model for this.

6.  Exporting NSF monitoring data

   As per the use cases of NSF monitoring data, the data need to be sent
   to various consumers based on the needs and requirements.  There are
   multiple things to be considered for exporting this data to needed
   parties as listed below:

   o  Pull-Push model: A set of data could be pushed by a NSF to the
      needed party or pulled by the needed party from a NSF.  A specific
      data might need both the models at the same time if there are
      multiple consumers with varying requirements.  It really depends
      upon the need and its usages to the consumer.  In general, any
      alarm is considered to be of great importance and must be sent
      immediately for any meaningful action so it should be sent using
      push model but logs are not as critical so could be pulled by the

      consumer.  The I2NSF does not mandate a specific scheme for each
      data set, it is up to each implementation.

   o  Export frequency: The monitoring data could be sent immediately
      upon generation by a NSF to interested parties or pushed
      periodically.  The frequency of exporting the data depends upon
      its size and timely usefulness.  It is out of the scope of I2NSF
      and left to each NSF implementation.

   o  Authentication: There may be a need for authentication between
      monitoring data producer (NSF) and consumer to ensure that
      critical information does not fall into wrong hands.  This may be
      necessary if the NSF directly export data to the consumer outside
      its admin boundary.  The I2NSF does not mandate when and how
      specific authentication must be done.

   o  Subscription method: In order for the consumer to pull the data
      from NSF or for NSF to push the data to a consumer, there must be
      a mechanism for consumer to subscribe to the NSF data it is
      interested in.  There are few open source method available and it
      is up to each implementation to decide the right one.

   o  Data transfer mode: The data could be pushed by NSF using a
      connection-less model that does require a persistent connection or
      streamed over a persistent connection.  It depends upon the
      requirement of the consumer and the nature of data.  A particular
      set of data can use either or both the mode based on
      implementation.

   o  Transport method: There are lot of transport mechanism such as IP,
      UDP, TCP.  There are also open source implementations for specific
      set of data such as systems counter.  The I2NSF does not mandate
      any specific method for a given data set, it is up to each
      implementation.

7.  Basic Information model for all monitoring data

   There is must be some general information with each message sent from
   a NSF that helps consumer in identifying meta data with that message.

   o  message_version: Indicate the version of the data format and is a
      two-digit decimal numeral starting from 01

   o  message_type: Alarm, periodical report, etc

   o  time_stamp: Indicate the time when the message is generated

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

10.  Security Considerations

   The monitoring information of NSF should be protected by the secure
   communication channel, to ensure its confidentiality and integrity.
   In another side, the NSF and security controller can all be faked,
   which lead to undesireable results, i.e., leakage of NSF's important
   operational information, faked NSF sending false information to
   mislead security controller.  The mutual authentication is essential
   to protected against this kind of attack.  The current mainstream
   security technologies (i.e., TLS, DTLS, IPSEC, X.509 PKI) can be
   employed approriately to provide the above security functions.

   In addition, to defend against the DDoS attack caused by a lot of
   NSFs sending massive monitoring information to the security
   controller, the rate limiting or similar mechanisms should be
   considered in NSF and security controller, whether in advance or just
   in the process of DDoS attack.
