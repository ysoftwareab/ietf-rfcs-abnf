1.  Introduction

   In packet switched networks when a host seeks to transmit a sizable
   amount of data to a target destination the data is transmitted as a
   set of datagrams.  In most cases it is more efficient to use the
   largest possible datagrams but so that these datagrams do not have to
   be fragmented at any point along the path from the host to the
   destination in order to avoid performance degradation caused by
   fragmentation.  Fragmentation occurs on hops along the route where an
   Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) is smaller than the size of the
   datagram.  To avoid such fragmentation the MTU for each hop along a
   path from a host to a destination must be known to select an
   appropriate datagram size.  Such MTU determination along a specific
   path is referred to as path MTU discovery (PMTUD).

   [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] introduces and explains Bit Index
   Explicit Replication (BIER) architecture and how it supports
   forwarding of multicast data packets.  A BIER domain consists of Bit-
   Forwarding Routers (BFRs) that are uniquely identified by their
   respective BFR-ids.  An ingress border router (acting as a Bit
   Forwarding Ingress Router (BFIR)) inserts a Forwarding Bit Mask
   (F-BM) into a packet.  Each targeted egress node (referred to as a
   Bit Forwarding Egress Router (BFER)) is represented by Bit Mask
   Position (BMP) in the BMS.  A transit or intermediate BIER node,
   referred as BFR, forwards BIER encapsulated packets to BFERs,
   identified by respective BMPs, according to a Bit Index Forwarding
   Table (BIFT).

2.  Problem Statement

   [I-D.ietf-bier-oam-requirements] sets forth the requirement to define
   PMTUD protocol for BIER domain.  This document describes the
   extension to [I-D.kumarzheng-bier-ping] for use in BIER PMTUD
   solution.

   Current PMTUD mechanisms [RFC1191], [RFC1981], and [RFC4821] are
   primarily targeted to work on point-to-point, i.e. unicast paths.
   These mechanisms use packet fragmentation control by disabling
   fragmentation of the probe packet.  As result, a transient node that
   cannot forward a probe packet that is bigger than its link MTU sends
   to the ingress node an error notification, otherwise the egress
   responds with a positive acknowledgement.  Thus, through series of
   iterations, decreasing and increasing size of the probe packet, the
   ingress node discovers the MTU of the particular path.

   Thus applied such existing PMTUD solutions are inefficient for point-
   to-multipoint paths constructed for multicast traffic.  Probe packets

   must be flooded through the whole set of multicast distribution paths
   over and over again until the very last egress responds with a
   positive acknowledgement.  Consider without loss of generality an
   example multicast network presented in Figure 1, where MTU on all
   links but one (B,D) is the same.  If MTU on link (B,D) is smaller
   than the MTU on the other links, using existing PMTUD mechanism
   probes will unnecessary flood to leaf nodes E, F, and G for the
   second and consecutive times and positive responses will be generated
   and received by root A repeatedly.

3.  PMTUD Mechanism for BIER

   A BFIR selects a set of BFERs for the specific multicast
   distribution.  Such BFIR determines, by explicitly controlling subset
   of targeted BFERs and transmitting series of probe packets, the MTU
   of that multicast distribution path.  The critical step is that in
   case of failure at an intermediate BFR to forward towards the subset
   of targeted downstream BFERs, the BFR responds with a partial
   (compared to the one it received in the request) bitmask towards the
   originating BFIR in error notification.  That allows for
   retransmission of the next probe with smaller MTU address only
   towards the failed downstream BFERs instead of all BFERs addressed in
   the previous probe.  In the scenario discussed in Section 2 the
   second and all following (if needed) probes will be sent only to the
   node D since MTU discovery of E, F, and G has been completed already
   by the first probe successfully.

   [I-D.kumarzheng-bier-ping] introduced BIER Ping as transport-
   independent OAM mechanism to detect and localize failures in BIER

   data plane.  This document specifies how BIER Ping can be used to
   perform efficient PMTUD in BIER domain.

   Consider network displayed in Figure 1 to be presentation of a BIER
   domain and all nodes to be BFRs.  To discover MTU over BIER domain to
   BFERs D, F, E, and G BFIR A will use BIER Ping with Data TLV, defined
   in Section 3.1.  Size of the first probe set to _M_max_ determined as
   minimal MTU value of BFIR's links to BIER domain.  As been assumed in
   Section 2, MTUs of all links but link (B,D) are the same.  Thus BFERs
   E.  F, and G would receive BIER Echo Request and will send their
   respective replies to BFIR A.  BFR B may pass the packet which is too
   large to forward over egress link (B, D) to the appropriate network
   layer for error processing where it would be recognized as BIER Echo
   Request packet.  BFR B MUST send BIER Echo Reply to BFIR A and MUST
   include Downstream Mapping TLV, defined in [I-D.kumarzheng-bier-ping]
   setting its fields in the following fashion:

   o  MTU SHOULD be set to minimal MTU value among all egress BIER links
      that could be used to reach B's downstream BFERs;

   o  Address Type MUST be set to 0 [Ed.note: we need to define 0 as
      valid value for the Address Type field with the specific semantics
      to "Ignore" it.]

   o  I flag MUST be cleared;

   o  Downstream Interface Address field (4 octets) MUST be zeroed and
      MUST include in Egress Bitstring sub-TLV the list of all BFERs
      that cannot be reached because the attempted MTU turned out to be
      too small.

   The BFIR will receive either of the two types of packets:

   o  a positive Echo Reply from one of BFERs to which the probe has
      been sent.  In such case the bit corresponding to the BFER MUST be
      cleared from the BMS;

   o  a negative Echo Reply with bit string listing unreached BFERs and
      recommended MTU value MTU".  The BFIR MUST add the bit string to
      its BMS and set size of the next probe as min(MTU, MTU")

   If upon expiration of the Echo Request timer BFIR didn't receive any
   Echo Replies, then the size of the probe SHOULD be decreased.  There
   are scenarios when an implementation of the PMTUD would not decrease
   the size of the probe.  For example, if upon expiration of the Echo
   Request timer BFIR didn't receive any Echo Reply, then BFIR MAY
   continue to retransmit the probe using the initial size and MAY apply
   probe delay retransmission procedures.  The algorithm used to delay

   retransmission procedures on BFIR is outside the scope of this
   specification.  The BFIR MUST continue sending probes using BMS until
   the bit string is clear or the discovery is declared unsuccessful.
   In case of convergence of the procedure, the size of the last probe
   indicates the MTU size that can be used for all BFERs in the initial
   BMS without incurring fragmentation.

   Thus we conclude that in order to comply with the requirement in
   [I-D.ietf-bier-oam-requirements]:

   o  a BFR SHOULD support PMTUD;

   o  a BFR MAY use defined per BIER sub-domain MTU value as initial MTU
      value for discovery or use it as MTU for this BIER sub-domain to
      reach BFERs.

   PMTUD.  Data TLV format is presented in Figure 2.

   o  Length: the length of the Data field in octets.

   o  Data: n octets (n = Length) of arbitrary data.  The receiver
      SHOULD ignore it.

   IANA is requested to assign new Type value for Data TLV Type from its
   registry of TLV and sub-TLV Types of BIER Ping as follows:
