Profile-type   = "profile-type" EQUAL profile-value
profile-value  = profile-types / token
profile-types  = "device" / "user" / "application" / "local-network"

      The "device", "user", "application" or "local-network" token in
      the profile-type parameter may represent a class or set of profile
      properties.  As standards are defined for specific profile
      contents related to the user, device or local network, it may be
      desirable to define additional tokens for the profile-type
      parameter.  Also additional content types may be defined along
      with the profile formats that can be used in the Accept header of
      the SUBSCRIBE to filter or indicate what data sets of the profile
      are desired.

Vendor       =  "vendor" EQUAL quoted-string
Model        =  "model" EQUAL quoted-string
Version      =  "version" EQUAL quoted-string

Network-User =  "network-user" EQUAL LDQUOT addr-spec RDQUOT

      The entity that is subscribing and getting the "device" and
      "local-network" profiles is the device.  For this reason the From
      field should indicate the device's identity.  These profiles types
      contain device specific information and it is the device's
      identity that gets authenticated for the "device" profile.
      Depending upon the local adminstration policy and segmentation of
      services, the device identity and user profile identity
      association may not be know to the the configuration delivery
      server ahead of time.  So because the From field and SUBSCRIBE
      request URI indicate the "device" profile resource identifier, the
      "network-user" parameter is needed to indicate the additional
      resource identifier for the user assocated with this device.
