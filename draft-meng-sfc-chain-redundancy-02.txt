1.  Introduction

   The object of Service Function Chains (SFC) is trying to unload
   services from nodes in traditional network and deal with such
   services through service function chains.  As a result of this,
   redundancy of service function instances needs to be standardize,
   rather than maintain as an internal mechanism in a traditional
   network device.

   Many SFs might be located in large-scale networks, such as ISP
   networks or enterprise ones, where exist a large number of customers.
   In each service function, these customers which is served by a single
   service function instance (SFI) may experience service degradation in
   case of the presence of the single point of exceptional failure.
   Therefore, redundancy of the SFI will be strongly desired in order to
   deliver highly available services.

   This memo describes some use cases of redundancy among SFIs under
   typical scenarios.

3.  Redundancy Mechanisms

   As illustrated in Figure 1, two SFIs (SFI1 and SFI1') are deployed
   for redundancy purposes.  This is the reference architecture for the
   mechanisms we describe in this memo.

   each of those master SFIs might have more than one corresponding
   backup SFIs.

4.  Redirect Service Function Paths

   As described in [ietf-sfc-architecture], a Service Function Path is
   the instantiation of the defined SFC.

   In case of planned maintenance operations or exceptional failure of
   Service Function Node, The SFP MUST be changed to prevent disrupting
   the normal traffic.
