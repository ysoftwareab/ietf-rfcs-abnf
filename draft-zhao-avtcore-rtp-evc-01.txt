          RTP Payload Format for Essential Video Coding (EVC)
                     draft-zhao-avtcore-rtp-evc-01

Abstract

   This memo describes an RTP payload format for the video coding
   standard ISO/IEC International Standard 23094-1 [ISO23094-1], also
   known as Essential Video Coding [EVC] and developed by ISO/IEC
   JTC1/SC29/WG11.  The RTP payload format allows for packetization of
   one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet
   payload as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP
   packets.  The payload format has wide applicability in
   videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate
   entertainment-quality video, among other applications.

Internet-Draft         RTP payload format for EVC             March 2020


1.  Introduction

   The [EVC] specification, which will be formally designated (once
   approved) as ISO/IEC International Standard 23094-1 [ISO23094-1], is
   planned for ratification in early 2020.  A draft that's currently in
   the approval process of ISO/IEC can be found as [EVC].  One goal of
   MPEG is to keep [EVC]'s baseline essentially royalty free by
   agreement among the key contributors, whereas more advanced profiles
   follow a reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing terms policy.
   Both baseline and higher profiles of [EVC] are reported to provide
   coding efficiency gains over [HEVC] and [AVC] under certain
   configurations.

      Editor's note: add comparison with [VVC]

   This memo describes an RTP payload format for [EVC].  It shares its
   basic design with the NAL unit-based RTP payload formats of H.264
   Video Coding [RFC6184], Scalable Video Coding (SVC) [RFC6190], High
   Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) [RFC7798], and Versatile Video Coding
   (VVC)[draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-vvc].  With respect to design
   philosophy, security, congestion control, and overall implementation
   complexity, it has similar properties to those earlier payload format
   specifications.  This is a conscious choice, as at least RFC 6184 is
   widely deployed and generally known in the relevant implementer
   communities.  Certain mechanisms known from [RFC6190] were
   incorporated as EVC supports temporal scalability.  [EVC] does not
   offer higher forms of scalability.

1.1.  Overview of the EVC Codec

   [EVC], [AVC], [HEVC] and [VVC] share a similar hybrid video codec
   design.  In this memo, we provide a very brief overview of those
   features of EVC that are, in some form, addressed by the payload
   format specified herein.  Implementers have to read, understand, and
   apply the ISO/IEC specifications pertaining to EVC to arrive at
   interoperable, well-performing implementations.  The EVC standard has
   a baseline profile and on top of that, a main profile, the latter
   including more advanced features.  A "toolset" syntax element allows
   encoders to mark a bitstream as to what of the many independent
   coding tools are exercised in the bitstream, in a spirit similar to
   the general_constraint_flags of [VVC].

   Conceptually, all [EVC], [AVC], [HEVC] and [VVC] include a Video
   Coding Layer (VCL), which is often used to refer to the coding-tool
   features, and a Network Abstraction Layer (NAL), which is often used
   to refer to the systems and transport interface aspects of the
   codecs.

Internet-Draft         RTP payload format for EVC             March 2020


1.1.1.  Coding-Tool Features (informative)

   Coding blocks and transform structure

   [EVC] uses a traditional quad-tree coding structure, which divides
   the encoded image into blocks of up to 128x128 luma samples, which
   can be recursively divided into smaller blocks.  The main profile
   adds two advanced coding structure tools: Binary Ternary Tree (BTT)
   that allows non-square coding units and segmentation that changes the
   processing order of the segmentation unit from traditional left-
   scanning order processing to right-scanning order processing Unit
   Coding Order (SUCO).  In the main profile, the picture can be divided
   into rectangular tiles, and these tiles can be independently encoded
   and/or decoded in parallel.

   When predicting a data block using intra prediction or inter
   prediction, the remaining data is usually added to the prediction
   block.  The residual data is added to the prediction block.  The
   residual data is obtained by applying an inverse quantization process
   and an inverse transform.  [EVC] includes integer discrete cosine
   transform (DCT2) and scalar quantization.  For the main profile,
   Improved Quantization and Transform (IQT) uses a different mapping/
   clipping function for quantization.  An inverse zig-zag scanning
   order is used for coefficient coding.  Advanced Coefficient Coding
   (ADCC) in the main profile can code coefficient values more
   efficiently, for example, indicated by the last non-zero coefficient.
   In main profile, Adaptive Transformation Selection (ATS) is also
   available and can be applied to integer versions of DST7 or DCT8, and
   not just DCT2.

   Entropy coding

   [EVC] uses a similar binary arithmetic coding mechanism as [AVC].
   The mechanism includes a binarization step and a probability update
   defined by a lookup table.  In the main profile, the derivation
   process of syntax elements based on adjacent blocks makes the context
   modeling and initialization process more efficient.

   In-loop filtering

   The baseline profile of [EVC] uses the deblocking filter defined in
   H.263 Annex J.  In the main profile, compared to the deblocking
   filter in the baseline profile, an Advanced Deblocking Filter (ADDB)
   can be used, which can further reduce artifacts.  The main profile
   also defines two additional in-loop filters that can be used to
   improve the quality of decoded pictures before output and/or for
   inter prediction.  A Walsh-Hadamard Transform Domain Filter (HTDF) is
   applied to the luma samples before deblocking, and the scanning

Internet-Draft         RTP payload format for EVC             March 2020


   process is used to determine 4 adjacent samples for filtering.  An
   adaptive Loop Filter (ALF) allows to send signals of up to 25
   different filters for the luma components, and the best filter can be
   selected through the classification process for each 4x4 block.  The
   filter parameters of the ALF filter are signaled in the Adaptation
   Parameter Set (APS).

   Inter-prediction

   The basis of [EVC] inter prediction is motion compensation using
   interpolation filters with a quarter sample resolution.  In baseline
   profile, a motion vector signal is transmitted using one of three
   spatially neighboring motion vectors and a temporally collocated
   motion vector as a predictor.  The motion vector difference may be
   signaled relative to the selected predictor, but for the case where
   no motion vector difference is signaled and there is no remaining
   data in the block, there is a specific mode called a skip mode.  The
   main profile includes six additional tools to provide improved inter
   prediction.  With advanced Motion Interpolation and Signaling (AMIS),
   adjacent blocks can be conceptually merged to indicate that they use
   the same motion, but more advanced schemes can also be used to create
   predictions from the basic model list of candidate predictors.  The
   Merge with Motion Vector Difference (MMVD) tool uses a process
   similar to the concept of merging neighboring blocks, but also allows
   the use of expressions that include a starting point, motion
   amplitude, and direction of motion to send a motion vector signal.

   Using Advanced Motion Vector Prediction (AMVP), candidate motion
   vector predictions for the block can be derived from its neighboring
   blocks in the same picture and collocated blocks in the reference
   picture.  The Adaptive Motion Vector Resolution (AMVR) tool provides
   a way to reduce the accuracy of a motion vector from a quarter sample
   to half sample, full sample, double sample, or quad sample, which
   provides the efficiency advantage, such as when sending large motion
   vector differences.  The main profile also includes the Decoder-side
   Motion Vector Refinement (DMVR), which uses a bilateral template
   matching process to refine the motion vectors in a bidirectional
   fashion.

   Intra prediction and intra-coding

   Intra prediction in [EVC] is performed on adjacent samples of coding
   units in a partitioned structure.  For the baseline profile, all
   coding units are square, and there are five different prediction
   modes: DC (mean value of the neighborhood), horizontal, vertical, and
   two different diagonal directions.  In the main profile, intra
   prediction can be applied to any rectangular coding unit, and there
   are 28 additional direction modes available in the so-called Enhanced

Internet-Draft         RTP payload format for EVC             March 2020


   Intra Prediction Directions (EIPD).  In the main profile, an encoder
   can also use Intra Block Copy (IBC), where a previously decoded
   sample blocks of the same picture is used as a predictor.  A
   displacement vector in integer sample precision is signaled to
   indicate where the prediction block in the current picture is used
   for this mode.

   Decoded picture buffer management

   In the previous technology, decoded pictures can be stored in a
   decoded picture buffer (Decoded Picture Buffer, DPB) for predicting
   pictures that follow them in decoding order.  In the baseline
   profile, the management of the DPB (i.e. the process of adding and
   deleting reference pictures) is controlled by the information in the
   SPS.  For the main profile, if a Reference Picture List (RPL) scheme
   is used, DPB management can be controlled by information that is
   signaled at the picture level.

1.1.2.  Systems and Transport Interfaces

   [EVC] inherited the basic systems and transport interfaces designs
   from [AVC] and [HEVC].  These include the NAL-unit-based syntax
   structure, the hierarchical syntax and data unit structure and the
   Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI) message mechanism.  The
   hierarchical syntax and data unit structure consists of a sequence-
   level parameter set (SPS), two picture-level parameter sets (PPS and
   APS, each of which can apply to one or more pictures), slice-level
   header parameters, and lower-level parameters.

   A number of key components that influenced the Network Abstraction
   Layer design of [EVC] as well as this memo are described below

   Sequence parameter set

   The Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) contains syntax elements pertaining
   to a coded video sequence (CVS), which is a group of pictures,
   starting with a random access point, and followed by pictures that
   may depend on each other and the random access point picture.  In
   MPGEG-2, the equivalent of a CVS was a Group of Pictures (GOP), which
   normally started with an I frame and was followed by P and B frames.
   While more complex in its options of random access points, EVC
   retains this basic concept.  In many TV-like applications, a CVS
   contains a few hundred milliseconds to a few seconds of video.  In
   video conferencing (without switching MCUs involved), a CVS can be as
   long in duration as the whole session.

   Picture and Adaptation parameter set

Internet-Draft         RTP payload format for EVC             March 2020


   The Picture Parameter Set and the Adaptation Parameter Set (PPS and
   APS, respectively) carry information pertaining to a single picture.
   The PPS contains information that is likely to stay constant from
   picture to picture-at least for pictures for a certain type-whereas
   the APS contains information, such as adaptive loop filter
   coefficients, that are likely to change from picture to picture.

   Profile, level and toolsets

   Profiles and levels follow the same design considerations ask known
   form [AVC], [HEVC], and in fact video codecs as old as MPEG-1 visual.
   A profile defines a set of tools (not to confuse with the "toolset"
   discussed below) that a decoder compliant with this profile has to
   support.  In [EVC], profiles are defined in Annex A.  Formally, they
   are defined as a set of constraints that a bitstream needs to conform
   to.  In [EVC], the baseline profile is much more severely constraint
   than main profile, reducing implementation complexity.  Levels relate
   to bitstream complexity in dimensions such as maximum sample decoding
   rate, maximum picture size, and similar parameters that are directly
   related to computational complexity.

   Profiles and levels are signaled in the highest parameter set
   available, the SPS.

   [EVC] contains another mechanism related to the use of coding tools,
   known as the toolset syntax element.  This syntax element, also
   located in the SPS, is a bitmask that allows encoders to indicate
   which coding tools they are using, within the menu of profiles
   offered by the profile that is also signaled.  No decoder conformance
   point is associated with the toolset, but a bitstream that were using
   a coding tool that is indicated as not used in the toolset syntax
   element would obviously be non-compliant.  While MPEG specifically
   rules out the use of the toolset syntax element as a conformance
   point, walled garden implementations could do so without incurring
   the interoperability problems MPEG fears, and create bitstreams and
   decoders that do not support one or more given tools.  That, in turn,
   may be useful to mitigate certain patent related risks.

   Bitstream and elementary stream

   Above the Coded Video Sequence (CVS), [EVC] defines a video bitstream
   that can be used in the MPEG systems context as an elementary stream.
   For the purpose of this memo, this is not relevant.

   Random access support

      Editor's note: At this point, the authors believe [EVC] supports
      only clean random access.  WG input is solicited.

   Temporal scalability support

   [EVC] includes support for temporal scalability through the
   generalized reference picture selection approach known since
   [AVC]/SVC.  Up to six temporal layers are supported.  The temporal
   layer is signaled in the NAL unit header (which co-serves as the
   payload header in this memo), in the nuh_temporal_id field.

   SEI Message

   [EVC] inherits many of [HEVC]'s SEI Messages, occasionally with
   changes in syntax and/or semantics making them applicable to EVC.

      Placeholder

1.1.4.  NAL Unit Header

   [EVC] maintains the NAL unit concept of [HEVC] with different
   parameter options.  EVC also uses a two-byte NAL unit header, as
   shown in Figure 1.  The payload of a NAL unit refers to the NAL unit
   excluding the NAL unit header.

      (avoidance of start code emulations) [MPEG2S].  In the context of
      this memo,the value 1 may be used to indicate a syntax violation,
      e.g., for a NAL unit resulted from aggregating a number of
      fragmented units of a NAL unit but missing the last fragment, as
      described in Section xxx. (section # placeholder)

   Type: 6 bits

      nal_unit_type_plus1.  This field specifies the NAL unit type as
      defined in Table 7-1 of [EVC].  If the most significant bit of
      this field of a NAL unit is equal to 0 (i.e., the value of this
      field is less than 32), the NAL unit is a VCL NAL unit.
      Otherwise, the NAL unit is a non-VCL NAL unit.  For a reference of
      all currently defined NAL unit types and their semantics, please
      refer to Section 7.3.1.2 in [EVC].

   TID: 3 bits

      nuh_temporal_id.  This field specifies the temporal identifier of
      the NAL unit plus 1.  The value of TemporalId is equal to TID
      minus 1.  A TID value of 0 is illegal to ensure that there is at
      least one bit in the NAL unit header equal to 1, so to enable
      independent considerations of start code emulations in the NAL
      unit header and in the NAL unit payload data.

   Reserve: 5 bits

      nuh_reserved_zero_5bits.  This field shall be equal to the version
      of the [EVC] specification.  Values of nuh_reserved_zero_5bits
      greater than 0 are reserved for future use by ISO/IEC.  Decoders
      conforming to a profile specified in [EVC] Annex A shall ignore
      (i.e., remove from the bitstream and discard) all NAL units with
      values of nuh_reserved_zero_5bits greater than 0.

   E: 1 bit

      nuh_extension_flag.  This field shall be equal the version of the
      [EVC] specification.  Value of nuh_extesion_flag equal to 1 is
      reserved for future use by ISO/IEC.  Decoders conforming to a
      profile specified in Annex A shall ignore (i.e., remove from the
      bitstream and discard) all NAL units with values of
      nuh_extension_flag equal to 1.

3.1.2.  Definitions Specific to This Memo

   Media-Aware Network Element (MANE): A network element, such as a
   middlebox, selective forwarding unit, or application-layer gateway
   that is capable of parsing certain aspects of the RTP payload headers
   or the RTP payload and reacting to their contents.

      Editor Notes: the following informative needs to be updated along
      with frame marking update

      Informative note: The concept of a MANE goes beyond normal routers
      or gateways in that a MANE has to be aware of the signaling (e.g.,
      to learn about the payload type mappings of the media streams),
      and in that it has to be trusted when working with Secure RTP
      (SRTP).  The advantage of using MANEs is that they allow packets
      to be dropped according to the needs of the media coding.  For
      example, if a MANE has to drop packets due to congestion on a
      certain link, it can identify and remove those packets whose
      elimination produces the least adverse effect on the user

      experience.  After dropping packets, MANEs must rewrite RTCP
      packets to match the changes to the RTP stream, as specified in
      Section 7 of [RFC3550].

   NAL unit decoding order: A NAL unit order that conforms to the
   constraints on NAL unit order given in Section 8.2 and 8.3 in [EVC],
   follow the Order of NAL units in the bitstream.

   NAL unit output order: A NAL unit order in which NAL units of
   different access units are in the output order of the decoded
   pictures corresponding to the access units, as specified in [EVC],
   and in which NAL units within an access unit are in their decoding
   order.

   RTP stream: See [RFC7656].  Within the scope of this memo, one RTP
   stream is utilized to transport one or more temporal sub-layers.

   Transmission order: The order of packets in ascending RTP sequence
   number order (in modulo arithmetic).  Within an aggregation packet,
   the NAL unit transmission order is the same as the order of
   appearance of NAL units in the packet.

4.  RTP Payload Format

4.1.  RTP Header Usage

   The format of the RTP header is specified in [RFC3550] (reprinted as
   Figure 2 for convenience).  This payload format uses the fields of
   the header in a manner consistent with that specification.

   The RTP payload (and the settings for some RTP header bits) for
   aggregation packets and fragmentation units are specified in
   Section 4.3.2 and Section 4.3.3, respectively.

                                 Figure 2

   The RTP header information to be set according to this RTP payload
   format is set as follows:

   Marker bit (M): 1 bit

      Set for the last packet of the access unit, carried in the current
      RTP stream.  This is in line with the normal use of the M bit in
      video formats to allow an efficient playout buffer handling.



         Editor notes: The informative note below needs updating once
         the NAL unit type table is stable in the [EVC] spec.



         Informative note: The content of a NAL unit does not tell
         whether or not the NAL unit is the last NAL unit, in decoding
         order, of an access unit.  An RTP sender implementation may
         obtain this information from the video encoder

   Payload Type (PT): 7 bits

      The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new payload format
      is outside the scope of this document and will not be specified
      here.  The assignment of a payload type has to be performed either
      through the profile used or in a dynamic way.

Internet-Draft         RTP payload format for EVC             March 2020


   Sequence Number (SN): 16 bits

      Set and used in accordance with [RFC3550].

   Timestamp: 32 bits

      The RTP timestamp is set to the sampling timestamp of the content.
      A 90 kHz clock rate MUST be used.  If the NAL unit has no timing
      properties of its own (e.g., parameter sets or certain SEI NAL
      units), the RTP timestamp MUST be set to the RTP timestamp of the
      coded picture of the access unit in which the NAL unit (according
      to Annex D of [EVC]) is included.  Receivers MUST use the RTP
      timestamp for the display process, even when the bitstream
      contains picture timing SEI messages or decoding unit information
      SEI messages as specified in [EVC].

   Synchronization source (SSRC): 32 bits

      Used to identify the source of the RTP packets.  When using SRST,
      by definition a single SSRC is used for all parts of a single
      bitstream.

4.2.  Payload Header Usage

   The first two bytes of the payload of an RTP packet are referred to
   as the payload header.  The payload header consists of the same
   fields (F, TID, Reserve and E) as the NAL unit header as shown in
   Section 1.1.4, irrespective of the type of the payload structure.

   The TID value indicates (among other things) the relative importance
   of an RTP packet, for example, because NAL units belonging to higher
   temporal sub-layers are not used for the decoding of lower temporal
   sub-layers.  A lower value of TID indicates a higher importance.
   More-important NAL units MAY be better protected against transmission
   losses than less-important NAL units.

4.3.  Payload Structures

   Three different types of RTP packet payload structures are specified.
   A receiver can identify the type of an RTP packet payload through the
   Type field in the payload header.

   The Three different payload structures are as follows:

   o  Single NAL unit packet: Contains a single NAL unit in the payload,
      and the NAL unit header of the NAL unit also serves as the payload
      header.  This payload structure is specified in Section 4.3.1.

Internet-Draft         RTP payload format for EVC             March 2020


   o  Aggregation Packet (AP): Contains more than one NAL unit within
      one access unit.  This payload structure is specified in
      Section 4.3.2.

   o  Fragmentation Unit (FU): Contains a subset of a single NAL unit.
      This payload structure is specified in Section 4.3.3.

4.3.1.  Single NAL Unit Packets

      Editor notes: its better to add a section to describe DONL and
      sprop-max_don_diff

   A single NAL unit packet contains exactly one NAL unit, and consists
   of a payload header (denoted as PayloadHdr), a conditional 16-bit
   DONL field (in network byte order), and the NAL unit payload data
   (the NAL unit excluding its NAL unit header) of the contained NAL
   unit, as shown in Figure 3.

                                 Figure 3

   The DONL field, when present, specifies the value of the 16 least
   significant bits of the decoding order number of the contained NAL
   unit.  If sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0 for any of the RTP
   streams, the DONL field MUST be present, and the variable DON for the
   contained NAL unit is derived as equal to the value of the DONL
   field.  Otherwise (sprop-max-don-diff is equal to 0 for all the RTP
   streams), the DONL field MUST NOT be present.

4.3.2.  Aggregation Packets (APs)

   Aggregation Packets (APs) enable the reduction of packetization
   overhead for small NAL units, such as most of the non-VCL NAL units,
   which are often only a few octets in size.

   An AP aggregates NAL units within one access unit.  Each NAL unit to
   be carried in an AP is encapsulated in an aggregation unit.  NAL
   units aggregated in one AP are in NAL unit decoding order.

   An AP consists of a payload header (denoted as PayloadHdr) followed
   by two or more aggregation units, as shown in Figure 4.

                   The Structure of an Aggregation Packet


                                 Figure 4

   The fields in the payload header are set as follows.  The F bit MUST
   be equal to 0 if the F bit of each aggregated NAL unit is equal to
   zero; otherwise, it MUST be equal to 1.  The Type field MUST be equal
   to 56.

   The value of TID MUST be the lowest value of TID of all the
   aggregated NAL units.  The value of Reserve and E Must match the
   version of [EVC] specification.

      Informative note: All VCL NAL units in an AP have the same TID
      value since they belong to the same access unit.  However, an AP
      may contain non-VCL NAL units for which the TID value in the NAL
      unit header may be different than the TID value of the VCL NAL
      units in the same AP.

   An AP MUST carry at least two aggregation units and can carry as many
   aggregation units as necessary; however, the total amount of data in
   an AP obviously MUST fit into an IP packet, and the size SHOULD be
   chosen so that the resulting IP packet is smaller than the path MTU
   size so to avoid IP layer fragmentation.  An AP MUST NOT contain FUs
   specified in Section 4.3.3.  APs MUST NOT be nested; i.e., an AP can
   not contain another AP.

   The first aggregation unit in an AP consists of a conditional 16-bit
   DONL field (in network byte order) followed by a 16-bit unsigned size
   information (in network byte order) that indicates the size of the

           The Structure of the First Aggregation Unit in an AP

                                 Figure 5

   The DONL field, when present, specifies the value of the 16 least
   significant bits of the decoding order number of the aggregated NAL
   unit.

   If sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0 for any of the RTP streams,
   the DONL field MUST be present in an aggregation unit that is the
   first aggregation unit in an AP, and the variable DON for the
   aggregated NAL unit is derived as equal to the value of the DONL
   field.  Otherwise (sprop-max-don-diff is equal to 0 for all the RTP
   streams), the DONL field MUST NOT be present in an aggregation unit
   that is the first aggregation unit in an AP.

   An aggregation unit that is not the first aggregation unit in an AP
   will be followed immediately by a 16-bit unsigned size information
   (in network byte order) that indicates the size of the NAL unit in
   bytes (excluding these two octets, but including the NAL unit
   header), followed by the NAL unit itself, including its NAL unit
   header, as shown in Figure 6.

4.3.3.  Fragmentation Units

   Fragmentation Units (FUs) are introduced to enable fragmenting a
   single NAL unit into multiple RTP packets, possibly without
   cooperation or knowledge of the EVC [EVC] encoder.  A fragment of a
   NAL unit consists of an integer number of consecutive octets of that
   NAL unit.  Fragments of the same NAL unit MUST be sent in consecutive
   order with ascending RTP sequence numbers (with no other RTP packets
   within the same RTP stream being sent between the first and last
   fragment).

   When a NAL unit is fragmented and conveyed within FUs, it is referred
   to as a fragmented NAL unit.  APs MUST NOT be fragmented.  FUs MUST
   NOT be nested; i.e., an FU must not contain a subset of another FU.

   The RTP timestamp of an RTP packet carrying an FU is set to the NALU-
   time of the fragmented NAL unit.

   An FU consists of a payload header (denoted as PayloadHdr), an FU
   header of one octet, a conditional 16-bit DONL field (in network byte
   order), and an FU payload, as shown in Figure 9.

   The fields in the payload header are set as follows.  The Type field
   MUST be equal to 57.  The fields F, TID, Reserve and E MUST be equal
   to the fields F, TID, Reserve and E, respectively, of the fragmented
   NAL unit.

   The FU header consists of an S bit, an E bit, and a 6-bit FuType
   field, as shown in Figure 10.

   The semantics of the FU header fields are as follows:

   S: 1 bit

      When set to 1, the S bit indicates the start of a fragmented NAL
      unit, i.e., the first byte of the FU payload is also the first
      byte of the payload of the fragmented NAL unit.  When the FU
      payload is not the start of the fragmented NAL unit payload, the S
      bit MUST be set to 0.

   E: 1 bit

Internet-Draft         RTP payload format for EVC             March 2020


      When set to 1, the E bit indicates the end of a fragmented NAL
      unit, i.e., the last byte of the payload is also the last byte of
      the fragmented NAL unit.  When the FU payload is not the last
      fragment of a fragmented NAL unit, the E bit MUST be set to 0.

   FuType: 6 bits

      The field FuType MUST be equal to the field Type of the fragmented
      NAL unit.

   The DONL field, when present, specifies the value of the 16 least
   significant bits of the decoding order number of the fragmented NAL
   unit.

   If sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0 for any of the RTP streams,
   and the S bit is equal to 1, the DONL field MUST be present in the
   FU, and the variable DON for the fragmented NAL unit is derived as
   equal to the value of the DONL field.  Otherwise (sprop-max-don-diff
   is equal to 0 for all the RTP streams, or the S bit is equal to 0),
   the DONL field MUST NOT be present in the FU.

   A non-fragmented NAL unit MUST NOT be transmitted in one FU; i.e.,
   the Start bit and End bit must not both be set to 1 in the same FU
   header.

   The FU payload consists of fragments of the payload of the fragmented
   NAL unit so that if the FU payloads of consecutive FUs, starting with
   an FU with the S bit equal to 1 and ending with an FU with the E bit
   equal to 1, are sequentially concatenated, the payload of the
   fragmented NAL unit can be reconstructed.  The NAL unit header of the
   fragmented NAL unit is not included as such in the FU payload, but
   rather the information of the NAL unit header of the fragmented NAL
   unit is conveyed in F, TID, Reserve and E fields of the FU payload
   headers of the FUs and the FuType field of the FU header of the FUs.
   An FU payload MUST NOT be empty.

   If an FU is lost, the receiver SHOULD discard all following
   fragmentation units in transmission order corresponding to the same
   fragmented NAL unit, unless the decoder in the receiver is known to
   gracefully handle incomplete NAL units.

   A receiver in an endpoint or in a MANE MAY aggregate the first n-1
   fragments of a NAL unit to an (incomplete) NAL unit, even if fragment
   n of that NAL unit is not received.  In this case, the
   forbidden_zero_bit of the NAL unit MUST be set to 1 to indicate a
   syntax violation.

4.4.  Decoding Order Number

   For each NAL unit, the variable AbsDon is derived, representing the
   decoding order number that is indicative of the NAL unit decoding
   order.

   Let NAL unit n be the n-th NAL unit in transmission order within an
   RTP stream.

   If sprop-max-don-diff is equal to 0 for all the RTP streams carrying
   the HEVC bitstream, AbsDon[n], the value of AbsDon for NAL unit n, is
   derived as equal to n.

   Otherwise (sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0 for any of the RTP
   streams), AbsDon[n] is derived as follows, where DON[n] is the value
   of the variable DON for NAL unit n:

   o  If n is equal to 0 (i.e., NAL unit n is the very first NAL unit in
      transmission order), AbsDon[0] is set equal to DON[0].

   o  Otherwise (n is greater than 0), the following applies for
      derivation of AbsDon[n]:

         If DON[n] == DON[n-1],
            AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1]

         If (DON[n] > DON[n-1] and DON[n] - DON[n-1] < 32768),
            AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1] + DON[n] - DON[n-1]

         If (DON[n] < DON[n-1] and DON[n-1] - DON[n] >= 32768),
            AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1] + 65536 - DON[n-1] + DON[n]

         If (DON[n] > DON[n-1] and DON[n] - DON[n-1] >= 32768),
            AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1] - (DON[n-1] + 65536 -
            DON[n])

         If (DON[n] < DON[n-1] and DON[n-1] - DON[n] < 32768),
            AbsDon[n] = AbsDon[n-1] - (DON[n-1] - DON[n])

   For any two NAL units m and n, the following applies:

   o  AbsDon[n] greater than AbsDon[m] indicates that NAL unit n follows
      NAL unit m in NAL unit decoding order.

   o  When AbsDon[n] is equal to AbsDon[m], the NAL unit decoding order
      of the two NAL units can be in either order.

Internet-Draft         RTP payload format for EVC             March 2020


   o  AbsDon[n] less than AbsDon[m] indicates that NAL unit n precedes
      NAL unit m in decoding order.



         Informative note: When two consecutive NAL units in the NAL
         unit decoding order have different values of AbsDon, the
         absolute difference between the two AbsDon values may be
         greater than or equal to 1.



         Informative note: There are multiple reasons to allow for the
         absolute difference of the values of AbsDon for two consecutive
         NAL units in the NAL unit decoding order to be greater than
         one.  An increment by one is not required, as at the time of
         associating values of AbsDon to NAL units, it may not be known
         whether all NAL units are to be delivered to the receiver.  For
         example, a gateway might not forward VCL NAL units of higher
         sub-layers or some SEI NAL units when there is congestion in
         the network.  In another example, the first intra-coded picture
         of a pre-encoded clip is transmitted in advance to ensure that
         it is readily available in the receiver, and when transmitting
         the first intra-coded picture, the originator does not exactly
         know how many NAL units will be encoded before the first intra-
         coded picture of the pre-encoded clip follows in decoding
         order.  Thus, the values of AbsDon for the NAL units of the
         first intra-coded picture of the pre-encoded clip have to be
         estimated when they are transmitted, and gaps in values of
         AbsDon may occur.

5.  Packetization Rules

   The following packetization rules apply:

   o  If sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0 for any of the RTP
      streams, the transmission order of NAL units carried in the RTP
      stream MAY be different than the NAL unit decoding order and the
      NAL unit output order.

   o  A NAL unit of a small size SHOULD be encapsulated in an
      aggregation packet together with one or more other NAL units in
      order to avoid unnecessary packetization overhead for small NAL
      units.  For example, non-VCL NAL units such as access unit
      delimiters, parameter sets, or SEI NAL units are typically small
      and can often be aggregated with VCL NAL units without violating
      MTU size constraints.




Zhao & Wenger          Expires September 11, 2020              [Page 25]

Internet-Draft         RTP payload format for EVC             March 2020


   o  Each non-VCL NAL unit SHOULD, when possible from an MTU size match
      viewpoint, be encapsulated in an aggregation packet together with
      its associated VCL NAL unit, as typically a non-VCL NAL unit would
      be meaningless without the associated VCL NAL unit being
      available.

   o  For carrying exactly one NAL unit in an RTP packet, a single NAL
      unit packet MUST be used.

6.  De-packetization Process

   The general concept behind de-packetization is to get the NAL units
   out of the RTP packets in an RTP stream and pass them to the decoder
   in the NAL unit decoding order.

   The de-packetization process is implementation dependent.  Therefore,
   the following description should be seen as an example of a suitable
   implementation.  Other schemes may be used as well, as long as the
   output for the same input is the same as the process described below.
   The output is the same when the set of output NAL units and their
   order are both identical.  Optimizations relative to the described
   algorithms are possible.

   All normal RTP mechanisms related to buffer management apply.  In
   particular, duplicated or outdated RTP packets (as indicated by the
   RTP sequences number and the RTP timestamp) are removed.  To
   determine the exact time for decoding, factors such as a possible
   intentional delay to allow for proper inter-stream synchronization
   must be factored in.

   NAL units with NAL unit type values in the range of 0 to 55,
   inclusive, may be passed to the decoder.  NAL-unit-like structures
   with NAL unit type values in the range of 56 to 63, inclusive, MUST
   NOT be passed to the decoder.

   The receiver includes a receiver buffer, which is used to compensate
   for transmission delay jitter within individual RTP streams and
   across RTP streams, to reorder NAL units from transmission order to
   the NAL unit decoding order.  In this section, the receiver operation
   is described under the assumption that there is no transmission delay
   jitter within an RTP stream.  To make a difference from a practical
   receiver buffer that is also used for compensation of transmission
   delay jitter, the receiver buffer is hereafter called the de-
   packetization buffer in this section.  Receivers should also prepare
   for transmission delay jitter; that is, either reserve separate
   buffers for transmission delay jitter buffering and de-packetization
   buffering or use a receiver buffer for both transmission delay jitter
   and de-packetization.  Moreover, receivers should take transmission

   delay jitter into account in the buffering operation, e.g., by
   additional initial buffering before starting of decoding and
   playback.

   When sprop-max-don-diff is equal to 0 for the received RTP stream,
   the de-packetization buffer size is zero bytes, and the process
   described in the remainder of this paragraph applies.  The NAL units
   carried in the RTP stream are directly passed to the decoder in their
   transmission order, which is identical to their decoding order.  When
   there are several NAL units of the same RTP stream with the same NTP
   timestamp, the order to pass them to the decoder is their
   transmission order.

      Informative note: The mapping between RTP and NTP timestamps is
      conveyed in RTCP SR packets.  In addition, the mechanisms for
      faster media timestamp synchronization discussed in [RFC6051] may
      be used to speed up the acquisition of the RTP-to-wall-clock
      mapping.

   When sprop-max-don-diff is greater than 0 for the received RTP stream
   the process described in the remainder of this section applies.

   There are two buffering states in the receiver: initial buffering and
   buffering while playing.  Initial buffering starts when the reception
   is initialized.  After initial buffering, decoding and playback are
   started, and the buffering-while-playing mode is used.

   Regardless of the buffering state, the receiver stores incoming NAL
   units, in reception order, into the de-packetization buffer.  NAL
   units carried in RTP packets are stored in the de-packetization
   buffer individually, and the value of AbsDon is calculated and stored
   for each NAL unit.

   Initial buffering lasts until condition A (the difference between the
   greatest and smallest AbsDon values of the NAL units in the de-
   packetization buffer is greater than or equal to the value of sprop-
   max-don-diff) or condition B (the number of NAL units in the de-
   packetization buffer is greater than the value of sprop-depack-buf-
   nalus) is true.

   After initial buffering, whenever condition A or condition B is true,
   the following operation is repeatedly applied until both condition A
   and condition B become false:

   o  The NAL unit in the de-packetization buffer with the smallest

   When no more NAL units are flowing into the de-packetization buffer,
   all NAL units remaining in the de-packetization buffer are removed
   from the buffer and passed to the decoder in the order of increasing
   AbsDon values.

10.  Security Considerations

   The scope of this Security Considerations section is limited to the
   payload format itself and to one feature of [EVC] that may pose a
   particularly serious security risk if implemented naively.  The
   payload format, in isolation, does not form a complete system.
   Implementers are advised to read and understand relevant security-
   related documents, especially those pertaining to RTP (see the
   Security Considerations section in [RFC3550] ), and the security of
   the call-control stack chosen (that may make use of the media type
   registration of this memo).  Implementers should also consider known
   security vulnerabilities of video coding and decoding implementations
   in general and avoid those.

   Within this RTP payload format, neither the various media-plane-based
   mechanisms, nor the signaling part of this memo, seems to pose a
   security risk beyond those common to all RTP-based systems.

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [RFC3550], and in any applicable RTP profile such as
   RTP/AVP [RFC3551], RTP/AVPF [RFC4585], RTP/SAVP [RFC3711], or RTP/
   SAVPF [RFC5124].  However, as "Securing the RTP Framework: Why RTP
   Does Not Mandate a Single Media Security Solution" [RFC7202]
   discusses, it is not an RTP payload format's responsibility to
   discuss or mandate what solutions are used to meet the basic security
   goals like confidentiality, integrity and source authenticity for RTP
   in general.  This responsibility lays on anyone using RTP in an
   application.  They can find guidance on available security mechanisms
   and important considerations in "Options for Securing RTP Sessions"
   [RFC7201].  Applications SHOULD use one or more appropriate strong
   security mechanisms.  The rest of this section discusses the security
   impacting properties of the payload format itself.

   Because the data compression used with this payload format is applied
   end-to-end, any encryption needs to be performed after compression.
   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encodings using
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end
   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams
   into the bitstream that are complex to decode and that cause the
   receiver to be overloaded.  EVC is particularly vulnerable to such
   attacks, as it is extremely simple to generate datagrams containing
   NAL units that affect the decoding process of many future NAL units.
   Therefore, the usage of data origin authentication and data integrity
   protection of at least the RTP packet is RECOMMENDED, for example,
   with SRTP [RFC3711].

   End-to-end security with authentication, integrity, or
   confidentiality protection will prevent a MANE from performing media-
   aware operations other than discarding complete packets.  In the case
   of confidentiality protection, it will even be prevented from
   discarding packets in a media-aware way.  To be allowed to perform
   such operations, a MANE is required to be a trusted entity that is
   included in the security context establishment.

11.  Congestion Control

   Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance with RTP
   [RFC3550] and with any applicable RTP profile, e.g., AVP [RFC3551].
   If best-effort service is being used, an additional requirement is
   that users of this payload format MUST monitor packet loss to ensure
   that the packet loss rate is within an acceptable range.  Packet loss

   is considered acceptable if a TCP flow across the same network path,
   and experiencing the same network conditions, would achieve an
   average throughput, measured on a reasonable timescale, that is not
   less than all RTP streams combined is achieving.  This condition can
   be satisfied by implementing congestion-control mechanisms to adapt
   the transmission rate, the number of layers subscribed for a layered
   multicast session, or by arranging for a receiver to leave the
   session if the loss rate is unacceptably high.

   The bitrate adaptation necessary for obeying the congestion control
   principle is easily achievable when real-time encoding is used, for
   example, by adequately tuning the quantization parameter.  However,
   when pre-encoded content is being transmitted, bandwidth adaptation
   requires the pre-coded bitstream to be tailored for such adaptivity.
   The key mechanism available in [EVC] is temporal scalability.  A
   media sender can remove NAL units belonging to higher temporal sub-
   layers (i.e., those NAL. units with a high value of TID) until the
   sending bitrate drops to an acceptable range.

   The mechanisms mentioned above generally work within a defined
   profile and level and, therefore, no renegotiation of the channel is
   required.  Only when non-downgradable parameters (such as profile)
   are required to be changed does it become necessary to terminate and
   restart the RTP stream(s).  This may be accomplished by using
   different RTP payload types.

   MANEs MAY remove certain unusable packets from the RTP stream when
   that RTP stream was damaged due to previous packet losses.  This can
   help reduce the network load in certain special cases.  For example,
   MANES can remove those FUs where the leading FUs belonging to the
   same NAL unit have been lost or those dependent slice segments when
   the leading slice segments belonging to the same slice have been
   lost, because the trailing FUs or dependent slice segments are
   meaningless to most decoders.  MANES can also remove higher temporal
   scalable layers if the outbound transmission (from the MANE's
   viewpoint) experiences congestion.
