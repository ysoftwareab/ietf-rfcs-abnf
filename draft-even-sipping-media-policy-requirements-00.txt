Internet-Draft                media policy                 February 2003


1. Introduction

   The Conferencing Framework [2] presents an overall framework and
   defines the terminology for SIP [1] tightly coupled conferencing.
   The conferencing framework architecture includes the media policy.
   This is a set of rules that describes the media distribution of a
   conference.  This document presents the requirements for the media
   policy data model and for the manipulations on these rules by
   conference participants or third parties using any kind of media/
   conference policy control protocol.  This document does not address
   the interface between the focus and the media policy and between the
   focus and the media mixer.

2. Rational

   The media policy enables a conference participant or an application
   server to define and manipulate the content of the media streams
   going to the conference participants.  This will enable applications
   like sidebars, announcement to specific participants, call centers
   and panel conferences.

3. Terminology

   The draft relies on the terminology defined in the conferencing
   framework document[2].

4. High Level Architecture

   The basic conferencing architecture used in this document is defined
   in the Conferencing architecture framework [2].  This document
   focuses on the media policy component and the requirements to
   manipulate the media policy by authorized entities.

   An authorized entity can manipulate the media policy using a supplied
   application.  Examples for such applications include a web
   application, an interactive voice response application, an
   interactive Instant Messaging (IM) base application, or an
   application that uses the media policy control protocol.

   The Conference policy control protocol (CPCP) provides a standard way
   for an automated authorized entity to manipulate the media policy.
   The requirements and definition of the CPCP protocol are out of scope
   of this document.

   The media policy is a set of rules that describes the media mixing or
   switching required for each participant in the conference.  This
   includes the set of sources to be mixed or switched and the rules for
   their mixing or switching.  The focus uses the media policy to

Internet-Draft                media policy                 February 2003


   determine the proper configuration of the mixers.  Authorized
   entities will be notified of changes to the media policy by
   subscribing to the conference event package.  The information about
   the current contributing sources to the mixed streams can be learned
   by the information in the RTP header or by the conference event
   package [4].  The data structures that include the contributing
   sources of the current streams is in the focus or the mixer and is
   not in the scope of the work.

   The initial state of the media policy data structure is defined at
   the conference creation time.  It can be either provisioned or
   created by using a conference policy control protocol or/and other
   protocols being used to create the conference.

   Typically, a focus has access to the media policy and is responsible
   for translating the media policy data into the actions towards the
   physical entities ("mixers").

   Figure 1 describes an instance of media policy of a conference.  The
   figure shows a single mixer and a single type of stream for ease of
   drawing but the model does not have such a restriction.

5. Media Policy Data Model

5.1 General

   The fundamental conferencing functionality is being able to combine
   (i.e.  "to mix") in a media specific manner participants' streams
   that belong to a logical sub-function within a conference (such as
   participant's video, left audio stream, right audio stream, video
   streaming presentation, slide presentation) and are of the same media
   type (such as video, audio, etc.).  In the case of using
   centralized-mixing the resultant stream(s) will be sent back to the
   participants.  In the case of end-point mixing, the original streams,
   needed to produce the mixed media, will be distributed to the
   participants that will perform the actual mixing.

   Typically, the maximum number of different mixers in a conference is
   preconfigured as part of the media conference policy.  Mixers MAY be
   dynamically created and destroyed during the conference lifetime.

   Conferencing mixing scenarios include simple conferences that have
   well known mixing characteristics (e.g.  mix audio of N loudest
   speakers) as well as conferences that enable the users of the media
   policy to create custom mixes (e.g.  Mix the audio of John and Mary)

   An example of an audio mixer is shown in Figure 2 (Wide lines specify
   a set of a streams).  The audio mixer in the example is for a simple
   audio conference that mixes the audio of three loudest speakers.  The
   speakers will not hear themselves.  The mixer will choose the three
   loudest speakers from all the conference participants and will mix
   them.  The output from the mixer will be four mixed audio streams.
   The first one is the sum of all three loudest speakers, the other
   three streams are the streams that will be sent to the speakers and
   each of them will include the mix of the other two loudest
   participants.

5.2 Mixer

   The mixers are composed of logical blocks "mixer block" each mixer
   block has input streams, output streams and is characterized by an
   operation that describes the transformation from the input streams to
   the output streams.  The operations can instruct the mixer block to
   perform a selection operation on the incoming streams, a mixing
   function or a transformation on a stream.

   The number of mixer blocks inside a mixer is dynamic.  The output
   from one block may serve as input to another block by using the
   output stream descriptor as input to a mixer block.  The solution
   will try to reduce the number of blocks needed to define a conference
   mix.  This can be achieved by having rules that will enable a focus
   to control a mixer based on minimal number of rules.

   Each mixer has a set of input streams from the participants (called
   contributing streams) and a set of output streams to the participants
   (called distributed streams).  For this purpose, a participant can be
   a SIP UA , a media server (such as an announcement server), or a
   recording system.

   Each participant incoming (to the focus) stream MUST NOT be
   associated with more than a single contributing stream of a single
   mixer.

   The number and the type of the contributing and distributed streams
   is usually dynamic.  During the conference lifetime, the input and
   the output media stream attributes (such as bandwidth, rate, CODEC,
   resolution, etc.) are being defined dynamically such as by means of
   the SDP m- lines as a part of the Offer-Answer[3] mechanism.

5.3 Mixer block examples

   The media policy enables the creation of different conferencing
   scenarios.  An example of a main audio conference and a sidebar is
   shown in figure 3.

               Figure 3: Audio Conference with sidebar

   The main conference is the same as in figure 2.  The sidebar
   conference includes two participants and the main conference audio at
   a lower volume.  The output from the sidebar includes two mixes each
   with one of the participants and the main audio with the reduced
   volume and there will be a stream that will include a mix of all
   three streams.

   The blocks of the main conference are showing the operations on the
   conference incoming streams.  The Loudest(3) block gets as input all
   the contributing audio streams of the conference and selects the
   three that represent the speakers with the highest volume.  Those
   streams are coming out as Loudout.  The Loudout set of streams is an
   input to the MixMinus(3) block.  This block will be used by the focus
   to tell the media mixer to create 4 output streams, one with all
   three sources and three that are a mix of each two of the
   participants.  These are the distributed streams and the focus knows
   who are the receivers of each of the streams.  The SelectMain block
   is used to select the main mix of the conference which include the
   mix of all the three loudest participants, this stream will be an
   input to the sidebar.

   The sidebar has three blocks.  The In*0.4 takes the input stream and

Internet-Draft                media policy                 February 2003


   attenuate it to 0.4 of its volume.  The MixMinus block is the same as
   the one in the main mixer but it mix only the two loudest speakers
   and create three output streams.  The Add block get as input all
   streams called SideBout (from the previous two blocks) and mixes
   them.  Each output stream from the In block is mixed with each output
   stream of the MixMinus block.  This will create three mixed streams
   that the focus can use to send to the sidebar participants.

   The main conference can be describe as:

   MainAudio ------Loudest(3)-----> Loudout

   Loudout-------MixMinus(3)------>MainMixAudio

   MainMixAudio------SelectMain------->All

   The sidebar conference can be described as:

   SidebarIn-----MixMinus(2)---->SideBout

   All----------------0.4In------>SideBout

   SideBout-----------Add------->SideBmix

   The description include predefined operations which are: Loudest(N),
   MixMinus(N),Main,  In, Mix.  Those operation and others will be
   specified as part of the media rules definition.  The CPCP will carry
   those media policy rules to the conference policy server where they
   will be stored as media policy.

5.4 Video layout

   Video mixing has two general models.

   The first one is video switching where the conference bridge sends
   one of the incoming streams as is  to the participants.  An example
   is voice activated video switching where all the participants see the
   loudest speaker while the speaker sees the previous speaker.

   The second one is known as continuous presence.  In this mode the
   video mixer builds a composite video that displays each contributing
   stream in a sub-window.  Example is a 2x2 display as in figure 4;
   each sub-window has a number.

                Figure 4: 2x2 video layout

   There are well known window layout that can be specified by naming
   convention to enable simple rules for mapping a video stream to a
   window.  We can add custom window definition support that will serve
   the creation of more complicated layouts.  The numbering of the
   sub-windows will start from the top-left sub-window and from left to
   right as in figure 4.

6. Media Policy Requirements

   All the requirements are based on having a privilege mechanism that
   authorizes users to access and manipulate the media policy data.

6.1 Genera Media Policy Requirements

   REQ-GP1: A participant MUST be able to specify its own unique
   topology.

   REQ-GP2: It must be possible for a group of users to receive the same
   mix.  This mix may be a conference common mix.

   REQ-GP3:It MUST be possible to dynamically modify the number of
   contributing streams associated with a mixer.

   REQ-GP4: It MUST be possible to define the mixing function for each
   participant in the conference.

   REQ-GP6: It SHOULD be possible to send a participant multiple streams
   from one mixer.  This requirement is to enable support for end- point
   mixing.

   REQ-GP7: It SHOULD be possible to define relationships between
   different mixers.  The relationships can be time synchronized such as
   specifying that the audio mixer and video mixer is a pair to
   establish lip-synchs.

   REQ-GP8: It SHOULD be possible to define the number of different

Internet-Draft                media policy                 February 2003


   topologies and the number of streams in each of them that will be
   mixed in a mixer.  For example the conference will support only one
   video topology that will go to all the participants, the video
   topology will support 2x2 display, or each participant will be able
   to receive his own audio topology that will include up to 4
   contributing sources.

6.2 Video specific requirements

   Video is a bit different than audio when mixing is concerned.  In
   multipoint video the common mixing modes are:

   Video switching where one of the contributing sources is sent to all
   participants, the video source may be forced by the media policy
   control protocol or may be dynamic by using for example a voice
   activated video switching mode where the participants will see the
   loudest speaker.

   "Continuous presence" or tiled windows display where the topology is
   composing one video stream that has a layout defining the shape and
   position of viewing windows that will be displayed to the
   participants.  The layout includes N viewing windows so that in each
   of the windows there is one contributing stream.  Even though the
   viewing windows can be of any shape we will address in this work only
   rectangular windows of any size.  The windows may overlap.

   The section defines the specific requirements for media policy and
   media policy control to enable "Continuous presence"

   REQ-V1: It should be possible to define rectangular overlapping
   windows in a video mix.

   REQ-V2: It should be possible to map a stream to a window based on
   some mode like having one window display the loudest speaker or the
   floor holder while for the remaining windows fixed input streams are
   used.

   REQ-V3: It should be possible for authorized participants to change
   the layout of the video topology.

   REQ-V4: It should be possible for authorized participants to define
   the mapping of a stream to a window.

7. Security Considerations

   The media policy control protocol may enables unauthorized users to
   manipulate the media mixing of conferences, this may enable them to
   listen to conference or eject unsolicited media streams.  The

   protocol should provide authentication of the users.  The media
   policy data may include information about the sources and targets of
   mixer, if this information will be transferred in the protocol in the
   clear that may cause a security risk.  The protocol should allow for
   encryption of the media policy transferred in the media policy
   control protocol.

8. Appendix I - Media Policy Operations

   The examples in sections 5.2 and 5.3 included the mixer blocks and
   their description.  The appendix will try to list well known
   operations that can serve to define building blocks.  Those
   operations will be part of the media policy syntax that is part of
   the media policy document.  The operation appear here for information
   only.

   Each mixer is built from mixer blocks.  Each block defines an
   operation on a set of streams, the operations can be a selection or a
   mixing operation and the result is a set of streams (One or more)
   depending on the operation.  By collection a set of such operations
   we define a mixer in the media policy.  The input and output of the
   operations are streams.  The streams can be named by tagging
   individual m-lines in their SDP with an associated i-line or by
   specifying an alias in the contents of the current media policy
   description.  Operations for selecting specific streams from a
   well-known group will also be defined.

   The appendix will list the operation specifying the input and output
   of each operation and will explain the semantics of the operation.

8.1 Stream selection operations

   Loudest(N) - This operation will receive as input a set of audio
   streams and will output N streams selected according to the volume
   levels starting from the highest

   LastLoudest - This operation will receive as input a set of audio
   streams and will select the audio stream of the participant that was
   the loudest speaker in the previous mix (This is the audio mix set
   before the current one)

   Not(Qualifier) - This operation will receive as input a set of audio
   streams and will select a stream that does not include a stream based
   on the Qualifier.  The qualifier can be a stream name or alias or an
   operation.  Example Not(Loudest) will select the stream that does not
   have the Loudest stream as one of its contributing sources.

   SelectMain- the operation will select from a set of input stream the

   stream that represent the main mix that include all contributing
   sources.  The operation may be replaced by defining a well-known
   stream definition call MainAudio.

   In(transformation) - The operation will perform the operation on the
   incoming stream or set of streams.  An example is In(0.4) will
   attenuate the incoming stream by 0.6

   VofLoudest(N) - The operation will get as input a set of video
   streams and will select the N video streams of the participants
   according to their audio volume level.

   AssignToWID(N) - This operation will assign the incoming video stream
   to the subwindow N in a tiled video display.

8.2 Mixing Operation

   MixMinus(N) - The operation will mix the N incoming streams and will
   create N+1 output streams.  The output streams will include one
   stream that is a mix of all input streams and N different streams
   that are a mix of all input streams without one of them.  This is
   very useful for audio conferences where participants do not want to
   have their voice in the mix they receive from the conferencing
   bridge.

   Mix - The operation creates a single mix of all input sources.  It
   has one output stream.

   Add - This operation gets two input sets of streams and add them to
   create the added mix.  For example if one set has 2 stream2 and the
   second set has 3 streams the result will be 6 output streams.  Each
   of the combined streams will  be a mix of a stream from the first set
   with a  stream from the second set.

   VideoMix(Layout) - the operation will take the incoming video streams
   and assign them according to their sub-window IDs to the layout.  The
   layout may be predefined by a well known name or custom defined.  The
   output stream will be the tiled video mix.

8.3 Well known streams

   MainAudioIn- this is the set of all contributing sources to the main
   audio conference.

   LoudestSpeaker(N) - This is the stream of the Nth loudest speaker.
   N=1 is the loudest.

   VideoLayout(N) - This is a tiled video layout.  N specifies the table

   entry number that describes the specific layout.  A table of all
   pre-defined video layout will be defined.
