          The Universal IPv6 Configuration Option (experiment)
                draft-troan-6man-universal-ra-option-02

Abstract

   One of the original intentions for the IPv6 host configuration, was
   to configure the network-layer parameters only with IPv6 ND, and use
   service discovery for other configuration information.  Unfortunately
   that hasn't panned out quite as planned, and we are in a situation
   where all kinds of configuration options are added to RAs and DHCP.
   This document proposes a new universal option for RA and DHCP in a
   self-describing data format, with the list of elements maintained in
   an IANA registry, with greatly relaxed rules for registration.

1.  Introduction

   This document proposes a new universal option for the Router
   Advertisement IPv6 ND message [RFC4861] and DHCPv6 [RFC8415].  It's
   purpose is to use the RA or DHCP message as an opaque carrier for
   configuration information between an agent on a router or DHCP server
   and host / host application.

   DHCP is suited to give per-client configuration information, while
   the RA mechanism advertises configuration information to all hosts on
   the link.  There is a long running history of "conflict" between the
   two.  The arguments go; there is less fate-sharing in DHCP, DHCP
   doesn't deal with multiple sources of information, or make it more
   difficult to change information independent of the lifetimes, RA
   cannot be used to configure different information to different
   clients and so on.  And of course some options are only available in
   RAs and some options are only available in DHCP.

   While this proposal does not resolve the DHCP vs RA debate, it
   proposes an experimental solution to the problem of a very slow
   process of standardizing new options, and the IETF spending an
   inordinate amount of time arguing over new configuration options.

3.  The Experiment

   This document specifies a new "self-describing" universal
   configuration option.  Currently new configuration option requires
   "standards action".  The purpose of the experiment is two-fold.  What
   are the implications of an opaque configuration option that should
   not require any code changes for new elements within the option?  And
   what happens when change control is relaxed?  The proposal is that no
   IETF document is required.  The configuration option is described
   directly in the universal configuration IANA registry.

   Duration of experiment: 2 years.

   How to evaluate success?  How many new options have been defined.
   Did expert review suffice to stop "harmful" options?  Were any of the
   options implemented and deployed?  On a successful experiment, the
   time limit of the registry will be removed and it's experimental
   status will be removed.  If the experiment is deemed a failure, then
   the registry will be removed.

4.  The Universal IPv6 Configuration option

   The option data is described using the schema language CDDL
   [RFC8610], encoded in CBOR [RFC7049].

       }

                                  Figure 2

   The universal IPv6 Configuration option MUST be small enough to fit
   within a single IPv6 ND or DHCPv6 packet.  It then follows that a
   single element in the dictionary cannot be larger than what fits
   within a single option.  Different elements can be split across
   multiple universal configuration options (in separate ND RA packets).

   All IANA registered elements are under the "ietf" key in the
   dictionary.  Private configuration information can be included in the
   option using different keys.

5.  Implementation Guidance

   The purpose of this option is to allow users to use the RA or DHCP as
   an opaque carrier for configuration information without requiring
   code changes in the option carrying infrastructure.

   On the router or DHCP server side there should be an API allowing a
   user to add an element, e.g. a JSON object [RFC8259] or a pre-encoded
   CBOR string to RAs sent on a given interface or to DHCP messages sent
   to a client.

Internet-Draft                    UA RA                       April 2020


   On the host side, an API should be available allowing applications to
   subscribe to received configuration elements.  It should be possible
   to subscribe to configuration object by dictionary key.

   The contents of any elements that are not recognized, either in whole
   or in part, by the receiving host MUST be ignored and the remainder
   of option's contents processed as normal.

6.  Implementation Status

   The Universal IPv6 configuration option sending side is implemented
   in VPP (https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP).

   The implementation is a prototype released under Apache license and
   available at: https://github.com/vpp-dev/vpp/
   commit/156db316565e77de30890f6e9b2630bd97b0d61d.

7.  Security Considerations

   Unless there is a security relationship between the host and the
   router (e.g.  SEND), and even then, the consumer of configuration
   information can put no trust in the information received.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add a new registry for the Universal IPv6
   Configuration option.  The registry should be named "IPv6 ND RA
   Universal option (experimental)".  Changes and additions to the
   registry require expert review [RFC8126].

   The schema field follows the CDDL schema definition in [RFC8610].

   The IANA is requested to add the universal option to the "IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery Option Formats" registry with the value of 42.

   The IANA is requested to add the universal option to the "Dynamic
   Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) Option Codes" registry.

8.1.  Initial objects in the registry

   The PVD [I-D.ietf-intarea-provisioning-domains] elements (and PIO,
   RIO [RFC4191]) are included to provide an alternative representation
   for the proposed new options in that draft.
