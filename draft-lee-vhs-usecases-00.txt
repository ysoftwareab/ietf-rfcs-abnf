1.  Virtual CPE Motivations

   Traditionally Network Service Providers (NSP) implement services in
   the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).  These services include NAT
   [RFC2663], Voice over IP (VoIP) adapter, IP management, personal
   firewall service, etc.  This model requires NSP updating the CPE
   firmware or upgrading the CPE hardware to support a new service.
   Often this update or upgrade process takes a significant effort.
   When a NSP virtualizes the CPE, services will be moved to the network
   and decoupled from the CPE.  The idea is to speedup service offering
   to users.

   Traditionally NSP serve an entire house behind a CPE as a functional
   unit.  Services are built around CPE but not around users or groups
   behind a CPE.  When virtualizing the CPE, NSP would like to offer
   more personalized services for individual users behind CPE.

   Problem Statement discusses the background and motivations of
   virtualizing home services.  The objective of this architecture is
   virtualizing home services and providing them in the network.  This
   draft will discuss some possible use cases that are required
   supporting virtualizing home services.

   describes the various functions defined in the diagram.

3.  Virtual CPE Use Case

   When virtualizing the home services and moving them to the network,
   there are uses cases the new architecture must address:

   1.  Local QoS Policy: In traditional CPE model, users manage local
       Quality of Service (QoS) for their devices.  For example: a user
       can give higher priority to VoIP than other services.  In Virtual
       CPE, this service will be virtualized in the network.  The
       network must provide an interface for users to configure local
       QoS policy.

   2.  Personal Firewall Policy: In traditional CPE model, users mange
       their local firewall rules in the CPE.  In Virtual CPE, this
       service will be virtualized in the network.  The NSP must provide
       an interface for users to configure local firewall policy..

   3.  NAT Service: Almost all CPE provide NAT service.  When NAT
       service is virtualized in the NSP network, NSP must be able to
       provision and manage NAT service for users.

   4.  IPv6 Transition Technology: Almost all IPv6 transition
       technologies (e.g., DS-Lite, MAP-E, MAP-T, lw4over6) require some
       functions defined in the CPE.  Updating the CPE in large scale to
       support the transition technologies is always a challenge that
       leads to slower IPv6 deployment.  Virtualizing IPv6 transition
       technology can ease the requirement to the CPE.

   5.  Personal M2M Service: In traditional CPE model, CPE often is the
       gateway of the M2M applications.  In Virtual CPE, M2M application
       gateway will be virtualized in the network.  The NSP must provide
       an interface to provision M2M devices and manage the M2M
       applications to provide services to the users.

   6.  Local Storage: In traditional CPE model, users can attach a local
       storage for personal contents.  In Virtual CPE, NSP can offer
       "virtual storage" to users over the network.  The virtual storage
       must appear local to the user's devices.

   7.  VPN Service: Some CPEs offer VPN (e.g., IPSec) service for home
       office users to connect to their office internal networks.  NSP
       must be able to provision and manage VPN service for users.

   8.  Event Notification: When virtualizing CPE, CPE and NSP network
       are tightly coupled.  CPE must be able to generate events to
       notify NSP when event occurs.  NSP may leverage exciting
       protocols such as [TR-69] for event notification.
