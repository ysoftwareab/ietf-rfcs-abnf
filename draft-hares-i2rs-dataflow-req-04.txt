1.  Introduction

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) Working Group is chartered
   with providing architecture and mechanisms to inject into and
   retrieve information from the routing system.  The I2RS Architecture
   document [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] abstractly documents a number
   of requirements for implementing the I2RS requirements.

   The I2RS Working Group has chosen to use the YANG data modeling
   language [RFC6020] as the basis to implement its mechanisms.

   Additionally, the I2RS Working group has chosen to use the NETCONF
   [RFC6241] and its similar but lighter-weight relative RESTCONF
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf] as the protocols for carrying I2RS.
   NETCONF and RESTCONF are suitable for handling the configuration
   portion of the I2RS protocol, but need extensions to handle the I2RS
   use cases described in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-usecase-reqs-summary].  The
   requirements for these functionalities have been specified:

   o  ephemeral state - as defined in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state]

   o  notifications and events - as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-pub-sub-requirements]

   o  traceability - as defined in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-traceability]

   o  protocol security - as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements]

   The requirements for the data flows in the following use cases have
   not been specified:

      Generic interfaces to Protocol Local-RIBs or Policy Data bases,

      Large data flows,

      Traffic monitoring data,

      Data flows for action sequences, and

      data flows during network outages or attacks

   This document describes the protocol requirements for these last five
   types of requirements.  The first summarizes the data flow
   requirements for the I2RS protocol version 1, and data flow
   requirements that may occur in future I2RS protocol versions.

   Section 3 provides details on the data flow requirements for the
   generic interfaces.  Section 4 considers large data flows and traffic
   monitoring data flows.  Section 5 considers data flows and
   constraints during action and attacks.

1.1.  Requirements language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Summary of I2RS Data Flow Requirements

   The following are the data flow related requirements for I2RS
   protocol version 1:

   I2RS-DF-REQ-01:No Validation RPCs   I2RS generic interfaces in I2RS
      protocol independent modules or I2RS protocol dependent modules
      should be able to optionally create rpcs which store configuration
      data in the I2RS ephemeral data store without the normal
      configuration checking.  The only thing check will be the syntax
      within the protocol packets.  The data models allowing must
      provide a "no-checking flag" at the level the rpc stores the data.
      For example, the I2RS RIB could create a rpc for a route-add that

Internet-Draft               I2RS Data Flow                     May 2016


      allowed a flag that indicates validation status ("full or no-
      checks")

   I2RS-DF-REQ-02: XML and JSON:    encoding formats SHOULD be supported
      in RESTCONF and NETCONF.

   I2RS-DF-REQ-03: Transport Protocols:    MAY be negotiated between
      I2RS client and I2RS agent from a list of mandatory transports and
      optional transports.

   I2RS-DF-REQ-04: Insecure Transport:    For a few select data models,
      the communication between the I2RS client and I2RS agent MAY run
      over an insecure transports.  The I2RS client and I2RS agent
      should negotiate this insecure protocol, and the portion of the
      data model which can be sent via the insecure transport SHOULD be
      marked in YANG data model with "i2rs-insecure-transport ok".

   I2RS-DF-REQ-05: Resource Contraints on the I2RS Agent:    should have
      the ability to constraints for OAM functions operating to limit
      CPU processing, data rate across a transport, the rate of
      publication of data in a subscription, and logging rates.

   I2RS-DF-REQ-06: Alternative Transport protocols or ports:   The I2RS
      should be able to support an OAM actions that select alternate
      transports from available list of transports, and to support
      selection of alternate ports for these protocols.  The alternate
      transports may have constraints specified for security levels,
      sizes of messages, or data flow priorities.

   I2RS-DF-REQ-07: Priorization of Data Flows:    The I2RS Agent should
      be able to prioritize some of the management data flows in the
      I2RS Agent-I2RS Client data flows.  This prioriziation can for
      data schedule for publication, data flows within a single
      transport, or data flows flows within a single transport, or
      between multiple data flow streams an I2RS Agent is sending.  This
      priorization may be for the data flows the I2RS Agent is
      receiving.

   DF-REQ-08: Yang indicates rpc with no validation:  Yang MUST have a
      way to indicate rpc can write without validating data except for
      syntax of data because I2RS client has validated data.

         ephemeral-validation nocheck"

   DF-REQ-09: Yang for Data sent over insecure transport :  Yang MUST
      have a way to indicate in a data model that insecure transmission
      is ok.

         i2rs-transport-insecure ok"

   Requirement for Future versions of I2RS Protocol:

      SHOULD be supported as an optional component protocol by the I2RS
      protocol.

3.  Generic Interfaces to Routing Functions

   The generic interfaces to the routing system includes generic
   interface to the RIB, forwarding policies, and an interface to the
   topology information.  The existing I2RS protocol independent data
   models have provided these generic models in the I2RS RIB
   ([I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model], [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-data-model]), the
   I2RS Filter-Based RIB ([I-D.kini-i2rs-fb-rib-info-model],
   [I-D.hares-i2rs-fb-rib-data-model]), and the topology genetric model
   ([I-D.ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo]) and plus layer models
   ([I-D.ietf-i2rs-yang-l2-network-topology],
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-yang-l3-topology].

   The only addition to the generic model is the ability for the I2RS
   client to be able to do all of the data value checking, and simply
   download the data to the I2RS Agent.  The I2RS RIB updates are done
   with rpcs (rib-add, rib-delete, route-add, route-delete, route-
   update, nh-add, nh-delete).  The I2RS FB-RIB updates are done with
   rpcs (fset-add, fs-dete, fpolicy-add, fpolicy-delete, fpolicy-update,
   fgroup-add, fgoup-delete, fgroup-update).  The requirement is to
   allow create rpcs that do not require validation, but simply input
   syntax.

3.1.  I2RS Data Flow Requirements

   [DF-REQ-01:No Validation RPCs  I2RS generic interfaces in I2RS
      protocol independent modules or I2RS protocol dependent modules
      should be able to optionally create rpcs which store configuration
      data in the I2RS ephemeral data store without the normal
      configuration checking.  The only thing check will be the syntax
      within the protocol packets.  The data models allowing must
      provide a "no-checking flag" at the level the rpc stores the data.
      For example, the I2RS RIB could create a rpc for a route-add that
      allowed a flag that indicates no validation checks.

4.  Large Data Flow Requirements

   This section decribes the I2RS management data flow requirements for
   data transfers for large data flows, traffic measurments, and non-
   secure data flows.

Internet-Draft               I2RS Data Flow                     May 2016


   Large data transfers to/from the I2RS Agent can be from tables
   relating to generic interfaces (RIB, FIB, Filter-Based RIB policy,
   generic connectivity topologies), protocol state, traffic
   measurements or user state.  The generic interfaces were described in
   the section above.

   The I2RS interaction with the protocol are to configure the
   protocols, and retrieve general state information (RIB, FIB,
   topologies and policy).  The data flow for the management of protocol
   state has the same type of flows.

   The unique type of data flows are management flows based on traffic
   flow measurement or I2RS data traveling across insecure connections.
   These requirements are described in this section.

   Traffic monitoring can occur in a network under DDoS with high levels
   of congestion and loss the use of these protocols which rely on
   transport-level retransmission may not be as resilient as needed.
   The data flow problems involved in sending monitoring data during
   network congestion or outage are considered in section 5 on
   operations during network outages or congestoin.

4.1.  Use Case Requirements for Traffic Flow Measurements

   The I2RS requirements for the Protocol independent use cases requires
   the support of traffic flow measurements protocols (requirements PI-
   REQ-05, PI-REQ06 in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-usecase-reqs-summary]), and
   operational state regarding flow filtering.

   The following IETF protocol pass traffic flow measurements:

   o  IPFIX - IP Flow Information ([RFC7011]) that reports on a wide
      variety of routing system statistics, and

   o  IPPM - IP Performance mangement ([RFC2330], [RFC7312]) that
      reports on one-way or two-way end-to-end network performance
      statistics,

   In addition the SFLOW([RFC3176]) of layer 2 devices is supported by
   many routers.  Other traffic flows may be measured in support of IDS/
   IPS, but these will be covered in the section on security flows.

   Flow Filtering data models with policy rules (BGP Flow Specification,
   I2RS Filter-Based RIB, and n-tuple policy routing RIB) often save
   operational state on how often these policies are match.

   Traffic flow data can provide large streams of traffic.  The I2RS
   mechanism for handling the data bursts in these protocols is to

Internet-Draft               I2RS Data Flow                     May 2016


   utilize a traffic monitoring protocol, IPFIX) or to utilize a
   publication/subscription service in order to send just what clients
   want.

4.2.  Protocol Requirements based on Traffic Measurement Data Flows

   Due to the potentially large data flow the traffic measurment
   statistics generate, these statistics are best handled by publication
   techniques within NETCONF or a separate protocol such as IPFIX.  The
   publication/subscription model within NETCONF could use either push
   pub-sub model or a pull pub-sub model.  Thresholds for reporting can
   be set per data models or per client so the pub-sub model allows the
   I2RS client-I2RS Agent to meter the amount of data flow these
   statistics carry.  The push portion of the pub-sub model is supported
   by [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push], but the pull portion of the pub-sub
   model is not defined.

   The support of IPFIX protocol ([RFC7011]) as a component protocol in
   I2RS requires the I2RS Agent supports an IPFIX exporting process
   sending data to a I2RS client running an IPFIX collector process.
   The IPFIX templates could be stored as ephemeral state or reference
   configured state.  The IPFIX data flows may run over SCTP, UDP, or
   TCP utilizing the congestion services at each time.  The IPFIX
   connections assumes that: a) congestion is an temporary anomaly, b)
   dropping data during a congestion is reported, and c) for some
   exporiting process it is acceptable to have drop data in a reliable
   protocol.  The I2RS protocol must support the establishment of an
   IPFIX connection.

4.3.  Publication/Subscription Service

   All use case requirements for the publication/subscription service
   for the push service from large data requirements 01-04 and 6-12 is
   found in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-pub-sub-requirements], and an example
   protocol addition to netconf is include in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push].

   The requirements for the publication/subscription service for the
   pull model are not specified in the
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-pub-sub-requirements], but a majority of the pub-sub
   requirements and mechanisms can be reused.  In a pull, the publisher
   prepares the data that is pulled by a few receivers who then
   distribute it to the receivers.  The pull mechanism would have a
   different "pull latency" versus the push latencey, and a set of
   parameters which indicate the amount of data stored if receivers did
   not pull the data within a certain time.

Internet-Draft               I2RS Data Flow                     May 2016


   At this time, the pull-model of the publication/subscription model is
   not being requested by vendors or operators.

4.4.  Data Flow Requirements for Transports

   The use case requirements ([I-D.ietf-i2rs-usecase-reqs-summary]) for
   large data flows also include support for data flows via any
   transport (L-Dat-REQ-04) and any data format (L-Data-REQ-05).

   One of the requirements is to be able to support an insecure
   transport for a small set of data.  Examples of this type of data may
   be outage/restoration information the operator wishes to make public.

4.5.  I2RS Requirements for Large Data Flow

   Current Data Flow Requirements:

   I2RS-DF-REQ-02: XML and JSON:    encoding formats SHOULD be supported
      in RESTCONF and NETCONF.

   I2RS-DF-REQ-03: Transport Protocols:    MAY be negotiated between
      I2RS client and I2RS agent from a list of mandatory transports and
      optional transports.

   I2RS-DF-REQ-04: Insecure Transport:    For a few select data models,
      the communication between the I2RS client and I2RS agent MAY run
      over an insecure transports.  The I2RS client and I2RS agent
      should negotiate this insecure protocol, and the portion of the
      data model which can be sent via the insecure transport SHOULD be
      marked in YANG data model with "i2rs-insecure-transport ok".

   Future Data Flow Requirements:

   Future-DF-REQ-01: IPFIX Protocol and templates:  SHOULD be supported
      as an optional component protocol by the I2RS protocol.

5.  I2RS Data Flow during OAM or Outages

   The data flow requirements for Operations and Management (OAM)
   actions must be able to be constrained in order not to impact the
   routing system.  During periods of normal connectivity, it is
   important that any OAM function not impact the the routing systems
   function.  During periods of outage, the I2RS protocol must operate
   when data bandwidth is reduced and network connectivity fluctuates.
   The constraints on the I2RS client-agent communication may be
   increased or decreased from the normal state depending on what
   management traffic needs to flow in order to help detect outages or
   resist attacks.

Internet-Draft               I2RS Data Flow                     May 2016


   I2RS agents must be able to adjust operation of event notifications,
   logging, or data traffic during these outage periods.  Data Models
   and I2RS agent configuration must allow operator-applied policy to
   prioritize data during this period.  The I2RS Agent should be able to
   signal the I2RS Client that such a time period is occuring.

   A quick list of some of the types of outages may illustrate why the
   I2RS agent need the ability to balance internal processing and the
   rate of communication with the I2RS client.  Network Outages may
   occur due connectivity failures or security attacks.  Security
   attacks can be distributed or target incidents that exploit
   vulnerabilities in software, network devices, protocols using
   botnets, malware attacks, identity theft, port spams, icmp blasts,
   and other attacks.  Some outages are caused by Distributed Denial of
   Service (DDoS) attacks may impact multiple routing systems so the
   constraints on management data flow may be required even when the
   routing system is not the specific device under attack.

5.1.  I2RS Data Flow Requirements during OAM or Outages

   I2RS-DF-REQ-05: Resource Contraints on the I2RS Agent:    should have
      the ability to constraints for OAM functions operating to limit
      CPU processing, data rate across a transport, the rate of
      publication of data in a subscription, and logging rates.

   I2RS-DF-REQ-06: Alternative Transport protocols or ports:   The I2RS
      should be able to support an OAM actions that select alternate
      transports from available list of transports, and to support
      selection of alternate ports for these protocols.  The alternate
      transports may have constraints specified for security levels,
      sizes of messages, or priority

   I2RS-DF-REQ-07: Priorization of Data Flows:    The I2RS Agent should
      be able to prioritize some of the management data flows in the
      I2RS Agent-I2RS Client data flows.  This prioriziation can for
      data schedule for publication, data flows within a single
      transport, or data flows flows within a single transport, or
      between multiple data flow streams an I2RS Agent is sending.

6.  Changes to YANG

   To support the above requirements, the yang modules will need to
   support the following features:

   DF-REQ-08: Yang indicates rpc with no validation:  Yang MUST have a
      way to indicate rpc can write without validating data except for
      syntax of data because I2RS client has validated data.
