 The Pseudowire (PW) & Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)
                     Implementation Survey Results
             draft-delregno-pw-vccv-impl-survey-results-00

Abstract

   Most Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandate
   the use of the Control Word (CW) in order to better emulate the
   services for which the encapsulations have been defined.  However,
   some encapulations treat the Control Word as optional.  As a result,
   implementations of the CW, for encapsulations for which it is
   optional, vary by equipment manufacturer, equipment model and service
   provider network.  Similarly, Virtual Circuit Connectivity
   Verification (VCCV) supports three Control Channel (CC) types and
   multiple Connectivity Verification (CV) Types.  This flexibility has
   led to reports of interoperability issues within deployed networks
   and associated drafts to attempt to remedy the situation.  This
   survey of the PW/VCCV user community was conducted to determine
   implementation trends.  The survey and results is presented herein.

1.  Introduction

   The PWE3 working group has defined many encapsulations of various
   Layer 1 and Layer 2 links.  Within these encapsulations, there are
   often several modes of encapsulation which have differing
   requirements in order to fully emulate the service.  As such, the use
   of the PWE3 Control Word is mandated in many of the encapsulations,
   but not all.  This can present interoperability issues related to A)
   Control Word use and B) VCCV Control Channel negotiation in mixed
   implementation environments.

   The encapsulations and modes for which the Control Word is currently
   optional are:

   o  Ethernet Tagged Mode

   o  Ethernet Raw Mode

   o  PPP

   o  HDLC

   o  Frame Relay Port Mode

   o  ATM (N:1 Cell Mode)

   [RFC5085] defines three Control Channel types for MPLS PW's: Type 1,
   using the Pseudowire Control Word, Type 2, using the Router Alert
   Label, and Type 3, using TTL Expiration (e.g.  MPLS PW Label with TTL
   == 1).  While Type 2 (RA Label) is indicated as being "the preferred
   mode of VCCV operation when the Control Word is not present," RFC
   5085 does not indicate a mandatory Control Channel to ensure
   interoperable implementations.  The closest it comes to mandating a
   control channel is the requirement to support Type 1 (Control Word)
   whenever the control word is present.  As such, the three options
   yield seven implementation permutations (assuming you have to support
   at least one Control Channel type to provide VCCV).  Due to these
   permuations, interoperability challenges have been identified by
   several VCCV users.

   In order to assess the best approach to address the observed
   interoperability issues, the PWE3 working group decided to solicit
   feedback from the PW and VCCV user community regarding
   implementation.  This document presents the survey and the
   information returned by the user community who participated.

Internet-Draft    PW/VCCV Implementation Survey Results       March 2011


1.1.  PW/VCCV Survey Overview

   Per the direction of the PWE3 Working Group chairs, a survey was
   created to sample the nature of implementations of Pseudowires, with
   specific emphasis on Control Word usage, and VCCV, with emphasis on
   Control Channel and Control Type usage.  The survey consisted of a
   series of questions based on direction of the WG chairs and the
   survey opened to the public on November 4, 2010.  The URL for the
   survey (now closed) was http://www.surveymonkey.com/pwe3/.  The
   survey ran from November 4, 2010 until February 25, 2011.

1.2.  PW/VCCV Survey Form

   The PW/VCCV Implementation Survey requested the following information
   about user implementations:

   - Responding Organziation.  No provisions were made for anonymity.
   All responses required a valid email address in order to validate the
   survey response.

   - Of the various encapsulations (and options therein) known at the
   time, including the WG draft for Fiber Channel), which were
   implemented b the respondent.  These included:

   o  Ethernet Tagged Mode - RFC 4448

   o  Ethernet Raw Mode - RFC 4448

   o  SAToP - RFC 4553

   o  PPP - RFC 4618

   o  HDLC - RFC 4618

   o  Fiber Channel (Port Mode) - draft-ietf-pwe3-fc-encap

   - Approximately how many Pseudowires of each type were deployed.
   Respondents could list a number, or for the sake of privacy, could
   just respond "In-Use" instead.

   - For each encapsulation listed above, the respondent could indicated
   which Control Channel was in use.  The options listed were:

   o  Control Word (Type 1)

   o  Router Alert Label (Type 2)

   o  TTL Expiry (Type 3)

   - For each encapsulation listed above, the respondent could indicate
   which Connectivity Verification types were in use.  The options were:

   o  ICMP Ping

   o  LSP Ping

   - For each encapsulation type for which the use of the Control Word
   is optional, the respondents could indicated the encaps for which
   Control Word was supported by the equipment used and whether it was
   in use in the network.  The encaps listed were:

   o  Ethernet (Tagged Mode)

   o  Ethernet (Raw Mode)

   o  PPP

   o  HDLC

   o  Frame Relay (Port Mode)

   o  ATM (N:1 Cell Mode)

   - Finally, a freeform entry was provided for the respondent to
   provide feedback regarding PW and VCCV deployments, VCCV
   interoperability challenges, the survey or any network/vendor details
   they wished to share.

2.7.  Open Ended Question

   Space was provided for user feedback.  The following instructions
   were given: "Please use this space to provide any feedback regarding
   PW and VCCV deployments, VCCV interoperability challenges, this
   survey or any network/vendor details you wish to share."  Below are
   the responses, made anonymous.

   1.  BFD VCCV Control Channel is not indicated in the survey (may be
       required for PW redundancy purpose)

   2.  Using CV is not required at the moment

   3.  COMPANY has deployed several MPLS network elements, from multiple
       vendors.  COMPANY is seeking a uniform implementation of VCCV
       Control Channel (CC) capabilities across its various vendor
       platforms.  This will provide COMPANY with significant advantages
       in reduced operational overheads when handling cross-domain
       faults.  Having a uniform VCCV feature implementation in COMPANY
       multi-vendor network leads to: o Reduced operational cost and
       complexity o Reduced OSS development to coordinate incompatible
       VCCV implementations. o Increased end-end service availability
       when handing faults.  In addition, currently some of COMPANY
       deployed VCCV traffic flows (on some vendor platforms) are not

       guaranteed to follow those of the customer's application traffic
       (a key operational requirement).  As a result, the response from
       the circuit ping cannot faithfully reflect the status of the
       circuit.  This leads to ambiguity regarding the operational
       status of our networks.  An in-band method is highly preferred,
       with COMPANY having a clear preference for VCCV Circuit Ping
       using PWE Control Word.  This preference is being pursued with
       each of COMPANY vendors.

   4.  PW VCCV is very useful tool for finding faults in each PW
       channel.  Without this we can not find fault on a PW channel.  PW
       VCCV using BFD is another better option.  Introperbility
       challences are with Ethernet OAM mechanism.

   5.  We are using L2PVPN AToM like-to-like models - ATMoMPLS - EoMPLS
       ATMoMPLS : This service offered for transporting ATM cells over
       IP/MPLS core with Edge ATM CE devices including BPX, Ericsson
       Media Gateway etc.  This is purely a Port mode with cell-packing
       configuration on it to have best performance.  QoS marking is
       done for getting LLQ treatment in the core for these MPLS
       encapsulated ATM packets.  EoMPLS: This service offered for
       transporting 2G/3G traffic from network such as Node-B to RNC's
       over IP/MPLS backbone core network.  QoS marking is done for
       getting guaranteed bandwidth treatment in the core for these MPLS
       encapsulated ATM packets.  In addition to basic L2VPN service
       configuration, these traffic are routed via MPLS TE tunnels with
       dedicated path and bandwidth defined to avoid bandwidth related
       congestion.

   6.  EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER does not provide options to configure VCCV
       control-channel and its sub options for LDP based L2Circuits.
       How can we achieve end-to-end management and fault detection of
       PW without VCCV in such cases?

   7.  I'm very interested in this work as we continue to experience
       interop challenges particularly with newer vendors to the space
       who are only implementing VCCV via control word.  Vendors who
       have tailed their MPLS OAM set specifically to the cell backhaul
       space and mandatory CW have been known to fall into this space.
       That's all I've got.


3.  Security Considerations

   As this document is a report of the PW/VCCV User Implementation
   Survey results, no security considerations are introduced.
