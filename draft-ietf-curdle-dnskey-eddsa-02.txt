Abstract

   This document describes how to specify EdDSA keys and signatures in
   DNS Security (DNSSEC).  It uses the Edwards-curve Digital Security
   Algorithm (EdDSA) with the choice of two curves, Ed25519 and Ed448.

1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC, which is broadly defined in [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and
   [RFC4035], uses cryptographic keys and digital signatures to provide
   authentication of DNS data.  Currently, the most popular signature
   algorithm in use is RSA.  GOST ([RFC5933]) and NIST-specified
   elliptic curve cryptography ([RFC6605]) are also standardized.

   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa] describes the elliptic curve signature system
   EdDSA and recommends two curves, Ed25519 and Ed448.

   This document defines the use of DNSSEC's DS, DNSKEY, and RRSIG
   resource records (RRs) with a new signing algorithm, Edwards-curve
   Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) using a choice of two instances:
   Ed25519 and Ed448.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  DNSKEY Resource Records

   An Ed25519 public key consists of a 32-octet value, which is encoded
   into the Public Key field of a DNSKEY resource record as a simple bit
   string.  The generation of a public key is defined in Section 5.1.5
   in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa].

   An Ed448 public key consists of a 57-octet value, which is encoded
   into the Public Key field of a DNSKEY resource record as a simple bit
   string.  The generation of a public key is defined in Section 5.2.5
   in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa].

4.  RRSIG Resource Records

   An Ed25519 signature consists of a 64-octet value, which is encoded
   into the Signature field of an RRSIG resource record as a simple bit
   string.  The Ed25519 signature algorithm is described in
   Section 5.1.6 and verification of the Ed25519 signature is described
   in Section5.1.7 in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa].

   An Ed448 signature consists of a 114-octet value, which is encoded
   into the Signature field of an RRSIG resource record as a simple bit
   string.  The Ed448 signature algorithm is described in Section 5.2.6
   and verification of the Ed448 signature is described in Section 5.2.7
   in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa].

5.  Algorithm Number for DS, DNSKEY and RRSIG Resource Records

   The algorithm number associated with the use of Ed25519 in DS, DNSKEY
   and RRSIG resource records is TBD1.  The algorithm number associated
   with the use of Ed448 in DS, DNSKEY and RRSIG resource records is
   TBD2.  This registration is fully defined in the IANA Considerations
   section.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the IANA registry "Domain Name System Security
   (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers".  The following entry has been added to
   the registry:

             +--------------+---------------+---------------+
             | Number       | TBD1          | TBD2          |
             | Description  | Ed25519       | Ed448         |
             | Mnemonic     | ED25519       | ED448         |
             | Zone Signing | Y             | Y             |
             | Trans. Sec.  | *             | *             |
             | Reference    | This document | This document |
             +--------------+---------------+---------------+

    * There has been no determination of standardization of the use of
                 this algorithm with Transaction Security.

9.  Security Considerations

   Ed25519 and Ed448 offers improved security properties and
   implementation characteristics compared to RSA and ECDSA algorithms,
   and the introduction of these algorithms are thus expected to improve
   security of DNSSEC.

   The security considerations of [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa] and [RFC7748]are
   inherited in the usage of Ed25519 and Ed448 in DNSSEC.

   Ed25519 is intended to operate at around the 128-bit security level,
   and Ed448 at around the 224-bit security level.  A sufficiently large
   quantum computer would be able to break both.  Reasonable projections
   of the abilities of classical computers conclude that Ed25519 is
   perfectly safe.  Ed448 is provided for those applications with
   relaxed performance requirements and where there is a desire to hedge
   against analytical attacks on elliptic curves.

   These assessments could, of course, change in the future if new
   attacks that work better than the ones known today are found.

   A private key used for a DNSSEC zone MUST NOT be used for any other
   purpose than for that zone.  Otherwise cross-protocol or cross-
   application attacks are possible.
