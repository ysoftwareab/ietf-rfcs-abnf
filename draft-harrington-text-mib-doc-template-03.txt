Note: Forward to RFC Editor

   Note to RFC Editor - throughout the template in the appendix, there
   are numerouse sample requests for action by the RFC Editor that
   should not be removed from the template before publication of the
   template.  These need to retain the RFC Editor requests to match the
   boilerplate included in the template.

   For simplicity, there are no notes to the RFC Editor in this document
   that should be removed, except THIS section - the complete section
   entitled "Note: Foreword to RFC Editor".

Internet-Draft      MIB Module Document Text Template           May 2007


1.  Introduction

   This memo contains an annotated template for IETF documents that
   contain the definition of MIB modules.  It it intended to alleviate
   the work of the authors of such documents, making these more uniform
   and easier to read and review, thus furthering the quality of such
   documents and expedite their publication.

2.  Overview

   The template enclosed in this document was developed at the request
   of the IETF MIB Doctor directorate, to make IETF documents that
   contain MIB modules more consistent.  This makes it easier for a MIB
   Doctor to review the document.  There are a number of MUSTs in the
   document; these usually refer to IESG requirements for internet
   drafts, and MIB Doctors are likely to check for these requirements.

   The template contains many boilerplates that are required for IETF
   MIB module documents.  Using the latest revision of this template
   should ensure that the latest revision of the boilerplates are used.
   The most up-to-date revision should be available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/ and
   http://www.rfc-editor.org/formatting.html.

   The template contains sections that describe the purpose and
   organization of the MIB module, and the relationship between this MIB
   module and other MIB modules.  This makes it easier for MIB Doctors
   to understand the MIB module, which speeds the review process.

   Editors should read RFC4181 "Guidelines for Authors and Reviewers of
   MIB Documents" [RFC4181] which describes best current practices for
   MIB module document editing.

   The document template does not include a template for the MIB module
   itself.  Tools to validate MIB modules typically require that the MIB
   module be separated from the surrounding document.  Thie MIB Doctors
   feel that the simplest approach is to develop the MIB module outside
   the document that contains the surrounding text, and then include the
   MIB module into the surrounding document written using this template.

   An XML version of this template is also available, for use with
   xml2rfc at http://www.ops.ietf.org/ and
   http://www.rfc-editor.org/formatting.html.  The xml2rfc version of
   the template contains advice in XML comments that should be helpful
   to help guide editors in some of the issues that should be
   considered when developing a MIB module internet draft.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular it defines
   objects for managing the [TODO]

   The Introduction should be expanded to include background on the MIB
   module that is in this internet draft.

   Some items to consider discussing in the introduction:

      Citations of protocol specs, architectures, and protocol-specific
      management requirements

      References to other, related MIB modules

      Overview of why a MIB module is appropriate for this protocol and
      how the module is to be used

      Highlights of anything 'different' about the module.  For example,
      a read-only.MIB

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework



Harrington              Expires November 17, 2007               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      MIB Module Document Text Template           May 2007


   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   checking MIB definitions can be found at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-review-tools.html

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module



Harrington              Expires November 17, 2007               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      MIB Module Document Text Template           May 2007


   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   For all MIB modules you must evaluate whether any readable objects
   are sensitive or vulnerable (for instance, if they might reveal
   customer information or violate personal privacy laws such as those
   of the European Union if exposed to unathorized parties)

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or

   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate

   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [TODO} select an option and provide the necessary details.  See
   "Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs"
   [RFC2434]

   Option #1:


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, an internet
   draft MUST use placeholders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in an internet draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
