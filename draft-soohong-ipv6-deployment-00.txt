Abstract   

This document presents a new configuration of EUI-64 format 
through defined Device ID for identification and characteristic
of all Devices in unmanaged network especially "Home network".
Because of configured Device ID, all Devices in network must be 
classified and communicated each other. The main purpose of 
this document is to deploy IPv6 easily and widely.

1 Introduction

IPv6 Address[ADDRARCH] is composed of Prefix information and Interface
ID which are made from MAC through IEEE EUI-64 Format. Since MAC is 48 
bits, special values (0xFFFE) are inserted between Company ID and 
Serial Number, and accordingly 64 bits Interface ID is completed.

This Document suggests a new usage of Device ID (16 bits) instead of
0xFFFE in order to define identification and unique characteristic of 
Device.

After unique Device ID is configured, Interface ID makes it own new 
EUI-64 Format which will be used to verify Device identification in 
the network. Also IPv6 address can create an its own identified address 
because low-order 64 bits of IPv6 address have unique Device ID. 
This address is both Link-local address and Global unique address.

In unmanaged network, most Devices may want to communicate very simply 
and easily, because unmanaged network is usually home network
or small office network. Otherwise, this configuration is simple, none 
will prefer using of IPv6. If IPv6 address is composed of Device ID, 
any other naming system (DNS: Domain Name Service) is not required, 
because Device ID is used as a Domain name. Also most Devices do not
require additional environment and consoles for address configuration.


2 Device ID
This section gives a brief overview of the Device ID (we define the
"Device ID" as a unique value of Interface ID) for the making of 
new EUI-64 format. Links or Nodes with IEEE 802 48 bit MAC's are 
as follows:


|0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|
|0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
|cccccc1gcccccccc|cccccccc11111111|11111110mmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+


where "c"s are the bits of the assigned company_id, "0" is the value of 
the universal/local bit to indicate global scope, "g" is individual/
group bit, and "m"s are the bits of the manufacturer-selected extension
identifier.

In order to make 64 bits EUI-64 from 48 bits MAC, special value (0xFFFE) 
must be added to MAC. Instead of 0xFFFE, we will configure defined 
Device ID of which value depends on network designer. 

                             
3 Operation Procedure
New Device addresses have unique Device ID, and user can 
verify and distinguish all devices using Device ID.





Park, Kim, Kim						      [page 2]


3.1 Obtaining Device address
In order to obtain Device address, user can use multicast address.
As defined in [ADDRARCH], All node Addresses identify the group of
all IPv6 nodes, within scope 1(node-local) or 2(link-local).



All Nodes Addresses:       FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
                             
step1: 
      sending All Node multicast address
step2: 
      receiving response with Device ID
step3: 
      obtaining the addresses of all devices. 
step4: 
      classifying the addresses of all devices using its own functions 
step5: 
      choosing and connecting wanted device
     
      
3.2 Operation Requirement
Hosts which want to connect to another devices, must have its own 
functions to classify and distinguish Device ID.  


3.3 Sorting of same Devices
There are a few same devices in unmanaged network. In order to 
distinguish same devices, hosts require a simple function, and sort 
same device using low-order 24bits of these addresses. IPv6 address 
includes Serial number of Device, When hosts find same devices, 
they are sorted, then hosts can distinguish one from another. 


4 Adventages
current network has a domain name for DNS mechanism, however unmanged
network is small and wants to configure very simply. Device ID is used 
the same as domain name, then unmanaged network doesn't require DNS 
mechanism for connectivity.
