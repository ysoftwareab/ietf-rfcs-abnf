                  draft-irtf-icnrg-ccnxmessages-08

Abstract

   This document specifies the encoding of CCNx messages in a TLV packet
   format, including the TLV types used by each message element and the
   encoding of each value.  The semantics of CCNx messages follow the
   encoding-independent CCNx Semantics specification.

   This document is a product of the Information Centric Networking
   research group (ICNRG).

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a Type-Length-Value (TLV) packet format and
   the TLV type and value encodings for CCNx messages.  A full
   description of the CCNx network protocol, providing an encoding-free
   description of CCNx messages and message elements, may be found in
   [CCNSemantics].  CCNx is a network protocol that uses a hierarchical
   name to forward requests and to match responses to requests.  It does
   not use endpoint addresses, such as Internet Protocol.  Restrictions
   in a request can limit the response by the public key of the
   response's signer or the cryptographic hash of the response.  Every
   CCNx forwarder along the path does the name matching and restriction
   checking.  The CCNx protocol fits within the broader framework of
   Information Centric Networking (ICN) protocols [RFC7927].

   This document describes a TLV scheme using a fixed 2-byte T and a
   fixed 2-byte L field.  The rational for this choice is described in
   Section 5.  Briefly, this choice avoids multiple encodings of the
   same value (aliases) and reduces the work of a validator to ensure
   compliance.  Unlike some uses of TLV in networking, the each network
   hop must evaluate the encoding, so even small validation latencies at
   each hop could add up to a large overall forwarding delay.  For very
   small packets or low throughput links, where the extra bytes may
   become a concern, one may use a TLV compression protocol, for example
   [compress] and [CCNxz].

   This document specifies:

   o  The TLV packet format.

   o  The overall packet format for CCNx messages.

   o  The TLV types used by CCNx messages.

   o  The encoding of values for each type.

   o  Top level types that exist at the outermost containment.

   o  Interest TLVs that exist within Interest containment.

   o  Content Object TLVs that exist within Content Object containment.

   This document is supplemented by this document:

   o  Message semantics: see [CCNSemantics] for the protocol operation
      regarding Interest and Content Object, including the Interest
      Return protocol.

   o  URI notation: see [CCNxURI] for the CCNx URI notation.

   The type values in Section 4 represent the values in common usage
   today.  These values may change pending IANA assignments.  All type
   values are relative to their parent containers.  For example, each
   level of a nested TLV structure might define a "type = 1" with a
   completely different meaning.  In the following, we use the symbolic
   names defined in that section.

   Packets are represented as 32-bit wide words using ASCII art.  Due to
   the nested levels of TLV encoding and the presence of optional fields
   and variable sizes, there is no concise way to represent all
   possibilities.  We use the convention that ASCII art fields enclosed
   by vertical bars "|" represent exact bit widths.  Fields with a
   forward slash "/" are variable bit widths, which we typically pad out
   to word alignment for picture readability.

   The document represents the consensus of the ICN RG.  It is the first
   ICN protocol from the RG, created from the early CCNx protocol [nnc]
   with significant revision and input from the ICN community and RG
   members.  The draft has received critical reading by several members
   of the ICN community and the RG.  The authors and RG chairs approve
   of the contents.  The document is sponsored under the IRTF and is not
   issued by the IETF and is not an IETF standard.  This is an
   experimental protocol and may not be suitable for any specific
   application and the specification may change in the future.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Definitions

   o  Name: A hierarchically structured variable length identifier.  It
      is an ordered list of path segments, which are variable length
      octet strings.  In human-readable form, it is represented in URI

      format as ccnx:/path/part.  There is no host or query string.  See
      [CCNxURI] for complete details.

   o  Interest: A message requesting a Content Object with a matching
      Name and other optional selectors to choose from multiple objects
      with the same Name.  Any Content Object with a Name and attributes
      that matches the Name and optional selectors of the Interest is
      said to satisfy the Interest.

   o  Content Object: A data object sent in response to an Interest
      request.  It has an optional Name and a content payload that are
      bound together via cryptographic means.

3.  Type-Length-Value (TLV) Packets

   We use 16-bit Type and 16-bit Length fields to encode TLV based
   packets.  This provides 64K different possible types and value field
   lengths of up to 64KiB.  With 64K possible types at each level of TLV
   encoding, there should be sufficient space for basic protocol types,
   while also allowing ample room for experimentation, application use,
   vendor extensions, and growth.  This encoding does not allow for
   jumbo packets beyond 64 KiB total length.  If used on a media that
   allows for jumbo frames, we suggest defining a media adapation
   envelope that allows for multiple smaller frames.

   There are several global TLV definitions that we reserve at all
   hierarchical contexts.  The TLV types in the range 0x1000 - 0x1FFF
   are reserved for experimental use.  The TLV type T_ORG is also
   reserved for vendor extensions ( see Section 3.3.2).  The TLV type
   T_PAD is used to optionally pad a field out to some desired
   alignment.

   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

   The Length field contains the length of the Value field in octets.
   It does not include the length of the Type and Length fields.  The
   length MAY be zero.

   TLV structures are nestable, allowing the Value field of one TLV
   structure to contain additional TLV structures.  The enclosing TLV
   structure is called the container of the enclosed TLV.

   Type values are context-dependent.  Within a TLV container, one may
   re-use previous type values for new context-dependent purposes.

3.1.  Overall packet format

   Each packet includes the 8 byte fixed header, described below,
   followed by a set of TLV fields.  These fields are optional hop-by-
   hop headers and the Packet Payload.

   The packet payload is a TLV encoding of the CCNx message, followed by
   optional Validation TLVs.

   This document describes the Version "1" TLV encoding.

   After discarding the fixed and hop-by-hop headers the remaining
   PacketPayload should be a valid protocol message.  Therefore, the
   PacketPayload always begins with 4 bytes of type-length that
   specifies the protocol message (whether it is an Interest, Content
   Object, or other message type) and its total length.  The embedding
   of a self-sufficient protocol data unit inside the fixed and hop-by-
   hop headers allows a network stack to discard the headers and operate
   only on the embedded message.  It also de-couples the PacketType
   field -- which specifies how to forward the packet -- from the
   PacketPayload.

   The range of bytes protected by the Validation includes the CCNx
   Message and the ValidationAlgorithm.

   The ContentObjectHash begins with the CCNx Message and ends at the
   tail of the packet.

3.2.  Fixed Headers

   CCNx messages begin with an 8 byte fixed header (non-TLV format).
   The HeaderLength field represents the combined length of the Fixed
   and Hop-by-hop headers.  The PacketLength field represents the entire
   Packet length from the first byte of Version to the last byte of the
   packet.

   A specific PacketType may assign meaning to the "PacketType specific
   fields," which are otherwise reserved.  For the three defined
   PacketTypes (Interest, ContentObject, and InterestReturn), we define
   those values in this document.

   The PacketPayload of a CCNx packet is the protocol message itself.
   The Content Object Hash is computed over the PacketPayload only,
   excluding the fixed and hop-by-hop headers as those might change from
   hop to hop.  Signed information or Similarity Hashes should not
   include any of the fixed or hop-by-hop headers.  The PacketPayload
   should be self-sufficient in the event that the fixed and hop-by-hop
   headers are removed.

   o  Version: defines the version of the packet.

   o  HeaderLength: The length of the fixed header (8 bytes) and hop-by-
      hop headers.  The minimum value MUST be "8".

   o  PacketType: describes forwarder actions to take on the packet.

   o  PacketLength: Total octets of packet including all headers (fixed
      header plus hop-by-hop headers) and protocol message.

   o  PacketType Specific Fields: specific PacketTypes define the use of
      these bits.

   The PacketType field indicates how the forwarder should process the
   packet.  A Request Packet (Interest) has PacketType PT_INTEREST, a
   Response (Content Object) has PacketType PT_CONTENT, and an
   InterestReturn has PacketType PT_RETURN.

   HeaderLength is the number of octets from the start of the packet
   (Version) to the end of the hop-by-hop headers.  PacketLength is the
   number of octets from the start of the packet to the end of the
   packet.  Both lengths have a minimum value of 8 (the fixed header
   itself).

   The PacketType specific fields are reserved bits whose use depends on
   the PacketType.  They are used for network-level signaling.

3.2.1.  Interest Fixed Header

   If the PacketType is PT_INTEREST, it indicates that the PacketPayload
   should be processed as an Interest message.  For this type of packet,
   the Fixed Header includes a field for a HopLimit as well as Reserved
   and Flags fields.  The Reserved field MUST be set to 0 in an Interest
   - this field will be set to a return code in the case of an Interest
   Return.  There are currently no Flags defined, so this field MUST be

3.2.1.1.  Interest HopLimit

   For an Interest message, the HopLimit is a counter that is
   decremented with each hop.  It limits the distance an Interest may
   travel on the network.  The node originating the Interest MAY put in
   any value - up to the maximum of 255.  Each node that receives an
   Interest with a HopLimit decrements the value upon reception.  If the
   value is 0 after the decrement, the Interest MUST NOT be forwarded
   off the node.

   It is an error to receive an Interest with a 0 hop-limit from a
   remote node.

3.2.2.  Content Object Fixed Header

   If the PacketType is PT_CONTENT, it indicates that the PacketPayload
   should be processed as a Content Object message.  A Content Object
   defines a Flags field, however there are currently no flags defined,
   so the Flags field must be set to 0.

   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

3.2.3.  InterestReturn Fixed Header

   If the PacketType is PT_RETURN, it indicates that the PacketPayload
   should be processed as a returned Interest message.  The only
   difference between this InterestReturn message and the original
   Interest is that the PacketType is changed to PT_RETURN and a
   ReturnCode is is put into the ReturnCode field.  All other fields are
   unchanged from the Interest packet.  The purpose of this encoding is
   to prevent packet length changes so no additional bytes are needed to
   return an Interest to the previous hop.  See [CCNSemantics] for a
   protocol description of this packet type.

3.2.3.1.  InterestReturn HopLimit

   This is the original Interest's HopLimit, as received.  It is the
   value before being decremented at the current node (i.e. the received
   value).

3.2.3.2.  InterestReturn Flags

   These are the original Flags as set in the Interest.

3.2.3.3.  Return Code

   The numeric value assigned to the return types is defined below.
   This value is set by the node creating the Interest Return.

   A return code of "0" MUST NOT be used, as it indicates that the
   returning system did not modify the Return Code field.

3.3.1.  Pad

   The pad type may be used by protocols that prefer word-aligned data.
   The size of the word may be defined by the protocol.  Padding 4-byte
   words, for example, would use a 1-byte, 2-byte, and 3-byte Length.
   Padding 8-byte words would use a (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7)-byte Length.

   One MUST NOT pad inside a Name.  Apart from that, a pad MAY be
   inserted after any other TLV in the CCNx Message or in the Validation
   Dependent Data In the remainder of this document, we will not show
   optional pad TLVs.

3.3.2.  Organization Specific TLVs

   Organization specific TLVs (also known as Vendor TLVs) MUST use the
   T_ORG type.  The Length field is the length of the organization
   specific information plus 3.  The Value begins with the 3 byte
   organization number derived from the last three digits of the IANA
   Private Enterprise Numbers [EpriseNumbers], followed by the
   organization specific information.

   A T_ORG MAY be used as a path segment in a Name, in which case it is
   a regular path segment and is part of the regular name matching.

3.3.3.  Hash Format

   Hash values are used in several fields throughout a packet.  This TLV
   encoding is commonly embedded inside those fields to specify the
   specific hash function used and it's value.  Note that the reserved




Mosko, et al.            Expires January 3, 2019               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                  CCNx TLV                       July 2018


   TLV types are also reserved here for user-defined experimental
   functions.

   The LENGTH field of the hash value MUST be less than or equal to the
   hash function length.  If the LENGTH is less than the full length, it
   is taken as the left LENGTH bytes of the hash function output.  Only
   specified truncations are allowed, not arbitrary truncations.

   This nested format is used because it allows binary comparison of
   hash values for certain fields without a router needing to understand
   a new hash function.  For example, the KeyIdRestriction is bit-wise
   compared between an Interest's KeyIdRestriction field and a
   ContentObject's KeyId field.  This format means the outer field
   values do not change with differing hash functions so a router can
   still identify those fields and do a binary comparison of the hash
   TLV without need to understand the specific hash used.  An
   alternative approach, such as using T_KEYID_SHA512-256, would require
   each router keep an up-to-date parser and supporting user-defined
   hash functions here would explode the parsing state-space.

   A CCNx entity MUST support the hash type T_SHA-256.  An entity MAY
   support the remaining hash types.

   A Link is the tuple: {Name, [KeyIdRestr], [ContentObjectHashRestr]}.
   It is a general encoding that is used in both the payload of a
   Content Object with PayloadType = "Link" and in the KeyLink field in
   a KeyLocator.  A Link is essentially the body of an Interest.

3.4.1.  Interest Lifetime

   The Interest Lifetime is the time that an Interest should stay
   pending at an intermediate node.  It is expressed in milliseconds as
   an unsigned, network byte order integer.

   A value of 0 (encoded as 1 byte %x00) indicates the Interest does not
   elicit a Content Object response.  It should still be forwarded, but
   no reply is expected and a forwarder could skip creating a PIT entry.

   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

3.4.2.  Recommended Cache Time

   The Recommended Cache Time (RCT) is a measure of the useful lifetime
   of a Content Object as assigned by a content producer or upstream
   node.  It serves as a guideline to the Content Store cache in
   determining how long to keep the Content Object.  It is a
   recommendation only and may be ignored by the cache.  This is in
   contrast to the ExpiryTime (described in Section 3.6.2.2.2) which
   takes precedence over the RCT and must be obeyed.

   Because the Recommended Cache Time is an optional hop-by-hop header
   and not a part of the signed message, a content producer may re-issue
   a previously signed Content Object with an updated RCT without
   needing to re-sign the message.  There is little ill effect from an
   attacker changing the RCT as the RCT serves as a guideline only.

   The Recommended Cache Time (a millisecond timestamp) is a network
   byte ordered unsigned integer of the number of milliseconds since the
   epoch in UTC of when the payload expires.  It is a 64-bit field.

3.4.3.  Message Hash

   Within a trusted domain, an operator may calculate the message hash
   at a border device and insert that value into the hop-by-hop headers
   of a message.  An egress device should remove the value.  This
   permits intermediate devices within that trusted domain to match
   against a ContentObjectHashRestriction without calculating it at
   every hop.

   The message hash is a cryptographic hash from the start of the CCNx
   Message to the end of the packet.  It is used to match against the
   ContentObjectHashRestriction (Section 3.6.2.1.2).  The Message Hash
   may be of longer length than an Interest's restriction, in which case
   the device should use the left bytes of the Message Hash to check
   against the Interest's value.

   The Message Hash may only carry one hash type and there may only be
   one Message Hash header.

   The Message Hash header is unprotected, so this header is only of
   practical use within a trusted domain, such as an operator's

3.6.  CCNx Message

   This is the format for the CCNx protocol message itself.  The CCNx
   message is the portion of the packet between the hop-by-hop headers
   and the Validation TLVs.  The figure below is an expansion of the
   "CCNx Message TLV" depicted in the beginning of Section 3.  The CCNx
   message begins with MessageType and runs through the optional
   Payload.  The same general format is used for both Interest and
   Content Object messages which are differentiated by the MessageType
   field.  The first enclosed TLV of a CCNx Message is always the Name
   TLV.  This is followed by an optional Message TLVs and an optional
   Payload TLV.

3.6.1.  Name

   A Name is a TLV encoded sequence of segments.  The table below lists
   the type values appropriate for these Name segments.  A Name MUST NOT
   include PAD TLVs.

   As described in CCNx Semantics [CCNSemantics], using the CCNx URI
   [CCNxURI] notation, a T_NAME with 0 length corresponds to ccnx:/ (the
   default route) and is distinct from a name with one zero length
   segment, such as ccnx:/NAME=.  In the TLV encoding, ccnx:/
   corresponds to T_NAME with 0 length, while ccnx:/NAME= corresponds to
   T_NAME with 4 length and T_NAMESEGMENT with 0 length.

3.6.1.1.  Name Segments

   4096 special application payload name segments are allocated.  These
   have application semantics applied to them.  A good convention is to
   put the application's identity in the name prior to using these name
   segments.

   For example, a name like "ccnx:/foo/bar/hi" would be encoded as:

3.6.1.2.  Interest Payload ID

   The InterestPayloadID is a name segment created by the origin of an
   Interest to represent the Interest Payload.  This allows the proper
   multiplexing of Interests based on their name if they have different
   payloads.  A common representation is to use a hash of the Interest
   Payload as the InterestPayloadID.

   As part of the TLV 'value', the InterestPayloadID contains a one
   identifier of method used to create the InterestPayloadID followed by
   a variable length octet string.  An implementation is not required to
   implement any of the methods to receive an Interest; the
   InterestPayloadID may be treated only as an opaque octet string for
   purposes of multiplexing Interests with different payloads.  Only a
   device creating an InterestPayloadID name segment or a device
   verifying such a segment need to implement the algorithms.

   It uses the Section 3.3.3 encoding of hash values.

   In normal operations, we recommend displaying the InterestPayloadID
   as an opaque octet string in a CCNx URI, as this is the common
   denominator for implementation parsing.

   The InterestPayloadID, even if it is a hash, should not convey any
   security context.  If a system requires confirmation that a specific
   entity created the InterestPayload, it should use a cryptographic
   signature on the Interest via the ValidationAlgorithm and
   ValidationPayload or use its own methods inside the Interest Payload.

3.6.2.  Message TLVs

   Each message type (Interest or Content Object) is associated with a
   set of optional Message TLVs.  Additional specification documents may
   extend the types associated with each.

3.6.2.1.  Interest Message TLVs

   There are two Message TLVs currently associated with an Interest
   message: the KeyIdRestriction selector and the ContentObjectHashRestr
   selector are used to narrow the universe of acceptable Content
   Objects that would satisfy the Interest.

3.6.2.1.1.  KeyIdRestriction

   An Interest MAY include a KeyIdRestriction selector.  This ensures
   that only Content Objects with matching KeyIds will satisfy the
   Interest.  See Section 3.6.4.1.4.1 for the format of a KeyId.

3.6.2.1.2.  ContentObjectHashRestriction

   An Interest MAY contain a ContentObjectHashRestriction selector.
   This is the hash of the Content Object - the self-certifying name
   restriction that must be verified in the network, if an Interest
   carried this restriction.  It is calculated from the beginning of the
   CCNx Message to the end of the packet.  The LENGTH MUST be from one
   of the allowed values for that hash (see Section 3.3.3).

   The ContentObjectHashRestriction SHOULD be of type T_SHA-256 and of
   length 32 bytes.

              Table 9: CCNx Content Object Message TLV Types

3.6.2.2.1.  PayloadType

   The PayloadType is a network byte order integer representing the
   general type of the Payload TLV.

   o  T_PAYLOADTYPE_DATA: Data (possibly encrypted)

   o  T_PAYLOADTYPE_KEY: Key

   o  T_PAYLOADTYPE_LINK: Link

   The Data type indicate that the Payload of the ContentObject is
   opaque application bytes.  The Key type indicates that the Payload is
   a DER encoded public key.  The Link type indicates that the Payload
   is one or more Link (Section 3.3.4).  If this field is missing, a
   "Data" type is assumed.

3.6.2.2.2.  ExpiryTime

   The ExpiryTime is the time at which the Payload expires, as expressed
   by a timestamp containing the number of milliseconds since the epoch
   in UTC.  It is a network byte order unsigned integer in a 64-bit
   field.  A cache or end system should not respond with a Content
   Object past its ExpiryTime.  Routers forwarding a Content Object do

   not need to check the ExpiryTime.  If the ExpiryTime field is
   missing, the Content Object has no expressed expiration and a cache
   or end system may use the Content Object for as long as desired.

3.6.3.  Payload

   The Payload TLV contains the content of the packet.  It MAY be of
   zero length.  If a packet does not have any payload, this field MAY
   be omitted, rather than carrying a zero length.

3.6.4.  Validation

   Both Interests and Content Objects have the option to include
   information about how to validate the CCNx message.  This information
   is contained in two TLVs: the ValidationAlgorithm TLV and the
   ValidationPayload TLV.  The ValidationAlgorithm TLV specifies the
   mechanism to be used to verify the CCNx message.  Examples include
   verification with a Message Integrity Check (MIC), a Message
   Authentication Code (MAC), or a cryptographic signature.  The
   ValidationPayload TLV contains the validation output, such as the
   CRC32C code or the RSA signature.

   An Interest would most likely only use a MIC type of validation - a
   crc, checksum, or digest.

3.6.4.1.  Validation Algorithm

   The ValidationAlgorithm is a set of nested TLVs containing all of the
   information needed to verify the message.  The outermost container
   has type = T_VALIDATION_ALG.  The first nested TLV defines the
   specific type of validation to be performed on the message.  The type

   is identified with the "ValidationType" as shown in the figure below
   and elaborated in the table below.  Nested within that container are
   the TLVs for any ValidationType dependent data, for example a Key Id,
   Key Locator etc.

   Complete examples of several types may be found in Section 3.6.4.1.5

3.6.4.1.1.  Message Integrity Checks

   MICs do not require additional data in order to perform the
   verification.  An example is CRC32C that has a "0" length value.

3.6.4.1.2.  Message Authentication Checks

   MACs are useful for communication between two trusting parties who
   have already shared private keys.  Examples include an RSA signature
   of a SHA256 digest or others.  They rely on a KeyId.  Some MACs might
   use more than a KeyId, but those would be defined in the future.

3.6.4.1.3.  Signature

   Signature type Validators specify a digest mechanism and a signing
   algorithm to verify the message.  Examples include RSA signature og a
   SHA256 digest, an Elliptic Curve signature with SECP-256K1
   parameters, etc.  These Validators require a KeyId and a mechanism
   for locating the publishers public key (a KeyLocator) - optionally a
   PublicKey or Certificate or KeyLink.

3.6.4.1.4.  Validation Dependent Data

   Different Validation Algorithms require access to different pieces of
   data contained in the ValidationAlgorithm TLV.  As described above,
   Key Ids, Key Locators, Public Keys, Certificates, Links and Key Names
   all play a role in different Validation Algorithms.  Any number of
   Validation Dependent Data containers can be present in a Validation
   Algorithm TLV.

   Following is a table of CCNx ValidationType dependent data types:

3.6.4.1.4.1.  KeyId

   The KeyId is the publisher key identifier.  It is similar to a
   Subject Key Identifier from X509 [RFC 5280, Section 4.2.1.2].  It
   should be derived from the key used to sign, such as from the SHA-256
   hash of the key.  It applies to both public/private key systems and
   to symmetric key systems.

   The KeyId is represented using the Section 3.3.3.  If a protocol uses
   a non-hash identifier, it should use one of the reserved values.

   A Public Key is a DER encoded Subject Public Key Info block, as in an
   X509 certificate.

3.6.4.1.4.4.  KeyLink

   A KeyLink type KeyLocator is a Link.

   The KeyLink ContentObjectHashRestr, if included, is the digest of the
   Content Object identified by KeyLink, not the digest of the public
   key.  Likewise, the KeyIdRestr of the KeyLink is the KeyId of the
   ContentObject, not necessarily of the wrapped key.

3.6.4.1.4.5.  SignatureTime

   The SignatureTime is a millisecond timestamp indicating the time at
   which a signature was created.  The signer sets this field to the
   current time when creating a signature.  A verifier may use this time
   to determine whether or not the signature was created during the
   validity period of a key, or if it occurred in a reasonable sequence
   with other associated signatures.  The SignatureTime is unrelated to

   any time associated with the actual CCNx Message, which could have
   been created long before the signature.  The default behavior is to
   always include a SignatureTime when creating an authenticated message
   (e.g.  HMAC or RSA).

   SignatureTime is a network byte ordered unsigned integer of the
   number of milliseconds since the epoch in UTC of when the signature
   was created.  It is a fixed 64-bit field.

3.6.4.1.5.  Validation Examples

   As an example of a MIC type validation, the encoding for CRC32C
   validation would be:

                        1                   2                   3

   As an example of a MAC type validation, the encoding for an HMAC
   using a SHA256 hash would be:

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section details each kind of protocol value that can be
   registered.  Each type registry can be updated by incrementally
   expanding the type space, i.e., by allocating and reserving new
   types.  As per [RFC5226] this section details the creation of the
   "CCNx Registry" and several sub-registries.

5.  Security Considerations

   The CCNx protocol is a layer 3 network protocol, which may also
   operate as an overlay using other transports, such as UDP or other
   tunnels.  It includes intrinsic support for message authentication
   via a signature (e.g.  RSA or elliptic curve) or message
   authentication code (e.g.  HMAC).  In lieu of an authenticator, it
   may instead use a message integrity check (e.g.  SHA or CRC).  CCNx
   does not specify an encryption envelope, that function is left to a
   high-layer protocol (e.g. [esic]).

   The CCNx message format includes the ability to attach MICs (e.g.
   SHA-256 or CRC), MACs (e.g.  HMAC), and Signatures (e.g.  RSA or
   ECDSA) to all packet types.  This does not mean that it is a good
   idea to use an arbitrary ValidationAlgorithm, nor to include
   computationally expensive algorithms in Interest packets, as that
   could lead to computational DoS attacks.  Applications should use an
   explicit protocol to guide their use of packet signatures.  As a

Internet-Draft                  CCNx TLV                       July 2018


   general guideline, an application might use a MIC on an Interest to
   detect unintentionally corrupted packets.  If one wishes to secure an
   Interest, one should consider using an encrypted wrapper and a
   protocol that prevents replay attacks, especially if the Interest is
   being used as an actuator.  Simply using an authentication code or
   signature does not make an Interests secure.  There are several
   examples in the literature on how to secure ICN-style messaging
   [mobile] [ace].

   As a layer 3 protocol, this document does not describe how one
   arrives at keys or how one trusts keys.  The CCNx content object may
   include a public key embedded in the object or may use the
   PublicKeyLocator field to point to a public key (or public key
   certificate) that authenticates the message.  One key exchange
   specification is CCNxKE [ccnxke]  [mobile], which is similar to the
   TLS 1.3 key exchange except it is over the CCNx layer 3 messages.
   Trust is beyond the scope of a layer-3 protocol protocol and left to
   applications or application frameworks.

   The combination of an ephemeral key exchange (e.g.  CCNxKE [ccnxke])
   and an encapsulating encryption (e.g. [esic]) provides the equivalent
   of a TLS tunnel.  Intermediate nodes may forward the Interests and
   Content Objects, but have no visibility inside.  It also completely
   hides the internal names in those used by the encryption layer.  This
   type of tunneling encryption is useful for content that has little or
   no cache-ability as it can only be used by someone with the ephemeral
   key.  Short term caching may help with lossy links or mobility, but
   long term caching is usually not of interest.

   Broadcast encryption or proxy re-encryption may be useful for content
   with multiple uses over time or many consumers.  There is currently
   no recommendation for this form of encryption.

   The specific encoding of messages will have security implications.
   This document uses a type-length-value (TLV) encoding.  We chose to
   compromise between extensibility and unambiguous encodings of types
   and lengths.  Some TLVs use variable length T and variable length L
   fields to accomodate a wide gamut of values while trying to be byte-
   efficient.  Our TLV encoding uses a fixed length 2-byte T and 2-byte
   L.  Using a fixed-length T and L field solves two problems.  The
   first is aliases.  If one is able to encode the same value, such as
   0x2 and 0x02, in different byte lengths then one must decide if they
   mean the same thing, if they are different, or if one is illegal.  If
   they are different, then one must always compare on the buffers not
   the integer equivalents.  If one is illegal, then one must validate
   the TLV encoding -- every field of every packet at every hop.  If
   they are the same, then one has the second problem: how to specify
   packet filters.  For example, if a name has 6 name components, then



Mosko, et al.            Expires January 3, 2019               [Page 40]

Internet-Draft                  CCNx TLV                       July 2018


   there are 7 T's and 7 L's, each of which might have up to 4
   representations of the same value.  That would be 14 fields with 4
   encodings each, or 1001 combinations.  It also means that one cannot
   compare, for example, a name via a memory function as one needs to
   consider that any embedded T or L might have a different format.

   The Interest Return message has no authenticator from the previous
   hop.  Therefore, the payload of the Interest Return should only be
   used locally to match an Interest.  A node should never forward that
   Interest payload as an Interest.  It should also verify that it sent
   the Interest in the Interest Return to that node and not allow anyone
   to negate Interest messages.

   Caching nodes must take caution when processing content objects.  It
   is essential that the Content Store obey the rules outlined in
   [CCNSemantics] to avoid certain types of attacks.  Unlike NDN, CCNx
   1.0 has no mechanism to work around an undesired result from the
   network (there are no "excludes"), so if a cache becomes poisoned
   with bad content it might cause problems retrieving content.  There
   are three types of access to content from a content store:
   unrestricted, signature restricted, and hash restricted.  If an
   Interest has no restrictions, then the requester is not particular
   about what they get back, so any matching cached object is OK.  In
   the hash restricted case, the requester is very specific about what
   they want and the content store (and every forward hop) can easily
   verify that the content matches the request.  In the signature
   verified case (often used for initial manifest discovery), the
   requester only knows the KeyId that signed the content.  It is this
   case that requires the closest attention in the content store to
   avoid amplifying bad data.  The content store must only respond with
   a content object if it can verify the signature -- this means either
   the content object carries the public key inside it or the Interest
   carries the public key in addition to the KeyId.  If that is not the
   case, then the content store should treat the Interest as a cache
   miss and let an endpoint respond.

   A user-level cache could perform full signature verification by
   fetching a public key according to the PublicKeyLocator.  That is
   not, however, a burden we wish to impose on the forwarder.  A user-
   level cache could also rely on out-of-band attestation, such as the
   cache operator only inserting content that it knows has the correct
   signature.

   The CCNx grammar allows for hash algorithm agility via the HashType.
   It specifies a short list of acceptable hash algorithms that should
   be implemented at each forwarder.  Some hash values only apply to end
   systems, so updating the hash algorithm does not affect forwarders --
   they would simply match the buffer that includes the type-length-hash

   buffer.  Some fields, such as the ConObjHash, must be verified at
   each hop, so a forwarder (or related system) must know the hash
   algorithm and it could cause backward compatibility problems if the
   hash type is updated.

   A CCNx name uses binary matching whereas a URI uses a case
   insensitive hostname.  Some systems may also use case insensitive
   matching of the URI path to a resource.  An implication of this is
   that human-entered CCNx names will likely have case or non-ASCII
   symbol mismatches unless one uses a consistent URI normalization to
   the CCNx name.  It also means that an entity that registers a CCNx
   routable prefix, say ccnx:/example.com, would need separate
   registrations for simple variations like ccnx:/Example.com.  Unless
   this is addressed in URI normalization and routing protocol
   conventions, there could be phishing attacks.

   approaches, see [RFC7927] and [RFC7945]
