1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [12]. 
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB 
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [7], STD 58, RFC 2579 [8] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [9].

2. Glossary 
    
   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable 
   system usage, from normal residential gateway operation, or from the 
   documents associated with the CableHome Specifications [21]. 
       
2.1 CableHome Residential Gateway 
    
   A CableHome Residential gateway passes data traffic between the cable 
   operator's broadband data network (the Wide Area Network, WAN) and 
   the Local Area Network (LAN) in the cable data service subscriber's 
   residence or business. In addition to passing traffic between the WAN 
   and LAN, the CableHome Residential Gateway provides several services 
   including a DHCP client and a DHCP server (RFC2131) [22], a TFTP 
   server (RFC1350) [23], management services as enabled by 
   SNMPv1/v2c/v3 agent compliant with the RFCs listed in Section 1, and 
   security services including stateful packet inspection firewall 
   functionality and software code image verification using techniques. 
    
2.2 Portal Services 
    
   A logical element aggregating the set of CableHome-specified 
   functionality in a CableHome compliant cable gateway device. 
    
    
2.3 LAN IP Device  
        
   A LAN IP Device is representative of a typical IP device expected to 
   reside on home networks, and is assumed to contain a TCP/IP stack as 
   well as a DHCP client. 
    
2.4 WAN Management (WAN-Man) Address  
        
   WAN Management Addresses are intended for network management traffic 
   on the cable network between the network management system and the PS 
   element. Typically, these addresses will reside in private IP address 
   space.  
        
2.5 WAN Data (WAN-Data) Address  
        
   WAN Data Addresses are intended for subscriber application traffic on 
   the cable network and beyond, such as traffic between LAN IP Devices 
   and Internet hosts. Typically, these addresses will reside in public 
   IP address space.  
        
2.6 LAN Translated (LAN-Trans) Address

Internet-Draft       CableHome Gateway Device MIB            June 2003 
 
   LAN Translated Addresses are intended for subscriber application and 
   management traffic on the home network between LAN IP Devices and the 
   PS element. Typically, these addresses will reside in private IP 
   address space, and can typically be reused across subscribers. 
    
2.7 LAN Passthrough (LAN-Pass) Address  
     
   LAN Passthrough Addresses are intended for subscriber application 
   traffic, such as traffic between LAN IP Devices and Internet hosts, 
   on the home network, the cable network, and beyond. Typically, these 
   addresses will reside in public IP address space.  
        
2.8 Cable Gateway DHCP Portal (CDP) 
 
   A logical element residing within the PS that encapsulates DHCP 
   functionality within a Cable Gateway Device. This includes both DHCP 
   client as well as DHCP server capabilities. 
    
    
    
3. Overview 
    
   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of 
   CableHome compliant residential gateway (RG) devices.  The 
   specification is derived from the CableHome Specification [21]. 
 
 
    
3.1 Structure of the MIB 
    
   Two MIBs are included in this Internet-Draft.  The first, CABH-DEV-
   MIB, is a stub under which the following CableHome MIBs are grouped: 
    
   draft-jones-cable-gateway-addressing-mib-01 
   draft-jones-cable-gateway-config-mib-01 
   draft-jones-cable-gateway-device-mib-01 
   draft-jones-cable-gateway-security-mib-01 
   draft-jones-cable-gateway-qos-mib-00 
   draft-jones-cable-gateway-tools-mib-01 
    
    
    
   The second MIB, CABH-PS-DEV-MIB, contains the set of objects to 
   manage a CableHome Residential Gateway Device.  This MIB is 
   structured into three groups and is described in the remainder of 
   this section: 
     
  û The cabhPsDevBase group extends the CableLabs projects-CableHome 
     group with objects needed to implement and configure the CableHome 
     Portal Services set of functions.

Internet-Draft       CableHome Gateway Device MIB            June 2003 
 
 
  û The cabhPsDevProv Group provides objects allowing the manager to 
     configure residential gateway device provisioning parameters. 
   
  û The cabhPsNotification group provides SNMP notification objects for 
     the reporting of Portal Services status and exception conditions. 
    
    
3.2 Management Requirements  
 
3.2.1.  Portal Services device-specific parameters 
 
   The PsDevBase group consists largely of read-only parameters 
   providing information specific to the device, primarily for 
   identification purposes. By reading these parameters the device 
   manager can gain unique identification information about the cable 
   gateway device in which the Portal Services set of functions resides. 
    
   In addition to device-specific identification parameters the 
   PsDevBase group provides device-specific provisioning and operating 
   parameters such as the current date and time and time of day 
   synchronization status indicator. 
    
   The PsDevBase group also includes manager-controlled parameters 
   enabling the reset of the Portal Services functionality and enabling 
   the reset of cable gateway device MIB objects to their default values 
   without resetting all Portal Services functionality. 
       
3.2.2 Portal Services provisioning parameters 
 
   The second group of OIDs in the Cable Gateway Device MIB, the 
   PsDevProv group, includes parameters required by Portal Services 
   functions that are responsible for provisioning processes, 
   particularly the Portal Services configuration file download 
   processes. 
    
   The provisioning process, described in Section 13 of [21], is timed 
   so that it does not get stuck waiting for a failed process to 
   complete. The timeout value for the provisioning process is 
   configurable by the manager but has a default value of 5 minutes. 
    
   When the Portal Services is configured to operate in the DHCP 
   Provisioning mode as described in Section 5.5 and Section 7.1.1 of 
   [21], it is required to download via TFTP a file containing zero or 
   more configuration parameters. The name in URL format and location of 
   this configuration file are passed to the Portal Services in a DHCP 
   Option field. The file name and location are stored in PsDevProv 
   objects for retrieval by the manager using the management messaging 
   interface between the manager's console and the Portal Services 
   element. Also stored are the length of the configuration file and the

Internet-Draft       CableHome Gateway Device MIB            June 2003 
 
   number of Type-Length-Value (TLV) fields passed in the configuration 
   file, and the number of those TLV fields that were rejected by the 
   configuration file processing function. These parameters allow the 
   manager to verify that configuration parameters he or she passed to 
   the Portal Services element were received and processed correctly. 
    
   Integrity of the Portal Services configuration file is verified 
   through the use of a SHA-1 hash value. This process is described in 
   Section 7.3.3.3.1 in [21]. The hash value used to verify the 
   integrity of the configuration file is stored and is accessible to 
   the manager via an object of the PsDevProv group. 
    
   The PsDevProv group also includes status parameters such as an 
   indication about the progress of the provisioning process, the 
   configuration file name and location (URL format), hash value for 
   configuration file integrity checking, and the size of the 
   configuration file. The PsDevProv group also includes statistics for 
   tracking the number of Type-Length-Value (TLV) fields passed in the 
   PS configuration file and whether those TLVs were processed or 
   rejected. This group also contains objects for keeping track of 
   whether the file was authenticated, and an object to store the 
   timeout value for the authentication process key exchange. 
 
   The location of the Time of Day server, passed from the cable data 
   network DHCP server to the Portal Services element in a DHCP option 
   code, is stored by the Portal Services and accessible to the manager 
   via an object in the PsDevProv group. 
          
3.2.3. Portal Services Notification objects 
 
   The Portal Services element is required to report about exception 
   conditions that occur as well as to report on the status of certain 
   parameters. CableHome specifications defines four ways to report 
   these events: SNMP trap as defined in RFC3416 [18] or SNMP 
   notification described in RFC3411 [13] and RFC3412 [14], reporting to 
   a SYSLOG server, writing to a volatile local log, or writing to a 
   nonvolatile local log. Local log information is accessible to the 
   manager via the DOCSIS device MIB, RFC2669 [24]. The CableHome event 
   reporting process is described in Section 6.5 of [21], and defined 
   events are listed in Appendix II Format and Content for Event, SYSLOG 
   and SNMP Trap, in the same reference.

6. Formal Syntax 
    
    
   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur 
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [3]. 
    
    
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and 
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
   them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide 
   features for such a secure environment. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects 
   in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as 
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
