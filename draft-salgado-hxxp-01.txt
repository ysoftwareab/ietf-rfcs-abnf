Abstract

   This document describes the "hxxp" and "hxxps" URI schemes, which are
   widely used by the security community to obfuscate an http or https
   URI to avoid being accidentaly interpreted and loaded by a web
   browser or user-agent.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the "hxxp" and "hxxps" URI schemes, which are
   widely used by the security community to obfuscate an http or https
   URI to avoid being accidentaly interpreted and loaded by a web
   browser or user-agent.

   These schemes are used in case the resource is dangerous and there is
   security risks on being automatically processed by an application,
   such a pre-loading mechanism in web user agents.  It also prevents
   the creation of "clickables" areas in user interfaces, which could
   detect http or https URIs automatically.

   The purpose of this registration is to document its use, prevent any
   registration of this scheme in the future, explicitly recommend to
   web application developers to never act with this URI schemes in any
   way, and provide a safe method for the security community to share
   malicious information.  These schemes must not be treated as an http
   or https schemes, and must not be identified as web resources.  Its
   consumption is only for humans and documentation, and should be
   handled with caution by security professionals.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft     The "hxxp" and "hxxps" URI Schemes           May 2017


2.  URI Scheme Specification

2.1.  URI Scheme Syntax

   The "hxxp" URI syntactically conforms to the <hxxp-uri> rule below,
   expressed using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234]:


        hxxp-uri = "hxxp:" hxxp-token [ hxxp-query ] [ hxxp-fragment ]
        hxxp-token = *pchar
        hxxp-query = "?" query
        hxxp-fragment = "#" fragment
        pchar     = <as specified in RFC 3986, Appendix A>
        query     = <as specified in RFC 3986, Appendix A>
        fragment  = <as specified in RFC 3986, Appendix A>


   The "hxxps" URI syntactically conforms to the <hxxps-uri> rule below,
   expressed using the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234]:


     hxxps-uri = "hxxps:" hxxps-token [ hxxps-query ] [ hxxps-fragment ]
     hxxps-token = *pchar
     hxxps-query = "?" query
     hxxps-fragment = "#" fragment
     pchar     = <as specified in RFC 3986, Appendix A>
     query     = <as specified in RFC 3986, Appendix A>
     fragment  = <as specified in RFC 3986, Appendix A>


2.2.  URI Scheme Semantics

   The resource that is referenced by a particular "hxxp" or "hxxps" URI
   is NOT meant to be interpreted or parsed in any way for applications,
   or any automated means.  The resource MUST be interpreted and
   consumed by human security professionals.

2.3.  Encoding Considerations

   "hxxp" and "hxxps" URIs are subject to encoding rules as defined in
   RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

3.  Acknowledgements

   The author acknowledges the suggestions and comments made by Fernando
   Gont and Harlan Lieberman-Berg, for the first revision.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  URI Scheme Registration

   The IANA is requested to register "hxxp" and "hxxps" URI schemes in
   the "Provisional URI Schemes" registry.  The information below is
   provided according to the guidelines from RFC 7595 [RFC7595]:

   -----

   Scheme name: hxxp

   Status: Provisional

   Applications/protocols that use this scheme name: "hxxp" URIs are
   forbidden to be used by applications.

   Change controller: Hugo Salgado <hsalgado@nic.cl>

5.  Security Considerations

   As stated in the Introduction, the "hxxp" and "hxxps" schemes are
   forbidden to be used or interpreted by applications.  These schemes
   must be consumed only by humans.

   Application developers are encouraged to forbid "hxxp" and "hxxps"
   schemes URIs inside HTML anchors or tags.
