               Updating the IANA MPLS LSP Ping Parameters
             draft-ietf-mpls-lsp-ping-registries-update-03

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 8029 and RFC 8611 that both define IANA
   registries for MPLS LSP Ping.  It also updates the description of the
   procedures for the responses sent when an unknown or erroneous code
   point is found.  The updates are to clarify and align this name space
   with recent developments.

1.  Introduction

   When RFC 8029 [RFC8029] was published it contained updates to the
   "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
   Ping Parameters" IANA name space [IANA-LSP-PING].

   RFC 8611 [RFC8611] updated the LSP Ping IANA registries to match RFC
   8029.  This document further clarifies the entries in those
   registries and makes the definitions more precise.

   This document updates RFC 8029 [[RFC8029] and RFC 8611 [RFC8611] by
   updating two groups of registries as follows:






Andersson, et al.       Expires February 18, 2021               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries               August 2020


   First the registries for Message Types [IANA-MT], Reply Modes
   [IANA-RM] and Return Codes [IANA-RC] are updated.  The changes to
   these registries are minor.

   Second, this document updates the TLV and sub-TLV registries.

   o  TLVs [IANA-TLV-reg]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLVs 1, 16 and 21 [IANA-Sub-1-16-21]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 6 [IANA-Sub-6]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 11 [IANA-Sub-11]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 20 [IANA-Sub-20]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 23 [IANA-Sub-23]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 27 [IANA-Sub-27]

   The registry for sub-TLVs for TLV 9 [IANA-Sub-9] is not updated.

   Third, some code points (TLVs and sub-TLVs) are "mandatory" or
   "optional".  Contrary to how other RFCs use these words, indicating
   that it is mandatory or optional to include the code points in a
   message, RFC 8029 use the words to indicate that an action might or
   might not be necessary.  This document drops the words "mandatory and
   "optional" and the text is changed to focus on what should be done.

1.1.  Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Updating the Message Types, Reply Mode and Return Codes Registries

   The following changes are made to the Message Types, Reply Modes and
   Return Codes [IANA-MT] registries.

   o  in the listing of assiged code points the term "Vendor Private
      Use" is changed to "Private Use".

   o  the registration procedure "Specification Required" is changed to
      "RFC Required" and the note "Experimental RFC needed" is removed




Andersson, et al.       Expires February 18, 2021               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries               August 2020


   o  a small set of code points (4 code points) for Experimental Use is
      added by reducing the range for "RFC Required" range.

   o  the registration procedures "Private Use" and "Experimental Use"
      are added to the table of registration procedures

   o  A note "Not to be assigned" is added for the registration
      procedures "Private Use" and "Experimental Use"

   o  In the lists that capture the assignment status, the fields that
      are reserved, i.e.  0 (zero), Private Use and Experimental Use are
      clearly marked as such.

      *  In the Return Codes [IANA-RC] [IANA-RC] registry the code point
         "0" has already been assigned.  This assignment is not changed
         and in this registry the code point "0" continues to be
         assigned as "No Return Code".

   The new Registration Procedures, the registry layouts and the new
   assignments for these registries will be found in Section 6.1.

3.  Updating the TLV and sub-TLV registries

3.1.  General principles the LSP Ping TLV and sub-TLV registries

   The following principles are valid for all the LSP Ping TLV and sub-
   TLV IANA registries

   o  all TLVs and sub-TLVs with a type in the range 0-32767 require a
      response if they are not recognized

   o  all TLVs and sub-TLVs in the range 32768-65535 may be silently
      dropped if they are not recognized

   The range of each TLV and sub-TLV registry is divided into two
   blocks, one with a range from 0 to 32767 for TLVs and sub-TLVs that
   require a response if not recognized.  The other block in the range
   from 32768 to 65535 for TLVs and sub-TLVs that may be silently
   dropped, possibly stepped over, if not recognized.

   Each of the blocks has code point spaces with the following
   registration procedures:

   o  Standards Action

   o  RFC Required

   o  Experimental Use



Andersson, et al.       Expires February 18, 2021               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries               August 2020


   o  First come, first served (FCFS)

   The exact defintions of these procedures are found in [RFC8126]

3.1.1.  Unrecognized Experimental Use TLVs and sub-TLVs

   Unrecognized TLVs and sub-TLVs in the Experimetal Use, and FCFS
   ranges are handled as any other unrecognized TLV or sub-TLV.

   o  If the unrecognized TLV or sub-TLV is from the Experimental Use
      range (37140-37143) or from the FCFS range (31744-32767) a the
      Return Code of 2 ("One or more of the TLVs was not understood")
      will be sent in the echo response.

   o  If the unrecognized TLV or sub-TLV is from the Experimental Use
      range (64508-64511) or from the Private Use range (64512-65535)
      the TLVs SHOULD be silently ignored and possibly be stepped over.

   IETF does not prescribe how recognized or unrecognized Experimental
   Use and Private Use TLVs and sub-TLVs are handled in experimental or
   private networks, that is up to the agency running the experiment or
   the private network.  The statement above describes how standards
   compliant implementations will treat the unrecognized TLVs and sub-
   TLVs from these ranges.

3.2.  Changes to the LSP Ping Registries

   This section lists the changes to each MPLS LSP Ping TLV and sub-TLV
   Registry.  Section 6.1, Section 6.2 and Section 6.3 outline how the
   new versions of the IANA registries should look, together with the
   registration procedures for each registry.

3.2.1.  Common Changes to the TLV and sub-TLV Registries

   The following changes are made to the TLV and sub-TLV registries.

   o  the registration procedures "First Come Frst Served (FCFS)" and
      "Experimental Use" are added to the table of registration
      procedures

   o  two small sets of code points (4 code points each) for
      Experiemental Use are created.  The first set are for the range
      that requires a response if the TLV or sub-TLV is not recognised;
      the sedond set are for the range there the TLV or sub-TLV that MAY
      be silently dropped if not recognized.  The code points for
      experimental use are actually taken from the two ranges now called
      "RFC Required".

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries               August 2020


   o  the registration procedure "Specification Required" is changed to
      "RFC Required" and the note "Experimental RFC needed" is removed

   o  In the listing of assignments the term "Vendor Private Use" is
      changed to "First Come First Served (FCFS)"

   o  In the listing of assignments the range for "Experimental Use" is
      added

   o  A note saying "Not to be assigned" is added for the registration
      procedures "Experimental Use"

   o  In the list that capture assignment status, the fields that are
      reserved, i.e.  0 (zero) and Experimental Use are clearly marked.

   The new Registration Procedures description and the new assignments
   for these registries are shown in Section 6.2 and Section 6.3.

4.  Updates to Related RFCs

   Some referenced RFCs are using the concept "mandatory TLVs" and
   "mandatory sub-TLVs" to indicate that, if a TLV or sub-TLV of the
   range 0-16383 or 16384-31743 in a message is not understood, an error
   message needs to be sent in response.

   The same RFCs use "optional TLVs" and "optional sub-TLVs" to mean
   TLVs or sub-TLVs that can be silently ignored if not recognized.

   Since other RFCs use "mandatory TLVs" and "mandatory sub-TLVs" to
   indicate TLVs and sub-TLVs that must be present in a message, we want
   to discontinue the use of "mandatory" to indicate TLVs and sub-TLVs
   that requires an error message in response if not understood.  The
   changes to the RFCs below are intended to align with this practice.

4.1.  Updates to RFC 8029

   Mandatory and optional is used to indicate whether are response ir
   needed or if at TLV or sub-TLV is not understoond page 14 and 15 in
   Section 3 of RFC 8029.

   The text in those two paragraphs are now updated to the following:

      TLV and sub-TLV Types less than 32768 (i.e., with the high-order
      bit equal to 0) are TLVs and sub-TLVs that MUST either be
      supported by an implementation or result in the Return Code of 2
      ("One or more of the TLVs was not understood") being sent in the
      echo response.

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries               August 2020


      An implementation that does not understand or support a received
      TLV or sub-TLV with Type greater than or equal to 32768 (i.e.,
      with the high-order bit equal to 1) SHOULD ignore and step over
      the TLV or sub-TLV, however an implementation MAY send an echo
      response with Return Code 2 ("One or more of the TLVs was not
      understood") as it would have done if the high order bit had been
      clear.

   In Section 3.8 of RFC 8029 "mandatory" is used in the same way.  The
   first two paragraphs of this section are now updated to read as
   follows:

      The following TLV is a TLV that MAY be included in an echo reply
      to inform the sender of an echo request that includes TLVs or sub-
      TLVs Types greater than or equal to 32768 (i.e., with the high-
      order bit equal to 1) are either not supported by the
      implementation or parsed and found to be in error.

      The Value field contains the TLVs, including sub-TLVs, that were
      not understood, encoded as sub-TLVs.

4.2.  Updates to RFC 8611

   The "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6" registry is now updated to align with
   changes defined in this document.

   The registration procedures for the "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6"
   registry will now be as follows:

              Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6 Registration Procedures

5.  Security Considerations

   This document updates IANA registries.  It also updates terminology
   used to define, and clarifies the terminology related to the code
   points in the registries.  The document does not change how the code-
   points in the registries are used.  This should not create any new
   threats.

   However, the updated terminology and the clarifications improve
   security because it makes it more likely that implementations will be
   consistent and harder to attack.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the LSP Ping name space as described in
   this document.
