1.  Introduction

   This document describes a URI resolution method for AREG [4] (Address
   Registry) type in the IRIS [2] namespace.  URI resolution is the
   process of determining which directory server to query for a given
   resource.

2.  Document Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].

3.  URI Resolution for AREG

3.1  Application Service Label

   The application service label associated with AREG registry type MUST
   be "AREG1".  This is the abbreviated form the URN for this registry
   type, urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:areg1.

3.2  Top-Down Resolution

   The top-down alternative resolution method MUST be identified as
   'top' in IRIS URI's.

   The client SHOULD start every query from the IRIS server
   iris.nro.net, the top of the hierarchy, and follow the referrals to
   find the authoritative server to actually query.  The client MAY
   start from any other IRIS server in the hierarchy, in which case,
   that IRIS server MAY choose to refer the client to the top of the
   hierarchy if it does not have the authoritative information, or if it
   has an up-to-date map of the current delegation status, it MAY choose
   to refer the client to the IRIS server it believes to be the
   authoritative server for the information sought for.

3.3  Discussion

   AREG URI resolution does not use DNS unlike DREG URI resolution [6].

   Using DNS makes sense in two cases:
   o  When the directory already has natural links to DNS,
   o  When the entities involved do not have the resources or intention
      to maintain the top of the hierarchy.

   In the case of AREG, the entities involved are RIRs (Regional
   Internet Registries) and NRO (Number Resource Organisation), which
   have enough resources and intention to maintain the top of the
   hierarchy.  In fact, RIRs have to keep the global distribution map of
   address allocation, which makes them, or the NRO, which is formed by
   the RIRs to formalize their co-operative efforts, the natural
   candidate to maintain the top of the hierarchy.

   Address registry does not have natural links to DNS either.  Using
   reverse DNS tree presents problems for IP address delegation (for
   example, delegations do not fall into byte boundaries, unlike reverse
   DNS), and DNS does not currently contain any information regarding
   autonomous system delegation.

   As a result, this memo suggests not using DNS for AREG URI
   resolution.

   DNS could perhaps be used to point to the top of the IRIS server
   hierarcy, but this is considered unnecessary indirection.
