 Recommendations for LSP Checksum Calculation and Related Processing in
 multi-vendor Networks using Intermediate System to Intermediate System
                 draft-li-isis-error-lsp-processing-03

Abstract

   Recommendations for Interoperable Networks using Intermediate System
   to Intermediate System (IS-IS) [RFC3719] highlights a number of
   differences between the IS-IS protocol as described in ISO 10589 and
   the protocol as it is deployed today.

   This document outlines a number of differences found in the China
   Mobile backbone network, which is constructed using routers from
   several manufacturers.  These differences include LSP checksum
   calculation, zero checksum LSP processing, zero remaining lifetime
   LSP processing, and corrupt LSP processing.  This document is
   intended to provide best current practices to facilitate
   interoperability and maintain network stability.

1.  Introduction

   IS-IS Protocol [ISO10589] is one of the Interior Gateway Protocols.
   It is widely deployed in the carrier backbone networks.

   [RFC3719] discusses a number of differences between the IS-IS
   protocol as described in ISO 10589 and the protocol as it is deployed
   today.

   In the China Mobile backbone network, constructed with hundreds of
   routers from several manufacturers, some differences in IS-IS
   implementations were identified.  These differences contribute to
   instability across the whole network.  The differences discussed in
   this document include Link State Protocol Data Unit (LSP) checksum
   calculation, zero checksum LSP processing, zero remaining lifetime
   LSP processing, and corrupt LSP processing.

   This document is intended to provide best current practices for LSP
   checksum calculation and related processing to facilitate
   interoperability and maintain network stability.  The following
   sections describe the problems and possible solutions in multi-vendor
   IS-IS environments.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

3.  Checksum Calculation

   ISO 10589, section 7.3.16.4, note 36, prescribes that examining the
   checksum of a zero Remaining Lifetime LSP is always successful.
   Thus, some implementations fill in the checksum field with zero in
   the zero Remaining Lifetime LSP.

   However, some implementations check the checksum regardless of the
   value of the Remain Lifetime.  To insure the interoperability and
   maintain network stability, it is RECOMMENDED to calculate the
   checksum of all LSPs correctly, including zero Remaining Lifetime
   LSP.  The calculation method is presented in Section 7.3.11, ISO
   10589.

4.  Zero Checksum LSP Processing

   Section 7 of [RFC3719] suggests an implementation SHOULD treat all
   LSPs with a zero checksum and a non-zero remaining lifetime, as if
   they had a checksum error.

   ISO 10589, section 7.3.16.4, note 36, states: A check of the checksum
   of a zero Remaining Lifetime LSP succeeds even though the data
   portion is not present.  Therefore, the LSP with a zero checksum and
   a zero remaining lifetime SHOULD be treated as an LSP with the
   correct checksum.

   Considering the above two conditions together, the implementation
   SHOULD check the remaining lifetime first, then check the checksum.
   In practice, some implementations perform the check in reverse.  The
   suggested processing procedure is shown in Figure 1.

             +--------------+
         +---| LSP Received |
         |   +--------------+
         |
         |   +----------------+
         +-->| zero remaining | Yes  +------------------------+
         +---| lifetime?      |----->|Zero remaining lifetime |
         |   +----------------+      |LSP processing specified|
         |No                         |      in Section 4      |
         |                           +------------------------+
         |   +--------------+
         +-->|Zero checksum?| Yes  +---------------------+
         +---|              |----->|                     |
         |   +--------------+      |   Corrupt LSP       |
         |                         |processing specified |
         |                  +----->|   in Section 5      |
         |No                |      +---------------------+
         |                  |
         |   +----------+   |
         +-->| Checksum |Yes|
         +---|  error?  |---+
         |   +----------+
         |No
         |   +----------------------+
         +-->|Correct LSP processing|
             +----------------------+

   LSPs with a zero checksum and a non-zero remaining lifetime according
   to the processing mechanism mentioned in Section 5 of this document.
   That is treating this kind of LSPs as corrupt LSPs.

   As for the LSPs with a zero checksum and a zero remaining lifetime,
   the processing mechanism SHOULD NOT be affected by the state of the
   switch.  That is treating this kind of LSPs as correct zero remaining
   lifetime LSPs.  The suggested process mechanism is specified in
   Section 4 of this document.

5.  Zero Remaining Lifetime LSP Processing

   ISO 10589, section 7.3.16.4, note 36, states: A check of the checksum
   of a zero Remaining Lifetime LSP succeeds even though the data
   portion is not present.  Therefore, a zero Remaining Lifetime LSP
   SHOULD be treated as a correct LSP, no matter whether its checksum is
   correct or not.

   Some implementations, however, still check the checksum of a zero
   Remaining Lifetime LSP.

   The processing mechanism SHOULD NOT be affected by the on-off switch
   and the details can be seen in section 7.3.16.4, ISO 10589.

6.  Corrupt LSP Processing

   Section 7.3.14.2 e) of [ISO10589] states: An IS receiving a LSP with
   an incorrect LSP Checksum or with an invalid PDU syntax shall 1)
   generate a corruptedLSPReceived circuit event, 2) discard the PDU.

   In order to control the processing mechanism of Checksum error LSP,
   some equipment manufacturers provide an on-off configuration switch.
   However, the default state of the switch is different, thus the
   processing mechanism of checksum error LSP is not the same.

   From the carrier's perspective, such on-off configuration switch is
   welcome, because the carrier can determine the processing mechanism
   through the switch.  But the behavior of the switch SHOULD be the
   same, as follows.

   When the on-off switch is on, the processing mechanism for the
   checksum error LSP SHOULD be accordant with what is stated in Section
   7.3.14.2 e) of [ISO10589].  When the on-off switch is off, the
   equipment SHOULD treat the received checksum error LSP in the same
   way as the LSP whose remaining lifetime equals 0, i.e. treating the
   checksum error LSP as zero remaining lifetime LSP.  The processing
   mechanism is specified in Section 4 of this document.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the default state of the on-off switch be on.
   In this way, the default processing mechanism is in accordance with
   Section 7.3.14.2 e) of [ISO10589].
