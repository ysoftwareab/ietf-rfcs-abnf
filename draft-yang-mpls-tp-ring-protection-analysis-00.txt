Internet-Draft      MPLS-TP Ring Protection Analysis        October 2008


1.  Introduction

   Network survivability reflects the ability of a network to continue
   to function during failures and recovery.  The three potential
   solutions to the MPLS-TP ring protection were addressed in the report
   of the IETF - ITU-T Joint Working Team (JWT).  Each solution has
   different attributes and advantages.  This document provides an
   analysis for MPLS-TP-based ring protection.

   These three potential solutions are:

   -  Facility bypass: A single facility bypass LSP protects all LSPs
      over a specific link by wrapping traffic.

   -  Detours: A detour LSP can be used for optimal traffic delivery to
      the egress point (without wrapping).

   -  ITU-T G.8132: It defines a ring protection that includes
      additional capabilities to the MPLS protection schemes, by
      supporting coordinated protection in case of multiple failures
      (using single protection mechanism for all cases).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.

   The following terminologies were defined in [RFC4090].

   LSR: Label-Switch Router.

   LSP: An MPLS Label-Switched Path.  In this document, an LSP will
   always be explicitly routed.

   PLR: Point of Local Repair.  The head-end LSR of a backup tunnel or a
   detour LSP.

   One-to-One Backup: A local repair method in which a backup LSP is
   separately created for each protected LSP at a PLR.

   Protected LSP: An LSP is said to be protected at a given hop if it
   has one or multiple associated backup tunnels originating at that
   hop.

   Detour LSP: The LSP that is used to re-route traffic around a failure
   in one-to-one backup.

   Bypass Tunnel: An LSP that is used to protect a set of LSPs passing
   over a common facility.

   Backup Path: The LSP that is responsible for backing up one protected
   LSP.  A backup path refers to either a detour LSP or a backup tunnel.

   MP: Merge Point.  The LSR where one or more backup tunnels rejoin the
   path of the protected LSP downstream of the potential failure.  The
   same LSR may be both an MP and a PLR simultaneously.

   The following terminologies were defined in [ITU-T G.8132 draft].

   APS channel: Automatic Protection Switch (APS) Channel is used to
   carry information between the two ends of a linear protection group
   to coordinate the head-end bridge with the tail-end selector for 1:n
   protection, and to coordinate the selectors in both directions in the
   case of bidirectional protection.

   Bridge: The function that connects the normal and extra traffic
   signals to the working and protection transport entities.

   OAM: Operation, Administration and Maintenance.

   SF: Signal Fail.


3.  Facility bypass

   The facility bypass is one of the backup methods defined in
   [RFC4090].  It created a single LSP(bypass LSP tunnel) that serves to
   back up a set of LSPs.  The bypass tunnel must intersect the path of
   the original LSP(s) somewhere downstream of the PLR.

   The PLR built a bypass tunnel that protects against the failure of a
   link or a node.  When a failure occurs along a protected LSP, the PLR
   redirects traffic into the appropriate bypass tunnel.  If protected
   link fails, the PLR will switch traffic received from upstream LSR on
   the protected LSP onto the bypass tunnel.  The label will be switched
   for one which was assigned by MP to indicate the protected LSP, and
   the bypass tunnel's label will then be pushed onto the label-stack of
   the redirected packets.  So there will be two levels of labels used
   in the bypass tunnel.  When MP receives the redirected packets, it
   pops the label that it assigned for bypass tunnel and uses the label
   that it assigned for protected LSP to forward the packet.

   The Facility bypass technique provides that using the same bypass
   tunnel protects many LSPs which traverse the same links or nodes.

   Link protection: The PLR and MP are connected through a direct link
   and the primary LSP traverses this link.When the link fails, traffic
   is switched to the backup LSP.

   Node protection: The PLR and MP are connected through a device and
   the primary LSP traverses this device.  When the device fails,
   traffic is switched to the backup LSP.


4.  Detours

   The detours one to one backup is the other method defined in
   [RFC4090].  In the one-to-one backup method, a label-switched path is
   established that intersects the original LSP somewhere downstream of
   the point of link or node failure.  A PLR computes a separate backup
   LSP, called a detour LSP, for each LSP that the PLR protects.

   When a failure occurs along the protected LSP, the PLR redirects
   traffic onto the local detour, using the label received when PLR
   created the detour.  When MP receives traffic with the label provided
   for PLR's detour, it will switch that traffic onto the original LSP,
   using the label received from the node of MP's next hop.  In the
   detour mode, the depth of label stack will not increase.

   It provides an optimized detour methord in [MPLS-TP JWT REPORT] to
   protect an LSP that traverses N nodes only using one detour tunnel
   without wrapping.


5.  ITU-T G.8132

   The T-MPLS Shared Protection Ring (TM-SPRing) protection switching
   mechanisms are specified in [ITU-T G.8132 draft].  It provides the
   protection connection as a ring topology to protect the working LSP.
   Each section (span) in the ring is monitored by sending CV OAM with
   periodicity of 3.3ms and Span failures are detected as absence of 3
   consecutive CV frames.  Each node has an APS controller that sends
   and receives APS messages.  These messages inform the states of the
   ring.

   When failure occurs, the nodes adjacent to the failure enter the
   switching state and sends APS SF message to neighbor nodes.  The
   traffic is switching to the protection connection.  When the other
   nodes in the ring receive the SF message, they enter pass-through
   state (i.e. allow forwarding on the protection LSP) and forward the
   APS messages without modification.

   The APS protocol and associated OAM functions shall accommodate the

   capability to upgrade the ring (node insertion /removal), limiting
   the possible impact on existing traffic on the ring.  The same
   mechanism with a single protection connection restores all traffic
   possible: p2p, p2mp connections, fiber or node failure, single or
   multiple failures.

   There are two solutions, the wrapping and the steering techniques in
   TM-SPRing protection.

   -  The Wrapping technique: It implies that the node that detects a
      failure sends a request through the APS protocol to the node
      adjacent to the failure.  When the node detects a failure or
      receives a bridge request through APS protocol addressed to this
      node, normal traffic transmitted towards the failed span is
      switched to the opposite direction (away from the failure).  This
      traffic travels the long way around the ring to the other
      switching node where it is switched back onto the working
      direction.  The switching nodes restore normal traffic flow when
      the failure or APS protocol request is cleared.

   -  The Steering technique: It implies that the node that detects a
      failure sends a request through the APS protocol to the node
      adjacent to the failure and all nodes in the ring process this APS
      information.  In case of p2p connections, for each affected
      connection the source node (that adds traffic to the ring) and the
      sink node (that drops the traffic from the ring) perform switching
      from working to the protection direction, and restore normal
      traffic flow when the failure or APS protocol request is cleared.


6.  Solutions analysis

   As described in the sections above, the each solution has different
   attributes and advantages.  This section will provide an analysis for
   MPLS-TP based ring protection.

6.1.  Capability analysis

   The table1 shows the capability analysis of the different solutions.

   -  Amounts of the backup LSP: The both Detour and G.8132 solutions
      require the same amounts of the backup LSPs to the original LSPs.
      However, the Bypass method can use the one backup LSP to protect
      many original LSPs.

   -  Bandwith utilization ratio: When protection occurs, the G.8132
      steering method can bridge and switch directly at the nodes with
      traffic ingress and egress.  In the other sloutions including the
      bypass, detour and G.8132 wrapping, the traffic in case of
      protection travels the long way around the ring to the other
      switching node where it is switched back onto the working
      direction.  So the G.8132 steering is the highest one of the
      bandwidth utilization ratio.

   -  The complexity of configuration and APS: G.8132 needs the APS
      protocol to implement the switch and the bridge.

   -  Packets disorder: There is a MP in the bypass and detour solution.
      The merge operation may cause packets disorder.

6.2.  Requirements analysis

   The table2 shows the requirements analysis of the different
   solutions.  These requirements are based on the [MPLS-TP JWT REPORT]
   and the [MPLS-TP Survivability Framework].

   -  Node failure: The all solutions support the node failure.  But the
      bypass method must establish as many as N bypass tunnels to
      protect the N nodes in the protected LSP.  And the other LSP
      should be established in order to protect the link between the
      protected node and its upstream node.

   -  Mutiple failures: One bypass tunnel can only protect single
      failure of the protected LSP, a node or a link failure.  It can't
      provide the protection of multiple failures.

   -  External commands: External commands in the bypass and the detour
      solution are not sufficient,should be extended to meet the
      requirements.

   -  Bidirectional LSPs: The issue to force both ends pick same merge
      point for each direction in detour methord is to be studied.

   -  Application to P2MP LSPs: P2MP LSP protection based on FRR is
      covered in [RFC 4875], but if it could be used or not in ring
      topology are to be studied.

   -  Operator's Qos objectives on protection path: In the bypass
      solution, the many protected LSPs share one bypass tunnel.  When
      protection occurs, all the protected the traffic redirect onto the
      bypass tunnel.  EIR services from different protected LSPs can't
      be distinguished.  The Qos of these EIR services can't be
      guaranteed.
