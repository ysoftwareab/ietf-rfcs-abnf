       An X.509 Extension for Manufacturer Usage Description URI
                 draft-lear-ietf-pkix-mud-extension-00

Abstract

   Manufacturer User Descriptions are used by device manufacturers to
   provide indications to the network as to the intended use of a
   particular device and with what end points it might communicate.  A
   URI points to those descriptions.  This memo specifies an X.509
   certificate extension to specify that URI in a device certificate to
   be used with IEEE 802.1AR.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.lear-mud-framework] introduces the concept of manufacturer usage
   description.  In other documents, DHCP is used to identify a URI that
   network systems can use to retrieve YANG-based XML that advises the
   network on appropriate usage of a device.

   Use of DHCP as a means of transmission may not be appropriate for all
   use cases, particularly for devices intended for use in critical
   environments.  The IEEE has developed [IEEE8021AR] that provides a
   certificate-based approach to communicate device characteristics,
   which itself relies on [RFC5280].

   This document specifies an X.509 extension so that such MUD URI may
   be communicated via 802.1AR.  The MUD URI extension is non-critical,
   as required by IEEE 802.1AR.

2.  The Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) URI Extension

   [RFC7299] provides a procedure and means to specify extensions to
   X.509 certificates.  The object identifier (OID) for extensions is as
   follows:

   - PKIX certificate extensions id-pe OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 1
   }

   The choice of id-pe is based on guidance found in Section 4.2.2 of
   [RFC5280]:

      These extensions may be used to direct applications to on-line
      information about the issuer or the subject.

   The MUD URI is precisely that: online information about the
   particular subject.

   The new extension is identified as follows:

   - The MUD URI extension id-pe-mud-uri OBJECT IDENTIFER ::= { id-pe
   TBD }

   The extension returns a single value:

   mud-uri ::= uniformResourceIdentifier - for use with mud
   architecture.

   The semantics of the URI are defined [I-D.lear-ietf-netmod-mud].

3.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies a certificate extension to communicate a
   Manufacturer Usage Description URI.  The semantics of the URI are
   defined in draft-lear-ietf-netmod-mud.  At this time, no security
   concerns are visible to the author for inclusion of such an
   extension.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to assign a value for id-pe-mud-uri in the "SMI
   Security for PKIX Certificate Extension" Registry.

5.  Acknowledgments

   The author wishes to thank Max Pritikin for his review and
   suggestions.
