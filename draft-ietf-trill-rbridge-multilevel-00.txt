Abstract

   Extending TRILL to multiple levels has challenges that are not
   addressed by the already-existing capability of IS-IS to have
   multiple levels.  One issue is with the handling of multi-destination
   packet distribution trees. Another issue is with TRILL switch
   nicknames.  There have been two proposed approaches.  One approach,
   which we refer to as the "unique nickname" approach, gives unique
   nicknames to all the TRILL switches in the multilevel campus, either
   by having the level-1/level-2 border TRILL switches advertise which
   nicknames are not available for assignment in the area, or by
   partitioning the 16-bit nickname into an "area" field and a "nickname
   inside the area" field.  The other approach, which we refer to as the
   "aggregated nickname" approach, involves hiding the nicknames within
   areas, allowing nicknames to be reused in different areas, by having
   the border TRILL switches rewrite the nickname fields when entering
   or leaving an area. Each of those approaches has advantages and
   disadvantages. This informational document suggests allowing a choice
   of approach in each area. This allows the simplicity of the unique
   nickname approach in installations in which there is no danger of
   running out of nicknames and allows the complexity of hiding the
   nicknames in an area to be phased into larger installations on a per-
   area basis.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                          Multilevel TRILL


1. Introduction

   The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lot of Links or
   Tunneled Routing in the Link Layer) protocol [RFC6325] [RFC7177]
   provides optimal pair-wise data routing without configuration, safe
   forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and support for
   multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic in networks with
   arbitrary topology and link technology, including multi-access links.
   TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS (Intermediate System to
   Intermediate System [IS-IS] [RFC7176]) link state routing in
   conjunction with a header that includes a hop count. The design
   supports data labels (VLANs and Fine Grained Labels [RFC7172]) and
   optimization of the distribution of multi-destination data based on
   VLANs and multicast groups. Devices that implement TRILL are called
   TRILL Switches or RBridges.

   Familiarity with [IS-IS], [RFC6325], and [rfc7180bis] is assumed in
   this document.



1.1 TRILL Scalability Issues

   There are multiple issues that might limit the scalability of a
   TRILL-based network:

   1. the routing computation load,
   2. the volatility of the link state database (LSDB) creating too much
      control traffic,
   3. the volatility of the LSDB causing the TRILL network to be in an
      unconverged state too much of the time,
   4. the size of the LSDB,
   5. the limit of the number of TRILL switches, due to the 16-bit
      nickname space,
   6. the traffic due to upper layer protocols use of broadcast and
      multicast, and
   7. the size of the end node learning table (the table that remembers
      (egress TRILL switch, label/MAC) pairs).

   Extending TRILL IS-IS to be multilevel (hierarchical) helps with all
   but the last of these issues.

   IS-IS was designed to be multilevel [IS-IS].  A network can be
   partitioned into "areas".  Routing within an area is known as "Level
   1 routing".  Routing between areas is known as "Level 2 routing".
   The Level 2 IS-IS network consists of Level 2 routers and links
   between the Level 2 routers.  Level 2 routers may participate in one
   or more Level 1 areas, in addition to their role as Level 2 routers.

   Each area is connected to Level 2 through one or more "border


R. Perlman, et al                                               [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                          Multilevel TRILL


   routers", which participate both as a router inside the area, and as
   a router inside the Level 2 "area".  Care must be taken that it is
   clear, when transitioning multi-destination packets between Level 2
   and a Level 1 area in either direction, that exactly one border TRILL
   switch will transition a particular data packet between the levels or
   else duplication or loss of traffic can occur.



1.2 Improvements Due to Multilevel

   Partitioning the network into areas solves the first four scalability
   issues described above, namely,

   1. the routing computation load,

   2. the volatility of the LSDB creating too much control traffic,

   3. the volatility of the LSDB causing the TRILL network to be in an
      unconverged state too much of the time,

   4. the size of the LSDB.

   Problem #6 in Section 1.1, namely, the traffic due to upper layer
   protocols use of broadcast and multicast, can be addressed by
   introducing a locally-scoped multi-destination delivery, limited to
   an area or a single link. See further discussion in Section 4.2.

   Problem #5 in Section 1.1, namely, the limit of the number of TRILL
   switches, due to the 16-bit nickname space, will only be addressed
   with the aggregated nickname approach. Since the aggregated nickname
   approach requires some complexity in the border TRILL switches (for
   rewriting the nicknames in the TRILL header), the design in this
   document allows a campus with a mixture of unique-nickname areas, and
   aggregated-nickname areas.  Nicknames must be unique across all Level
   2 and unique-nickname area TRILL switches, whereas nicknames inside
   an aggregated-nickname area are visible only inside the area.
   Nicknames inside an aggregated-nickname area must not conflict with
   nicknames visible in Level 2 (which includes all nicknames inside
   unique nickname areas), but the nicknames inside an aggregated-
   nickname area may be the same as nicknames used within other
   aggregated-nickname areas.

   TRILL switches within an area need not be aware of whether they are
   in an aggregated nickname area or a unique nickname area.  The border
   TRILL switches in area A1 will claim, in their LSP inside area A1,
   which nicknames (or nickname ranges) are not available for choosing
   as nicknames by area A1 TRILL switches.

1.3 Unique and Aggregated Nicknames

   We describe two alternatives for hierarchical or multilevel TRILL.
   One we call the "unique nickname" alternative.  The other we call the
   "aggregated nickname" alternative. In the aggregated nickname
   alternative, border TRILL switches replace either the ingress or
   egress nickname field in the TRILL header of unicast packets with an
   aggregated nickname representing an entire area.

   The unique nickname alternative has the advantage that border TRILL
   switches are simpler and do not need to do TRILL Header nickname
   modification.  It also simplifies testing and maintenance operations
   that originate in one area and terminate in a different area.

   The aggregated nickname alternative has the following advantages:

      o  it solves problem #5 above, the 16-bit nickname limit, in a
         simple way,
      o  it lessens the amount of inter-area routing information that
         must be passed in IS-IS, and
      o  it logically reduces the RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) Check
         information (since only the area nickname needs to appear,
         rather than all the ingress TRILL switches in that area).

   In both cases, it is possible and advantageous to compute multi-
   destination data packet distribution trees such that the portion
   computed within a given area is rooted within that area.



1.3 More on Areas

   Each area is configured with an "area address", which is advertised
   in IS-IS messages, so as to avoid accidentally interconnecting areas.
   Although the area address had other purposes in CLNP (Connectionless
   Network Layer Protocol, IS-IS was originally designed for
   CLNP/DECnet), for TRILL the only purpose of the area address would be
   to avoid accidentally interconnecting areas.

   Currently, the TRILL specification says that the area address must be
   zero. If we change the specification so that the area address value
   of zero is just a default, then most of IS-IS multilevel machinery
   works as originally designed.  However, there are TRILL-specific
   issues, which we address below in this document.

1.4 Terminology and Acronyms

   This document generally uses the acronyms defined in [RFC6325] plus
   the additional acronym DBRB. However, for ease of reference, most
   acronyms used are listed here:

      CLNP - ConnectionLess Network Protocol

      DECnet - a proprietary routing protocol that was used by Digital
      Equipment Corporation. "DECnet Phase 5" was the origin of IS-IS.

      Data Label - VLAN or Fine Grained Label [RFC7172]

      DBRB - Designated Border RBridge

      ESADI - End Station Address Distribution Information

      IS-IS - Intermediate System to Intermediate System [IS-IS]

      LSDB - Link State Data Base

      LSP - Link State PDU

      PDU - Protocol Data Unit

      RBridge - Routing Bridge, an alterntive name for a TRILL switch

      RPF - Reverse Path Forwarding

      TLV - Type Length Value

      TRILL - Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links or Tunneled
      Routing in the Link Layer [RFC6325]

      TRILL switch - a device that implements the TRILL protcol
      [RFC6325], sometimes called an RBridge

      VLAN - Virtual Local Area Network

2. Multilevel TRILL Issues

   The TRILL-specific issues introduced by multilevel include the
   following:

   a. Configuration of non-zero area addresses, encoding them in IS-IS
      PDUs, and possibly interworking with old TRILL switches that do
      not understand nonzero area addresses.

         See Section 2.1.

   b. Nickname management.

         See Sections 2.5 and 2.2.

   c. Advertisement of pruning information (Data Label reachability, IP
      multicast addresses) across areas.

         Distribution tree pruning information is only an optimization,
         as long as multi-destination packets are not prematurely
         pruned.  For instance, border TRILL switches could advertise
         they can reach all possible Data Labels, and have an IP
         multicast router attached.  This would cause all multi-
         destination traffic to be transmitted to border TRILL switches,
         and possibly pruned there, when the traffic could have been
         pruned earlier based on Data Label or multicast group if border
         TRILL switches advertised more detailed Data Label and/or
         multicast listener and multicast router attachment information.

   d. Computation of distribution trees across areas for multi-
      destination data.

         See Section 2.3.

   e. Computation of RPF information for those distribution trees.

         See Section 2.4.

   f. Computation of pruning information across areas.

         See Sections 2.3 and 2.6.

   g. Compatibility, as much as practical, with existing, unmodified
      TRILL switches.

         The most important form of compatibility is with existing TRILL
         fast path hardware. Changes that require upgrade to the slow
         path firmware/software are more tolerable. Compatibility for
         the relatively small number of border TRILL switches is less
         important than compatibility for non-border TRILL switches.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                          Multilevel TRILL


         See Section 5.



2.1 Non-zero Area Addresses

   The current TRILL base protocol specification [RFC6325] [RFC7177]
   [rfc7180bis] says that the area address in IS-IS must be zero.  The
   purpose of the area address is to ensure that different areas are not
   accidentally merged.  Furthermore, zero is an invalid area address
   for layer 3 IS-IS, so it was chosen as an additional safety mechanism
   to ensure that layer 3 IS-IS would not be confused with TRILL IS-IS.
   However, TRILL uses other techniques to avoid such confusion, such as
   different multicast addresses and Ethertypes on Ethernet [RFC6325],
   different PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) codepoints on PPP [RFC6361],
   and the like. Thus, using an area address in TRILL that might be used
   in layer 3 IS-IS is not a problem.

   Since current TRILL switches will reject any IS-IS messages with
   nonzero area addresses, the choices are as follows:

   a.1 upgrade all TRILL switches that are to interoperate in a
       potentially multilevel environment to understand non-zero area
       addresses,
   a.2 neighbors of old TRILL switches must remove the area address from
       IS-IS messages when talking to an old TRILL switch (which might
       break IS-IS security and/or cause inadvertent merging of areas),
   a.3 ignore the problem of accidentally merging areas entirely, or
   a.4 keep the fixed "area address" field as 0 in TRILL, and add a new,
       optional TLV for "area name" to Hellos that, if present, could be
       compared, by new TRILL switches, to prevent accidental area
       merging.

   In principal, different solutions could be used in different areas
   but it would be much simpler to adopt one of these choices uniformly.



2.2 Aggregated versus Unique Nicknames

   In the unique nickname alternative, all nicknames across the campus
   must be unique.  In the aggregated nickname alternative, TRILL switch
   nicknames within an aggregated area are only of local significance,
   and the only nickname externally (outside that area) visible is the
   "area nickname" (or nicknames), which aggregates all the internal
   nicknames.

   The unique nickname approach simplifies border TRILL switches.

   The aggregated nickname approach eliminates the potential problem of


R. Perlman, et al                                               [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                          Multilevel TRILL


   nickname exhaustion, minimizes the amount of nickname information
   that would need to be forwarded between areas, minimizes the size of
   the forwarding table, and simplifies RPF calculation and RPF
   information.



2.2.1 More Details on Unique Nicknames

   With unique cross-area nicknames, it would be intractable to have a
   flat nickname space with TRILL switches in different areas contending
   for the same nicknames.  Instead, each area would need to be
   configured with a block of nicknames.  Either some TRILL switches
   would need to announce that all the nicknames other than that block
   are taken (to prevent the TRILL switches inside the area from
   choosing nicknames outside the area's nickname block), or a new TLV
   would be needed to announce the allowable nicknames, and all TRILL
   switches in the area would need to understand that new TLV. An
   example of the second approach is given in [NickFlags].

   Currently the encoding of nickname information in TLVs is by listing
   of individual nicknames; this would make it painful for a border
   TRILL switch to announce into an area that it is holding all other
   nicknames to limit the nicknames available within that area.  The
   information could be encoded as ranges of nicknames to make this
   somewhat manageable [NickFlags]; however, a new TLV for announcing
   nickname ranges would not be intelligible to old TRILL switches.

   There is also an issue with the unique nicknames approach in building
   distribution trees, as follows:

      With unique nicknames in the TRILL campus and TRILL header
      nicknames not rewritten by the border TRILL switches, there would
      have to be globally known nicknames for the trees.  Suppose there
      are k trees.  For all of the trees with nicknames located outside
      an area, the local trees would be rooted at a border TRILL switch
      or switches.  Therefore, there would be either no splitting of
      multi-destination traffic with the area or restricted splitting of
      multi-destination traffic between trees rooted at a highly
      restricted set of TRILL switches.

      As an alternative, just the "egress nickname" field of multi-
      destination TRILL Data packets could be mapped at the border,
      leaving known unicast packets un-mapped. However, this surrenders
      much of the unique nickname advantage of simpler border TRILL
      switches.

   Scaling to a very large campus with unique nicknames might exhaust
   the 16-bit TRILL nicknames space. One method might be to expand
   nicknames to 24 bits; however, that technique would require TRILL

INTERNET-DRAFT                                          Multilevel TRILL


   message format changes and that all TRILL switches in the campus
   understand larger nicknames.

   For an example of a more specific multilevel proposal using unique
   nicknames, see [DraftUnique].



2.2.2 More Details on Aggregated Nicknames

   The aggregated nickname approach enables passing far less nickname
   information. It works as follows, assuming both the source and
   destination areas are using aggregated nicknames:

      There are two ways areas could be identified.

      One method would be to assign each area a 16-bit nickname. This
      would not be the nickname of any actual TRILL switch. Instead, it
      would be the nickname of the area itself.  Border TRILL switches
      would know the area nickname for their own area(s).

      Alternatively, areas could be identified by the set of nicknames
      that identify the border routers for that area. (See [SingleName]
      for a multilevel proposal using such a set of nicknames.)

   The TRILL Header nickname fields in TRILL Data packets being
   transported through a multilevel TRILL campus with aggregated
   nicknames are as follows:

     -  When both the ingress and egress TRILL switches are in the same
        area, there need be no change from the existing base TRILL
        protocol standard in the TRILL Header nickname fields.

     -  When being transported in Level 2, the ingress nickname is the
        nickname of the ingress TRILL switch's area while the egress
        nickname is either the nickname of the egress TRILL switch's
        area or a tree nickname.

     -  When being transported from Level 1 to Level 2, the ingress
        nickname is the nickname of the ingress TRILL switch itself
        while the egress nickname is either a nickname for the area of
        the egress TRILL switch or a tree nickname.

     -  When being transported from Level 2 to Level 1, the ingress
        nickname is a nickname for the ingress TRILL switch's area while
        the egress nickname is either the nickname of the egress TRILL
        switch itself or a tree nickname.

   There are two variations of the aggregated nickname approach. The
   first is the Border Learning approach, which is described in Section


R. Perlman, et al                                              [Page 11]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                          Multilevel TRILL


   2.2.2.1. The second is the Swap Nickname Field approach, which is
   described in Section 2.2.2.2. Section 2.2.2.3 compares the advantages
   and disadvantages of these two variations of the aggregated nickname
   approach.



2.2.2.1 Border Learning Aggregated Nicknames

   This section provides an illustrative example and description of the
   border learning variation of aggregated nicknames where a single
   nickname is used to identify an area.

   In the following picture, RB2 and RB3 are area border TRILL switches
   (RBridges).  A source S is attached to RB1.  The two areas have
   nicknames 15961 and 15918, respectively.  RB1 has a nickname, say 27,
   and RB4 has a nickname, say 44 (and in fact, they could even have the
   same nickname, since the TRILL switch nickname will not be visible
   outside these aggregated areas).

            Area 15961              level 2             Area 15918
    +-------------------+     +-----------------+     +--------------+
    |                   |     |                 |     |              |
    |  S--RB1---Rx--Rz----RB2---Rb---Rc--Rd---Re--RB3---Rk--RB4---D  |
    |     27            |     |                 |     |     44       |
    |                   |     |                 |     |              |
    +-------------------+     +-----------------+     +--------------+

   Let's say that S transmits a frame to destination D, which is
   connected to RB4, and let's say that D's location has already been
   learned by the relevant TRILL switches.  These relevant switches have
   learned the following:

   1) RB1 has learned that D is connected to nickname 15918
   2) RB3 has learned that D is attached to nickname 44.

   The following sequence of events will occur:

   -  S transmits an Ethernet frame with source MAC = S and destination
      MAC = D.

   -  RB1 encapsulates with a TRILL header with ingress RBridge = 27,
      and egress = 15918 producing a TRILL Data packet.

   -  RB2 has announced in the Level 1 IS-IS instance in area 15961,
      that it is attached to all the area nicknames, including 15918.
      Therefore, IS-IS routes the packet to RB2. Alternatively, if a
      distinguished range of nicknames is used for Level 2, Level 1
      TRILL switches seeing such an egress nickname will know to route
      to the nearest border router, which can be indicated by the IS-IS

      attached bit.

   -  RB2, when transitioning the packet from Level 1 to Level 2,
      replaces the ingress TRILL switch nickname with the area nickname,
      so replaces 27 with 15961. Within Level 2, the ingress RBridge
      field in the TRILL header will therefore be 15961, and the egress
      RBridge field will be 15918. Also RB2 learns that S is attached to
      nickname 27 in area 15961 to accommodate return traffic.

   -  The packet is forwarded through Level 2, to RB3, which has
      advertised, in Level 2, reachability to the nickname 15918.

   -  RB3, when forwarding into area 15918, replaces the egress nickname
      in the TRILL header with RB4's nickname (44).  So, within the
      destination area, the ingress nickname will be 15961 and the
      egress nickname will be 44.

   -  RB4, when decapsulating, learns that S is attached to nickname
      15961, which is the area nickname of the ingress.

   Now suppose that D's location has not been learned by RB1 and/or RB3.
   What will happen, as it would in TRILL today, is that RB1 will
   forward the packet as multi-destination, choosing a tree.  As the
   multi-destination packet transitions into Level 2, RB2 replaces the
   ingress nickname with the area nickname. If RB1 does not know the
   location of D, the packet must be flooded, subject to possible
   pruning, in Level 2 and, subject to possible pruning, from Level 2
   into every Level 1 area that it reaches on the Level 2 distribution
   tree.

   Now suppose that RB1 has learned the location of D (attached to
   nickname 15918), but RB3 does not know where D is.  In that case, RB3
   must turn the packet into a multi-destination packet within area
   15918.  In this case, care must be taken so that, in case RB3 is not
   the Designated transitioner between Level 2 and its area for that
   multi-destination packet, but was on the unicast path, that another
   border TRILL switch in that area not forward the now multi-
   destination packet back into Level 2.  Therefore, it would be
   desirable to have a marking, somehow, that indicates the scope of
   this packet's distribution to be "only this area" (see also Section
   4).

   In cases where there are multiple transitioners for unicast packets,
   the border learning mode of operation requires that the address
   learning between them be shared by some protocol such as running
   ESADI [RFC7357] for all Data Labels of interest to avoid excessive
   unknown unicast flooding.

   The potential issue described at the end of Section 2.2.1 with trees
   in the unique nickname alternative is eliminated with aggregated

   nicknames.  With aggregated nicknames, each border TRILL switch that
   will transition multi-destination packets can have a mapping between
   Level 2 tree nicknames and Level 1 tree nicknames.  There need not
   even be agreement about the total number of trees; just that the
   border TRILL switch have some mapping, and replace the egress TRILL
   switch nickname (the tree name) when transitioning levels.



2.2.2.2 Swap Nickname Field Aggregated Nicknames

   As a variant, two additional fields could exist in TRILL Data packets
   we call the "ingress swap nickname field" and the "egress swap
   nickname field". The changes in the example above would be as
   follows:

   -  RB1 will have learned the area nickname of D and the TRILL switch
      nickname of RB4 to which D is attached. In encapsulating a frame
      to D, it puts an area nickname of D (15918) in the egress nickname
      field of the TRILL Header and puts a nickname of RB3 (44) in a
      egress swap nickname field.

   -  RB2 moves the ingress nickname to the ingress swap nickname field
      and inserts 15961, an area nickname for S, into the ingress
      nickname field.

   -  RB3 swaps the egress nickname and the egress swap nickname fields,
      which sets the egress nickname to 44.

   -  RB4 learns the correspondence between the source MAC/VLAN of S and
      the { ingress nickname, ingress swap nickname field } pair as it
      decapsulates and egresses the frame.

   See [DraftAggregated] for a multilevel proposal using aggregated swap
   nicknames with a single nickname representing an area.



2.2.2.3 Comparison

   The Border Learning variant described in Section 2.2.2.1 above
   minimizes the change in non-border TRILL switches but imposes the
   burden on border TRILL switches of learning and doing lookups in all
   the end station MAC addresses within their area(s) that are used for
   communication outside the area. This burden could be reduced by
   decreasing the area size and increasing the number of areas.

   The Swap Nickname Field variant described in Section 2.2.2.2
   eliminates the extra address learning burden on border TRILL switches
   but requires more extensive changes to non-border TRILL switches. In


R. Perlman, et al                                              [Page 14]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                          Multilevel TRILL


   particular they must learn to associate both a TRILL switch nickname
   and an area nickname with end station MAC/label pairs (except for
   addresses that are local to their area).

   The Swap Nickname Field alternative is more scalable but less
   backward compatible for non-border TRILL switches. It would be
   possible for border and other level 2 TRILL switches to support both
   Border Learning, for support of legacy Level 1 TRILL switches, and
   Swap Nickname, to support Level 1 TRILL switches that understood the
   Swap Nickname method.



2.3 Building Multi-Area Trees

   It is easy to build a multi-area tree by building a tree in each area
   separately, (including the Level 2 "area"), and then having only a
   single border TRILL switch, say RBx, in each area, attach to the
   Level 2 area.  RBx would forward all multi-destination packets
   between that area and Level 2.

   People might find this unacceptable, however, because of the desire
   to path split (not always sending all multi-destination traffic
   through the same border TRILL switch).

   This is the same issue as with multiple ingress TRILL switches
   injecting traffic from a pseudonode, and can be solved with the
   mechanism that was adopted for that purpose: the affinity TLV
   [DraftCMT].  For each tree in the area, at most one border RB
   announces itself in an affinity TLV with that tree name.



2.4 The RPF Check for Trees

   For multi-destination data originating locally in RBx's area,
   computation of the RPF check is done as today.  For multi-destination
   packets originating outside RBx's area, computation of the RPF check
   must be done based on which one of the border TRILL switches (say
   RB1, RB2, or RB3) injected the packet into the area.

   A TRILL switch, say RB4, located inside an area, must be able to know
   which of RB1, RB2, or RB3 transitioned the packet into the area from
   Level 2.  (or into Level 2 from an area).

   This could be done based on having the DBRB announce the transitioner
   assignments to all the TRILL switches in the area, or the Affinity
   TLV mechanism given in [DraftCMT], or the New Tree Encoding mechanism
   discussed in Section 4.1.1.

2.5 Area Nickname Acquisition

   In the aggregated nickname alternative, each area must acquire a
   unique area nickname.  It is probably simpler to allocate a block of
   nicknames (say, the top 4000) to be area addresses, and not used by
   any TRILL switches.

   The nicknames used for area identification need to be advertised and
   acquired through Level 2.

   Within an area, all the border TRILL switches can discover each other
   through the Level 1 link state database, by using the IS-IS attach
   bit or by explicitly advertising in their LSP "I am a border
   RBridge".

   Of the border TRILL switches, one will have highest priority (say
   RB7). RB7 can dynamically participate, in Level 2, to acquire a
   nickname for identifying the area.  Alternatively, RB7 could give the
   area a pseudonode IS-IS ID, such as RB7.5, within Level 2.  So an
   area would appear, in Level 2, as a pseudonode and the pseudonode
   could participate, in Level 2, to acquire a nickname for the area.

   Within Level 2, all the border TRILL switches for an area can
   advertise reachability to the area, which would mean connectivity to
   a nickname identifying the area.



2.6 Link State Representation of Areas

   Within an area, say area A1, there is an election for the DBRB,
   (Designated Border RBridge), say RB1.  This can be done through LSPs
   within area A1.  The border TRILL switches announce themselves,
   together with their DBRB priority. (Note that the election of the
   DBRB cannot be done based on Hello messages, because the border TRILL
   switches are not necessarily physical neighbors of each other.  They
   can, however, reach each other through connectivity within the area,
   which is why it will work to find each other through Level 1 LSPs.)

   RB1 acquires an area nickname (in the aggregated nickname approach)
   and may give the area a pseudonode IS-IS ID (just like the DRB would
   give a pseudonode IS-IS ID to a link) depending on how the area
   nickname is handled.  RB1 advertises, in area A1, an area nickname
   that RB1 has acquired (and what the pseudonode IS-IS ID for the area
   is if needed).

   Level 1 LSPs (possibly pseudonode) initiated by RB1 for the area
   include any information external to area A1 that should be input into
   area A1 (such as nicknames of external areas, or perhaps (in the
   unique nickname variant) all the nicknames of external TRILL switches

   in the TRILL campus and pruning information such as multicast
   listeners and labels).  All the other border TRILL switches for the
   area announce (in their LSP) attachment to that area.

   Within Level 2, RB1 generates a Level 2 LSP on behalf of the area.
   The same pseudonode ID could be used within Level 1 and Level 2, for
   the area.  (There does not seem any reason why it would be useful for
   it to be different, but there's also no reason why it would need to
   be the same).  Likewise, all the area A1 border TRILL switches would
   announce, in their Level 2 LSPs, connection to the area.

3. Area Partition

   It is possible for an area to become partitioned, so that there is
   still a path from one section of the area to the other, but that path
   is via the Level 2 area.

   With multilevel TRILL, an area will naturally break into two areas in
   this case.

   Area addresses might be configured to ensure two areas are not
   inadvertently connected.  Area addresses appear in Hellos and LSPs
   within the area.  If two chunks, connected only via Level 2, were
   configured with the same area address, this would not cause any
   problems. (They would just operate as separate Level 1 areas.)

   A more serious problem occurs if the Level 2 area is partitioned in
   such a way that it could be healed by using a path through a Level 1
   area. TRILL will not attempt to solve this problem. Within the Level
   1 area, a single border RBridge will be the DBRB, and will be in
   charge of deciding which (single) RBridge will transition any
   particular multi-destination packets between that area and Level 2.
   If the Level 2 area is partitioned, this will result in multi-
   destination data only reaching the portion of the TRILL campus
   reachable through the partition attached to the TRILL switch that
   transitions that packet.  It will not cause a loop.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                          Multilevel TRILL


4. Multi-Destination Scope

   There are at least two reasons it would be desirable to be able to
   mark a multi-destination packet with a scope that indicates the
   packet should not exit the area, as follows:

   1. To address an issue in the border learning variant of the
      aggregated nickname alternative, when a unicast packet turns into
      a multi-destination packet when transitioning from Level 2 to
      Level 1, as discussed in Section 4.1.

   2. To constrain the broadcast domain for certain discovery,
      directory, or service protocols as discussed in Section 4.2.

   Multi-destination packet distribution scope restriction could be done
   in a number of ways. For example, there could be a flag in the packet
   that means "for this area only". However, the technique that might
   require the least change to TRILL switch fast path logic would be to
   indicate this in the egress nickname that designates the distribution
   tree being used. There could be two general tree nicknames for each
   tree, one being for distribution restricted to the area and the other
   being for multi-area trees. Or there would be a set of N (perhaps 16)
   special currently reserved nicknames used to specify the N highest
   priority trees but with the variation that if the special nickname is
   used for the tree, the packet is not transitioned between areas. Or
   one or more special trees could be built that were restricted to the
   local area.



4.1 Unicast to Multi-destination Conversions

   In the border learning variant of the aggregated nickname
   alternative, a unicast packet might be known at the Level 1 to Level
   2 transition, be forwarded as a unicast packet to the least cost
   border TRILL switch advertising connectivity to the destination area,
   but turn out to have an unknown destination { MAC, Data Label } pair
   when it arrives at that border TRILL switch.

   In this case, the packet must be converted into a multi-destination
   packet and flooded in the destination area.  However, if the border
   TRILL switch doing the conversion is not the border TRILL switch
   designated to transition the resulting multi-destination packet,
   there is the danger that the designated transitioner may pick up the
   packet and flood it back into Level 2 from which it may be flooded
   into multiple areas.  This danger can be avoided by restricting any
   multi-destination packet that results from such a conversion to the
   destination area through a flag in the packet or though distributing
   it on a tree that is restricted to the area, or other techniques (see
   Section 4).


R. Perlman, et al                                              [Page 19]

INTERNET-DRAFT                                          Multilevel TRILL


   Alternatively, a multi-destination packet intended only for the area
   could be tunneled (within the area) to the RBridge RBx, that is the
   appointed transitioner for that form of packet (say, based on VLAN or
   FGL), with instructions that RBx only transmit the packet within the
   area, and RBx could initiate the multi-destination packet within the
   area.  Since RBx introduced the packet, and is the only one allowed
   to transition that packet to Level 2, this would accomplish scoping
   of the packet to within the area.  Since this case only occurs in the
   unusual case when unicast packets need to be turned into multi-
   destination as described above, the suboptimality of tunneling
   between the border TRILL switch that receives the unicast packet and
   the appointed level transitioner for that packet, would not be an
   issue.



4.1.1 New Tree Encoding

   The current encoding, in a TRILL header, of a tree, is of the
   nickname of the tree root. This requires all 16 bits of the egress
   nickname field. TRILL could instead, for example, use the bottom 6
   bits to encode the tree number (allowing 64 trees), leaving 10 bits
   to encode information such as:

   o  scope: a flag indicating whether it should be single area only, or
      entire campus
   o  border injector: an indicator of which of the k border TRILL
      switches injected this packet

   If TRILL were to adopt this new encoding, any of the TRILL switches
   in an edge group could inject a multi-destination packet. This would
   require all TRILL switches to be changed to understand the new
   encoding for a tree, and it would require a TLV in the LSP to
   indicate which number each of the TRILL switches in an edge group
   would be.



4.2 Selective Broadcast Domain Reduction

   There are a number of service, discovery, and directory protocols
   that, for convenience, are accessed via multicast or broadcast
   frames. Examples are DHCP, (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) the
   NetBIOS Service Location Protocol, and multicast DNS (Domain Name
   Service).

   Some such protocols provide means to restrict distribution to an IP
   subnet or equivalent to reduce size of the broadcast domain they are
   using and then provide a proxy that can be placed in that subnet to
   use unicast to access a service elsewhere. In cases where a proxy

INTERNET-DRAFT                                          Multilevel TRILL


   mechanism is not currently defined, it may be possible to create one
   that references a central server or cache. With multilevel TRILL, it
   is possible to construct very large IP subnets that could become
   saturated with multi-destination traffic of this type unless packets
   can be further restricted in their distribution. Such restricted
   distribution can be accomplished for some protocols, say protocol P,
   in a variety of ways including the following:

   -  Either (1) at all ingress TRILL switches in an area place all
      protocol P multi-destination packets on a distribution tree in
      such a way that the packets are restricted to the area or (2) at
      all border TRILL switches between that area and Level 2, detect
      protocol P multi-destination packets and do not transition them.

   -  Then place one, or a few for redundancy, protocol P proxies inside
      each area where protocol P may be in use. These proxies unicast
      protocol P requests or other messages to the actual campus
      server(s) for P. They also receive unicast responses or other
      messages from those servers and deliver them within the area via
      unicast, multicast, or broadcast as appropriate. (Such proxies
      would not be needed if it was acceptable for all protocol P
      traffic to be restricted to an area.)

   While it might seem logical to connect the campus servers to TRILL
   switches in Level 2, they could be placed within one or more areas so
   that, in some cases, those areas might not require a local proxy
   server.

5. Co-Existence with Old TRILL switches

   TRILL switches that are not multilevel aware may have a problem with
   calculating RPF Check and filtering information, since they would not
   be aware of the assignment of border TRILL switch transitioning.

   A possible solution, as long as any old TRILL switches exist within
   an area, is to have the border TRILL switches elect a single DBRB
   (Designated Border RBridge), and have all inter-area traffic go
   through the DBRB (unicast as well as multi-destination).  If that
   DBRB goes down, a new one will be elected, but at any one time, all
   inter-area traffic (unicast as well as multi-destination) would go
   through that one DRBR. However this eliminates load splitting at
   level transition.

6. Multi-Access Links with End Stations

   Care must be taken, in the case where there are multiple TRILL
   switches on a link with end stations, that only one TRILL switch
   ingress/egress any given data packet from/to the end nodes. With
   existing, single level TRILL, this is done by electing a single
   Designated RBridge per link, which appoints a single Appointed
   Forwarder per VLAN [RFC7177] [RFC6439].  But suppose there are two
   (or more) TRILL switches on a link in different areas, say RB1 in
   area 1000 and RB2 in area 2000, and that the link contains end nodes.
   If RB1 and RB2 ignore each other's Hellos then they will both
   ingress/egress end node traffic from the link.

   A simple rule is to use the TRILL switch or switches having the
   lowest numbered area, comparing area numbers as unsigned integers, to
   handle native traffic. This would automatically give multilevel-
   ignorant legacy TRILL switches, that would be using area number zero,
   highest priority for handling end stations, which they would try to
   do anyway.

   Other methods are possible. For example doing the selection of
   Appointed Forwarders and of the TRILL switch in charge of that
   selection across all TRILL switches on the link regardless of area.
   However, a special case would then have to be made in any case for
   legacy TRILL switches using area number zero.

   Any of these techniques require multilevel aware RBridges to take
   actions based on Hellos from RBridges in other areas even though they
   will not form an adjacency with such RBridges.

7. Summary

   This draft discusses issues and possible approaches to multilevel
   TRILL.  The alternative using aggregated areas has significant
   advantages in terms of scalability over using campus wide unique
   nicknames, not just in avoiding nickname exhaustion, but by allowing
   RPF Checks to be aggregated based on an entire area. However, the
   alternative of using unique nicknames is simpler and avoids the
   changes in border TRILL switches required to support aggregated
   nicknames.  It is possible to support both. For example, a TRILL
   campus could use simpler unique nicknames until scaling begins to
   cause problems and then start to introduce areas with aggregated
   nicknames.

   Some issues are not difficult, such as dealing with partitioned
   areas.  Other issues are more difficult, especially dealing with old
   TRILL switches.
