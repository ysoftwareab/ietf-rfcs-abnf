1.  The SNMP Management Framework

  The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
  components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
       STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
       1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
       in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
       STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
       the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
       track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
       [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
       message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
       [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
       protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
       RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
       [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
       in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

  A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
  can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
  the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
  defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
  MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
  translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
  equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
  translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
  information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
  SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
  readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
  MIB.

2. Entity State

   The goal in adding state objects to the Entity MIB was to define a
   useful subset of the possible state attributes that could be tracked
   for a given entity that both fit into the existing IETF model, as
   well as leveraged existing well deployed models.  The entStateTable
   contains state objects that are a subset of ITU's X.731 state
   objects. Objects are defined to capture administrative, operational
   and usage states. In addition there are further state objects
   defined to provide additional information for these three basic
   states.

   Administrative state indicates permission to use or prohibition
   against using the entity and is imposed through the management
   services. The administrative state defined for an entity is
   independent of administrative states in its containment hierarchy.
   This means that administratively locking an entity does not
   automatically lock its children in the containment hierarchy.

   Operational state indicates whether or not the entity is physically
   installed and working. The operational state defined for an entity
   is indirectly dependent on the operational state of the entities in
   which it is contained. If its parent entities in its containment
   hierarchy are disabled, and therefore totally inoperable, then it is
   unlikely that the given entity will be operable.

   Usage state indicates whether or not the entity is in use at a
   specific instance, and if so, whether or not it currently has spare
   capacity.

   The terms state and status are used interchangeably in this memo.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.1 State Relationships


   The following section outlines all of the combinations of the three
   basic states - administrative, operational and usage -and briefly
   describes what each of these combinations of states means. It also
   compare this combination of states to that of the ifAdminStatus and
   ifOperStatus objects of the Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863] to both
   provide insight to those familiar with these status objects as well
   as to clarify the relationship between entities and interfaces, as
   indicated by entAliasLogicalIndexOrZero.

                            Entity State MIB                October 2002


2.1.1 Admin State Locked, Operational State Disabled and Usage State Idle

   The entity is totally inoperable, it is not servicing any users and
   it is also administratively prohibited from use. To make it
   available for use, both management permission and some corrective
   action are necessary. This is similar to an ifAdminStatus of down
   and ifOperStatus of down.

2.1.2 Admin State Locked, Operational State Enabled and Usage State Idle

   The entity is partially or fully operable, it is not servicing any
   users but is administratively prohibited from use. To make it
   available for use, only management permission is required. This is
   similar to an ifAdminStatus of down and ifOperStatus of down.	

2.1.3 Admin State Shutting Down, Operational State Enabled and Usage State
Active

   The entity is partially or fully operable and in use, but usage is
   administratively limited to current instances of use. For an
   additional user to gain access, management permission is required.
   Otherwise, when all current users have terminated their use of the
   resource, the managed object will automatically transit to the
   locked, enabled, and idle state. This is similar to the situation
   described in [RFC2863] where ifAdminStatus transitions to down, but
   the ifOperStatus's transition does not occur immediately, but rather
   after a small time lag to complete certain operations before going
   "down".	

2.1.4 Admin State Shutting Down, Operational State Enabled and Usage State
Busy

   The entity is partially or fully operable and in use, but usage is
   administratively limited to current instances of use. In addition,
   it has no spare capacity to provide for additional users. For an
   additional user to gain access, besides waiting for an existing user
   to terminate, management permission is also required. Otherwise,
   when all current users have terminated their use of the resource,

   the managed object will automatically transit to the locked,
   enabled, idle state. This is similar to the situation described in
   [RFC2863] where ifAdminStatus transitions to down, but the
   ifOperStatus's transition does not occur immediately, but rather
   after a small time lag to complete certain operations before going
   "down".

2.1.5 Admin State Unlocked, Operational State Enabled and Usage State Idle

   The entity is partially or fully operable, it is not actually in use
   and is not administratively prohibited from use. This is similar to
   an ifAdminStatus of up and ifOperStatus of up if the interface is
   able to pass packets. If the interface is found to be operable, but
   the interface is waiting for other,  external, events to occur
   before it can transmit or receive  packets, then this is similar to


Chisholm                    Standards Track                    [Page 5]	
                            Entity State MIB                October 2002


   an ifAdminStatus of up and a ifOperStatus of dormant.

2.1.6 Admin State Unlocked, Operational State Enabled and Usage State Active

   The entity is partially or fully operable, it is currently in use
   and is not

   administratively prohibited from use. It has sufficient spare
   capacity to provide for additional users. This is similar to an
   ifAdminStatus of up and ifOperStatus of up.	

2.1.7 Admin State Unlocked, Operational State Enabled and Usage State Busy

   The entity is partially or fully operable, it is currently in use
   and it is not administratively prohibited from use. Currently it has
   no spare capacity to provide for additional users. For an additional
   user to gain access, it is necessary to wait for an existing user to
   terminate or for some capacity increase to occur.  This is similar
   to an ifAdminStatus of up and ifOperStatus of up.

2.1.8 Admin State Unlocked, Operational State Disabled and Usage State Idle

   The entity is totally inoperable, it is servicing no users but it is
   not administratively prohibited from use. To make it available for
   use, some corrective action is required. This is similar to an
   ifAdminStatus of up and ifOperStatus of down. If the cause of the
   interface being down is because of a lower layer being down, then
   this is similar to an ifAdminStatus of up and an ifOperStatus of
   lowerLayerDown.

2.2 Physical Classes and States

2.2.1 Chassis

   A value of unlocked for entStateAdmin means that this system is on.
   A value of shuttingDown for entStateAdmin means that this system is
   in the process of shutting down. A value of enabled for entStateOper
   indicates that basic functions of this system are functioning. A
   value of disabled for entStateOper indicates a problem with basic
   functions on the system. A value of idle for entStateUsage may not
   make sense since responding to a SNMP query may constitute service.
   A value of active for entStateUsage indicates the system is
   functioning, but is able to provide more services. A value of busy
   for entStateUsage indicates that the system is functioning at
   maximum capacity and is unable to provide more services at the
   present time.

   A value of hotStandby for enStateStandby indicates that the entire
   system contained within this chassis is running as a hot standby for
   another complete system, possibly contained within the same stack. A
   value of coldStandby for enStateStandby indicates that the entire
   system contained within this chassis is running as a cold standby


Chisholm                    Standards Track                    [Page 6]	
                            Entity State MIB                October 2002


   for another complete system, possibly contained within the same
   stack. A value of providingService for enStateStandby indicates that
   the entire system contained within this chassis is currently
   providing service.

   If this chassis is not contained in within a stack, the alarm counts
   indicated by entStateAlarm will be those alarms that are against the
   general system, as appose sub-components within the containment
   hierarchy.

2.2.2 BackPlane

   A value of unlocked for entStateAdmin means that the backplane is
   not administratively prevented from aggregating and forwarding
   network traffic. A value of shutting down for entStateAdmin means
   that the backplane will finish aggregating and forwarding the
   network traffic is currently handling, but then transition to be
   administratively locked. A value of locked for entStateAdmin means
   that backplane is administratively prohibited from aggregating and
   forwarding any network traffic. A value of enabled for entStateOper
   means that the backplane is partially or fully capable of
   aggregating and forwarding network traffic. A value of disabled for
   entStateOper means that the backplane is unable to aggregate and
   forward any network traffic. A value of idle for entStateUsage means
   that the backplane is not currently aggregating and forwarding any
   network traffic. A value of active for entStateUsage means that the
   backplane is currently aggregating and forwarding some network
   traffic, but has capacity to handle more traffic. A value of busy
   for entStateUsage means that the backplane is aggregating and
   forwarding network traffic at full capacity.

   A value of hotStandby for enStateStandby indicates that the
   backplane is running as a hot standby for another backplane within
   this system. A value of coldStandby for enStateStandby indicates
   that the backplane is running as a cold standby for another
   backplane, possibly within this system. A value of providingService
   for enStateStandby indicates that the backplane is currently
   providing service. Looking at the entStateAlarm gives a convenient
   way to see if there are any alarms currently active against this
   backplane.

2.2.3 Container

   A value of unlocked for entStateAdmin means it is administratively
   possible to insert things into this container. A value of
   shuttingDown for entStateAdmin could be used to reflect that
   inserting objects into this container is administratively
   prohibited. This value could also be used for systems that do not
   support hot insertion of components.

   The container physical class could be used to indicate, among other
   things, chassis slots or daughter-card holders. If the container is


Chisholm                    Standards Track                    [Page 7]	
                            Entity State MIB                October 2002


   empty, for example it has no modules in its slots, then
   entStateUsage would have a value of idle. If the container is
   partially used, for example it has modules in some but now all of
   its slots, then entStateUsage would have a value of busy. If the
   container is full, for example it has no empty slots, then
   entStateUsage would have a value of busy.

   If it is not possible to raise alarms against this chassis, the
   entStateAlarm will have no alarms set. It may not make sense for the
   entStateOper to have values other than enabled.

2.2.4 PowerSupply

   If this power supply is the currently providing power to the system,
   then entStateStandyby would have a value of providing service. If
   this power supply is serving as a backup to a primary power supply,
   then entStateStandyby would have a value of hotstandby.

   A value of locked for entStateAdmin means that the power supply has
   been turned off. This only makes sense in the situation where there
   is a backup power supply. A value of unlocked for entStateAdmin
   means that the power supply is turned on. A value of enabled for
   entStateOper means that the power supply is operational. A value of
   disabled for entStateOper means that the power supply is not
   functioning. A value of idle for entStateUsage means that the power
   supply is providing no power to the system. A value of active for
   entStateUsage means that the power supply is providing power to the
   system, but could possibly provide more. A value of busy for
   entStateUsage means that the power supply is providing the maximum
   power to the system that it is capable of. Looking at the
   entStateAlarm gives a convenient way to see if there are any alarms
   currently active against this power supply.

2.2.5 Fan

   If this fan is serving as a backup to a primary fan, then
   entStateStandyby would have a value of hotstandby. If this fan is
   the currently providing service to the system, then entStateStandyby
   would have a value of providing service. A value of idle for
   entStateUsage would indicate that the fan was not actually running.
   A value of active for entStateUsage would indicate that the fan was
   running, but not at its maximum capacity. A value of busy for
   entStateUsage would indicate that the fan was running at maximum
   capacity.

   Looking at the entStateAdmin and entStateOper provide useful
   information to determine why a fan is not running. A value of locked
   for entStateAdmin means that the fan is not running because it has
   been administratively disabled. A value of disabled for the
   entOperStatus indicates that the fan itself is not operational. A
   value of enabled for the entOperStatus indicates that the fan is
   working in theory and that cause of it not operator may lie


Chisholm                    Standards Track                    [Page 8]	
                            Entity State MIB                October 2002


   elsewhere. Looking at the entStateAlarm gives a convenient way to
   see if there are any alarms currently active against this fan.

2.2.6 Sensor

   A value of unlocked for entStateAdmin indicates that the sensor is
   not administratively prohibited from sensing. A value of shutting
   down for entStateAdmin indicates that the sensor will complete its
   current readings and then shut down. A value of locked for
   entStateAdmin indicates that the sensor is administratively
   prohibited from sensing. A value of enabled for entStateOper
   indicates that the sensor is functioning properly. A value of
   disable for entStateOper indicates that the sensor is totally
   inoperable. A value of idle for entStateUsage indicates that the
   sensor is not currently sensing. A value of active for entStateUsage
   indicates that the sensor is currently sensing things, but could
   sense more, more often or other types of information for example. A
   value of busy for entStateUsage indicates that the sensor is sensing
   everything it knows how to sense and at its fastest possible rate.

   Looking at the entStateStandby indicates whether this sensor is
   currently providing service or acting as a backup for another
   sensor. Looking at the entStateAlarm gives a convenient way to see
   if there are any alarms currently active against this sensor.

2.2.7 Module

   For modules that support the functionality of being administratively
   disabled, entStateAdmin object indicates whether the module is
   administratively locked (disabled) or unlocked (enabled). Modules
   that do not support disabling will always have a value of unlocked
   for entStateAdmin. A value of enabled for entStateOper indicates
   that this module is partially or fully operational. A value of
   disabled for entStateOper indicates that this module is totally
   inoperable. A value of idle for entStateUsage indicates that this
   module is currently not performing any functions. A value of active
   entStateUsage indicates that this module is currently performing
   functions, but capable of performing more. A value of busy for
   entStateUsage indicates that the module is functioning at full
   capacity and unable to perform further functions at this current
   time.

   Looking at the entStateStandby indicates whether this module is
   currently providing service or acting as a backup for another
   module. Looking at the entStateAlarm gives a convenient way to see
   if there are any alarms currently active against this module.

2.2.8 Port

   A value of enabled for entStateAdmin means the port is not
   administratively prohibited from passing network traffic. A value of
   shutting down for entStateAdmin indicates that the port will pass


Chisholm                    Standards Track                    [Page 9]	
                            Entity State MIB                October 2002


   its current traffic and then transition to the locked state. A value
   of locked for entStateAdmin indicates that the port is
   administratively prohibited from passing network traffic. A value of
   enabled for entStateOper means that the port is partially or fully
   capable of forwarding network traffic. A value of disabled for
   entStateOper means that the port is totally unable to forward
   network traffic. A value of idle for entStateUsage indicates that
   the port is not currently forwarding any network traffic. A value of
   active means that the port is currently forwarding network traffic,
   but has capacity to forward more. A value of busy for entStateUsage
   indicates that the port is forwarding network traffic at its maximum
   capacity.

   Looking at the entStateStandby indicates whether this port is
   currently providing service or acting as a backup for another port.
   Looking at the entStateAlarm gives a convenient way to see if there
   are any alarms currently active against this port.

2.2.9 Stack

   A value of unlocked for entStateAdmin means that this system is on.
   A value of shuttingDown for entStateAdmin means that this system is
   in the process of shutting down. A value of enabled for entStateOper
   indicates that basic functions of this system are functioning. A
   value of disabled for entStateOper indicates a problem with basic
   functions on the system. A value of idle for entStateUsage may not
   make sense since responding to a SNMP query may constitute service.
   A value of active for entStateUsage indicates the system is
   functioning, but is able to provide more services. A value of busy
   for entStateUsage indicates that the system is functioning at
   maximum capacity and is unable to provide more services at the
   present time.

   A value of hotStandby for enStateStandby indicates that the entire
   system contained within this stack is running as a hot standby for
   another complete system, possibly contained within the same parent
   stack. A value of coldStandby for enStateStandby indicates that the
   entire system contained within this stack is running as a cold
   standby for another complete system, possibly contained within the
   same parent stack. A value of providingService for enStateStandby
   indicates that the entire system contained within this chassis is
   currently providing service.

   If this stack is not contained in within a parent stack, the alarm
   counts indicated by entStateAlarm will be those alarms that are
   against the general system, as appose sub-components within the
   containment hierarchy.

2.3 Relation to Alarm MIB

   The entStateAlarm object indicates whether or not there are any
   active alarms against this entity. If there are active alarms, then
   the alarmActiveTable should be searched for alarmActiveResourceId
   that match this entPhysicalIndex

4. Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB
   is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
   alter or create any management objects of this MIB via direct SNMP
   SET operations.
