            Subsequent Address Family Indicator for SDWAN Ports
                    draft-dunbar-idr-sdwan-port-safi-01

Abstract

   The document specifies a new BGP NLRI and SAFI for advertising
   properties of a SDWAN edge node WAN ports that face untrusted
   networks, such as the public internet. Those WAN ports may get
   assigned IP addresses from the Internet Service Providers (ISPs),
   may get assigned dynamic IP addresses via DHCP, or may have private
   addresses (e.g. inside third party Cloud DCs). Packets sent over
   those SDWAN WAN ports might need to be encrypted (depending on the
   user policies) or need to go through NAT. SDWAN edge need to
   propagate those WAN ports properties to its SDWAN controller, which
   propagates to the authorized peers and manage the IPsec SAs among
   those peers for encrypting traffic via the untrusted networks.

   BGP Route Reflectors (RR) are proposed as points of combination for
   this information in order to allow scaling of the SDWAN.

1. Introduction

   [Net2Cloud-Problem] introduces using SDWAN to reach workloads in
   dynamic third party data centers and aggregate multiple underlay
   paths, including public untrusted networks, provided by different
   service providers. However, scaling the combination of routes and
   IPsec SAs key management can be an issue when the number of nodes
   interconnected by the SDWAN overlay paths reaches 10,000 to 100,000
   nodes.

   [SDWAN-BGP-USAGE] describes multiple SDWAN scenarios and how/why
   using BGP as control plane for the SDWAN networks.

   This document describes a new BGP NLRI and SAFI to advertise
   properties of WAN ports facing the public internet. This new SAFI &
   NLRI is for the Scenario #2 of the [SDWAN-BGP-USAGE] where one
   "SDWAN" edge node having multiple ports some of which connected to
   private networks and others connected to public untrusted networks.
   The packets sent over the private networks can go natively without
   encryption (for better performance), only the packets sent over the
   public networks needs IPsec SA.

   The new SAFI and NLRI are for advertising the properties of WAN
   ports facing public untrusted networks, through which data packets
   have to be encrypted using IPsec.

   The [SDWAN-BGP-USAGE] document describes the three functional tiers
   for the control plane of SDWAN Scenario #2:

      . Tier 1 (Edge Router of SDWAN): Each Edge SDWAN router
         registers with the SDWAN Controller using a secure connection
         (e.g. TLS).  During the registration process, the controller
         may suggest a specific BGP RR peer for the Edge SDWAN router
         to exchange BGP route with.

         After registering, each Edge Router sends routes + SDWAN WAN
         ports information (NAT and security information) via the SDWAN

         SAFI + NLRI to the BGP RR.  Due to the sensitivity of the
         information, the BGP peering session MUST be configured to run
         over a Secure TCP (TLS).

      . Tier 2: Route Reflector that combines information from the
         security information from the SDWAN controller, the WAN ports
         properties from SDWAN edge routers, and

      . Tier 3: Client routes distribution, just like EVPN or L3VPN,
         except including additional paths over the WAN ports facing
         the public Internet.

   Traffic go through the private networks links natively without
   encryption and are encrypted when sent out the WAN ports facing
   public Internet.

   The BGP peers use a new BGP NLRI and SAFI to pass the SDWAN Internet
   WAN ports properties, such as NAT and security association (SA).
   This information includes the Port-ID and port related NAT
   information, SDWAN-SITE-ID, SDWAN Node-ID, and IPsec security
   information.

               "SDWAN" refers to the solutions of pooling WAN bandwidth
               from multiple underlay networks to get better WAN
               bandwidth management, visibility & control. When the
               underlay networks are private networks, traffic can
               traverse without additional encryption; when the
               underlay networks are public, such as Internet, some
               traffic needs to be encrypted when traversing through
               (depending on user provided policies).



3. SDWAN NLRI Format

   The new SAFI code point 74 has been assigned by IANA as the
   Subsequent Address Family Identifier for advertising properties of
   WAN ports that face untrusted networks. Depending on user policies,
   some packets through those WAN ports will need encryption.

   The SDWAN SAFI (code point 74 assigned by IANA) uses a new NLRI
   defined as follows:

   |  SDWAN-Site-ID   | 4 octets
   +------------------+
   |  SDWAN-Node-ID   | 4 or 16 octets
   +------------------+



   where:

     - NLRI Length: 1 octet of length expressed in bits as defined in
       [RFC4760].
     - SDWAN-Type: to define the encoding of the rest of the SDWAN
       NLRI.
     - Port Distinguisher: SDWAN node Port identifier. There can be
       many ports on a SDWAN node; each port can have different
       properties. For example, some ports may get ISP or DHCP assigned
       IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6), some may have private IP addresses
       that packets to/from those ports have to traverse NAT.
       The detailed properties about the port are further encoded in
       the subsequent subTLVs, e.g. Port-subTLV.

     - SDWAN-Site-ID: used to identify a common property shared by a
       set of SDWAN nodes, such as the property of a specific
       geographic location shared by a group of SDWAN nodes.
     - SDWAN Node ID: the SDWAN node identifier, which can be the
       node's system ID or the loopback address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the
       SDWAN node.

   The content of the SDWAN Port properties is encoded in the Tunnel
   Encapsulation Attribute originally defined in [Tunnel-Encap] using a
   new Tunnel-Type TLV (code point to be assigned by IANA from the "BGP
   Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute Tunnel Types" registry).

3.1. SDWAN Route Type

   A new Route Type that defines the encoding of the rest of the SDWAN
   NLRI, and a set of sub-TLVs to specify its end-point attributes,
   policies associated with the Ports:

Internet-Draft       SAFI for SDWAN WAN Properties           March 2019



3.2. Port Distinguisher

   One (SDWAN) node can have multiple ports, and each port can support
   multiple IPsec SA to different peers. The Port Distinguisher is to
   uniquely identify a port (or link).

   The property of the port are encoded in the subTLV attached to the
   SDWAN NLRI:

     a) The IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) & AS number of the Port
     b) NAT information for ports with Private IP address
     c) IPsec Security Association related information if the port is
        facing public network and traffic through which have to be
        encrypted.
   Detailed encoding for those properties are described in Section 3.4
   & Section 3.5 respectively.

3.3. SDWAN Site ID

   SDWAN Site ID is used to identify a common property shared by a set
   of SDWAN nodes/ports, such as the property of a specific geographic
   location. The property is used to steer an overlay route to traverse
   specific geographic locations for various reasons, such as to comply
   regulatory rules, to utilize specific value added services, or
   others.



3.4. Extended Port Property

   EncapExt sub-TLV is for describing additional information about a
   SDWAN port, such as the NAT property if the port has private
   address, the network identifier that the port is part of, etc.

   A SDWAN edge node can inquire STUN (Session Traversal of UDP Through
   Network Address Translation RFC 3489) Server to get the NAT
   property, the public IP address and the Public Port number to pass
   to peers.

     o IPsec-SA SubTLV Type: to be assigned by IANA. The type value
        has to be between 128~255 because IPsec-SA subTLV needs 2 bytes
        for length to carry the needed information.
     o IPsec-SA subTLV Length (2 Byte): 25 (or more)

     o Flags: 1 octet of flags. None are defined at this stage. Flags
        SHOULD be set to zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on
        receipt.
     o Transform (1 Byte):  the value can be AH, ESP, or AH+ESP.
     o Transport (1 byte): the value can be Tunnel Mode or Transport
        mode
     o AH (1 byte): AH authentication algorithms supported, which can
        be md5 | sha1 | sha2-256 | sha2-384 | sha2-512 | sm3. Each
        SDWAN node can have multiple authentication algorithms; send to
        its peers to negotiate the strongest one.
     o ESP (1 byte): ESP authentication algorithms supported, which
        can be md5 | sha1 | sha2-256 | sha2-384 | sha2-512 | sm3. Each
        SDWAN node can have multiple authentication algorithms; send to
        its peers to negotiate the strongest one. Default algorithm is
        AES-256.
     o SPI: 4 bytes
     o Key1.AH authentication key
     o Key2.ESP authentication key
     o Key3.ESP encryption "public" key
     o Duration: SA life span.

3.6. Remote Endpoint

   The Remote Endpoint sub-TLV is not used for SDWAN NLRI because
     o The network to which a SDWAN port is connected might have
        identifier that is more than the AS number. SDWAN controller
        might use its own specific identifier for the network.
     o The Transport-Network-ID in the EncapExt sub-TLV represents the
        SDWAN unique network identifier.

     If the Remote Endpoint Sub-TLV is present, it is ignored by other
     SDWAN nodes.


4. Operation of SDWAN routers:

   The processing steps on CPE1 to announce the SDWAN combination of
   routes, NAT and IPsec information via BGP are:

   1. Advertise the SDWAN capability information and port properties,
   such as Port identifiers and supported properties etc. to RR via the
   SDWAN SAFI NLRI.



   2.  RR propagate the information to CPE2 & CPE 3.

   3. CPE2 and CPE3 can choose to establish IPsec SA with the CPE1
   after receiving the CPE1 WAN properties from RR.



   Note: Tenant separation is achieved by different SDWAN nodes being
   added to different Peer Group.



4. Manageability Considerations

      TBD - this needs to be filled out before publishing

5. Security Considerations

     The document is to address how SDWAN nodes advertise its SDWAN
     capability to their peers via untrusted & unsecure networks.

     The secure propagation is achieved by secure channels, such as
     TLS, SSL, or IPsec, between the SDWAN nodes and the local
     controller RR.

    [More details need to be filled in here]


6. IANA Considerations

   This document requires the following IANA actions.

       o SDWAN Overlay SAFI = 74 assigned by IANA
       o SDWAN Route Type
