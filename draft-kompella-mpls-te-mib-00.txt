2. Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects
   for Traffic Engineered Multi-Protocol Label Switched Paths ([1],
   [2]).

3. Introduction

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes managed objects
   for Traffic Engineered Multi-Protocol Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
   ([1], [2]).


4. The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

      o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [3].

      o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
         purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
         Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
         STD 16, RFC 1155 [4], STD 16, RFC 1212 [5] and RFC 1215 [6].
         The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, which
         consists of RFC 2578 [7], RFC 2579 [8] and RFC 2580 [9].

      o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
         first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
         described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [10].  A second version of the
         SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
         protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [11] and
         RFC 1906 [12].  The third version of the message protocol is
         called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [12], RFC 2572 [13] and
         RFC 2574 [14].

      o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
         first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
         described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [10].  A second set of protocol
         operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
         [15].

      o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [16]
         and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
         2575 [17].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [18].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

Internet Draft      draft-kompella-mpls-te-mib-00.txt          July 2000


   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this
   loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the
   semantics of the MIB.


4.1. Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
   the object type.


5. Overview of the MIB

   The MIB for Traffic Engineered LSPs consists of three parts:
      1) general MPLS information;
      2) Traffic Engineering information; and
      3) LSP information.

   The following subsections give an overview of each part.

   Note that currently, the MIB is organised as a read-only MIB.  At
   some future point, some of the information will be writable, i.e.,
   configurable through SNMP.


5.1. General MPLS Information

   This part contains information about the signaling protocols
   supported, and the number of configured and active TE LSPs.

Internet Draft      draft-kompella-mpls-te-mib-00.txt          July 2000


5.2. Traffic Engineering Information

   This part contains information about the Link State Protocols used to
   carry TE information, and a mapping of Administrative Group numbers
   to names.


5.3. LSP Information

   This part contains a list of LSPs and information about each one.
   This information includes the LSP name, its configuration
   information, its operational information, as well as information
   about the paths defined for the LSP.

   Configuration information includes the "from" and "to" addresses, and
   the number of configured paths.

   Operational information includes the current state (up/down), the
   count of octets and packets sent on the LSP, how long it has been up,
   and how many state transitions the LSP has had.

   Path information includes the name, the Explicit Route, the
   bandwidth, the setup and hold priorities, the Administrative Group
   constraints, and the Class of Service (CoS).

   Operational path information includes the Recorded Route, the number
   of operational paths, the number of path changes, and when the last
   path change was.
