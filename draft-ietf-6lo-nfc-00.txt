       Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Near Field Communication
                         draft-ietf-6lo-nfc-00

Abstract

   Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones
   and portable devices to establish radio communication with each other
   by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no
   more than 10 cm.  NFC standards cover communications protocols and
   data exchange formats, and are based on existing radio-frequency
   identification (RFID) standards including ISO/IEC 14443 and FeliCa.
   The standards include ISO/IEC 18092 and those defined by the NFC
   Forum.  The NFC technology has been widely implemented and available
   in mobile phones, laptop computers, and many other devices.  This
   document describes how IPv6 is transmitted over NFC using 6LowPAN
   techniques.

Internet-Draft                IPv6 over NFC                   March 2015


1.  Introduction

   NFC is a set of short-range wireless technologies, typically
   requiring a distance of 10 cm or less.  NFC operates at 13.56 MHz on
   ISO/IEC 18000-3 air interface and at rates ranging from 106 kbit/s to
   424 kbit/s.  NFC always involves an initiator and a target; the
   initiator actively generates an RF field that can power a passive
   target.  This enables NFC targets to take very simple form factors
   such as tags, stickers, key fobs, or cards that do not require
   batteries.  NFC peer-to-peer communication is possible, provided both
   devices are powered.  NFC builds upon RFID systems by allowing two-
   way communication between endpoints, where earlier systems such as
   contactless smart cards were one-way only.  It has been used in
   devices such as mobile phones, running Android operating system,
   named with a feature called "Android Beam".  In addition, it is
   expected for the other mobile phones, running the other operating
   systems (e.g., iOS, etc.) to be equipped with NFC technology in the
   near future.

   Considering the potential for exponential growth in the number of
   heterogeneous air interface technologies, NFC would be widely used as
   one of the other air interface technologies, such as Bluetooth Low
   Energy (BT-LE), Wi-Fi, and so on.  Each of the heterogeneous air
   interface technologies has its own characteristics, which cannot be
   covered by the other technologies, so various kinds of air interface
   technologies would be existing together.  Therefore, it is required
   for them to communicate each other.  NFC also has the strongest point
   (e.g., secure communication distance of 10 cm) to prevent the third
   party from attacking privacy.

   When the number of devices and things having different air interface
   technologies communicate each other, IPv6 is an ideal internet
   protocols owing to its large address space.  Also, NFC would be one
   of the endpoints using IPv6.  Therefore, This document describes how
   IPv6 is transmitted over NFC using 6LoWPAN techiques with following
   scopes.

   RFC4944 [1] specifies the transmission of IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4.
   The NFC link also has similar characteristics to that of IEEE
   802.15.4.  Many of the mechanisms defined in the RFC4944 [1] can be
   applied to the transmission of IPv6 on NFC links.  This document
   specifies the details of IPv6 transmission over NFC links.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [2].

3.  Overview of Near Field Communication Technology

   NFC technology enables simple and safe two-way interactions between
   electronic devices, allowing consumers to perform contactless
   transactions, access digital content, and connect electronic devices
   with a single touch.  NFC complements many popular consumer level
   wireless technologies, by utilizing the key elements in existing
   standards for contactless card technology (ISO/IEC 14443 A&B and
   JIS-X 6319-4).  NFC can be compatible with existing contactless card
   infrastructure and it enables a consumer to utilize one device across
   different systems.

   Extending the capability of contactless card technology, NFC also
   enables devices to share information at a distance that is less than
   10 cm with a maximum communication speed of 424 kbps.  Users can
   share business cards, make transactions, access information from a
   smart poster or provide credentials for access control systems with a
   simple touch.

   NFC's bidirectional communication ability is ideal for establishing
   connections with other technologies by the simplicity of touch.  In
   addition to the easy connection and quick transactions, simple data
   sharing is also available.

3.1.  Peer-to-peer Mode for IPv6 over NFC

   NFC-enabled devices are unique in that they can support three modes
   of operation: card emulation, peer-to-peer, and reader/writer.  Peer-
   to-peer mode enables two NFC-enabled devices to communicate with each
   other to exchange information and share files, so that users of NFC-
   enabled devices can quickly share contact information and other files
   with a touch.  Therefore, a NFC-enabled device can securely send IPv6
   packets to any corresponding node on the Internet when a NFC-enabled
   gateway is linked to the Internet.

3.2.  Protocol Stacks in IPv6 over NFC

   The IP protocol can use the services provided by Logical Link Control
   Protocol (LLCP) in the NFC stack to provide reliable, two-way
   transport of information between the peer devices.  Figure 1 depicts
   the NFC P2P protocol stack with IPv6 bindings to the LLCP.

   For data communication in IPv6 over NFC, an IPv6 packet SHALL be
   received at LLCP of NFC and transported to an Information Field in
   Protocol Data Unit (I PDU) of LLCP of the NFC-enabled peer device.
   Since LLCP does not support fragmentation and reassembly, Upper
   Layers SHOULD support fragmentation and reassembly.  For IPv6
   addressing or address configuration, LLCP SHALL provide related
   information, such as link layer addresses, to its upper layer.  LLCP
   to IPv6 protocol Binding SHALL transfer the SSAP and DSAP value to
   the IPv6 over NFC protocol.  SSAP stands for Source Service Access
   Point, which is 6-bit value meaning a kind of Logical Link Control
   (LLC) address, while DSAP means a LLC address of destination NFC-
   enabled device.

3.3.  NFC-enabled Device Addressing

   NFC-enabled devices are identified by 6-bit LLC address.  In other
   words, Any address SHALL be usable as both an SSAP and a DSAP
   address.  According to NFCForum-TS-LLCP_1.1 [3], address values
   between 0 and 31 (00h - 1Fh) SHALL be reserved for well-known service
   access points for Service Discovery Protocol (SDP).  Address values
   between 32 and 63 (20h - 3Fh) inclusively, SHALL be assigned by the
   local LLC as the result of an upper layer service request.

3.4.  NFC Packet Size and MTU

   As mentioned in Section 3.2, an IPv6 packet SHALL be received at LLCP
   of NFC and transported to an Information Field in Protocol Data Unit
   (I PDU) of LLCP of the NFC-enabled peer device.  The format of the I
   PDU SHALL be as shown in Figure 2.

      0      0    1      1    2    2
      0      6    0      6    0    4

                   Figure 2: Format of the I PDU in NFC

   The I PDU sequence field SHALL contain two sequence numbers: The send
   sequence number N(S) and the receive sequence number N(R).  The send
   sequence number N(S) SHALL indicate the sequence number associated
   with this I PDU.  The receive sequence number N(R) value SHALL
   indicate that I PDUs numbered up through N(R) - 1 have been received
   correctly by the sender of this I PDU and successfully passed to the
   senders SAP identified in the SSAP field.  These I PDUs SHALL be
   considered as acknowledged.

   The information field of an I PDU SHALL contain a single service data
   unit.  The maximum number of octets in the information field SHALL be
   determined by the Maximum Information Unit (MIU) for the data link
   connection.  The default value of the MIU for I PDUs SHALL be 128
   octets.  The local and remote LLCs each establish and maintain
   distinct MIU values for each data link connection endpoint.  Also, An
   LLC MAY announce a larger MIU for a data link connection by
   transmitting an MIUX extension parameter within the information
   field.

4.  Specification of IPv6 over NFC

   NFC technology sets also has considerations and requirements owing to
   low power consumption and allowed protocol overhead. 6LoWPAN
   standards RFC4944 [1], RFC6775 [4], and RFC6282 [5] provide useful
   functionality for reducing overhead which can be applied to BT-LE.
   This functionality comprises of link-local IPv6 addresses and
   stateless IPv6 address auto-configuration (see Section 4.3), Neighbor
   Discovery (see Section 4.4) and header compression (see Section 4.5).

   One of the differences between IEEE 802.15.4 and NFC is that the
   former supports both star and mesh topology (and requires a routing
   protocol), whereas NFC can support direct peer-to-peer connection and
   simple mesh-like topology depending on NFC application scenarios
   because of very short RF distance of 10 cm or less.

4.1.  Protocol Stack

   Figure 3 illustrates IPv6 over NFC.  Upper layer protocols can be
   transport protocols (TCP and UDP), application layer, and the others
   capable running on the top of IPv6.

4.2.  Link Model

   In the case of BT-LE, Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol
   (L2CAP) supports fragmentation and reassembly (FAR) functionality;
   therefore, adaptation layer for IPv6 over BT-LE do not have to
   conduct the FAR procedure.  However, NFC link layer is similar to
   IEEE 802.15.4.  Adaptation layer for IPv6 over NFC SHOULD support FAR
   functionality.  Therefore, fragmentation functionality as defined in
   RFC4944 [1] SHALL be used in NFC-enabled device networks.

   The NFC link between two communicating devices is considered to be a
   point-to-point link only.  Unlike in BT-LE, NFC link does not
   consider star topology and mesh network topology but peer-to-peer
   topology and simple multi-hop topology.  Due to this characteristics,
   6LoWPAN functionality, such as addressing and auto-configuration, and
   header compression, is specialized into NFC.

4.3.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

   A NFC-enabled device (i.e., 6LN) performs stateless address
   autoconfiguration as per RFC4862 [6].  A 64-bit Interface identifier
   (IID) for a NFC interface MAY be formed by utilizing the 6-bit NFC
   LLCP address (i.e., SSAP or DSAP) (see Section 3.3).  In the
   viewpoint of address configuration, such an IID MAY guarantee a
   stable IPv6 address because each data link connection is uniquely
   identified by the pair of DSAP and SSAP included in the header of
   each LLC PDU in NFC.

   Following the guidance of RFC7136 [10], interface IIDs of all unicast
   addresses for NFC-enabled devices are formed on the basis of 64 bits
   long and constructed in a modified EUI-64 format.  Therefore, this
   document provides a stateless address autoconf formation which
   suggests 58 zeros and 6 bit SSAP in the IID as shown in Figure 4.  In
   addition, the "Universal/Local" bit in the case of NFC-enabled device
   address MUST be set to 0 RFC4291 [7].  Only if the NFC-enabled device
   address is known to be a public address the "Universal/Local" bit can
   be set to 1.  The IPv6 link-local address for a NFC-enabled device is
   formed by appending the IID, to the prefix FE80::/64, as depicted in
   Figure 4.

   The tool for a 6LBR to obtain an IPv6 prefix for numbering the NFC
   network is can be accomplished via DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (RFC3633
   [8]).

4.4.  Neighbor Discovery

   Neighbor Discovery Optimization for 6LoWPANs (RFC6775 [4]) describes
   the neighbor discovery approach in several 6LoWPAN topologies, such
   as mesh topology.  NFC does not consider complicated mesh topology
   but simple multi-hop network topology or directly connected peer-to-
   peer network.  Therefore, the following aspects of RFC6775 are
   applicable to NFC:

   1.  In a case that a NFC-enabled device (6LN) is directly connected
       to 6LBR, A NFC 6LN MUST register its address with the 6LBR by
       sending a Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message with the Address
       Registration Option (ARO) and process the Neighbor Advertisement
       (NA) accordingly.  In addition, DHCPv6 is used to assigned an
       address, Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) is not required.

   2.  For sending Router Solicitations and processing Router
       Advertisements the NFC 6LNs MUST follow Sections 5.3 and 5.4 of
       the RFC6775.

4.5.  Header Compression

   Header compression as defined in RFC6282 [5] , which specifies the
   compression format for IPv6 datagrams on top of IEEE 802.15.4, is
   REQUIRED in this document as the basis for IPv6 header compression on
   top of NFC.  All headers MUST be compressed according to RFC6282
   encoding formats.

   If a 16-bit address is required as a short address of IEEE 802.15.4,
   it MUST be formed by padding the 6-bit NFC link-layer (node) address
   to the left with zeros as shown in Figure 5.

4.6.  Fragmentation and Reassembly

   Fragmentation and reassembly (FAR) as defined in RFC4944, which
   specifies the fragmentation methods for IPv6 datagrams on top of IEEE
   802.15.4, is REQUIRED in this document as the basis for IPv6 datagram
   FAR on top of NFC.  All headers MUST be compressed according to
   RFC4944 encoding formats, but the default MTU of NFC is 128 bytes.
   This MUST be considered.

4.7.  Unicast Address Mapping

   The address resolution procedure for mapping IPv6 non-multicast
   addresses into NFC link-layer addresses follows the general
   description in Section 7.2 of RFC4861 [9], unless otherwise
   specified.

   The Source/Target link-layer Address option has the following form
   when the addresses are 6-bit NFC link-layer (node) addresses.

                      0                   1

         This is the length of this option (including the type and
         length fields) in units of 8 octets.  The value of this field
         is 1 for 6-bit NFC node addresses.

      NFC address:

         The 6-bit address in canonical bit order.  This is the unicast
         address the interface currently responds to.

4.8.  Multicast Address Mapping

   All IPv6 multicast packets MUST be sent to NFC Destination Address,
   0x3F (broadcast) and filtered at the IPv6 layer.  When represented as
   a 16-bit address in a compressed header, it MUST be formed by padding
   on the left with a zero.  In addition, the NFC Destination Address,
   0x3F, MUST not be used as a unicast NFC address of SSAP or DSAP.

                      0                   1
                      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

5.  Internet Connectivity Scenarios

   As two typical scenarios, the NFC network can be isolated and
   connected to the Internet.

5.1.  NFC-enabled Device Connected to the Internet

   One of the key applications by using adaptation technology of IPv6
   over NFC is the most securely transmitting IPv6 packets because RF
   distance between 6LN and 6LBR SHOULD be within 10 cm.  If any third
   party wants to hack into the RF between them, it MUST come to nearly
   touch them.  Applications can choose which kinds of air interfaces
   (e.g., BT-LE, Wi-Fi, NFC, etc.) to send data depending
   characteristics of data.  NFC SHALL be the best solution for secured
   and private information.

   Figure 8 illustrates an example of NFC-enabled device network
   connected to the Internet.  Distance between 6LN and 6LBR SHOULD be
   10 cm or less.  If there is any of close laptop computers to a user,
   it SHALL becomes the 6LBR.  Additionally, When the user mounts a NFC-
   enabled air interface adapter (e.g., portable small NFC dongle) on

   the close laptop PC, the user's NFC-enabled device (6LN) can
   communicate the laptop PC (6LBR) within 10 cm distance.

          | <-------- NFC -------> | <----- IPv6 packet ------> |
          | (IPv6 over NFC packet) |                            |

      Figure 8: NFC-enabled device network connected to the Internet

5.2.  Isolated NFC-enabled Device Network

   In some scenarios, the NFC-enabled device network may transiently be
   a simple isolated network as shown in the Figure 9.

         6LN ---------------------- 6LR ---------------------- 6LN
          |     (10 cm or less)      |     (10 cm or less)      |
          |                          |                          |
          | <--------- NFC --------> | <--------- NFC --------> |
          |   (IPv6 over NFC packet) |  (IPv6 over NFC packet)  |

               Figure 9: Isolated NFC-enabled device network

   In mobile phone markets, applications are designed and made by user
   developers.  They may image interesting applications, where three or
   more mobile phones touch or attach each other to accomplish
   outstanding performance.  For instance, three or more mobile phones
   can play multi-channel sound of music together.  In addition,
   attached three or more mobile phones can make an extended banner to
   show longer sentences in a concert hall.

6.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations related to this document.

7.  Security Considerations

   The method of deriving Interface Identifiers from 6-bit NFC Link
   layer addresses is intended to preserve global uniqueness when it is
   possible.  Therefore, it is to required to protect from duplication
   through accident or forgery.
