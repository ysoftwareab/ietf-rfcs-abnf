Internet-Draft             Rehoming MCAST.NET                  July 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a maintenance policy and migration strategy
   for the MCAST.NET (MCAST.ARPA) domain that contains names for a
   subset of the multicast groups assigned by the IANA.

   Comments should be sent to the mboned working group.

1.1.  The ARPA top level domain

   [RFC3172] designates the ARPA top level domain as "Address and
   Routing Parameters Area" to be used for infrastructure applications.

   The MCAST.NET second level domain fulfills the criteria layed out in
   section 2.1 of [RFC3172].  However, there is no standards track
   document explicitly designating this domain to a multicast group name
   to multicast group address mapping.

   [RFC3171] defines the multicast address assignment policy.


2.  Current Use

   Currently the zone MCAST.NET reflects the contents of the IANA
   multicast address registry.  However, some names are missing from the
   DNS zone and some names used differ from the description that appears
   in the registry file.

   With few exceptions, only multicast group addresses from 224.0.0/24
   and 224.0.1/24 are listed in MCAST.NET.  Addresses outside 224/8 do
   not appear at all.


3.  Registration Policy

   Names within MCAST.ARPA will consist of one additional label and will
   adhere to the hostname syntax requirements of [RFC1123].  These names
   will own a single A RR, a single AAAA RR, or both.  Addresses will be
   in the IPv4 or IPv6 multicast address space.

3.1.  Names and Addresses eligible for Registration in MCAST.ARPA

   Only IANA multicast address registrations are eligible for being
   listed in MCAST.ARPA.

   For IPv4, only multicast groups from 224.0.0/24 (Local Network
   Control Block) and 224.0.1/24 (Internetwork Control Block) will have
   names assigned.

3.2.  Subdomains of MCAST.ARPA

   The namespace under MCAST.ARPA is considered flat, i.e., all direct
   descendants of MCAST.ARPA are leaves in the DNS tree.  Future
   extensions might want to define subdomains that serve special
   purposes.  Any such designation needs IETF consensus [RFC2434].

3.3.  Corresponding Reverse Mapping

   The DNS Reverse Mapping for those multicast groups that appear as
   addresses in MCAST.ARPA is to be kept consistent with the forward
   namespace.  A single DNS PTR record will be entered at the
   corresponding owner within the 224.IN-ADDR.ARPA domain that points to
   the multicast group name name within MCAST.ARPA.

   The zones 225.IN-ADDR.ARPA through 239.IN-ADDR.ARPA will be delegated
   but shall remain empty (except necessary infrastructure RRs).

   [How to deal with IPv6 multicast reverse mapping is TBD.]


4.  Migration Issues

   The current content of the MCAST.NET zone shall be brought in line
   with the multicast address registry.

   Since legacy systems may use MCAST.NET for quite some time, there
   needs to be a mapping/forwarding solution to answer those queries in
   a useful manner without discouraging migration.

   RFCs mentioning MCAST.NET are [RFC3261] and [RFC3678].

   An updated multicast address assignment policy appears in
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-addrarch].

4.1.  Migration Strategies

   After the move, several options are available for the future handling
   of MCAST.NET.

4.1.1.  Freeze

   The current MCAST.NET zone could be frozen, so that no additions,
   deletions or changes to the content (apart from those necessary for
   maintenance, e.g.  SOA and NS RRs) would be perfomed.  New
   registrations would only be available in MCAST.ARPA, so this could be
   an incentive for querying clients to alter their behavior as well.

4.1.2.  Phase Out

   MCAST.NET would only see deletions.

4.1.3.  Continue

   MCAST.NET could be further operated in parallel, either by
   operational habit or per DNAME RR.


5.  Security Considerations

   The usual Security Considerations for the DNS apply.

   There is no Security Problem associated with the migration itself.

   MCAST.ARPA. should be signed with DNSSEC as soon as the ARPA zone is
   signed.

   {This section needs more work.}


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document amends [RFC3171] to add a mandatory entry in the
   MCAST.ARPA domain and a corresponding reverse mapping entry.  The
   officially registered multicast group name is made subject to DNS
   hostname syntax rules.

   The author would like to thank David Conrad for his input.
