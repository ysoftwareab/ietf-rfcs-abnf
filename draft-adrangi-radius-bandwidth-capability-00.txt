      protocol framework within which the parameters can be exchanged 
      between an Access Network (AN) and a Home Service Network (HSN) 
      in order to determine the average minimum and maximum bandwidth 
      for both ingress and egress traffic that should be allocated by 
      the AN for the duration of an authorized client session.

   1. Introduction  
     
     The bandwidth that a user is authorized within an Access Network 
     (AN) can be a result of the AN bandwidth capabilities based on its 
     architecture and access technology, and the type of user 
     subscription to the home network (e.g., gold, silver, bronze user 
     types).   
      
     This document describes a simple protocol framework that enables 
     an Access Network (AN) to advertise its network bandwidth 
     capabilities that it can allocate for a given AN client connection 
     to the client∆s Home Service Network (HSN).  And, it also enables 
     the HSN to indicate its selection of the desired network bandwidth 
     capabilities for the client connection to the AN.   
      
     User bandwidth can be determined during initial authentication 
     authorization of the session.  It is also desirable to change the 
     bandwidth for the mid-session.  For example, the user may want to 
     purchase additional bandwidth to download a large file.  This 
     document enables operators to dynamically modify the bandwidth 
     allocation for a session.

     This document defines a new AAA attribute used for exchanging 
     network bandwidth parameters between the AN and the HSN, to 
     determine the average minimum and maximum bandwidth for both 
     ingress and egress traffic that an AN should allocate for the 
     duration of an authorized client session.  This attribute is also 
     used for reporting the allocated bandwidth in accounting records.  
     The attribute is described for RADIUS [1]. 
 
   1.2 Requirements language 
 
      In this document, several words are used to signify the 
      requirements of the specification.  These words are often 
      capitalized.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
      "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", 
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as 
      described in [RFC2119]. 
    
   1.3 Terminology 
 
      Access Network (AN) 
          The network that provides wired or wireless connectivity 
          to the Internet for clients (or stations) present in the 
          local access area. This MAY be in a separate security and 
          routing domain with respect to the Home Service Network or a 
          Mediating Network. 
       
      Home Service Network (HSN) 
          The network providing the service and therefore maintaining 
          the direct relationship to its users and subscribers. All AAA   
          functions are ultimately performed by the HSN. 
 
      RADIUS server 
         ÙThis is a server which provides for 
         authentication/authorization via the protocol described in 
         [1], and for accounting as described in [6].ˆ  It is deployed 
         in the PWLAN AN, MN, and HSN. 
 
   2. Overview  
    
     This section describes the bandwidth parameters and the protocol 
     by which these parameters are exchanged between an AN and a HSN.   
 
   2.1 Bandwidth Parameters 
    
      Bandwidth parameters describe the average minimum and maximum 
      data rates (for both ingress and egress traffic) for a client 
      connection within an AN.  There are four bandwidth parameters, 
      which are described in the following subsections. 
 
   2.1.1 Ingress Minimum Bandwidth 
 
  
   Adrangi, et al.          Expires Aug 30, 2004             [Page 3]
    
Internet Draft   Access Network Bandwidth Capability  8 Feb 2004 
                                   
               
 
        The ingress minimum bandwidth parameter indicates the average 
        minimum ingress data rate that an AN will try to provide to an 
        authorized user.  This value is a target, rather than a 
        guarantee.   
    
   2.1.2 Ingress Maximum Bandwidth 
    
        The ingress maximum bandwidth parameter indicates the average 
        maximum ingress data rate that an AN can allow to an authorized 
        user.   
    
   2.1.3 Egress Minimum Bandwidth 
    
        The minimum egress bandwidth parameter indicates the average 
        minimum egress data rate that an AN will try to provide to an 
        authorized user.  
        
   2.1.4 Egress Maximum Bandwidth 
    
        The maximum egress bandwidth parameter indicates the average 
        maximum data rate that an AN can allow to an authorized user.    
      
   2.2 Protocol 
    
      Two protocols are described.  One protocol is used to allocate 
      bandwidth when a service is initiated (referred to as Static 
      Bandwidth Allocation); the other protocol describes how to change 
      bandwidth attribute dynamically that is, mid session (referred to 
      as Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation). 
       
      Both protocols exchange bandwidth parameters using the various 
      RADIUS messages, and they are comprised of three phases:  
      bandwidth Advertisement, Selection, and Confirmation. 
       
      Bandwidth Advertisement: 
       
         MAY be sent in Access-Request packet from the AN to the HSN 
         and conveys possible/available bandwidth parameters that can 
         be allocated for an the AN client connection to the HSN by the 
         AN.  Advertisements are optional. 
       
      Bandwidth Selection:  
       
         MAY be sent in Access-Accept packet and Change of 
         Authorization (COA) messages.  Selection conveys the desired 
         bandwidth for the AN Client connection to the AN by the HSN.   
       
      Bandwidth Confirmation: 
       
         If Bandwidth Selection is received and enforced, It MUST be 
         sent in Accounting-Request packets.  Confirmation indicates

         that the desired bandwidth parameters specified by a HSN are 
         being enforced by the AN.   
       
       
      Bandwidth Attribute (BA), defined in section 3, is used to carry 
      the Bandwidth Advertisement, Selection, Confirmation in various 
      RADIUS packets. 
       
      An Advertisement, Selection, Confirmation is said to be valid if 
      it contains the four aforementioned bandwidth parameters and the 
      minimum bandwidth rate values for ingress and egress traffic MUST 
      be equal or less than their corresponding maximum bandwidth rate 
      values. 
       
      If a Selection is sent in response to an Advertisement, for the 
      Selection to be considered valid, then the bandwidth parameters 
      in the Selection MUST NOT exceed the corresponding bandwidth 
      parameters in the Advertisement. 
    
      The following subsections describe static and dynamic bandwidth 
      allocation. 
    
   2.2.1 Static Bandwidth Allocation 
    
        Static bandwidth allocation is preformed during the initial 
        session authentication / authorization. 
         
        The following diagram shows the protocol interaction between 
        the AN and the HSN for determining network bandwidth rates that 
        an AN needs to allocate for an AN client connection.

        The AN MAY send an Advertisement in an Access-Request message.  
        If the HSN receives an invalid Advertisement, then the HSN MUST 
        silently discard the Access-Request. 
       
        A HSN MAY send the Selection after receiving a valid 
        Advertisement.  It MAY also send the Selection in the absence 
        of an Advertisement, based on local policies such as the AN 
        client∆s subscription profile.  When the AN receives an invalid 
        Selection, it MUST treat the Access-Accept message as an Access 
        Reject. 
         
        If the AN receives a valid Selection in response to an Access-
        Request that did not contain an Advertisement, then the AN MAY 
        honor the Selection. 
         
        If the AN receives a valid Selection in response to an Access-
        Request that contained a valid Advertisement, then the AN MUST 
        honor the Selection. 
 
        In the absence of a Selection after sending a valid 
        Advertisement, in accordance with local policy, the AN MAY

        enforce its default bandwidth rate values or it MAY use Ùbest 
        effortˆ bandwidth for that client connection. 
    
   2.2.2 Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation 
    
        Dynamic bandwidth allocation uses the Change of Authorization 
        (COA) message as defined in [3].  In accordance with [3] there 
        are two methods for dynamically changing authorization 
        attributes of a session.  These two methods are described in 
        this section. 
         
        At anytime during the session the HSN may send the AN a COA 
        message containing session identification attributes (see [3] 
        for the possible options).  The COA message may include 
        authorization attributes in which case it is pushing the BAs to 
        the AN; or it may instruct the AN to generate an Authorize-Only 
        Access-Request (Access-Request with Service-Type set to 
        ÙAuthorize-Onlyˆ) in which case it is instructing the AN to 
        pull the BAs. 
         
        In either push or pull method, upon successful acceptance of 
        the new bandwidth parameters for the session.  The AN MUST 
        generate an Accouting-Stop record that contains the old 
        bandwidth attributes followed by an Accounting-Start message 
        that contains the new bandwidth attributes. 
         
        In order to allow for downstream correlation of the accounting 
        records, an AN that supports dynamic bandwidth allocation MUST 
        include Acct-Multi-Session-Id when writing accounting records.  
    
    
   2.2.2.1 Push Method 
    
          In the Push Method, to effect a dynamic bandwidth change the 
          HSN sends a COA message and includes a valid Selection.  The 
          AN MAY also include other attributes in the COA message.

          Upon the successful reception of the COA message (see [3] for 
          details) by the AN, if the COA message contains an invalid 
          Selection, the AN MUST respond with a COA NAK with Error 
          Cause (101) set to ÙInvalid Requestˆ (404). 
           
          If the AN is able to offer the requested bandwidth to the 
          specified session, the AN MUST reply with a COA-ACK and it 
          MUST generate an Accounting-Stop record containing the old 
          bandwidth attributes followed by an Accounting-Start record 
          containing the new bandwidth attributes.  If the AN can not 
          comply with the request for new bandwidth it MUST reply with 
          a COA-NAK with Error Cause (101) set to Ù"Resources 
          Unavailable"(506). 
    
   2.2.2.2 Pull Method 
    
          Alternatively, in the pull method, to effect a dynamic 
          bandwidth change, as per [3], the HSN sends a COA message to 
          instruct the AN to generate an Authorize-Only request 
          (Access-Request with Service-Type set to Authorize-Only).

          As with the static bandwidth allocation (described earlier), 
          the AN MAY Advertise the currently available bandwidth in the 
          Authorize-Only message. 
    
          Upon receiving the Authorize-Only message from the AN, the 
          HSN MUST respond with either an Access-Accept message or an 
          Access-Reject message. 
           
          When responding with an Access-Accept message, the HSN MAY 
          include the BAs for Selection.  If the Authorize-Only message 
          included an Advertisement, the bandwidth parameters in 
          Selection MUST be within the bounds of bandwidth parameters 
          in the Advertisement received in the Authorize-Only message. 
           
          Upon sending an Authorize-Only message, the AN will receive 
          an Access-Accept message or an Access-Reject message. 
           
          Upon receiving an Access-Reject in response to the Authorize-
          Only, the AN will terminate the session and send an 
          Accounting-Stop record. 
           
          Upon receiving an Access-Accept in response to an Authorize-
          Only request that does not contain bandwidth Selection, the 
          AN MUST resume utilizing the existing bandwidth parameters, 
          and it MUST NOT generate an Accounting Stop message.

          Upon receiving an Access-Accept packet that contains an 
          invalid Bandwidth Selection, the AN MUST treat the response 
          as an Access-Reject and immediately terminate the session. 
           
          Upon receiving an Access-Accept message in response to an 
          Authorize-Only message that contained the Bandwidth 
          Advertisement, then providing the bandwidth selections are 
          within the bounds of the Advertisement, then AN MUST honor 
          the requested bandwidth and generate an Accounting-Stop 
          message that contains the old bandwidth attributes followed 
          by an Account-Start message that contains the new bandwidth 
          attributes.  If the bandwidth Selection were outside the 
          bounds of the Advertisement, then the AN MUST treat the 
          Access-Accept as an Access-Reject and immediately terminate 
          the session. 
           
          Upon receiving an Access-Accept message that contains a valid 
          Selection in response to an Authorize-Only that did not 
          contain the Advertisement, the AN MAY honor the Selection or 
          it MAY continue to honor the previously agreed to bandwidth.  
          In the former case, the AN must generate an Accounting Stop 
          message containing the old bandwidth attributes followed by 
          an Accounting-Start message containing the current bandwidth 
          attributes.  
    
 
   3. Operations  
    
     Operation  is  identical  to  that  defined  in  RADIUS  AAA 
     specifications  [1][2]  and  Dynamic  Authorization  Extensions  to 
     Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)[3]. 
    
   4. Attribute Format/Syntax 
    
     This section describes format and syntax for the attribute that 
     carries AN bandwidth rate parameters. The attribute is used for 
     bandwidth rate parameters Advertisement, Selection, and 
     Confirmation. 
      
     The attribute MAY be present in Access-Request, Access-Accept, 
     Accounting-Request.
