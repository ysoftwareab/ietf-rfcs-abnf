Abstract   
   This memo documents an additional use cases based on the endpoint security
   posture assessment-enterprise use cases. From all use cases, we can 
   drive common functional capabilities and requirements to guide development 
   the standards for security posture assessment of the telecommunication
   and enterprise equipment.

1. Introduction
   SACM will create an automated tool for security assessment about network 
   devices in enterprise scenario. In the other scenario, telecommunication
   operator has pleanty of network devices which need to be assessed
   authomatically. According to the telecommunication operator's operation
   experience, it proposes new security use cases to cover telecommunication
   devices. These use cases can also apply the enterprise's enquipment.
     
2. Conventions used in this document
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 
         
   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation 
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

3. Problem Statement
3.1 Backgroud of telecommunication device use cases

Internet-Draft     Telecommunication Requirement                Feb 2014
   
   Due to the large number of telecommunications equipment, it will bring
   a lot of work to manually check compliance of the equipment during the
   operation and maintenance phase, what's more, negligent operation and
   maintenance personnel may lead to wrong configuration, causing some bad
   consequences, such as device system paralysis, abnormal operation of the
   network and so on. Therefore, implementation of telecommunication
   equipments also needs an automated tool.
   
3.2 problem statment
   Although the use cases of SACM are only for enterprise in the endpoint,
   but the vast majority of them can be applied in the scenario of
   telecommunications network. There are following problems for the secure
   assessment of telecommunications network equipment:
   1. Lack of security posture assessment baseline setting. That is, it is
   necessary to set an acceptable security policy or security posture
   assessment baseline before collecting, assessing security posture, also
   it is necessary to assess the integrity and feasibility.
   2. Lack of process after that equipment security policy does not meet
   the security posture , and it needs remediation and triggering the new
   assessment.

4 New use cases for telecommunication equipment
4.1 security policy baseline setting
   This use case describes the process of setting security policy baseline
   of the telecommunication equipment. This use case can be initiated by a
   variety of triggers including:
   
   1. The initial deployment of the telecommunication equipment in the
   operator's network.
   2. A network event (e.g. network architecture evolution).
   
   The building blocks of this use case are:
   Security policy baseline input: when manufacturers are selling
   equipments, they will provide a baseline of security in order to help
   operators to understand the security status of the device, and also
   providing security operational guidance equipment to indicate how to
   configure the device security posture. The industry has some relevant
   standards.
    o General Security policy baseline setting: based on security policy

Internet-Draft     Telecommunication Requirement                Feb 2014

      baseline input and their own business experience, operators set a
      common security policy baseline, including the administrator's
      password length, the effective time and so on.
    o Specific security policy baseline setting: Operators set security
      policy baseline for devices according to the specific features and
      deployment environment.

4.2 Security posture remediation
   This use case describes the process of remedying security posture when
   the posture evaluation result of has not complied with the operator's
   security policy.    The building blocks of this use case are:
   Unmatched security posture identification: The purpose of unmatched
   security posture identification is to determine the target to be posture
   remedied.
   Security posture remediation: The maintenance stuff of the operator
   process the unmatched security posture. After remediation, the new
   assessment process can be triggered manually or automatically.

5. Security Considerations
   TBD
