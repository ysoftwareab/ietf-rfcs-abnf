        Key Exchange Without Forward Secrecy is Not Recommended
              draft-mattsson-tls-psk-ke-dont-dont-dont-00

Abstract

   Key exchange without forward secrecy enables passive monitoring
   [RFC7258].  Massive pervasive monitoring attacks relying on key
   exchange without forward secrecy has been reported
   [I-D.ietf-emu-aka-pfs].  If key exchange without Diffe-Hellan is
   used, compromise of the long-term authenticatation key enables a
   passive attacker to compromise past and future sessions.  All TLS 1.2
   cipher suites without forward secrecy has been marked as NOT
   RECOMMENDED [RFC8447], and static RSA has been forbidden in TLS 1.3
   [RFC8446]. psk_ke does not provide forward secrecy and is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  This document sets the IANA registration of psk_ke to
   NOT RECOMMENDED.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to update the PskKeyExchangeMode registry under the
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) Parameters heading.  For psk_ke the
   "Recommended" value has been set to "N".
