                   PASSporT SHAKEN Extension (SHAKEN)
                   draft-ietf-stir-passport-shaken-00

Abstract

   This document extends PASSporT, which is a token object that conveys
   cryptographically-signed information about the participants involved
   in communications, to include information defined as part of the
   SHAKEN specification from ATIS (Alliance for Telecommunications
   Industry Solutions) and the SIP Forum IP-NNI Joint Task Force.  These
   extensions provide a level of confidence in the correctness of the
   originating identity for a telephone network that has communications
   coming from both STIR participating originating communications as
   well as communications that does not include STIR information.

1.  Introduction

   The SHAKEN [ATIS-1000074] specification defines a framework for using
   STIR protocols including PASSporT [I-D.ietf-stir-passport],
   RFC4474bis [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis] and the STIR certificate
   framework [I-D.ietf-stir-certificates] for implementing the
   cryptographic validation of an authorized originator of telephone
   calls using SIP.  Because the current telephone network contains both
   VoIP and TDM/SS7 originated traffic, there are many scenarios that
   need to be accounted for where PASSporT signatures may represent
   either direct or indirect call origination scenarios.  The SHAKEN
   [ATIS-1000074] specification defines levels of attestation of the
   origination of the call as well as an origination identifier that can
   help create a unique association with the origination of calls from
   various parts of the VoIP or TDM telephone network.  This document
   specifies these indicators as a specified PASSporT extension.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Overview of 'shaken' PASSporT extension

   The SHAKEN framework is designed to use PASSporT
   [I-D.ietf-stir-passport] as a method of asserting the telephone
   number calling identity.  In addition to the PASSporT base claims,
   there are two additional claims that have been defined for the needs
   of a service provider to signal information beyond just the telephone
   identity.  First, in order to help bridge the transition of the state
   of the current telephone network which has calls with no
   authentication and non-SIP [RFC3261] signaling not compatible with
   the use of PASSporT and Secure Telephone Identity (STI) in general,
   there is an attestation claim.  This provides three levels of
   attestation, including a full attestation when the service provider
   can fully attest to the calling identity, a partial attestation, when
   the service provider originated a telephone call but can not fully
   attest to the calling identity, and a gateway attestation which is
   the lowest level of attestation and represents the service provider
   receiving a call from a non PASSporT or STI supporting telephone
   gateway.

   The second claim is a unique origination identifier that should be
   used by the service provider to identify different sources of
   telephone calls to support a traceback mechanism that can be used for
   enforcement and identification of a source of illegitimate calls.

   The next two sections define these new claims.

4.  PASSporT 'attest' Claim

   This indicator allows for both identifying the service provider that
   is vouching for the call as well as clearly indicating what
   information the service provider is attesting to.  The 'attest' claim
   can be one of the following three values, 'A', 'B', or 'C' as defined
   in [ATIS-1000074].

   'A' represents 'Full Attestation' where the signing provider MUST
   satisfy all of the following conditions:

   o  Is responsible for the origination of the call onto the IP based
      service provider voice network.

   o  Has a direct authenticated relationship with the customer and can
      identify the customer.

   o  Has established a verified association with the telephone number
      used for the call.

   'B' represents 'Partial Attestation' where the signing provider MUST
   satisfy all of the following conditions:

   o  Is responsible for the origination of the call onto its IP-based
      voice network.

   o  Has a direct authenticated relationship with the customer and can
      identify the customer.

   o  Has NOT established a verified association with the telephone
      number being used for the call.

   'C' represents 'Gateway Attestation' where the signing provider MUST
   satisfy all of the following conditions:

   o  Is the entry point of the call into its VoIP network.

   o  Has no relationship with the initiator of the call (e.g.,
      international gateways)

5.  PASSporT 'origid' Claim

   The purpose of the unique origination identifier is to assign an
   opaque identifier corresponding to the service provider-initiated
   calls themselves, customers, classes of devices, or other groupings
   that a service provider might want to use for determining things like
   reputation or trace back identification of customers or gateways.
   The value of 'origid' claim is a UUID as defined in [RFC4122].
   SHAKEN isn't prescriptive in the exact usage of origid other than the
   UUID format as a globally unique identifier representing the
   originator of the call to whatever granularity the PASSporT signer
   determines is sufficient for the ability to trace the original
   origination point of the call.  There will likely be best practices
   documents that more precisely guide it's usage in real deployments.

7.  Using 'shaken' in SIP

   The use of the 'shaken' PASSporT type and the claims 'attest' and
   'origid' are formally defined in [ATIS-1000074] for usage in SIP
   [RFC3261] aligned with the use of the identity header defined in
   [I-D.ietf-stir-rfc4474bis].  The carriage of the 'attest' and
   'origid' values are in the full PASSporT token included in the
   identity header as specified in [ATIS-1000074].

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  JSON Web Token claims

   This specification requests that the IANA add two new claims to the
   JSON Web Token Claims registry as defined in [RFC7519].

   Claim Name: "attest"

   Claim Description: Attestation level as defined in SHAKEN framework

   Change Controller: IESG

   Specification Document(s): [RFCThis]

   Claim Name: "origid"

   Claim Description: Originating Identifier as defined in SHAKEN
   framework

   Change Controller: IESG

   Specification Document(s): [RFCThis]
