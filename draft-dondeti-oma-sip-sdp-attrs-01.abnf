a=bcastversion:<major>.<minor>

      This field specifies the OMA BCAST version "bcastversion" Value in
      the format x.y.  The Value field is of XML data type Decimal.

      This is a session-level attribute and is not dependent on charset.
a=keystreamtype:<Type of Keystream>

      This field specifies the type of keystream as a string.  The valid
      values are "stkm" and "ltkm" for short and long term key messages.

      This is a session or a media-level attribute and is not dependent
      on charset.

a=stkmstream:<id of the stkm stream>

      The stkmstream attribute specifies mapping Short Term Key Message
      (STKM) streams to media streams in the SDP.

      The attribute can be at session level, in which case it applies to
      all media streams, or it can be at media level, in which case it
      only applies to the specified media and would overwrite possible
      session level attribute.

      Each session or media stream can have multiple stkmstream
      attributes.  Using this attribute, the terminal can lookup the
      corresponding STKM stream announcements and figure out which one
      to listen to and process.  We note that this attribute is optional
      and hence would not be there for unencrypted media streams.

      This field is not dependent on charset.

a=encryptedstreamid:<id of the stkm stream>

      This field refers to the encrypted stream id and takes a non-zero
      positive integer.  This is a session or a media-level attribute
      and is not dependent on charset.

a=SRTPAuthentication:<id for SRTP authentication algorithm value>

      When SRTP is used, the attribute SRTPAuthentication states which
      authentication algorithm to use.  Based on RFC4771, the identifier
      is a transform-independent parameter of the cryptographic context
      for SRTP in integer format.

      One of the following three integrity transforms registered for the
      three modes MUST be used: value "2" for RCCm1, "3" for RCCm2 and
      "4" for RCCm3.

a=SRTPROCTxRate:<ROC transmission rate>

      When SRTP is used, the attribute SRTPROCTxRate is used to define
      the ROC transmission rate, R, which is given in network byte
      order.
      R MUST be a non-zero unsigned integer between 1 and 65535
      inclusive, as specified in [RFC4771].  If the ROC transmission
      rate is not included in the negotiation, the default value of 1
      SHALL be used.
