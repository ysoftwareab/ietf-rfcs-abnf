Abstract

   This document outlines the issues facing nomadic communications in
   an IP-based environment. While cellular systems epitomise current
   concepts of mobility, there is an industry need to support similar
   functions in non-cellular environments as well. Unfortunately,
   solutions defined to-date by the cellular industry tend to be
   closely tied to the technology employed over the radio link (e.g.
   GSM, cdma2000, UMTS, EDGE).

   To facilitate discussion, this document begins with a high-level
   description of functional entities comprising an Open IP Network
   Infrastructure. It then defines an abstract model of the access link
   used to connect a mobile host to the network. Using these entities
   and model, we then go on to discuss the issues facing nomadic
   computing that could be usefully addressed by an IETF working group
   like CRAPS.

1. Introduction

   This document establishes a framework for addressing issues related
   to nomadic communications -- the ability to send and receive
   information from wherever you are currently located -- in an IP-
   based environment. While public cellular systems epitomise current
   concepts of mobility, there is an industry need to support similar
   functions in non-cellular, non-voice environments as well.

   The power of the Internet Protocol suite is its independence from
   underlying link technologies. Solutions defined using protocols at
   and above the IP layer can operate over and across any link
   technology -- assuming that inherent characteristics of a link
   technology have not been consciously or unconsciously incorporated
   into the "IP" solution. Unfortunately, solutions defined to-date by
   the cellular industry tend to be closely tied to the technology
   employed over the radio link (e.g. GSM, cdma2000, UMTS, EDGE); even
   when the radio link technology is similar (e.g. CDMA as the basis
   for cdma2000 and UMTS), different standards bodies have chosen
   different solutions that attempt to exploit the uniqueness of their
   radio link solution.

   The goal of OPINIONS is to define a set of protocols that can
   achieve similar levels of mobility using IP-based protocols inside
   the access network that are independent of the underlying link
   technology. Furthermore, OPINIONS should be based, wherever
   possible, on existing protocols and frameworks that have significant
   support of, and penetration into, the Internet community in order to
   speed introduction of mobility support. We recognise, however, that
   many IETF protocols have not been developed with mobility in mind.
   This document therefore contains an initial list of problem areas
   that could be addressed by a (new) IETF working group.

3. Functional Model for IP-based Access Network

   To facilitate later discussion of issues, we introduce a functional
   model of an IP-based access network. In this document, "access
   network" is the autonomous system providing the link that connects
   the mobile host (MH) to the rest of the network (Figure 1).


   MH <--> [Access Network] <--> [Internet] <--> [Service Provider]
                                            <--> [Content Provider]

                                 Figure 1


   In this model, the Service Provider is an entity that "owns" the
   subscriber and is generally responsible for subscriber accounts and
   customer care. The Service Provider is also responsible (for
   providing data) for authenticating the subscriber and for
   authorising use of services and resources according to the
   conditions of the subscription. An End User (EU) may subscribe to
   more than one Service Provider. The Content Provider supplies
   information and/or applications for use by the EU; a Service
   Provider may also be a Content Provider.

   The Access Network (Figure 2) includes a (set of) access link(s)
   which connects the MH at one end to an access port (AP) at the other
   end. Any Layer 1 and 2 technology can be used over this (set of)
   link(s) -- dial-up, DSL, cable, point-to-point radio, Ethernet,
   cellular radio, etc. The AP may be a simple pass-through device
   (e.g. an Ethernet hub) or a complex subnet in its own right (e.g. a
   cable headend with a hybrid fibre-coax distribution network, a
   cellular base station controller with a number of subtending base
   stations).


   MH <-link-> AP <-> MNAS <->[routed cloud]<-> MABG <->[Internet]

      |--------- access provider domain -----------|

                                 Figure 2


   The Access Port is connected to one Mobile Network Access Server
   (MNAS). As defined in [NAS], in the uplink direction the MNAS:

     -  is the point at which users are authenticated, access policy is
        enforced, network services are authorised, network usage is
        audited, and resource consumption is tracked.

     -  is the first place in a network where security measures and
        policy may be implemented.

Internet Draft      Open IP Network Infrastructure             July 2000
                         for Nomadic Services

     -  is the first place to apply Quality of Service (QoS) policies
        to the packets.

   Each MNAS can communicate with one or more Mobile Access Border 
   Gateways (MABG). The MABG:

     -  advertises to the rest of the Internet reachability for (a
        subset of) IP network addresses assigned to the access network.
        In a wide area deployment, several MABGs may advertise
        reachability to the same (subset of) network addresses.

     -  filters (discards) packets passing between the access network
        and the rest of the Internet according to access policies.

     -  directs packets in the downlink direction towards the serving
        or anchor MNAS, according to interior (mobility) routing
        protocols.

   In the uplink direction (Figure 3), packets are routed from a MNAS
   to a MABG according to routing policies in effect at the MNAS. For
   example, using standard routing protocols, each packet will exit the
   Access Network via the MABG advertising the shortest/best route to
   the packet's destination IP address.

                         for Nomadic Services

   In the downlink direction, packets enter the Access Network via the
   MABG advertising the shortest/best route to the destination MH
   address, from the perspective of the source node. The packets must
   then be routed from the ingress MABG to the MNAS that is currently
   serving (or anchoring) the MH.

   Note that a single network element may operate both as a MABG and as
   a MNAS.

   Following initial access authentication and authorisation, a MH may
   freely move from one access link to another, regardless of the MNAS
   serving that link. As the MH roams, the redirection of packets to
   and from the MH, the enforcement of policies, the execution of
   security measures and the maintenance of QoS guarantees is handled
   through interaction between the various networks elements (MH, MNAS,
   MABG, PMS, etc.) in a manner that is transparent to the EU. In other
   words, it should not be necessary for the EU to take explicit action
   (such as re-starting a session) to realise seamless mobility across
   various access links.

   The act of switching between access links often requires support
   from Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the access link in order to be seamless.
   These actions occur in real-time, as the MH is moving. In a cellular
   context, this is often referred to as handover (or handoff). Due to
   the close coupling with access link technologies, handover
   algorithms and techniques are outside the scope of OPINIONS.

   Before, during or after handover -- depending on the access link
   technology and on the degree of packet loss or delay that can be
   tolerated -- the flow of packets to and from the MH may have to be
   adjusted to take into account the change in access link(s) used by
   the MH. We refer to this as relocating the MH and redirecting flows.
   In general, the real-time requirements of relocation are not as
   stringent as those of handover.

   Note:
        The MNAS may be decomposed even further into a Mobile Network
        Control Point (MNCP) and a Mobile Network Anchor Point (MNAP).
        At the edge of the access network, the MNCP terminates
        signalling to/from the MH while the MNAP terminates bearer
        traffic to/from the MH. This separation into distinct
        functional entities allows decisions involving transfer of
        control (i.e. between MNCPs) to be divorced from decisions
        involving transfer of connectivity (i.e. between MNAPs). The
        need for separation into MNCP and MNAP is for further study.

4. Abstract Model of the Access Link and Port

   The Access Port supports one or more access links on the set of
   interfaces facing the MH and one or more links on another set of
   interfaces facing the MNAS (Figure 4).

   IP datagrams are carried over the access link(s) between the MH and
   the AP; the underlying link technology is beyond the scope of
   OPINIONS. IP datagrams are also carried between the MNAS and the AP
   over network links where, once again, the underlying link technology
   is beyond the scope of OPINIONS. Barring undetected errors
   introduced by these links, the IP datagram transmitted by a MH is
   the same IP datagram that is received by the MNAS, and vice versa.
   In other words, the link technology used to convey the packets over
   the access link is transparent to the MNAS, just as the link
   technology used over the network link is transparent to the MH.

5. Relocation scenarios

   If a MH switches from using one (set of) access link(s) connected to
   an AP to using a different (set of) access link(s) connected to the
   same AP, this switch is transparent to the MNAS. For example, a MH
   may transparently move from one Ethernet link to another link
   connected to the same Ethernet hub. Similarly, a MH may be handed
   over from one (sector of a) cellular base station to another (sector
   of a) cellular base station connected to the same base station
   controller.

   However, if a MH switches between access links connected to
   different APs, then the MNAS must be involved to co-ordinate the
   redirection of IP flows from one AP to another. Similarly, if the MH
   switches between access links connected to different APs that are
   connected to different MNASes, then the MNASes (and, perhaps, the
   MABGs) must be involved to co-ordinate the redirection of IP flows.

   Therefore, the three major relocation scenarios are:

   a) MH to access link connected to same AP.

   b) MH to access link connected to different AP connected to same
      MNAS.

   c) MH to access link connected to different AP connected to
      different MNASes.

   Scenario (a) is handled entirely within the domain of the access
   links and does not affect OPINIONS. Scenario (b) requires
   interaction between the MNAS and the affected APs and, possibly, a
   transfer of link-specific information between APs (via the MNAS).
   Scenario (c) requires interaction between the affected MNAS and
   between the MNAS and the MABG.

6. Issues in IP-Based Nomadic Computing

   In general, an MNAS must conform to the same framework as that
   defined for a non-mobile aware NAS [NAS]. Additional issues
   introduced by the nomadic nature of the MHs include:


6.1 Flow Redirection

   In an Access Network of 'N' MNAS and 'M' MABG, a MH communicating
   through one MNAS may have simultaneous flows that transit more than
   one MABG. When the MH moves to the domain of a different MNAS,
   downlink packets must be redirected from all MABG (with active flows
   for the MH) to the new serving MNAS. In addition, the new serving
   MNAS may have routing policies that cause it to forward uplink
   packets to a different (set of) MABG than the previous MNAS.

     -  What is the (mobile-specific) interior routing protocol used to
        effect the redirection of downlink flows?
     -  Are there any special considerations or restrictions for
        redirecting uplink flows (e.g. ingress filtering)?
     -  Is there an anchor point for all flows? If so, where is it?
     -  How are flows between MHs in the same Access Network routed
        (e.g. directly between MNAS or via a MABG)?

6.2 MH Relocation Signalling

   As a MH moves from the domain of one AP to the domain of another, an
   IP-based message must be used to trigger a reaction inside the
   Access Network.

     -  Who generates this message (e.g. the MH or the AP)?
     -  Who is this message sent to (e.g. serving MNAS, target MNAS,
        anchor signalling control point)?

6.3 Downlink Macro Diversity

   Downlink macro diversity refers to the delivery of a given packet to
   several APs simultaneously. Such capability can be beneficial even
   if macro diversity is not explicitly supported over the access
   links.

     -  How are legs of the downlink diversity tree added and deleted?
     -  How is delivery of packets to multiple APs synchronised?
     -  How is the ordering and sequencing of packets to multiple APs
        controlled in a lossy network?

6.4 Uplink Macro Diversity

   Uplink macro diversity refers to the reception of a given packet
   from several APs simultaneously.


Gage, Kenward            Expires January 2001                   [Page 8]
Internet Draft      Open IP Network Infrastructure             July 2000
                         for Nomadic Services

     -  How are legs of the uplink diversity tree added and deleted?
     -  How are replicated packets identified?
     -  How are duplicated packets filtered (discarded)?

6.5 Relocating Quality of Service

   A MH may generate traffic requiring something other than best effort
   service. Such flows are usually subject to admission control and may
   require the reservation of network resources. As the MH moves
   between access links:

     -  How are resource requirements communicated between network
        elements?
     -  How is admission control performed on relocation?
     -  How is QoS maintained during and after relocation?
     -  What happens if the required QoS cannot be maintained?

6.6 Accounting

   In a fixed network, the NAS is responsible for generating accounting
   records at the start and at the end of a "session" and, optionally,
   at periodic intervals throughout the "session".

     -  What is a "session" in the connectionless environment of
        OPINIONS?
     -  What marks the start and end of a "session"?
     -  Which entity (or entities) generates accounting records and
        when?



7. Security Considerations


7.1 (Initial) Authentication and Authorisation

   When a MH initially enters or powers on inside an Access Network,
   the EU (and maybe the MH device itself) must be authenticated and
   authorised for services within the Access Network.

     -  How are AA packets exchanged if the MH is relocated in the
        middle of the AA process (i.e. before a routable IP address is
        assigned)?
     -  How are the results of authentication and authorisation
        communicated to other network elements?

7.2 Ongoing Authentication and Authorisation

   As the MH roams through the Access Network, security measures are
   required to ensure that the entity using an IP address is, in fact,
   the same EU (and MH device) that was originally authenticated. In
   addition, services authorised for use in one area of an Access

                         for Nomadic Services

   Network may not be authorised, or may have different operating
   parameters, in other areas of the Access Network.

     -  How is the EU/MH authenticated on an ongoing basis to prevent
        hijacking of IP addresses?
     -  How is use of network resources validated on an ongoing basis
        to ensure conformance to policies and to prevent accounting
        repudiation?
     -  What is the architecture and protocols of the (COPS) Policy
        Management System to support services in a mobile environment?
     -  What is the architecture and protocols of the (SIP) Session
        Management System to support services in a mobile environment?

7.3 Virtual Private Networks

   Virtual Private Networking requires enforcement of routing policies,
   service profiles and/or IP address allocation that are dictated by
   an entity outside the domain of the Access Network.

     -  How are the VPN requirements reflected in the architecture and
        protocols of the Access Network?
