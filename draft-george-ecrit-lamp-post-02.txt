   Civic Location Format Extension for Utility and Lamp Post Numbers
                    draft-george-ecrit-lamp-post-02

Abstract

   This document describes an extension to civic location format and
   adds two new CAtypes: PN (pole number) and MP (milepost).  Pole
   Numbers are used on poles such as lamp posts or utility poles, and
   can be used in some circumstances as location information.  Mileposts
   are numeric values measured from an end of a trail, road, railway
   line or other feature.

Internet-Draft       Civic Location Format Extension          March 2010


1.  Introduction

   In some areas, utility and lamp posts carry a unique identifier,
   which we call a pole number in this document.  In some countries, the
   label on the lamp post also carries the local emergency service
   number, such as "110", encouraging callers to use the pole number to
   identify their location.

                Lamp post with emergency number.

   On some roads, and many trails, railroad rights of way and other
   linear features, a post with a mile or kilometer distance from one
   end of the feature may be found (a "milepost").  There are other
   cases of poles or markers with numeric indications that are not the
   same as a "house number" or street address number.

   In this document, we define an extension of the civic address format
   defined in [RFC4119] updated by [RFC5139] to carry such pole number
   and milepost information.


2.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

Internet-Draft       Civic Location Format Extension          March 2010


   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Pole Number and Milepost

   [RFC4776] and [RFC5139] provides a full set of parameters that may be
   used to describe a civic location.

   This document describes two new CAtypes, PN (pole number), which is
   used to support post numbers, and MP (milepost), which is used to
   support mileposts.  The pole number can consist of any combination of
   letters and digits.  Punctuation characters and embedded spaces are
   ignored; lower and upper case letters are treated as equivalent.
   Mileposts are traditionally mile or kilometer distances from one end
   of the feature, but the field may contain any combination of letters,
   digits and punctuation characters.  There could be country specific
   considerations for PN or MP use, but none are described in this
   document.


   +---------+--------+-------------------------------+--------------+
   | CAtype  | PIDF   | Description                   | Example      |
   +---------+--------+-------------------------------+--------------+
   | 43      |   PN   | lamp post number              | A12101S      |
   +---------+--------+-------------------------------+--------------+
   | 44      |   MP   | Milepost                      | 102.4        |
   +---------+--------+-------------------------------+--------------+
