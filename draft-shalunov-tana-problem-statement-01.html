<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>The IETF P2PI workshop conducted in the end of May 2008 at MIT in Boston has identified a number of potential documents for the IETF to work on.
</p>
<p>One is a transport protocol with congestion control mechanism that enables an advanced networking application to minimize the extra delay it induces in the bottleneck while implementing an end-to-end version of scavenger service.  At least one such protocol has now been implemented by a major peer-to-peer application and deployed in the wild with favorable results.
</p>
<p>Another is a document that addresses community concerns about the use of multiple transport connections by peer-to-peer applications, both when these connections run to the same peer and to different peers.
</p>
<p>These two items appear to fall within the Transport area, but not within the charter of any existing working group.  It is not obvious what WG's charter could be naturally extended to encompass these two items.  The TANA BoF is held to explore the problem space, gauge the interest in the problems within the Transport area, and to see if the community and the area directors believe that it makes sense to form a TANA working group within the Transport area  chartered to work on
		</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>standardizing end-to-end congestion control that enables advanced application to minimize the delay they introduce into the network and a protocol using it and

Congestion control that minimizes delay and a UDP-based protocol using it</h3>

<p>The standard congestion control in TCP is based on loss and has not been designed to drive delay to any given value.  Because TCP needs losses to back off, when a FIFO bottleneck lacks AQM, TCP fills the buffer, effectively maximizing possible delay.  Large number of the thinnest links in the Internet, particularly most uplinks of home connections, lack AQM.  They also frequently contain enough buffer space to get delays into hundreds of milliseconds and even seconds.  There is no benefit to having delays this large, but there are very substantial drawbacks for interactive applications: games and VoIP become impossible and even web browsing becomes very slow.
</p>
<p>While a number of delay-based congestion control mechanisms have been proposed, they were generally not designed to minimize the delay induced in the network.
</p>
<p>It is desirable to have a congestion control mechanism that would allow to keep the latency across the congested bottleneck low even as it is saturated.  This would allow applications that send large amounts of data, particularly upstream on home connections, such as peer-to-peer application, to operate without destroying the experience in interactive applications.  It is possible to design congestion control mechanisms that take advantage of delay measurements and can back off before loss occurs.  One such mechanism has been deployed by BitTorrent in the wild with the BitTorrent DNA client.  This mechanism not only allows to keep delay across a bottleneck low, but also yields quickly in the presence of competing traffic with loss-based congestion control.
</p>
<p>Standardization of a congestion control mechanism that meets these design objectives would enable other advanced networking applications to better get out of the way of interactive apps.
</p>
<p>To deploy a protocol using such congestion control in today's Internet, the protocol needs to be designed to work with existing deployed NATs, firewalls, and other middleboxes.  This limits the choices of the transport framing to TCP and UDP.  Modifying TCP is out of scope for TANA, because it is a more ambitious project while advanced applications can use a special protocol to talk among instances of themselves.  This leaves us with UDP as the underlying framing for the protocol.
</p>
<p>In addition to direct and immediate benefits for advanced application, such congestion control would lay the foundation for a possible future evolution of the Internet where loss is not part of the designed behavior and delay is minimized.

<a name="rfc.section.3"></a><h3>3.&nbsp;
Use of multiple transport connections by peer-to-peer applications</h3>

<p>The community is concerned about the possible use of multiple transport connections by peer-to-peer clients, particularly if the goal of such use is to circumvent fairness mechanisms in TCP.
</p>
<p>Peer-to-peer clients are designed to open connections to multiple other peers to organize a well-connected mesh.  For example, with just a single connection per peer, peers would pair off and be quickly out of trading material; with two connections, peers would form long chains that still promote segmentation and are fragile.  There is confusion about whether peer-to-peer applications are also designed to open multiple connections to the same peer to get an unfair share of bottleneck capacity.  (I am personally not familiar with examples of P2P clients that are designed to open multiple connections to the same destination, for any purpose.)
</p>
<p>While the use of multiple transport connections, even to the same destination, has been common since the advent of the web browser, peer-to-peer applications are believed by some to open an unusually large number of connections and send data for particularly long periods of time.
</p>
<p>The most common P2P protocol, BitTorrent, uses a mechanism called "choking" to limit the number of connections that actually send and receive data.  Many more connections are open that used for data.  Most connections are only used for small pieces of metadata.  This further complicates the analysis and can create the impression that the peer uses many more connections than it actually does.
</p>
<p>Both the IETF transport community and the designers of P2P apps would benefit from clarity produced by a document that would
				</p>
<ol class="text">
<li>describe the current practice of multiple connections use by peer-to-peer apps and
</li>
<li>make recommendations about the best such practices.
</li>
