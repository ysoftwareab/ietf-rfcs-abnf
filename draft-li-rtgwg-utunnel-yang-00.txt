1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] is a data definition language that was introduced to
   define the contents of a conceptual data store that allows networked
   devices to be managed using NETCONF[RFC6241].  YANG is proving
   relevant beyond its initial confines, as bindings to other
   interfaces(e.g.  ReST) and encoding other than XML (e.g.  JSON) are
   being defined.  Furthermore, YANG data models can be used as the
   basis of implementation for other interface, such as CLI and
   Programmatic APIs.

   At present, multiple types of tunnels can be provided to carry vpn
   services, such as LDP LSPs, RSVP-TE tunnel, GRE tunnel.  All of the
   tunnels can be managed unifiedly to support vpn services according to
   tunnel policy.  Different types of tunnels can be managed unifiedly
   to form tunnel-group to support services.

   This document defines a YANG data model for the unified tunnel.  The
   data model covers the operational state of tunnels.

2.  2.  UTunnel Data Model Organization

2.1.  Overview

   The information of unified tunnel is about the generic operational
   state of different types of tunnels.  These core data is necessary
   for vpn service to select the carrying tunnel.  The tunnels include
   p2p, mp2p and p2mp tunnel.  P2p and mp2p tunnel use the same
   container with the name p2ptunnels.  P2mp tunnel is not included in
   this version and will be defined later.

   Some tunnels like ldp can be from specific vrf or default vrf.  And
   some tunnels like rsvp-te are only from the default vrf.  So the vrf-
   name is as key attribute of the tunnel.

   The tunnel destination can be ipv4 or ipv6 address.  It depends on
   implementation of the tunnel protocol.

   The figure below describes the overall structure of the utunnel yang
   model :

   module: utunnel
      +--ro utunnel
         +--ro p2ptunnels
            +--ro tunnel* [vrf-name tunnel-protocol tunnel-id]

               +--ro tunnel-id          tunnel-id
               +--ro tunnel-name?       tunnel-name
               +--ro oper-status?       tunnel-status
               +--ro address-family
                  +--ro ipv4
                  |  +--ro destination?   inet:ipv4-address
                  +--ro ipv6

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following URIs in the IETF XML registry
   [RFC3688].  Following the format in [RFC3688], the following
   registration is requested to be made.

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-utunnel XML: N/A, the requested
   URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].

   name: ietf-utunnel namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-
   utunnel prefix: utunnel.

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol[RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model
   [RFC6536] provides means to restrict access for particular NETCONF
   users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF protocol
   operations and content.  There are a number of data nodes defined in
   the YANG module which are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config
   true, which is the default).  These data nodes may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write

   operations (e.g., <edit-config>) to these data nodes without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
