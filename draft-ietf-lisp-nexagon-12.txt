1.  Introduction

  The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis]
  splits IP addresses in two different namespaces, Endpoint Identifiers
  (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs). LISP uses map-and-encap approach
  (1) a Mapping System (distributed database) that stores and resolves
  EID-RLOC mappings and on (2) LISP tunnel routers (xTRs) encapsulating
   and decapsulating data packets based on content of those mappings.

  H3 (https://h3geo.org)is a geospatial indexing system using hexagonal
  grid that can be subdivided into finer and finer hexagonal grids,
  combining the benefits of a hexagonal grid with hierarchy.
  H3 supports sixteen resolutions. Each finer resolution has cells with
  1/7 the area of the coarser resolution. Hexagons cannot be perfectly
  subdivided into seven hexagons, so the finer cells are approximately
  contained within a parent cell. Each cell is identified by 64bit HID.

Internet-Draft                    LISP                    September 2021


  The Berkeley Deep Drive (BDD) (https://bdd-data.berkeley.edu) Industry
  Consortium investigates computer vision technologies for automotive
  applications and for taxonomy of published automotive classification.

  These standards are combined to create an in-network state reflecting
  condition of each hexagonal tile (~1sqm) in every road. LISP network
  maps & encapsulates traffic between client endpoint identifiers (EID)
  and addressable tile-objects (HID=>EID). Objects are aggregated by
  H3 EID services.

  The H3-LISP mobility network bridges timing and location gaps between
  production and consumption of information by clients of mobility data:
   o vision, sensory, LIADR, AI applications -- information producers
   o driving-apps, map-apps, command & control -- information consumers

  This is achieved by putting the physical world on a shared addressable
  geospatial grid context of road-segments at the edge for data upload.
  Geospatial state sharing is done using a brokered-network of tile
  representation, an indirection which solves key issues in v2v
  information sharing. For example multiple vision perspectives, geo
  privacy, cyber security. These challenges arise when clients are
  asked to communicate directly when they do not really need to.
  A communication pattern which causes complexity and exposures.

  In non brokered v2v models, for a situation observable by some end
  points, it is unclear if the need-to-know end-points will receive:
  i. consistent, ii. conflicting, iii. multiple, or iv. no indications.
  As an example, when a vehicle experiences a sudden highway slow-down,
  sees brake lights or senses an accelerometer slowdown, there is no
  clear way for it to share this data with vehicles 20-30sec away.
  Or, when a vehicle crosses an intersection, observing opposite-lane
  obstruction such as: construction, double-park, commercial loading,
  garbage truck, or stopped school-bus.. there is no clear way for it
  to alert approachers from another direction as it drives away.

  Geospatial context indirection helps communicate advanced vision and
  radar annotations. As these are evolving technologies, relaying road
  enumerations using peer-to-peer poses an interoperability challenges.

  These peer-to-peer limitations are inherent yet unnecessary, in most
  situations vehicles are not really proper peers. They happen to be in
  the same place at the same time. H3-LISP mobility network solves these
  limitations of direct vehicle-to-vehicle communication by brokering
  exchanges using addressable geospatial context. Bridging timing,
  security, privacy, and interoperability gaps between endpoints.
  Brokering is achieved by clients communicating via context,
  addressable tiles which aggregated and relay data using H3 EIDs.

  Clients can provide drivers with heads-up alerts on hazards/obstacles
  beyond the line of sight of driver and in-car sensors: over traffic,
  around blocks, far-side junction, beyond road turns or curvatures.
  This highlights the importance of networks for road safety
  and role in Autonomous Vehicle (AV) operation support (AV-OSS).


  To summarize the H3-LISP solution principles are:

  (1) MicroPartition: 64bit indexed geo-state per H3.r15 road-tiles
  (2) EnumState: 64bit state values of tile condition representation
  (3) Grouping: EID per H3.r9 geo-context for its H3.r15 road-tiles
  (4) Channels: H3.r9 EIDs multicast address for geo-state updates
  (5) Scale: EID addressable contexts distributed for throughput
  (6) Overlay: tunneled-network routes the mobility-network traffic
  (7) Signal-free: overlay is used to map-register for mcast channels
  (8) Layering: overlay tunnels used between client EIDs and H3 EIDs
  (9) Access: client/server XTRs tunnel traffic to-from the LISP RTRs
  (10) Control: RTRs register-resolve H3 EIDs and mcast subscriptions

  Figure 1: 64 bit H3 ID, 64 bit compiled state value

  Each H3.r9 hexagon is an EID context with corresponding H3 hexagon ID.
  Bound to that context is a LISP xTR specified to encapsulate packets
  to and from EID context and LISP Edge. Edge RTRs are used to re
  -tunnel packets from clients to services. Each service is also a
  multicast source for updating clients on the state of the H3.r15
  tiles, aggregated by the EID addressable geospatial context.

2.  Requirements Language


3. Definition of Terms

  H3ServiceEID: Is an addressable aggregation of H3.r15 tiles.
     It functions as geospatial data association context for filtering,
     verifying, localizing, and propagating vehicles data uploads.
     It is a designated destination for physical world annotations,
     and an (s,g) source of multicast themed update channels.
     H3ServiceEID is itself an H3 hexagon, large enough to provide
     geo-spatial compute context, but not too large as to over-burden
     subscribers with too much information. For Mobility Network it is
     H3.r9. It has a light-weight LISP protocol stack to tunnel packets
     aka ServerXTR. The EID is an IPv6 EID that contains the H3 64-bit
     address numbering scheme. See IANA consideration for details.

  ServerXTR: Is a data-plane only LISP protocol stack implementation, it
     co-exists with H3ServiceEID process. When the server roams, the xTR
     is with it. ServerXTR encaps/decaps packets to/from EdgeRTRs.

  MobilityClient: Is a roaming application that may be a part of an
     automobile, part of a navigation application, part of municipal,
     state or federal government command and control application, or a
     street view consumer application. It has a light-weight LISP
     data-plane stack to tunnel packets, aka ClientXTR.

  MobilityClient EID: Is the IPv6 EID used by the Mobility Clients
     to source packets. The destination of such packets are only
     H3ServiceEIDs. The EID format is opaque and is assigned as
     part of the MobilityClient mobility-network authorization.

  ClientXTR: Is a data-plane only LISP protocol stack implementation
     co-located with the Mobility Client application. It encaps/
     decaps packets from/to applications to/from EdgeRTRs.

Internet-Draft                    LISP                    September 2021


  EdgeRTR: Is the core scale and structure of the LISP mobility network.
     EdgeRTRs proxy H3ServiceEIDs and MobilityClient H3ServiceEID mcast
     registration. EdgeRTRs aggregate MobilityClients/H3Services using
     tunnels to facilitate hosting-providers and mobile-providers for
     accessing the mobility network.  EdgeRTRs decapsulate packets
     from ClientXTRs, ServerXTRs and re-encaps packets to the clients
     and servers tunnels. EdgeRTRs glean H3ServiceEIDs/MobilityClient
     EIDs when they decapsulates packets. EdgeRTRs store H3ServiceEIDs
     and RLOCs of where the H3ServiceEID is currently reachable from
     the map-cache. These mappings are registered to the LISP mapping
     so other EdgeRTRs know where to encapsulate for such EIDs. These
     mappings may be provisioned by dev-ops when H3Services are
     assigned EdgeRTRs. EdgeRTRs do not register MobilityClients' EIDs
     at the mapping as these are temporary-renewed while using the
     mobility network. Enterprises may provide their own EdgeRTRs to
     protect geo-privacy.

Figure 2 above describes the following entities:
  - MobilityClientA sees MobilityClientB future, and, vice versa
  - Clients: share information using addressable state routed by LISP
  - ClientXTR (cXTR): encapsulates over access network to EdgeRTR
  - ServerXTR (sXTR): encapsulates over cloud network to EdgeRTR
  - H3-LISP Mobility: overlay which spans cXTRs to sXTRs
  - Uploads: routed to appropriate tile by the LISP network
  - EdgeRTRs: perform multicast replication to edges and then cXTRs
  - Clients: receive tile-by-tile geo-state updates via the multicast


4.  Deployment Assumptions

   The specification described in this document makes the following
   deployment assumptions:

   (1) Unique 64-bit HID is associated with each H3 geo-spatial tile
   (2) MobilityClients and H3ServiceEIDs share this well known index
   (3) 64-bit BDD state value is associated with each H3-indexed tile
   (4) Tile state is compiled 16 fields of 4-bits, or max 16 enums

  Figure 3: Nibble based representation- 16 fields x 16 eunms

   We name the nibbles using hexadecimal index according to the
   position where the most significant nibble has index 0.
   Values are defined in section 9.


   Subscription of MobilityClients to mobility-network is renewed
   while on the move and is not intended as the basic connectivity.
   MobilityClients use DNS/AAA to obtain temporary EIDs/EdgeRTRs
   and use (LISP) data-plane tunnels to communicate using their
   temporary EIDs with the dynamically assigned EdgeRTRs.

   MobilityClient are otherwise unaware of the LISP network control
   plane and simply regard the data-plane tunnels as a virtual
   private network (VPN) that supports IPv6 EID to upload (Ucast)
   and Subscribe-to (Mcast) H3Services.

   In order to get access to the MobilityVPN, MobilityClients first
   authenticate with the MobilityVPN AAA Server. DIAMETER [RFC6733]
   based AAA is typically done at the provider edge (PE) by gateways.
   However, the typical case involves several types of CPE connected
   to a specific service provider. The Mobility VPN, on the other hand,
   may overlay a number of wireless networks and cloud-edge providers.
   It also involves dozens of Car-OEM, Driving-Applications, Smart-
   City vendors. This is why we require clients to first go through
   AAA in order to get both a MobilityClientEID and EdgeRTR RLOC.


   ClientXTR performs the following steps to use the mobility network:
   1) obtain the address of the mobility network AAA server using DNS
   2) obtain MobilityClientEID and EdgeRTR(s) from AAA DIAMETER server
   3) renew authorization from AAA while using the mobility network

   Using this network login and re-login method we ensure that:
   - MobilityClientEIDs serve as credentials with the EdgeRTRs
   - EdgeRTRs are provisioned to whitelist MobilityClient EIDs
   - EdgeRTRs are not tightly coupled to H3.r9 areas (privacy/balance)
   - MobilityClients do not need to update EdgeRTRs while roaming

   The same EdgeRTR may serve several H3.r9 areas for ride continuity
   and several EdgeRTRs may load balance an H3.r9 area with high
   density of MobilityClients. When a MobilityClient ClientXTR is
   homed to EdgeRTR, it is able to communicate with H3ServiceEIDs.

5. Mobility Clients Network Services

  The mobility network functions as a standard LISP overlay.
  The overlay delivers unicast and multicast packets across:
   - multiple access-networks and radio-access specifications
   - multiple edge providers, public, private, and hybrid clouds

  We use data-plane XTRs in the stack of each mobility client/server.
  ClientXTRs and ServerXTRs are homed to one or more EdgeRTRs.
  This structure allows for MobilityClients to "show up" at any time,
  behind any network provider in a given mobility network admin/NAT
  domain, and for any H3ServiceEID to be instantiated, moved, or
  failed-over to any rack in any cloud-provider. LISP overlay enables
  these roaming mobility network elements to communicate uninterrupted.
  This quality is insured by the LISP RFCs. The determination of
  identities for MobilityClients to always refer to the correct
  H3ServiceEID is insured by H3 geo-spatial HIDs.

  There are two options to associate ClientXTRs with LISP EdgeRTRs:

  i. Semi-random load-balancing by DNS/AAA

  In this option we assume that in a given metro edge a pool of
  EdgeRTRs can distribute the Mobility Clients load randomly between
  them and that EdgeRTRs are topologically equivalent. Each RTR uses
  LISP to tunnel traffic to and from other EdgeRTRs for MobilityClient
  with H3Service exchanges. MobilityClients home to EdgeRTRs.

  ii. Topological by anycast

  In this option we align an EdgeRTR with topological aggregation.
  Mobility Clients are roaming in an area home to that RTR and so
  is the H3 Server. There is only one hop across the edge overlay
  between clients and servers and mcast replication is more
  focused, but clients need to keep re-homing as they move.

  To summarize the H3LISP mobility network layout:

   (1) Mobility-Clients traffic is tunneled via data-plane ClientXTRs
       ClientXTRs are (multi) homed to EdgeRTR(s)
   (2) H3ServiceEID traffic is tunneled via data-plane ServerXTR
       ServerXTRs are (multi) homed to EdgeRTR(s)
   (3) EdgeRTRs use mapping service to resolve Ucast HIDs to RTR RLOCs
       EdgeRTRs also register to (Source, Group) H3ServiceEID multicasts



       MobilityClients <> ClientXTR <Access Provider > EdgeRTR  v
                                                                v
       v < < < < Map-Assisted Mobility-Network Overlay < < < <  v
       v
       > > > > EdgeRTR <Cloud Provider> ServerXTR <> H3ServiceEID

  Figure 5: The Data Flow Between MobilityClients and H3ServiceEIDs

6. Mobility Unicast and Multicast

  Regardless of the way a given ClientXTR was associated with EdgeRTR,
  an authenticated MobilityClient EID can send: [64bitH3.15ID ::
  64bitState]annotations to the H3.r9 H3ServiceEID. The H3.r9 EID can
  be calculated by clients algorithmically from the H3.15 localization.

  The ClientXTR encapsulates MobilityClient EID and H3ServiceEID from
  the ClientXTR with the destination of the EdgeRTR RLOC LISP port.
  EdgeRTRs then re-encapsulate annotation packets either to a remote
  EdgeRTR (option 1) or to homed H3ServiceEID ServerXTR (option 2).
  The remote EdgeRTR aggregating H3ServiceEIDs re-encapsulates
  MobilityClient EID to the ServerXTR, to the H3ServiceEID.

  The headers consist of the following fields:

  Outer headers = 40 (IPv6) + 8 (UDP) + 8 (LISP) = 56
  Inner headers = 40 (IPv6) + 8 (UDP) + 4 (Nexagon Header) = 52
  1500 (MTU) - 56 - 52 = 1392 bytes of effective payload

  Nexagon Header Type allows for kv tupples of vkkk flooding
  Type 0: reserved
  Type 1:key-value, key-value.. 1392 / (8 + 8) = 87 pairs
  Type 2:value, key,key,key.. (1392 - 8) / 8 = 173 H3-R15 IDs
  Type 3-255: unassigned

  Nexagon Header GZIP allows for compression, very effective for H3IDs
  At this point we designate 001 value if content was GZIP compressed.
  Additional values may be added in the future for compression types.

  Nexagon Header kv count (in any format)

  To Summarize Unicast:

   (1) MobilityClients can send annotations are localized to H3.r15
       tile. These annotations are sent to H3.r9 mobility H3ServiceEIDs
   (2) MobilityClient EID and H3ServiceEID HID are encapsulated:
         XTR <> RTR <> RTR <> XTR
       * RTRs can map-resolve re-tunnel HIDs
   (3) RTRs re-encapsulate original source-dest to ServerXTRs
       ServerXTRs decapsulate packets to H3ServiceEID


  Each H3.r9 Server is also an IP Multicast Source used to update
  subscribers on the aggregate state of the H3.r15 tiles in the H3.r9
  server. This forms a multipoint to multipoint state channel per H3
  location, where the aggregation has compute-first propagation.


  We use [RFC8378] signal-free multicast to implement mcast channels in
  the overlay. The mobility network has many channels, with thousands
  subscribers per channel. MobilityClients driving through/subscribing
  to an H3.r9 area can explicitly issue an [RFC4604] MLDv2 in order to
  subscribe, or, may be subscribed implicitly by the EdgeRTR.

  The advantage of explicit client MLDv2 registration as [RFC8378]
  trigger is that clients manage their own mobility mcast handover per
  location-direction vectors, and that it allows for otherwise silent
  non annotating clients. The advantage of EdgeRTR implicit registration
  is that less signaling required.

  MLDv2 signaling messages are encapsulated between the ClientXTR and
  EdgeRTR, therefore there is no requirement for the underlying network
  to support native multicast. If native access multicast is supported
  then MobilityClient registration to H3ServiceEID safety channels may
  be integrated with it, in which case mobile packet-core element
  supporting it will use this standard to register with the
  appropriate H3.r9 channels in its area.

  Figure 9: Mcast update payload, value, key, key.. for larger areas


  The remote EdgeRTRs homing MobilityClients in turn replicate the
  packet to the MobilityClients registered with them.

  We expect an average of 600 H3.r15 tiles of the full 7^6 (~100K)
  possible in H3.r9 to be part of any road. The H3.r9 server can
  transmit the status of all 600 or just those with meaningful states
  based on updated SLA and policy.


  To Summarize:

   (1) H3LISP Clients tune to H3.r9 mobility updates using [RFC8378]
       H3LISP Client issue MLDv2 registration to H3.r9 HIDs
       ClientXTRs encapsulate MLDv2 to EdgeRTRs who register (s,g).


   (2) ServerXTRs encapsulate updates to EdgeRTRs who map-resolve (s,g)
       RLOCs EdgeRTRs replicate mobility update and tunnel to registered
       EdgeRTRs Remote EdgeRTRs replicate updates to ClientXTRs.

7.  Security Considerations

  The nexagon layer3 v2n network is inherently more secure and private
  then peer to peer alternatives because of the indirection. No car or
  infrastructure element communicates directly with MobilityClients.
  All information is conveyed using shared addressable geo-state.
  MobilityClients receive information only from geospatial channels
  originating from a trusted broker. MobilityClients have no indication
  as to the origin of the information. This is an important step towards
  better privacy, security, extendability, and interoperability compared
  with legacy layer2 protocols.

  In order to be able to use the nexagon mobility network for a given
  period, the mobility clients go through a DNS/AAA stage by which they
  obtain their clientEID identifiers-credentials and the RLOCs of
  EdgeRTRs they may use as gateways to the network. This MobilityClient
  <> EdgeRTR interface is the most sensitive in this network to privacy
  and security considerations.

  The traffic on the MobilityClient<>EdgeRTR interface is tunneled, and
  its UDP content may be encrypted; still, the EdgeRTR will know based
  on the LISP headers alone the MobilityClient RLOC and H3-R9 (~0.1sqkm)
  geo-spatial area to which a given client uploads or subscribes to.

  For this reason we envision the ability of enterprise or groups of
  users to "bring their own" EdgeRTRs. BYO-RTR masks individual clients'
  RLOC to H3-R9 association and is pre-provisioned to be able to use the
  mapping system and be on a white-list of EdgeRTRs aggregating
  H3ServiceEIDs. If the EdgeRTR functionality is delivered by 5GCore UPF
  then the only entity which can correlate underlay IP, User, and Geo-
  location is the regulated carrier, which can do so anyway.

  Beyond this hop, the mapping system does not hold MobilityClientEIDs,
  and remote EdgeRTRs are only aware of MobilityClient ephemeral EIDs,
  not actual RLOC or any other mobile-device identifiers. EdgeRTRs
  register in the mapping (s,g) H3-R9 multicast groups. Which clients
  use which EdgeRTR is not in the mapping system, only the AAA server is
  aware of that. The H3ServiceEIDs themselves decrypt and parse actual
  H3-R15 annotations; they also consider during this MobilityClientEID
  credentials to avoid "fake-news", but again these are only temporary
  EIDs allocated to clients in order to be able to use the mobility
  network and not for their actual IP.

  H3Services are provisioned to their EdgeRTRs, in the EdgeRTRs, and
  optionally also in the mapping system.

  In summary of main risk mitigations for the lisp-nexagon interface:

  (1) tapping: all communications are through dynamic tunnels therefore
  may be encrypted using IP-Sec or other supported point to point
  underlay standards. These are not static tunnels but LISP re-tunneling
  routers (RTRs) perform all nexagon Overlay aggregation.

  (2) spoofing: it is very hard to guess a MobilityClientEID valid for
  a short period of time. Clients and H3Services EIDs are whitelisted
  in EdgeRTRs, Clients using the AAA procedure, H3Services via dev-ops.

  (3) impersonating: efforts to use MobilityClients and H3Services RLOCs
  should be caught by the underlying service provider edge and access
  networks. EID impersonating is caught by EdgeRTR EID RLOC whitelist
  mismatch.

  (4) credibility: the interface crowd-sources geo-state and does not
  assume to trust single detections. Credit history track to
  MobilityClientEIDs by as part of normal H3Services fact checking,
  aggregate scores affect AAA credentials.

  (5) privacy: Only EdgeRTRs are aware of both clients' RLOC and
  geo-location, only AAA is aware of client IDs credentials and credit
  but not geo-location. Aggregate credit score span all H3Services
  administratively without source.
