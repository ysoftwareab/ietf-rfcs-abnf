1. Abstract 
    
   This document describes a method for identifying the originating 
   calling party for a stored VPIM message.  
    
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119. 
    
    
3. Introduction 
    
   There is currently a need for a mechanism to identify the 
   originating party of a VPIM message, outside of the "FROM" header 
   information.  The telephone number and name of the caller are 
   typically available from the telephone network, but there is no 
   obvious header field to store this in an Internet message. 
    
   This information is intended for use when the VPIM message format is 
   used for storing "Call Answer" voice messages in an Internet Mail 
   message store, i.e. the calling party leaves a voice message for the 
   recipient, who was unable to answer  the call. 
    
   [VPIMV2R2] suggests the originating number be included as an 
   Internet address, using the first method shown below. There are 
   several other ways to store this information, but they all involve 
   some manipulation of the "From" field.  For example: 
    
      1. From: "416 555 1234" <non-mail-user@host> 
      2. From: "John Doe" <4165551234@host>

      3. From:  unknown:; 
    
   As a result, it is useful to be able to store the calling party's 
   name and number as-is without manipulation.  This would allow future 
   generation of the proper Internet address, and also display of this 
   information to the recipient. 
    
   [RFC2076] currently lists "phone" as an Internet message header 
   which would hold the originating party's telephone number, but it is 
   listed as "non-standard", i.e. usage of this header is not in 
   general recommended. It also has no defined format, making the 
   information unparsable. There is no similar entry for the 
   originator's name. 
    
   It is proposed that two new message header fields be included to 
   hold this information, namely the Calling Line Identification 
   ("Caller-ID"), and Caller Name ("Caller-Name"). 
    
    
4. Calling Line Identification Field 
    
   The Calling Line Identification header ("Caller-ID") is to hold 
   sufficient information for the recipient to call back, or reply to, 
   the sender of the message.  This leads to two distinct 
   possibilities: internal and external calling. 
    
   Note that for both possibilities, this field MUST contain only the 
   digits of the number and MUST be representable using the American 
   Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) character set; it 
   does not include any separating character (e.g. "-").  
    
    
4.1 Internal Call 
    
   For an internal call (e.g. between two extensions within the same 
   company), it is sufficient to relay only the extension of the 
   calling party, based on the company dialing plan. 
    
    
4.2 External Call 
    
   For an international call, the CLID must be the full international 
   number as described in [E.164], i.e. Country Code (CC), National 
   Destination Code (NDC) and Subscriber Number (SN).  Other 
   information, such as prefixes or symbols (e.g. "+"), MUST NOT be 
   included.  This requires provisioning for up to 15 digits. 
    
   For a call within North America, it is sufficient to only include 10 
   digits as described in [GR-31-CORE].  Though it is desirable that an 
   international number NOT be truncated to 10 digits if it contains 
   more, it is recognized that this will happen due to limitations of 
   various systems. 
    
   Also note that [GR-31-Core] also specifies how to include the date 
   and time with the originating telephone number. This MAY be 
   followed, as there is an existing "Date" Internet header intended to 
   hold this information.  It is a local implementation decision

   whether this time or the local system time be recorded in the "Date" 
   header. 
    
    
5. Caller Name Field 
    
   The name of the person sending the message is also important.  If 
   available, it is to be included whether the call is internal or 
   external.  The name MUST be representable using the International 
   Reference Alphabet (IRA), formerly know as International Alphabet 
   No.5 or IA5.   This is the character set used to transmit the caller 
   name in the PSTN. 
    
   The IRA character set contains a number of options that help specify 
   national and application oriented versions. If there is no agreement 
   between parties to use these options, then the default character set 
   "International Reference Version (IRV)" will be chosen. The 
   graphical characters of IRV and ASCII are coded exactly the same.  
   As a result, for the caller name header defined in this document, 
   characters are represented with ASCII characters. 
    
   The length of the name field MUST NOT exceed 15 characters, as 
   defined in [GR-1188-CORE].  It MAY contain punctuation or white 
   spaces as appropriate. 
    
    
6. Formal Syntax 
    
   Both Calling Line Identification and Caller Line follow the syntax 
   specification using the augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) as 
   described in [RFC2234]. 
    
6.1 Calling Line Identification Syntax 
    
      "Caller-ID" ":" 1*15DIGIT CRLF 
    
6.2 Caller Name Syntax 
    
      "Caller-Name" ":" 1*15CHAR CRLF     
    
6.3 Example 
    
       To: +19725551212@vm1.mycompany.com 
       Caller-ID: 6137684087 
    
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a few scenarios that must be considered.  The first is 
   mentioned in section 2.2 - the truncation of an international number 
   to 10 digits.  This could result in a misinterpretation of the 
   resulting number.  For instance, an international number (e.g. from 
   Ireland) of the form "353 91 73 3307" could be truncated to "53 91 
   73 3307" if received in North America, and interpreted as "539 112 
   3456" - a seemingly "North American" style number.  Thus leaving the 
   recipient with the incorrect information to reply to the message.

   The second scenario is the possibility of sending an internal 
   extension to an external recipient when a Call Answer message is 
   forwarded.  This poses two problems, the recipient is given the 
   wrong phone number, and the company's dialing plan could be exposed. 
    
   The final concern deals with exercising character options that are 
   available in coding the Calling Name field. An international system 
   may send a message with coding options that are not available on the 
   receiving system. Thus giving the recipient an incorrect Caller 
   Name.
