Abstract

   RC4 is extremely weak as shown by RFC 6649 and RFC 7457, is
   prohibited in TLS by RFC 7465, is prohibited in Kerberos by RFC xxxx
   and it needs to be prohibited in all IETF protocols. Documents that
   provide technology that can only use RC4 are obsoleted by this
   document, so this document obsoletes and moves to Historic RFC 3078
   "Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) Protocol" (only supports
   RC4, RFC 3079 that is also part of that protocol is also obsoleted),
   RFC 4345 "Improved Arcfour Modes for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport
   Layer Protocol" (note Arcfour and RC4 are synonymous), RFC 4757 "The
   RC4-HMAC Kerberos Encryption Types Used by Microsoft Windows" (only
   supports RC4) and RFC 6229 "Test Vectors for the Stream Cipher RC4"
   (provides test vectors for historic cryptography). RFC 2118,
   RFC 3501, RFC 3961, RFC 4120, RFC 4253, RFC 6150, RFC 6649, RFC 6733,
   RFC 7457, RFC 7905 and RFC xxxx are updated to note the deprecation
   of RC4 in all IETF protocols. (Please do not confuse RFC 4757 with
   RFC 7457.)

1. Introduction

   RC4 is extremely weak [RFC6649, RFC7457, RFCxxxx] and this document
   deprecates its use in all IETF protocols, including Kerberos and
   Secure Shell (SSH). The reasons for obsoleting RFC 3078, RFC 3079,
   RFC 4345 and RFC 4757 and moving them to Historic are discussed in
   Section 2. The updates to RFC 2118, RFC 3501, RFC 3961, RFC 4120,
   RFC 4253, RFC 6150, RFC 6649, RFC 6733, RFC 7457, RFC 7905 and
   RFC xxxx and the reasons for doing them are specified in sections 3,
   4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, respectively. The status of

   the updated RFCs as of the writing of this document is available in
   Appendix A.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119, RFC8174].

2. Why obsolete those RFCs and move them to Historic

   RFC 3078 is no longer used by supported Microsoft Windows versions
   and is moved to Historic and obsoleted by this document as it only
   supports RC4 for encryption. RFC 2118 is updated to note the
   moving of RFC 3078 (that updated RFC 2118) to Historic and its
   obsoleting. RFC 3079, that is effectively part of RFC 3078, is also
   moved to Historic as it only supports RC4 for encryption.

   RFC 4345 defines the "arcfour-128" and "arcfour-256" modes for Secure
   Shell (SSH), and is moved to Historic as RC4 is extremely
   weak [RFC6649, RFC7457, RFCxxxx] and there is research that is at
   least 5 years old that totally breaks all practical usage of
   RC4 [RFC6649].

   RFC 4757 is obsoleted and moved to Historic as it is no longer used
   by supported Microsoft Windows versions (support for Windows XP ended
   8 April 2014, any unofficial support for officially unsupported
   Microsoft Windows versions will certainly remove RC4) and specifies
   RC4-HMAC as used by Microsoft Windows in Kerberos, that should have
   been obsoleted, not updated, by RFC 6649. RFC xxxx also obsoletes
   RFC 4757. Additionally, MD4 is extremely weak and not
   one-way [RFC6150] and this is another reason to move RFC 4757 to
   Historic, as well as the myriads of other reasons specified
   in [RFC6150].

   RFC 6229 provides test vectors for RC4 and is obsoleted and moved to
   Historic by this document as RC4 is deprecated in all IETF protocols.

3. Updates to RFC 2118

   RFC 2118 is updated to note the obsoleting of RFC 3078 and the
   moving of RFC 3078 to Historic (see Section 2).

4. Updates to RFC 3501

   In Section 11.1 of [RFC3501], it is stated that:

   """
   IMAP client and server implementations MUST implement the
   TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 {TLS} cipher suite, and SHOULD implement the
   TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA {TLS} cipher suite.  This is
   important as it assures that any two compliant implementations can be

Internet-Draft      Deprecating RC4 in all Protocols           July 2017

   configured to interoperate.  All other cipher suites are OPTIONAL.
   Note that this is a change from section 2.1 of {IMAP_TLS}.
   """

   [[References were replaced with curly braces to avoid nits. When
   publishing, revert back to references.]]

   The above paragraph of [RFC3501] required that implementations of
   IMAP clients and servers implement a RC4 cipher suite in TLS
   (contradicts [RFC7465]) and recommends implementing a weak cipher
   suite (DSA is not recommended by some sources and 3DES is used in
   the suite). Unfortunately, at the time of writing of RFC 3501,
   AES cipher suites were extremely new (the first AES cipher suites
   were defined in RFC 3268, published in June 2002), less than 1 year
   old and the strongest choice they have come up with at the time was
   TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA.

   As the document is over 14 years old, the above paragraph of [RFC3501]
   is replaced with the following paragraph:

   """
   IMAP client and server implementations were formerly required to
   implement TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 {TLS}, an extremely weak cipher
   suite [RFC6151, RFC6649, RFC7457, RFCxxxx, RFCyyyy] that TLS clients
   MUST NOT implement per [RFC7465]. Compatibility requirements were
   removed in the grounds of security, and all clients and servers
   SHOULD implement TLS 1.2 {TLS} and the
   TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 {TLS} cipher suite.
   """

   The TLS reference in [RFC3501] should be replaced with a reference to
   RFC 5246, and references to RFC 6151, RFC 6649, RFC 7457, RFC 7465,
   RFC xxxx and this document (as RFC yyyy) should be added.

5. Updates to RFC 3961

   RFC 3961 is updated to note the deprecation of rc4-hmac and
   rc4-hmac-exp (referred to in Section 8 of [RFC3961]). rc4-hmac is
   NOT RECOMMENDED by [RFCxxxx] and rc4-hmac-exp is NOT RECOMMENDED
   by [RFC6649].

6. Updates to RFC 4120

   RFC 4120 is updated to note the deprecation of rc4-hmac and
   rc4-hmac-exp.

7. Updates to RFC 4253

   RFC 4253 is updated to note the deprecation of arcfour and 3des-cbc.

Internet-Draft      Deprecating RC4 in all Protocols           July 2017

   This document changes "OPTIONAL" to "NOT RECOMMENDED" for arcfour and
   "REQUIRED" to "OPTIONAL" for 3des-cbc in the table of
   Section 6.3 of [RFC4253] as 3DES is weak and maintaining the
   requirement will compromise systems. [RFC4253] was published in 2006,
   11 years ago, and states that """At some future time, it is expected
   that another algorithm, one with better strength, will become so
   prevalent and ubiquitous that the use of "3des-cbc" will be
   deprecated by another STANDARDS ACTION."""

   The "future time" referred to by [RFC4253] is set to 2017, the
   "STANDARDS ACTION" is set to the publication of this document and
   the "algorithm" is set to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), as
   AES is ubiquitous in Kerberos implementations (see Section 11).

   The paragraph on RC4 (called "arcfour" in [RFC4253]) in
   Section 6.3 of [RFC4253] currently reads:
   """
   The "arcfour" cipher is the Arcfour stream cipher with 128-bit keys.
   The Arcfour cipher is believed to be compatible with the RC4 cipher
   [SCHNEIER].  Arcfour (and RC4) has problems with weak keys, and
   should be used with caution.
   """

   It should read:
   """
   The "arcfour" cipher is the Arcfour stream cipher with 128-bit keys.
   The Arcfour cipher is believed to be compatible with the RC4 cipher
   [SCHNEIER].  Arcfour (and RC4) are extremely weak [RFC6649, RFC7457,
   RFCxxxx, RFCyyyy] and therefore their use is NOT RECOMMENDED.
   """

   References to RFC 6649, RFC 7457, RFC xxxx and this document (the
   reference to this document is RFCyyyy in the above paragraph) should
   be added to Section 6.3 of [RFC4253].

8. Updates to RFC 6150

   RFC 6150 moves MD4 to Historic. Note the RFC contains a typo: "MD2"
   should be "MD4". RFC 6150 references RFC 4757, obsoleted by this
   document, as using MD4. The expression "with the one exception of
   Microsoft's use of MD4 as part of RC4-HMAC in Windows,", as well as
   all expressions indicating algorithms using RC4 are a problem to the
   deprecation of MD4, should be removed from Section 4 of [RFC6150].

9. Updates to RFC 6649

   RFC 6649, also known as BCP 179, deprecates DES, RC4-HMAC-EXP and
   other weak cryptography in Kerberos. It is updated to note the
   deprecation of rc4-hmac and the deprecation of RC4 in all IETF
   protocols.

Internet-Draft      Deprecating RC4 in all Protocols           July 2017

   The security considerations of [RFC6649] (Section 6 of [RFC6649])
   read, in their last paragraph:

   """
   The security considerations of [RFC4757] continue to apply to
   RC4-HMAC, including the known weaknesses of RC4 and MD4, and this
   document does not change the Informational status of [RFC4757] for
   now.  The main reason to not actively discourage the use of RC4-HMAC
   is that it is the only encryption type that interoperates with older
   versions of Microsoft Windows once DES and RC4-HMAC-EXP are removed.
   These older versions of Microsoft Windows will likely be in use until
   at least 2015.
   """

   This is updated to note that Windows XP is without official support
   for 3 years (support for Windows XP ended 8 April 2014).

   An important quote from [RFC6649] (Section 6 of [RFC6649]):
   """
   Removing support for single DES improves security because DES is
   considered to be insecure.  RC4-HMAC-EXP has a similarly inadequate
   key size, so removing support for it also improves security.
   """

10. Updates to RFC 6733

   Section 13.1. of [RFC6733] currently reads:
   """
   Diameter nodes MUST be able to negotiate the following TLS/TCP and
   DTLS/SCTP cipher suites:

         TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5
         TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA
         TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA

   Diameter nodes SHOULD be able to negotiate the following TLS/TCP and
   DTLS/SCTP cipher suite:

         TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

   Note that it is quite possible that support for the
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite will be REQUIRED at some
   future date.  Diameter nodes MAY negotiate other TLS/TCP and DTLS/
   SCTP cipher suites.
   """

   The above paragraphs required that clients implement two RC4 cipher
   suites and a 3DES cipher suite (but recommends implementing an AES
   cipher suite).

Internet-Draft      Deprecating RC4 in all Protocols           July 2017

   RFC 6733 was published in October 2012, and the above paragraphs
   of [RFC6733] are to be replaced with:

   """
   Diameter nodes were formerly required to implement insecure RC4
   cipher suites and weak 3DES cipher suites. RC4 MUST NOT be used
   because it is prohibited by RFC 7465.

   Diameter nodes MUST support at least one of the following cipher
   suites:

         TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
         TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
         TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
         TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
         TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
         TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
         TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256
         TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256
         TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
         TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA was not chosen to be absolutely required
   as Diameter nodes may require all connections to use forward secrecy
   by only implementing cipher suites with forward secrecy.
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA is not a forward secrecy cipher suite
   because all connections can be decrypted once the private RSA key is
   known by an attacker.
   """

   Several choices were given because of patent concerns with Elliptic
   Curve Cryptography (ECC) and problems of older implementations with
   ECC and GCM cipher suites.

11. Updates to RFC 7457

   RFC 7457, an Informational RFC describing attacks against Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), is
   updated to note the deprecation of RC4 in all IETF protocols.

12. Updates to RFC 7465

   RFC 7465 prohibits RC4 cipher suites in Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) and is updated to note the deprecation of RC4 in all IETF
   protocols.

13. Updates to RFC 7905

   RFC 7905, describing the ChaCha20-Poly1305 stream cipher to replace
   RC4 in Transport Layer Security (TLS), is updated to note the
   deprecation of RC4 in all IETF protocols, including TLS. [RFC7465],

   that prohibited RC4 cipher suites, did not update RFC 7905, so this
   document will do so.

14. Updates to RFC xxxx

   RFC xxxx deprecates 3DES and RC4 in Kerberos, obsoletes RFC 4757 and
   updates RFC 3961, and is updated by this document to note the
   moving of RC4 RFCs (RFC 4345 and RFC 6229) and Microsoft technology
   dependent on RC4 (RFC 3078 and RFC 4757).

   An important quote from [RFCxxxx] (Section 5.4 of [RFCxxxx]):
   """
   Fortuntately, modern (i.e., supported) Kerberos implementations
   support a secure alternative to RC4, in the form of AES.  Windows has
   supported AES since 2007-2008 with the release of Windows Vista and
   Server 2008, respectively; MIT Kerberos [MITKRB5] has fully supported
   AES (including the GSSAPI mechanism) since 2004 with the release of
   version 1.3.2; Heimdal [HEIMDAL] has fully supported AES since 2005
   with the release of version 0.7.  Though there may still be issues
   running ten-year-old unsupported software in mixed environments with
   new software, issues of that sort seem unlikely to be unique to
   Kerberos, and the aministrators of such environments are expected to
   be capable of devising workarounds.
   """
   (note the quote contains typos: "Fortuntately" and "aministrators")

15. Action to be taken

   RC4 MUST NOT be used in new implementations of IETF protocols, and
   RC4 MUST be eliminated as fast as possible from the existing Internet
   infrastructure, as RC4 is extremely weak [RFC6649, RFC7457, RFCxxxx].
   New RFCs MAY use the phrase "RC4 is extremely weak [RFC6649, RFC7457,
   RFCxxxx]" with references to RFC 6649, RFC 7457 and RFC xxxx. Whether
   the references to these documents is normative or informative is
   determined by BCP 9 and BCP 97, whose relevant documents for this
   purpose are RFC 2026, RFC 3967, RFC 4897, RFC 6410 and RFC 8067.

   Microsoft Corporation SHOULD take action to eradicate RC4 in all
   its software and systems.

   New IETF protocols MUST NOT allow RC4, and new versions of existing
   IETF protocols MUST either not allow RC4 or recommend not to use RC4
   (for example, using "NOT RECOMMENDED" or "SHOULD NOT").

16. IANA Considerations

   IANA may need to take action as the status for RC4 and 3DES
   algorithms for Secure Shell (SSH) is changed by this document
   (see Section 6, that updates [RFC4253]).
