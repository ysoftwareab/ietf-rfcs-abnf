     Abstract 
         
        Assured Service refers to the set of capabilities used to ensure 
        that mission critical communications are setup and remain connected. 
        [Pierce1] describes the requirements, one of which is to provide 
        preferential treatment to higher priority calls. IEPS refers to a 
        set of capabilities used to provide a higher probability of call 
        completion to emergency calls made by authorized personnel, usually 
        from ordinary telephones. This also requires some form of 
        preferential treatment. This memo describes some of the methods 
        which may be applied to provide that preferential treatment. 
         
        This is intended as an informational memo.

     1.   Introduction 
        [Pierce1] defines the requirements for Assured Service in support of 
        networks requiring precedence treatment for certain calls, such as 
        the US military network. One of those requirements is Preferential 
        treatment, which is the following: 
         
        It must be possible to provide preferential treatment to higher 
        precedence calls in relation to lower precedence calls. Examples of 
        preferential treatments are: 
         
        -   reservation of network resources for precedence calls 
             
        -   usage of higher Call Acceptance limits for higher precedence 
            calls

        -   preferential queuing of signaling messages based on precedence 
            level 
             
        -   preferential queuing of user data packets based on precedence 
            level 
             
        -   discarding of packets of lower precedence call 
             
        -   preemption of one or more existing calls of lower precedence 
            level 
             
        -   preemption of some of the resources being used by a call of 
            lower precedence level 
             
        -   preemption of the reservation of resources being held for other 
            traffic 
         
        Several current drafts describe the requirements for provision of 
        the International Emergency Preparedness Scheme (IEPS). This service 
        requires some types of preferential treatment for these calls, which 
        can be viewed as a subset of the requirements for Assured Service 
        listed above. These requirements include: 
         
        -   higher probability of call completion 
             
        -   lower probability of premature disconnect 
             
        -   distinguish IEPS data packets from other types of VoIP Packets 
            in order to give them "priority". 
             
        -   Alternate path routing 
         
        This informational memo describes some ways in which the above 
        listed preferential treatments may be provided by utilizing current 
        or new capabilities. 
         
         
     2.   Background 
         
        The requirement for Precedence Level Marking of a call setup attempt 
        will be met by the use of the Resource Priority header defined in 
        [Polk2]. The value carried in this header represents the relative 
        precedence level of the call, and is used to control any of the 
        following described procedures for providing Preferential Treatment. 
         
         
     3.   Potential Preferential Treatments 
         
        The requirement to provide preferential treatment to calls may be 
        met by applying any combination of the following procedures: 
         
     3.1. Reservation of Network Resources 
         
      
     Mike Pierce               Expires April 2003                  [Page 3] 
     Internet Draft    Examples of Preferential Treatment      October 2002 

        This procedure involves pre-reserving certain network resources 
        during periods when no higher precedence traffic is present so as to 
        be prepared to handle a given level of high precedence traffic in 
        the case of an emergency. While this method is already used in the 
        circuit switched environment, it is less than desirable since it 
        requires a tradeoff between the amount of wasted resources during 
        non-emergency periods and the amount of emergency traffic which can 
        be handled using those reserved facilities. 
         
        IETF defined QoS mechanisms for packet-mode operation offer some 
        improvement to this situation by allowing the amount of reserved 
        resources to be adjusted. 
      
     3.1.1. RSVP 
         
        RSVP may be used to establish multiple trunk groups between 
        switching points, with each trunk group serving a different 
        precedence level of calls. Each trunk group would be sized based on 
        the number of simultaneous calls of that precedence level to be 
        supported. (In this context, a trunk group refers to a facility 
        which can support a certain number of voice connections at a certain 
        Quality of Service level. As noted later, the number of connections 
        can be increased with a corresponding decease in the QoS level.) 
         
        With TE, the reserved sizes of these trunk groups could be adjusted 
        during times of emergency. 
         
        No preemption of these trunk groups is needed. However, reducing the 
        size of a group to near zero would prevent further calls from using 
        it while allowing existing calls to continue. 
         
     3.1.2. MPLS 
         
        MPLS may be used to establish the equivalent of dedicated trunk 
        groups between switching entities, enterprise network, etc. Each of 
        these "trunk groups" could exist to support a specific precedence 
        level of traffic between two points and could be setup using the 
        procedures defined in [RFC3212] or those in [RFC3209]. These support 
        the signaling of the required five levels of precedence. 
         
     3.1.2.1.  Constraint-based LSP Setup using LDP 
         
        [RFC3212] defines an extension to LDP to provide a constraint-based 
        routing using MPLS. One of the constraints is based on the notion of 
        a "priority" level for the new setup. It includes the signaling of a 
        setup priority and a holding priority with the value of each being 
        0-7 (0 is the highest priority). When setting up an LSP as a trunk 
        group to carry the traffic of one of the expected precedence levels 
        defined in [Pierce1], the following mapping would be used:

        + ------------------------------------------+ 
        | Assured Service  | RFC3212 Preemption TLV | 
        | Precedence       |------------------------| 
        | Level            |  SetPrio  |  HoldPrio  | 
        |------------------+-----------+------------| 
        | Routine          |     4     |     0      | 
        | Priority         |     3     |     0      | 
        | Immediate        |     2     |     0      |

        + ------------------------------------------+ 
         
        This mapping prevents any preemption of a trunk group for the 
        establishment of another. Rather, it is expected that trunk groups 
        for all precedence levels would be initially created and remain. 
        Only their allocated size might be changed. 
         
        If actual preemption were desired, the appropriate HoldPrio values 
        would be used. 
         
     3.1.2.2.  RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels 
         
        As an alternative to LDP, [RFC3209] defines the use of RSVP with 
        extensions to perform the label distribution for MPLS. It also 
        includes the same setup and holding priorities as defined in 
        [RFC3212]. When using RSVP as the label distribution protocol, the 
        same mapping shown above for LDP would be used. 
         
     3.2. Use of Higher Call Acceptance Limits 
         
        One aspect of preferential treatment may be provided, without 
        resorting to preemption of calls, by allowing higher precedence 
        calls to be setup even when they result in exceeding the engineered 
        traffic limit on a facility (on an MPLS LSR, for example). 
         
        For example, the limits for call acceptance for new calls could be 
        set as depicted in the following table, where the engineered 
        capacity of a route or facility is "x". A new call of each 
        precedence level would be allowed only if the current load is within 
        the limit shown: 
         
        +------------------------------+ 
        | Precedence Level | Capacity  | 
        |                  | limit of  | 
        |------------------+-----------| 
        | Routine          |   .9x     | 
        | Priority         |  .95x     | 
        | Immediate        |     x     | 
        | Flash            |  1.2x     | 
        | Flash-override   |  1.3x     | 
        +------------------------------+ 
         
        Explanation of table: In this example, a new Flash call is allowed 
        to be setup if the current traffic load for all traffic on the

        facility is less than 1.2x. In the example shown in this table, 
        Routine traffic is always prevented from using the last 10% of the 
        capacity. The choice of the multipliers would be based on an 
        analysis of the tradeoff between getting the high precedence level 
        call through vs. sacrificing of QoS. It would depend on the voice 
        encoding algorithms typically used and the end user expectations. 
         
        This procedure is based on a requirement that Flash override calls 
        should "never" be blocked. (In a probability-based system, there is 
        no such thing as "never".) In the circuit-switched environment this 
        could only be guaranteed by having as many circuits as there might 
        be Flash override calls. For IP-based service, there is no fixed 
        number of "circuits" on any facility. The "x" referred to above is 
        only an engineering limit based on a guarantee for the provision of 
        a certain QoS for normal traffic, i.e., Routine and Priority. This 
        "x" may be thought of as the number of "circuits" for normal 
        traffic. It is preferable to allow the setup of additional higher 
        precedence calls with reduced QoS rather than blocking their setup. 
        For example, while a particular facility may support 100 normal 
        calls (Routine and Priority) at the guaranteed QoS, it might support 
        130 flash-override calls at a reduced, yet acceptable, QoS (due to 
        packet loss) when in an emergency situation. 
         
        Since the packet preferential treatment using Diff-Serv described in 
        Section 3.4 and 3.5 could result in the discard or loss of the 
        packets for the lower precedence calls, the higher precedence calls 
        could still be provided a sufficient QoS even though they may have 
        caused the engineered capacity of the route to be exceeded. The 
        lower precedence calls will then experience higher packet discard 
        rates or queuing delay times. If the discard rate or delay for these 
        lower precedence calls is excessive, the end user will experience 
        poor QoS and will likely disconnect, thereby freeing up the 
        resources. 
         
        This "encouraged disconnect" may be thought of as a "graceful 
        preemption". 
         
     3.3. Preferential Queuing of Signaling Messages 
         
        There is no plan to apply preferential queuing of signaling 
        messages, just as this was not done in the circuit switched network. 
        No advantage can be shown for such a procedure and it would only 
        aggravate the problem of out-of-order messages. 
         
     3.4. Preferential Queuing of User Data Packets 
         
        It is not expected that priority queuing of user data packets would 
        provide a useful capability. It would only tend to prevent the lower 
        priority packets from achieving the behavior required. 
         
     3.5. Discarding of Packets 
         
     3.5.1. Use of DiffServ

        Within DiffServ, Assured Forwarding [RFC2597] provides four classes 
        and three drop precedences for each class (12 DSCP code points). One 
        of these classes would be used for the signaling messages for 
        session establishment and release. AF is not considered as being 
        appropriate for interactive voice. 
         
        Expedited Forwarding [RFC3246] defines a single class (DSCP code 
        point) and operation, but does not include multiple drop precedences 
        as AF does. The intention of EF is to "provide low loss, latency and 
        jitter" and is understood to be intended for traffic such as speech, 
        although RFC 3246 does not explicitly mention speech or voice. 
        However, speech is less susceptible to loss than the signaling 
        traffic and, under some traffic situations, will constitute a much 
        larger portion of the overall load. Therefore, multiple drop 
        precedences to alleviate overload are more appropriate to EF than 
        they are to AF. 
         
        The result of this use of DiffServ classes is that voice packets are 
        always given priority over the signaling packets and all voice 
        packets are treated the same. While this is the desired behavior in 
        many cases, it is not desired in those cases in which a limited 
        sized facility could become completely occupied by voice traffic 
        (using EF). In this situation, further signaling messages (using 
        AF), including those to setup new high precedence calls and those to 
        release low precedence calls, would be lost or excessively delayed. 
         
        Therefore, it is necessary to reserve a small capacity for use by 
        the AF class which serves the signaling traffic as described in 
        Section 2.10 of RFC 3246. 
         
        For that portion of the capacity using EF for voice, the required 
        preferential treatment for the five call precedence levels may be 
        provided by the use of multiple drop precedence (probability) levels 
        for packets. The procedures for the interworking of these drop 
        precedence levels would be the same as defined currently for AF 
        [RFC2597]. 
         
        Five such levels for packet marking, using DSCPs, are necessary to 
        provide the required functionality. In the absence of "standardized" 
        DSCP values, local values will be assigned. Based on the definitions 
        for AF, these levels are referred to here as: 
         
        -   Very low (i.e., lowest probability of being dropped) 
        -   Low 
        -   Medium 
        -   High 
        -   Very high (i.e., highest probability of being dropped) 
         
        The following possible mappings are shown to illustrate the concept 
        of using DiffServ codepoints to assist in the provision of 
        preferential treatment to the individual packets which make up the 
        information transfer (both the connection setup signaling and the 
        voice transfer) of an Assured Service call.

     3.5.2. Treatment for Signaling Packets 
         
        Consideration could also be given to utilization of different drop 
        precedences for the signaling messages of different precedence 
        sessions. However, using SS#7 in the PSTN as a basis, it might also 
        be meaningful to provide different drop precedences based on type of 
        message rather than only based on the precedence of the call. For 
        example, for routine traffic, those messages which cause the release 
        of sessions could be given a lower drop precedence than those which 
        set up new sessions in order to allow such releases to take place 
        properly under overload conditions. High precedence calls, on the 
        other hand could use a lower drop precedence level for session setup 
        messages than those of routine precedence calls. The following table 
        shows what is defined for SS#7 [T1.111], including High Probability 
        of Completion [T1.631] and MLPP [T1.619], and what might be used for 
        SIP. 
         
        (Note: The highest SS#7 Congestion Priority Level, i.e., "3", is the 
        last to be dropped during congestion.)

        Note: Within SIP, all ACKs would need to have the same preferential 
        treatment as the message they are acknowledging. 
         
     3.5.3. Treatment for Voice Packets 
         
        This example is for the case of the use of DiffServ to provide the 
        packet forwarding preferential treatment through multiple drop 
        precedence levels. Each packet containing user data (voice) is 
        marked with a unique DiffServ codepoint to indicate one of the 
        following levels and resulting treatment:

        |--------------+-------+------------|-----------------+ 
        |Routine       |  EF   |  Very high |      80%        | 
        |Priority      |  EF   |    High    |      90%        | 
        |Immediate     |  EF   |   Medium   |     100%        | 
        |Flash         |  EF   |    Low     |     110%        | 
        |Flash Override|  EF   |  Very low  |     120%        | 
        +-----------------------------------+-----------------+ 
         
        All voice traffic is then served by a single instance of EF, and 
        served by a single (strict FIFO) queue. This results is an equal 
        treatment in terms of delay variation (often called "jitter") for 
        all precedence levels for those packets which are delivered, but 
        achieves this by selective packet discard. The discard may use a 
        simple tail dropping algorithm as shown in the above table or a form 
        of "Random Early Detection" as described in [RFC2309] to drop some 
        packets before the queue actually reaches the fill shown above. 
        However, since the packets in this queue are not using TCP and can 
        not be bursty or "agressive", there appears to be no advantage 
        gained by the complexity of early detection and random dropping. 
         
        Note that "queue full" here refers to the engineered limit, that is, 
        the limit which should be applied in order to meet the requirements 
        of the EF PHB and the desired QoS. Since this calculation is based 
        on probabilities of achieving a certain target QoS, it can be 
        temporarily exceeded as described in the following section. 
         
     3.6. Preemption of One or More Existing Calls 
         
        The procedures described above for use of higher call acceptance 
        limits and selective discard of voice packets based on the 
        precedence level of the call reduce or eliminate the need to perform 
        preemption of existing calls within the IP domain. The statistical 
        nature of packet transmission makes it possible to "squeeze" an 
        additional high precedence call into an already "full" facility, as 
        illustrated in the previous section. It should be noted that, in the 
        extreme case, these procedures would result in the same effect as 
        preemption, since the resources of the lower precedence call would 
        be so severely degraded (via packet loss) that communication would 
        be impossible and the users would likely disconnect. 
         
        When interworking with circuit switched portions of the 
        telecommunications network, preemption procedures are still required 
        within transport facilities which are based on fixed numbers of 
        circuits. In some cases, this preemption must result in specific 
        procedures being applied in the packet portion, such as 
        notifications of preemption.

     4.   Preemption of Some of the Resources Being Used 
         
        The "preemption" of some of the resources being used by lower 
        precedence traffic may be accomplished through the packet discard 
        described above. 
         
     4.1. Preemption of the Reservation 
         
        Based on traffic engineering, the amount of resources allocated to 
        reserved paths (e.g., MPLS or RSVP) could be adjusted. For example, 
        when an emergency situation occurs, the need for more resources to 
        support higher priority traffic could be recognized. The existing 
        LSPs could be changed using the procedures of [RFC3214] to allow the 
        size of those LSPs supporting the higher priority traffic to be 
        increased while others are decreased. 
         
     4.2. Others 
         
        There may be other procedures which could be used to provide the 
        required preferential treatments. 
         
         
     5.   Security Considerations 
         
        The security considerations are covered in [Pierce1]. 
         
         
     6.   IANA Considerations 
         
        It is not expected that there will be any IANA involvement in 
        support of provision of Preferential Treatment for Assured Service 
        beyond what is described in [Polk2].
