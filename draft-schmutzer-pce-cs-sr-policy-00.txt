                 Circuit Style Segment Routing Policies
                  draft-schmutzer-pce-cs-sr-policy-00

Abstract

   This document describes how Segment Routing (SR) policies can be used
   to satisfy the requirements for strict bandwidth guarantees, end-to-
   end recovery and persistent paths within a segment routing network.
   SR policies satisfying these requirements are called "circuit-style"
   SR policies (CS-SR policies).

1.  Introduction

   There are several applications that require strict bandwidth
   guarantees, end-to-end recovery and persistent paths through the
   network.  Such a "transport centric" behavior is referred to as
   "circuit-style" in this document.

   This document describes how SR policies
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] and adjacency-SIDs defined
   in the SR architecture [RFC8402] together with a stateful Path
   Computation Element (PCE) [RFC8231] can be used to statisfy those
   requirements.  It includes how end-to-end recovery and path integrity
   monitoring can be implemented.

   SR policies that satisy those requirements are called "circuit-style"
   SR policies (CS-SR policies).

2.  Terminology

   *  CS-SR : Circuit-Style Segment Routing

   *  ID : Identifier

   *  LSP : Label Switched Path

   *  LSPA : LSP attributes

   *  OAM : Operations, Administration and Maintenance

   *  OF : Objective Function

   *  PCE : Path Computation Element

   *  PCEP : Path Computation Element Communication Protocol

   *  PT : Protection Type

   *  SID : Segment Identifier

   *  SLA : Service Level Agreement

   *  SR : Segment Routing

   *  STAMP : Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol

   *  TI-LFA : Topology Independent Loop Free Alternate

   *  TLV : Type Length Value

3.  Requirements of CS-SR Policies

   The requirements of circuit-style SR policies (CS-SR policies) are as
   follows:

   *  Persistent end2end traffic engineered paths that provide
      predictable and identical latency in both directions

   *  Strict bandwidth commitment per path to ensure no impact on the
      Service Level Agreement (SLA) due to changing network load from
      other services

Internet-Draft                   cs-srte                  September 2021


   *  End2end protection (<50msec protection switching) and restoration
      mechanisms

   *  Monitoring and maintenance of path integrity

   *  Data plane remains up while control plane is down

4.  Architecture Overview

   CS-SR policies are following the segment routing architecture
   [RFC8402] and SR policy architecture
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

   By nature of CS-SR policies, paths wil be computed and maintained by
   a stateful PCE defined in [RFC8231].  When using a MPLS data plane
   [RFC8660], PCEP extensions defined in [RFC8664] will be used.  When
   using a SRv6 data plane [RFC8754], PCEP extensions defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] will be used.

   A simplified architecture is shown in Figure 1.

5.  PCE Topology

   In order to satisfy the requirements of CS-SR policies, each link in
   the topology MUST have: * An adjacency-SID which is: * Manually
   allocated or persistent : to ensure that its value does not change
   after a node reload * Non-protected : to avoid any local TI-LFA
   protection to happen upon interface/link failures * The bandwidth
   available for CS-SR policies

Internet-Draft                   cs-srte                  September 2021


   Existing IGP extensions defined in [RFC8667] and [RFC8665] can be
   used to distribute the topology information including those
   persistent and unprotected Adj-SIDs when using a MPLS dataplane
   [RFC8660].  When using a SRv6 dataplane [RFC8754] the IGP extensions
   defined in [I-D.ietf-lsr-isis-srv6-extensions] and
   [I-D.ietf-lsr-ospfv3-srv6-extensions] apply.

6.  CS-SR Policy Characteristics

   A CS-SR policy had the following characteristics:

   *  Requested bandwidth : bandwidth to be reserved for the CS-SR
      policy

   *  Bidirectional co-routed : a CS-SR policy between A and Z is an
      association of an SR-Policy from A to Z and an SR-Policy from Z to
      A following the same path(s)

   *  Not automatically recomputed or reoptimized : the SID list of a
      candidate path must not change automatically (for example upon
      topology change)

   *  Multiple candiate paths in case of protection/restoration:

      -  Following the SR policy architecture, the highest preference
         valid path is carrying traffic

      -  Depending on the protection/restoration scheme (Section 9) ,
         lower priority candidate paths

         o  may be pre-computed

         o  may be pre-programmed

         o  may have to be disjoint

   *  Liveness and performance measurement is activated on each
      candidate path (Section 8)

7.  CS-SR Policy Creation

   A CS-SR policy between A and Z is configured both on A (with Z as
   endpoint) and Z (with A as endpoint) as shown in Figure 1.








Schmutzer, et al.         Expires 3 April 2022                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                   cs-srte                  September 2021


   Both nodes A and Z act as PCC and delegate path computation to the
   PCE using the extensions defined in [RFC8664].  Considering a CS-SR
   policy that has no protection/restoration requirement, the PCRpt
   message sent from the headends to the PCE contains the following
   parameters:

   *  BANDWIDTH object (Section 7.7 of [RFC5440]) : to indicate the
      requested bandwidth

   *  LSPA object (section 7.11 of [RFC5440]) : to indicate the local
      protection requirements

      -  L flag set to 0 : no local protection

      -  E flag set to 1 : protection enforcement (section 5 of
         [I-D.ietf-pce-local-protection-enforcement])

   *  ASSOCIATION object ([RFC8697]) :

      -  Type : Double-sided Bidirectional with Reverse LSP Association
         ([I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path])

      -  Bidirectional Association Group TLV ([RFC9059]) :

         o  R flag is always set to 0 (forward path)

         o  C flag is always set to 1 (co-routed)

   If the SR-policies are configured with more than one candiate path, a
   PCEP request is sent per candidate path.  Each PCEP request does
   include the "SR Policy Association" object (type 6) as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp] to make the PCE aware of the
   candidate path belonging to the same policy.

8.  Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)

8.1.  Liveness

   The proper operation of each segment list is validated by both
   headends using STAMP in loopback measurement mode as described in
   section 4.2.3 of [I-D.ietf-spring-stamp-srpm].

   As the STAMP test packets are including both the segment list of the
   forward and reverse path, standard segment routing dataplane
   operations will make those packets get switched along the forward
   path to the tailend and along the reverse path back to the headend.

Internet-Draft                   cs-srte                  September 2021


   The headend forms the bidirectional SR Policy association using the
   procedure described in [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path] and receives the
   information about the reverse segment list from the PCE as described
   in section 4.5 of [I-D.ietf-pce-multipath]

8.2.  Performance Measurement

   The same STAMP session used for liveliness monitoring can be used to
   measure delay.  As loopback mode is used only round-trip delay is
   measured and one-way has to be derived by dividing the round-trip
   delay by two.

   The same STAMP session can also be used to estimate round-trip loss
   as described in section 5 of [I-D.ietf-spring-stamp-srpm].

9.  Recovery Schemes

   Various protection and restoration schemes can be implemented.  The
   terms "protection" and "restoration" are used with same subtle
   distinctions outlined in section 1 of [RFC4872], [RFC4427] and
   [RFC3386] respectively.

   *  Protection : another candidate path is computed and fully
      established in the data plane and ready to carry traffic

   *  Restoration : a candidate path may be computed and may be
      partially established but is not ready to carry traffic

   When protection and/or restoration is required the SR polices are
   configured with two or more candidate paths.  The PCRpt messages
   include the "Path Protection Association" object (type 1) defined in
   [RFC8745].

9.1.  Unprotected

   In the most basic scenario no protection nor restoration is required.
   The SR-policy only has one candidate path configured.

   In case of a failure the CS-SR policy will go down and traffic will
   not be recovered.

9.2.  1:1 Protection

   For fast recovery against failures a second candidate with a lower
   preference is configured.  Its path is pre-computed and pre-
   programmed so that upon detection of a failure traffic can be
   immediately directed to this alternate path by the headend.

Internet-Draft                   cs-srte                  September 2021


   For the highest preference candidate path the parameters of the "Path
   Protection Association TLV" defined in [RFC8745] are set as follows:

   *  Protection Type (PT) is set to 0x04 to indicate "1:N Protection
      with Extra-Traffic" as defined in section 14.1 of [RFC4872]

   *  P bit is set to 0 to indicate this is the "working" path

   *  S bit is set to 0 but will be ignored

   For the lower preference candidate path the parameters are as
   follows:

   *  Protection Type (PT) is set to 0x04 to indicate "1:N Protection
      with Extra-Traffic"

   *  P is set to 1 to indicate this is the "protect" path

   *  S bit set to 0 to indicate "primary"

   Appropriate routing of the protect path diverse from the working path
   can be requested from the PCE by using the "Disjointness Association"
   object (type 2) defined in [RFC8800] in the PCRpt messages.  The
   disjoint requirements are communicated in the "DISJOINTNESS-
   CONFIGURATION TLV"

   *  L bit set to 1 for link diversity

   *  N bit set to 1 for node diversity

   *  S bit set to 1 for SRLG diversity

   *  T bit set to enforce strict diversity

   The P bit may be set for first candidate path to allow for finding
   the best working path that does satisfy all constraints without
   considering diversity to the protect path.

   The "Objective Function (OF) TLV" as defined in section 5.3 of
   [RFC8800] may also be added to minimize the common shared resources.

   As described in Section 8.1, both headends will generate and receive
   their own loopback mode test packets, hence even a unidirectional
   failure will always be detected by both headends and therefore no
   protection switch coordination is required.
