            Message Size Overhead of CoAP Security Protocols
                draft-mattsson-core-security-overhead-00

Abstract

   This document analyzes and compares per-packet message size overheads
   when using different security protocols to secure CoAP.  The analyzed
   security protocols are DTLS 1.2, DTLS 1.3, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, and
   OSCOAP.  DTLS and TLS are analyzed with and without compression.
   DTLS are analyzed with two different alternatives for header
   compression.

1.  Introduction

   This document analyzes and compares per-packet message size overheads
   when using different security protocols to secure CoAP over UPD
   [RFC7252] and TCP [I-D.ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls].  The analyzed
   security protocols are DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347], DTLS 1.3
   [I-D.rescorla-tls-dtls13], TLS 1.2 [RFC5246], TLS 1.3
   [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13], and OSCOAP [I-D.ietf-core-object-security].
   The DTLS and TLS record layers are analyzed with and without
   compression.  DTLS are analyzed with two different alternatives
   ([RFC7400] and [raza-6lo-compressed-dtls]) for header compression.

2.  Overhead of Security Protocols

   To enable comparison, all the overhead calculations in this section
   use AES-CCM with a tag length of 8 bytes, a plaintext of 6 bytes, and
   the sequence number '05'.  This follows the example in [RFC7400],
   Figure 16.

2.1.  DTLS 1.2

   This example is taken directly from [RFC7400], Figure 16.  The nonce
   follow the strict profiling given in [RFC7925].

   DTLS 1.2 Record Layer (35 bytes, 29 bytes overhead):
   17 fe fd 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 05 00 16 00 01 00
   00 00 00 00 05 ae a0 15 56 67 92 4d ff 8a 24 e4

   Ciphertext:
   ae a0 15 56 67 92
   ICV:
   4d ff 8a 24 e4 cb 35 b9

   DTLS 1.2 gives 29 bytes overhead.

2.2.  DTLS 1.2 with 6LoWPAN-GHC

   Note that the compressed overhead is dependent on the parameters
   epoch, sequence number, and length.  The following is only an
   example.

   Note that the sequence number '01' used in [RFC7400], Figure 15 gives
   an exceptionally small overhead that is not representative at all.

   Note that this header compression is not available when DTLS is
   exchanged over transports that do not use 6LoWPAN together with
   6LoWPAN-GHC.

   and 9 bytes overhead for responses.

   Unlike DTLS and TLS, OSCOAP has much smaller overhead for responses
   than requests.

3.  Overhead with Different Sequence Numbers

   The compression overhead (GHC) is dependent on the parameters epoch,
   sequence number, and length.  The following overheads should be
   representative for sequence numbers with the same length.

   The compression overhead (raza-6lo-compressed-dtls) is dependent on
   the length of the parameters epoch and sequence number.  The
   following overheads apply for all sequence numbers with the same
   length.

   The OSCOAP overhead is dependent on the included CoAP Option numbers,
   if the CoAP method allows payload, as well as the length of the
   OSCOAP parameters Sender ID and sequence number.

            Figure 1: Overhead as a function of sequence number

4.  Summary

   DTLS 1.2 has quite a large overhead as it uses an explicit sequence
   number and an explicit nonce.  DTLS 1.3, TLS 1.2, and TLS 1.3 have
   significantly less overhead.

   Both DTLS compression methods provides very good compression. raza-
   6lo-compressed-dtls achieves slightly better compression but requires
   state.  GHC is stateless but provides slightly worse compression.  As
   DTLS 1.3 uses the same version number as DTLS 1.2, both GHC and raza-
   6lo-compressed-dtls works well also for DTLS 1.3.

   The Generic Header Compression (6LoWPAN-GHC) is not very generic (the
   static dictionary is more or less a DTLS record layer) and the
   compression of TLS is significantly worse than the compression of
   DTLS.  Similar compression levels as for DTLS could be achieved also
   for TLS, but this would require different static dictionaries for
   each version of TLS (as TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 uses different version
   numbers).

   The header compression is not available when (D)TLS is exchanged over
   transports that do not use 6LoWPAN together with 6LoWPAN-GHC or raza-
   6lo-compressed-dtls.

   OSCOAP has much lower overhead than DTLS and TLS.  The overhead of
   OSCOAP is smaller than DTLS over 6LoWPAN with compression, and this
   small overhead is achieved even on deployments without 6LoWPAN or
   6LoWPAN without DTLS compression.  OSCOAP is lightweight because it
   makes use of some excellent features in CoAP, CBOR, and COSE.
