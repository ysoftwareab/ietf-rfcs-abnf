                     draft-ietf-iasa2-rfc7776bis-03

Abstract

   The IETF Anti-Harassment Procedures are described in RFC 7776.

   The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) has been replaced
   by the IETF Administration LLC, and the IETF Administrative Director
   has been replaced by the IETF LLC Executive Director.  This document
   updates RFC 7776 to amend these terms.

   RFC 7776 contained updates to RFC 7437.  draft-ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis
   has incorporated those updates, so this document also updates RFC
   7776 to remove those updates.

   The IAOC has been replaced by the IETF Administration LLC, and the
   IETF Administrative Director has been replaced by the IETF LLC
   Executive Director.  This document updates RFC 7776 to amend these
   term and to update a reference.

   RFC 7776 contained updates to [RFC7437].  [I-D.ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis]
   has incorporated those updates, so this document also updates RFC
   7776 to remove those updates.

   This document makes no other changes to the procedures described in
   RFC 7776.

2.  Changes to RFC 7776

   Section 3.4 of RFC 7776 [RFC7776] is about Qualifications and
   Training.  The last paragraph of that section is replaced as follows:

   OLD

      Ombudsteam shall take professional advice and will consult with
      the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) with respect to

   NEW

      In determining the appropriate training, the IETF Chair and

      budget.

   END

      writing to the IETF Secretariat and/or IETF Administrative
      Director (IAD) to take action as appropriate.

   NEW

      Where specific action is required to ensure that a remedy is
      realized or enforced, the Ombudsteam will make a request in
      writing to the IETF Secretariat and/or IETF LLC Executive Director
      to take action as appropriate.

   END

2.3.  Changes to References to RFC 7437

   RFC 7776 updated RFC 7437 [RFC7437] by allowing the Obmudsteam to
   form a recall petition.  This document does not change any of the
   associated processes, however during the process of documenting the
   replacement of the IAOC by the IETF Administration LLC, RFC 7437 has
   been obsoleted by [I-D.ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis], and as part of that
   work, [I-D.ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis] has included the update from RFC
   7776.

   This document updates RFC 7776 to remove the update of RFC 7437.

2.3.1.  Changes to Metadata

   The following change is made to the metadata at the head of
   [RFC7776]:

   OLD

      Updates: 2418, 7437

   NEW

      Updates: 2418

   END

2.3.2.  Changes to the Abstract

   The following change is made to text in the Abstract of [RFC7776]:

   DELETE

      This document updates RFC 7437 by allowing the Ombudsteam to form
      a recall petition without further signatories.

   END

2.3.3.  Changes to Section 5.1

   The following change is made to text in Section 5.1 of [RFC7776]

   OLD

   o  Many IETF management positions are appointed by the NomCom with
      confirmation from the IESG, IAB, or ISOC.  [RFC7437] describes the
      recall procedure for such appointments.  This document updates
      [RFC7437] by allowing the Ombudsteam to form a recall petition on
      its own and without requiring 20 signatories from the community.
      Such a petition shall be treated in all ways like any other recall
      petition as described in [RFC7437]: that is, the fact of the
      petition and its signatories (the Ombudsteam) shall be announced
      to the IETF community, and a Recall Committee Chair shall be
      appointed to complete the Recall Committee process.  It is
      expected that the Recall Committee will receive a briefing from
      the Ombudsteam explaining why recall is considered an appropriate
      remedy.

   NEW

   o  The Ombudsteam may form a recall petition on its own without
      requiring signatures from the community as described in
      [I-D.ietf-iasa2-rfc7437bis].

   END
