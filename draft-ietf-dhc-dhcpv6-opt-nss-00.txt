Abstract

   This document describes a new option called Name Service Search Option
   to specify the order in which name services should be consulted by the
   client when resolving host names and other information.

1. Introduction

   DHCPv6 specification [1] allows DHCPv6 server to convey various kinds
   of name services to the DHCPv6 clients through the options like DNS 
   Servers Option [2], NIS Servers Option [3] and NIS+ Servers Option [3].
   The clients can use multiple name services. Currently, there is no
   way by which the client can be notified with the search order for the
   name services. This document defines a new option by which the server
   can pass the search order for the name services to the clients.

2. Requirements

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [5]


3. Terminology

   This document uses terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCPv6 as defined
   in "Terminology" section of the DHCPv6 specification [1].

4. Name Service Search Option

   The Name Service Search Option lists the one or more option codes of
   the name services in the order of preference. The first listed name
   service will be first used for resolution.

   The format of the Name Service Search Option is as shown below:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            OPTION_NSS         |         option-len            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |         NS Option code        |       NS Option code          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                              ...                              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   option-code:   OPTION_NSS (tbd)

   option-len: Length of the 'NS Option code' fields in octets; It must 
               be a multiple of 2.

   NS Option code: 2 bytes option code of Name service represented
               in network byte order.

   The following list gives the various name services and their 
   corresponding option codes.

        Name Service                                Option code
    Domain Name Servers Option                    OPT_DNS_SERVERS
    Network Information Servers Option            OPT_NIS_SERVERS
    NetBIOS over TCP/IP Name Server Option       OPT_NBNS_SERVERS
    Network Information Service+ Servers Option  OPT_NISP_SERVERS

    The value of OPT_DNS_SERVERS is defined in [2] and the values of 
    OPT_NIS_SERVERS and OPT_NISP_SERVERS are defined in [3]. Currently 
    the values are `tbd`. IANA has been requested to assign a value for 
    these options. Currently, there is no DHCPv6 option to deliver NetBIOS
    over TCP/IP Name Server (NBNS) [4] addresses to the clients. So, the 
    value of OPT_NBNS_SERVERS is `tbd`.

Internet-Draft     The Name Service Search Option for DHCPv6    Oct 2003


    The NS Option code of 0 is to indicate that the client should refer 
    to local naming information (e.g., an /etc/hosts file on a UNIX 
    machine).

    Example:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            OPTION_NSS         |             6                 |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |         OPT_DNS_SERVERS       |       OPT_NIS_SERVERS         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |               0               |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    This means, the client has to first use DNS, then NIS and then the
    local naming information like /etc/hosts for name service.

5. Client Behaviour

    The client should use this option to create search list for name 
    service.

    i) If the DHCPv6 server doesn't provide the information about one or 
    more name services listed in this option and these service are 
    supported in the client and the client is configured to access these 
    services, it can either use the information about these name services
    configured by some other mechanism external to DHCPv6 (or) it can try
    to obtain the information about these name services from the 
    alternative DHCPv6 servers (or) it can ignore these name services
    and keep the remaining name services in the search list in the same 
    relative order as before. For example, assume that the server provides
    the search list as (1) DNS (2) NIS+ and (3) NetBIOS and the server 
    has not provided NIS+ server addresses to the client. The client 
    supports NIS+ and it is configured to use NIS+. The client can 
    either get the information about NIS+ servers through some other 
    mechanisms like manual configuration database (or) it can contact 
    alternative DHCPv6 servers to obtain NIS+ server addresses. If both 
    mechanisms doesn't succeed, it can ignore NIS+ and keep (1) DNS 
    and (2) NetBIOS in its search list with DNS and NetBIOS in same 
    relative order as before.
    
    ii) The client may receive this option with some name services, which 
    are not supported by client (or) it has not been configured to access.
    In this case, it can ignore these name services and create the search
    list removing these name services with relative order of the remaining
    name services not changed.

    This specification does mandate any strict rules to be followed
    for the cases i) and ii). However, it provides the guidelines
    which will be helpful for the implementors. For all these cases 
    the client can interpret this option in a system-specific manner 
    whose specification is outside the scope of this document.

6. Appearance of this option

   The Name Service Search option MUST NOT appear in other than the 
   following messages: Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind, 
   Information-Request and Reply.

   The option number for this option MAY appear in the Option Request
   Option [1] in the following messages: Solicit, Request, Renew,
   Rebind, Information-Request and Reconfigure.

7. Security Considerations

   The Name Service Search Option may be used by an intruder DHCPv6 
   server to provide a search list which contain only the name services 
   which are not supported in the client. This will make the clients
   unable to resolve the names and other information.
   
   The Name Service Search Option may be used by an intruder DHCPv6 
   server to provide a search list with lower precedence given to the
   service which provide better results. For example, local naming 
   information like /etc/hosts, which doesn't have adequate information
   for name and other resolutions, will be given higher precedence in the 
   search list. This will degrade the performance of the applications 
   running on the client as they have to perform lookup multiple times 
   with different name services to resolve the names and other 
   information. If these applications are very critical like banking 
   services, which require higher throughput, this will result in Denial 
   Of Service.

   To avoid attacks through this option, the DHCP client SHOULD use 
   authenticated DHCP (see section "Authentication of DHCP messages" 
   in the DHCPv6 specification [1]).

8. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to the following options
   from the option-code space defined in "DHCPv6 Options" section of the
   DHCPv6 specification [1].



      Option Name            Value    Described in
       OPTION_NSS             tbd       Section 4
   OPTION_NBNS_SERVERS        tbd       Section 4
