1.2. Definitions 

   In this document we refer to a fault as the inability of a function 
   to perform a required action. This does not include an inability due 
   to preventive maintenance, lack of external resources, or planned 
   actions. See also ITU-T G.806 [3]. 

   In this document we refer to a defect to as the situation for which 
   density of anomalies has reached a level where the ability to perform 
   a required function has been interrupted. See also ITU-T G.806 [3]. 

   In this document, we refer to MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) as a 
   set of MPLS functions used to support packet transport services and 
   network operations. 

   In this document we refer to a MPLS Section as a network segment 
   between two LSRs that are immediately adjacent at the MPLS layer. 

   OAM packets can be inserted and extracted at various reference 
   points, referred to as Maintenance Points (MP). These MPs are further 
   characterized with regard to their position along the entity being 
   monitored. The MPs can be end-points (Maintenance End Point, MEP) or 
   intermediate points (Maintenance Intermediate Point, MIP). A MEP is 
   capable of initiating and terminating OAM packets for fault 
   management and performance monitoring. A MIP is capable of reacting 
   to some OAM packets but does not initiate OAM packets. Therefore, 
   LERs and T-PEs can be MEPs while LSRs and S-PEs can be MIPs. In case 
   of Tandem Connection Maintenance Entity (defined below), LSRs and S-
   PEs can be MEPs. 

   This document defines the following Maintenance Entities: 

   o  The PW Maintenance Entity, corresponding to end-to-end PW 
      monitoring (between T-PEs). 

 
 
Vigoureux et al.       Expires January 7, 2009                 [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft       OAM Requirements for MPLS-TP             July 2008 
    

   o  The LSP Maintenance Entity, corresponding to end-to-end LSP 
      monitoring (between LERs). 

   o  The Tandem Connection Maintenance Entity (TCME), corresponding to 
      one or more segment(s) of a PW or to a segment (a.k.a. sub-path) 
      of a LSP. 
      Note that: 
      - A TCME could be defined between the two T-PEs of a SS-PW but 
      there is no specific relevance to define such a TCME as it 
      corresponds to the PW Maintenance Entity. 
      - A TCME can be defined between a T-PE and any S-PE (and vice-
      versa) or between any two S-PEs on a given MS-PW. A TCME can span 
      several PW segments, i.e. the PEs (T-PEs or S-PEs) where MEPs are 
      located need not be adjacent on the MS-PW. 
      - A TCME can be defined between a LER and any LSR (and vice-versa) 
      or between any two LSRs, for that LSP. These points (LERs, LSRs) 
      where MEPS are located do not need to be adjacent on the LSP. A 
      TCME defined between the two LERs of a LSP corresponds to the LSP 
      Maintenance Entity. 
      - The LSP or MS-PW segment(s) that the TCME covers may however be 
      dependant on administrative boundaries in case the LSP or the MS-
      PW spans multiple domains. 
      - End-points of a TCME are MEPs, not MIPs. 

   A Maintenance Entity can be viewed as the association of two (or 
   more) Maintenance End Points that should be provisioned and managed. 
   Each OAM flow is associated to a unique ME. MEPs of a given ME 
   generate and/or terminate the OAM messages associated to the ME. 
    
   The monitoring of a Maintenance Entity can only be performed at 
   points where the Label associated with the Maintenance Entity is the 
   top most label of the stack. 

   TCMEs MAY be nested but MUST NOT overlap. 

1.3. Context and Motivations 

1.3.1. Transport Profile of MPLS 

   This section does not give any requirement on MPLS-TP. Its sole 
   intent is to describe the context in which the OAM requirements could 
   fit and is for information only. The authors intend to move it to 
   another draft at a later stage. 

   A transport network must provide a means to commit, to the client 
   signal, the quality of service and availability objectives. These 
   objectives can be expressed in the form of a Service Level Agreement 
 
 
Vigoureux et al.       Expires January 7, 2009                 [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft       OAM Requirements for MPLS-TP             July 2008 
    

   (SLA). A transport network must also provide a means to monitor 
   compliance to an agreed quality of service. 

   Two important attributes of MPLS-TP (as in any transport network 
   technology) are that 

   o  it is independent from both client and server networks. That is, 
      demarcation points exist between MPLS-TP and the customer layer, 
      and between MPLS-TP and the underlying tunnelling or point-to-
      point technology. 

   o  it is consistent with existing transport network operations and 
      management models [8]. 

   The purpose of a transport network is to transparently carry client 
   signals (i.e. the stream of client PDUs or client bits), across the 
   network, between ingress and egress (typically over several nodes). A 
   key characteristic of transport networks is their ability to monitor 
   and therefore maintain the integrity of the client signal between 
   ingress and egress ports of the transport network. 

   Networks deploying MPLS-TP are configured so as not to use specific 
   MPLS capabilities such as ECMP, label merging (i.e. for mp2p 
   purposes) and PHP. In the case of bidirectional connectivity, the 
   forward and backward directions are congruent (i.e. they follow the 
   same path and the pairing relationship between the forward and the 
   backward directions is known in each node traversed by bidirectional 
   LSPs). 

   Just as for other transport technologies and associated transport 
   networks, the presence of a distributed control plane in support of 
   network operations is optional, and the absence of such control plane 
   should not affect the ability to operate the network and to use MPLS-
   TP forwarding, OAM and protection capabilities. 

   Finally, some MPLS-TP specific recovery mechanisms are independent of 
   a control plane. They rely on OAM capabilities such as APS to trigger 
   protection switching in the absence of a control plane. 

1.3.2. Motivations 

   In the context of MPLS Transport Profile the rationales for OAM 
   mechanisms are twofold as they can serve as:

Internet-Draft       OAM Requirements for MPLS-TP             July 2008 
    

   o  As a network-oriented mechanism (used by a transport network 
      operator) to monitor his network infrastructure and to implement 
      internal mechanisms in order to enhance the general behaviour and 
      the level of performances of his network (e.g. protection 
      mechanism in case of node or link failure). For example fault 
      localization is typically associated to this use case. 

   o  As a service-oriented mechanism (used by a transport service 
      provider) to monitor his offered services to end customers it 
      order to be able to react rapidly in case of a problem and to be 
      able to verify some of the SLA parameters (i.e. performance 
      monitoring) negotiated with the end customer. A transport service 
      could be provided over several networks or administrative domains 
      that may not be all owned and managed by the transport service 
      provider. 

   More generally, OAM is an important and fundamental functionality in 
   transport networks as it contributes to 

   o  the reduction of operational complexity and costs, by allowing 
      efficient and automatic detection, localisation, handling, and 
      diagnosis of defects, and by minimizing service interruptions, 
      operational repair times, and operational resources. 

   o  the enhancement of network availability, by ensuring that defects 
      resulting in misdirected customer traffic are detected/diagnosed 
      and can lead to appropriate consequent actions minimizing the 
      number of defects that are not detected automatically before a 
      customer reports the problem. 

   o  meet service and performance objectives, by running OAM 
      functionality which allows SLA verification in a multi-maintenance 
      domain environment and allows the determination of service 
      degradation due to, for example, packet delay or packet loss. 

   This is achieved through the support of FCAPS functionality, as 
   described in ITU-T M.3400 [2], itself relying on OAM related 
   information. 

2. OAM Requirements 

   This section lists the requirements by which the OAM functionality of 
   MPLS-TP should abide. Some requirements for this application are 
   similar to some of those listed in RFC 4377 [7]. 

   The requirements listed below may be met by one or more toolsets, the 
   definition or selection of these toolsets is outside the scope of 
 
 
Vigoureux et al.       Expires January 7, 2009                 [Page 7]

   this document. However, it is required that the specified solution 
   MUST inter-work with the existing MPLS and PW OAM toolset. 

2.1. Architectural Requirements 

   OAM functions SHOULD be independent of the underlying tunnelling or 
   point-to-point technology. 

   OAM functions SHOULD be independent of the service a pseudowire may 
   emulate (e.g. Ethernet). 

   The set of OAM functions operated on each Maintenance Entity SHOULD 
   be independent one from another. The set of OAM functions must be a 
   self-sufficient set that does not require external capabilities to 
   achieve the OAM objectives. 
   Note that independence should not be understood here in terms of 
   isolation but in terms of separate running processes. There should be 
   one OAM process running per Maintenance Entity but different OAM 
   running processes could interact (e.g. alarm summarization).  

   OAM functions MUST operate and be configurable even in the absence of 
   a control plane. Conversely, OAM functions SHOULD be configurable as 
   part of connectivity (LSP or PW) management. Note that means for 
   configuring OAM functions and connectivity management are outside the 
   scope of this document. 

   The service emulated by a single segment of multi-segment pseudowire 
   may span multiple domains. The LSP itself, supporting the pseudo-
   wire(s), may span multiple domains. It MUST be possible to perform 
   OAM functions on a per domain basis and across multiple domains. 
   Furthermore, in case of a fault or defect on the service, means MUST 
   be available for the service provider to be informed of the fault 
   even if the fault is located outside its domain. 

   OAM functions operate at the data plane. OAM packets MUST run in-
   band. That is, OAM packets for a specific destination MUST follow the 
   same data path as data traffic for this destination. This is known as 
   fate sharing. 

   It MUST be possible to discriminate data traffic from OAM packets. 
   This includes a means to differentiate OAM packets from data traffic 
   as well as the capability to apply specific treatment to OAM packets. 

   OAM functionality MUST NOT be dependent on IP routing and forwarding 
   capabilities as these may not be available in networks where MPLS-TP 
   is deployed. 

 
 
Vigoureux et al.       Expires January 7, 2009                 [Page 8] 

Internet-Draft       OAM Requirements for MPLS-TP             July 2008 
    

   OAM functions MUST be able to be used for PWs and LSPs and Section. 
   Furthermore, since LSPs MAY be stacked, OAM functions MUST be able to 
   be run at each network layer (i.e. any level of the label stack). 

   OAM functions MUST be applicable to bidirectional point-to-point 
   connections, and a subset of these OAM functions MUST be applicable 
   to unidirectional point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections. 
   This subset is based on the nature of both the OAM functions and the 
   connections to which they can apply. The tables below (Table 1 and 
   Table 2) summarize the applicability of OAM functions. 

   OAM functions SHOULD continue to meet their objectives regardless of 
   congestion conditions. See also ITU-T Y.1541 [4]. 

2.2. Functional Requirements 

   In cases where the OAM of the native service of an AC or a PW type 
   does not provide mechanisms to propagate failure conditions 
   information, while a downstream indication of such state is needed, 
   MPLS-TP OAM SHOULD provide mechanisms for propagating AC failures and 
   their clearance across a MPLS-TP domain. 

   If a defect or fault occurs, mechanisms MUST be provided to detect 
   it, diagnose it, localize it, and notify the appropriate entities. 
   Corrective actions SHOULD be taken according to the type of defect or 
   fault. 

   In the case of the PW Maintenance Entity, OAM mechanisms provided 
   SHOULD ensure that customers do not have to detect faults. The OAM 
   functions SHOULD allow the service provider to automatically detect 
   and notify the faults associated with a PW Maintenance Entity. 

   An alarm suppression and summarization mechanism MUST be provided. 
   For example, a fault detected at the LSP level MUST NOT trigger 
   various alarms at the PW level. 

   The following two tables describe the required OAM functions 
   constituting the MPLS-TP OAM toolset for Fault Management and 
   Performance Management applications. In these tables, MEP stands for 
   monitoring from MEP to MEP, MIP stands for monitoring from MEP to 
   MIP, U stands for unidirectional, B stands for bidirectional. Crosses 
   (x) indicate a required function, numbers indicate a required 
   function while pointing to a footnote providing additional details. 

   Appendix A provides a short description of the OAM functions 
   typically supported in ITU-T defined transport networks. It is the 
   expectation that MPLS-TP will provide an equivalent set.

Table 2 : OAM Functions for Performance Management 

   Note: In case a misconnection is detected, proactive Performance 
   Management MUST be suspended until the misconnection has been 
   repaired; i.e. all request/response OAM needs to be treated with 
   caution as it cannot be assumed to function reliably, e.g. if traffic 
   is leaking in a unidirectional sense with no return path. 

   The use of OAM functions SHOULD be optional for the operator. A 
   network operator SHOULD be able to choose which OAM functions to use

   and which Maintenance Entity to apply them to. However, it is 
   recommended that connectivity verification is performed on every 
   Maintenance Entity in order to reliably detect connectivity defects. 

   OAM functions such as Continuity Check (CC) and Connectivity 
   Verification (CV) MUST NOT rely on user traffic. Dedicated OAM CV and 
   CC flows SHOULD be used to detect continuity and connectivity 
   defects. See also ITU-T G.806 [3]. 

   As part of the design of OAM mechanisms for MPLS-TP, a mechanism MUST 
   be provided enabling the realization of a channel for general purpose 
   signalling, e.g. for control, management and OAM information, that is 
   associated with the data plane paths. 

   The design of OAM mechanisms for MPLS-TP MUST allow the ability to 
   support vendor specific and experimental OAM functions. 

   Finally, the OAM mechanisms in support of these requirements SHALL be 
   extensible and thus SHALL NOT preclude additional OAM functions in 
   the future. 

2.3. Performance Requirements 

   To be incorporated in a future revision of this document 

3. Security Considerations 

   Mechanisms SHOULD be provided to ensure that unauthorized access is 
   prevented from triggering any OAM function. 

   OAM messages MAY be authenticated. 

   An OAM packet for a Maintenance Entity MUST NOT leak out of the ME, 
   i.e. go beyond the terminating MEP. 

   Architectural aspects for security concerning MPLS-TP are described 
   in Clause 13 of ITU-T G.8110.1 [5]. 

4. Congestion Considerations 

   A mechanism (e.g. rate limiting) MUST be provided to prevent OAM 
   messages from causing congestion in the PSN. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   There are no IANA actions required by this draft.

APPENDIX A : OAM Functions Information 

   This Appendix provides a short description of the OAM functions 
   typically supported in ITU-T defined transport networks. 

A.1. Continuity Check 

   Continuity Check (CC) is a function that is used to detect loss of 
   continuity between MEPs. 

   CC is useful for applications like Fault Management, Performance 
   Monitoring and Protection Switching, etc. 

   CC should be supported both in pro-active and on-demand modes. In 
   pro-active mode it may be supported for both bidirectional and 
   unidirectional connections. 

   In on-demand mode, CC should be supported for bidirectional 
   connections both between MEPs and between a MEP and a particular MIP 
   along the connection. 

A.2. Connectivity Verification 

   Connectivity Verification (CV) is a function that is used to check 
   connectivity between MEPs in a single maintenance domain. 

   CV should be supported both in pro-active and on-demand modes. In 
   pro-active mode it may be supported for both unidirectional and bi-
   directional connections. 

   In on-demand mode, CV should be supported for bidirectional 
   connections both between MEPs and between a MEP and a particular MIP 
   along the connection. 

A.3. Alarm Suppression 

   Alarm Suppression is a function that is used by a server layer MEP to 
   notify a failure condition to its client layer MEP(s) in order to 
   suppress alarms that may be generated by maintenance domains of the 
   client layer as a result of the failure condition in the server 
   layer. 

   Alarm Suppression should be supported in proactive mode only, for all 
   both unidirectional and bi-directional connections.

A.4. Lock Indication 

   Lock Indication is a function that is used to indicate an 
   administrative locking of a server layer MEP which may result in 
   consequential interruption of data traffic forwarding towards the 
   client layer MEP(s) expecting this traffic. The reception of a Lock 
   Indication allows a MEP to differentiate between a defect condition 
   and an administrative locking action at the server layer MEP. 

   Lock indication should be supported in pro-active mode only. 

A.5. Packet Loss Measurement 

   Packet Loss Measurement is a function that is used to measure packet 
   loss ratio between a pair of MEPs. Packet Loss Ratio is the ratio of 
   the service packets not delivered to the total number of service 
   packets transmitted during a set time interval. The number of service 
   packets not delivered is the difference between the number of service 
   packets transmitted by the source node and the number of service 
   packets received at the destination node. 

   Packet loss Measurements can be performed by a MEP to measure near-
   end packet loss on unidirectional connections and near-end and far-
   end packet loss on bidirectional connections. Where, near-end packet 
   loss refers to packet loss associated with ingress data packets while 
   far-end packet loss refers to packet loss associated with egress data 
   packets. 

   The measurement of packet loss ratio should be supported in pro-
   active mode for both unidirectional and bi-directional connections. 

A.6. Diagnostic Test 

   A diagnostic test is a function that is used between MEPs to verify 
   bandwidth throughput, packet loss, bit errors, etc. 

   This function may be used in on-demand mode for either unidirectional 
   or bi-directional connections. 

A.7. Trace-route 

   Trace-route is a function that is used to determine the route of a 
   connection across the MPLS transport network. 

   Trace-route should be supported in on-demand mode for bi-directional 
   connections between a pair of MEPs or between a MEP and a MIP.

A.8. Delay Measurement 

   Delay Measurement is a function that is used to measure one-way or 
   two-way delay of a packet transmission between a pair of MEPs. Where, 

   o  One-way packet delay is the time elapsed from the start of 
      transmission of the first bit of the packet by a source node until 
      the reception of the first bit of that packet by the destination 
      node. 

   o  Two-way packet delay is the time elapsed from the start of 
      transmission of the first bit of the packet by a source node until 
      the reception of the last bit of the loop-backed packet by the 
      same source node, when the loopback is performed at the packet's 
      destination node. 

   This function may be used in on-demand mode. 

A.9. Remote Defect Indication 

   Remote Defect Indication (RDI) is a function that used by a MEP to 
   notify its peer MEP of a detection of a defect on a bi-directional 
   connection between them. 

   This function should be supported in pro-active mode. 

A.10. Client Signal Fail 

   Client Signal Fail function (CSF) is used to propagate a Client 
   Failure indication to the far-end sink when alarm suppression in the 
   client layer is not supported. Upon receiving a packet with CSF 
   information a MEP detects a client-layer failure condition and 
   notifies its client-layer. 

   Upon receiving signal fail indication from its client-layer the MEP 
   should immediately start transmitting periodic packets with CSF 
   information. A MEP should continue to transmit periodic packets with 
   CSF information until the client-layer failure indication is removed. 

   Transmission of packets with CSF information can be enabled or 
   disabled on a MEP.
