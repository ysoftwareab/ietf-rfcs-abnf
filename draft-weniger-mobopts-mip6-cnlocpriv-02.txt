Abstract

   This draft discusses the problem of correspondent node-targeted
   location privacy in Mobile IPv6 and proposes a mechanism to achieve
   simultaneous optimized routing and strong correspondent node-targeted
   location privacy.  The mechanism utilizes the MIPv6 bootstrapping
   mechanisms and does neither require any new network entities nor
   changes to home agent or correspondent node implementations.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

   The terminology of [2] and [3] is used.  Additionally, the following
   terms are introduced:

   IP Reachability Home Agent (IRHA):  A home agent as specified in [2]
      that provides IP reachability and global session continuity for
      the mobile node.

   Home Address for IP Reachability (HoA_IR):  A home address used for
      IP reachability and session continuity and that is registered at
      the IRHA.  This home addresses is disclosed to potential
      correspondent nodes (e.g., by publishing the address in DNS).

   Optimized path:  A path between mobile node and correspondent node
      that is shorter than the IP reachability path, but may be longer
      than the optimal path.  The IP Reachability path is the path
      between mobile node and correspondent node if the mobile node uses
      bi-directional tunneling mode with the IRHA.  The optimal path is
      the end-to-end path between mobile node and correspondent node,
      e.g., the path in MIPv6 Route Optimization mode.

   Optimized routing:  Routing data packets over the optimized path

   Optimized Routing Home Agent (ORHA):  A home agent as specified in
      [2] that is used for providing optimized routing.  It must support
      the bootstrapping mechanisms specified in [3] and should be
      located close to the correspondent node.

   Home Address for Optimized Routing (HoA_OR):  A home address used for
      optimized routing and session continuity and that is registered at
      the ORHA.  This home address is usually not public (i.e., not
      published in DNS).

   Eavesdropper-targeted location privacy:  Hiding the mobile node's
      location from nodes eavesdropping on the path between mobile node
      and correspondent node (and home agent)

   Correspondent node-targeted location privacy:  Hiding the mobile
      node's location from the correspondent node

2.  Introduction and Problem Definition

   Location privacy is the ability to hide a user's location from other
   users.  This is considered to be an important feature, since
   disclosure of the location can have serious impacts on the user's
   life.  In general, location privacy can be achieved by hiding the
   relation between identity and location of a user.  In Mobile IPv6
   [2], the care-of address and the home address typically represent
   topological location and identity of a mobile node, respectively.
   Note that a dynamically assigned home address does not represent a
   permanent identity itself, but a mapping to one of the mobile node's
   permanent identifiers is typically published for IP reachability
   reasons (e.g., in DNS), so that other nodes are able to find out the
   mobile node's current home address to initiate a session with the
   mobile node.  Consequently, in Mobile IPv6 at least either the
   care-of address or the home address must be hidden from anyone that
   is not authorized to obtain the location of the mobile node.  Two
   rather orthogonal sub-problems of location privacy for Mobile IPv6
   can be distinguished: hiding the location from eavesdroppers on the
   path and hiding the location from the correspondent node, which we
   henceforth call eavesdropper-targeted and correspondent node-targeted
   location privacy, respectively (see [4] for details about the Mobile
   IPv6 location privacy problem).  This document is concerned with
   correspondent node-targeted location privacy only, especially with
   the problem of providing optimized routing at the same time.
   Eavesdropper-targeted location privacy is out of scope, but can be
   achieved by combining the mechanisms in this draft with pseudo home
   address mechanisms [10].  Any location privacy issues not directly
   related to Mobile IPv6 are out of the scope of this document.

   An example scenario illustrating the problem is the following: A
   mobile node wants to hide its location and uses Mobile IPv6 with a
   public home address to be reachable.  This address can be a
   dynamically assigned home address that is linked to a mobile node's
   public permanent identifier (e.g., FQDN in DNS).  The mobile node
   requires strong location privacy, i.e., hiding only the mobility
   within an access network and revealing the access network prefix to
   the correspondent node is not acceptable.  An application on the
   correspondent node initiates a delay-sensitive session such VoIP by
   sending packets to the mobile node's public home address.  Initiating
   a session typically requires the correspondent node to already know
   the mobile node's identity.  The mobile node receives the packets in
   bi-directional tunneling mode from its home agent and may start
   sending packets back to the corresponding node.  Let's assume the
   mobile node and the correspondent node are located in the United
   States, whereas the mobile node's home agent is located in Europe.
   Since the mobile node is far away from home, the packet delay and
   hence the user experience is far from what could be achieved.

   However, if the mobile node uses route optimization mode, it reveals
   its CoA and hence its location to the correspondent node.  Note that
   the correspondent node can also be an attacker that just initiates a
   session to find out the mobile node's location.  Consequently, the
   mobile node has the choice: it can have good user experience without
   location privacy or location privacy with bad user experience.
   Currently, there is no way to achieve both simultaneously with Mobile
   IPv6.

   This document proposes a mechanism that can provide strong
   correspondent node-targeted location privacy and optimized routing
   simultaneously.  Home agent and correspondent node are unchanged and
   no new entities or messages are introduced.  The basic idea is that
   the mobile node uses a mobility service provided close to the
   correspondent node's domain.  More specifically, the mobile node
   bootstraps with a home agent (henceforth called the ORHA), which is
   located topologically close to the correspondent node and which is
   used for optimized communication with this correspondent node.  A
   location close to the correspondent node ensures that no location
   information is contained in the home address HoA_OR anchored at the
   ORHA while ensuring that the route via the ORHA is shorter (or at
   least not significantly longer) than the route via the IRHA in bi-
   directional tunneling mode.  For mobile node-initiated sessions, the
   mobile node uses the ORHA in bi-directional tunneling mode and HoA_OR
   on higher layers.  For correspondent node-initiated sessions, the
   public home address HoA_IR is used on higher layers and the mobile
   node registers the HoA_OR as care-of address at the correspondent
   node.

3.  Related work

   Qui et. al. [10] propose a solution to the correspondent node-
   targeted location privacy problem.  The basic idea is to hide the
   home address from the correspondent node in route optimization mode
   by using a pseudo home address instead of the real home address.
   Although the care-of address is revealed to the correspondent node,
   location privacy is protected by hiding the identity (i.e., real home
   address) of the mobile node from the correspondent node.  This
   approach has also been proposed in [9].  However, if the
   correspondent node initiates the communication, location privacy is
   usually compromised, since the real home address is already known by
   the correspondent node.  And even if the real home address can be
   hidden from the correspondent node, location privacy is compromised
   if the correspondent node is able to figure out the mobile node's
   identity by any other means on higher layers (e.g., during the
   conversation).

   [3] and [7] specify the mechanisms for Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping in
   the split and the integrated scenario, respectively.  They allow a
   mobile node to bootstrap with any home agent, for which the necessary
   trust relationships are in place.  When bootstrapping with a local
   home agent, optimized routing can be achieved in bi-directional
   tunneling mode.  However, since the home address obtained from a
   local home agent belongs to the network the mobile node is currently
   visiting, it contains location information.  Consequently, location
   privacy is compromised, if the correspondent node knows that the home
   agent is local to the mobile node.  Although in many cases the
   correspondent node will not know, there are cases where the
   correspondent node can find out whether the mobile node's home agent
   is local or remote.  For instance, a correspondent node may know that
   a mobile node's home agent is local because the mobile node's
   Mobility Service Provider (MSP) is known to always assign local home
   agents for routing efficiency reasons.

4.  Applicability Statement

   The mechanisms defined in this document require that the mobile node
   is able to utilize a mobility service, which is offered close to the
   correspondent node's domain.  To allow optimized communication with
   any correspondent node, it is required that home agent services are
   offered to the mobile node from various topological locations.  This
   typically requires that an MSP offers mobility service from many
   different locations or that multiple MSPs have some kind of roaming
   relationships with the mobile node's mobility service authorizer
   (MSA), so that a group of MSPs offers mobility service from many
   different locations.  Such roaming relationships can be based on an
   AAA infrastructure.

   This assumption is not particular to this document: the MIPv6
   bootstrapping solutions for the split scenario [3] and the integrated
   scenario [7] also require that a roaming relationship between MSP and
   MSA exist (see also [6]).  In the integrated scenario the access
   service authorizer (ASA) is also the mobility service authorizer
   (MSA).  An important point of the integrated scenario is that the
   access service provider (ASP) that the mobile node is currently
   visiting is typically also an MSP, which provides local home agent
   service.  This means that roaming relationships between many MSPs and
   the mobile node's MSA are required and, assuming global roaming, that
   home agent services must be offered to the mobile node from various
   topological locations.  This represents the requirements mentioned in
   the beginning of this section.  So the assumptions are basically not
   different from the assumptions for MIPv6 bootstrapping and can be met
   by re-using the home agents, roaming relationships, and the
   credentials that are already deployed for MIPv6 bootstrapping.

   Note that it is not required that the ORHA is located within the
   correspondent node's domain.  A domain nearby to the correspondent
   node's domain is sufficient to achieve location privacy and improved
   routing efficiency.  However, if the mobile node is not able to
   discover a home agent close to the correspondent node or if no
   roaming relationship to an MSP close to the correspondent node
   exists, simultaneous optimized routing and correspondent node-
   targeted location privacy cannot be provided by the mechanisms
   defined in this document.

   It is further assumed that the mobile node is authorized by the MSA
   to use ORHAs which are located close to the correspondent node and
   which potentially belong to an MSP different from the MSA.  Since
   location privacy can be seen as a value-added service, a user may be
   willing to pay for this service.  This may be an incentive for an MSA
   to offer this service and delegate the mobility management to an MSP
   located close to the correspondent node.

5.  Changes to Mobile Node Operation

   The mobile node operation is split in two cases: route optimization
   for new sessions (i.e., communication sessions that have not yet
   started) and route optimization for ongoing sessions.  A session is
   defined in this context by an application layer context bound to the
   IP addresses of the two endpoints, with one of the addresses being
   the mobile node's home address.  The first case applies, e.g., if the
   mobile nodes wants to initiate a session with a correspondent node
   and decides to optimized the route before sending the first data
   packets.  The second case applies, e.g., if the correspondent node
   initiates a session with the mobile node or if the mobile node
   decides to optimize the route of an ongoing session.

5.1.  Route Optimization for New Sessions

   The mobile node first tries to discover an ORHA (refer to Section 6
   for details about the ORHA discovery).  If the discovery is
   successful, the mobile node bootstraps with the ORHA and uses it in
   bi-directional tunneling mode for communication with the
   correspondent node.  Existing registrations with other home agents
   are kept for communication with other correspondent nodes.  The
   HoA_OR is not made public, i.e., no DNS update should be triggered
   for this home address.  Since no correspondent node registration is
   initiated, the care-of address is hidden and correspondent node-
   targeted location privacy is ensured.  An exemplary signaling flow is
   shown in Figure 1.

5.2.  Route Optimization for Ongoing Sessions

   After the mobile node has decided to optimize the route of a session
   (e.g., after receiving the first data packets tunneled by the IRHA
   and originated from the correspondent node), it discovers an ORHA and
   bootstraps with this ORHA.  Since the communication session is based
   on HoA_IR, packets are routed through the IRHA.  To achieve optimized
   routing, the mobile node uses route optimization mode over the
   reverse tunnel to the ORHA, i.e., care-of test messages, binding
   update messages, and later data packets destined for the
   correspondent node are sent over the reverse tunnel to the ORHA.
   While establishing the optimized path over the ORHA, the mobile node
   can send and receive data packets over the IRHA.

   To achieve location privacy, the mobile node uses HoA_IR as home
   address and HoA_OR as care-of address in the context of the route
   optimization mode.  This results in the following headers for packets
   sent by the mobile node for the session with the correspondent node
   (IPsec for signaling protection to ORHA assumed):


   Data packets and binding updates:

         IPv6 header (source = care-of address,
                      destination = ORHA)
         ESP header in tunnel mode
         IPv6 header (source = HoA_OR,
                      destination = correspondent node)
         Destination Options header
            Home Address option (HoA_IR)
         Any protocol




   Care-of Test Init:

         IPv6 header (source = care-of address,
                      destination = ORHA)
         ESP header in tunnel mode
         IPv6 header (source = HoA_OR,
                      destination = correspondent node)
         Any protocol


   Since from the correspondent node's point of view, HoA_OR is the
   care-of address and the HoA_IR is the home address of the mobile
   node, data packets sent by the correspondent node contain the HoA_IR

   in the routing header and the HoA_OR in the destination address field
   of the IP header.  Consequently, the data packets are intercepted by
   the ORHA and tunneled to the mobile node.  An exemplary signaling
   flow is shown in Figure 2.

   Location privacy is provided, since the correspondent node only
   learns HoA_OR and HoA_IR, which both do not contain any information
   about the mobile node's location.

   Note that upon changing the care-of address, the mobile node does not
   send binding updates to the correspondent node over the reverse
   tunnel to the ORHA, because the care-of address in this context is
   the HoA_OR.

5.3.  Route Optimization Mode Selection

   The mobile node has to decide for every correspondent node, whether
   it wants to use bi-directional tunneling mode, route optimization
   mode or the mechanisms described in this document.  How this decision
   is made and when the route optimization is triggered is out of scope
   of this document.  Generally, for non-delay-sensitive services such
   as simple web browsing, bi-directional tunneling to the home agent is
   sufficient and achieves strong correspondent node-targeted location
   privacy.  If no location privacy is required, Mobile IPv6 route
   optimization mode can be used.

   Since the number of simultaneous Mobile IPv6 sessions and the number
   of simultaneously used home agents have impacts on the overall
   signaling overhead and resource consumption on the mobile node, the
   mobile node should only use the mechanisms defined in this document
   for sessions that require simultaneous optimized routing and
   correspondent node-targeted location privacy.  Furthermore, the
   mobile node should be configured with a maximum number of
   simultaneously allowed Mobile IPv6 sessions.  However, not that we
   are currently not aware of any realistic scenario where a mobile node
   would have active sessions with tens of hundreds of different
   correspondent nodes simultaneously and all those sessions require
   simultaneous optimized routing and correspondent node-targeted
   location privacy.  Optimizations to improve scalability in such
   extreme scenarios may be developed later and are currently out of
   scope of this document.

5.4.  Source Address Selection

   Since the mobile node will typically use different home addresses for
   communication with different correspondent nodes when using the route
   optimization mechanisms defined in this document, the mobile node
   must be able to select the right home address as source address for
   packets to be sent to a specific destination address.  If the ORHA is
   located in the correspondent node's domain, the prefix of the home
   address anchored at the ORHA is similar to the prefix of the
   correspondent node and rule 8 of the default source address selection
   [5] applies.  For other cases, dynamically adding entries for HoA_OR
   and correspondent node address with matching labels in the policy
   table [5] when route optimization according is triggered would be an
   option to prefer a home address as source address for communication
   with a specific correspondent node.  However, since this is
   implementation specific, the details of the source address selection
   are out of the scope of this document.

6.  Location-dependent Home Agent Discovery

   The mechanisms defined in this document require the discovery or
   assignment of an ORHA, i.e., of a home agent located close to the
   correspondent node.  Two options are proposed in the following.

   The first option is to re-use the anycast-based or DNS-based home
   agent discovery specified in [3].  The mobile node would construct
   the anycast address or the FQDN based on the correspondent node's
   address, prefix or host name.  The DNS entry can be maintained by the
   MSP of the ORHA (e.g., "ORHA.CNdomain.com") or by the MN's MSA (e.g.,
   "CNdomain.ORHA.MSAdomain.com").  A detailed specification is
   currently out of scope.

   A second option is to query a dedicated server that is able to map an
   FQDN or address of a correspondent node to an FQDN or address of a
   home agent that is located in or topologically close to the
   correspondent node's domain.  This server can be provided by a third
   party in the public Internet or by the mobile node's mobility service
   authorizer.  The mobile node would query this server to discover the
   ORHA address.

   This option can be realized by re-using DHCP-based HA assignment with
   the options and mechanisms defined in [7] and [8].  During network
   authentication, the MSA would send to the Network Access Server (NAS)
   the home agent information for all the MSPs, which the mobile node is
   authorized to use.  To request a home agent close to the
   correspondent node, the mobile node would put the correspondent
   node's domain as target domain in the Home Network Identifier Option
   of a DHCP request message.  The id-type can be set to 2 or to a newly
   defined value for this purpose.  The NAS would then select a home
   agent from the set of authorized home agents that is in or close to
   the target domain specified in the Home Network Identifier Option.
   How this selection is done is out of scope of this document.  A
   simple selection algorithm would be to return a home agent with the
   domain name equal to the target domain, if such home agent is part of
   the list of authorized home agents, and otherwise return an home
   agent from the home MSP or an empty Home Network Information option.
   Finally, the NAS would assign the selected home agent to the mobile
   node by putting the corresponding information in the Home Network
   Information Option of the DHCP reply message.

   Since the ORHA learns the location of the mobile node, the mobile
   node must be sure that the ORHA doesn't reveal the mobile node's
   location to nodes not authorized to get this information, i.e., the
   ORHA must be trusted by the mobile node.  How the trust verification
   is done depends on the ORHA discovery mechanism in use.  One option
   is that the MSA knows which home agents are trusted with respect to

   location privacy and only assigns such home agents to the mobile node
   (i.e., only sends addresses of trusted home agents to the NAS or only
   maintains DNS entries for trusted home agents).  The MSA could also
   deny the authorization request if the MN tries to bootstrap with an
   untrusted home agent.  Another option is that the mobile node
   verifies the trust by itself, e.g., by pre-configuring a list of
   trusted home agent addresses on the mobile node or by using
   certificates.  The details of this verification are currently out of
   scope.

7.  Security Considerations

   An attacker could initiate many faked communication sessions by
   spoofing the source address in order to trigger the mobile node to
   discover and bootstrap with many home agents.  This could consume
   significant resources on the mobile node and in the network and may
   cause a DoS.  As a countermeasure, the mobile node should not start
   bootstrapping automatically without further checks when the
   correspondent node initiates a session or it should limit the number
   of ORHAs it is registered with.  Faked sessions should be identified
   as such as quickly as possible and the mobile node should de-register
   immediately from ORHAs that only serve faked sessions.

   The ORHA knows the location of the mobile node and could distribute
   it to third parties without authorization from the mobile node.
   Hence, the mobile node must be sure that the ORHA is trusted before
   the mobile node reveals its location to the ORHA.  How this can be
   done is detailed in Section 6.  Note that the fact that the ORHA and
   the correspondent node may be in the same administrative domain
   doesn't imply that the ORHA reveals the mobile node's location to the
   correspondent node.  This is also true in today's cellular networks,
   where it is ensured that users of a service provided by a particular
   mobile operator don't know the location of other users using a
   service provided by the same operator.

   The return routability procedure over the reverse tunnel to the ORHA
   is not considered less secure than the standard return routability
   procedure as long as the ORHA is trusted and the ORHA link is not
   vulnerable to eavesdropping.

   This document is concerned with correspondent node-targeted location
   privacy only.  Eavesdropper-targeted location privacy and any
   location privacy issue not directly related to Mobile IPv6 are out of
   the scope of this document.
