Internet Drafts          Resource Priority AVPs             July 8, 2010


Abstract

   This document  defines  Attribute-Value  Pair  (AVP)  containers  for
   various  priority  parameters  for  use  with  Diameter  and  the AAA
   framework.   The  parameters  themselves  are  defined   in   several
   different protocols that operate at either the network or application
   layer.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a number of Attribute-Value  Pairs  (AVP)  that
   can  be  used  within  the  Diameter  protocol  [RFC3588] to convey a
   specific set of priority parameters.  These parameters are  specified
   in   other   documents,   but   are  briefly  described  below.   The
   corresponding AVPs defined in Section 3 are an extension to to  those
   defined in [RFC5866].

   Priority influences the distribution of  resources.   This  influence
   may  be  probabilistic,  ranging  between  (but not including) 0% and
   100%, or it may be in the form of a guarantee to  either  receive  or
   not receive the resource.

   The influence attributed to prioritization may also affect  QoS,  but
   it  is not to be confused with QoS.  As an example, if packets of two
   or  more  flows  are  contending  for  the  same  shared   resources,
   prioritization  helps  determine  which packet receives the resource.
   However, this allocation of resource does not correlate  directly  to
   any  specific delay or loss bounds that have been associated with the
   packet.

   Another example of how prioritization can be realized is  articulated
   in  Appendix  A.3  (the  priority  by-pass model) of [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-
   emergency-rsvp].  In this case, prioritized flows may gain access  to
   resources that are never shared with non-prioritized flows.


2.  Terminology and Abbreviations

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",  "SHALL  NOT",
   "SHOULD",  "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Priority Parameter Encoding

   This section defines a set of priority AVPs.  This  set  is  for  use
   with   the  DIAMETER  QoS  application  [RFC5866]  and  represents  a
   continuation of the list of AVPs defined in  [RFC5624].   The  syntax

   notation used is that of [RFC3588].

   3.1.  Dual-Priority AVP


   The Dual-Priority AVP is a grouped AVP consisting of  two  AVPs;  the
   Preemption-Priority  and  the Defending-Priority AVP.  These AVPs are
   derived from the  corresponding  priority  fields  specified  in  the
   Signaled   Preemption  Priority  Policy  Element  [RFC3181]  of  RSVP
   [RFC2205].  The Defending-Priority is set when  the  reservation  has
   been   admitted.    The  Preemption-Priority  of  a  newly  requested
   reservation is compared with the Defending Priority of  a  previously
   admitted  flow.   The  actions  taken  based  upon the result of this
   comparison are a function of local policy.

     Dual-Priority  ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                 { Preemption-Priority }
                 { Defending-Priority }


3.1.1.  Preemption-Priority AVP

   The Preemption-Priority AVP (AVP Code TBD)  is  of  type  Unsigned32.
   Higher  values  represent higher priority.  The value encoded in this
   AVP is the same as  the  preemption  priority  value  that  would  be
   encoded in the signaled preemption priority policy element.

3.1.2.  Defending-Priority AVP

   The Defending-Priority AVP (AVP Code  TBD)  is  of  type  Unsigned32.
   Higher  values  represent higher priority.  The value encoded in this
   AVP is the same as the defending priority value that would be encoded
   in the signaled preemption priority policy element.


3.2.  Admission-Priority AVP

   The Admission-Priority AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.  The
   admission priority of the flow is used to increase the probability of
   session establishment for selected flows.   Higher  values  represent
   higher  priority.   A  given  admission  priority  is encoded in this
   information element using the same  value  as  when  encoded  in  the
   admission  priority  parameter  defined  in Section 5.1 of [I-D.ietf-
   tsvwg-emergency-rsvp].

3.3. SIP-Resource-Priority AVP

   The SIP-Resource-Priority AVP is a  grouped  AVP  consisting  of  two

   AVPs,   the  SIP-Resource-Priority-Namespace  and  the  SIP-Resource-
   Priority-Value AVP, which are derived from the corresponding optional
   header  fields  in  [rfc4412].   The  SIP-Resource-Priority-Namespace
   identifies a particular ordered set of  priority  values.   The  SIP-
   Resource-Priority-Value  identifies  a specific priority value within
   the set identified by the SIP-Resource-Priority-Namespace.

     SIP-Resource-Priority ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                     { SIP-Resource-Priority-Namespace }
                     { SIP-Resource-Priority-Value }

3.3.1.  SIP-Namespace AVP

   The SIP-Resource-Priority-Namespace AVP (AVP Code  TBD)  is  of  type
   UTF8String.

3.3.2 SIP-Resource-Priority-Value AVP

   The  SIP-Resource-Priority-Value  AVP  (AVP  Code  TBD)  is  of  type
   UTF8String.

3.4.  Application-Level-Resource-Priority AVP

   The Application-Level-Resource-Priority (ALRP) AVP is a  grouped  AVP
   consisting  of  two  AVPs,  the ALRP-Namespace AVP and the ALRP-Value
   AVP.

   A description of the semantics of the parameter values can  be  found
   in  [RFC4412]  and  in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-emergency-rsvp].  The registry
   set up by [RFC4412] provided string  values  for  both  the  priority
   namespace  and  the  priority  values associated with that namespace.
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-emergency-rsvp]  modifies  that  registry  to  assign
   numerical  values  to both the namespace identifiers and the priority
   values   within   them.   Consequently,   SIP-Resource-Priority   and
   Application-Level-Resource-Priority  AVPs  convey  the  same priority
   semantics, but with differing syntax. The coding for parameters is as
   follows:

   Eventhough [RFC4412] and [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-emergency-rsvp] refer to the
   same  information  (ie, namespace and value), the actual encodings of
   each are defined in different forms.  In the former case,  an  alpha-
   numeric  encoding  is  used  while  the  latter  is  constrained to a
   numeric-only value.  This difference  is  reflected  in  the  in  the
   defined structures of Section 3.3 and 3.4 of this document.

     Application-Level-Resource-Priority  ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                                     { ALRP-Namespace }
                                     { ALRP-Value }

3.4.1.  ALRP-Namespace AVP

   The ALRP-Namespace AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.

3.4.2.  ALRP-Value AVP

   The ALRP-Priority AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned32.


4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  AVP Codes

   IANA is requested to allocate AVP codes for the following  AVPs  that
   are defined in this document.

    |SIP-Value                              TBD  3.3.2     UTF8String  |
    |Application-Level-Resource-Priority    TBD  3.4       Grouped     |
    |ALRP-Namespace                         TBD  3.4.1     Unsigned32  |
    |ALRP-Value                             TBD  3.4.2     Unsigned32  |
    +------------------------------------------------------------------+

4.2.  QoS Profile

   IANA is requested to allocate a new value  from  the  Authentication,
   Authorization,  and  Accounting (AAA) Parameters/QoS Profile registry
   defined in [RFC5624] for the QoS profile defined  in  this  document.
   The  name  of  the  profile  is  "Resource  priority parameters". The
   reference is [RFCXXXX] (this document).


5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes  the  extension  of  Diameter  for  conveying
   Quality  of  Service information.  The security considerations of the
   Diameter protocol itself have been discussed in RFC  3588  [RFC3588].
   Use of the AVPs defined in this document MUST take into consideration
   the security issues and requirements of the Diameter base protocol.
