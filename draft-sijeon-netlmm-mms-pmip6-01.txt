Internet-Draft    Mobile Multicasting Support in PMIPv6       March 2009


Abstract

   To support IP-based group mobile communication, such as mobile IPTV,
   IP multicasting is required. Two major constraints in mobile
   multicasting are the tunnel convergence problem and high handover
   latency. To reduce the constraints, several mobile multicasting
   schemes based on Mobile IP have been proposed. To meet requirements,
   we present a multicasting architecture and fast handover scheme for
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).

Internet-Draft    Mobile Multicasting Support in PMIPv6       March 2009


1. Introduction

   High performance of wireless technologies enable multimedia streaming
   service such as IPTV audio/video stream. Since these services are
   based on group communication, IP multicasting is also required.
   Traditional IP multicast mechanisms, including multicast routing and
   membership management protocols, have been designed for static hosts
   [2]. Moreover, up to now, IP mobility protocols for mobile
   multicasting depended on host-based Mobile IP variants (Mobile IP and
   Fast Mobile IPv6). However, Mobile IP variant protocols require
   modifications to a applied solution on mobile devices and IP
   reconfiguration during handoff. The Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) in [3]
   does not require any mobility related protocol and IP reconfiguration
   in the same PMIPv6 domain. With the strength of PMIPv6, several
   service solutions are described in [4]. However, the solution needs
   to solve two major constraints which are the tunnel convergence
   problem and high handover latency [5]. Thus, we present a
   multicasting architecture and fast handover operation considering the
   requirements for PMIPv6.

           Figure 1: Multicasting architecture in PMIPv6 domain


   To design PMIPv6-based multicasting services, we should consider the
   position of the multicast router (MR). If a LMA contains the MR
   function, it introduces a tunnel convergence problem similar to
   Mobile IP variant bi-directional tunnel schemes. To solve the
   problem, we separate the MR function from the LMA. Moreover, if a MAG
   has a MR function and a local MR is connected with MAGs, the routing
   update overhead degrades the performance of PMIPv6 components due to
   frequent MNs' movement. Thus, Figure 1 shows the proposed PMIPv6
   multicasting architecture where the MAG only contains a MLD
   forwarding proxy function using the IGMP/MLD forwarding proxy [6]

   problem and reduce the routing processing overhead.

           Figure 2: Fast multicast handover procedure using PMIPv6

   Directly applying a PMIPv6 handover scheme to the proposed network
   model leads to service disruption due to the latency cased by MLD
   query/report. To solve this problem, we propose a fast handover
   scheme using the context transfer mechanism. Figure 2 shows handover
   operation. When a MN hands off, the MAG with MLD forwarding proxy
   predicts an MN's movement direction and transfers the multicast
   context message, which includes the MN ID, the MN home network

   prefix, the current MAG address, and the multicast group address.
   Then, the N-MAG checks whether it is a receiving node of multicast
   data corresponding to the group requested by the P-MAG. If this is
   not the case, it joins the group by sending a MLD report.

7. Security Considerations

   This document does not discuss any special security concerns in
   detail.  The protocol of this document is built on the assumption
   that all participating nodes are trusted each other as well as there
