Abstract 
 
   This document defines a conference floor event package for Session 
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) conferences that require floor control. The 
   conference floor event package allows users to subscribe to a 
   conference floor server URIs. Notifications are sent about changes in 
   the floor state of the conference and optionally about changes in the 
   state of additional floor components of the conference. Subscriptions 
   and notifications of conference floor are supported by an event 
   package within the general SIP event notification framework.

1. Introduction 
 
   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1] conference package [3] 
   defines an event package for SIP conferences providing the conference 
   notification service as outlined in the SIP conferencing framework 
   [4].  
         
   Here, we define conference floor event package for SIP conferences, 
   which support conference floor event followed the rule defined in 
   RFC3265, the general event notification framework of SIP [2].   
         
   This document aims at providing state information of floor control of 
   a conference to its participants, no matter which participant 
   supports specific floor control protocol or not. As long as a 
   participant supports SIP conference floor event, even though it does 
   not include a specific floor control protocol such as BFCP [5], it 
   can get the changes of floor state of the conference it joins by 
   subscribing the event.  
         
   The conference floor server URI acts as the notifier, and provides 
   clients with updates on conference floor state.  
         
   Another possible scenario to get floor event information is that 
   conference participants subscribe to the conference server, called 
   focus [4], and the conference server requests the floor information 
   to the floor control server and acts as the notifier. Focus and floor 
   control server are logical entities, and communication between the 
   focus and floor control server is out of the scope of the document.   
         
   This document is intended to continue a discussion to explore 
   standard operations for conference floor event package. Please send 
   comments to the mailing list <sipping@ietf.org> or <xcon@ietf.org>

                      Floor State Event Package         February 2005 
 
   Floor control 
       A mechanism that enables applications or users to gain safe and 
       mutually exclusive or non-exclusive input access to the shared 
       object or resource.  
         
   Floor control server  
       A logical entity that maintains the state of the floor(s) 
       including which floors exists, who the floor chairs are, who 
       holds a floor, etc. Requests to manipulate a floor are directed 
       at the floor control server. 
    
 
 
4. Background and Requirements 
        
   Floor control is one of the needed functionalities for multi-party 
   conferences in which more than one speaker are participated. XCON WG 
   is working on providing floor control functions for centralized 
   conference, and builds a specific protocol named BFCP [5] and defines 
   essential operations for floor control, so that a UA are able to 
   request, be granted, release, and be withdrawn a floor by the 
   protocol. It is also possible a participant in the conference who 
   uses a BFCP get the information of the floor state by the protocol. 
    
   There are, however, not every UA may have the specific floor control 
   protocol, and sometimes it is okay to join the conference without the 
   floor control protocol when it only want to be an audience which does 
   not need to request floors in the conference. Especially, when one 
   joins to a conference with a mobile wireless device which has lack of 
   resources and bandwidth, it might not have enough resources to equip 
   all the needed protocol. However, the audiences may still want to 
   have the knowledge of the floors to understand what is going on in 
   the conference such as who is talking now.  
    
   In other hand, some participants want to get more specified floor 
   state information than what the floor control protocol provides, 
   although it uses the floor control protocol for obtaining and 
   releasing the floors. Currently, all the changes about a requested 
   floor are provided by request-answer mode in the BFCP. However, 
   someone may want to get only 'granted' floor information rather than 
   to get all the changes of the floor state, someone may want to only 5 
   recent issued floor information, or someone may want to get only 
   audio floors information. Otherwise, someone may want to manipulate 
   the time period when it receives the requesting floor information.  
    
   To meet these requirements, this draft defines a floor state event 
   package for SIP based conference aware UAs [4]. This event package 
   can be used for such participants. Those who do not have the specific 
   floor control protocol can get the floor state information by 
   subscribing the floor state event. The floor state event package

                      Floor State Event Package         February 2005 
 
   includes event throttling and event filtering, so that it also 
   satisfies those who want to richer information of the floors of the 
   conference. 
 
    
    
5. Conference Floor Event Package 
 
   RFC3265 defining the general event notification framework of SIP [2] 
   provides an extension to SIP [1] for events. This document is for 
   specifying conference floor event. The general information required 
   for SIP event package is following RFC3265.  
         
   Conference aware SIP clients subscribe to the floor control server 
   represented by URIs. The floor control server has all state 
   information for floors in the conference [5], and it notifies the 
   floor state to the subscribed participants.   
    
       NOTE: Another possible scenario to get floor event information 
       is that conference participants subscribe to the conference 
       server, called focus [4], and the conference server requests the 
       floor information to the floor control server and acts as the 
       notifier. In this case, the floor event information can be 
       merged into the conference event package. We need to discuss 
       more if it is needed to be merged into the conference event 
       package. 
         
 
5.1 Event Package Name 
 
   The name of the conference floor control event package is "floor". 
   This value appears in the Event and Allow-Events header, as described 
   in RFC3265.  
         
   Example of usage:  
         
   Event: floor 
  
 
5.2 Subscriber Generating a SUBSCRIBE Request 
    
5.2.1 SUBSCRIBE Bodies 
    
   A SUBSCRIBE for a conference floor package MAY contain a body. The 
   body can contain specific type of floor. In addition, the body can 
   specify the rules for event throttling or/and event filtering, such 
   as when a notification should be sent to, or what types of 
   information should be contain in the notification.  
    

 
 
E.Kim                   Expires - August 2005                [Page 5] 
                      Floor State Event Package         February 2005 
 
   The specified rule can be changed during a dialog by re-issuing a new 
   SUBSCRIBE message. If a SUBSCRIBE within a dialog does not contain a 
   filtering rule, it implies to apply the existing filtering rule.  
    
   To support event filtering, all subscribers and notifiers SHOULD 
   support the "application/floor-filter+xml" data format.  
    
   The subscribe request MUST contain an Accept header field, if the 
   body includes the filter, and the value MUST be "application/floor-
   filter+xml", and MAY include any other types capable of representing 
   dialog state. 
         
   A SUBSCRIBE for a conference floor package MAY be sent without a body. 
   This implies the default subscription filtering policy. By the 
   default policy, notifications are generated whenever if there is any 
   change in the state of the floors in the conference. Notifications 
   normally contain partial state that has changed. The exception is a 
   NOTIFY sent in response to a SUBSCRIBE. These NOTIFYs contain the 
   full state of the information requested by the subscriber. 
 
5.2.2 Event Filtering  
 
   The floor state changes MAY occur quite often when multiple speakers 
   try to get the floor in a very aggressive conversation. The audience 
   MAY not want to get all the changes of the event, and only want to 
   get essential changes among them such as floor "granted", or only 
   want to get the most recent 5 changes. Sometimes, subscribers MAY 
   want to get only "audio" floor information, ignoring video or 
   whiteboard floor event changes which are simply recognizable via 
   application. 
    
   Multiple filters MAY be included in one SUBSCRIBE message, as 
   required.  
    
   To filter floor event information, the body has the root element of 
   "floor-filters". The element is consisted of one or more "filter" 
   elements, which describes specific rules for notification.  
    
   The "filter" has a mandatory attribute "id", and includes an optional 
   "floor-info" sub-element and an optional "floor-number" sub-element.  
    
   The "floor-info" sub-element is used for applying the filter by 
   specific floor state information. The sub-element has an optional 
   "floor-id" sub-element and an optional "resource" sub-element and an 
   optional "state" sub-element. The "resource" sub-element indicates 
   audio, video, whiteboard, or other resources. The "state" sub-element 
   has the value of "requested", "granted", "accepted", "released", and 
   "withdrawn".

                      Floor State Event Package         February 2005 
 
   The "floor-number" sub-element is used for specifying the specific 
   number of floor events.  
    
   Each filter is defined by "include" or "exclude".  
 
5.2.3 Filtering examples 
 
   If a subscriber want to get a recent 5 event changes via the 
   responding notification, the SUBSCRIBE body contains the following 
   information. 
    
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
   <floor-filters xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:floor-filter"> 
      <filter id="100"> 
        <include> 
           <filter-number = 5> 
        </include> 
      </filter> 
   </floor-filters> 
    
   If a subscriber want to get only "granted" "audio" information, but 
   want to exclude a specific floor-id, the SUBSCRIBE body contains the 
   following information. 
    
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
   <floor-filters xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:floor-filter"> 
      <filter id="200"> 
        <include> 
           <filter-info> 
              <resource = "audio"> 
              <state = "granted"> 
           </filter-info> 
        </include> 
      </filter> 
      <filter id="201"> 
        <exclude> 
           <filter-info> 
              <floor-id = "1"> 
           </filter-info> 
        </exclude> 
      </filter> 
   </floor-filters> 
    
    
5.3 Duration of the subscription 
 
   The duration of this subscription is following the rule of the 
   conference event package [3].

5.4 Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests 
    
5.4.1 Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests 
 
   The conference floors information contains sensitive information as 
   the conference information [4]. When a conference URI acts as a 
   notifier, it treats the floors information as the same policy with 
   the conference information. When a floor control server acts as a 
   notifter of this event, the authorization policy should be made. In 
   a basic recommendation policy, all subscriptions SHOULD be 
   authenticated and then authorized before approval. 
    
   If the SUBSCRIBE message includes filter with the data format of  
   "application/floor-filter+xml", and if the notifier is able to 
   interpret the filter, it MUST generate the notifications by the 
   request. If it cannot support the filter, it MUST send an error 
   message.  
    
5.4.2 Notify bodies 
 
   As described in RFC 3265 [2], the NOTIFY message will contain bodies 
   that describe the state of the subscribed resource. This body is in 
   a format listed in the Accept header field of the SUBSCRIBE, or a 
   package-specific default if the Accept header field was omitted from 
   the SUBSCRIBE. 
    
   In this event package, the body of the notification contains floors 
   document. This document describes the state of floors of a 
   conference. All subscribers and notifiers MUST support the   
   "application/floor-info+xml" data format described in Section 4. 
    
   The subscribe request MAY contain an Accept header field. If no such 
   header field is present, it has a default value of 
   "application/floor-info+xml". If the header field is present, it 
   MUST include "application/floor-info+xml", and MAY include any other 
   types capable of representing dialog state.  
 
5.4.3 Generation rule of NOTIFY Requests  
    
   Notifications SHOULD be generated for the conference every time when 
   a change is made in the state in any of the information delivered to 
   the subscriber. 
    
   The changes generally occur when a floor is requested, accepted, 
   granted, released, or withdrawn to a participant, and when a floor 
   holder is changed.  
 
   When the notifier receives a SUBSCRIBE with filtering or event 
   throttling rule, notification SHOULD be generated for the conference 

 
 
E.Kim                   Expires - August 2005                [Page 8] 
                      Floor State Event Package         February 2005 
 
   every time when the specified rule requested by the subscriber is 
   satisfied.  
    
   The notifier incorporate, re-apply, or remove when it receives new 
   SUBSCRIBE message with new rule to be added, modified, or removed 
   from the existing rule.   
    
 
5.5 Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests 
 
   The NOTIFY for the conference floor event package will only contain 
   information about those floors of which state has changed. To 
   construct a coherent view of the total state of all floors, a 
   subscriber to the event package will need to combine NOTIFYs 
   received over time.  
    
   If the NOTIFY indicates that a subscription has been terminated, the 
   subscription is assumed to be terminated. The basic rule for events 
   handling is applied as the RFC3265 [2] states. 
 
 
5.6 Handling of Forked Requests 
 
   The conference floors are handled in centralized way. Thus, 
   SUBSCRIBE requests for this event should normally not be forked. 
    
 
5.7 Rate of Notification 
 
   RFC 3265 [2] requires each package to specify the maximum rate at 
   which notifications can be sent. With consideration of the 
   congestion control, it is RECOMMENDED that the server not generate 
   notifications for a single subscriber at a rate faster than once 
   every 5 seconds, applying the same rule with the conference event 
   package [4]. 
    
   If the SUBSCRIBE contain any specified rule for the duration, it 
   follows the rule. 
    
    
    
6. Data format of the Floor state information 
 
   XML document is used for the conference floor information. It MUST 
   be well-formed and SHOULD be valid. The document SHOULD be based on 
   XML 1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8. The namespace URI for 
   elements defined by this specification is a URN [6], using the 
   namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [7] and extended by [8]. This 
   URN is:

       urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:floor-info  
    
   A conference floor information document begins with the root element 
   tag "floor-info". 
    
 
6.1 Floor Information 
 
   Floor information has the root element "floors-info". This element 
   has an attribute, "conf-uri". The attribute is the identifier of the 
   conference in which the floors are exchanged. The root element also 
   has zero or more "floor-info" sub-element.  
         
   The "floor-info" has one mandatory attribute, "floor-id". It is the 
   identifier of a floor. If SDP or BFCP assigns a floor-id for a 
   resource, this value is matched with the value.  
         
   The "floor-info" has one "resource" sub-element, which identifies 
   the type (audio, video) or codec of the floor resource. It has zero 
   or more "chairs" sub-element that gives the information of chairs 
   who take charge of the floor. It has "state" sub-element that 
   explains current status of the floor, such as the floor is granted, 
   released, etc. 
    
6.1.1 Resource element 
 
   The resource element specifies the resource name matched with the 
   floor. Generally it will be the same with the media name appeared in 
   the m lines of SDP. 
 
6.1.2 Chairs element 
 
   The chairs element has zero or more chair element which is describing 
   the URIs of the chair. More than one chair can take charge of a floor. 
   If this element is used, it SHOULD show the all members of the chair 
   for the floor. 
 
6.1.3 State element 
 
   The state element shows the current state of the floor, and the time 
   information about the floor. It has a "floorstate" element,which has 
   a mendatory "transaction" attribute identifying the floor request. 
   The "floorstate" element also has one or more "users" sub-element, 
   one or more "floor-action" sub-element, zero or more "action-time" 
   sub-element and "expiration" sub-element.   
         
   The "users" element has one or more user element which is identified 
   by URIs. The user element is used for reporting the participants who 
   currently make an action about the floor.  
         
 
 
E.Kim                   Expires - August 2005               [Page 10] 
                      Floor State Event Package         February 2005 
 
   The "floor-action" element is for the state of the floor related any 
   action taken for the floor. It has the value of "requested," 
   "accepted," "granted," "released," or "withdrawn".  The following 
   explains the usage of the values.  
         
    
   requested: The floor is requested.    
        
   accepted: The requested floor is accepted by floor server.    
        
   granted: The requested floor is granted by floor server. In an 
            internal operation, floor server sends the request to the 
            floor chair(s), and the request is admitted by the floor 
            chair(s). The specific functional behavior is out of the 
            scope of this document and it will be performed by a floor 
            control protocol.  
         
   released: The floor holder releases the floor.  
         
   withdrawn: The floor which has been holding by someone is enforced to 
            be taken back by some reason. The reason will be dependant 
            on the policy of a floor control protocol.  
         
         
   The "action-time" element notifies the time when the floor operation 
   is made.  
         
   The "expiration" is for the time information for the floor, 
   especially notifies the expiration time.

8. Security Considerations 
    
   Conference floor information is very sensitive information, so that 
   the server MUST use appropriate authentication to ensure the commands 
   to manipulate or interact the data originated from trusted parties. 
   Other SIP considerations apply. The further concerned security issues 
   will be identified as the further works go on.
