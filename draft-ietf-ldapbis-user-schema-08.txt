Abstract

   This document is a integral part of the Lightweight Directory Access 
   Protocol (LDAP) technical specification [ROADMAP].  It provides a 
   technical specification of attribute types and object classes 
   intended for use by LDAP directory clients for many directory 
   services, such as, White Pages.  These objects are widely used as a 
   basis for the schema in many LDAP directories.  This document does 
   not cover attributes used for the administration of directory 
   servers, nor does it include directory objects defined for specific 
   uses in other documents.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides an overview of attribute types and object 
   classes intended for use by Lightweight Directory Access Protocol 
   directory clients for many directory services, such as, White Pages.
   Originally specified in the X.500 [X.500] documents, these objects 
   are widely used as a basis for the schema in many LDAP directories.
   This document does not cover attributes used for the administration 
   of directory servers, nor does it include directory objects defined 
   for specific uses in other documents.

1.1  Situation

   This document is a integral part of the LDAP technical specification 
   [ROADMAP] which obsoletes the previously defined LDAP technical 
   specification [RFC3377] in its entirety.  In terms of RFC 2256, 
   Sections 6 and 8 of RFC 2256 are obsoleted by [Syntaxes].  Sections 
   5.1, 5.2, 7.1 and 7.2 of RFC 2256 are obsoleted by [Models].  The 
   remainder of RFC 2256 is obsoleted by this document.  Section 2.4 of 
   this document supercedes the technical specification for the 'dc' 
   attribute type found in RFC 2247.  The remainder of RFC 2247 remains 
   in force.

   This document updates RFC 2798 by replacing the informative 
   description of the 'uid' attribute type, with the definitive 
   description provided in Section 2.39 of this document.

   A number of schema elements which were included in the previous 
   revision of the LDAP Technical Specification are not included in this
   revision of LDAP.  PKI-related schema elements are now specified in 
   [LDAP-CERT] and [LDAP-CRL].  Unless reintroduced in future technical 
   specifications, the remainder are to be considered Historic.

1.2  Conventions


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.3  General Issues

   This document references Syntaxes given in Section 3 of [Syntaxes] 
   and Matching Rules specified in Section 4 of [Syntaxes].

   The definitions of Attribute Types and Object Classes are written 
   using the ABNF form of AttributeTypeDescription and 
   ObjectClassDescription given in [Models].  Lines have been folded 
   for readability.

1.4  Source

   The schema definitions in this document are based on those found in 
   the X.500-series [X.520] and [X.521], RFC 2798 [RFC2798] and 
   RFC 2247 [RFC2247], specifically:
   
      Sections             Source
      ============         ==================
      2.1 - 2.3            X.520 [X.520]
      2.4                  RFC 2247 [RFC2247]
      2.5 - 2.38           X.520 [X.520]
      2.39                 RFC 2798 [2798]
      2.40 - 2.43          X.520 [X.520]
      3.1  - 3.12          X.521 [X.521]



   However, the descriptions in this document SHALL be considered 
   definitive for use in LDAP.


2.  Attribute Types

   The Attribute Types contained in this section hold user information.

   There is no requirement that servers implement the following 
   attribute types: 

      searchGuide
      teletexTerminalIdentifier

   In fact, their use is greatly discouraged.

   An LDAP server implementation SHOULD recognize the rest of the 
   attribute types described in this section.



2.1  businessCategory

   The businessCategory attribute type describes the kinds of business 
   performed by an organization (e.g., "banking", "transportation").  
   Each kind is one value of this multi-valued attribute.

   ( 2.5.4.15 NAME 'businessCategory' 
      EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
      SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 ) 

   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 refers to the Directory String 
   syntax [Syntaxes].

INTERNET-DRAFT     draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-08           July 2004


2.2  c

   The c (countryName) attribute type contains a two-letter ISO 3166 
   [ISO3166] country code (e.g., "DE").  (Source:  X.520)

   ( 2.5.4.6 NAME 'c' 
      SUP name 
      SINGLE-VALUE )

2.3  cn

   The cn (commonName) attribute type contains names of an object 
   (e.g., "Martin K Smith", "Marty Smith", "printer12").  Each name is 
   one value of this multi-valued attribute.  If the object corresponds 
   to a person, it is typically the person's full name.  
   (Source:  X.520)

   ( 2.5.4.3 NAME 'cn' 
      SUP name )

2.4  dc

   The dc (short for domainComponent) attribute type is a string 
   holding one component, a <label> [RFC1034}, of a DNS domain name 
   (e.g., "example" or "com", but not "example.com").  The encoding of 
   IA5String for use in LDAP is simply the characters of the string 
   itself.  The equality matching rule is case insensitive, as is 
   today's DNS.

   ( 0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.25 NAME 'dc' 
      EQUALITY caseIgnoreIA5Match
      SUBSTR caseIgnoreIA5SubstringsMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26 
      SINGLE-VALUE )

   1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26 refers to the IA5 String 
   syntax [Syntaxes].

   It is noted that the directory will not ensure that values of this 
   attribute conform to the label production [RFC1034].  It is the 
   application responsibility to ensure domains it stores in this 
   attribute are appropriately represented.

   It is also noted that applications supporting Internationalized 
   Domain Names SHALL use the ToASCII method [RFC3490] to produce 
   <label> components of the <domain> production.

2.5  description

   The description attribute type contains human-readable descriptive 
   phrases about the object (e.g., "a color printer", "Maintenance is

5.  Security Considerations

   Attributes of directory entries are used to provide descriptive 
   information about the real-world objects they represent, which can be
   people, organizations or devices.  Most countries have privacy laws 
   regarding the publication of information about people.

   Transfer of cleartext passwords is strongly discouraged where the 
   underlying transport service cannot guarantee confidentiality and may
   result in disclosure of the password to unauthorized parties.

   Multiple attribute values for the userPassword needs to be used with 
   care. Especially reset/deletion of a password by an admin without 
   knowing the old user password gets tricky or impossible if multiple 
   values for different applications are present. 

   Certainly, applications which intend to replace the userPassword 
   value(s) with new value(s) should use modify/replaceValues (or 
   modify/deleteAttribute+addAttribute).  Additionally, server 



Dally                   Expires  January 2005                  [Page 23]
INTERNET-DRAFT     draft-ietf-ldapbis-user-schema-08           July 2004


   implementations are encouraged to provide administrative controls 
   which, if enabled, restrict the userPassword attributer to one value.

   Note that when used for authentication purposes [AuthMeth], the user 
   need only prove knowledge of one of the values, not all of 
   the values.

   The uid attribute type definition in this document supercedes the 
   specification of the userid in RFC 1274 by P. Barker and S. Kille
