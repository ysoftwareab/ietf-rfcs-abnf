1.  Introduction

   Virtual Subnet [I-D.ietf-bess-virtual-subnet] is a BGP/MPLS IP VPN
   [RFC4364] -based subnet extension solution which is intended for
   building Layer3 network virtualization overlays within and/or across
   data centers.  In the Virtual Subnet context, since CE host routes of
   a given VPN instance need to be exchanged among PE routers
   participating in that VPN instance, the resulting routing table size
   of PE routers may become a big concern, especially in large-scale
   data center environment where they may need to install a huge amount
   of host routes into their routing tables.

   [I-D.ietf-bess-virtual-subnet-fib-reduction] describes a method to
   reduce the FIB size of PE routers without any change to the RIB and
   the routing table.  This FIB reduction approach is applicable in the
   case where the control plane of PE routers still needs to maintain
   all host routes of the attached VPN instances for some reason (e.g.,
   to support multicast VPN service).  In the case where the control
   plane of PE routers doesn't need to maintain all host routes of the
   attached VPN instances, the RIB size of PE routers can be reduced as
   well which would be beneficial for CPU and memory resource saving
   purpose.  This document proposes a very simple RIB reduction
   mechanism.  The basic idea of this mechanism is: remote host routes

   are learnt by PE routers on demand by using the L3VPN Address Prefix
   ORF as described in [I-D.xu-bess-l3vpn-prefix-orf].

                      Figure 1: RIB Reduction Example

   To reduce the RIB size of PE routers in the Virtual Subnet context,
   the L3VPN Address Prefix ORF mechanism is used to realize on-demand

   route announcement.  Take the VPN instance as shown in Figure 1 as an
   example, the RIB reduction procedures are described as follows:

   1.  PE routers as RR clients advertise host routes for their local CE
       hosts to the RR by using Rout Target (RT) ORF [RFC4364] (i.e.,
       the RR is configured to advertise route refresh messages
       containing a RT-ORF entry corresponding to that VPN instance) or
       Route Target (RT) Constrain [RFC4684] (i.e., the RR is configured
       to advertise update messages containing RT membership information
       corresponding to that VPN instance).  Those PE routers belonging
       to that VPN instance which don't want to receive remote CE host
       routes of that VPN instance would notify the RR not to advertise
       any host route to them by using the L3VPN Address Prefix ORF
       mechanism (i.e., only requesting L3VPN routes with prefix length
       less than 32 (in the VPNv4 case) or 128 (in the VPNv6 case)).

   2.  Meanwhile, the RR is configured with static routes for more
       specific subnets (e.g., 10.1.1.0/25 and 10.1.1.128/25)
       corresponding to the extended subnet (e.g., 10.1.1.0/24) with
       next-hop being pointed to Null0 and then redistributes these
       routes to BGP.  In the case where the RR is not available for
       transferring L3VPN traffic between PE routers for some reason
       (e.g., the RR is running on a server), a particular PE router
       other than the RR could be selected to advertise the above more
       specific subnet routes as long as that PE router has learnt all
       remote host routes belonging to that VPN instance.

   3.  Upon receiving a packet destined for a remote CE host from a
       local CE host, if there is no host route for that remote CE host
       in the FIB, the ingress PE router will forward the packet to the
       RR according to the longest-matching subnet routes learnt from
       the RR, which in turn forwards the packet to the relevant egress
       PE router according to the host route learnt from that egress PE
       router.  As such, the RIB size of PE routers can be greatly
       reduced at the cost of path stretch.

   4.  In order to forward packets destined for that remote CE host
       directly to the corresponding egress PE router without any
       potential path stretch penalty, ingress PE routers could perform
       on-demand route learning of remote host routes by using one of
       the following options:

       A.  Upon receiving an ARP request or Neighbor Solicitation (NS)
           message from a local CE host, if there is no CE host route
           for that target host in its RIB yetthe ingress PE router
           would request the corresponding CE host route for the target
           host from its RR by using the L3VPN Address Prefix ORF
           mechanism.

       B.  Upon receiving a packet whose longest-matching FIB entry is a
           particular more specific subnet routes (e.g., 10.1.1.0/25 and
           10.1.1.128/25) learnt from the RR, a copy of this packet
           would be sent to the control plane while this original packet
           is forwarded as normal.  The above copy sent to the control
           plane would trigger a route pull for that destination CE
           host.  To provide robust protection against DoS attacks on
           the control plane, rate-limiting of the above packets sent to
           the control plane MUST be enabled.

   5.  RIB entries of remote CE host routes would expire if they have
       not been used for forwarding for a certain period of time.  Once
       the expiration time for a given RIB entry is approaching, the PE
       router would notify its RR to remove the corresponding L3VPN
       Address Prefix ORF entry for that CE host route by using the
       L3VPN Address Prefix ORF mechanism.

5.  IANA Considerations

   There is no requirement for any IANA action.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document doesn't introduce additional security risk to BGP/MPLS
   IP VPN, nor does it provide any additional security feature for BGP/
   MPLS IP VPN.
