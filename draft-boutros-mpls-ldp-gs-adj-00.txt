Abstract 

   This document specifies an extension to Label Distribution Protocol 
   (LDP) using which a Label Switched Router (LSR) can explicitly notify 
   its neighbor LSR its intention to shutdown one or more LDP 
   adjacencies. This extension shall be used to shutdown LDP adjacencies 
   for planned maintenance without interrupting traffic.

1. Introduction 

   In an MPLS network where LDP is used to establish Label Switched 
   Paths (LSPs), there could be more than one LDP-enabled links between 
   a pair of Label Switched Routers (LSRs). In this case, LDP Hello 
   adjacency can be formed over more than one such links between the 
   LSRs, and MPLS traffic can be sent over all links supporting 
   adjacency for load balancing purpose. 
    
   In case where multiple links exist between a pair of LSRs, an 
   operator may want to gracefully shutdown LDP adjacency(ies) on one or 
   more links (but not all) without bringing down the LDP session 
   between the corresponding LSRs. Such planned shutdown can be required 
   for maintenance purpose. In this context, the word "gracefully" means 
   ceasing to use the specified link(s) for forwarding MPLS traffic with 
   minimal or no traffic loss. It is possible to tweak the IGP metric of 
   the link(s) so that IGP best paths do not include the link(s) from 
   which MPLS traffic is to be diverted. However, this approach moves 
   not only MPLS traffic but also IP traffic thereby causing unnecessary 
   churn in the network. Furthermore, since IGP metric is tweaked, IGP 
   updates must be triggered and advertised throughout the network which 
   also creates unnecessary routing messages. It is also possible that 
   LDP paths are learned via static routing in which case no amount of 
   IGP tweaking would help. Using LDP mechanisms available today, 
   operator could gracefully shutdown one or more LDP sessions on a 
   given LSR. However, such mechanisms cannot be used for gracefully 
   disabling LDP on specific adjacency(ies) between LSRs. 

   In this document, we propose a mechanism to gracefully shutdown Hello 
   adjacency(ies) between a pair of LSRs without shutting down the LDP 
   session if multiple Hello adjacencies exist between those LSRs. Note 
   that the proposed method can also be used to gracefully shutdown 
   targeted Hello adjacency as well provided that there is such a need.

2. Terminology 

   GS: Graceful Shutdown 

   IGP: Interior Gateway Protocol 

   LSP: Label Switch Path 

   LSR: Label Switch Router 

   TLV: Type Length Value 

3. Graceful Shutdown Mechanism 

   The proposed mechanism is based on a new optional TLV called 
   "Graceful Shutdown" TLV to be included in LDP Hello message. This TLV 
   is similar to the existing optional parameters specified in RFC5036 
   [1]. An LSR that intends to terminate a Hello adjacency sends a Hello 
   message with the Graceful Shutdown (GS) TLV. Since Hello messages are 
   sent over UDP, the proposed mechanism expects the receiving LSR to 
   acknowledge the receipt of GS request by sending a Hello message with 
   a GS TLV back to the sender. The value of GS TLV indicates whether 
   the GS TLV represents the request or acknowledgement as described 
   later in this document. However, if the receiver does not support GS 
   TLV, the sender will not receive an acknowledgement. In this case, 
   the sender will shutdown the corresponding adjacency based on a local 
   policy (e.g., after sending a certain number of Hello messages with 
   GS TLV or after a certain period of time since the Hello message with 
   GS TLV was sent). 

   Note that an LSR can have multiple adjacencies over a shared media 
   link; one for each neighbor LSR connected via the link. Thus, each 
   Hello message originating from an LSR will be sent over all the 
   adjacencies on the link. The LSR initiating GS will bring down an 
   adjacency after either getting GS acknowledgement from the 
   corresponding neighbor LSR or a certain period of time (whichever

   comes first). An operator may want to disable LDP on a shared media 
   link after gracefully shutting down all adjacencies over the link.  

   If an LSR capable of recognizing GS TLV receives a Hello message with 
   GS request TLV and the adjacency does not exist, it will immediately 
   send a Hello message with GS acknowledgement TLV.  

   If an LSR capable of recognizing GS TLV receives a Hello message with 
   GS acknowledgement TLV from a neighbor and the LSR has not sent GS 
   request TLV, it will simply ignores the GS TLV.   

4. Graceful Shutdown TLV 

   The GS TLV has the following format: 

   0                   1                   2                   3 
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |1|0|       0x0404              |           Length              | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |R|                       Reserved                              | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    

   Type is to be assigned by IANA (recommended value is 0x0404). 

   Length is set to 4 indicating that the value field is 4 Octet long. 

   R-bit: indicates whether the Hello message is for graceful shutdown 
   request or acknowledgement. This bit is set to 1 and 0 for request 
   and acknowledgement respectively. 

   Reserved: This field is ignored.  

   If an LSR does not support GS TLV, it should silently ignore the GS 
   TLV and process the rest of the message. Furthermore, the LSR does

Internet-Draft   draft-boutros-mpls-gs-ldp-adj-00.txt         July 2008 
    

   not forward the GS TLV any further. Thus, the U and F bits are set to 
   1 and 0 respectively in accordance with RFC5036. 

   If the Hello message contains multiple GS TLVs, only the first one is 
   taken into consideration. 

5. Operation 

   An LSR initiating GS carries out the following steps: 

   1. Update the forwarding entries such that the adjacency being 
      shutdown is no longer used in the data plane to transmit MPLS 
      packets belonging to LDP applications to the receiver. 

   2. Send up to N Hello messages with GS request (R bit set to 1) TLV. 
      These messages are sent at the configured Hello interval. The 
      default value of N is 2. The LSR does not send more than N Hello 
      messages even if it does not receive GS acknowledgement TLV (R bit 
      set to 0) from the receiver. 

   3. Stop sending any more Hello messages (even if it has not sent N 
      Hello messages) and go to step 7 if the LSR receives a Hello 
      message with GS acknowledgement TLV. 

   4. After sending N Hello messages with GS request TLV without getting 
      any Hello message with GS acknowledgement TLV from the receiver, 
      stop sending any more Hello messages and start a timer (let us 
      call it the "GS timer"). The expiry value of the GS timer can be 
      configured and has a default value equal to the Hello adjacency 
      expiry timer value. 

   5. While waiting for the GS timer to expire, if a Hello message with 
      GS acknowledgment TLV arrives from the receiver, stop the GS timer 
      and go to step 7. 

   6. Wait until the GS timer expires and then go to step 7.

   7. Update the forwarding plane such that MPLS packets belonging to 
      LDP applications are no longer received from the receiver over the 
      shutdown adjacency.  

   An LSR receiving GS request carries out the following steps: 

   1. If the GS TLV is recognized, update the forwarding plane such that 
      the adjacency being shutdown is no longer used in the data plane 
      to transmit MPLS packets belonging to LDP applications. If GS TLV 
      is not recognized, simply ignore the TLV. 

   2. Send a Hello message with GS acknowledgement TLV if the GS TLV is 
      recognized. If the GS TLV is not recognized and Hello messages are 
      not received from the sender during the Hello adjacency expiry 
      period, update the forwarding plane such that the adjacency is no 
      longer used in the data plane to transmit MPLS packets belonging 
      to LDP applications to the sender. 

   3. Continue to send Hello messages corresponding to the adjacency 
      being shutdown so that the adjacency can be brought up again if 
      necessary. 

   In case both LSRs corresponding to an adjacency initiate GS at the 
   same time, each LSR removes the adjacency from the forwarding plane 
   upon getting the GS acknowledgement from its neighbor or on the 
   expiry of GS timer (whichever comes first). 

6. Security Considerations 

   The security considerations pertaining to LDP Hello messages are 
   discussed in RFC5036. The optional GS TLV introduced in this document 
   does not impose any extra security concern or requirement.
