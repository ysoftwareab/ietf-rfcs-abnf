1.  Abstract

   In order to enhance the interoperability of roaming and tunneling
   services, it is desirable to have a standardized method for
   identifying users.  This document proposes syntax for the Network
   Access Identifier (NAI), the userID submitted by the client during
   PPP authentication. It is expected that this will be of interest for
   support of roaming as well as tunneling.  &quot;Roaming capability&quot; may be
   loosely defined as the ability to use any one of multiple Internet
   service providers (ISPs), while maintaining a formal, customer-vendor
   relationship with only one.  Examples of where roaming capabilities
   might be required include ISP &quot;confederations&quot; and ISP-provided
   corporate network access support.

2.  Introduction

   Considerable interest has arisen recently in a set of features that
   fit within the general category of &quot;roaming capability&quot; for dialup
   Internet users.  Interested parties have included:

        Regional Internet Service Providers (ISPs) operating within a
        particular state or province, looking to combine their efforts
        with those of other regional providers to offer dialup service
        over a wider area.

        National ISPs wishing to combine their operations with those of
        one or more ISPs in another nation to offer more comprehensive
        dialup service in a group of countries or on a continent.

        Businesses desiring to offer their employees a comprehensive
        package of dialup services on a global basis.  Those services
        may include Internet access as well as secure access to
        corporate intranets via a Virtual Private Network (VPN), enabled
        by tunneling protocols such as PPTP, L2F, L2TP, and IPSEC tunnel
        mode.

   In order to enhance the interoperability of roaming and tunneling
   services, it is desirable to have a standardized method for
   identifying users.  This document proposes syntax for the Network
   Access Identifier (NAI).  Examples of implementations that use the
   NAI, and descriptions of its semantics, can be found in [1].

2.1.  Terminology

   This document frequently uses the following terms:

   Network Access Identifier
             The Network Access Identifier (NAI) is the userID submitted
             by the client during PPP authentication.  In roaming, the
             purpose of the NAI is to identify the user as well as to
             assist in the routing of the authentication request.
             Please note that the NAI may not necessarily be the same as
             the user&#x27;s e-mail address or the userID submitted in an
             application layer authentication.

   Network Access Server
             The Network Access Server (NAS) is the device that clients
             dial in order to get access to the network. In PPTP
             terminology this is referred to as the PPTP Access
             Concentrator (PAC), and in L2TP terminology, it is referred
             to as the L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC).

   Roaming Capability
             Roaming capability can be loosely defined as the ability to
             use any one of multiple Internet service providers (ISPs),
             while maintaining a formal, customer-vendor relationship
             with only one. Examples of cases where roaming capability
             might be required include ISP &quot;confederations&quot; and ISP-
             provided corporate network access support.

   Tunneling Service
             A tunneling service is any network service enabled by
             tunneling protocols such as PPTP, L2F, L2TP, and IPSEC
             tunnel mode.  One example of a tunneling service is secure
             access to corporate intranets via a Virtual Private Network
             (VPN).

2.2.  Requirements language

   In this document, the key words &quot;MAY&quot;, &quot;MUST, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;optional&quot;,
   &quot;recommended&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, and &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, are to be interpreted as
   described in [9].

2.3.  Purpose

   As described in [1], there are now a number of services implementing
   dialup roaming, and the number of Internet Service Providers involved
   in roaming consortia is increasing rapidly.

   In order to be able to offer roaming capability, one of the
   requirements is to be able to identify the user&#x27;s home authentication
   server.  For use in roaming, this function is accomplished via the
   Network Access Identifier (NAI) submitted by the user to the NAS in
   the initial PPP authentication.  It is also expected that NASes will
   use the NAI as part of the process of opening a new tunnel, in order
   to determine the tunnel endpoint.

2.4.  Notes for Implementors

   As proposed in this document, the Network Access Identifier is of the
   form user@realm.  Please note that while the user portion of the NAI
   conforms to the BNF described in [5], the BNF of the realm portion
   allows the realm to begin with a digit, which is not permitted by the
   BNF described in [4]. This change was made to reflect current
   practice; although not permitted by the BNF described in [4], FQDNs
   such as 3com.com are commonly used, and accepted by current software.

   Please note that NAS vendors may need to modify their devices so as
   to support the NAI as described in this document. Devices handling
   NAIs MUST support an NAI length of at least 72 octets.

3.  Formal definition of the NAI

   The grammar for the NAI is given below, described in ABNF as
   documented in [7].  The grammar for the username is taken from [5],
   and the grammar for the realm is an updated version of [4].

5.  Security Considerations

   Since an NAI reveals the home affiliation of a user, it may assist an
   attacker in further probing the username space. Typically this
   problem is of most concern in protocols which transmit the user name
   in clear-text across the Internet, such as in RADIUS, described in
   [2] and [3].  In order to prevent snooping of the user name,
   protocols may use confidentiality services provided by IPSEC,
   described in [8].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new namespace that will need to be
   administered, namely the NAI realm namespace. In order to to avoid
   creating any new administrative procedures, administration of the NAI
   realm namespace will piggyback on the administration of the DNS
   namespace.

   NAI realm names are required to be unique and the rights to use a
   given NAI realm for roaming purposes are obtained coincident with
   acquiring the rights to use a particular fully qualified domain name
   (FQDN).  Those wishing to use an NAI realm name should first acquire
   the rights to use the corresponding FQDN. Using an NAI realm without
   ownership of the corresponding FQDN creates the possibility of
   conflict and therefore is to be discouraged.

   Note that the use of an FQDN as the realm name does not imply use of
   the DNS for location of the authentication server or for
   authentication routing.  Since to date roaming has been implemented
   on a relatively small scale, existing implementations typically
   handle location of authentication servers within a domain and perform
   authentication routing based on local knowledge expressed in proxy
   configuration files. The implementations described in [1] have not
   found a need for use of DNS for location of the authentication server
   within a domain, although this can be accomplished via use of the DNS
   SRV record, described in [6].  Similarly, existing implementations
   have not found a need for dynamic routing protocols, or propagation
   of global routing information.  Note also that there is no
   requirement that the NAI represent a valid email address.
