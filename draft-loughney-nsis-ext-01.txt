Abstract

   This document discusses the Next Steps in Signaling extensibility
   model.  This model is based upon a two-layer model, where there is a
   transport layer and a signaling application model.  This two-layer
   provides the ability to develope new signaling applications, while
   retaining the use of a common transport layer.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].

2.  Introduction

   The Next Steps in Signaling Framework NSIS Framework [2] details a
   basic two-layer framework for signaling on the Internet.  The
   document decomposes signaling into a two-layer model, into a generic
   transport layer and specific signaling layers.

   This model allows for an extensible model for different signaling
   needs on the the Internet.  Currently, the NSIS working group is
   working on two main signaling applications - QoS signaling [3] and
   Nat/Firewall signaling [4].

   The NSIS Transport Layer Protocol (NTLP) NTLP [5] defines a basic
   protocol for routing and transport of per-flow signaling along the
   path taken by that flow through the network; managing the underlying
   transport and security protocols.

   Above the NTLP are one or more NSIS Signaling Layer protocols, which
   can signal for things such as QoS, firewall control and NAT signaling
   QoS NSLP [3], NAT/FW NSLP [4].  These signaling applications manage
   their state by using the services that the NTLP provides them for
   signaling.

   This two layer approach allows for signaling applications to be
   developed indepently of the transport.  As it is likely that the
   functionality entities for different signaling applications will be
   distinct, the

3.  NTLP Extensibility

   The NTLP name space, identified by IANA, is divided into ranges.  The
   extensibility rules for the ranges defined in the NTLP space are
   based upon the procedures by which IANA assigns values: "Standards
   Action" (as defined in [IANA]), "IETF Action", "Expert Review", and
   "Organization/Vendor Private", defined below.

   Extensions subject to "IETF Action" require either a Standards Track
   RFC, Experimental RFC or an Information RFC.

   Extensions subject to "Expert Review" refer to values that are to be
   reviewed by an Expert designated by the IESG.  The code points from
   these ranges are typically used for experimental extensions; such

Internet-Draft          NSIS Extensibility Model               July 2005


   assignments MUST be requested by either Experimental or Information
   RFCs that document their use and processing, and the actual
   assignments made during the IANA actions for the document.  Values
   from "Expert Review" ranges MUST be registered with IANA.

   "Organization/Vendor Private" ranges refer to values that are
   enterprise-specific.  In this way, different enterprises, vendors, or
   Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) can use the same code
   point without fear of collision.

   NTLP specifies the following registries listed below.

3.1  GIMPS Message Type

   The NTLP common header contains a one-byte message type field
   (initially distinguishing Query, Response, Confirm and Data
   messages).  New message types require Standards Action.

3.2  NSLP Identifiers

   Each signaling application requires one of more NSLPIDs (different
   NSLPIDs may be used to distinguish different classes of signaling
   node, for example to handle different aggregation levels or different
   processing subsets).  An NSLPID must be associated with a unique RAO
   value.  IETF Action is required to allocate a new NSLP Identifier.

3.3  Object Types

   The generic object header as a field which distinguish differentes
   ranges for different allocation styles (standards action, expert
   review etc.) and different applicability scopes (experimental/
   private, NSLP-specific); by default, object types are public and
   shared between all NSLPs.  When a new object type is defined, the
   extensibility bits must also be defined.

3.4  Extensibility Flags

   The generic object header defined in NTLP contains reserved flag
   bits.  These are reserved for the definition of more complex
   extensibility encoding schemes.  Standards Action is required to
   define new Extensibility Flags.

3.5  Message Routing Methods

   NTLP allows the idea of multiple message routing methods.  The
   message routing method is indicated in the leading 2 bytes of the MRI
   object.  NTLP allocates 2 bits for experimental Routing Methods, for
   use in closed networks for experimentation purposes.  Standards

Internet-Draft          NSIS Extensibility Model               July 2005


   Action is required to allocate new Routing Methods.

3.6  Protocol Indicators

   The GIMPS design allows the set of possible protocols to be used in a
   messaging association to be extended.  Every new mode of using a
   protocol is given by a Protocol Indicator, which is used as a tag in
   the Node Addressing and Stack Proposal objects.  New protocol
   indicators require IETF Action.  Allocating a new protocol indicator
   requires defining the higher layer addressing information in the Node
   Addressing Object that is needed to define its configuration.

3.7  Error Classes

   The Error Classes are primarily to aid human or management
   interpretation of otherwise unknown error codes.  These are allocated
   on an Expert Review basis.

3.8  Error Codes

   Error codes are shared across all NSLPs.  When a new error code is
   allocated, the Error Class and the format of any associated error-
   specific information must also be defined.  These are allocated on an
   Expert Review basis.

3.9  Router Alert Values

   Router Alert Option (RAO) values are allocated on the basis of IETF
   consensis.  However, new RAO values SHOULD NOT be allocated for each
   new NSLP.  Careful consideration needs to be exercised when choosing
   to allocate a new RAO value.  This section discusses some
   considerations on how to choose if an existing RAO option should be
   chosen or a new RAO should be allocated for an NSLP

   The RAO contains a 16 bit value field, 35 values which have currently
   been assigned by IANA.  The use of the RAO is the primary mechanism
   to indicate that an NTLP message should be intercepted by a
   particular node.  There are two basic reasons why a NTLP node might
   wish not to intercept a particular message.  The first reason would
   be because the message is for a signaling application that the node
   does not process.  The second reason would be because the node is
   processes signaling messages at the aggregate level, not for
   individual flow, even though the signaling application is present on
   the node.  However, these reasons do not preclude a node processing
   several RAO values, implying it supports several different signaling
   applications.

   Some of this information can be encoded in the RAO value field, which

Internet-Draft          NSIS Extensibility Model               July 2005


   then allows messages to be filtered on the fast path.  There is a
   tradeoff between two approaches here, whose evaluation depends on
   whether the processing node is specialised or general purpose:

   Fine-Grained: The signaling application (including specific version)
   and aggregation level are directly identified in the RAO value.  A
   specialised node which handles only a single NSLP can efficiently
   ignore all other messages; a general purpose node may have to match
   the RAO value in a message against a long list of possible values.

   Coarse-Grained> RAO values are allocated are ased on common
   applications or sets of applications (such as 'All QoS Signaling
   Applications').  This speeds up the processing in a general purpose
   node, but a specialised node may have to carry out further processing
   on the NTLP common header to identify the precise messages it needs
   to consider.

   These considerations imply that the RAO value should not be tied
   directly to the NSLPID, but should be selected for the application on
   broader considerations of likely deployment scenarios.  Note that the
   exact NSLP is given in the GIMPS common header, and some
   implementations may still be able to process it on the fast path.
   The semantics of the node dropping out of the signaling path are the
   same however the filtering is done.

   There is a special consideration in the case of the aggregation
   level.  In this case, whether a message should be processed depends
   on the network region it is in (specifically, the link it is on).
   There are then two basic possibilities:

   All routers have essentially the same algorithm for which messages
   they process, i.e. all messages at aggregation level 0.  However,
   messages have their aggregation level incremented on entry to an
   aggregation region and decremented on exit.

   Router interfaces are configured to process messages only above a
   certain aggregation level and ignore all others.  The aggregation
   level of a message is never changed; signaling messages for end to
   end flows have level 0, but signaling messages for aggregates are
   generated with a higher level.

   The first technique requires aggregating/deaggregating routers to be
   configured with which of their interfaces lie at which aggregation
   level, and also requires consistent message rewriting at these
   boundaries.  The second technique eliminates the rewriting, but
   requires interior routers to be configured also.  It is not clear
   what the right trade-off between these options is.

4.  NSLP Extensibility

4.1  Common Functionality Among Signaling Applications

   While NSIS has adopted a two-layer signaling approach, in practice,
   there is much in common between different NSLPs.  This section covers
   the common values as well as specific NSLP registries.

4.1.1  Common Error Codes

   There is a common Error Code format across all NSLPs.  The Error Code
   contains an Error Type, Error Code, NSLPID and an optional additional
   error field.  This document will list the main Error Types and Error
   Codes.

   Allocation of new Error Types require IETF Action; allocation of new
   Error Codes is 'first come, first serve.'

4.2  NAT FW NSLP Extensibility

   TBA

4.3  QoS NSLP Extensibility

   TBA

5.  QoS Model Extensibility

   The QoS NSLP provides signaling for QoS reservations on the Internet.
   The QoS NSLP decouples the resource reservation model or architecture
   from the signaling.  The QoS specification is defined in QSpec [6].
   New QSpecs require IETF action, which defines the elements within the
   QSpec.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document outlines the basic rules for extending NSIS protocols.
   This instructions IANA on allocation policies for NSIS protocols.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document is an informational document, outlining the
   extensibility model of the NSIS protocol suite.  As such, this
   document does not impact the security of the Internet directly.

8.  Acknowledgements

   This document borrows some ideas and some text from RFC3936 [7],
