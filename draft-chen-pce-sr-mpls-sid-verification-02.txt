          Updates to SID Verification for SR-MPLS in RFC 8664
               draft-chen-pce-sr-mpls-sid-verification-02

Abstract

   This document updates [RFC8664] to clarify usage of "SID
   verification" bit signalled in Path Computation Element Protocol
   (PCEP), and this document proposes to define a new flag for
   indicating the headend is explicitly requested to verify SID(s) by
   the PCE.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] describes the "SID
   verification" bit usage.  SID verification is performed when the
   headend is explicitly requested to verify SID(s) by the controller
   via the signaling protocol used.  Implementations MAY provide a local
   configuration option to enable verification on a global or per policy
   or per candidate path basis.

   [RFC8664] specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute
   and initiate Traffic-Engineering (TE) paths, as well as a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) to request a path subject to certain
   constraints and optimization criteria in SR networks.

   This document updates [RFC8664] to clarify usage of "SID
   verification" bit signalled in Path Computation Element Protocol
   (PCEP), and this document proposes to define a new flag for
   indicating the headend is explicitly requested to verify SID(s) by
   the PCE.

3.  SID verification flag(V-Flag)

3.1.  Extended V-Flag in SR-ERO Subobject

   Section 4.3.1 in Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
   (PCEP) Extensions for Segment Routing [RFC8664] describes a new ERO
   subobject referred to as the "SR-ERO subobject" to carry a SID and/or
   NAI information.  A new flag is proposed in this doucument in the SR-
   ERO Subobject for indicating the pcc is explicitly requested to
   verify SID(s) by the PCE.

   The format of the SR-ERO subobject as defined in [RFC8664] is:



        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |L|   Type=TBD  |     Length    |  NT   |     Flags   |V|F|S|C|M|
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                         SID (optional)                        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       //                   NAI (variable, optional)                  //
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

            Figure 1 SR-ERO Subobject Format of extended V-Flag

   V: When the V-Flag is set then PCC MUST consider the "SID
   verification" as described in Section 5.1 in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].

   The other fields in the SR-ERO subobject is the same as that of the
   SR-ERO subobject as defined in [RFC8664].

3.2.  Extended V-Flag in SR-RRO Subobject

   The format of the SR-RRO subobject is the same as that of the SR-ERO
   subobject, but without the L-Flag, per [RFC8664].

   The V flag has no meaning in the SR-RRO and is ignored on receipt at
   the PCE.
