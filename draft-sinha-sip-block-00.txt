Abstract

   This document define a new response code, 4XX(BLOCKED), for a
   Session Initiation Protocol(SIP).This response code can used by
   User Agent Client(UAC)that it intensely does not want to have 
   session with   an incoming request with particular SIP services 
   from particular domain. For example, UAC do not want to establish
   a session with an incoming request for video conference from
   particular domain. The existing mechanism in SIP do not provide
   any such facility to refuse a   request based request URI, SIP
   application, media type and other SIP services.

1.  Introduction	

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows users to establish SIP
   sessions with various capabilities. However, a user receiving such a
   request has no option to block the call based on phone number, domain
   name, etc. This document proposes a way to block any incoming call
   based on phone  number, URI, domain, as well as based on the SIP
   applications like SMS,voice, video, codec etc. The proposal is also
   to generate a valid 4XX response code that would inform the calling
   party that the request is blocked for such a SIP services.

   The SIP, currently, does not provide a response code that allows the
   UAS or a proxy acting on behalf of SIP Client(User) to indicate that
   the request was rejected because the callee doesn’t want to go ahead
   with sip session with specific application services with caller. In
   other word, SIP does not include a response code that could be sent
   across to a caller informing him that the callee will not accept the
   invitation for the intended service.with the caller.

Internet-Draft          The SIP BLOCKED Response	     August 2006



   The closest response code is 403 (Forbidden), which denotes
   unauthorized access is prohibited. This does not inform the caller 
   that the call was rejected because the invite originated from a
   specific phone number for a specific service which the callee had
   blocked from his side. 

   As a permanent solution, this document defines a new 4XX
   (Blocked) response code, belonging to client error,.



2.   Terminology


   The key words “MUST”,  “MUST NOT”,  “REQUIRED”,  "SHALL”, “SHALL
   NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY” and “OPTIONAL” in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[1].


3.   Scope

   This document defines a new response code that will be sent across 
   to the caller when the callee blocks certain applications, like 
   INVITE, SUBSCRIBE, SUBSCRIBE, etc , originating from specific URI
   (SIP URI/ TEL URI), specific domain, or from specific host. In 
   other words this proposition says how a callee can set his profile
   and not accept incoming SIP request. It is basically a 
   implementation of “Do not Disturb”  terminology in SIP.

   The 4XX response code sent against blocked incoming requests can be
   classified based on the blocking of the SIP application’s services
   at various levels. 


   The Blocking capabilities levels are listed below:
  1) Blocking at user level.
  2) Blocking at domain level.
  3) Full blocking as well as partial blocking.
  4) Neither SIP Proxy server nor any other SIP entity has anything to
     do with activation/deactivation of this feature,i.e., it is
     implemented only at UAC side.
  5) Decision of Blocking is taken at UAC only. Proxies do not have to
     perform any kind of processing.
  6) Broadcast message cannot be blocked.
  7) Caller could know that a particular SIP services is blocked,by
     receiving final 4XX response to its request.
  8) Current on-going SIP session will not be affected, if the
     activation or deactivation is done during session, only for the
     participants involved in the session. But users who are likely to

   establish a new SIP session with the participants in an already
   existing session will be effected even if the blocking is done during
   a SIP session with another party. 

   For example, assume three end points A, B and C. If A and B are in a
   conversation and B tries to block incoming requests from A, the
   effect is not immediate. The block will take effect from the
   subsequent requests that A can possibly make with B. On the contrary
   if B is in conversation with A and is trying to block C the change
   will be immediate. This would mean that after A and B finish the call
   and if C tries to establish a session with B, he will be responded to
   with a 4XX response that he is blocked to establish such a connection
   with B. 

  9) Quality of Service: To make an outgoing SIP call, SIP request is
   sent with a list of codec, in an order that is preferred by the User.
   In the same way by using this feature, the user can choose the codec.
   That is, if a user is willing to go for good quality of voice. 

4.  Definition

   The BLOCKING feature enables a subscriber to block an
   unwanted invite for communication. This feature is to be present at 
   the User side from where the UAC can configure using "BLOCKING" 
   option on its gui, for GUI based SIP client or through the command
   line interface (CLI) option for non-gui based SIP Client. Also,
   this Blocking feature, would be contains more option for a User to
   wherein  he could do more enhanced blocking like Codec blocking,
   request blocking, and other SIP services as mentioned and discussed
   in the subsequent session below.

   A 4XX (Blocked) is a response that will indicate that the UAS refuses
   to fulfill the incoming request because it was blocked. The default
   reason phrase is ‘Blocked’.

   There are two types of Blocking:
           1. Full Blocking.    
           2. Partial Blockeing.


4.1 Full Blocking

   When a User wants to block a call from a particular URL and/or SIP 
   services arising from URL, he can use this “Full Block” methodology 
   to do so. The Full Blocking feature is applicable in the following
   scenario.

   When a User wants to block a call from a particular domain, he can
   use this “Full Blockage” option to do so. The UAC just has to 
   configure "*" against blocking option followed by that domain name,



Individual Submission                                           [Page 4]

Internet-Draft          The SIP BLOCKED Response	     August 2006



   like "*@domain_name" against blocking option. Whenever a call lands
   from that domain, it will be rejected and a 4XX response code will
   be sent across to notify the caller that he was completely blocked
   from reaching this particular callee.

   Similarly when a User wants to block a call from a particular phone
   or SIP phone, he can use this “Full Blockage” option to do so. The
   UAC just has to configure <Phone_Number> or <SIP_Request_URI> for
   SIP devices against blocking option, like "9845661514” phone number
   or ‘User_A@domain_name.com, against blocking option. Whenever a call
   lands from blocked phone, it will be rejected and a 4XX response 
   code will be sent across.

   Similarly when a User wants to block incoming Instant Message, he can
   use this “Full Blockage” option to do so. The UAC just has to 
   configure “MESSAGE”,against blocking option. Whenever a call lands 
   from the blocked phone, it will be rejected with 4XX response code.

   Whereas if UAC wants a complete blocking of incoming PSTN request
   from certain location , then UAC only need to configure location
   area code against blocking option, like “+9180*” will block all in
   coming request from city Bangalore of India.


4.2  Partial Blocking

   When a User wants to block a call from a 
   particular URL and/or SIP services, he can use this “Partial
   Blockage” methodology to do so. This would mean that if the user does
   not wish to accept a certain type of media session from a particular
   caller or URL, say video, he can do so using the partial blocking 
   option. The Partial Blocking feature is explained fully with some
   examples in section 8.2.

   For example, if UAC wants to block only Instant Message from some
   particular SIP client, then UAC configures his blocking option like
   <Request-URI_of_User_A> followed by IM” against blocking option.

   With this, UAC can receive all request coming from User A, but
   all IM originating from User A will be rejected.


4.3  Flow Diagram – Implementation Model of Blocking feature at UAC

   The Flow Diagram below explains how this Blocking Feature is to be 
   implemented in the SIP client. Each step in the flow diagram 
   describes the processing step at UAC on receiving the SIP request.

   Whenever the Blocking feature is activated and the incoming request 
   is received by the UAS it will have to check for the Blocked 
   parameter before proceeding with any SIP Processing. The sequence of
   events on checking the blocked parameter is explained in detail in 
   Table 1.

   |            | Partial match found means that User has configured  |
   |            | some others blocking parameters along with following|
   |            | cases-                                              |
   |            | - has blocked SIP method with some media parameter  |
   |            | - has blocked SIP URI with media parameter          |
   |            | - has blocked both SIP method and SIP Uri with other|
   |            |   media parameters.So it moves into other processing|
   |            |   stage , as in step 4                              |
   |    |-------------------------------------------------------------|
   |    |Case 3 |No Match                                             |
   |    --------|                                                     |
   |            |(i) if user B has blocked Video only                 |
   |            |(ii) if user B has blocked FAX only                  |
   |            |(iii) if User has blocked FAX with some particular   |
   |            |     codec                                           |
   |            |(iv) if User B has blocked FAX and Video both, etc   |
   |            |                                                     |
   |            |Means that the User has blocked only some SDP        |
   |            |parameterSo it moves into other processing stage, as |
   |            |in step 4                                            |
   |------------------------------------------------------------------|
   |Step 4      |If SDP is present in the SIP Request                 |
   |            |                                                     |
   |            |It is a decision making processing step, where our   |
   |            |UAC looks for a SDP capabilities in this incoming SIP|
   |            |request                                              |
   |    |-------------------------------------------------------------|
   |    |Case 1 |No  SDP                                              |
   |    |-------|                                                     |
   |            |Means that the incoming SIP request doesn’t contains |
   |            |SDP protocol.                                        |
   |            |                                                     |
   |            |Since the User has configured some blocking parameter|
   |            |releated to SDP parameters, which is needed to be    |
   |            |verfired with the SDP parameters of the SIP request. |
   |            |                                                     |
   |            |So it generated 4XX response code with require header|
   |            |field, as a mandatory parameter.The require header   |
   |            |filed values should be set to=SDP                    |
   |    |-------------------------------------------------------------|
   |    |Case 2 |Yes- SDP Present                                     |
   |    --------|                                                     |
   |            |UAC moves to next processing step 5, for further     |
   |            |matching on SDP parameters.                          |
   -------------------------------------------------------------------|
   |Step 5      |Check If Blocked SIP services matches with SDP       |
   |            |parameters.                                          |

   |            |Proceed as per RFC 3261This is because the configured|
   |            |blocking parameters doesn’t match with incoming SDP  |
   |            |of SIP request                                       |
   |    |-------------------------------------------------------------|
   |    |Case 2 |Match found                                          |

   |            |It generates the 4xx response code (Blocked ) to     |
   |            |indicate the caller that the he blocked with this SIP|
   |            |request.                                             |
   --------------------------------------------------------------------


5.  UAS Behavior

   A UAS described below is  a SIP UAS that receives SIP request with
   SDP and return a 4XX (Blocked) response.


   A SIP UAS while responding with a 4XX (Blocked) response to an Invite
   without SDP MUST add the ‘required’ header with ‘SDP required’ as 
   header field value.


6.  UAC Behavior

   A SIP UAC receiving a 4XX(Blocked) response for a request originated
   from it,  MAY retry the request. It SHOULD only do so if it obtains a
   confirmation from the callee that this is desirable. Such 
   confirmation could be obtained through a ‘required’ header of the 4XX
   (Blocked) response. So, if Originating SIP client receives 4xx
   (Blocked) response with ‘require’ header filed value=SDP, he it could
   resent the request with SDP.

   A UAC that  does not understand a 4XX (Blocked) response, will 
   interpret it as a  400 response, for backward compatibility.

7.  4XX Response Code

   The 4XX response code, as it is related to client error so it belongs
   to Client Error response category. This response may or may not
   include reason header field with it, depending upon the vendor 
   implementation, except for the case in 8.2.2 section where it is 
   mandatory. Information about header field in relation to 4XX(Blocked)
   response code(i.e. Full Blocked and Partial Blocked)is summarized in
   Table 2. The Full Blocked and Partial Blocked column relate to the
   presence of a header field in the response:

       m: the header field is mandatory.
       o: the header field is optional.


   "OPTIONAL" means that an element MAY include the header field in a
   response and a UA may ignore the same. A "MANDATORY" header field
   MUST be present in a response and the header field MUST be
   understood by UAC processing the response. Otherwise it will be
   treated as a normal 4XX response.

8.   Call Flow

   This section explains a detailed call flow between two SIP User-Agents
   (Alice and Bob). Alice (sip:alice@atlanta.example.com) and Bob
   (sip:bob@biloxi.example.com) are assumed to be SIP phone or
   SIP-enabled devices. For simplicity in reading and editing the
   document, only the minimum required header field set is shown in
   below examples.

8.1  Full Blocked

   In this following example scenario, Bob has Full Blocked the Alice's
   phone number. In other word Bob don't want to have any kind of
   session with Alice. The UAC at Bob refuse to process the INVITE
   request and reply with 4XX(Blocked) response to Alice.

   the call.

9.1  Interaction with SIP Presence

   Presence protocol which is mainly concerned about established
   subscription ( or long-term relation ) between devices that transfer
   status information and the delivery of the information.


   As per the rfc 3265, the notifier i.e., Bob when receives the 
   SUSCRIBE message, either he can accept or reject the message. And as
   per implementation prospective is concern, the Bob need to be present
   at the device end so that he could either reject or accept the 
   SUBSCRIBE request.

   On the counter part, with block feature enabled at the Bob device "to
   not to receive SUBSCRIBE", let say for e.g Blocked all SUBSCRIPTION,
   then without being Bob to present at the device end, the SUBSCRIBE 
   request will get rejected with 4XX response code.

   In the call flow below, Alice name is added in a buddy list of Bob,
   and at the same time Bob do not want to gives its status info to 
   Alice,  so he blocks the  SUBSCRIBE for Alice.

   Block ( a step ahead, getting more information on the status of 
   message IM in lieu of getting either 200 or 202 response).

   If Bob does not  IM message from subscriber Alice, then Bob can
   block the reception of Instant Message coming from Alice.

   Thus, on receiving F2 MESSAGE, the UAS at Bob checks for the block
   feature. If user Bob wants partial blocking of message (IM) not
   the full blocking, then he has to set the blocking profile with
   “MESSAGE) parameter. Thus, on receiving F2 MESSAGE, Bob rejects the
   incoming Instant Message by MATCHING method name and the configured
   BLOCKING profile by  4XX response.

9.3 Interaction with Replace Header Field

   Let us assume that the user Alice has three SIP devices, namely 
   Phone-1 and Phone-2 and the User Bob has blocked Alice's Phone-2 SIP 
   device.

   Let us consider a scenario that Alice is in a active SIP session with
   Bob via using her Phone-1.User Alice wants to moves to a different 
   location,it keeps Bob at parking place.

   When Alice again send new INVITE, with replace header field, from
   her another SIP device Phone-2,then it receive 4XX Block response.
   This will indicate that Alice the she is blocked via A-2 SIP device.

/* Wherein the replace header field contains the dialogue-ids of
   established session between Alice and Bob, and contact header field
   contains the new device i.e., Alice's Phone2 location id. Thus on 
   receiving F3 message from device Phone-2,Bobs compares it with its
   blocking feature,which matchs, and thus it rejects this request with 
   4XX response.

   In this scenario, Alice could again send INVITE request to Bob via
   her SIP device Phone-1, as still Bob is in parking place.

   Here we have an advantage that suppose Alice wants Bob to establish
   the SIP session explicitly with Alice via Alice's Phone-2 device,
   then she could say to Bob to unblock Alice's Phone-2 device via 
   another SIP phone (in this example it could be Alice's Phone-1).
   Then after if Bob do so, means unblocks the Alice Phone-2, being in
   Parking place, then when Bob receives INVITE with replace header 
   field via Alice's Phone-2 device, a successful session could be 
   established.



9.4  Interaction with OPTION request

   Since OPTION method is often used in SIP signaling in order to
   get the capabilities and discover the current availability.

   The user agent or server responds to the request as it would to an
   INVITE ( i.e., if it is not accepting calls, it would repond with a
   4xx or 6xx response). A success class (2xx) response can contain 
   Allow, Accept, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language and Supported headers
   indicating its capabilities.

   Whereas those SIP client which has blocking capability 200 Ok, with
   an additional header field, Call-Info header with the field value 
   BLOCKED indicating that the UAC has blocking capability.

10.  IANA Consideration

   This section registers a new SIP response code according to the
   procedure of RFC 3261. RFC Number: RFC XXX [NOTE TO IANA: Please
   replace 4XXX with the RFC number of this specification].

      Response Code Number: 4XX

      Default Reason Phrase: Blocked


11.  Security Consideration

   This document, itself, is concerned with providing SIP session
   participation with a negotiation mechanism for phone-number, SIP URI,
   etc, by blocking other non-acceptable device. This blocking feature
   mechanism gives an user client to have a security measurement.
