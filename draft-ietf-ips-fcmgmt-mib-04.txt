Internet Draft        Fibre Channel Management MIB         February 2003


1.  Introduction

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
particular, it describes managed objects for information related to
Fibre Channel.


1.1.  Change Log

This section to be deleted before publication as an RFC.

1.1.1.  Initial version: draft-ietf-ips-fcmgmt-mib-00.txt

Initial version derived from draft-ietf-ipfc-fcmgmt-int-mib-07.txt and
RFC 2837, and published on 22 January 2002.

1.1.2.  Changes made in draft-ietf-ips-fcmgmt-mib-01.txt

- support added for Class F traffic.

- the description of Class 1 changed to "not widely-implemented"
(instead of "obsolete"), and a reference to FC-MI added.

- Counter32 objects added in order to support old SNMPv1-only systems
which cannot support standard Counter64 objects.

1.1.3.  Changes made in draft-ietf-ips-fcmgmt-mib-02.txt

- aligned the meanings of bits of the FcUnitFunctions TC with the latest
update to the meanings in the GS-4 specification.

- broadened the scope of the fcmEPortTable to apply to any type of port
connected to an inter-swithc link, and changed its descriptor to
fcmISPortTable.

- changed the fcmLinkTable to be optional.

- fixed some minor typos

1.2.  Changes made in draft-ietf-ips-fcmgmt-mib-03.txt

- 'storageDevice' was added as an enumeration of the FcUnitFunctions TC
for compatibility with the latest proposal in T11.

Internet Draft        Fibre Channel Management MIB         February 2003


- fcmISPortClassFCredit was changed to have a MAX-ACCESS of read-write,
but the minimum compliance was kept as read-only.

- several auxiliary objects were changed to exclude 0 as a possible
value (as recommended in section 7.7 of RFC 2578).

- the OIDs of the columnar objects in the fcmPortErrorsTable were
renumbered so as to be consecutive.

1.2.1.  Changes made in draft-ietf-ips-fcmgmt-mib-04.txt

- updated boilerplate as required by the publication of RFCs 3410
through 3418.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel

The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point
serial data channel, structured for high performance capability.  The
Fibre Channel provides a general transport vehicle for higher level
protocols such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small
Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance
Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), IEEE
802.2, and others.

Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple
communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a
switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A
Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may
consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are switches.
An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch called an

Internet Draft        Fibre Channel Management MIB         February 2003


F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single port on a
switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port is called an
FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The term Nx_Port is
used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_port.  The term Fx_Port is
used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_port.  A switch port, which
is interconnected to another switch port via an Inter Element Link
(IEL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a bridge device with an
E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset of E_Port functionality.

Many Fibre Channel components, including the fabric, each node, and most
ports, have globally-unique names.  These globally-unique names are
typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information on
WWNs can be found in [WWN1] and [WWN2].  WWNs are expected to be
persistent across agent and unit resets.

Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers which identify
the frame's source and destination ports.  Each FC port has an address
identifier and a WWN.  When a fabric is in use, the FC address
identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.

4.  MIB Overview

This MIB contains the notion of a Fibre Channel management instance,
which is defined as a separable managed instance of Fibre Channel
functionality.  Fibre Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre
Channel management instances in whatever way is most convenient for the
implementation(s).  For example, one such grouping accommodates a single
SNMP agent having multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with each sub-
agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management instance.

This MIB contains eleven MIB groups, as follows.

4.1.  The fcmInstanceBasicGroup group

This group contains basic information about a Fibre Channel managed
instance, including its name and description, the Fibre Channel
function(s) it performs, and optional pointers to hardware and/or
software components.

4.2.  The fcmSwitchBasicGroup group

This group contains basic information about a Fibre Channel switch,
including its domain-id and whether it is the principal switch of its
fabric.

Internet Draft        Fibre Channel Management MIB         February 2003


4.3.  The fcmPortBasicGroup group

This group contains basic information about a Fibre Channel port,
including its port name (WWN), the name of the node (if any) of which it
is a part, the type of port, the classes of service it supports, its
transmitter and connector types, and the higher level protocols it
supports.

Each Fibre Channel port is represented by an entry in the ifTable (see
below).  The tables relating to ports in this MIB are indexed by the
port's value of ifIndex.

4.4.  The fcmPortStatsGroup group

This group contains traffic statistics, which are not specific to any
particular class of service, for Fibre Channel ports.

4.5.  The fcmPortClass23StatsGroup group

This group contains traffic statistics which are specific to Class 2 or
Class 3 traffic on Fibre Channel ports, including class-specific frame
and octet counters and counters of busy and reject frames.

4.6.  The fcmPortLcStatsGroup group

Some of the statistics in the fcmPortClass23StatsGroup can increase
rapidly enough to warrant them being defined using the Counter64 syntax.
However, some old SNMP systems do not (yet) support Counter64 objects.
Thus, this group defines low-capacity (Counter32-based) equivalents for
the Counter64-based statistics in the fcmPortClass23StatsGroup group.

4.7.  The fcmPortClassFStatsGroup group

This group contains traffic statistics which are specific to Class F
traffic on the E_Ports of a Fibre Channel switch.

4.8.  The fcmPortErrorsGroup group

This group contains counters of various error conditions which can occur
on Fibre Channel ports."

4.9.  The fcmSwitchPortGroup group

This group contains information about ports on a Fibre Channel switch.
For an Fx_Port, it includes the port's timeout values, its hold-time,

and its capabilities in terms of maximum and minimum buffer-to-buffer
credit allocations, maximum and minimum data field size, and support for
class 2 and class 3 sequenced delivery.  For an E_Port or B_Port, it
includes the buffer-to-buffer credit allocation and data field size.

4.10.  The fcmSwitchLoginGroup group

This group contains information, known to a Fibre Channel switch, about
its attached/logged-in Nx_Ports and the service parameters which have
been agreed with them.

4.11.  The fcmLinkBasicGroup group

This group contains information, known to a local Fibre Channel
management instance, about Fibre Channel links, including links which
terminate locally.

5.  Relationship to Other MIBs

This MIB is a replacement for two other MIBs: RFC 2837, and the Fibre
Channel Management Integration MIB which was originally submitted as an
Internet Draft to the IETF's IPFC Working Group as draft-ietf-ipfc-
fcmgmt-int-mib-0n.txt.

5.1.  The Interfaces Group MIB

The Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863] contains generic information about
all lower layer interfaces, i.e., interfaces which are (potentially)
below the internet layer.  Thus, each Fibre Channel port should have its
own row in the ifTable, and that row will contain the generic
information about the interface/port.  The Interfaces Group MIB
specifies that additional information which is specific to a particular
type of interface media, should be defined in a media-specific MIB.
This MIB is the media-specific MIB for Fibre Channel ports/interfaces.

Section 4 of [RFC2863] requires that a media-specific MIB clarify how
the generic definitions apply for the particular type of media.  The
clarifications for Fibre Channel interfaces are as follows.

5.1.1.  Layering Model

The Interfaces Group MIB permits multiple ifTable entries to be defined
for interface sub-layers, and for those multiple entries to be arranged
in a stack.

Internet Draft        Fibre Channel Management MIB         February 2003


For Fibre Channel interfaces, no sublayers are defined and a Fibre
Channel interface will typically have no other ifTable rows stacked on
top of it, nor underneath it.

5.1.2.  Virtual Circuits

This Fibre Channel MIB does not deal with virtual circuits.

5.1.3.  ifRcvAddressTable

The ifRcvAddressTable does not apply to Fibre Channel interfaces.

5.1.4.  ifType

The value of ifType for a Fibre Channel interface is 56.

5.1.5.  ifXxxOctets

The definitions of ifInOctets and ifOutOctets (and similarly,
ifHCInOctets and ifHCOutOctets) specify that their values include
framing characters.  For Fibre Channel interfaces, they include all the
octets contained in frames between the Start-of-Frame and End-of-Frame
delimiters (excluding the delimiters).

5.1.6.  Specific Interface Group MIB Objects

The following table provides specific implementation guidelines for
applying the objects defined in the Interfaces Group MIB to Fibre
Channel interfaces.  For those objects not listed here, refer to their
generic definitions in [RFC2863].  (RFC 2863 takes precedence over these
guidelines in the event of any conflict.)

     Object                   Guidelines

     ifType                   56

     ifMtu                    The MTU as seen by a higher layer
                              protocol, like IP.  That is, when IP is
                              running over the interface, this object is
                              the size of the largest IP datagram that
                              can be sent/received over the interface.

                              yet negotiated to an operational speed,
                              this object SHOULD reflect the maximum
                              speed supported by the interface.

     ifPhysAddress            The interface's 24-bit Fibre Channel
                              Address Identifier, or the zero-length
                              string if no Address Identifier has been
                              assigned to the interface.

     ifAdminStatus            Write access is not required, and support
                              for 'testing' is not required.

     ifOperStatus             Support for 'testing' is not required.
                              The value 'dormant' has no meaning for
                              Fibre Channel interfaces.

     ifInOctets               The number of octets of information
     ifHCInOctets             contained in received frames between the
                              Start-of-Frame and End-of-Frame delimiters
                              (excluding the delimiters).

     ifInUcastPkts            The number of unicast frames received,
     ifHCInUcastPkts          i.e., the number of Start-of-Frame
                              delimiters received for unicast frames.

     ifInErrors               The sum for this interface of

                              plus any errors in fcmPortOtherErrors
                              which were input errors.

     ifOutOctets              The number of octets of information
     ifHCOutOctets            contained in transmitted frames between
                              the Start-of-Frame and End-of-Frame
                              delimiters (excluding the delimiters).

     ifOutErrors              This is the number of errors in
                              fcmPortOtherErrors which were output
                              errors.

     ifInMulticastPkts        These counters are not incremented

     ifHCOutMulticastPkts
     ifHCOutBroadcastPkts

     ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable   Refer to [RFC2863].  Default is 'enabled'

     ifHighSpeed              The current operational speed of the
                              interface in millions of bits per second.
                              For 1Gbs, this will be 1000; for 2Gbs, it
                              will be 2000.  If auto-negotiation is
                              implemented and enabled on an interface,
                              and the interface has not yet negotiated
                              to an operational speed, this object
                              SHOULD reflect the maximum speed supported
                              by the interface.

     ifPromiscuousMode        This will normally be 'false'

     ifConnectorPresent       This will normally be 'true'.

5.2.  Entity MIB

The Entity MIB [RFC2737] contains information about individual physical
components and any hierarchical relationship which may exist between
them.  Any Fibre Channel management instance with a relationship to a
physical component (or to a hierarchy of physical components) will have
its value of the fcmInstancePhysicalIndex object contain a pointer to
the relevant row in the Entity MIB.  If there is no correspondence to a
physical component (or said component does not have a row in the Entity
MIB), then the value of fcmInstancePhysicalIndex is zero.  (Note that an
implementation is not required to support a non-zero value of
fcmInstancePhysicalIndex.)

5.3.  Host Resources MIB

The Host Resources MIB [RFC2790] includes information about installed
software modules.  Any Fibre Channel management instance with a
correspondence to a software module, will have its value of the
fcmInstanceSoftwareIndex object contain a pointer to the relevant row in
the Host Resources MIB.  If there is no correspondence to a software
module (or said software module does not has a row in the Host Resources
MIB), then the value of fcmInstanceSoftwareIndex is zero.  (Note that an
implementation is not required to support a non-zero value of
fcmInstanceSoftwareIndex.)

11.  Security Considerations

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a
MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write:

     fcmInstanceTextName
     fcmInstanceDescr
     fcmSwitchDomainId
     fcmPortAdminType
     fcmPortAdminSpeed
     fcmISPortClassFCredit

Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
environments.  For example, the ability to change network topology or
network speed may afford an attacker the ability to obtain better
performance at the expense of other network users.  The support for SET
operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection can
have a negative effect on network operations.

Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to
even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the
network via SNMP.  In particular, these objects provide information on
network topology:

     fcmLinkEnd1NodeWwn
     fcmLinkEnd1PhysPortNumber
     fcmLinkEnd1PortWwn
     fcmLinkEnd2NodeWwn
     fcmLinkEnd2PhysPortNumber
     fcmLinkEnd2PortWwn
     fcmLinkEnd2AgentAddress
     fcmLinkEnd2PortType
     fcmLinkEnd2UnitType
     fcmLinkEnd2FcAddressId

SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  Even
if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.

It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including

full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication
and privacy).

Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic
security.  It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure that
the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module is
properly configured to give access to the objects only to those
principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
(change/create/delete) them.

12.  Comparison to draft-ietf-ipfc-fcmgmt-int-mib-07.txt

12.1.  Problems with draft-ietf-ipfc-fcmgmt-int-mib-07.txt

The Fibre Channel Management Integration MIB had the following major
problems:

  -  It wasn't formatted using SMIv2, which is mandatory.

  -  The MIB seemed to have been defined with the notion that it would
     be the only MIB that a Fibre Channel product will require.  The
     notion of an agent implementing just a single MIB was abandoned by
     the IETF in 1992 as being non-scaleable.  Rather, a Fibre Channel
     MIB needed to be another MIB in the continuing series of MIBs
     defined by the IETF, and thus, it needed to be consistent with its
     predecessors.  In other words, there are existing MIBs which all
     SNMP agents must support, even if the support of Fibre Channel
     interfaces is the only functionality that they have.  Thus, it was
     essential that the Fibre Channel Integration MIB contained only
     objects for information which is specific to Fibre Channel.  All
     objects relevant to non-Fibre Channel environments needed to be
     removed.  This issue applied to a large fraction of the objects
     defined in the MIB.

  -  The MIB had some but not complete overlap in functionality with RFC
     2837.

  -  Every SNMP agent must implement the ifTable.  The ifTable counters
     are the MIB objects most well-used by administrators in SNMP
     management.  SNMP agents need to implement a row in the ifTable for
     each of their network interfaces, including their Fibre Channel
     interfaces.  The IF-MIB requires a media-specific MIB to specify
     how that type of interface uses the ifTable (see section 4 in RFC
     2863).  RFC 2837 doesn't do that, and nor did the Fibre Channel
     Integration MIB.

  -  It incorrectly used the OCTET STRING syntax (instead of Counter32
     or Counter64) for counters.

Internet Draft        Fibre Channel Management MIB         February 2003


12.2.  Detailed Changes

12.2.1.  Removal of Sensor-related objects

Information about sensors is not specific to Fibre Channel, and
therefore should not be in this MIB.  (At the time of writing, the the
IETF's ENTITY MIB Working Group has produced a first draft of a Sensor
MIB, see [SENSOR].)  This removed the need for:

     connUnitSensorTable (and all its contents)
     connUnitNumSensors
     connUnitSensorStatusChange

12.2.2.  Removal of Trap-registration objects

Information about registering "traps" is not specific to Fibre Channel,
and therefore should not be in this MIB.  (For similar functionality,
see SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB and SNMP-TARGET-MIB in RFC 2573).  This
removed the need for:

     trapMaxClients
     trapClientCount
     trapRegTable (and all its contents)

12.2.3.  Removal of Event-related objects

Information about generic events is not specific to Fibre Channel, and
therefore should not be in this MIB.  (For similar functionality, see
the Event group in RFC 2819 and the Notification Log MIB in RFC 3014;
the SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB provides  for the filtering of notifications.)
This removed the need for:

     connUnitEventTable (and all its contents)
     connUnitEventFilter
     connUnitNumEvents
     connUnitMaxEvents
     connUnitEventCurrID
     connUnitEventTrap

Internet Draft        Fibre Channel Management MIB         February 2003


12.2.4.  Removal of inventory-related information

Aspects of hardware (physical) components are represented in the Entity
MIB (RFC 2737); aspects of software modules are represented in the Host
Resources MIB (RFC 2790).  Two new objects provide indexing from this
MIB into those MIBs: one having the value of PhysicalIndex (or zero) and
the other having the value of hrSWInstalledIndex (or zero).  These
replaced the need for:

     connUnitNumports
     connUnitRevsTable (and all its contents)
     connUnitNumRevs
     connUnitPortRevision
     connUnitPortVendor
     connUnitProduct
     connUnitInfo
     connUnitSn
     connUnitModuleId
     connUnitVendorId
     connUnitDeletedTrap

12.2.5.  Removal of revision numbers

The forward/backward compatibility rules of how to evolve MIBs are
designed such that MIBs do not have revision numbers.  This removed the
need for:

     revisionNumber

12.2.6.  Removal of other not FC-specific information

Other information was removed because it was not specific to Fibre
Channel:

     systemURL
     statusChangeTime
     configurationChangeTime
     connUnitUrl
     connUnitUpTime
     connUnitState
     connUnitContact
     connUnitLocation
     connUnitProxyMaster
     connUnitControl
     connUnitStatus

     connUnitStatusChange

12.2.7.  Clean-up of ambiguous/obsolete definitions

Some information in the FC Management integration was obsolete or
ambiguous:

     statusChangeTime (obsolete)
     configurationChangeTime (obsolete)
     connUnitTableChangeTime (obsolete)
     connUnitStatusChangeTime (obsolete)
     connUnitConfigurationChangeTime (obsolete)
     connUnitNumZones (obsolete)
     connUnitZoneTable (referenced but not defined)
     connUnitLinkCurrIndex (badly defined)

12.2.8.  Use of an ifTable entry

The following objects were removed because they duplicated existing IF-
MIB objects:

12.2.9.  Removed because of AgentX difficulty

An AgentX environment [RFC2741] consists of a master agent and several
sub-agents.  It is not difficult to implement the same MIB in several
such sub-agents if all of the MIB's tables have a common index variable
as the first auxiliary object in their INDEX clauses.  However, any
scalars which the MIB contains pose a problem for the AgentX
environment.  All the (remaining) scalars were therefore removed:

     revisionNumber
     uNumber
     systemURL

12.2.10.  FC Management Instance

The term "connectivity unit" was changed to "FC management instance".

The term "connectivity unit" was not properly defined in draft-ietf-
ipfc-fcmgmt-int-mib-07.txt, and its usage provided a confused mixture of
indications to the implementor:

- the definition of FcUnitType suggested it was functional;
- the definition of uNumber suggested it was physical;
- the definition of connUnitProduct suggested it was a vendor's product;
- etc.

The common implementation strategy for "connectivity unit" was whatever
grouping was easiest in providing access to the management
functionality.  (One such grouping accommodates a single SNMP agent
having multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, each supporting a separate
implementation of the MIB.)

In fact, this scenario is not new; in practice, a "connectivity unit"
will have the same semantics as a management "instance" in other MIBs,
e.g., the IPS WG's own iSCSI MIB.  For this MIB, its meaning is: "a
separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality".  Given this

definition, then "FC management instance" is a better name because it is
more accurate and more representative of the definition, than is
"connectivity unit".

12.2.11.  Counter Syntax

All packet and octet counters have been changed to be Counter64's (but
Counter32 versions of them are also included for use by old agents).
The error counters have been changed to Counter32's.  (In the probably
impossible, and at most improbable, circumstances that the rate of
occurrence of errors, even on a 10Gbs Fibre Channel interface, might
wrap faster than a hour, the fact that errors are occurring will almost
certainly be apparent from other MIB objects.)

12.2.12.  Obsolete/Little-Used Fibre Channel features

Information relating to Fibre Channel features which are obsolete or not
widely-implemented has been deleted.  (For more information, see section
6.2.1 and section 6.2.2 of [FC-MI].)

     - Class 1 service,
     - Intermix Mode,
     - Stacked Conn Mode.
     - PH version numbers

Note that with support for Class 1 service being deleted, only class 2
now needs F_BSY, F_RJT, P_BSY and P_RJT counters, and thus they no
longer need to be counted for all classes as well as for class 2, and
therefore these objects:

     connUnitPortStatCountFBSYFrames
     connUnitPortStatCountPBSYFrames
     connUnitPortStatCountFRJTFrames
     connUnitPortStatCountPRJTFrames

have been deleted.

12.3.  Name Server objects

A table of Name Server information was present in draft-ietf-ipfc-
fcmgmt-int-mib-07.txt.  That information is not currently represented in
this MIB, because this MIB is already quite large, and a set of Name
Server objects are expected to be defined in a separate (new) MIB.

13.  Comparison to RFC 2837

This MIB is a superset of RFC 2837, except for the following:

     - the fcFeClass1AccountingGroup group is obsolete,
     - fcFxPortConnectedNxPort, fcFxPortFcphVersionHigh,
       fcFxPortFcphVersionLow, fcFxPortFcphVersionAgreed,
       fcFxPortStackedConnModeAgreed, fcFxPortIntermixSuppAgreed,
       fcFxPortCapStackedConnMode and fcFxPortCapIntermix are obsolete,
     - fcFxPortBbCredit and fcFxPortRxBufSize are per attached Nx_Port,
     - fcFxPortBbCreditAvailable is ephemeral,
     - fcFeModuleTable is mostly contained in the entPhysicalTable,
     - fcFxPortPhysAdminStatus, fcFxPortPhysOperStatus, and
       fcFxPortPhysLastChange have equivalents in the ifTable.
