Internet-Draft              DHCPv4 PAA Option               October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA)
   [1] defines a new Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) lower
   layer that uses IP between the protocol end points.

   The PANA protocol is run between a PANA Client (PaC) and a PANA
   Authentication Agent (PAA) in order to perform authentication and
   authorization for the network access service.

   This document specifies a new DHCPv4 option [2] that allows PANA
   client (PaC) to discover PANA Authentication Agents (PAA).  This is
   one of the many methods for locating PAAs: manual configuration is an
   example of another one.

Internet-Draft              DHCPv4 PAA Option               October 2005


5.  PANA Authentication Agent DHCPv4 Option

   This document defines a DHCPv4 option that carries either a 32-bit
   (binary) IPv4 address list or, preferably, a domain name list to be
   used by the PANA client to locate a PANA authentication Agent.

   The option has two encodings, specified by the encoding byte ('enc')
   that follows the code byte.  If the encoding byte has the value 0, it
   is followed by a list of domain names, as described below (Section
   5.1).  If the encoding byte has the value 1, it is followed by one or
   more IPv4 addresses (Section 5.2).  All implementations MUST support
   both encodings.  The 'option-length' field indicates the total number
   of octets in the option following the 'option-length' field,
   including the encoding byte.

5.1.  PANA Authentication Agent Domain Name List

   If the 'enc' byte has a value of 0, the encoding byte is followed by
   a sequence of labels, encoded according to Section 3.1 of RFC 1035
   [5], quoted below:

      Domain names in messages are expressed in terms of a sequence of
      labels.  Each label is represented as a one octet length field
      followed by that number of octets.  Since every domain name ends
      with the null label of the root, a domain name is terminated by a
      length byte of zero.  The high order two bits of every length
      octet must be zero, and the remaining six bits of the length field
      limit the label to 63 octets or less.  To simplify
      implementations, the total length of a domain name (i.e., label
      octets and label length octets) is restricted to 255 octets or
      less.

   RFC 1035 encoding was chosen to accommodate future internationalized
   domain name mechanisms.

   The option MAY contain multiple domain names, but these SHOULD refer
   to different NAPTR records, rather than different A records.  Domain
   names MUST be listed in order of preference.

   Use of multiple domain names is not meant to replace NAPTR and SRV
   records, but rather to allow a single DHCPv4 server to indicate
   multiple PANA Authentication Agents available in the same access
   network.

   Clients MUST support compression according to the encoding in Section
   4.1.4 of [5].

   If the length of the domain list exceeds the maximum permissible

   within a single option (254 octets), then the domain list MUST be
   represented in the DHCP message as specified in [6].

   The DHCPv4 option for this encoding has the format shown in Fig. 1.

   0                   1                   2                   3

      Agents for the client to use.  The domain names are encoded
      according to Section 3.1 of RFC 1035 [5].

5.2.  PANA Authentication Agent IPv4 Address List

   If the 'enc' byte has a value of 1, the encoding byte is followed by
   a list of IPv4 addresses indicating one or more PANA Authentication
   Agents available to the PANA client.  PAAs MUST be listed in order of
   preference.

   The DHCPv4 option for this encoding has the format shown in Fig. 2.

6.  Client Operation

   The client requests PAA DHCPv4 Option in a Parameter Request List as
   described in [2] and [3].

   If the PAA DHCPv4 option provided in response by the DHCPv4 server
   contains multiple domain names, the client MUST try the records in
   the order listed.  The client only resolves the subsequent domain
   names if attempts to contact the first one failed or denote a domain
   administratively prohibited by client policy.

   If the PAA DHCPv4 option provided in response by the DHCPv4 server
   contains multiple IP addresses, the client MUST try the records in
   the order listed.

7.  DHCPv4 Server Operation

   If a DHCPv4 server is configured with both PAA domain name list and
   PAA IP address list, the DHCPv4 server should responds to the request
   with the domain name list to be used by the PANA client.

   A DHCP server MUST NOT mix the two list types (domain names and IPv4
   address) in the same DHCPv4 message, even if it sends two different
   instances of the same option.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [1] and [2] apply.  If an adversary
   manages to modify the response from a DHCP server or insert its own
   response, a PANA Client could be led to contact a rogue PANA Agent,
   possibly one that then intercepts call requests or denies service.

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA assignment for the following DHCPv4 option code is needed.

   Option  Name                 Value

   OPTION_PAA_AGENT              TBD
