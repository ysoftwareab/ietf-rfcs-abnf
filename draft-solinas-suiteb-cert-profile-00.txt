1. Introduction

   This document specifies a base profile for X.509v3 Certificates and
   Certificate Revocation Lists for use by implementations of Transport 
   Layer Security (TLSv1.2), IPsec Internet Key Exchange (IKEv1 and 
   IKEv2), S/MIME, Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) and Secure Shell 
   (SSH) which support the United States National Security Agency's 
   (NSA) Suite B Cryptography.  This profile is also applicable to 
   protocols under revision in the international standards environment 
   which will incorporate suite B cryptography, such as XML Encryption 
   or XML Signature.








Solinas, Zieglar                                                      [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Suite B Certificate and CRL Profile      December 2008


   This Suite B certificate and CRL profile complements [RFC5280].  If 
   a specific program needs to implement a subset of the Suite B
   certificate and CRL profile, the program should tailor its X.509
   certificate and CRL profile using the parameters stipulated in this
   document together with the parameters stipulated in [RFC5280].

   Parameters stipulated in this document should take precedence.  When
   "no specific requirements" is stated for a particular field or 
   extension in this profile, then no specific requirements apply except
   for those stated by [RFC5280].  In case of discrepancies between the
   present profile and [RFC5280], the present document is the normative
   one for Suite B.

   The format is applicable to the following Suite B certificate and CRL
   types:

      *  Root Certification Authority (CA) Self-Signed Certificate 
         using P-256 signed with P-256
      *  Root CA Self-Signed Certificate using P-384 signed with P-384
      *  Subordinate CA Certificate using P-256 signed with P-256
      *  Subordinate CA Certificate using P-384 signed with P-384
      *  Subordinate CA Certificate using P-256 signed with P-384
      *  CA Cross-Certificate using P-256 signed with P-256
      *  CA Cross-Certificate using P-384 signed with P-384
      *  CA Cross-Certificate using P-256 signed with P-384
      *  End-Entity Signature Certificate using P-256 signed with P-256
      *  End-Entity Signature Certificate using P-384 signed with P-384
      *  End-Entity Signature Certificate using P-256 signed with P-384
      *  End-Entity Key Establishment Certificate using P-256 signed
         with P-256
      *  End-Entity Key Establishment Certificate using P-384 signed 
         with P-384
      *  End-Entity Key Establishment Certificate using P-256 signed
         with P-384
      *  CRL signed with P-256
      *  CRL signed with P-384

   This document does not address implementation requirements.  It does
   not address requirements on the use of specific protocols, equipment,
   or key strength levels to protect information with specific
   sensitivity levels and/or in specific threat environments. 

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

INTERNET-DRAFT    Suite B Certificate and CRL Profile      December 2008


3. Requirements and Assumptions

   The goal of this document is to define a base set of certificate and
   CRL formats to support interoperability between distinct Suite B
   solutions.  Specific communities, such as the US National Security 
   Systems, may define community profiles which further restrict
   certificate and CRL formats by mandating the presence of extensions
   which are optional in this base profile, defining new optional, or
   critical extension types, or restricting the values and/or presence
   of fields within existing extensions.  However, communications 
   between distinct communities must use the formats specified in this
   document when interoperability is desired.  (Applications may add
   additional non-critical extensions to these formats but they must 
   not assume that a remote peer will be able to process them.)

   In most applications, performance, scalability, and cost will 
   require the infrastructure to delegate reponsibility for generating
   end-entity key pairs to the nodes themselves.  With the 
   end-entities performing the key generation, the infrastructure is 
   only required to support X.509v3 certificate issuance and signing 
   functions.  When necessary, key pairs may be generated centrally by 
   the infrastructure.  The infrastructure is responsible for 
   revocation, protection of centrally generated private keys, and 
   other certificate management functions. In either key generation 
   model, the format of the Suite B certificates shall remain as 
   specified in this document.

   This Suite B certificate and CRL profile complements [RFC5280].  
   If a specific program needs to implement s subset of the Suite B 
   certificate and CRL profile, the program should tailor its X.509
   certificate and CRL profile using the parameters stipulated in this
   document together with the parameters stipulated in [RFC5280]. 
   Parameters stipulated in this document should take precedence. 
   When "no specific requirements" is stated for a particular field or
   extension in this profile, then no specific requirements apply 
   except for those stated by [RFC5280].  In case of discrepancies 
   between the present profile and [RFC5280], the present document is
   the normative one for Suite B.

3.1 Implementing Suite B

   Every Suite B certificate must use the X.509v3 format, and contain
   either:

      * An ECDSA capable signing key, using group P-256 or P-384; or
      * An ECDH capable key establishment key, using group P-256 or
        P-384.




Solinas, Zieglar                                                      [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Suite B Certificate and CRL Profile      December 2008


   Every Suite B certificate and CRL must be signed using ECDSA.  The
   signing CA's key must be on the group P-256 or P-384 if the
   certificate contains a key on the group P-256.  If the certificate
   contains a key on the group P-384, the signing CA's key must be on
   the group P-384.  Any certificate must be hashed using SHA256 or
   SHA384, matched to the size of the signing CA's key.

   Compliant Suite B implementations that use an ECDSA signing key or
   static ECDH key must be compatible with issuing certificate requests
   and resolving certificate responses.  The preferred protocol is
   [RFC5272], Certificate Management Messages over CMS (CMC).  The 
   infrastructure supporting Suite B must be capable of issuing X.509v3
   certificates and CRLs, signed with ECDSA with the appropriate P-256
   or P-384 curve.

3.2 Commercial Protocols

   The following sections provide guidance for the use of Suite B
   cryptography in commercial protocols.

3.2.1 Transport Layer Security (TLS)

   Suite B TLS implementations should reference Internet-Draft
   "Suite B Profile for Transport Layer Security (TLS)", dated
   December 17, 2008 (draft-rescorla-tls-suiteb-11.txt).

   TLS utilizes ECDHE (ephemeral) and ECDSA (with P-256 or P-384) 
   [SuiteBTLS]. The ECDH key exchange is Ephemeral-Ephemeral (E-E)
   with the server supplying a certificate containing an ECDSA key,
   signed with ECDSA.  At a minimum, ECDHE-ECDSA (with P-256) should
   be implemented.

   If the client is to be authenticated, it must acquire an X.509v3 
   certificate containing an ECDSA key, signed with ECDSA to be used
   in TLS exchanges.  Note that the TLS protocol would indicate the
   server sent a request for a certificate type "ECDSA_sign". Clients
   in a Suite B TLS exchange never require static key establishment
   keys.

3.2.2. Internet Key Exchange (IKE)

   Suite B IKE implementations MUST follow [RFC4869].




Solinas, Zieglar                                                      [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Suite B Certificate and CRL Profile      December 2008

   IKE shared secrets always involve E-E Diffie-Hellman (DH) key 
   exchange, so there are no static ECDH keys in this protocol. 
   Authentication via public key will require an ECDSA capable 
   certificate.  These will be X.509v3 certificates containing a key
   from the Suite B elliptic curve P-256 or P-384, and signed with ECDSA.

3.2.3 S/MIME

   Suite B S/MIME implementations MUST follow [RFC5008].

   Suite B key establishment in S/MIME uses an ECDH key establishment
   key and an ECDSA signing key, both signed using ECDSA.  The ECDH
   involves E-S using P-256 or P-384 curves. Any message peer in a Suite
   B compliant S/MIME environment must have an ECDH X.509v3 certificate,
   signed with ECDSA.

   Some current RSA-based implementations of S/MIME certificates contain
   a key with key usage extension bits set for both key establishment
   and signing.  Suite B implementations are not permitted to use a 
   single certificate for multiple key usages.

3.2.4 Secure Shell (SSH)

   Suite B implementations of SSH should reference Internet-Draft 
   "Suite B Cryptographic Suites for Secure Shell", dated September 
   2008 (draft-igoe-secsh-suiteb-00.txt).

   In the SSH environment, ECDH is always E-E, with the server 
   authentication to the client using ECDSA.  Therefore the only
   certificate required to support SSH contains an ECDSA key, signed
   with ECDSA.  

4. Suite B X.509 Certificate and Certificate Extensions Profile 

   [RFC5280] describes the basic structure of an X.509 version 3
   certificate and CRL, and provides a provfile to faciliate the use of
   X.509 certificates and CRLs within the Internet community for various
   applications such as WWW (TLS), electronic email (S/MIME), and IPSec.

   This Suite B certificate and CRL profile complements [RFC5280].  
   As previously stated, programs that need to be interoperable or 
   compatible with Suite B should tailor their X.509 certificate and CRL
   profile using the parameters stipulated in this document together 
   with the parameters stipulated in [RFC5280].  Parameters in this 
   document take precedence over those in [RFC 5280].  If "no specific
   requirements" are stated for a particular field in this document, 
   then those in [RFC5280] apply.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Suite B Certificate and CRL Profile      December 2008


4.1. Basic Certificate Fields

   The basic X.509v3 certificate syntax is as follows from [RFC5280]:

   Certificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
      tbsCertificate       TBSCertificate,
      signatureAlgorithm   AlgorithmIdentifier,
      signatureValue       BIT STRING  }

   TBSCertificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
      version           [0]   EXPLICIT Version DEFAULT v1,
      serialNumber            CertificateSerialNumber,
      signature               AlgorithmIdentifier,
      issuer                  Name,
      validity                Validity,
      subject                 Name,
      subjectPublicKeyInfo    SubjectPublicKeyInfo,
      issuerUniqueID    [1]   IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL
                              --If present, version MUST be v2 or v3
      subjectUniqueID   [2]   IMPLICIT UniqueIdentifier OPTIONAL
                              --If present, version MUST be v2 or v3
   Extensions           [3]   EXPLICIT Extensions OPTIONAL
                              --If present, version MUST be v3
   }

4.1.1. Certificate Fields

   Certificate is REQUIRED and MUST include the three fields:
   tbsCertificate, signatureAlgorithm, and signatureValue, as specified
   in [RFC5280].  Further requirements for these fields for Suite B 
   follows:

4.1.1.1. tbsCertificate

   The tbsCertificate field contains the names of the subject and issuer, 
   a public key associated with the subject, a validity period, and other 
   associated information.  The fields are described in detail in 
   Section 4.1.2 of this document, and Section 4.1.2 of [RFC5280].

4.1.1.2. signatureAlgorithm

   The signatureAlgorithm field contains the identifier for the
   cryptographic algorithm used by the CA to sign this certificate per
   [RFC5280], Section 4.1.1.2.  The two algorithm identifiers used by
   Suite B are ecdsa-with-SHA256 and ecdsa-with-SHA384 per [X9.62],
   Section E.8.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Suite B Certificate and CRL Profile      December 2008


4.1.1.3. signatureValue

   The signatureValue field, for Suite B Certificates, contains a
   digital signature computed upon the ASN.1 DER encoded tbsCertificate
   [RFC5280], Section 4.1.1.3.  The ECDSA digital signature MUST be
   used for Suite B certificates [X9.62], Section 7.  The ECDSA
   signature value is comprised of two unsigned integers, denoted r and
   s.  However, ASN.1 encoding of INTEGER is used to represent r and s
   in the signatureValue field.  If the high order bit of the unsigned
   integer is a 1, a byte with value 0x00 must be prepended to the 
   binary representation before encoding it as an ASN.1 INTEGER. 
   Unsigned integers for the P-256 and P-384 curves can be a maximum of
   32 and 48 bytes, respectively.  Therefore converting to an ASN.1
   INTEGER will mean a maximum of 33 bytes for the P-256 curve and 49
   bytes for the P-384 curve.

   The ECDSA signatureValue is encoded as a BIT STRING value of a DER
   encoded SEQUENCE of the two INTEGERS, and stored in the 
   signatureValue field of the Certificate.

4.1.2. TBSCertificate

   As stated in [RFC5280], TBSCertificate contains information
   associated with the subject of the certificate and the CA that issued
   it.  The fields are described in detail as follows and in [RFC5280].

4.1.2.1. Version

   Version is REQUIRED and MUST be set to 2 to denote X.509 version 3
   public key certificates [RFC5280], Section 4.1.2.1.

4.1.2.2. SerialNumber

   SerialNumber is REQUIRED and MUST follow [RFC5280], Section 4.1.2.2.

4.1.2.3. Signature

   Signature is REQUIRED and contains an algorithm identifier to denote
   the algorithm used by the issuer to sign the certficate.  The two
   algorithm identifers used by Suite B are ecdsa-with-SHA256 and
   ecdsa-with-SHA384 [X9.62], Section E.8.

4.1.2.4. Issuer

   Issuer is REQUIRED and MUST follow [RFC5280], Section 4.1.2.4.

4.1.2.5. Validity

   Validity is required and MUST follow [RFC5280], Section 4.1.2.5.



Solinas, Zieglar                                                      [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Suite B Certificate and CRL Profile      December 2008


4.1.2.6. Subject

   Subject is REQUIRED and MUST follow [RFC5280], Section 4.1.2.6.

4.1.2.7. SubjectPublicKeyInfo

   SubjectPublicKeyInfo is REQUIRED and MUST follow [RFC5280], Section
   4.1.2.7.  SubjectPublicKeyInfo will contain the Elliptic Curve 
   public key and usually the algorithm with which the key is used. 
   The following conditions apply:

      * For ECDSA signing keys, the algorithm ID, id-ecPublicKey, MUST
        be used, indicating unrestricted algorithm usage of the public
        key [RFC3279], Section 2.3.5.
      * For ECDH key establishment keys, the algorithm ID, 
        id-ecPublicKey, MUST be supported.  The algorithm ID, id-ecDH, 
        MAY be supported, [DRAFT3279bis], Section 2.1.
      * The intended application for the pulbic key is indicated in the
        key usage extension that is described in Section 4.2.3.1 of this
        document.
      * The parameters of the AlgorithmIdentifier of the 
        subjectPublicKeyInfo MUST use the namedCurve option; the 
        ecParameters and implicitlyCA options MUST NOT be used 
        [RFC3279], Section 2.3.5.
      * The namedCurve MUST be either the OID for secp256r1 (P-256 
        curve) or secp384r1 (P-384 curve) [SEC2], Section A.2.1.  The
        elliptic curve public key, ECPoint, SHALL be the octet string
        representation of an elliptic curve point following the 
        conversion routine in [X9.63], Section 4.3.6, and [RFC3279],
        Section 2.3.5.
      * Suite B implementations MUST support the uncompressed form of
        the elliptic curve point [X9.63], Section 4.3.6.  Suite B
        certificates MAY suppport the compressed form of the elliptic
        curve point [x9.63], Section 4.3.6.  
      * The elliptic curve public key (an ECPoint which is an OCTET
        STRING) is mapped to a subjectPublicKey (a BIT STRING) as 
        follows:  the most significant bit of the OCTET STRING becomes
        the most significant bit of the BIT STRING and the least 
        significant bit of the OCTET STRING becomes the least 
        significant bit of the BIT STRING [RFC3279], Section 2.3.5.

4.1.2.8. Unique Identifiers

   IssuerUniqueID and SubjectUniqueID MUST NOT be used in Suite B
   certificates [RFC5280], Section 4.1.2.8.

   CertifiateList is REQUIRED and MUST include the three fields:
   tbsCertList, signatureAlgorithm, and signatureValue. 

5.1. CRL Fields

   Suite B CRL fields are described as follows:

5.1.1. TBSCertList Fields

   TBSCertList fields are described as follows:

5.1.1.1. Version

   Version is REQUIRED and MUST be set to 1 to denote version 2 CRLs per
   [RFC5280], Section 5.1.2.1.

5.1.1.2. Signature
   
   Signature is REQUIRED and contains an algorithm identifer to denote 
   the algorithm used by the issuer to sign the CRL.  The two algorithm

INTERNET-DRAFT    Suite B Certificate and CRL Profile      December 2008


5.1.1.5. NextUpdate

   NextUpdate follows [RFC5280] and indicates the date by which the 
   next CRL will be issued [RFC5280], Section 5.1.2.5.

5.1.1.6. RevokedCertificates

   RevokedCertificates follows [RFC5280], Section 5.1.2.6.

5.1.2. SignatureAlgorithm and SignatureValue Fields

   The signatureAlgorithm and signatureValue fields of the Suite B
   CRL follow the previous description for these fields in the X.509
   Suite B Certificate Profile, Sections 4.1.1.2 and 4.1.1.3 of this
   document.

   The signatureAlgorithm and signatureValue fields in the 
   Certificate and CertificateList sequences, the signature and
   subjectPublicKeyInfo in the TBSCertificate subcomponent, and the
   signature in the TBSCertList subcomponent MUST identify Suite B
   through the use of algorithm identifiers.
   The primary OID structure for Suite B is as follows [X9.62],
   [SEC2], [RFC3279], and [RFC5280].

      ansi-X9-62	OID::={iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) 10045}
      certicom-arc	OID::={iso(1) identified-organization(3)
                               certicom(132)}
      
      id-ecPublicKey	OID::={ansi-X9.62 keyType(2) 1}
      id-ecDh		OID::={certicom-arc schemes(1) ecdh(12)}

      secp256r1		OID::={ansi-X9-62 signatures(4)}
      secp384r1		OID::={certiciom-arc curve(0) 34}

      id-ecSigType	OID::={ansi X9.62 signatures(4)}
      ecdsa-with-SHA256	OID::={id-ecSigType specified(3) 2}
      ecdsa-with-SHA384	OID::={id-ecSigType specified(3) 3}

5.2 CRL Extensions

   CrlExtensions MUST include the authority key identifier and the
   CRL Number extensions [RFC5280], Section 5.2.










Solinas, Zieglar                                                     [Page 16]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Suite B Certificate and CRL Profile      December 2008


   In particular,

      * The authorityKeyIdentifier extension MUST be marked as 
        non-critical and MUST use the keyIdentifier field [RFC5280],
        Section 5.2.1. The value of the keyIdentifier field will be
        computed following the guidance in [RFC5280], Section 4.2.1.1.
      * The crlNumber extension MUST be marked as non-critical and 
        follows [RFC5280], Section 5.2.3.

   All extensions not described in this profile should be considered
   OPTIONAL; their inclusion or exclusion and their values will depend
   on the particular application or environment incorporating this
   Suite B Certificate and CRL profile as a base.
      
6. Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC5280] and [DRAFT3279bis] apply.

   A single key pair MUST NOT be used for both signature and key
   establishment.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document makes extensive use of object identifiers to register
   public key types, elliptic curves, and algorithms.  Most are 
   registered in the ANSI X9.62 arc with the exception of some of the
   curves, which are in the Certicom, Inc. arc (these curves have been
   adopeted by ANSI and NIST). Extensions in certificates and CRLs are
   identified using the object identifiers defined in an arc delegated
   by IANA to the PKIX working group. No further action by IANA is
   necessary for this document or any anticipated updates.
