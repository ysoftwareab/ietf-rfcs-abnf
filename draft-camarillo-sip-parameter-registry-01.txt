STATUS OF THIS MEMO

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that
   other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-
   Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress".

Abstract

   This document creates an IANA registry for SIP header field
   parameters. It also lists the already existing parameters to be used
   as initial values for that registry.

1 Introduction

   RFC3261 [1] allows new header field parameters to be defined.
   However, RFC3261 omitted an IANA registry for them. This document
   creates such a registry.

2 Use of the Registry

   Both RFC defined and proprietary header field parameters MUST be
   registered with IANA as described below.

        Note that this includes header field parameters for P-
        headers.

3 IANA Considerations

   Section 27 of RFC 3261 [1] creates an IANA registry for method names,
   header field names, warning codes, status codes, and option tags.
   This specification instructs the IANA to create two a new sub-
   registry under http://www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters:

        o Header Field Parameters

3.1 Header Field Parameters Sub-Registry

   The majority of the SIP header fields can be extended by defining new
   parameters. New SIP header field parameters are registered by the
   IANA. When registering a new parameter for a header field, the
   following information MUST be provided.

        o Header field in which the parameter can appear.

        o Name of the parameter.

        o For proprietary parameters, a brief description of its
          semantics.

        o A reference to a further description, if available. For
          example, (in order of preference) an RFC, a published paper, a
          patent filing, a technical report, documented source code or a
          computer manual.

        o For proprietary parameters, contact information (postal and
          email address).

   Parameters that can appear in different header fields MAY have the
   same name. However, parameters that can appear in the same header
   field MUST have different names.
