1. Overview and disclaimer

   This note addresses routing in chaotic non-engineered radio networks.
   The "chaos" in these networks derives from a combination of device
   motion and interactions with the environment.

   Wireless links are quite susceptible to time varying statistical
   behavior caused by many factors, including the physics of the
   propagation medium, inner city fading characteristics, shadowing
   (e.g., a person walking by a device), potential power control, etc
   induce effects that need addressing even in pseudo-static scenarios.

   Examples of such networks vary from webs of radio-linked sensors
   distributed like seed by air drop, to the behavior of satellites in
   random orbits, to automotive applications in which cars and traffic
   lights are communicating nodes, to military applications such as
   battlefield communications among soldiers, unmanned reconnaissance
   platforms, vehicle-mounted devices, fixed bases, and field
   encampments.

   Such networks have been the subject of significant research over the
   past several years, with numerous routing proposals, and offers to
   re-engineer TCP to make applications operate well in the network.
   The fundamental bent of this note, however, differs from this
   research in intent.  Mobile ad hoc networks, or manets, are not seen
   as networks in their own right any more than local area networks are
   networks in their own right.  Instead, manets are seen as localities
   within networks, much as LANs operate as the local access to a wider
   area Internet.  The operation of manets in isolation is a special
   case of their operation as part of a larger network.

   Taken from this perspective, the important question is not so much
   "please design a routing protocol that will be useful in a manet", as
   it is "please design a routing protocol that will be useful in a
   network that contains one or more manets".

2. IETF History and Work: the MANET Working Group

   The MANET working group was chartered in 1997, to discuss and develop
   solutions for what were described as Mobile Ad Hoc Networks.
   Although it was chartered as an engineering group, one could argue
   that it was then and is now a research organization.  There has been
   little if any commercial activity related to this type of network;
   activity has been focused in the research divisions of various
   companies, notably Nokia, Inria, SRI, Intel, and others, and with
   academic institutions such as UCSB, Rice, and so on.

2.1 Problem Statement

   The problem statement that the MANET working group was given, which
   may be found at http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/manet-charter.html,
   says:


       A "mobile ad hoc network" (MANET) is an autonomous system of
       mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by wireless
       links--the union of which form an arbitrary graph. The routers
       are free to move randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily;
       thus, the network's wireless topology may change rapidly and
       unpredictably. Such a network may operate in a standalone
       fashion, or may be connected to the larger Internet.

       The primary focus of the working group is to develop and
       evolve MANET routing specification(s) and introduce them to
       the Internet Standards track. The goal is to support networks
       scaling up to hundreds of routers. If this proves successful,
       future work may include development of other protocols to
       support additional routing functionality. The working group
       will also serve as a meeting place and forum for those
       developing and experimenting with MANET approaches.

       The working group will examine related security issues around
       MANET. It will consider the intended usage environments, and
       the threats that are (or are not) meaningful within that
       environment.


   In general, a MANET network is very similar to any other Internet
   technology; one researcher, in a discussion of how to manage low
   signal-to-noise ratio channels, ruefully remarked that the
   researchers in the area frequently find themselves re-inventing
   wheels.  Where it differs from standard routing, however, is the
   structure and characteristics of a low-power radio network.

   As an example of the kind of interesting radio environment that can
   exist, consider the sad case of Alice, Bob, and Carol in figure 1.
   An environmental obstacle separates Alice and Bob, so their radios
   cannot "hear" each other, but Carol can "hear" them both quite well,
   as long as they do not happen to "speak" at the same time.  Carol can
   interconnect them by repeating their messages; they might also be
   able to correct the problem by taking a few steps or lifting their
   radios - anything that would obviate the obstacle.  Clearly, these
   devices are in close physical proximity, but their views of the
   network are very different, and their ability to use it differ
   markedly as well.  As they move, or as their environment changes
   around them, this view of the network will also change - often
   appearing to change randomly.

   Figure 1: Varying views in a radio network

2.1.1 Neighbor sets

   Unlike wired networks, each device in a radio network has a slightly
   different view of its world.  From the router's perspective, a LAN is
   an essentially fixed set of routing neighbors, which changes only on
   administrative action, with additional end systems, which may come
   and go.  It is therefore rational and desirable to have the routers
   elect one among them to perform coordination tasks - what is called a
   "designated router" in OSPF and IS-IS.  In a MANET, however, any
   system might be called upon to relay traffic for others.

   Signal quality between a wireless transmission source and a receiver,
   usually measured as a signal-to-noise ratio, can be a difficult to
   model and quantify.  Although there are simple propagation models for
   ideal conditions that are represented by deterministic equations
   (e.g., free space ~1/r^2 and log distance path models ~1/r^n), the

Internet-Draft                  Document                      March 2002


   complex mechanism of electromagnetic wave propagation can be
   attributed to reflection, diffraction, and scattering effects.  Many
   mobile radio systems will operate in urban areas or within buildings
   where time varying signal fading and shadowing effects may naturally
   occur.  Thus, real world propagation effects often result in a time
   varying function for received signal power from a source.  These real
   world physics effects make signal strength prediction and short-term
   estimation of link quality more complex.

   Since systems are in different locations, each system may have a
   different set of neighbors that it is able to communicate effectively
   with, which overlay each other haphazardly.  For this reason, the
   rules that allow OSPF to reduce its flooding statistics from an
   exponential to linear behavior by electing a designated router to
   perform the job are unusable in a radio network.

2.1.2 Random Interconnection Topology

   Another issue is the aspect of mobility, which is different from what
   has traditionally been termed "IP mobility".  The concept in IP
   Mobility is that a device has a normal home in some topological part
   of a stable network, as indicated by its address, but may temporarily
   move somewhere else.  That "address" then becomes something more like
   a name.  A home agent translates it into a second address, which
   represents the device's current actual topological location, and the
   packet stream is forwarded there.  The device may then advise its
   correspondent of its current topological "care-of" address,
   facilitating more direct routing.  In a MANET, the address is tied to
   the device, not a topological location, as there is no fixed network
   infrastructure.  When the addressed device moves, therefore, the
   motion changes the routing infrastructure.  There is no question of
   the correspondent transmitting to the new care-of address, or of a
   home agent forwarding traffic from "the right place" to "somewhere
   else" along a dog-leg path; standard routing will get the packets
   there as a direct outcome as routing tracks the motion of the device.

   Mobility is not an aspect of all MANETs; some varieties of sensor
   networks (such as forest fire sensors scattered by airdrop in the
   region of a fire) can be expected to be stationary once deployed.
   However, even in this case, topological relationships are arbitrary
   and unengineered.  In applications where node mobility is in view, it
   can be haphazard, and in extreme cases can result in entire networks
   randomly partitioning and joining together.

   The fundamental behavior of a manet is that a routing node carries
   with it an address or address prefix, and when it moves, it moves the
   actual address.  When this happens, routing must be recalculated in
   accordance with the new topology.

Internet-Draft                  Document                      March 2002


   This has ramifications for such normal behaviors as autoconfiguration
   of address prefixes and router IDs, which can be replicated in
   separate networks and will require resolution when they join.  It
   also has ramifications for movement among what OSPF or IS-IS would
   call "areas"; if an address is "known" to be someplace and suddenly
   pops up somewhere else, it will need to change areas as well.

   IP Mobility solves an issue in addressing caused by temporary
   mobility; MANET routing solves a routing problem in a network where
   mobility is normal.  When mobility is solved using routing,
   addressing-based solutions are irrelevant.

2.1.3 Radio issues

   The IEEE 802.11 radio networks that typically connect research manets
   have all of the radios on the same frequency, using a Carrier Sense
   Multiple Access (CSMA) discipline.  In other words, if the receiver
   can tell that someone else is transmitting, it may attempt to not
   interrupt, but there is no guarantee that it will be able to sense
   collisions.  In such cases, since all radios use the same frequency
   and spread spectrum patterns, the transmitters effectively jam each
   other.

   One could imagine solving that using disciplines similar to that used
   in LDDI, wherein each system has a sequence number and transmissions
   are made in that order, to generate a form of Slotted ALOHA.  What
   many of the MANET routing protocols are doing, though, is finding
   reasons to not have correlated reasons to transmit, such as
   acknowledging multicast messages, and relying then on randomization
   to evade the problem.  Past research on such approaches suggests that
   it is helpful, but introduces complexities of its own as well.

   There are, of course, other varieties of radios.  Military radios may
   use Code Division Multiple Access (Spread Spectrum CDMA) or Time
   Division Multiplexing (TDMA) disciplines.

2.1.4 Convergence Requirements

   Internet routing protocols, such as RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP, have
   always been developed on the assumption that networks proceed from a
   converged state to a converged state through epochal transitions such
   as changes to router configurations, loss or restoration of links, or
   loss or restoration of routers.  For this reason, instability in
   networks is viewed with some alarm.  OSPF and IS-IS were developed in
   large part because it was increasingly observed that existing
   distance-vector IGPs displayed unacceptably long convergence
   intervals or were not sufficiently resilient.  The increased
   expressiveness of what were then called "variable length subnets",



Baker                  Expires September 15, 2002               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                  Document                      March 2002


   and are now called Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) was also a
   significant factor.  At this time, concern is raised in many quarters
   because the BGP4+ backbone displays significant instability and long
   convergence intervals.

   MANET networks display exactly the opposite characteristic: due to
   node mobility and constantly changing neighbor interconnectivity, the
   network may display episodes in which it converges, but normally is
   in a state of flux.  The question becomes what level of convergence
   is required: is it worthwhile to expend a great deal of effort to
   attempt to maintain a higher level of convergence, or is it better to
   accept partial convergence? The answer to that is not obvious, and
   most likely varies from network to network and application to
   application.

2.1.5 Unidirectional Routing

   Manet research has blown hot and cold on the matter of directional
   routing.

   Common routing protocols depend on bidirectional connectivity.
   Distance Vector protocols, for example, advertise what might be
   considered to be statements that "you can reach [this prefix] with
   [these attributes] via me, on the interface that you receive this
   message on".  OSPF and IS-IS, while not making statements of that
   form, explicitly refuse to use links that lack bidirectional
   connectivity.  They refuse to neighbor, and the SPF implementation
   checks that the far end of a link is reporting bidirectional linkage
   before accepting the extension of a route.

   In a manet network, as previously discussed, a given relationship can
   be unidirectional.  System A may be able to "hear" system B, but B
   not "hear" A, and it may make operational sense to allow A->B to be
   used as a message forwarding link.  Few if any published protocols do
   this today, but it is raised as a desirable capability in some
   discussions.

   The operational and protocol issues are immense.  For a solution to
   support unidirectional links, either the sender on such a link must
   be sending messages for which it cannot determine whether any given
   target receives them, or it must have another path (perhaps also
   unidirectional) via which it receives routing information that tells
   it of its hearing neighbor.  This fact limits the classes of
   protocols that can be used to deploy such a network, and applications
   that will find such a network useful.  Operationally, the fact that a
   link is bidirectional is often the only way a system can know it is
   working at all.

2.1.6 Solution Approaches

   There are a number of ways to solve these issues, as the number of
   proposals made to the MANET working group attests.  They are commonly
   broken down into two broad classes: reactive protocols, which
   determine what route to use when the route is needed, and proactive
   protocols, that predetermine routes on the assumption that they may
   be needed.

   Reactive protocols follow approaches such as source routing or some
   form of routing on demand.  These are designed with the premises:

   o  Network locality is strong: most active routes are topologically
      local, within one or two hops.

   o  The application can work around occasional routing glitches if
      recovery is expedited

   o  While routing may change continuously in the global sense,
      individual routes generally survive long enough to perform common
      application tasks.

   o  The overhead of searching for a route when it is needed (which may
      take several round trip times) is acceptable.

   o  The ratio of multi-hop routes actively being discovered and
      maintained is small compared to the number of such possible routes
      within a manet area.

   o  Route exploration surges, which result from the movement of
      "keystone" nodes, are at an acceptable level.

   If one accepts these premises, then it is reasonable to assume that
   one will search for paths when they are needed, and save them either
   in the source system or the intervening nodes.

   Proactive protocols generally follow some form of link-state
   algorithm, such as SPF (Dijkstra) or of map-based explicit routing.
   These are designed with the premises:

   o  Network locality is indeterminate; routes of any length may be
      commonly used, or not at all.

   o  The application can work around occasional routing glitches, but
      recovery must be almost immediate.

   o  The constant route changes that happen globally may materially
      affect the correct operation of individual nodes.



Baker                  Expires September 15, 2002               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                  Document                      March 2002


   o  The overhead of calculation and information flooding is
      acceptable, but the overhead of searching is not.

   It is possible to mix the two models as well; a link state database
   could be maintained through the network, but inspected only when it
   changes the routing behavior of a network node known to be relevant
   to a route that is currently in use or a new route is needed.

2.2 Progress of the group

   Since 1997, at least ten protocols have been proposed.  These fall
   into several categories.  Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) is similar in
   many respects to IEEE 802.5 Source Route Bridging.  Ad hoc On-Demand
   Distance Vector (AODV) is a reactive protocol that introduces routing
   state in a network only when needed.  Topology Multicast Reverse Path
   Forwarding (TBRPF) and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) are SPF-
   based protocols, which may be compared to OSPF or IS-IS.  They differ
   from these in operational detail, and in the way they flood routing
   database information.

   Security is an issue that none of these protocols has directly
   addressed, although some general analyses have been floated in the
   working group.  Security flaws exist in many of them, which could be
   exploited; for example, DSR is subject to man-in-the-middle attacks,
   and according to one of the authors has experienced them (in the form
   of a lack of routing robustness when stations move) in field-testing.

   Similarly, scaling is an issue that has been dealt with only on the
   surface.  The stated goal of these protocols is "scaling up to
   hundreds of routers"; whether or not the features that allow this
   level of scaling will in turn enable scaling to thousands or tens of
   thousands of routers remains to be shown.  The difference between
   proactive and reactive protocols is intended to address some issues
   in scaling, with different trade-offs.  A reactive protocol might be
   appropriate in a network where most connectivity is local and non-
   local routes tend to remain fairly stable for the duration of a
   typical session; the router maintains no state that is not in current
   use, and is willing to perform an expensive set-up when it needs non-
   local routing state.  A proactive protocol might be appropriate in
   network in which non-local communications are normal and route
   maintenance must be rapid.  The trade-off is that in a proactive
   protocol, topological turbulence causes nodes to constantly store,
   propagate, and adjust routing information that has no current
   utility.

   Quality of Service (important for voice applications) is also not
   addressed, except in AODV.  There is a draft that describes QoS use
   of the routing protocol, which would have it seek a path in which



Baker                  Expires September 15, 2002               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft                  Document                      March 2002


   certain bandwidth and delay bounds are met, and in which the request
   for a route would fail if its conditions cannot be satisfied.  QoS
   routing is, of course, seen as a research topic by much of the IETF
   community, due to a lack of commercial demand and the difficulty of
   the problem in a destination-routed connectionless network [6][10].

   Distributed address autoconfiguration in manet is non-trivial due to
   the need for multi-hop DAD algorithms.  There have been discussions
   with zeroconf participants to explore possibilities and issues.

   While extending any of these protocols to IPv6 is straightforward, in
   publicly available documents, only AODV has materially addressed
   IPv6.  There are drafts on stateless autoconfiguration of IPv6
   networks in a MANET, but it is independent of the routing protocol,
   and apply to non-routing hosts which neighbor with routers, rather
   than to systems capable of forwarding packets.  OLSR mentions how it
   could be extended to address IPv6.  Likewise, TBRPF states (section
   9.7.2) that


       Transition mechanisms described in the IETF NGTRANS working
       group (e.g. ISATAP) enable IPv6 operation over IPv4 routing
       infrastructures. ISATAP [19] can be used on TBRPF MANETs to
       enable automatic IPv6-in-IPv4 operation regardless of route
       changes due to mobility. Future versions of this draft will
       specify a native IPv6 capability for TBRPF using mechanisms
       similar to those specified in [21]. Packet formats which
       implement such mechanisms will use 4-octet router ID's instead
       of 16-octet IPv6 addresses for greater efficiency.


   DHCP is not mentioned in any posted draft, although there are an
   argument that some form of address assignment protocol adapted to
   MANET networks is required.  IP Mobility is not addressed either.

   An initial requirements document has been published, as RFC 2501 [7].
   DSR and AODV have been proposed to the IESG for publication as
   Experimental RFCs.  No other drafts have been sent to the IESG.

2.3 Probable directions

   The Working Group expects to publish several protocols as
   Experimental, including DSR and AODV, but expect to take one reactive
   and one proactive protocol onto the IETF standards track.  These will
   likely be AODV and OLSR.

   In 1997, the working group chairs asked the authors of OLSR to
   publish their work in the IETF context (although one of the working

Internet-Draft                  Document                      March 2002


   group chairs is the author of a competing proposal), because they
   considered it a well architected solution to the problem.  Although
   some details remain to be worked out, they still consider it among
   the better proposals on the table.

   AODV is likewise a quite workable solution, with an interoperability
   test of as many as fifteen academic implementations scheduled in
   March 2002.  It alone, of the candidates, addresses IPv6 or Quality
   of Service issues.

   TBRPF is interesting, and should work correctly, although the
   operational utility of some of its optimizations may be open to
   question in a given network.  SRI has aggressively marketed TBRPF and
   its IPRs to the working group.  The fact that a patent has been
   applied for on certain aspects is, however, severely limiting
   politically.  If there is any way in which the IETF is absolutely
   predictable, it is that when confronted with a choice between a
   proposal encumbered with IPR issues and an unencumbered proposal, it
   will choose the unencumbered one.

   The other proposals are either not as far along, have encountered

3. Market issues

   From the perspective of the marketplace, at this time there is little
   commercial demand for MANET-style protocols.  This is not an issue in
   the protocols themselves; it is an issue of the applications in which
   they might be used.  While interactive automotive mapping services
   are common in Japan and some European countries, these use direct-
   connect short-reach radio technologies or third generation wireless,
   rather than packet networks.  Sensor networks remain the realm of
   research, and military uses are in research.  As a result, not only
   are we limited by the lack of standards, but by a distinct lack of
   market interest.

   In fairness, when IPv4 was first deployed, there was little
   commercial demand for it, either.  Until the mid-1990's, Novell
   Netware and Apple AppleTalk had more commercial penetration and
   offered superior application features, and IBM SNA absolutely
   controlled the financial services sector.  At this point, while few
   dispute that IPv6 gives more addresses, and therefore is a good
   solution to certain market issues, there is significant dispute that
   markets demand IPv6 deployment.  Dismissing MANET-style routing as
   meeting with little market demand is at best shortsighted.  Rather,
   since it meets some market requirements, the most sensible approach
   is to develop the capability experimentally and see if markets grow
   to depend on it.

4. Protocol Proposals

   For completeness, I will now discuss various possible approaches to
   MANET routing as described in some of the leading protocols.  I will
   first discuss the use of OSPF Version 2 [4]as a MANET protocol, which
   has both issues and opportunities.  I will also discuss the proposals
   that I perceive to be leading in the MANET working group, for
   comparison.

4.1 OSPF Version 2 and IS-IS

   From the perspective of a commercial vendor, the most obvious routing
   protocol to use for any application is one that is already
   implemented.  For this reason, companies like Cisco and many of their
   customers would likely look first to such standard protocols as OSPF,
   IS-IS, or possibly proprietary protocols such as EIGRP, before
   assuming a special purpose protocol is required.  It also serves as a
   point of perspective, defining terms and surfacing issues, which the
   remaining discussion may refer to.  If a workable scenario can be
   found for OSPF or IS-IS in a MANET, interoperation with wired
   internet components, including wired networks within vehicles, wired
   bases, and the internet proper, becomes within the grasp of a MANET
   network, which is one of MANET's clear expectations in its charter.

   IS-IS and OSPF V2 mirror each other in many respects.  Each is an
   SPF-based protocol, which means that link connectivity information is
   advertised by each router in the network and maintained in a database
   by every node.  Routes are then calculated through the network by
   each router separately, but in a consistent manner and using
   consistent information, which results in rapid convergence on a
   usable set of routes.

   The interfaces in an IS-IS or OSPF network fall into four categories:

   o  Local Area Network: A LAN is viewed as a stable and consistent set
      of neighbors with consistent addressing within an address prefix,
      which can use LAN multicast or multicast technology for
      communications.  This permits several optimizations over
      describing them as pairwise point to point connections.

   o  Non-Broadcast Multi-Access: OSPF defines an NBMA interface as a
      special case of a LAN, which does not support a multicast or
      multicast capability.  It is primarily used in Frame Relay and ATM
      networks.

   o  Point to Point: A point-to-point interface is an interface on
      which there are exactly two neighbors.

   o  Point to Multipoint: OSPF defines a Point to Multipoint is a
      grouping of point-to-point relationships over a common interface.
      It is primarily used in Frame Relay and ATM networks.

   Of these types, it will be observed that only two support a multicast
   or multicast capability - the LAN and the Point to Multipoint
   Interface.  The fundamental issue relates to the process of bringing
   up a new routing neighbor.  In an SPF-based routing network, all
   routing databases must be consistent to guarantee consistent results.
   As a result, it is necessary only for a router joining an operational
   network to synchronize with one router in order to obtain that
   database.  The routers on a LAN elect one among them (called the
   "designated router") to perform synchronization tasks; as a result,
   rather than experiencing database flooding traffic on the order of
   the square of the number of routers on the LAN, that traffic is
   linear with the number of routers on the LAN.  Points to point links,
   of course, require no such optimization.

   In the design of OSPF, Frame Relay was originally viewed as being
   much like a LAN, with internal connectivity that need not be visible
   to the routing protocol.  For this reason, Frame Relay was modeled as
   an NBMA network, using a designated router like a LAN to make traffic
   distributions linear.  A problem was discovered in Frame Relay
   networks, however, which used switching equipment that did not
   support dynamic rerouting around failed internal trunks.  In this
   case, a failure of the trunk connecting the designated router and its
   backup (shown in figure 2) would cause a designated router election,
   in which various systems elected different designated routers.
   OSPF's solution to this is to wait for a uniform election result
   before continuing, resulting in a complete failure of routing.

   to-point connections, which was called a point to multipoint network
   interface.  While this is subject to traffic volumes on the order of
   the square of the number of connected routers, the loss of an
   internal trunk does not result in the loss of external connectivity
   unless no connectivity exists.

   In MANET environments, OSPF V2 or IS-IS are likely to encounter a
   number of challenges.  The radio network is a multicast network, so
   it is tempting to think of it as a LAN, perhaps an 802.11 variant.
   However, in this environment several issues immediately result:

   o  When routers with different parameters on an interface, including
      area number or address prefix, find themselves in communication,
      they each assume that the other is misconfigured.  As a result,
      they refuse to accept each other as routing neighbors.

   o  Because each router's view is slightly different, even among
      routers that choose to become neighbors, the designated router
      election has inconsistent and inconclusive results.  While some
      sets of routers may converge on consistent designated router
      choices, the network does not, and routing is not even unstable -
      it is non-existent.

   o  If the router did calculate routes, other routers would understand
      from its advertisement that it was able to deliver traffic
      directly to any router using the same prefix, which would be
      untrue.

   o  Since flooding occurs away from the interface that information is
      received on, the only routers that will receive a given bit of
      routing information will be those within radio range of the
      originating router.

   o  If N routers advertise an LSA among themselves, in the average
      case each will send with a link state update or a link state
      acknowledge to the DR and from the DR to the others, for O(3N)
      messages.

   o  If a multicast link state update is sent, OSPF has each recipient
      respond with a unicast acknowledgement right away.  In a CSMA
      network, this is a recipe for disaster; the various senders have a
      high probability of colliding.  If acknowledgements or
      retransmissions are delayed for a random interval long enough to
      materially reduce the probability of collision, network
      convergence is delayed by the same amount.

   o  Since OSPF uses only provably bidirectional links, unidirectional
      links will be excluded from use.

   The most straightforward repair within the existing specification is
   to consider the MANET to be a point-to-multipoint link, and allocate
   the interface addresses from a single large prefix per area.  In this
   environment, routing through the MANET is straightforward, and the
   other issues are resolved.  However, these issues remain:

   o  A router that is not configured for a certain OSPF area will not
      neighbor with routers in that area.

   o  In a multi-area, should a router change its area but retain the
      same prefix on the radio link, the prefix will appear to be in
      both areas, and devices in those or other areas will have
      incorrect routing to some subset of the addresses in that prefix.

   o  Link state updates can be multicast, but the acknowledgements are
      unicast.  Thus, total transmissions are on the order of the square
      of the number of neighboring routers.

   o  Since OSPF uses only provably bidirectional links, unidirectional
      links will be excluded from use.


4.2 Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing

   AODV is an example of a reactive protocol developed in the MANET
   context.  The authors are Charles Perkins (Nokia Research Center),
   Elizabeth Belding-Royer (University of California, Santa Barbara) and
   Samir Das (University of Cincinnati).

   It has, in draft 10, three messages: a Route Request, and Route
   Reply, and a Route Error.  The Route Reply is essentially a route
   announcement or update, in the parlance of more traditional distance
   vector protocols; it says, "You can get to this IP Prefix via me".  A
   Route Request, as its name suggests, searches for a route to an
   address.  When a system needs a route from here to there, it emits a
   local multicast that floods to all systems within some number of hops
   away; those systems also learn from the Route Request a least hop
   count path to the originator of the request.  If a copy of the Route
   Request gets to the target or to any system which has a route to the
   target, that system issues a Route Reply, which is forwarded along
   the best path to the source, and installs a route to the destination.
   This route has a timer on it; it will survive until a movement of one
   of the devices en route changes it, or until the timer expires.

   A route reply is used in another way as well.  It can optionally be
   periodically flooded to all neighbors within a certain distance; the
   specification refers to such behavior as a "hello", and suggests
   limiting the flood to directly accessible routers.  In this way, all

Internet-Draft                  Document                      March 2002


   neighboring systems normally have routes, and need not search among
   immediate neighbors.

   The routers also keep state on any route that is in use; if a packet
   is sent from "here" to "there", each system en route tags the route
   with the fact that the previous hop router to "here" recently used
   the route.  In the event that a route fails (the route is in use and
   times out, the next hop is lost, or the next hop issues a Route Error
   to it), it issues a Route Error to its neighbors that are using the
   route.  This gets back to the source of the traffic.  The source
   recalls how many hops away the destination was and issues a slightly
   wider diameter search, to set up a new route to the destination.

   The protocol was originally specified to support IPv4 in a best
   effort model.  It has been extended, in separate drafts, to carry
   IPv6 information, and to eschew routes that fail specified criteria.
   The latter is referred to as "QoS Routing", on the premise that a
   route which has no more than a certain percentage utilization of the
   link and no more than a specified worst case delay will deliver a
   specified quality of service.

   One issue in robustness has been reported; it is possible to receive
   a Route Reply hello through a link that has a poor signal to noise
   ratio, and be unable to actually use the route for communication.
   Unfortunately, drivers may or may not report the signal to noise
   ratio, the signal to noise ratio does not necessarily translate into
   a statement that a certain percentage of traffic will survive a link,
   and mechanisms in 802.11b that should mitigate this are unimplemented
   and perhaps unimplementable in most drivers.  Experimentation is
   ongoing with filters to detect and deal with this issue.

4.3 Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) Protocol

   OLSR is an example of a proactive protocol using Dijkstra's algorithm
   to calculate routes.  Thomas Clausen, Philippe Jacquet, Anis Laouiti,
   Pascale Minet, Paul Muhlethaler, Amir Qayyum, and Laurent Viennot,
   all of INRIA Rocquencourt in France, originally developed it.
   Comparisons are made to OSPF, of the form "it is a simplified version
   of OSPF".  It is fairer to say that it uses similar fundamental
   algorithms; it distributes connectivity information using a flooding
   algorithm, and maintains a route table calculated using the SPF
   algorithm.  Unlike OSPF, the flooding algorithm is unreliable.

   Fundamentally, the protocol consists of two message exchanges: hello
   messages and link state flooding (which includes both connectivity
   information and withdrawal of the same).  Each system in the network
   emits a periodic hello, which lists the systems whose hellos it is
   hearing.  If those systems can also hear it, the message identifies

Internet-Draft                  Document                      March 2002


   bidirectional channels (channels which carry control traffic in both
   directions).  As they listen to each other, they can determine that
   they may be in possession of information from some of their neighbors
   that other neighbors do not have; they are therefore also able to
   forward these link connectivity messages (or the withdrawal of those
   messages) to their peers.  They can then run an SPF calculation to
   calculate the correct routes.

   This breaks down in two places.  One is that, since every system has
   a slightly different set of neighbors, every system can often justify
   repeating its message to someone.  However, this logic results in far
   more relay transmission of the link state database than is actually
   necessary.  A small subset of those relay systems is capable of
   delivering the same effectiveness in flooding.  The difficult
   question is "what subset should be used?"

   OLSR provides a way of resolving this, by asking each system to
   identify the neighboring system that seems most capable of giving it
   information about the part of the network it is not hearing from
   somewhere else, and designate that system as a MultiPoint Relay
   (MPR).  The systems so designated form a lattice across the larger
   network, relaying routing information and multihop route messages
   among themselves, and relegating the other systems to a status more
   similar to that of hosts in the general Internet.  This provides no
   area hierarchy, in the OSPF sense, but does provide a way to minimize
   the remulticast of routing information, and settles the network on a
   backbone of sorts.  This backbone shifts, as the network itself
   shifts.

   The other problem inherent in OLSR is the same robustness issue found
   in AODV.  It is possible to receive a Hello through a link that has a
   poor signal to noise ratio, and be unable to actually use the route
   for communication.  As with AODV, experimentation is ongoing with
   filters to detect and deal with this issue.

   The robustness issue has another side effect, however, this more
   serious.  Since flooding is unreliable and links are error-prone,
   there is a nontrivial chance that the information fails to be
   delivered everywhere.  In such cases, routing may recover; the best
   route may not be calculated, but the network may succeed in
   calculating one that works.  If routing does not, one can only hope
   that the route is not used until it is corrected.

   Ongoing research is looking at the MPR determination heuristic and
   the use of filters to identify unacceptably lossy links.

4.4 Extensions to OSPF Version 3

   OSPF Version 3 [12]is an extension of OSPF to IPv6, and uses IPv6 to
   accomplish its goals.  It is quite similar to OSPF V2 in most
   respects, but an important consideration is that it uses the IPv6
   link-local address for all inter-router links, and injects prefixes
   into an area in an LSA separate from the LSA used to construct the
   area's routing lattice.  This reduces or eliminates complexities
   related to un-numbered links, choice of prefix, and so on, and adds
   some capabilities in prefix advertisement.  Two properly configured
   routers can neighbor even if they have no prefixes in common, as a
   result.  In a MANET, this is an important result.

   MANET routing should be manageable in OSPF V3 if two extensions are
   adopted: area mobility and a "MANET" interface type with appropriate
   procedure and metric accommodation to the MANET network.  If these
   two modifications are accepted, then the only remaining issue is that
   OSPF only uses bidirectional links, which is not necessarily bad.

4.4.1 Area Mobility

   One issue in MANET routing using OSPF is what happens when a router
   finds itself faced with someone of a different area.  For example, if
   a vehicle associated with one area goes around a hill to a region
   occupied by another, it still needs to communicate with its home
   base, but the only available connectivity may be through the new OSPF
   area.  It is possible to configure the use of every possible area on
   the MANET interface, but this is problematic.  It seems like a better
   approach would be to autodetect the area and join it.  For scaling
   reasons, in some cases, a special "joining area" is also advisable.

   Apart from administrative issues, autodetection is itself
   straightforward: as the device moves into the new area, it will start
   receiving hellos from new neighbors, which carry the configuration of
   the interface that they use.  When configured to do so, and assuming
   that appropriate authentication has taken place, the router auto-
   creates an OSPF interface on the MANET interface that adopts those
   parameters.  The hellos initiated on that OSPF interface will now
   neighbor with the new devices.

   Several problems instantly materialize, however.

   A router which is in two or more areas, in OSPF, is considered to be
   an Area Border Router.  As an ABR, one of the areas it must support
   is area 0.0.0.0, the backbone area, and if there is only an indirect
   connection to other ABRs, a direct connection should be created using
   a virtual link.  For several reasons, this is problematic in a manet.
   Unless the device is configured to be an ABR, it would be better if

   it would advertise all of its prefixes in both areas, and depend on
   the multipath routing characteristics of OSPF to resolve the issue.
   This may be considered similar to running multiple instances of an
   OSPF process, and advertising all local prefixes in both.

   A router which automatically discovers a new area needs an algorithm
   to determine when it should adopt or discard it, and therefore to
   create or collapse the auto-generated area configuration and
   database.  The simplest approach I have come up with involves
   noticing whether a route exists to an ABR.

   The fundamental principle is the principle of least change, coupled
   with the observation that OSPF often summarizes information into the
   backbone, creating a preferred, or "home", area for any given router.
   If a router has the option of communicating in its "home area" or
   another area, it should choose the home area, to maximize the scaling
   utility of summarization.  If this does not result in connectivity to
   an ABR in its home area, however, it will only be able to communicate
   with routers in other areas by joining one or more of them.  If it
   finds an ABR in one of those other areas, it can treat that area as
   its temporary "home" until it finds connectivity in its real "home
   area"; it should join that area and drop other non-home connectivity
   in which an ABR is found.

   One issue with this is that it must join each area long enough to
   determine whether ABR connectivity exists, and stay in the area if
   ABR connectivity is absent.  To minimize the pain of such exchanges,
   I propose an option or attribute on the OSPF Hello that indicates
   whether the device has connectivity to an ABR.  A device trying to
   determine whether it need join an area can determine from this which
   area to join without the full exchange having taken place.

   Another issue arises when several routers meet which have no
   connectivity to any ABR.  In such a case, the algorithm as described
   so far requires them all to join all of their various areas, which at
   best is a great deal of overhead.  A better approach would be to
   specify a special "joining area".  This should be a stub area, to
   limit the advertisement of summaries into it.  Routers issue hellos
   in this area if and only if either

   o  the router has no route to an ABR in any other area

   or

   o  the router has a route to an ABR in another area, and

   o  it is receiving hellos from at least one router in the "joining
      area" which has no ABR connectivity to the backbone.

   In the latter case, the router advertises itself as an ABR into the
   stub "joining area" (but not the other area), as will be discussed.

   Consider the examples in figures 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d.

   Figure 3a: Router changing areas through a non-connectivity zone

   In Figure 3a, we see one fairly common situation: Router A leaves its
   area, has no connectivity, and then finds another area.  It has the
   choice of joining the new area, meeting the devices in the area
   through the "joining area", or having no connectivity.  The downside
   of using the "joining area" in this case is that it requires extra
   overhead.  It should join the new area.  As router A hears router B's
   hello multicasts (which indicate that it has connectivity to an ABR),
   it creates an OSPF interface in that area based on the values
   advertised in B's hello message including the area ID.  In this new
   area, it will download the link state database, calculate its OSPF
   routing, and join the area.  Even though its old area is summarizing
   prefixes into the backbone, and therefore into the new area, its own
   prefix being advertised into the new area will be a longer prefix
   match, and will therefore take precedence, even in the old area.

   Figure 3b: Router changing areas through an overlapping region

   Figure 3b is like 3a, with the exception that the two areas overlap.
   In this case, Router A has a choice as it moves from one area to
   another, as does Router B.  The simplest choice for each to make in
   the region of overlap is to minimize their own level of change - they
   remain solely in their own "home" areas, and communicate via the
   backbone.  However, as Router A moves, it finds that it eventually
   loses connectivity to its ABR, and therefore to the backbone.  To
   communicate globally, it must therefore join the new area, which in
   essence reduces to the case in figure 3a.

   Similarly, if the router is not in its "home" area but has
   connectivity to an ABR in the area it has roamed to, it has no reason
   to change areas other than rejoining its home area.  It should stay
   in the area it has roamed to until that no longer works.

   When the router comes into contact with a device with ABR
   connectivity in its "home" area, the same thing happens but with a
   different bias.  Router A prefers its "home" area over all others due
   to the global optimization that summarization affords.  Therefore,
   when it hears such a hello in its home area, it joins that area even
   if it has ABR connectivity in another area, and then leaves the other
   area.  In such a case, for robustness, it does not actively leave the
   other area until connectivity to an ABR has been established in its
   own area.

   Figure 3c: Routers meeting apart from their "homes" in the "joining
   area"

   In figure 3c, two routers leave their regions of connectivity, as
   Router A did in figure 3a.  However, rather than finding each other's
   areas, they find each other as entities isolated from the backbone.
   As soon as they lose ABR connectivity, they started issuing hello
   messages in the "joining area", and now neighbor there.  This affords
   them local connectivity (with each other).

   Figure 3d: Routers in the "joining area" meet another area

   In figure 3d, a device (Router B) in the "joining area" hears hellos
   from a device in another area which has ABR connectivity.  Its first
   instinct is, of course, to join that area, either because it is its
   home area, or because it is an area with ABR connectivity.  However,
   doing so precipitously leaves the other routers in the "joining area"
   without connectivity.  Therefore, the router does not actively leave
   the "joining area", but participates in a controlled switchover,
   leaving only when its services are no longer needed.

   Once it has synchronized with the other area, it starts issuing
   hellos in the new area that indicate that it is connected to an ABR.
   Other routers in the "joining area" will hear these, and by the same
   logic, synchronize with it in the new area.  In short order, the
   "joining area" will collapse into the new area, lattices, prefixes,
   and all, and the last router out will turn off the lights.

4.4.2 MANET Interface Type

   Section 4.1details the behavior and issues of either the point to
   multipoint interface or a multicast interface.  In context, it seems
   that MANET calls for an interface type which

   o  Is multicast capable, and uses multicast for link state flooding.

   o  Does not elect a designated router.

   o  Enables a router that becomes active with a large number of
      communicating routers simultaneously to synchronize its LSA



Baker                  Expires September 15, 2002              [Page 24]

      database with them serially (or at least one of them first) on a
      unicast basis, on the assumption that they are likely to already
      be synchronized among themselves.

   o  Results in a set of point to point relationships with its
      neighbors being advertised in its router links LSA.

   o  Repeats a new LSA in a multicast on the interface it was received
      on, both to implicitly acknowledge its receipt and to propagate it
      to neighbors who may not have received the initial multicast.

   This is very similar to the point to multipoint interface type, with
   the exception of the final bullet.  The implication is that it need
   not respond to a multicast announcement with a unicast
   acknowledgement; the multicast retransmission implicitly acknowledges
   the update.  However, a unicast retransmission of the update needs to
   result in a unicast acknowledgement.  Thus, an LSA update requires
   each router in the area to make a single multicast transmission (ie,
   there area linear distribution effects), potentially with some level
   of unicast retransmission.  There is one side-effect of this behavior
   that bears investigation: sending a multicast which requires its
   receivers to each potentially send a message has correlated
   transmissions as a necessary result.  In a CSMA environment, the
   implication is that they are likely to collide, resulting in a high
   rate of loss.

   Many of the MANET routing protocols find ways to not have correlated
   reasons to transmit, by not acknowledging, or by including the
   acknowledgements in uncorrelated messages.  On multiplexed
   interfaces, OSPF is often implemented with some form of randomized
   delay or link layer serialization prior to acknowledgement, to limit
   this effect.  There is an issue in randomized delays, however, in a
   radio environment: for the randomization to have the necessary
   effect, the distribution of the messages must be uniform, and the
   interval must be long enough that any two transmitters have a very
   low probability of collision.  As a result, the period over which the
   transmissions occur must be a multiple of the message duration and
   the number of relevant routers, minimally on the order of two to four
   times that product.  This tends to result in an arbitrary extension
   of the network convergence interval.

   One could also imagine solving that using link layer disciplines
   similar to that used in LDDI, wherein each router generates a link
   layer sequence number and transmissions are made in that order.  The
   routing protocol could carry in its "hello" message a "transmission
   sequence number", which is essentially a random number that the
   routers verify is different among neighboring routers.  In LDDI, the
   link protocol assigns each device a time slot by giving it a sequence



Baker                  Expires September 15, 2002              [Page 25]

Internet-Draft                  Document                      March 2002


   number in a range 1..N.  System number 1 gets the first turn; it
   either leaves a minimum-sized message duration idle, or transmits a
   message.  System 2 listens, and when System 1's message duration or
   transmission is done, leaves a minimum-sized interval or transmits a
   message.  The process repeats through system N, who will have waited
   through N-M idle time slots and seen M messages.  System N then sends
   its own message, if it has one, followed by a short message as though
   from system 0, triggering the start of a new round.  Through this
   scheme, they effectively pass a token for access to the otherwise-
   CSMA link, but do so without a "token" message.

   In a radio network, when acknowledging a multicast message, this
   could be emulated if every router organized a sequence number among
   its neighbors.  This would be a random integer not duplicated among
   neighboring routers, an a relatively small range such as 1..twice the
   number of neighboring routers.  It is transmitted in the "hello"
   message, and any router receiving its own number from a neighboring
   system is obligated to change its number.  When a multicast link
   state advertisement is received, or similar message which the router
   realizes that it must acknowledge and is likely to collide with
   others while doing, it schedules the message sequence*interval time
   units in the future, to limit the probability of collision; with CSMA
   techniques, there is an improved chance of collision avoidance.
   "Interval", of course, must be defined; one might expect it to be the
   MANET interface's MTU in bits divided by its link speed, perhaps with
   some randomization.

   A simple way to generate the sequence number would be to sort the
   addresses listed in the combined hellos of a set of neighbors.  If a
   system has N neighbors, and constructs the union of the link
   addresses or router ids that they are advertising, and sorts them
   numerically as unsigned numbers, any given system's sequence number
   may be its own index in that array.  While every system will have a
   slightly different view of the array, the approach at least has the
   possibility of distributing the traffic.

   There are good reasons to put this behavior in the link layer
   protocol, as the designers of LDDI did.  However, if the MANET
   routing protocol is the only protocol that has a message-burst issue,
   one could also argue for making it a configurable feature if the
   routing protocol.

4.4.3 Metric issues: selecting a path with adequate link quality

   OSPF leaves the design of the routing metric to the administration,
   with only the proviso that it will use the route that minimizes the
   sum of the metrics en route, and they must fit in a specified range.

Internet-Draft                  Document                      March 2002


   One example might be a hierarchical function

         metric = f(policy)*2^j + g(quality)*2^k + h(throughput)

   where

   o  The OSPF metric is in 1..2^16-1, and specifies "goodness" of the
      link.  The "best" links have small numbers.

   o  "f(Policy)" is a variable with four to eight values, and indicates
      the device's willingness to act as a router.  A device with a
      stable power source, for example, may be more willing than a
      battery-powered device, and a device with a recently charged
      battery may be more willing than a device whose battery is
      depleted.  Preferred links have small numbers.

   o  "g(Quality)" is a measure of link quality to the neighbor, with a
      small number of values indicating "good" to "poor" quality - on
      the order of two to four numeric values plus "not reachable".
      This might derive from the signal to noise ratio, the correction
      rate of the convolutional decoder, the bit error rate, or similar
      measures.  The measure it is derived from should be filtered using
      a technique such as a median value filter feeding into an
      exponentially weighted moving average, with the result being
      compared to thresholds to determine the value to advertise.  High
      quality relationships have small numbers.

   o  "h(Throughput)" is a measure of the capacity of the link to move
      data, perhaps an 12 bit integer.  Since radios vary in their
      effective transmission rate, both by design and environment, this
      may have to be variable.  If it is, changes should be similarly
      filtered.  The fastest links have small numbers

   The reason for such a complex metric is that mobile ad hoc networks
   have a more complex environment than wired networks.  As mentioned in
   Section 2, signal quality can vary on the same neighbor relationship
   in the absence of motion, and neighbor relationships can be very
   dynamic.  The metric should enable path optimization where it can,
   but focus on measured link quality and communication policy where it
   must.

   The downside of this approach is that the utility of links can change
   rapidly and dramatically, changing the routing.  The changes in
   routing, of course, are to work around problems in the network, and
   without the changes, communication is hindered.  However, oscillation
   is itself problematic (as the BBN SPF experience demonstrated), and
   to be minimized.

   One issue that remains, with this metric as proposed, is that it
   describes what is being received from a neighbor, while OSPF metrics
   typically describe what can be sent to an interface or a neighbor.
   Ideally, this should be advertised at the link layer, so that the
   network layer protocol need not change.  Otherwise, the simplest way
   to describe this will be to have the metric advertised by the routing
   peer be used in the SPF calculation, which at best is a cumbersome
   modification to that algorithm.

   In any event, it seems best if the metric, or at least the "goodness"
   and "speed" components, is considered a vale read from or presented
   through a link layer API.  The ideal API would enable reading the
   value on demand, and either present the new value when significant
   events happen (such as a major change in the metric) or trigger its
   being read.

4.4.4 Scaling Properties

   The scaling properties of a manet routing protocol are a subject of
   frequent concern.  It is to ameliorate these issues that OLSR
   developed the concept of a Multi-Point Relay, or MPR.  In essence, if
   a few devices can stand in routing as interchange points and the rest
   can adopt the role of a host, the scaling properties of a network are
   improved.

   Without further modification, OSPF cannot readily develop that role.
   What it can do, however, is limit the neighbor relationships.  If a
   router discovers that it has more neighbors than some threshold,
   perhaps the number of Router IDs than will fit in a Hello message,
   one option is to send only a subset of those Router IDs.  The router
   might choose, for example, to neighbor only with those routers whose
   metrics are in the lowest third of the range, or only with those most
   "willing" to connect.

4.4.5 IPv4 routing using IPv6

   As discussed in the IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture [5][29],
   there are two ways to carry IPv4 addresses within IPv6 addresses.
   One, written "::a.b.c.d", describes IPv4 addresses whose end system
   supports both IPv4 and IPv6 and need not be translated either way.
   The other, written "::FFFF:a.b.c.d", describes an address used by an
   IPv4-only host.

   If the latter is carried as an IPv6 address in OSPF V3, the end
   system can (at least in theory) be relied on to send it as IPv4
   messages; in the event that a host sends an IPv6 message to it, a
   translating gateway can translate the messages.  However, OSPF V3
   does not natively install IPv4 routes, depending instead on an IPv4

   routing protocol to do this.

   It seems that it would be wise to implement a configuration option
   that would import IPv4 interface prefixes and advertise them in IPv6
   routing, and would generate an IPv4 route table from IPv6 routes in
   these cases.  This would facilitate IPv4 connectivity in an IPv6
   routing infrastructure.

5. Application and Transport Protocols

   A related set of issues has been reviewed by various researchers at
   the transport layer and its counterpart in applications.  Wireless
   networks are notably subject to loss due to issues in physics and
   timing issues among devices that cannot "hear" each other but are
   attempting to communicate with other devices, which can.  The
   temptation is to change TCP (which is widely used in Internet
   communications) or to absorb the transport into the application layer
   in a special manner.  One example of such an application protocol
   runs on UDP and places a sequence number in each message.  The entire
   file is transferred in serial order, with the receiver acknowledging
   received messages.  Transmission of unacknowledged packets is
   repeated at intervals until all packets are acknowledged.  Such
   procedures avoid the vagaries of TCP's congestion avoidance behavior,
   but are obviously ill-suited to a larger internet.

   Section 2.1 stated, however, that interoperation with the larger
   internet is indeed important.  Manets occur as stand-alone networks,
   but they also occur as stubs off larger backbones, and as transit
   systems between small edge networks.  Further, commercially available
   applications are designed to use TCP.  In order to use those
   applications in manet environments, we face a choice: we can convince
   the manufacturer to rehost the application for our amusement, or we
   can adapt the environment to support the application.  Both avenues
   have difficulties.

   One particularly promising development is found in a combination of
   TCP Congestion Control [8] with "New Reno" Fast Recovery [9],
   Selective Acknowledgment [1][13], and Explicit Congestion
   Notification [14].  If congestion is explicitly signaled and managed,
   then lost data may be more aggressively retransmitted, and still
   remain interoperable with more reliable parts of the Internet.

6. Conclusions

   The discussion yields no strong conclusions at this time.  A number
   of protocols have been considered in research, with the result that
   we have learned quite a bit about these networks.  Some of that
   learning has been relearning lessons already learned in the Internet
   itself, with the resultant reinvention of related solutions, or
   remembering the reasons they were invented.

6.1 Selecting a protocol

   It is not obvious that a single protocol is an adequate solution for
   all MANET problems.  As in wired networks, there is room for
   creativity, and for difference of opinion.  To give an idea of the
   classes of applications and aspects of solutions that drive them,
   consider these three cases:

6.1.1 Military Communications

   A SEAL team and a battalion of Army Rangers land in some random
   mountainous country in southern Asia.  Rather than depend on local
   infrastructure, they will use satellites and may install temporary
   fixed infrastructure if the plan of battle warrants it.

   In contexts like this, proactive manet protocols (TBRPF, OLSR, a
   modified OSPF, etc) make the most sense.  The important issue is not
   the high level of dynamism.  It is the fact that there is a
   continuous lower-rate change, the fact that there is no external
   infrastructure to depend on, and the fact that applications in the
   network need the network to be stable and working when they decide
   the time has come to use it.

6.1.2 Automotive Networks

   Consider a service in which automobiles can "talk to the road" to
   obtain maps, weather, congestion-and-accident-ahead updates, and so
   on.  It might also be used to check passing hotel availability, and
   to talk car to car, for example to facilitate navigation in a
   caravan.  In Japan, this is done with wideband CDMA in late-model
   automobiles.

   It does not make a lot of sense to view "every road in the world" as
   a single manet; more likely, sections of road, geographic regions,
   administrations running the roads, or political regions will be
   manets.  It is also not obvious what the "backbones" would be -
   freeways, perhaps, but in much of the world distinguished systems are
   not obvious.  Protocols like AODV have strong appeal in such
   environments.  They would, however, need some provision for crossing

   administrative boundaries in the same fashion, perhaps by having
   nodes that pass an administrative boundary give it some routing
   information as they pass.

   Mobile IP has been proposed as a means of managing administrative
   boundaries.  However, it seems to not make operational sense to this
   author.  The issue is the rate of change.  A vehicle mostly needs to
   "talk" to the next street lamp and the car a half a mile away,
   especially when the car takes an unexpected turn.  The radio in the
   car halfway in between, which I have been traveling with for the past
   ten minutes, is a more stable relay system than the street lamps I'm
   passing or any ISP link.  There is no reason to be constantly
   updating my home ISP every time I pass another street lamp, and no
   reason to form a new IPv6 address, either.

6.1.3 Classic Sensor Network

   There's a brushfire in your favorite place to not have a brushfire,
   and we want to manage it.  So we have a plane drop "golf balls" all
   over it - organic styrofoam-like stuff protecting the level of
   electronics one finds in a wrist watch these days, which has just
   enough smarts and capability to GPS where it is located, to
   periodically say "I'm [here], and I'm still here", and to forward
   similar messages from other devices.  These talk to a central PC,
   which keeps track of which "golf balls" are still up and which have
   failed.  When a device fails, the central system dispatches someone
   to wonder why.

   This seems to be a good application for a source routed protocol like
   DSR.  The only routing any given system needs is its current route to
   the central system.  Exploration surges will be huge at times,
   especially at first, but having once subsided will likely be of
   limited impact.  If the central system needs a route back, it has
   plenty of capacity in which to store it.

6.2 Commercial Considerations

   Commercially, if I had to hang my hat on two solutions, one reactive
   and one proactive, at this time I would go with AODV and some
   extensions to OSPF V3.  The reasons for those choices are:

   o  AODV is well advanced and has good capabilities for its target
      networks.

   o  AODV is publicly documented, as opposed to being partially
      documented in corporate research reports or intellectual property
      declarations.

   o  AODV has preliminary work on QoS Routing and IPv6 routing in
      place; for other protocols, these are futures.

   o  OSPF has significant market traction.

   o  OSPF can be extended to include MANET-type interfaces,
      incorporating lessons from OLSR, TBRPF, and so on.

   o  If this is done, OSPF can span wired and wireless networks.

7. Security Considerations

   In routing, beside the fundamental faults of undebugged code, there
   are three primary threats.

   o  A network may require privacy in order to not give away important
      information.

   o  A network device may be improperly configured, so that the
      information it exchanges is incorrect, or its presence otherwise
      disrupts the network.

   o  A rogue system may mimic, inject, or remove routes in order to
      disrupt traffic flow.

   OSPF performs simple neighboring parameter verification to detect and
   avoid misconfigured neighbors, and several protocols mention IPSEC
   for authentication or privacy.  Besides that, no proposed manet
   routing protocol explicitly addresses any of these issues.

   In MANET networks where link privacy is a significant consideration,
   it is logical to presume physical or link layer encryption.  IPSEC
   encryption could be used, but a radio listener who read the IP
   headers could deduce much of the routing information.  This could be
   of military value, for example; if I know that a large number of
   communicating systems are reached via one system and a small number
   by another, and can determine which is which via radio direction
   finding, I may be able to locate a force concentration or detect the
   splitting off of a sortie.  I may also be able to locate a single
   point of failure, a system that is temporarily critical to
   battlefield communications, and know to target it.

   The deployment of any form of link or IPSEC encryption, however,
   requires some form of key distribution.  This is a problem which has
   not been solved at this writing.

   Neighbor authentication and privacy techniques do not, however, place
   a signature on an LSA, such as is suggested in OSPF with Digital
   Signatures [3], or otherwise address the issues raised in Routing
   Policy System Security [11].  Thus, these protocols do not secure the
   network against a rogue system once its neighbors decide to trust it.
