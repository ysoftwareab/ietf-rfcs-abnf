Abstract 
    
   Record Route is a useful administrative tool that has been used 
   extensively by the service providers. When TE links are bundled, 
   identification of label resource in RRO is not enough for the 
   administrative purpose. Network service providers would like to know 
   the component link within a TE link that is being used by a given 
   LSP. In other words, when link bundling is used, resource recording

   requires mechanisms to specify the component link identifier, along 
   with the TE link identifier and Label. However, it is not possible to 
   record component link in the RRO. This draft defines the extensions 
   to RSVP-TE [RFC3209] to specify component link identifiers for 
   resource recording purposes.  
    
   In this draft, we also define ERO counterpart of the RRO extension. 
   The ERO extensions are needed to perform explicit label/ resource 
   control over bundled TE link. 
    
   In summary, this draft defines the extensions to RSVP-TE [RFC3209] to 
   specify component link identifiers for explicit resource control and 
   recording over GMPLS link bundles.

1.   Terminology 
                   
   TE Link - Unless specified otherwise, it refers to a bundled Traffic 
   Engineering link as defined in [BUNDLE]. Furthermore, the terms TE 
   Link and bundled TE Link are used interchangeably in this draft.  
    
   Component Interface - Refers to a component link in a bundled TE 
   link.  
    
   Component Interface Identifier - Refers to an ID used to uniquely 
   identify a Component Interface. 
     
2.   Introduction 
 
      In classical MPLS that deals with unbundled packet switch capable 
   Traffic Engineering (TE) Links, one of the types of resources that an 
   LSP originator can control and would like to record are the TE Link 
   interfaces used by the LSP. The resource control and recording is 
   done by the use of an explicit route, i.e., EXPLICIT_ROUTE Object 
   (ERO) and RECORD_ROUTE Object (RRO), respectively. 
    
      Link Bundling introduced by [BUNDLE], is used to improve routing 
   scalability by reducing the amount of TE related information that 
   needs to be flooded and handled by IGP in a TE network. This is 
   accomplished by aggregating and abstracting the TE Link resource.  
    
      In most scenarios the complete resource identification is left as 
   a local decision. However, as detailed in Section 3, there are cases 
   when it is desirable for a non-local (e.g., LSP Head-end) node to 
   identify completely or partially the LSP resources. Consequently, 
   Label ERO (Explicit Route Object) and RRO (Record Route Object) 
   subobjects are defined in [RFC3473] to support Explicit Label Control 
   and recording.   
       
      When link bundling is used to aggregate multiple component links 
   into a TE link, label is not the only resource that needs to be 
 
 
Zamfir, A., Ali, Z., Papadimitroiu, D.                        [Page 3]

   identified and recorded. In other words, the TE Link and the Label 
   specified in the ERO/ RRO objects are not enough to completely 
   identify the resource. For the bundled TE link case, in order to 
   fully specify the resources on a link for a given LSP, the component 
   link needs to be specified along with the label. In the case of bi-
   directional LSPs both upstream and downstream information may be 
   specified. Therefore, explicit resource control and recording over a 
   bundled TE link also requires ability to specify a component link 
   within the TE link. 
     
      This draft defines extensions to and describes the use of RSVP-TE 
   [RFC3209], [RFC3471], [RFC3473], and [RFC3477] to specify the 
   component link identifier for resource recording and explicit 
   resource control over GMPLS link bundles. Specifically, in this 
   draft, component interface identifier RRO and ERO subobjects are 
   defined to complement their Label RRO and ERO counterparts. 
   Furthermore, procedures for processing component interface identifier 
   RRO and ERO subobjects and how they can co-exist with the Label RRO 
   and ERO subobjects are specified.  
 
3.   Requirement 
    
      Component link recording and resource control for GMPLS Link 
   Bundles inherits requirements from its Label control and recording 
   counterpart, which is defined in [RFC3473]. However, there are some 
   requirements that makes component link recording more useful. In this 
   section we mainly outline the requirements of component link 
   recording and control beyond the applications that are motivating 
   point behind Label control and recording procedure in [RFC3473].  
    
      One of the main requirements for component link recording is 
   diagnostics. Specifically, for administrative reasons, it is required 
   to know which component link within a bundled TE link has been used 
   for a given LSP. 
    
      In a GMPLS networks it∆s often required to explicitly control LSP 
   resources over a given path. Furthermore, in component links are 
   multiplexing capable, component link information is required to pin 
   the path to the (component link, label) resource pair. Here component 
   link information, just like its label counterpart, is assumed to be 
   known to operator via means other than IGP.   
    
      Another requirement is induced by SRLG diverse working/protecting 
   LSP pair computation in applications such as the shared mesh 
   recovery. This requirement comes from the fact that SRLG of a GMPLS 
   bundled link is the union of the SRLGs of all the component links 
   ([GMPLS-ROUTING] and [BUNDLE]). This abstraction introduces 
   additional blocking in establishing SRLG diverse LSPs. Specifically, 
   the component link recording enables the remote (Head) node to 
 
 
Zamfir, A., Ali, Z., Papadimitroiu, D.                        [Page 4] 
      draft-zamfir-explicit-resource-control-bundle-03.txt February 2004 
 
 
   retrieve (if this information is locally known) the SRLG assigned to 
   the component link(s), instead of the union of SRLG associated with 
   the bundled TE link. This allows easier usage of the SRLG XRO 
   subobject defined in [XRO]. 
    
      In the same context, the component link control can also be used 
   to select specific component links with desired SRLG (by the Head/ 
   node performing ERO expansion).  
    
      One of the applications of component link recording is to request 
   component link diversed paths. Specifically, once RRO with component 
   link recording is received at the ingress node, the node can make use 
   of the component link information to request diverse path with 
   respect to component links using the corresponding XRO subobject (see 
   [XRO])." 
    
      Another application of communicating component link level 
   information is in fault notification. Specifically, a new error code 
   indicating 'component link failure' in Path Error or Notify message 
   is defined in [CRANKBACK]. This is to allow an ingress node to NOT 
   exclude the bundled link with the failed component link.  
    
4.   LSP Resource Recording  
 
      This refers to the ability to record the resources used by an LSP. 
   The procedure for unbundled numbered TE links is described in 
   [RFC3209] and for unbundled unnumbered TE links in [RFC 3477]. For 
   the purpose of recording LSP resources used over bundled TE Links, 
   the Component Interface Identifier RRO sub-object is introduced.  
   
4.1 Component Interface Identifier RRO subobject 
     
      A new subobject of the Record Route Object (RRO) is used to record 
   component interface identifier of a (bundled) TE Link. This subobject 
   has the following format:  
      Figure 2: Component Interface Identifier RRO subobject 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      |                Component Interface Identifier               |

            This bit must be set to 0. 
    
    
         Type 
    
            10 (TBD) Component Interface identifier IPv4  
            11 (TBD) Component Interface identifier IPv6 
            12 (TBD) Component Interface identifier Unnumbered 
    
    
         Length 
    
            The Length contains the total length of the subobject in 
            bytes, including the Type and Length fields. The Length is 
            8 bytes for the Component Interface identifier IPv4 and 
            Component Interface identifier Unnumbered types. For 
            Component Interface identifier IPv6 type of sub-object, the 
            length field is 20 bytes. 
             
         U: 1 bit 
    
            This bit indicates the direction of the component 
            interface.  It is 0 for the downstream interface.  It is 
            set to 1 for the upstream interface and is only used for 
            bi-directional LSPs.        
                
4.2 Processing of Component Interface identifier RRO Subobject  
     
      If a node desires component link recording, the "Component Link 
   Recording desired" flag (value TBD) should be set in the 
   LSP_ATTRIBUTES object, object that is defined in [RSVP-TE-ATTRIBUTE]. 
   Another alternate is to use an available flag in the 
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object [RFC3209]. The later makes the component 
   link recording request similar to the label recording request. These 
   alternatives need to be discussed with the CCAMP working group and 
   close accordingly.   
    
   Setting of "Component Link Recording desired" flag is independent of 
   the Label Recording flag in SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object as specified in 
   [RFC3209]. Nevertheless, the following combinations are valid: 
      1) If both Label and Component Link flags are clear, then neither 
   Labels nor Component Links are recorded. 
      2) If Label Recording flag is set and Component Link flag is 
   clear, then only Label Recording is performed as defined in 
   [RFC3209]. 
      3) If Label Recording flag is clear and Component Link flag is 
   set, then Component Link Recording is performed as defined in this 
   proposal. 
 
 
Zamfir, A., Ali, Z., Papadimitroiu, D.                        [Page 6] 
      draft-zamfir-explicit-resource-control-bundle-03.txt February 2004 
 
 
      4) If both Label Recording and Component Link flags are set, then 
   Label Recording is performed as defined in [RFC3209] and also 
   Component Link recording is performed as defined in this proposal. 
    
      In most cases a node initiates recording for a given LSP by adding 
   the RRO to the Path message. If the node desires Component Link 
   recording and if the outgoing TE link is bundled, then the initial 
   RRO contains the Component Link identifier (numbered or unnumbered) 
   as selected by the sender. As well, the Component Link Recording 
   desired flag is set in the LSP_ATTRIBUTE object. If the node also 
   desires label recording, it sets the Label_Recording flag in the 
   SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object. 
    
      When a Path message with the "Component Link Recording desired" 
   flag set is received by an intermediate node, if a new Path message 
   is to be sent for a downstream bundled TE link, the node adds a new 
   Component Link subobject to the RRO and appends the resulting RRO to 
   the Path message before transmission. 
    
      Note that, unlike Labels, Component Link identifiers are always 
   known on receipt of the Path message. 
    
      When the destination node of an RSVP session receives a Path 
   message with an RRO and the "Component Link Recording desired" flag 
   set, this indicates that the sender node needs TE route as well as 
   component link recording.  The destination node initiates the RRO 
   process by adding an RRO to Resv messages. The processing mirrors 
   that of the Path messages 
    
      The Component Interface Record subobject is pushed onto the 
   RECORD_ROUTE object prior to pushing on the node's IP address. A node 
   MUST NOT push on a Component Interface Record subobject without also 
   pushing on the IP address or unnumbered Interface Id subobject that 
   identifies the TE Link. 
    
      When component interfaces are recorded for bi-directional LSPs, 
   component interface RRO subobjects for both downstream and upstream 
   interfaces MUST be included. 
    
5.   Signaling Component Interface Identifier in ERO 
    
      A new OPTIONAL subobject of the EXPLICIT_ROUTE Object (ERO) is 
   used to specify component interface identifier of a bundled TE Link. 
   This subobject has the following format:  
    
      Figure 1: Component Interface Identifier ERO subobject 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3

            12 (TBD) Component Interface identifier Unnumbered 
    
    
         Length 
    
             The Length contains the total length of the subobject in 
             bytes, including the Type and Length fields. The Length is 
             8 bytes for the Component Interface identifier types: IPv4 
             and Component Interface identifier Unnumbered. For 
             Component Interface identifier IPv6 type of sub-object, 
             the length field is 20 bytes.  
    
    
         U: 1 bit 
             This bit indicates the direction of the component 
             interface.  It is 0 for the downstream interface.  It is 
             set to 1 for the upstream interface and is only used for  
             bi-directional LSPs.  
              
    
5.1 Processing of Component Interface Identifier ERO Subobject 
       
    The Component Interface Identifier ERO subobject follows a subobject 
   containing the IP address, or the link identifier [RFC3477], 
   associated with the TE link on which it is to be used. It is used to 
   identify the component of a bundled TE Link. 
    
      The following SHOULD result in "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" error 
   being sent upstream by a node processing an ERO that contains the 
   Component Interface ID sub-object: 
    
      o The first component interface identifier subobject is not 
      preceded by a sub-object containing an IPv4 or IPv6 address, or 
      an interface identifier [RFC3477], associated with a TE link. 
 
 
Zamfir, A., Ali, Z., Papadimitroiu, D.                        [Page 8] 
      draft-zamfir-explicit-resource-control-bundle-03.txt February 2004 
 
 
      o The Component Interface Identifier ERO subobject follows a 
      subobject that has the L-bit set. 
      o On unidirectional LSP setup, there is a Component Interface 
      Identifier ERO subobject with the U-bit set. 
      o Two Component Interface Identifier ERO subobjects with the same 
      U-bit values exist. 
       
      If a node implements the component interface identifier subobject, 
   it must check if it represents a component interface in the bundled 
   TE Link specified in the preceding subobject that contains the IP 
   address or interface identifier of the TE Link. If the content of the 
   component interface identifier subobject does not match a component 
   interface in the TE link, a "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" error SHOULD 
   be reported as "Routing Problem" (error code 24).  
      If U-bit of the subobject being examined is cleared (0) and the 
   upstream interface specified in this subobject is acceptable, then 
   the value of the upstream component interface is copied in the TLV of 
   the IF_ID HOP object [RFC 3471] and the local decision normally used 
   to select the upstream component link is bypassed. If this interface 
   is not acceptable, a "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" error SHOULD be 
   reported as "Routing Problem" (error code 24).   
       
      If the U-bit of the subobject being examined is set (1), then the 
   value represents the component interface to be used for upstream 
   traffic associated with the bidirectional LSP.  Again, if this 
   interface is not acceptable or if the request is not one for a 
   bidirectional LSP, then a "Bad EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" error SHOULD be 
   reported as "Routing Problem" (error code 24).  Otherwise, the 
   component interface IP address/ identifier is copied into a TLV sub-
   object as part of the IF_ID RSVP_HOP object. 
    
      The IF_ID RSVP_HOP object constructed as above MUST be included in 
   the corresponding outgoing Path message.  
    
      Note that, associated with a TE Link sub-object in the ERO, either 
   the upstream component interface or the downstream component 
   interface or both may be specified. As specified in [BUNDLE] there is 
   no relationship between the TE Link type (numbered or unnumbered) and 
   the Link type of any one of its components.  
    
      The component interface identifier ERO subobject is optional. 
   Similarly, presence of the Label ERO sub-objects is not mandatory 
   [RFC 3471], [RFC 3473]. Furthermore, component interface identifier 
   ERO subobject and Label ERO subobject may be included in the ERO 
   independently of each other. One of the following alternatives 
   applies: 
   o When both sub-objects are absent, a node may select any appropriate 
   component link within the TE link and any label on the selected 
   component link.  
 
 
Zamfir, A., Ali, Z., Papadimitroiu, D.                        [Page 9] 
      draft-zamfir-explicit-resource-control-bundle-03.txt February 2004 
 
 
   o When the Label subobject is only present for a bundled link, then 
   the selection of the component link within the bundle is a local 
   decision and the node may select any appropriate component link, 
   which can assume the label specified in the Label ERO.  
   o  When only the component interface identifier ERO subobject is 
   present, a node MUST select the component interface specified in the 
   ERO and may select any appropriate label value at the specified 
   component link.   
   o When both component interface identifier ERO subobject and Label 
   ERO subobject are present, the node MUST select the specified 
   component link and the specified label value on that component link. 
   When present, both subobjects may appear in any relative order to 
   each other but they MUST appear after the TE Link sub-object that 
   they refer to. 
    
      After processing, the component interface identifier subobjects 
   are removed from the ERO. 
    
      Inferred from above, the interface subobject should never be the 
   first subobject in a newly received message.  If the component 
   interface subobject is the first subobject in a received ERO, then it 
   SHOULD be treated as a "Bad strict node" error. 
    
   Note: Information to construct the Component Interface ERO subobject 
   may come from the same mean used to populate the label ERO subobject.  
   Procedures by which an LSR at the head-end of an LSP obtains the 
   information needed to construct the Component Interface subobject are 
   outside the scope of this document.  
    
6.   Forward Compatibility Note 
 
      The extensions specified in this draft do not affect the 
   processing of the RRO, ERO at nodes that do not support them. A node 
   that does not support the Component Interface RRO subobject but that 
   does support Label subobject SHOULD only insert the Label subobject 
   in the RRO as per [RFC3471] and [RFC3473]. A node that receives an 
   ERO that contains a Component Link ID subobject SHOULD send "Bad 
   EXPLICIT_ROUTE object" if it does not implement this subobject. 
   As per [RFC3209], Section 4.4.5, a non-compliant node that receives 
   an RRO that contains Component Interface Identifier sub-objects 
   should ignore and pass them on. 
    
7.   Security Considerations 
    
     This document does not introduce new security issues. The security 
   considerations pertaining to the original RSVP protocol [RFC2205] 
   remain relevant.
