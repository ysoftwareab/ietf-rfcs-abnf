1.  Introduction

   This experimental extension addresses the use cases described by
   "draft-ietf-ccamp-dwdm-if-mng-ctrl-fwk" to the Spectrum Switched
   Optical Network applications.  LMP [RFC4902] provides link property
   correlation capabilities that can be used between a transceiver
   device and an Optical Line System (OLS) device.  Link property
   correlation is a procedure by which, intrinsic parameters and
   capabilities are exchanged between two ends of a link.  Link property
   correlation as defined in RFC3591 allows either end of the link to
   supervise the received signal and operate within a commonly
   understood parameter window.  Here the term 'link' refers in
   particular to the attachment link between OXC and OLS (see Figure 1).
   The relevant novelty is the interface configuration having a multiple
   carrier where the client signal is spread on.  The parameters are not
   yet fully defined by ITU-T so this document can jast be seen as an
   experimental proposal not binding operators and vendors to comply and
   implement them

2.  DWDM line system

   Figure 1 shows a set of reference points (Rs and Ss), for a single-
   channel connection between transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx)
   devices.  Here the DWDM network elements in between those devices
   include an Optical Multiplexer (OM) and an Optical Demultiplexer
   (OD).  In addition it may include one or more Optical Amplifiers (OA)
   and one or more Optical Add-Drop Multiplexers (OADM).

        carrying the same client payload.
   Rs = Receiver reference point at the DWDM network element
        tributary input this can be a set of multiple transceivers
        carrying the same client payload.

3.  Use Cases

   The set of paramentes exchanged between is to support the Spectrum
   Switched Optical Network in therms of Number of Sub-carriers
   available at the transceiver and their characteristics to provide the
   SSON control plane all the information suitable to calculate the path
   and the optical feasibility

4.  Extensions to LMP-WDM Protocol

   This document defines extensions to [RFC4209] to allow a set of
   characteristic parameters, to be exchanged between a router or
   optical switch and the optical line system to which it is attached.
   In particular, this document defines additional Data Link sub-objects
   to be carried in the LinkSummary message defined in [RFC4204] and
   [RFC6205].  The OXC and OLS systems may be managed by different
   Network management systems and hence may not know the capability and
   status of their peer.  These messages and their usage are defined in
   subsequent sections of this document.

     The following new messages are defined for the SSON extension
       - Multi carrier Transceiver   (sub-object Type = TBA)

5.  Multi carrier Transceiver

   These are a set of general parameters extending the description in
   [G698.2] and [G.694.1].  ITU-T working groups are working to detail
   most of parameters and an update of the TLV may be required.

   The general parameters are
    1. Modulation identifier: indicates the Transceiver capabilities
       to support a single or multiple modulation format like:
       BPSK (1), DC-DP-BSPSK, QPSK, DP-QPSK, QAM16, DP-QAM16,
       DC-DP-QAM16, 64QAM.
    2. FEC: indicates the FEC types the transceiver can support
    3. baud rate: number of symbols rate, besically this identify the
       channel frequency
    4. Num Carriers: number of subcarriers the trasceiver can support
       and can be "mapped" in a Mediachannel
    5. Bits/symbol: number of bit per simbol (aka spectral efficiency)
    6. Subcarrier band (minimum distance between subcarriers) in GHz
    7. Guard band (required guard band at the side of media channel)
    8. Sub-carrier TX Power: output optical power the transceiver can
       provide
    9. Sub-carrier RX Power: Input optical power Range the transceiver
       can support, this is known also as Sensitivity
   10. Sub-carrier OSNR robustness

   TBA) is as follows:

6.  Security Considerations

   LMP message security uses IPsec, as described in [RFC4204].  This
   document only defines new LMP objects that are carried in existing
   LMP messages, similar to the LMP objects in [RFC:4209].  This
   document does not introduce new security considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations
