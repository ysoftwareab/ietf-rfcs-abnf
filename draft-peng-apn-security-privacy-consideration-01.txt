                APN Security and Privacy Considerations
            draft-peng-apn-security-privacy-consideration-01

Abstract

   Application-aware Networking (APN) aims to convey Application-aware
   Information (APN attribute) including APN ID and APN parameters
   indicating application group-level and user group-level requirements
   along with the data packets into the network and enable the network
   to provide corresponding fine-granular network services.

   There have been challenges of the privacy and security issues that
   could potentially be introduced by conveying the APN attribute into
   the network.  This document describes the security and privacy
   considerations of APN in various possible scenarios wherein APN will
   be deployed.

1.  Introduction

   Application-aware Networking (APN) is introduced in
   [I-D.li-apn-framework] and [I-D.li-apn-problem-statement-usecases].
   APN conveys Application-aware Information (APN attribute) along with
   data packets into network and make the network aware of applications'
   requirements in order to provide corresponding network services.  The
   ever-emerging network services such as network slicing and iOAM can
   be further enhanced with the application awareness in the network
   enabled by APN.

   Since APN conveys an APN attribute along with the data packets into
   network, APN has been challenged that it may potentially impose
   privacy and security issues.

                        Figure 1. APN6 Framework

   With APN, the APN attribute is acquired based on the existing
   information in the packet header such as 5-tuple and/or QinQ (S-VLAN
   and C-VLAN) at the edge devices of the APN domain (i.e.  APN-Edge in
   the Figure 1), added to the data packets in the tunnel encapsulation,
   and delivered to the network, wherein, according to the carried APN
   attribute, the fine-granular network services are provisioned.

   The APN attribute is added by the edge device of an APN domain
   according to the local policy at the network edge device (i.e.  APN-
   Edge), which is under the control of the network operator.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   The APN attribute is only used within the network operator's
   controlled limited domain.  A limited domain is intended as a portion
   of the operator infrastructure where APN is deployed.  When a packet
   reaches the boundary of the limited domain, an APN attribute is added
   to the packet, used in order to steer the packet within the limited
   domain and then removed when the packet leaves the limited domain.

   Within the APN network domain, the APN attribute is added at the
   ingress node and removed from the egress node.  In the APN network
   domain, the APN attribute only serves for the fine-granular network
   service provisioning, and there is no harm for the outside of the APN
   network domain.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are two typical scenarios besides the SD-WAN scenario described
   in the draft [I-D.yang-apn-sd-wan-usecase]: the home broadband
   scenario and the mobile broadband scenario.

   In the home broadband scenario, generally a home broadband user is
   authorized by the BNG.  If the validation is passed and the access
   control is released, so the user group can start enjoying the value-
   added service.  With APN, when the traffic traverses the metro
   network, the traffic flow can be indicated by the APN attribute that
   is added/removed at the edge devices of the Metro Network (APN
   domain) based on the mapping from the existing information (e.g. the
   QinQ which is composed of C-VLAN and S-VLAN) in the packet header and
   then carried in the tunnel encapsulation header.  The APN attribute
   will facilitate the fine-granular service in the APN domain.  Once
   the packets leave the APN domain, the APN attribute will be removed
   together with the tunnel encapsulation header.

                    Figure 2.  Home Broadband Scenario

   In the mobile broadband scenario, a UE is authorized by the 5GC
   function, and the traffic steering and QoS policy are enforced by the
   UPF (User Plane Function) node.  If the validation is passed and the
   access control is released, so the user can start enjoying the value-
   added service.  With APN, when the traffic traverses the mobile
   transport network, the traffic flow can be indicated by the APN
   attribute that is added at the edge devices of the mobile transport
   network (APN domain) based on mapping from the existing information
   (e.g.  GTP-u tunnel encapsulation information) in the packet header
   and then carried in the tunnel encapsulation header.  The APN
   attribute will facilitate the fine-granular service in the APN
   domain.  Once the packets leave the APN domain, the APN attribute
   will be removed together with the tunnel encapsulation header.  In
   fact, the APN attribute can also be acquired at the gNB based on the
   mapping of the existing information of the packet header (e.g.
   5-tuple information) and carried along with the GTP-u tunnel
   encapsulation.  The mobile transport network can provide the
   corresponding service according to the APN attribute.  When the
   packet leaves the UPF, the APN attribute can be removed together with
   the GTP-u tunnel encapsulation.

                   Figure 3.  Mobile Broadband Scenario

   In the typical APN scenarios like the home broadband scenario and the
   mobile broadband scenario, before the traffic is delivered to the
   network domain, the end user must be authenticated and authorized
   firstly to guarantee the security of the network domain.  When the
   traffic traverses the APN domain, the APN attribute is added and
   removed at the edge of the APN domain along with the tunnel
   encapsulation.  That is, the APN attribute is only used locally in
   the APN domain and will not introduce the extra security issues.
