          Network Time Protocol Suggest REFID Extension Field
                    draft-stenn-ntp-suggest-refid-03

Abstract

   NTP has been widely used through several revisions, with the latest
   being RFC 5905 [RFC5905].  A core component of the protocol and the
   algorithms is the Reference ID, or REFID, which is used to identify
   the source of time used for synchronization.  Traditionally, when the
   source of time was another system the REFID was the IPv4 address of
   that other system.  The core purpose of the REFID is to prevent a
   one-degree timing loop, where if A has several timing sources that
   include B, if B decides to get its time from A we don't want A then
   deciding to get its time from B.  The REFID is considered to be
   "public data" and is a vital core-component of the base NTP packet.
   If a system's REFID is the IPv4 address of its system peer, an
   attacker can try to use that information to send spoofed time packets
   to either or both the target or the target's server, attempting to
   cause a disruption in time service.  This proposal is a backward-
   compatible way for a time source to tell its peers or clients "If you
   use me as your system peer, use this nonce as your REFID."  This
   nonce SHOULD be untraceable to the original system, and if it is used
   as the REFID this type of attack is prevented.

1.  Introduction

   NTP has been widely used through several revisions, with the latest
   being RFC 5905 [RFC5905].  A core component of the protocol and the
   algorithms is the Reference ID, or REFID, which is used to identify
   the source of time used for synchronization.  Traditionally, when the
   source of time was another system, the REFID was the IPv4 address of
   that other system.  If the remote system was using IPv6 for its
   connection, a 4 octet digest value of the IPv6 address was used.  The
   core purpose of the REFID is to prevent a one-degree timing loop,
   where if A has several timing sources that include B, if B decides to
   get its time from A we don't want A then deciding to get its time
   from B.  The REFID is considered to be "public data" and is a vital
   core-component of the base NTP packet.  If a system's REFID is the
   IPv4 address of its system peer, an attacker can try to use that
   information to send spoofed time packets to either or both the target
   or the target's server, attempting to cause a disruption in time
   service.  This proposal is a backward-compatible way for a time
   source to tell its peers or clients "If you use me as your system

   peer, use this nonce as your REFID."  This nonce, a Suggested REFID,
   SHOULD be untraceable to the sending system.  If the receiving system
   uses this Suggested REFID nonce instead of the IPv4 address as its
   REFID, this type of attack and information disclosure is prevented.

   The NTP protocol was designed with a mechanism that allowed for a
   depth-1 loop detection to avoid a simple "time loop".  Recently, this
   mechanism was discovered to be a potential vulnerability exploit.
   The best way to mitigate this vulnerability is to decouple the IPv4
   address of the server from its REFID.  But there is no current way
   for a potential time source to tell the other party any other
   alternative to use as the REFID.  This proposal creates an extension
   field to accomplish this.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The REFID

   The core reason for the REFID in the NTP Protocol is to prevent a
   timing loop of degree 1.  Put another way, if servers A and B are
   exchanging time with each other and server B decides to follow A as
   its system peer, the REFID that B will use must be able to identify
   server A.  The interpretation of a REFID is based on the stratum, as
   documented in RFC 5905 [RFC5905], section 7.3, "Packet Header
   Variables".  At Stratum 2+, which will be the case if servers A and B
   are exchanging packets over IPv4, if server B follows A, then B will
   have A's IPv4 address as its REFID.  When A asks B for its time, A
   will see that B is synchronized to A because B will tell A that its
   REFID is A's IPv4 address, so when A sees its IP address as B's
   REFID, A knows that if it were to follow B for its time then there
   would be a timing loop.  In this case, A will not select B as a
   potential source of time.

3.  The Suggested REFID Extension Field

   Since there is no way in the base NTP packet for "this" instance of
   an NTP server to tell the "other" instance what REFID it should use
   if the "other" instance decides to use "this" instance as its system
   peer, the best available way to convey this information is via an
   extension field.

                   NTP Extension Field: REFID Suggestion

   Field Type: TBD (Recommendation for IANA: 0x0006 (Suggested REFID))

   Field Length: 0x0008

   Suggested REFID: The 4 octets of the suggested REFID.  This value
   SHOULD be 0xFDxxxxxx, where the bottom 3 octets SHOULD be random
   values.

   Examples: When decoded as an IPv4 address, suggested REFIDs would
   decode as 253.0.0.0 thru 253.255.255.255.

4.  Generating and Sending the Suggested REFID Extension Field

   A system that decides to send a Suggested REFID extension field
   SHOULD generate a new Suggested REFID for each new association.  It
   MAY generate a new Suggested REFID for any association in any
   response.  In addition to remembering the IP-based REFID, the sender
   MUST also remember its most-recent Suggested REFID.

   Since the core NTPv4 and earlier protocols do not contain any way to
   tell the recipient what to use as a REFID and RFC 5905 [RFC5905] uses
   the IPv4 address of the sender as the REFID if the association is
   effected over an IPv4 connection, this means that an attacker can
   simply send an NTP client request to a server knowing that server's
   system peer will be returned as the REFID in the response packet.  At
   this point, an attacker can, if that REFID is an IPv4 address, begin
   to launch attacks at the target forging the putative IP of the
   target's time source, or the attacker can start forging packets to
   the putative time server claiming to be from the target, in an
   attempt to cause the time server to limit or deny time service to the
   target.

   Using a nonce for the REFID that is only recognized by the sending
   machine effectively prevents this type of attack.

   If servers S1, S2, and S3 are all exchanging time with each other and
   are all using the Suggested REFID mechanism, there is a 3 in
   16,777,216 (2^24) chance that two different servers in the same group

   will happen to choose the same nonce, and that would produce a false-
   positive timing loop detection.  If the Suggested REFID is never
   changed, this false-positive condition will occur for potentially a
   long time.  This small risk can be reduced by periodically generating
   a new Suggested REFID.

5.  Receiving a Suggested REFID Extension Field

   An NTP server keeps track of the IP address it uses to talk to a
   client.  If an NTP server chooses to send a Suggested REFID to an
   association, it MUST remember this value.  When checking for a timing
   loop, the Suggested REFID must also be included in the list of tested
   values.
