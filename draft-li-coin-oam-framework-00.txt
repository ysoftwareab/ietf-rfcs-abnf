1.  Introduction

   This document aims to provide a reference framework for Operations,
   Administration and Maintenance (OAM) for Computing in the Network
   (COIN).  The framework describes a tripartite consultation mechanism
   which includes consumers/providers registration, resource discovery/
   allocation, resource occupation, and resource release/refund.

2.  Aspects Monitored by COIN OAM?

   In this framework, the device and platform will be regarded as a
   consumer or a provider of a computing power.  One and the only
   manager will be responsible for the management of computing power and
   the contracts between consumers and providers.

2.1.  Computing Power Consumer

   Computing Power Consumer (or CPC, for short) is an application that
   needs computing power from the network.  As a consumer, the
   application instance must register to CCM and be assigned a node id,
   which is a unique identifier in a COIN system.

2.2.  Computing Contract Management

   Computing Contract Manager (or CCM, for short) is an application that
   is responsible for register administration of all the CPCs, CPPs and
   the Algorithm Repository.  It can connect the consumers of computing
   power and the providers of computing power.  It also signs the
   contracts for both sides.

2.3.  Computing Power Provider

   Computing Power Provider (or CPP, for short) is an application that
   verifies the system having sufficient computing power available for
   external applications.  As a provider, the application instance must
   register to CCM and be assigned a node id, which is a unique
   identifier in a COIN system.

3.  Consultation Mechanism of COIN

3.1.  Register

   CPC and CPP must register to CCM to confirm its role in the COIN
   system.  An application instance can be a CPC and a CPP concurrently.
   In REGISTER Request message, the role field is a mandatory field.
   The CCM must assign a unique node id for the application instance and
   put it in the REGISTER Response message.  The CCM has all the records
   of the CPC and CPP.

   (1)REGISTER Request message includes:

   *Role type, identifying the role of the computing power contract.  It
   may be consumer or provider

   (2)REGISTER Response message includes:

   *Role type, identifying the role of the computing power contract.  It
   may be consumer or provider

   *computing node id, unique node id assigned by CCM.

3.2.  Discover/Allocate

   When a CPC meets distributed computing task,it seeks for computing
   power from CCM by DISCOVER Request message,along with the computing
   power requirements and corresponding algorithm requirements.  Now
   that CCM has all the records of CPPs,it can choose one or more
   appropriate CPPs and send ALLOCATE Request message to them.  The
   message at the same time contains the computing power requirements
   and corresponding algorithm requirements.

   After the CPP has prepared for the necessary computing power and
   algorithm function, it sends ALLOCATE Response message to CCM with
   its provider node id and a serial number.After the CCM send DISCOVER
   Response message to CPC, the contract between a CPC and a CPP has
   been signed through CCM.
