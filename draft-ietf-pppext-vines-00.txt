Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP
   defines an extensible Link Control Protocol, and proposes a family of
   Network Control Protocols for establishing and configuring different
   network-layer protocols.

   This document defines the Network Control Protocol for establishing
   and configuring the Banyan VINES Routing protocol over PPP.

1.  Introduction

   PPP has three main components:

      1. A method for encapsulating multi-protocol datagrams.

      2. A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing, configuring,
         and testing the data-link connection.

      3. A family of Network Control Protocols for establishing and
         configuring different network-layer protocols.

   In order to establish communications over a point-to-point link, each
   end of the PPP link must first send LCP packets to configure and test
   the data link.  After the link has been established and optional
   facilities have been negotiated as needed by the LCP, PPP must send
   BVCP packets to choose and configure the VINES network-layer
   protocol.  Once BVCP has reached the Opened state, VINES datagrams
   can be sent over the link.

   The link will remain configured for communications until explicit LCP
   or BVCP packets close the link down, or until some external event
   occurs (an inactivity timer expires or network administrator
   intervention).



1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.

   MUST      This word, or the adjective "required", means that the
             definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

   MUST NOT  This phrase means that the definition is an absolute
             prohibition of the specification.

   SHOULD    This word, or the adjective "recommended", means that there
             may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to
             ignore this item, but the full implications must be
             understood and carefully weighed before choosing a
             different course.

   MAY       This word, or the adjective "optional", means that this
             item is one of an allowed set of alternatives.  An
             implementation which does not include this option MUST be
             prepared to interoperate with another implementation which



Senum                     expires January 1994                  [Page 1]
DRAFT                           PPP VNCP                       July 1994


             does include the option.



1.2.  Terminology

   This document frequently uses the following terms:

   datagram  The unit of transmission in the network layer (such as IP).
             A datagram may be encapsulated in one or more packets
             passed to the data link layer.

   frame     The unit of transmission at the data link layer.  A frame
             may include a header and/or a trailer, along with some
             number of units of data.

   packet    The basic unit of encapsulation, which is passed across the
             interface between the network layer and the data link
             layer.  A packet is usually mapped to a frame; the
             exceptions are when data link layer fragmentation is being
             performed, or when multiple packets are incorporated into a
             single frame.

   peer      The other end of the point-to-point link.

   silently discard
             This means the implementation discards the packet without
             further processing.  The implementation SHOULD provide the
             capability of logging the error, including the contents of
             the silently discarded packet, and SHOULD record the event
             in a statistics counter.

2.  A PPP Network Control Protocol for VINES Routing

   The Banyan VINES Control Protocol (BVCP) is responsible for
   configuring, enabling, and disabling the VINES Routing protocol
   modules on both ends of the point-to-point link.  BVCP uses the same
   packet exchange mechanism as the Link Control Protocol (LCP).  BVCP
   packets may not be exchanged until PPP has reached the Network-Layer
   Protocol phase.  BVCP packets received before this phase is reached
   should be silently discarded.

   The VINES Routing Control Protocol is exactly the same as the Link
   Control Protocol [1] with the following exceptions:

   Frame Modifications

      The packet may utilize any modifications to the basic frame format
      which have been negotiated during the Link Establishment phase.

   Data Link Layer Protocol Field

      Exactly one BVCP packet is encapsulated in the PPP Information
      field, where the PPP Protocol field indicates type hex 8035
      (Banyan VINES).

   Code field

      Only Codes 1 through 7 (Configure-Request, Configure-Ack,
      Configure-Nak, Configure-Reject, Terminate-Request, Terminate-Ack
      and Code-Reject) are used.  Other Codes should be treated as
      unrecognized and should result in Code-Rejects.

   Timeouts

      BVCP packets may not be exchanged until PPP has reached the
      Network-Layer Protocol phase.  An implementation should be
      prepared to wait for Authentication and Link Quality Determination
      to finish before timing out waiting for a Configure-Ack or other
      response.  It is suggested that an implementation give up only
      after user intervention or a configurable amount of time.

   Configuration Option Types

      BVCP has a distinct set of Configuration Options.

2.1.  Sending VINES Datagrams

   Before any VINES datagrams may be communicated, PPP must reach the
   Network-Layer Protocol phase, and the Banyan VINES Control Protocol
   must reach the Opened state.

   Exactly one VINES packet is encapsulated in the PPP Information
   field, where the PPP Protocol field indicates type hex 0035 (Banyan
   VINES).  The maximum length of a VINES datagram transmitted over a
   PPP link is the same as the maximum length of the Information field
   of a PPP encapsulated packet.

   The format of the Information field itself is the same as that
   defined in [2].



2.2.  General Considerations

   VINES supports an Address Resolution Protocol, VINES ARP, primarily
   used for address assignment.  Since this protocol is part of VINES
   IP, it is fully supported over VNCP.  VINES also supports a Data-Link
   Echo Protocol (VINES Echo), used to test connectivity to a VINES
   Server in a LAN environment, which is not supported over VNCP.

3.  BVCP Configuration Options

   BVCP Configuration Options allow modifications to the standard
   characteristics of the network-layer protocol to be negotiated.  If a
   Configuration Option is not included in a Configure-Request packet,
   the default value for that Configuration Option is assumed.

   BVCP uses the same Configuration Option format defined for LCP [1],
   with a separate set of Options.

   Up-to-date values of the BVCP Option Type field are specified in the
   most recent "Assigned Numbers" RFC [3].  Current values are assigned
   as follows:

      Value   Option

        1     BV-Link-Type
        2     BV-FRP
        3     BV-RTP


3.1.  BV-Link-Type

   Description

      This Configuration Option provides a way to negotiate the way the
      VINES 4.11 Non-Sequenced Routing Update Protocol (Non-Sequenced
      RTP) will run on the link.  VINES 4.11 handles updates differently
      depending on whether the interface is a LAN type or a WAN type.
      For a LAN type, the full routing table is rebroadcast every update
      interval (90 seconds).  For a WAN type, the full routing table is
      only transmitted for the first 3 update intervals after the link
      comes up.  After that only changes are transmitted (for 5 update
      intervals).  Note that this has no effect if VINES 5.5 (Sequenced
      RTP) is being used.  More information on this can be found in [2].

      By default, the WAN Link Type is used.

   A summary of the BV-Link-Type Configuration Option format is shown
   below.  The fields are transmitted from left to right.

      Link Type

         The Link Type field is one octet and indicates the type of the
         link, as follows:

            Value     Meaning

              1       Link is type WAN
              2       Link is type LAN


3.2.  BV-FRP

   Description

      This Configuration Option provides a way to negotiate the use of
      VINES Fragmentation Protocol (FRP).  This protocol is used to
      allow fragmentation and reassembly of a VINES packet over the
      link.  FRP prepends a two octet fields to every packet going over
      the link that contains a begin and end fragment information and a
      sequence number.  With PPP's default MRU of 1500, FRP is not
      normally needed, and no FRP header would be sent with the VINES
      packet.  If a MRU of less than 1484 is negotiated, FRP will be
      needed to send a full size VINES packet over the link.  More
      information on this can be found in [2].

      By default, FRP is disabled over the link.

   A summary of the BV-FRP Configuration Option format is shown below.
   The fields are transmitted from left to right.

            Value   Meaning

              1     FRP is Enabled
              2     FRP is Disabled


3.3.  BV-RTP

   Description

      This Configuration Option provides a way to negotiate whether RTP
      is used over the link.  If dial-up lines with static routes are
      being used, the use of RTP may be totally suppressed to conserve
      bandwidth on the link.

      By default, RTP is enabled over the link.

   A summary of the BV-RTP Configuration Option format is shown below.
   The fields are transmitted from left to right.
