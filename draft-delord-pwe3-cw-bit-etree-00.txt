Internet Draft           CW bit for use in E-Tree          October 2009 
                                     

Abstract 
    
   The extension described in this document allows a pair of PEs 
   connected via an Ethernet Pseudowire (PW) to signal via the use of
   the Control Word (CW) whether the Ethernet frame encapsulated is 
   coming from a Root AC or a Leaf AC. This allows a PE receiving this
   frame to decide whether it can be forwarded to a Leaf AC or not. 
   Such forward or drop decision is an additional filtering action 
   after the MAC-based forwarding decision. This applies to both P2P PW
   and P2MP PW.

Internet Draft           CW bit for use in E-Tree          October 2009 
                                     

1. Introduction 
    
   This document proposes to use a specific bit within the Control Word
   (CW) present on top of an Ethernet PW for a PE to indicate to a 
   remote PE connected via a Pseudowire (PW) whether the Ethernet frame
   carried comes from a Root AC or a Leaf AC in an E-Tree construct 
   using VPLS. This applies to both P2P PW and P2MP PW.
   
   [RFC4385] describes the preferred design of a Pseudowire Emulation
   Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) Control Word to be used over an MPLS packet 
   switched network. 
 
   [RFC4447] specifies extensions to Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) 
   for PEs to setup PWs. It also describes the procedures for PEs to
   signal to each other whether the CW is to be used or not.   
 
   [RFC4448] describes specifies the encapsulation of Ethernet/802.3 
   PDUs within a PW. 
    
2. Terminology

   E-Tree 
   
   An Ethernet VPN in which each Root AC can communicate with every
   other type of AC, whereas Leaf ACs can only communicate with Root
   ACs. Each AC on an E-Tree construct is designated as either a Root
   AC or a Leaf AC. There can be multiple Root ACs and Leaf ACs per 
   E-Tree construct.

   Root AC 

   An ingress frame at a Root AC can be delivered to one or more of
   any of the other ACs in the E-Tree. Please note that this AC is
   bidirectional.

   Leaf AC 
   
   Ingress frame at a Leaf AC can only be delivered to one or more Root
   ACs in the E-Tree. Ingress frame at a Leaf AC MUST NOT be delivered
   to any Leaf ACs in the E-Tree. Please note that this AC is 
   bidirectional.

   3. Scope and Applicability 
    
   3.1. Scope & Problem
    
   One important application for carriers is the deployment of E-Tree
   services over an MPLS backbone using VPLS.

                  Figure 1. E-Tree over MPLS using VPLS 

   Figure 1 describes a typical use case where PE1 and PE2 need to 
   establish an E-Tree construct between different Ethernet endpoints. 
   Each PE has 2 ACs connected to a VSI. These VSIs are then linked 
   together via an Ethernet PW.

   AC1 is a Root AC on PE1 and AC2 is a Leaf AC on PE1.

   AC3 is a Root AC on PE2 and AC4 is a Leaf AC on PE2.
  
   With an E-Tree construct:
      - AC1 can receive from and transmit to AC2, AC3 and AC4
      - AC3 can receive from and transmit to AC1, AC2 and AC4
      - AC2 and AC4 can receive from and transmit to AC1 and AC3
      - AC2 and AC4 cannot receive from or transmit to each other
 
   When an Ethernet Frame is received on PE1 via AC1, the frame can be 
   transmitted to AC2 and via the Ethernet PW connecting PE1 and PE2 to
   AC3 and AC4.

   However when an Ethernet Frame is received on PE1 via AC2, the frame
   can be transmitted to AC3 via the Ethernet PW but not to AC4.

   When PE2 receives an Ethernet frame from PE1 via the Ethernet PW, 
   there is no indication whether it is from AC1 or AC2, PE2 is 
   therefore unable to decide whether it can be forwarded to AC4 as per
   the E-Tree construct.
   
   3.2. Applicability 
    
   The proposed approach in this document will allow PE2 to make a 
   decision for each Ethernet frame arriving on the PW from PE1 whether
   this frame can be forwarded towards a Leaf AC.
   
   Obviously, each PE is also responsible for locally identifying which
   ACs are Root ACs or Leaf ACs and for not forwarding Ethernet frames 
   between Leaf ACs. Most common procedure for doing so is to apply a 
   split horizon rule between Leaf ACs. However this is out of scope of
   this document.

   4. Control Word Extensions 
    
   4.1. Ethernet Control Word Reserved Bit 
        
   [RFC4448] defines in section 4.6 the CW format for an Ethernet PW.
    
   The Control Word defined in this section is based on the Generic PW
   MPLS Control Word as defined in [RFC4385].  It provides the ability
   to sequence individual frames on the PW, avoidance of equal-cost
   multiple-path load-balancing (ECMP), and Operations and
   Management (OAM) mechanisms including VCCV.

   The Control Word is defined as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |0 0 0 0|L| Reserved            |       Sequence Number         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   In the above diagram, the first 4 bits MUST be set to 0 to indicate
   PW data.  

   Leaf bit (L). 
   
   The L-bit is used to flag the presence of an Ethernet frame from
   a Leaf AC as follows:

       L = 1 The Ethernet Frame comes from a Leaf AC
       L = 0 The Ethernet Frame comes from a Root AC

   The rest of the first 16 bits are reserved for future use. They MUST 
   be set to 0 when transmitting, and MUST be ignored upon receipt.

Internet Draft           CW bit for use in E-Tree          October 2009 
                                     

   The next 16 bits provide a sequence number that can be used to
   guarantee ordered frame delivery.  The processing of the sequence
   number field is OPTIONAL.

   The sequence number space is a 16-bit, unsigned circular space.  The
   sequence number value 0 is used to indicate that the sequence number
   check algorithm is not used.  The sequence number processing
   algorithm is found in [RFC4385].

   5. Procedures 
       
   [RFC4447] defines the procedures by which PEs maintain and exchange   
   PW information via LDP.  
    
   This document does not change any of the procedures defined in 
   [RFC4447]. The rules for negociating the use of the CW are defined 
   in section 6.  
    
   5.1. Detailed PE PW Setup Procedures 
    
   In order for a PEs to signal if an Ethernet frame travelling on an 
   Ethernet PW comes from a Root AC or a Leaf AC, it MUST use the 
   extension defined in this document.
   
   The procedure MUST follow the standard procedures described in 
   [RFC4447].
   
   The Label Mapping messages that are sent in order to set up these 
   PWs MUST have c=1.  When a Label Mapping message for a PW of one 
   of these types is received and c=0, a Label Release message MUST
   be sent, with an "Illegal C-bit" status code.  In this case, the 
   PW will not be enabled. 

   5.2. Detailed PE Forwarding Procedures
   
   5.2.1. Forwarding PE
 
   The L-bit MUST only be used when the first 4 bits of the CW are 
   equal to 0000.

   The L-bit MUST be set to 0 when the first 4 bits of the CW are equal
   to 0001.

   If the Ethernet frame that has to be sent across an Ethernet PW (or
   set of Ethernet PWs) comes from a Root AC, the L bit MUST be set to
   0.

   If the Ethernet frame that has to be sent across an Ethernet PW (or 
   set of Ethernet PWs) comes from a Leaf AC, the L bit MUST be set to
   1.

5.2.2 Receiving PE
   
   Upon reception of an Ethernet Frame where the L bit in the CW is set
   to 0, this frame can be forwarded to any AC belonging to this VPN 
   instance.

   Upon reception of an Ethernet Frame where the L bit in the CW is set
   to 1, this frame can be forwarded to any Root AC belonging to this 
   VPN instance but it MUST NOT be forwarded to any Leaf AC. This 
   forward or drop decision is an additional filtering action after the
   MAC-based forwarding decision.

6. Security Considerations 
    
   This section will be added in a future version.

7. IANA Considerations 
    
   There are no specific IANA considerations in this document.
