    A WebSocket handshake proposal using Upgrade and CONNECT masking
                 draft-cridland-hybi-upgrade-connect-00

Abstract

   This document proposes a handshake design for WebSockets based on an
   Upgrade with a first-frame of a pseudo-request CONNECT.

Internet-Draft     Websocket Upgrade/CONNECT handshake     December 2010


1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

   Formal Syntax are to be considered normative, and are specified using
   [ABNF].  Where a formal syntax and the prose are in conflict, the
   formal syntax takes precedence.

   This document uses two terms not well-defined elsewhere: Firstly, the
   websocket metadata is the data exchanged during the setup of the
   websocket proper, and secondly the websocket payload is the data
   exchanged within websocket frames.  The frames as a whole make up the
   websocket data flow.


2.  Introduction

   The pure CONNECT based handshake outlined in [CONNECT] suffers from
   three problems.  Firstly, it is not conceptually HTTP - it
   deliberately breaks that model in order to avoid manipulation by
   transparent proxies.  Secondly, it is either reliant on IP-based
   routing, or else breaks semantic transparency of intermediaries.
   Thirdly, the protocol cannot be routed internally through a server
   without knowledge of the WebSocket spec, thus causing tight coupling
   within the server.

   However, many of its properties are very good, in particular it
   successfully defeats the vast majority of inadvertant attempts to
   treat the websocket payload data as HTTP request/response flows.
   Since this incorrect interpretation by intermediaries is known to
   provide an attack vector for cache poisoning, this is a highly
   desirable feature.

   On the other hand, the Upgrade+Hello proposal provides good fallback
   capability (being based on the HTTP Upgrade mechanism which itself
   has good fallback), and provides good feedback to applications that
   the WebSocket setup has completed.


3.  The Upgrade+CONNECT proposal

   This proposal uses features from both handshake proposals, in order
   to provide an HTTP compliant handshake with good failure properties
   and fallback capability.

   In order to setup a WebSocket, a client first sends a suitable

Internet-Draft     Websocket Upgrade/CONNECT handshake     December 2010


   fallback request along with the following additional header fields
   set:
   Sec-WebSocket-Nonce  A random string selected by the browser (ie, not
      the Javascript).  This string MUST contain no whitespace.
   Sec-Websocket-Metadata  Metadata, base64 encoded.
   Connection  This MUST be "Upgrade".
   Upgrade  This MUST be Websocket.

   Other header fields MAY be specified, for the purposes of the
   fallback request handling.

   The server SHOULD respond with a 101 response.  If it does so, it
   MUST include a Sec-Websocket-Result header field containing the HMAC
   of the metadata - without base64 - keyed by the nonce, and also a
   Sec-Websocket-Server-Nonce header field with a random string chosen
   by the server.  AGain, this string MUST contain no whitespace.

   After verifying the 101 response, the client then performs an HMAC of
   the metadata, keyed by the server's nonce, and sends the following
   strings:
      "CONNECT websocket.invalid:443 HTTP/1.1" CR LF
      "Host: websocket.invalid" CR LF
      "Connection: close" CR LF
      "Sec-Websocket-Final: "
      The client's HMAC as above, hex encoded.
      CR LF CR LF

   Note that although this forms the same essential syntax as a CONNECT
   request, this is not an HTTP request - rather it is the first portion
   of WebSocket payload, and completes the handshake.

   On the receipt of this final handshake step, WebSocket framing can
   start and payload data can be exchanged.


4.  IANA Considerations

   None - maybe header field name registrations?


5.  Security Considerations

   There is some discussion about whether the websocket payload can,
   even after a CONNECT, be used for cache poisoning.  However, the
   experiment by Adam Barth et al clearly demonstrates that if this
   occurs at all, it is less than a 1:50,000 chance of finding such a
   proxy, and therefore my beleif based on this evidence is that there
   is no need to mask the payload itself.

   Although this design does not encrypt the metadta, it does constrain
   its form (by base64 encoding it) such that an attacker cannot inject
   headers or additional requests.


6.  Acknowledgements

   This is transparently just gluing together several other people's
   ideas and passing them off in some way as my own.  Adam Barth, Eric
   Rescorla, and Greg Wilkins all deserve credit, as do other members of
   the Hybi Working Group.
