                        draft-mrw-dvne-fw-00.txt

Abstract

   This document discusses the management and configuration requirements
   for large Virtual Networks (VNs).  VNs are private networks that
   employ tunneling technologies to overlay private network links over
   physical IP networks.

   As VNs grow, the amount of administrative effort required to manually
   configure virtual nodes and to set up the required tunnels becomes
   prohibitive.  The DVNE protocol automates this process, elminating
   much of the administrative work involved in setting up a virtual
   network.

1.  Introduction

   This document discusses the management and configuration requirements
   for large Virtual Networks (VNs).  VNs are private networks that
   employ tunneling technologies to overlay private network links over
   physical IP networks.

   As VNs grow, the amount of administrative effort required to manually
   configure virtual nodes, and to set up the required tunnels, becomes
   prohibitive.  The DVNE protocol automates this process, eliminating
   much of the administrative work involved in setting up a virtual
   network.


2.  Applicability

   IPsec [RFC4301] site-to-site VPNs [RFC3809] are widely deployed in
   enterprise networks.  IPsec gateways located anywhere on the Internet
   are virtual network nodes which are responsible for initiating/
   terminating IPsec tunnels and encapsulating/decapsulating IPsec
   packets.  Every IPsec gateway should be configured with the addresses
   of the gateway(s) to be tunneled to and the parameters pertaining to
   the tunnel.  It might be configured with the routing protocol(s) to
   be used after the tunnel has been established and any other
   configuration needed for virtual network connectivity.  As the number
   of such gateways increases, the scalability issues would arise.  When
   an IPsec gateway join or leave, the configuration of each gateway
   would be updated.

   Some people and companies have very dynamic networking needs.  Small
   or medium size companies might find the IT costs of deploying a
   complete VPN infrastructure could not be justified.  They may have
   their access device(s) connected to the Internet via xDSL or the ISP
   deploys CGN [I-D. nishitani-cgn] in its networks.  It is challenging
   to manually configure these access devices as virtual network nodes
   to construct a virtual network, since they have dynamic addresses and
   imposed on some communication constraints (by CGN).  Such dynamic
   nature might also apply to an individual person or a family.  A
   person might like to access his home network which might locate
   behind NAT devices from anywhere over the Internet by auto-
   configuring his home gateway and handset for media sharing.


3.  Problem Statement

   Constructing a virtual network traversing physical IP networks
   encounters 2 major problems:




Wasserman & Nallur       Expires April 21, 2011                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               DVNE Framework                 October 2010


   o  When the size of virtual networks grows, the configuration and
      management burden is overwhelming.  For example, when a virtual
      network node joins a virtual network, the needed parameters should
      be provisioned to the new comer, and changes would be propagated
      to the existing virtual network nodes.

   o  The dynamic natural of virtual networks, such as addresses
      assigned dynamically to virtual network nodes for the Internet
      connection, would make static configuration and manual
      configuration impossible.


4.  Terminology

   o  Virtual Network (VN): an overlay network connecting VN nodes based
      on physical networks along with the edge networks to which VN
      nodes attach.

   o  DVNE: An approach to configure and manage virtual networks based
      on the provision of dedicated servers, called Mediators.

   o  Mediator: Functional element of DVNE.  Servers for configuring and
      managing VNs.  The administrator(s) can configure with the
      Mediator VN construction policy and the Mediator in turn configure
      with the designated or qualified VN nodes.

   o  VN node: Functional element of DVNE.  The node connected to the
      Internet which is responsible for initialing/terminating tunnels
      or encapsulating/decapsulating encapsulated packets.  All VN nodes
      belonging to the same VN form an overlay network.  VN node can
      connect to edge networks to the overlay network.


5.  DVNE Model

   DVNE Mediators are configuration managers that help configure virtual
   network connectivity to virtual network nodes already connected to
   the Internet.  The Mediator may be a server or a cluster.  For
   discovery purpose, the DNS names or addresses of the Mediator could
   be pre-configured, referenced on web pages, provisioned via DHCP
   [RFC2131][RFC3315] or DNS lookup.

   The DVNE model is based on the set of functional elements depicted in
   figure 1.

                 Figure 1: Simple DVNE configuration



5.1.  Mediator

   The Mediator is the place where the VN nodes connect to register and
   activate their presence in the virtual network.  The mediator
   configures with VN nodes the necessary parameters for creating,
   modifying or deleting a virtual network either automatically or by
   request.

   A Mediator must be IPv4 addressable.  It must be reached by all VN
   nodes (i.e., without NAT traversal needed).

5.2.  VN Nodes

   VN nodes function in the virtual network as routers or hosts.  If a
   VN node is a VN router, it is followed by an edge network consisting
   of one or more physical hosts.  After the configuration order is
   received from the Mediator, the VN node set up tunnels, exchange
   routing information and data forwarding, etc. accordingly.

5.3.  Using DVNE Service

   Administrators configure parameters for VN construction with the
   Mediator instead of going to every single VN node.  The configuration
   between the admin and the Mediator can be achieved by interactive
   commands, Web pages or any other alternative means.  The
   configuration parameters may contain the topology of the overlay
   network (i.e., hub-and-spokes or hub), the function type of specific
   VN nodes (i.e., router or host), the tunneling method (e.g., IPsec),



Wasserman & Nallur       Expires April 21, 2011                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               DVNE Framework                 October 2010


   the routing protocols (e.g., OSPF) or routing lookup method (e.g.,
   via DNS lookup), etc.  The Mediator will configure each VN node
   accordingly when the VN node registers.  We called this process as
   administrative configuration.

   Approaching the Mediator, the VN node should be asked first of all to
   provide its identity and credentials so that proper user
   authentication, authorization and accounting can be carried out
   (e.g., relying on existing AAA facilities such as RADIUS).  This
   means the VN node and the Mediator have to share a pre-configured or
   automatically established security association to be used to prevent
   unauthorized use of the service.  With this respect the Mediator can
   be seen as an access-control server for VN nodes.

   After successful authentication, the VN node may register further
   information with the Mediator such as the IP address to which it is
   attaching and/or request such as function type it would like (i.e.,
   router or host), etc.  In response, the Mediator configures the VN
   node according to administrative configuration and the request if
   exists.  The configuration may contain the addresses of any other VN
   nodes (which might be registered by the corresponding VN nodes in
   advance), the tunneling method (e.g., IPsec), the routing protocols
   used upon established tunnels or routing lookup method (e.g., name
   service lookup) used for next-hop determination, etc.

5.4.  VN Address Assignment

   IP address should be assigned to the VN nodes and any edge network
   they connect.  Automatic addressing, e.g., DHCP is recommended in
   this case not only because it is automatic but also it helps avoid
   addressing conflict if used well.  Besides, the address allocation
   record can be used for next-hop determination when routing protocol
   is not used.

   The lifetime of these dynamically assigned VN addresses should be
   relatively long and potentially longer than the lifetime of the
   connection of the VN nodes to the Mediator.  This is to allow the VN
   node to get semipermanent VN addresses even though it gets
   dynamically assigned IPv4 addresses through DHCP for access to the
   Internet.

5.5.  Tunnel Establishment

   The Mediator configures a VN node with adequate information to create
   tunnels.  E.g., it may provide a VN node the address of another VN
   node it attempts to tunnel to, the tunneling method (and
   encapsulation options).  The Mediator may provide extra information
   in aid of tunnel setup authentication.  E.g., it may relay

   fingerprint of certificates for each other [RFC4572].

   DVNE at this stage only considers the case where all VN nodes attach
   to the same virtual link, i.e., a VN node can reach each other VN
   node in the virtual network in one-hop.  There are two major
   topologies to consider for overlay networks.  In the hub-and-spokes
   case, the spoke nodes should be configured with hub nodes' address.
   In the mesh case, each node should be configured with other nodes'
   address.

   Things get complicated if one or both VN nodes are behind NAT
   devices.  The registered address when a VN node logs in may be
   meaningless for other VN nodes if the VN node is behind NAT devices
   whatever the VN node wants to connect to or connected by another VN
   node.  In that case, the Mediator may configure STUN and/or TURN

   servers' addresses to a VN node and coordinate with ICE to work out
   the effective or efficient address pairs for connectivity.  [I-D.
   saito-mmusic-sdp-ike] presents an alternative approach for IKE/IPsec
   tunnels establishment with NAT traversal using SIP/SDP model.

   Tunneling configuration adjust to NAT traversal.  E.g., when NAT
   devices comes in between, UDP encapsulation of IPsec tunneling
   [RFC3948] is preferred whereas TLS tunneling is preferred without the
   presence of NAT.

5.6.  Next Hop Determination

   Routing protocols could be used for the virtual network routing after
   tunnels have been established.  When routing protocols are not
   available or too costly, other alternatives should be considered.  In
   hub-and-spokes case, the Mediator would configure the spokes nodes
   with a default route to the hub node.  In mesh case, the Mediator
   would configure each node with routes to other nodes and update the
   routes over time.  Instead, VN nodes can request routes from the
   Mediator or DNS name servers when they are ready to forward VN
   packets (in which case, the address of these DNS servers should be
   configured in advance).  The tunnels can be established as described
   above before or after the routes have been configured.

5.7.  Interaction Between DVNE Entities

   The definition of a specific set of protocols and procedures to be
   used for the communication among the various entities in the DVNE
   architecture is outside of the scope of the present framework
   document.  Nevertheless, in the reminder of this section some viable
   technical alternatives to support admin-Mediator, Mediator-node, and
   node-node interaction are briefly described in order to help future
   implementation efforts or standardization initiatives.

   The administrator could configure parameters for VN construction with
   the Mediator via SSH, HTTP, SNMP, NETCONF or any other alternate
   methods.  All the se methods are secure.

   A VN node should register some information (e.g., its addresses)
   and/or request configuration to the Mediator.  In response, the
   Mediator should configure the VN node with addressing, routing,
   tunneling, etc.  The Mediator may configure the VN node with STUN/
   TURN server's address if the VN node is behind NAT device(s).  In
   that case, both VN nodes and the Mediator may be integrated with ICE
   mechanism to achieve NAT traversal.  Other than the VN related
   configuration and policies, the Mediator may relay referrals to two
   VN nodes that are willing to setup tunnels with each other for better
   connectivity.  [I-D. carpenter-behave-referral-object] tries to

   standardize a generic referral objects and GROBJ BoF at this writing
   time is undertaking related tasks.

   When two VN nodes choose a pair of addresses for connectivity, one
   node can initiate a tunnel to the other node according to the
   administrative configuration or request.  DVNE assumes the tunnel
   method is IPsec All the interaction between the functional elements
   of the proposed architecture need to be secured:

   o  The interaction between the Mediator and the administrator;

   o  The interaction between a VN node and the Mediator;

   o  The interaction between VN nodes.

   The Mediator should impose a strong method to authenticate the
   administrator, for example, using X.509 certificate issued by a
   trusted Certification Authority.  The configuration data between the
   Mediator and the administrator usually exchange in an interactive
   mode, SSH, TLS or any other alternative means can protect the
   integrity and confidentiality of the configuration data.

   The Mediator should impose a strong or moderate method to
   authenticate the VN node and let the authorized VN node join the VN.
   A moderate method could be using TLS as secure tunnel and using
   username/password method to do actual authentication since X.509
   certificate might be costly in some circumstances.  The integrity and
   confidentiality can be achieved by using TLS or any other alternative
   means to protect the data.

   The VN nodes use tunneling technologies which are out of the scope of
   this document should accommodate NAT traversal.  For example, UDP
   encapsulation of ESP would be used for IPsec works in the presence of
   NAT. for tunneling authentication, the Mediator can act as a proxy to
   relay the authentication credentials or share pre-secret or
   distribute session key for tunneled data encap/decap.  The security
   for tunneled data is dependent on which tunnel technology you used.
   Security issues for tunnels are addressed in specific tunneling
   specification or relevant documents and out of the scope of this doc.

   Finally, the Mediator must implement protections against denial of
   service attacks which may occur whenever a malicious user exhausts
   all the resources available on the Mediator.  A possible protection
   against this attack could be achieved by administratively limiting
   the VN scale and the number of VNs supported simultaneously.tunnel
   and IPsec tunnel over UDP (when NAT traversal is needed).  Other
   alternatives like SSL, L2TP, GRE should be considered later.
