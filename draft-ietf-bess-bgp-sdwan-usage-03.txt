                    draft-ietf-bess-bgp-sdwan-usage-03

Abstract

   The document discusses the usage and applicability of BGP as the
   control plane for multiple SDWAN scenarios. The document aims to
   demonstrate how the BGP-based control plane is used for large-scale
   SDWAN overlay networks with little manual intervention.

   SDWAN edge nodes are commonly interconnected by multiple types of
   underlay networks owned and managed by different network providers.

1. Introduction

   SDWAN optimizes transport of IP Packets over multiple underlay
   connectivity services. Here are some of the main characteristics of
   "SDWAN" networks:

     - Augment of transport, which refers to utilizing paths over
       different underlay networks. Very often, there are multiple
       parallel overlay paths between any two SDWAN edges; some of them
       are private networks over which traffic can traverse with or
       without encryption; others require encryption, e.g., over
       untrusted public networks.
     - Direct Internet breakout from remote branch offices is allowed
       instead of all traffic hauled to Corporate HQ for centralized
       policy control.
     - Some traffic can be forwarded based on their application
       identifiers instead of based on destination IP addresses by the

       edge nodes placing the traffic onto specific overlay paths based
       on the application-specific policies.
     - The traffic forwarding can also be based on specific performance
       criteria (e.g., packets delay, packet loss, jitter) to provide
       better application performance by choosing the underlay that
       meets or exceeds the specified policies.

   [Net2Cloud-Problem] describes the network-related problems to
   connect enterprises' branch offices to dynamic workloads in
   different Cloud Data Centers (DC). SDWAN has been positioned as a
   flexible way to reach dynamic workloads in third-party Cloud DCs.
   However, scaling becomes a significant issue when hundreds or
   thousands of nodes need to be interconnected by SDWAN overlay
   networks.

   This document describes using BGP as the control plane to scale
   large SDWAN overlay networks.

3. Use Case Scenario Description and Requirements

   This section describes some essential requirements for SDWAN
   networks and several SDWAN scenarios used by the subsequent sections
   to explain how the BGP control plane is applied.

3.1. Requirements

3.1.1. Supporting SDWAN Segmentation

   "SDWAN Segmentation" is a frequently used term in SDWAN deployment,
   referring to policy-driven network partitioning. An SDWAN segment is
   a virtual private network (SDWAN VPN) consisting of a set of edge
   nodes interconnected by the tunnels, such as IPsec tunnels and MPLS
   VPN tunnels.

   This document assumes that an SDWAN VPN configuration on a PE
   follows the same way as MPLS VPN, i.e., via VRFs. One SDWAN VPN can
   be mapped to one or multiple SD-WAN virtual topologies, governed by
   the SDWAN controller's policies.

   When using BGP for SDWAN, the Client Route UPDATE is the same as
   MPLS VPN. Route Target in the BGP Extended Community is used to
   differentiate routes belonging to different SDWAN VPNs.

   As SDWAN is an overlay network arching over multiple types of
   networks, MPLS L2VPN/L3VPN or pure L2 underlay can continue using
   the VPN ID, VN-ID, or VLAN in the data plane to differentiate
   packets belonging to different SDWAN VPNs. For packets carried by an
   IPsec tunnel, the IPsec's inner encapsulation header can have the
   SDWAN VPN Identifier to distinguish the packets belonging to
   different SDWAN VPNs.

3.1.2. Client Service Requirement

   The Client interface of SDWAN nodes can be IP or Ethernet-based.

   For Ethernet-based client interfaces, SDWAN edge should support
   VLAN-based service interfaces (EVI100), VLAN bundle service
   interfaces (EVI200), or VLAN-Aware bundling service interfaces. EVPN
   service requirements apply to the Client traffic, as described in
   Section 3.1 of RFC8388.

   For IP-based client interfaces, L3VPN service requirements are
   applicable.

3.1.3. Application Flow Based Segmentation

   Application Flow based segmentation enables the separation of the
   traffic based on the business and the security needs of the
   applications. Different applications may require different virtual
   topologies or policies. The Application Flow based segmentation can
   be provided for a single SDWAN subscriber.

   For example, a retail business requires the point-of-sales (PoS)
   application to be on a different virtual topology from other
   applications. The PoS application is routed only to the payment
   processing entity at a hub site; other applications can be routed to
   all other sites.

   The traffic from the PoS application follows a Tree topology in the
   figure below, whereas other traffic can be multipoint-to-multipoint
   topology.

                              +--------+
              Payment traffic |Payment |

              /      /      |      |          |      \     \

              |       |       |    |      |       |       |
            ==+=======+=======+====+======+=======+=======+===
                  Multi-point connection for Other traffic

   Another example is an enterprise that wants to isolate the traffic
   from different departments, with each department having a unique
   topology and policy. The HR department may need to access specific
   applications that are NOT accessible by the engineering department.
   Also, the contractors may have limited access to the enterprise
   resources.

3.1.4. Zero Touch Provisioning

   SDWAN zero-tour provisioning (ZTP) allows devices to be configured
   and provisioned centrally. When an SDWAN edge is installed at a
   remote location, ZTP automates follow-up steps, including updates to
   the OS, software version, and configuration before client traffic
   being forwarded. The ZTP can bootstrap a remote SDWAN node and
   establish a secure connection to the local SDWAN Controller, making
   it convenient to add or delete an SDWAN edge node (virtual or
   physical). From the network control perspective, ZTP includes the
   following:

     -   Upon power-up, an SDWAN node can establish the transport layer
     secure connection (such as TLS, SSL, etc.) to its controller,
     whose address can be burned or preconfigured on the device.


Dunbar, et al.         Expires October 20, 2021                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            BGP Usage for SDWAN            April 23, 2021

     -   The SDWAN Controller can designate a local network controller
     in the proximity of the SDWAN node. Like the Route-Reflector (RR)
     for BGP controlled SDWAN, the local network controller manages and
     monitors the communication policies for traffic to/from the edge
     node.


3.1.5. Constrained Propagation of SDWAN Edge Properties

   One SDWAN edge node may only be authorized to communicate with a
   small number of other SDWAN edge nodes. Under this circumstance, the
   property of the SDWAN edge node cannot be propagated to other nodes
   that are not authorized to communicate. But a remote SDWAN edge
   node, upon powering up, might not have the right policies to know
   which peers are authorized to communicate. Therefore, SDWAN
   deployment needs to have a central point to distribute the
   properties of an SDWAN edge node to its authorized peers.

   BGP is well suited for this purpose. RFC 4684 has specified the
   procedure to constrain the distribution of BGP UPDATE to only a
   subset of nodes. Each edge node informs the Route-Reflector (RR)
   [RFC4456] on its interested SDWAN VPNs. The RR only propagates the
   BGP UPDATE for the relevant SDWAN VPNs to the edge.

   The connection between an SDWAN edge node and its RR can be over an
   insecure network. Therefore, an SDWAN node needs to establish a
   secure transport layer connection (TLS, SSL, etc.) to its designated
   RR upon power-up. The BGP UPDATE messages need to be sent over the
   secure channel (TLS, SSL, etc.) to the RR.

   Tenant separation is achieved by the SDWAN VPN identifiers
   represented in the control plane and data plane, respectively.



3.2. Scenario #1: Homogeneous WAN

   Homogeneous WAN refers to a type of SDWAN network with edge nodes
   encrypting all traffic over WAN to other edge nodes, regardless of
   whether the underlay is private or public. For lack of better
   terminology, we call this Homogeneous SDWAN throughout this
   document.

   Some typical scenarios for the use of a Homogeneous SDWAN network
   are as follows:

   -  A small branch office to connect to its HQ offices via the
   Internet. All sensitive traffic to/from this small branch office
   must be encrypted, usually achieved by IPsec Tunnels.

   -  A store in a shopping mall may need to securely connect to its
   applications in one or more Cloud DCs via the Internet. A common way
   of achieving this is to establish IPsec SAs to the Cloud DC gateway
   to carry the sensitive data to/from the store.

   As described in [SECURE-EVPN], the granularity of the IPsec SAs for
   Homogeneous SDWAN can be per site, per subnet, per tenant, or
   address. Once the IPsec SA is established for a specific
   subnet/tenant/site, all traffic to/from the subnets/tenants/site is
   encrypted.

                      Figure 2: Homogeneous SDWAN

   One of the properties of a homogeneous SDWAN is that the SDWAN Local
   Network Controller (RR)might be connected to C-PEs via an untrusted
   public network, therefore, requiring a secure connection between RR
   and C-PEs (TLS, DTLS, etc.).

   Homogeneous SDWAN has some similarity to commonly deployed IPsec
   VPN, albeit the IPsec VPN is usually point-to-point among a small
   number of nodes and with heavy manual configuration for IPsec
   between nodes. In contrast, an SDWAN network can have many edge
   nodes and has a central controller to manage the configurations on
   the edge nodes.

   Existing Private VPNs (e.g., MPLS based) can use homogeneous SDWAN
   to extend over the public network to remote sites to which the VPN
   operator does not own or lease infrastructural connectivity, as
   described in [SECURE-EVPN] and [SECURE-L3VPN]

3.3. Scenario #2: Hybrid WAN Underlay

   Since IPsec requires additional processing power and the encrypted
   traffic over the Internet does not have the premium SLA commonly
   offered by Private VPNs, especially over a long distance, it is more
   desired for traffic over private VPN to be forwarded without
   encryption. The Hybrid WAN Underlay scenario refers to an SDWAN
   network in which traffic over IP VPN is forwarded natively without

Internet-Draft            BGP Usage for SDWAN            April 23, 2021

   IPsec protection. IPsec tunnels protect only the traffic sent over
   the public Internet.

   One C-PE might have the Internet-facing WAN ports managed by
   different ISPs/NSPs with the WAN ports' addresses assigned by the
   corresponding ISPs/NSPs. Clients might have policies to specify:

   1) Some flows can only be forwarded over private VPNs.
   2) Some flows can be forwarded over either private VPNs or public
     Inter. The packets over the public Internet are encrypted.
   3) Some flows, especially Internet-bound browsing ones, can be handed
     off to the Internet without any encryption.

   Suppose a flow, traversing multiple segments such as A<->B<->C<->D,
   has the Policy 2) above. The flow can cross different underlays in
   different segments, such as over Private underlay between A<->B
   without encryption or over the public Internet between B<->C
   protected by an IPsec SA.

   As shown in the figure below, C-PE-1 has two different types of
   interfaces (A1 to Internet and A2 & A3 to VPN). The C-PE's loopback
   address and the C-PE attached client addresses may or may not be
   visible to the ISPs/NSPs. The WAN ports' addresses can be allocated
   by the service providers or dynamically assigned (e.g., by DHCP).

     Also, the connection between C-PEs and their Controller (RR) might
     be via the untrusted public network. It is necessary to encrypt
     the communication between RR and C-PEs, by TLS, DTLS, etc.

     There could be multiple SDWAN edges (C-PEs) sharing common
     property, such as a geographic location. Some applications over
     SDWAN may need to traverse specific geographic areas for various
     reasons, such as to comply with regulatory rules, to utilize
     specific value-added services, or others.

     Services may not be congruent, i.e., the packets from A-> B may
     traverse one underlay network, and the packets from B -> A may go
     over a different underlay.



3.4. Scenario #3: Private VPN PE based SDWAN

   This scenario refers to the existing VPN (e.g., EVPN or IPVPN) being
   expanded by adding extra ports facing the untrusted Internet for PEs
   to offload low-priority traffic when the VPN paths are congested.



Dunbar, et al.         Expires October 20, 2021               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft            BGP Usage for SDWAN            April 23, 2021

   Throughout this document, this scenario is also called Internet
   Offload for Private VPN, or PE-based SDWAN.

   Here are some differences from the Hybrid Underlay scenario (Section
   3.3):

       - For MPLS-based VPN, PEs would have MPLS as payload
          encapsulated within the IPsec tunnel egressing the Internet
          WAN ports, MPLS-in-IP/GRE-in-IPsec.
       - The BGP RR is connected to PEs in the same way as VPN, i.e.,
          via the trusted network.

   The PE-based SDWAN can be used by VPN service providers to
   temporarily increase bandwidth between sites when not sure if the
   demand will sustain for an extended period or as a temporary
   solution before the permanent infrastructure is built or leased.

4. Provisioning Model

4.1. Client Service Provisioning Model

   Client service provisioning can follow the same approach as MPLS
   VRFs. A client VPN can establish the communication policy by
   specifying the Route Targets to be imported and exported.
   Alternatively, traditional Match and Action ACLs can identify the
   specific routes allowed or denied to or from the client VPN.



Dunbar, et al.         Expires October 20, 2021               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft            BGP Usage for SDWAN            April 23, 2021

   For an SDWAN edge node dedicated to one subscriber with one virtual
   network, provisioning can be automated. All the prefixes attached to
   the client port(s) of the edge node can be considered in one VRF,
   and the RR can manage the policies for import/export of the VRF.

4.2. Policy Configuration

   One of the characteristics of an SDWAN service is that packets can
   be forwarded over multiple types of underlays. Policies are needed
   to govern which underlay paths an application flow can be forwarded,
   as specified by Section 8 of MEF70.1.

   An application flow is a subset of IP packets that arrive at client
   ports that match the application flow specification, which can be
   fields extracted from the packets combined with the ports the
   packets come in. For example, Client-prefix-x can only be mapped to
   MPLS topology.

   Some SDWAN services need DNS Application list configuration to
   enable the split DNS.

4.3. IPsec related parameters Provisioning

   For the IPsec tunnel to be established, the SDWAN edge nodes need to
   support the common IPsec encryption algorithms (DES, 3DES, or AES),
   the hash algorithm (SHA or MD5), and the DH groups. Each SDWAN edge
   node can have the default supported values for those attributes or
   get the attributes from its controller to minimize the
   configuration. For BGP-controlled SDWAN, BGP UPDATE messages can
   propagate each node's IPsec related attributes values to other nodes
   for peers to choose the attributes' values supported by both edges
   of an IPsec tunnel.

5. BGP Controlled SDWAN

5.1. BGP Walk Through for Homogeneous SDWAN

   For the BGP-controlled homogeneous SDWAN, a C-PE can advertise its
   attached client routes and the properties of the IPsec tunnel for
   carrying the traffic towards the client routes in one BGP UPDATE
   message.

   In the Figure below, the BGP UPDATE message from C-PE2 to RR can
   have the client routes encoded in the MP-NLRI Path Attribute and the
   IPsec Tunnel associated information encoded in the Tunnel-Encap Path
   Attributes as described in the [SECURE-EVPN].

   Alternatively, the C-PE2 can use two separate BGP UPDATE messages to
   reduce the size of the BGP UPDATE messages, as described by Section
   4 and 8 of [Tunnel-encap]. UPDATE U1 has its Nexthop to the node
   loopback address and is reclusively resolved to the IPsec tunnel
   detailed attributes advertised by the UPDATE U2 for the Node
   Loopback address:

   Here are the details of the UPDATE messages:

     - Suppose that a given packet P destined towards the client
       addresses attached to C-PE2 (e.g., prefix 10.1.x.x/16) can be
       carried by any IPsec tunnels terminated at C-PE2;
     - The path along which P is to be forwarded is determined by BGP
       UPDATE U1;
     - UPDATE U1 does not have a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute;
     - UPDATE U1 can include the Encapsulation Extended Community with
       the option to have the Color Extended Community;
     - The address of the next-hop of UPDATE U1 is router C-PE2;
     - The best route to router C-PE2 is a BGP route advertised in
       UPDATE U2;
     - UPDATE U2 has a Tunnel Encapsulation attribute to describe the
       IPsec detailed attributes.

Internet-Draft            BGP Usage for SDWAN            April 23, 2021

   UPDATE U1:

     - MP-NLRI Path Attribute:
         10.1.x.x/16
         12.1.1.x/24
     - Nexthop: 2.2.2.2 (C-PE2)
     - Encapsulation Extended Community: Type = IPsec



   UPDATE U2:
     - MP-NLRI Path Attribute:
         2.2.2.2 (C-PE2)
     - Tunnel Encapsulation Path Attributes (as described in the
     [SECURE-EVPN])

   If different client routes attached to C-PE2 need to be reached by
   separate IPsec tunnels, the Color-Extended-Community [Tunnel-encap]
   is used to associate routes with the tunnels. See Section 8 of
   [Tunnel-encap].

   Suppose C-PE2 does not have the policy on the authorized peers for
   the specific client routes. In that case, RR needs to check the
   client routes policies to constrain the BGP UPDATE messages
   propagation only to the remote authorized edge nodes.


5.2. BGP Walk Through for Hybrid WAN Underlay

   In this scenario, some client routes can be forwarded by any tunnels
   terminated at the edge node, and some client routes can be sent over
   some specific tunnels (such as only MPLS VPN).

   An edge node can use the Color Extended Community (Section 4 & 8 of
   [Tunnel-Encap]) in its BGP UPDATE message to associate the client
   routes with the specific tunnels.

   For example, in Figure 5 above, suppose that Route 10.1.x.x/16 can
   be carried by either MPLS or IPsec and Route 12.1.1.x/24 can only be
   carried by MPLS; C-PE2 can use the following UPDATE messages:

   UPDATE #1a for Route Route 10.1.x.x/16:

     - MP-NLRI Path Attribute:
         10.1.x.x/16

     - Color Extended Community: RED



   UPDATE #2b: for MPLS-in-GRE terminated at the node:
     - MP-NLRI Path Attribute:
         2.2.2.2 (C-PE2)
     - Tunnel Encapsulation Path Attributes: TYPE=SDWAN-Hybrid
     - Color Extended Community: YELLOW

   SDWAN-Hybrid Tunnel Type is specified by [SDWAN-EDGE-Discovery].

5.3. BGP Walk Through for Application Flow Based Segmentation

   Suppose the application flow can be identified by the source or
   destination IP addresses. In that case, constraining the BGP UPDATE
   messages for the application only to the nodes that meet the
   criteria of the application flow can achieve the Application Flow
   based Segmentation described in Section 3.1.2. In the Figure below,
   the following BGP Updates can be advertised to ensure that the
   Payment Application only communicates with the Payment Gateway:

   BGP UPDATE #1a from C-PE2 to RR for the P2P topology that is only
   propagated to Payment GW node:

   UPDATE #1a (only to the Payment GW node):

5.4. Benefit of Using Recursive Next Hop Resolution

   Using the Recursive Next Hop Resolution described in Section 8 of
   [Tunnel-Encap], the clients' routes UPDATE messages become very
   compact, and any changes of the underlay network tunnels attributes
   can be advertised without client route update. This method is handy
   when the underlay tunnels are IPsec based, which requires periodic
   message exchange for the pairwise re-keying process.

5.5. Why BGP as Control Plane for SDWAN?

   For an SDWAN network with a small number of nodes, the traditional
   hub & spoke model utilizing NHRP or DSVPN/DMVPN protocol had worked
   reasonably well. DSVPN/DMVPN has a hub node (or controller) managing
   the edge nodes, including local & public addresses and tunnel
   identifiers mapping. However, for a sizeable SDWAN network, say more
   than 100 nodes with different underlays, the traditional approach
   becomes very messy, complex, and error prone.

   Here are some of the compelling reasons for using BGP:

   -  With a secure management channel already established between an
   edge node and RR, RR can perform the peer authentication on behalf



Dunbar, et al.         Expires October 20, 2021               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft            BGP Usage for SDWAN            April 23, 2021

   of the edge node. Not only RR has policies on peer communication,
   but RR also has the built-in capability to constrain the propagation
   of the UPDATE messages to the authorized edge nodes [RFC4684].

   - When multiple IPsec tunnels are established between two pairwise
   edge nodes, BGP Tunnel Attribute Update can associate multiple IPsec
   tunnels with the client routes. In traditional IPsec VPN, separate
   routing protocols must run in parallel in each IPsec Tunnel if the
   client routes can be load shared among the IPsec tunnels.

   - The IPsec tunnel's traffic selector or admission control can be
   inherently realized by specifying importing/exporting the Route
   Targets representing the SDWAN VPNs.

6. SDWAN Forwarding Model

   This section describes how client traffic is forwarded in BGP
   Controlled SDWAN for the use cases described in Section 3.

   The procedures described in Section 6 of RFC8388 are applicable for
   the SDWAN client traffic. Like the BGP-based VPN/EVPN client routes
   UPDATE message, Route Target can distinguish routes from different
   clients.

6.1. Forwarding Model for Homogeneous SDWAN

6.1.1. Network and Service Startup Procedures

   A single IPsec security association (SA) protects data in one
   direction. Under the homogeneous SDWAN Scenario, two SAs must be
   present to secure traffic in both directions between two C-PE nodes,
   two client ports, or two prefixes. Using Figure 2 of Section 3.2 as
   an example, for client CN2 attached to C-PE1, C-PE3, and C-PE4 to
   have full-mesh connection, six one-directional IPsec SAs must be
   established: C-PE1 <-> C-PE3; C-PE1 <-> C-PE4; C-PE3 <-> C-PE4.

   SDWAN services to clients can be IP-based or Ethernet-based. An
   SDWAN node can learn client routes from the client-facing ports via
   OSPF, RIP, BGP or Statically configuration for its IP-based
   services. For Layer-2 SDWAN services, the relevant EVPN parameters,
   such as the ESI (Ethernet Segment Identifier), EVI, CE-VID to EVI
   mapping, can be configured in the same way as EVPN described in
   RFC8388.

   Instead of running IGP within each IPsec tunnel as done by the
   traditional IPsec VPN, BGP UPDATE messages propagate the client
   routes attached to SDWAN edge nodes.



Dunbar, et al.         Expires October 20, 2021               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft            BGP Usage for SDWAN            April 23, 2021

   In addition, BGP-RR (SDWAN Controller) facilitates the IPsec SA
   establishment and rekey management described in [SECURE-EVPN]. The
   Controller manages how client's routes are associated with
   individual IPsec SA. Therefore, it is no longer necessary to
   manually configure the IPsec tunnel's endpoint addresses on each
   SDWAN edge node and set up policies for the allowed client prefixes.

6.1.2. Packet Walk-Through

   For an IPsec SA terminated at a C-PE node, multiple client routes
   can be multiplexed in the IPsec SA (or tunnel). Traffic to the
   client prefixes is encapsulated in an inner tunnel, such as GRE or
   VxLAN, carried by the IPsec SA ESP tunnel. Different client traffic
   can be differentiated by a unique value in the inner encapsulation
   key or ID field.

   For unicast packets forwarding:

     the C-PE node address (or loopback address) acts as the Next Hop
     addresses for the prefixes attached to the C-PE nodes.

     C-PE Node-based IPsec tunnel is inherently protected when the C-PE
     has multiple WAN ports to different underlay paths. As shown in
     Figure 2, when one of the underlay paths fails, the IPsec traffic
     can be forwarded to or received from a different physical port.

     When a C-PE receives a packet from its client port, the packet is
     encapsulated inside the IPsec SA, whose destination address
     matches the Next Hop address of the packet's destination and
     forwarded to the target C-PE.

     When a C-PE receives an IPsec encrypted packet from its WAN ports,
     it decrypts the packet and forwards the inner packet to the client
     port based on the inner packet's destination address.

   For multicast packets forwarding:

     IPsec was created to be a security protocol between two and only
     two devices, so multicast service using IPsec is problematic. An
     IPsec peer encrypts a packet so that only one other IPsec peer can
     successfully perform the de-encryption. A straight way to forward
     a multicast packet for the homogeneous SDWAN is to encapsulate the
     multicast packet in separate unicast IPsec SA tunnels. More
     optimized forwarding multicast packets for the homogeneous SDWAN
     is out of the scope of this document.

6.2. Forwarding Model for Hybrid Underlay SDWAN

   In this scenario as shown in Figure 3 of Section 3.3, traffic
   forwarded over the trusted VPN paths can be native (i.e.,
   unencrypted). The traffic forwarded over untrusted networks need to
   be protected by IPsec SA.

6.2.1. Network and Service Startup Procedures

   Infrastructure setup: The proper MPLS infrastructure must be set up
   among the edge nodes, i.e., the C-PE1/C-PE2/C-PE3/C-PE4 of Figure 3.
   The IPsec SA between WAN ports or nodes must be set up as well.
   IPsec SA related attributes on edge nodes can be distributed by BGP
   UPDATE messages as described in Section 5.

   There could be policies governing how flows can be forwarded, as
   specified by MEF70.1.  For example, "Private-only" indicates that
   the flows can only traverse the MPLS VPN underlay paths.

6.2.2. Packet Walk-Through

   For unicast packets forwarding:

     Upon receiving a packet from a client port, if the packet belongs
     to a flow that can only be forwarded over the MPLS VPN, the
     forwarding processing is the same as the MPLS VPN. Otherwise, the
     C-PE node can make the local decision in choosing the least cost
     path, including the prior established MPLS paths and IPsec
     Tunnels, to forward the packet. Packets forwarded over the trusted
     MPLS VPN can be native without any additional encryption, while
     the packets sent over the untrusted networks need to be encrypted
     by IPsec SA.

     For a C-PE with multiple WAN ports provided by different ISPs,
     separate IPsec SAs can be established for the different WAN ports.
     In this case, the C-PE have multiple IPsec tunnels in addition to
     the MPLS path to choose from to forward the packets from the
     client ports.

     If the IPsec SA is chosen, the packet is encapsulated by the IPsec
     inner packet header and encrypted by the IPsec SA before
     forwarding to the WAN.

     For packets received from a MPLS path, processing is the same as
     MPLS VPN.

     For IPsec SA encrypted packets received from the WAN ports, the
     packets are decrypted, and the inner payload is decapsulated and

     forward per the forwarding table of the C-PE. For all packets from
     the Internet-facing WAN ports, the additional anti-DDoS mechanism
     has to be enabled to prevent potential attacks from the Internet-
     facing ports. Control Plane should not learn routes from the
     Internet-facing WAN ports.

   For multicast packets forwarding:

     For multicast traffic, MPLS multicast [RFC6513, RFC6514, or
     RFC7988] can be used to forward multicast traffic.

     If IPsec tunnels are chosen for a multicast packet, the packet is
     encapsulated and encrypted by multiple separate IPsec tunnels to
     the desired destinations.

6.3. Forwarding Model for PE based SDWAN

6.3.1. Network and Service Startup Procedures

   In this scenario, all PEs have secure interfaces facing the clients
   and facing the MPLS backbone, with some PEs having extra connections
   by untrusted public Internet. The public Internet paths are for
   offloading low priority traffic when the MPLS paths get congested.
   The PEs are already connected to their RRs, and the configurations
   for the clients and policies are already established.

6.3.2. Packet Walk-Through

   For PEs to offload some MPLS packets to the Internet path, each MPLS
   packet is wrapped by an outer IP header as MPLS-in-IP or MPLS-in-GRE


Dunbar, et al.         Expires October 20, 2021               [Page 23]

Internet-Draft            BGP Usage for SDWAN            April 23, 2021

   [RFC4023]. The outer IP address can be an interface address or the
   PE's loopback address.

   When IPsec Tunnel mode is used to protect an MPLS-in-IP packet, the
   entire MPLS-in-IP packet is placed after the IPsec tunnel header.

   When IPsec transport mode is used to protect the MPLS packet, the
   MPLS-in-IP packet's IP header becomes the outer IP header of the
   IPsec packet, followed by an IPsec header, and then followed by the
   MPLS label stack. The IPsec header must set the payload type to MPLS
   by using the IP protocol number specified in section 3 of RFC4023.

   If IPsec transport mode is applied to an MPLS-in-GRE packet, the GRE
   header follows the IPsec header.

   The IPsec SA's endpoints should not be the client-facing interface
   addresses unless the traffic to/from those clients always goes
   through the IPsec SA even when the MPLS backbone has enough capacity
   to transport the traffic.

   When the PEs' Internet-facing ports are behind the NAT [RFC3715], an
   outer UDP field can be added outside the encrypted payload
   [RFC3948]. Three UDP ports must be open on the PEs: UDP port 4500
   (used for NAT traversal), UDP port 500 (used for IKE), and IP
   protocol 50 (ESP). IPsec IKE (Internet Key Exchange) between the two
   PEs would be over the NAT [RFC3947] as well.

   Upon receiving a packet from a client port, the forwarding
   processing is the same as the MPLS VPN. If the MPLS backbone path to
   the destination is deemed congested, the IPsec tunnel towards the
   target PEs is used to encrypt the MPLS-in-IP packet.

   Upon receiving a packet from the Internet-facing WAN port, the
   packet is decrypted, and the inner MPLS payload is extracted to be
   sent to the MPLS VPN engine.

   Same as Scenario #2, the additional anti-DDoS mechanism must be
   enabled to prevent potential attacks from the Internet-facing port.
   Control Plane should not learn routes from the Internet-facing WAN
   ports.

7. Manageability Considerations

     BGP-controlled SDWAN utilizes the BGP RR to facilitate the routes
     and underlay properties distribution among the authorized edge
     nodes. With RR having the preconfigured policies about the

Internet-Draft            BGP Usage for SDWAN            April 23, 2021

     authorized peers, the peer-wise authentications of the IPsec IKE
     (Internet Key Exchange) are significantly simplified.

8. Security Considerations

   Adding an Internet-facing WAN port to a C-PE can introduce the
   following security risks:

   1) Potential DDoS attacks from the Internet-facing ports.

   2) Potential risk of provider VPN network being injected with
   illegal traffic from the Internet-facing WAN ports.

   Therefore, the additional anti-DDoS mechanism must be enabled on all
   Internet-facing ports to prevent potential attacks from those ports.
   Control Plane should not learn any routes from the Internet-facing
   WAN ports.

9. IANA Considerations

       No Action is needed.
