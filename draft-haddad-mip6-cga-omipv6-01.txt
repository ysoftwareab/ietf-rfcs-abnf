Abstract

   This memo suggests a new and enhanced route optimization  
   security mechanism, CGA-OMIPv6 (OMIPv6+), for Mobile IPv6
   (MIPv6). The primary motivations for OMIPv6+ are the reduction 
   of signaling load, handoff delay and enabling semi-long term 
   security associations.

1. Introduction
    
   This memo describes a method to incorporate the CGAs described
   in [CGA] and [Aura] in the OMIPv6 [OMIPv6] proposal. OMIPv6+ 
   suggests a new and enhanced route optimization (RO) security 
   mechanism for MIPv6 [MIPv6]. 
   The main goals for OMIPv6+, when compared to MIPv6 are a 
   substantial reduction of the signaling load, the handoff delay 
   times and enabling semi-long term security associations. 
   OMIPv6+ improves also the security in MIPv6 and the previously 
   defined OMIPv6 by closing the window of vulnerabilities in both 
   protocols.

   the Key option, the Key Nonce Index (KeNI) option, the Timestamp 
   (TiST) option and the BU Signature (BUS) option.      
   The draft defines also a new bit called the "Shared Secret" (S) 
   bit, which will be set by the MN in the BU message when it needs 
   the CN to create or refresh the shared secret.


4. Quick Overview of the CGA

   As described in [CGA] and [Aura], a Cryptographically Generated 
   Address (CGA) is an IPv6 address, which contains a set of bits 
   generated by hashing the IPv6 address owner's public key. Such 
   feature allows the user to provide a "proof of ownership" of its 
   IPv6 address. 
  
   The CGA offers three main advantages: it makes the spoofing 
   attack against the IPv6 address much harder and allows to sign 
   messages with the owner's private key. CGA does not require any
   upgrade or modification in the infrastructure.
  
   The CGA offers a method for binding a public key to an IPv6  
   address. The binding between the public key and the address can
   be verified by re-computing and comparing the hash value of the
   public key and other parameters sent in the specific message 
   with the interface identifier in the IPv6 address belonging to 
   the owner. Note that an attacker can always create its own CGA 
   address but he will not be able to spoof someone else's address 
   since he needs to sign the message with the corresponding 
   private key, which is supposed to be known only by the real 
   owner.    

   Each CGA is associated with a public key and auxiliary
   parameters. For OMIPv6, the public key MUST be formatted as a 
   DER-encoded [ITU.X690.2002] ASN.1 structure of the type 
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo defined in the Internet X.509 certificate 
   profile [PKIC].  
   The CGA verification takes as input an IPv6 address and 
   auxiliary parameters. These parameters are the following:

     - a 128-bit modifier, which can be any value,

     - a 64-bit subnet prefix, which is equal to the subnet prefix
       of the CGA,

     - an 8-bit collision count, which can have values 0, 1 and 2.

   If the verification succeeds, the verifier knows that the public
   key in the CGA parameters is the authentic public key of the 
   address owner. In order to sign a message, a node needs the CGA, 
   the associated CGA parameters, the message and the private

   cryptographic key that corresponds to the public key in the CGA
   parameters. The node needs to use a 128 bit type tag for the
   message from the CGA Message Type name space. The type tag is 
   an IANA-allocated 128 bit integer. 

   To sign a message, a node performs the following two steps:

     a) Concatenate the 128 bit type tag (in the network byte 
        order) and message with the type tag to the left and 
        message to the right. The concatenation is the message to 
        be signed in the next step. 
        
     b) Generate the RSA signature. The inputs to the generation 
        procedure are the private key and the concatenation 
        created in a).


5. Quick Overview of OMIPv6

   OMIPv6 [OMIPv6] describes a method to optimize the MIPv6 
   protocol by narrowing the window of vulnerability to the minimum 
   and eliminating most of the signaling messages associated to the 
   MIPv6 protocol. 

   The suggested optimization is a direct application of the  
   trade-off described in the Purpose-Built Key Framework [PBK]. 
   The OMIPv6 trade-off assumes that if a Return Routability (RR)
   procedure (e.g. the first one), defined in [MIPv6], is done 
   securely, then we can secure all the rest of the session and, 
   at the same time, eliminates the need for the HoTI/HoT/CoTI/CoT 
   messages in the ongoing session.  

   OMIPv6 uses the result of a specific RR procedure (i.e., the 
   Kbm) to sign the DH messages exchanged between the MN and the 
   CN. The DH procedure allows the two endpoints to compute a 
   strong shared secret and to use it to sign the BU/BA messages.


6. Description of CGA-OMIPv6 (OMIPv6+)

   The main goal of this proposal is to exploit the CGA features 
   in order to improve the security and the suggested optimization
   in the OMIPv6 proposal, which in turn is based on the MIPv6 
   protocol. For this purpose, this memo suggests dropping entirely 
   the RR procedure. 

   This proposal assumes that the MN has at least its IPv6 home 
   address based on CGA. Incorporating CGA in OMIPv6 consists on 
   using the first BU message sent by the MN on the direct path, to 
   ask the CN to create and return a shared secret, i.e., the Kbm.

   For this purpose, the MN MUST send in the first BU message a
   timestamp (defined in 7.3), set the "S" bit (defined in 7.5) and 
   sign the message with the private key corresponding to its key 
   pair in the CGA parameters (defined in 7.4). Note that the MN's 
   public key SHOULD be sent to the CN in an IPv6 destination 
   header option. 

   Rules for signing the BU message with the MN's private key are
   the following:

   Mobility Data = care-of address | correspondent | MH Data

   Signature = ENCRYPT( SHA1 (Mobility Data)))

   Where | denotes concatenation and "correspondent" is the CN's
   IPv6 address. Note that in case the CN is mobile, correspondent
   refers to the CN's home address.

   MH Data is the content of the mobility message without including 
   the MH header.

   The RSA signature is generated by using the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 
   [PKCS] signature algorithm with the SHA-1 hash algorithm. 
   
   Note that the CN MUST reject any BU message carrying a home 
   address (i.e., CGA) not included in its destination cache entry.
      
   Upon receiving the BU message, the CN MUST reply by sending a
   Binding Acknowledgment (BA) message, which MUST contain a Kbm 
   inserted in the Key option (defined in 7.1) and a Key Nonce  
   Index (KeNI) (defined in 7.2), which MUST be returned by the MN 
   in all subsequent BU messages. 
   The CN MUST use the new care-of address sent in the BU message 
   as the IPv6 destination address of the BA message. Note that the 
   CN will send the BA message ONLY after a successful verification 
   of the address owner's public key and the signature in the BU 
   message. The CN SHOULD use the timestamp sent in the BU message 
   to prevent against replay attacks using the first BU message. 

   The CN MUST authenticate the BA message with the Kbm and MUST 
   encrypt the Kbm field in the Key token option with the MN's 
   public key. Rules for authenticating the BA message are the
   following:

   Mobility Data = care-of address | correspondent | MH Data

   Authenticator = First (96, HMAC_SHA1 (Kbm, Mobility Data))
                   
   where | denotes concatenation and "correspondent" is the CN's
   IPv6 address.

INTERNET-DRAFT              Applying CGA to OMIPv6              May 2004



   "MH Data" is the content of the Mobility Header excluding the
   authenticator itself. The Authenticator value is calculated as
   if the Checksum field in the Mobility Header was zero.  
           
   Encrypting the Kbm is as per password encryption as defined in 
   [RAD], section 3.5. Note that the CN MUST encrypt the Kbm and
   then authenticate the MH data with the shared secret. 
                
   After receiving the BA message, the MN sets up a bidirectional 
   security association (SA) with the CN, and both nodes MUST use 
   ONLY the new Kbm to sign subsequent BU/BA messages. The two 
   endpoints MUST silently discard any signaling message sent 
   and/or received, to/from any of them and not signed with the Kbm
   and MUST use the sequence number in the BU/BA messages. The only 
   exception to this rule applies for the valid BU messages sent by 
   the MN and signed with its private key. 
     
   One key advantage offered by OMIPv6+ is the extension of the 
   lifetime of the BCE. Since, re-keying MAY be needed, OMIPv6+ 
   considers two scenarios: creating and refreshing the Kbm. In 
   order to create a new Kbm, the MN MUST send a BU message with a 
   higher timestamp, set the bit "S" and MUST sign the message with 
   its private key. Such scenario occurs at the beginning of the 
   session and when, for some reason, the MN reboots during an 
   ongoing session. 
   In order to refresh the Kbm, i.e., the bidirectional SA expires 
   during the ongoing session, the MN MUST send a BU message with 
   the bit "S" set, a valid sequence number, the KeNI and MUST sign 
   the message with its private key. When the CN receives a Kbm 
   refresh request in a valid BU message, it MUST send a new shared 
   secret in a BA message, and SHOULD authenticate the BA message 
   with the previous Kbm. 
    
   Note that the CN MUST perform a care-of address test each time
   it receives a BU message, which carries an alternate care-of 
   address different from the BU source address and from the MN's 
   home address. The care-of address test can be done by either
   using the standard return routability procedure or some
   alternative scheme, which may have better characteristics, e.g.,
   using a signaling extension described in [MIPsec] or the 
   Credit-Based Long-Term Address Tests [CBA].

7. New Options Format 

7.1 The Key Option Format

   As it has been mentioned above, the CN MUST send a new Kbm each 
   time it receives a BU message signed with the MN's private key 
   and with the (S) bit set. For this purpose, this proposal uses 
   a new option called Key option, which MUST be inserted in the 
   BA message.    
 
   The format of the new option is as follows:


   0                   1                   2                   3

7.2 The Key Nonce Index (KeNI) Option Format

   The CN MUST insert this option in the BA message sent to the MN 
   after receiving a BU message signed with the MN's corresponding 
   private key and with the bit (S) set. 

   The KeNI option format is as follows:


   0                   1                   2                   3

7.3 The Timestamp (TiST) Option Format

   The MN MUST use the timestamp (TiST) in any BU message sent to
   the CN and carrying a request to create a new shared secret 
   (i.e., the BU message is signed with the MN's private key and 
   has the "S" bit set). 
   
   The TiST option format is as follows:


   0                   1                   2                   3

   Option Length

       Length of the option = 16  

   Option Data

       Timestamps are represented as a 64-bit unsigned fixed point
       number, in seconds relative to January 1, 1970 00:00 UTC. 
       In this format the integer number of seconds is contained in 
       the first 32 bits of the field, and the remaining 32 bits 
       indicate the fraction part. The non-significant low order 
       bits in the fraction part of the timestamp MUST be filled 
       with zero and a random, unbiased 64-bitstring, will be added 
       both to avoid systematic roundoff errors and as a means of 
       loop detection and replay detection.

7.4 The BU Signature (BUS) Option

   When the MN signs the BU message with its CGA private key, it
   MUST insert the signature in the BUS option. Such scenario 
   occurs when the MN sends its first BU message to the CN and if
   the MN reboots during an ongoing session. 
      
   The BUS option format is as follows:


   0                   1                   2                   3

7.5 The Shared Secret (S) bit

   As it has been mentioned, a new bit is defined in the binding
   update message. This bit, called the shared secret (S) bit, 
   MUST be set by the MN ONLY when it needs to ask the CN to 
   create/refresh the Kbm. In both cases, setting the "S" bit will 
   trigger the CN to reply to the BU message with a BA message 
   carrying a new Kbm shared secret.

8. IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new CGA Message Type name space for 
   use as type tags in messages that may be signed using CGA 
   signatures. The values in this name space are 128-bit unsigned 
   integers. Values in this name space are allocated on a First 
   Come First Served basis [IANA]. IANA assigns new 128-bit values 
   directly without a review.

   CGA Message Type values for private use MAY be generated with a
   strong random-number generator without IANA allocation.

   This document defines a new 128-bit value under the CGA Message
   Type [CGA] namespace, 0x5F27 0586 8D6C 4C56 A246 9EBB 9B2A 2E13. 

   This document defines four new mobility options, which must be 
   assigned Option Type values within the option numbering space of
   [MIPv6].

9. Security Considerations

   This draft describes a method to exploit the CGA features in 
   order to authenticate the BU message. In fact, the CGA replaces
   the authentication by providing a proof of ownership while the 
   RR procedure replaces the authentication by a routing property. 
   However, it should be mentioned that while the CGA can provide
   a protection against unauthenticated BUs, it can expose the
   involved nodes to DoS attacks since it is computationally 
   expensive. The draft limits the use of CGA to only the first BU 
   and if/when re-keying is needed.
