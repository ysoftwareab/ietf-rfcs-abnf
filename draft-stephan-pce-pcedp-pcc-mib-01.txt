1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects used for managing Path
   Computation Elements Discovery Protocol (PCEDP) inside a Path
   Computation Client (PCC) application.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].


3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL", when they appear in this document, are to be interpreted
   as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document is built on notions introduced
   and discussed in PCE WG documents.  The reader should be familiar
   with these documents.

   Domain:
      any collection of network elements within a common sphere of
      address management or path computational responsibility.

   IGP Area:
      OSPF Area or ISIS level.

   PCC:

      Path Computation Client: any client application requesting a path
      computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element.

   PCE:
      Path Computation Element: an entity (component, application, or
      network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route
      based on a network graph, and applying computational constraints.


5.  Overview

   [I-D.ietf-pce-architecture], describes the architecture for a PCE-
   based path computation model for MPLS and GMPLS TE LSPs.  The
   architecture allows the separation of PCE from PCC.  It requires that
   a PCC be aware of the location of one or more PCEs.  This relies on a
   communication protocol between PCC and PCE for automatic and dynamic
   PCE discovery.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-discovery-reqs] defines the mechanism and the
   information of PCE discovery.  [I-D.ietf-pce-disco-proto-igp]
   declines theses components for PCCs participating to an IGP routing
   domain:
   o  The discovery mechanism relies on IGP (OSPF, ISIS) routing
      protocol;
   o  It defines the information elements a PCE participating in the IGP
      advertises in IGP extensions.

   The section "6.10.2.1.  PCC MIB module " of [I-D.ietf-pce-discovery-
   reqs] identifies the information to be disclosed on the management
   interface of the PCC.  The current MIB module defines the
   corresponding objects.


6.  Structure of the MIB Module

   Objects in this MIB module are arranged into groups.  Each group is
   organized as a set of related objects.  The overall structure and
   assignment of objects to their groups, and the intended purpose of
   each group, is shown below.

6.1.  Textual Conventions

6.1.1.  PccPceDpRoutingDomainID

   A PCE-DOMAINS information element or a A PCE-DEST-DOMAINS information
   element carries the identifier of a routing domain (area,as) which
   type and size depend on both the routing protocol and on the version
   of Internet protocol in use in this routing domain.

Internet-Draft                PCC PCEDP MIB                    June 2006


   The Textual Convention PccPceDpRoutingDomainID defines a common SMI
   type for these different kinds of routing domain identifiers.

   These TCs are used for defining PCE-DOMAINS and PCE-DEST-DOMAINS
   objects.

6.2.  The Discovery objects

   These objects provide PCE discovery information and discovery
   activities.

   It includes:
      - A control to disable the automatic discovery mechanism;
      - The number of known PCEs;
      - The number of discovered PCEs;
      - The set of known PCEs.

         pccPcedpDiscPceTable gives discovery information per PCE:
            - Addresses, discovery Mechanism type;
            - Discovery time, last activity time
      pccPcedpDiscActTable gives discovery activity per PCE:
      *  congestion
      *  discovery protocol activity: these objects will define the
         average and maximum rates of arrival, departure and
         modification of PCE discovery to enable effective analysis of
         the operation of the protocols.
      *  these objects will report on the operation of the discovery
         protocol by counting the number of unacceptable and
         incomprehensible information exchanges.

6.3.  General PCEs capabilities objects

   These objects provides general information per PCE regarding PCE-
   PATHSCOPE, PCE-DOMAINS and PCE-DEST-DOMAINS

   CapPathScopeTable defines PCE computation capabilities and PCE
   preferences per kind of routing domain.

   CapDomainTable defines domains for which a PCE has topology
   visibility and can compute paths.

   CapDestDomainTable defines domains toward which a PCE can compute
   path

6.4.  The Notification Group

   This group will define notifications when thresholds (e.g. on the
   maximum rate of change, on the number of unacceptable messages) are

   crossed, or when important events occur (e.g. the number of
   discovered PCEs decreases to zero).


7.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

7.1.  Relationship to  IGP MIB modules

   PCEDP relies on existing protocols which have specialized MIB objects
   to monitor protocol activities.  Consequently this document considers
   that the monitoring of the undelying protocol in out of the scope of
   the current MIB module.

7.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB [RFC2863] and
   also REFERENCEs document RFC0768 [RFC0768]

         "A PCE-DOMAINS information element or a A PCE-DEST-DOMAINS
         information element carries the identifier of a routing domain
         (area,as) which type depends on both the routing protocol and
         on the version of Internet protocol in use in this routing
         domain.

         This TC defines a common SMI type for the different kinds of
         routing domain identifiers.

         An PccPceDpRoutingDomainID value is always interpreted within
         the context of an AddressFamilyNumbers value.  Every usage of
         the PccPceDpRoutingDomainID textual convention is required to
         specify the AddressFamilyNumbers object which provides the
         context.

         The value of an PccPceDpRoutingDomainID object must always be
         consistent with the value of the associated
         AddressFamilyNumbers object.

         Following is the mapping between AddressFamilyNumbers type and
         PccPceDpRoutingDomainID size:
            ipV4(1):
               PccPceDpRoutingDomainID is an InetAddressIPv4
               corresponding to the name of an OSPF area;
            ipV6(2):
               PccPceDpRoutingDomainID is an InetAddressIPv6
               corresponding to the name of an OSPF area;

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
   o  on/off of discovery : Unauthorized changes to
      pccPcedpDiscAdminStatus could result in a temporary interruption
      of the discovery ;

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to



Stephan                 Expires December 27, 2006              [Page 19]

Internet-Draft                PCC PCEDP MIB                    June 2006


   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
   o  IP addresses of PCE.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   document hits the IESG.


Appendix B.  Editing MIB module in XML

   This section must be removed before this document hits the IESG.

   This section is not related to PCE WG.  It focuses on MIB document
   editing, and XML editing of MIB module using xxe pluging and xml2rfc.

   Prior to the edition of the document the author initiated a
   discussion with the Rfc-editor regarding the way to write SMI
   definition in XML.  This discussion has 2 results:
   1.  This document use some material from "MIB Module Document Text
       Template" [I-D.harrington-text-mib-doc-template].;
   2.  Regarding xml2rfc usage, currently MIB modules are writen in raw
       text encapsulated in XML <figure> and <artwork> tokens.  So the
       editor must take care of all formating aspecs such as the length
       of each line, bullet tabulation...  This is against the spirit of
       xml2rfc and of XML.  So I writen this MIB module using XML <list>
       tokens to let xml2rfc deals with the formating of the document.
       The results are excellent:
       1.  The text version of this MIB module does not differ from a
           mib module handcrafted;
       2.  smilint does not detect any difference;
       3.  The editong with xxe is user friendly;
   3.  Conclusion:
       1.  Writing MIB module in XML is the right direction.
       2.  MIB module editing will be very fast if we define a set of
           XML templates for SMI objects definition.  These definitions
           should be added to"MIB Module Document Template"
           [I-D.harrington-xml2rfc-mib-doc-template].

   Following are some comments related to "MIB Module Document Text
   Template" [I-D.harrington-text-mib-doc-template] :
   1.  It should help to determine which SNMP and SMI rfc are normative
       or informative.
