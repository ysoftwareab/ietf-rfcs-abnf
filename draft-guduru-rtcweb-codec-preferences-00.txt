                        WebRTC Codec Preferences
                draft-guduru-rtcweb-codec-preferences-00

Abstract

   WebRTC working group prefers mandatory to implement codecs inside the
   browser to achieve guaranteed interoperability between two WebRTC
   peers.  WebRTC allows browser implementors to support vendor specific
   codecs apart from mandatory codecs.  This document explains the way
   to give preferences for media codecs in WebRTC context out of the
   available codecs in browser for creating the offer / answer.

1.  Introduction

   WebRTC specified mandatory to implement codecs for attaining the
   interoperability between browsers and to increase the success rate
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-audio].  Browser implementors may support other
   codecs apart from mandatory to implement codecs.  This specification
   describes a mechanism for JavaScript application to check the
   available codecs, to give preferences among the available codecs and
   to remove some codecs if the application don't want to use them.
   This specification extends RTCPeerConnection by adding two new
   methods, getSupportedAudioCodecs and getSupportedVideoCodecs and the
   offer / answer options with sequences of audio and video codec list.
   This process will avoid the SDP mangling for removing and re-ordering
   of codecs.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  getSupportedAudioCodecs

   The getSupportedAudioCodes method of RTCPeerConnection returns the
   supported audio codecs.  This function SHOULD be called before
   calling createOffer or createAnswer mehtod.

4.  getSupportedVideoCodecs

   The getSupportedVideoCodes method of RTCPeerConnection returns the
   supported video codecs.  This function SHOULD be called before
   calling createOffer or createAnswer mehtod.

5.  RTCOfferAnswerOptions

   createOffer and createAnswer methods supports optional "options"
   attribute.  A sequence of audio and video codecs, namely
   preferedAudioCodecs and preferedVideoCodecs respectively, in
   applications prefered order SHOULD be included as optional
   constraints in RTCOfferAnswerOptions.  Next sections explain about
   preferedAudioCodecs and preferdVideoCodecs.

5.1.  preferedAudioCodecs

   preferedAudioCodecs optional constraint is a sequence of audio codecs
   in the applications prefered order.  If the application does not
   specify any codec preference, then this attribute MUST not be added
   to RTCOfferAnswerOptions.  If options attribute is not present in the
   createOffer/createAnswer, browser SHOULD arrange the codecs with
   previously specified preference, if specified earlier for that
   session, otherwise browser MAY arrange the codecs with its own
   preferences.  The prefered codec sequence MAY contain the same number
   of audio codecs returned by getSupportedAudioCodecs.  Audio codecs
   other than those supported by browser SHOULD be ignored, if present
   in preferedAudioCodecs.  If the preferedAudioCodecs does not contain
   atleast one audio codec returned by getAudioCodecs, browser SHOULD
   fire an error event UNSUPPORTED_CODECS.  The offer/answer SHOULD_NOT
   contain audo codecs other than those specified in preferedAudioCodecs
   and the order of preference SHOULD be with high priority for the
   codecs first in the preferedAudioCodecs sequence.

5.2.  preferedVideoCodecs

   preferedVideoCodecs optional constraint is a sequence of video codecs
   in the applications prefered order.  If the application does not
   specify any codec preference, then this attribute MUST not be added
   to RTCOfferAnswerOptions.  If options attribute is not present in the
   createOffer/createAnswer, browser SHOULD arrange the codecs with
   previously specified preference, if specified earlier for that
   session, otherwise browser MAY arrange the codecs with its own
   preferences.  The prefered codec sequence MAY contain the same number
   of video codecs returned by getSupportedVideoCodecs.  Video codecs
   other than those supported by browser SHOULD be ignored, if present
   in preferedVideoCodecs.  If the preferedVideoCodecs does not contain
   atleast one video codec returned by getVideoCodecs, browser SHOULD

   fire an error event UNSUPPORTED_CODECS.  The offer/answer SHOULD_NOT
   contain audo codecs other than those specified by preferedVideoCodecs
   and the order of preference SHOULD be with high priority for the
   codecs first in the preferedVideoCodecs sequence.
