Internet-Draft    WLAN Switch Benchmarking Terminology      January 2008


1.  Introduction

   Wireless LANs (WLANs) are deployed on a large scale in traditional
   enterprises, in commercial service offerings such as coffee shops, as
   well as vertical applications such as inventory management.  These
   deployments initially used a distributed network of Access Points
   (APs).  Large WLAN deployments using distributed APs, however,
   introduce several issues.  These include: an increased administrative
   burden, as the APs are individually IP-addressable; the need to
   ensure consistency of configuration across all APs; the difficulty of
   dealing with the dynamic nature of the WLAN medium and combating RF
   interference and noise; assuring seamless mobility for end users
   across the WLAN; and the more complex task of securing the WLAN
   against intrusion or unauthorized access.

   To address the above problems, vendors offer solutions that combine
   aspects of LAN switching, centralized control, and distributed
   wireless access in an architecture comprising a set of relatively
   simple Wireless termination points (WTPs) coupled to one or more
   Access controllers (ACs).  The use of centralized control and
   monitoring simplifies many of the management and security issues
   noted above, as the WTPs can be configured and controlled as a group
   by the ACs, security policies can be administered on a WLAN-wide
   basis, and the RF domain can be monitored and controlled from a
   central location.

   Each vendor offering such a system needs a protocol between ACs and
   WTPs to support both centralized management and data transport
   functions.  The general practice has been for vendors to use a
   proprietary protocol; however, the CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning
   of Wireless Access Points) protocol is being standardized by the IETF
   to provide a multi-vendor interoperable interface between WTPs and
   ACs.  The CAPWAP protocol also defines a standardized WLAN
   architecture and mandatory functions (such as discovery) to enable a
   common functional model to be adopted across the vendor base.

   The ACs may perform both control plane and data plane functions
   within a WLAN.  It is therefore of significant interest to benchmark
   their performance, as they have a material impact on the performance
   and perceived end-user experience of WLANs built around them.  ACs
   may be benchmarked either as stand-alone entities, or in conjunction
   with the WTPs to which they connect.  When ACs are benchmarked in
   conjunction with WTPs, the CAPWAP architectural model is used as a
   reference.

   This document defines the terminology to be used by vendors and users
   of switched WLAN devices when measuring and reporting performance
   characteristics of such devices.  It extends existing terminology

   defined in RFC 2544 [RFC2544] and subsequently extended in RFC 2285
   [RFC2285].  Terms generally applicable to WLAN switching systems are
   defined first, followed by specific terminology relating to data
   plane and control plane metrics.


2.  Existing definitions and requirements

   RFC 1242, "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect Devices"
   [RFC1242] and RFC 2285, "Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching
   Devices" [RFC2285] SHOULD be reviewed in conjunction with this
   document.  WLAN-specific terms and definitions are also provided in
   Clauses 3 and 4 of the IEEE 802.11 standard [802.11].  Commonly used
   terms may also be found in RFC 1983 [RFC1983].

   For the sake of clarity and continuity, this document adopts the
   general template for benchmarking terminology set out in Section 2 of
   RFC 1242.  Definitions are organized in alphabetical order, and
   grouped into sections for ease of reference.

   The following terms are assumed to be taken as defined in RFC 1242
   [RFC1242]: Throughput, Latency, Constant Load, Frame Loss Rate, and
   Overhead Behavior.  In addition, the following terms are taken as
   defined in RFC 2285 [RFC2285]: Forwarding Rates, Maximum Forwarding
   Rate, Loads, Device Under Test (DUT), and System Under Test (SUT).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Definitions of terms

   The terminology defined in this document is divided into three main
   categories: general WLAN definitions, WLAN data plane definitions,
   and WLAN control plane definitions.

   General WLAN definitions relate to the main physical and logical
   components of the WLAN architecture as defined by CAPWAP.  These
   definitions are not specific to any particular metric or test
   procedure.

   WLAN data plane definitions relate to data frame forwarding functions
   within the WLAN architecture.

   WLAN control plane definitions are associated with functions, metrics
   and test procedures that are connected with the management and
   control of system components.  These control plane functions are

   usually unrelated to traffic forwarding, and handled by software on
   the AC and WTP.

3.1.  General terms

3.1.1.  Wireless LAN (WLAN)

   Definition:

       A radio-based local area network architecture.

   Discussion:

       A WLAN performs the same functions as a typical (Ethernet) LAN,
       but utilizes digital radio links rather than copper or optical
       fiber connections.  The principal benefits of a WLAN are mobility
       and reduced physical plant (i.e., cabling).

       The most common WLAN protocol today is IEEE 802.11 [802.11],
       which comprises: various radio PHY technologies; a Carrier Sense
       Multiple Access / Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) shared-medium
       access method; encryption and authentication for security;
       prioritized medium access for QoS; and functions for discovery,
       connection establishment and mobility (roaming).

3.1.2.  Access controller (AC)

   Definition:

Internet-Draft    WLAN Switch Benchmarking Terminology      January 2008


       A network infrastructure device that provides centralized
       control, management and frame switching functions for a WLAN.

   Discussion:

       An AC is a component of a centralized WLAN architecture as
       defined by CAPWAP.  The AC provides connectivity and control for
       Wireless Termination Points (WTPs), switches frames between the
       wireless and wired portions of the LAN infrastructure, and
       supports discovery, initialization, configuration, management and
       data transfer functions.

       N/A

   See Also:

       Wireless termination point (WTP)

       Wireless LAN (WLAN)

3.1.3.  Endstation (STA)

   Definition:

       A user or subscriber device within a WLAN, that connects to a WTP
       and sources or sinks data traffic.

   Discussion:

       Endstations in a WLAN are equivalent to hosts in a traditional
       (wired) LAN, but are more diverse and functional entities.  They
       are also frequently referred to as clients.  Endstations comprise
       normal host devices such as laptops; peripherals such as
       printers; mobile devices such as phones; consumer electronics
       devices such as TVs; and even industrial or medical devices such
       as RFID tags and heart monitors.

       Endstations in a WLAN are connection-oriented, and must connect
       to the WLAN and authenticate with it before exchanging data
       traffic.

       N/A

   See Also:

       Access controller (AC)

       Wireless termination point (WTP)

3.1.4.  Wireless termination point (WTP)

   Definition:

       A bridge between the wireless (RF) and wired domains, that acts
       in conjunction with an AC to provide services to endstations.

   Discussion:

       WTPs (also referred to as Access Points, or APs) are a component
       of the CAPWAP architecture.  They implement all of the PHY layer
       functions as well as some subset of the link layer functions of
       the IEEE 802.11 protocol.  In a CAPWAP system, the WTPs serve as
       an encapsulating bridge between the RF domain in which the
       endstations exist and the wired Ethernet LAN where the ACs
       reside.  Depending on the specific implementation, WTPs may also
       provide some of the discovery, security and mobility functions
       required by endstations.

       Each WTP typically serves several endstations.  The WTP and its
       associated endstations contend for and share the RF medium among
       themselves.  WTPs may contain multiple radios (and MAC
       functionality) to provide service on more than one WLAN frequency
       band at the same time.  WTPs may also advertise several Service
       set identifiers (SSIDs) on the same frequency band in order to
       support multiple logical WLANs that provide different types of
       service (e.g., voice and data) simultaneously.

3.1.5.  Service set identifier (SSID)

   Definition:

       Tag assigned to a specific logical WLAN.

   Discussion:

       WLAN administrators may elect to overlay multiple logical WLANs
       on a single physical topology, in the same manner as virtual LANs
       (VLANs) are used in Ethernet LANs.  Each logical WLAN is given an
       identifying tag, referred to as an SSID, and is a sequence of up
       to 32 ASCII characters.  SSIDs supported by a WLAN are frequently
       advertised in protocol frames such as beacons and probe
       responses, so that endstations may discover the available list of
       logical WLANs and attempt to associate with one of them.

       The logical WLAN identified by an SSID has a distinct set of
       properties shared among all its entities, such as security type
       (encryption as well as authentication), QoS mechanisms, access
       rights (e.g., guest or intranet user), and even services offered
       (e.g., voice or data).

3.1.6.  Rogue device

   Definition:

       An unauthorized device, either an endstation or a WTP, that is
       introduced into a WLAN.

Internet-Draft    WLAN Switch Benchmarking Terminology      January 2008


   Discussion:

       As WLANs require no physical cabling between WTPs and
       endstations, it is relatively simple for users or intruders to
       introduce a new endstation - or, less commonly, a new WTP -
       without the consent or knowledge of the network administrator(s).
       Such rogue devices are high security risks.  When introduced by
       legitimate users, they fall outside security policies set up by
       the network administrators; when set up by intruders, they
       represent security breaches or denial of service attacks.

       Detection and isolation or containment of rogue devices is a
       usual function in most enterprise WLANs.

       Unprovisioned WTP

3.1.7.  Provisioned WTP

   Definition:

       WTPs that have been successfully registered with an AC.

   Discussion:

       As part of rogue WTP detection and containment procedures, a WTP
       is usually required to be authenticated and registered by an AC
       before it is allowed to associate endstations or transfer data
       traffic.  In many cases, encrypted tunnels between the WTP and AC
       must be configured and firmware versions verified (or downloaded)
       as well.  A provisioned WTP is therefore one that has
       successfully completed all these steps and appears in the AC
       database as a legitimate WTP.

Internet-Draft    WLAN Switch Benchmarking Terminology      January 2008


       Note that in some cases a WTP that has been previously
       authenticated and registered by an AC will take less time to be
       provisioned on subsequent registration attempts, because of
       caching of WTP information by the AC.

       Unprovisioned WTP

3.1.8.  Unprovisioned WTP

   Definition:

       A WTP that has not (yet) been successfully registered with an AC.

   Discussion:

       Unprovisioned WTPs are devices in the process of registering with
       an AC, but have not yet completed the registration process and
       are not yet treated as rogue WTPs.  If an unprovisioned WTP
       completes the registration process successfully, it becomes a
       provisioned WTP; if it fails, it becomes a rogue WTP.  An
       unprovisioned WTP is not normally capable of transferring data or
       associating endstations.

       single intended destination.

       For the purposes of this document, a unicast traffic flow has two
       attributes: it carries user or application data, and it has
       unicast destination addresses at both the link layer and the IP
       layer.  (If the traffic frames are encapsulated, then these
       attributes pertain to the encapsulated traffic frames and not the
       outer headers.)  A well-formed unicast traffic flow also
       possesses unicast source addresses at both the link and IP
       layers.

       "User or application data" in this context refers to traffic that
       is not connected with control or management functions specific to
       the WLAN itself.

       A unicast traffic flow is also expected to carry traffic for a
       single data stream, with reference to the protocol layer of
       interest.  For example, if the internetwork layer is of interest,
       then a unicast traffic flow SHOULD carry packets from a single IP
       address to a single IP address.  If the application layer is
       being considered, then the unicast traffic flow SHOULD be
       generated by a single application entity, and SHOULD NOT contain
       packets multiplexed from several application entities or
       protocols.

       A stream of one or more data frames from a single source to more
       than one intended destination.

   Discussion:

       For the purposes of this document, a multicast traffic flow has
       two attributes: it carries user or application data, and it has
       multicast destination addresses at both the link layer and the IP
       layer.  (If the traffic frames are encapsulated, then these
       attributes pertain to the encapsulated traffic frames and not the
       outer headers.)  A well-formed multicast traffic flow also
       possesses unicast source addresses at both the link and IP
       layers.

       "User or application data" in this context refers to traffic that
       is not connected with control or management functions specific to
       the WLAN itself.

       While it is possible for multicast traffic flows to be originated
       from different source entities, a given multicast traffic flow
       SHOULD be associated with a single application.

3.1.11.  Best-effort traffic

   Definition:

       A unicast or multicast traffic flow that is not associated with
       any service guarantees, such as maximum loss, maximum latency, or
       maximum jitter.

   Discussion:

       This type of traffic is assigned the lowest priority in the QoS
       hierarchy.  It is often used as the "default" traffic priority,
       and is typically used by applications that are not adversely
       affected by loss or delay.  For example, a file transfer carried
       out over TCP can recover from network losses, and retains high
       transfer rates even over high-delay links.

   Definition:

       A unicast or multicast traffic flow that is required to adhere to
       one or more service guarantees, such as maximum loss, maximum
       latency, or maximum jitter.

   Discussion:

       High-priority traffic is generated and consumed by applications
       that cannot tolerate loss, delay (or delay variation), or both.
       An example is a voice connection (Voice over IP, or VoIP); voice
       data streams must be delivered by the infrastructure with low
       delay and jitter, and with low packet loss, to avoid significant
       degradation of voice quality.

       High-priority traffic is usually marked by a QoS tag (e.g., a
       DSCP codepoint, an 802.11e Access Category value [802.11e], or an
       802.1D user_priority field) that indicates the desired level of
       service guarantees required.  In some connection-oriented
       networks, the marking may be implicit (i.e., assigned to the
       connection at setup time).

       To enable the service guarantees of different types of traffic to
       be met, a hierarchy of QoS tags or markings is usually
       established within the network infrastructure.  Concurrently
       received traffic bearing different QoS tags are provided
       different levels of service.

3.1.13.  Roaming

   Definition:

       The process whereby a WLAN endstation moves from the coverage
       area of one WTP to the coverage area of another.

   Discussion:

       IEEE 802.11 is a connection-oriented protocol where the
       endstations (clients) associate, or connect, to a single WTP at a
       time; typically, the closest WTP to the endstation.  When an
       endstation moves from the neighborhood of one WTP to the
       neighborhood of another, it attempts to maintain the best
       possible wireless link parameters (signal strength and bit error
       ratio) by disassociating from the former and associating with the
       latter.  At this point, the endstation is said to have roamed
       from one WTP to another, and a roaming event is said to have
       taken place.

       The exact sequence of events during roaming varies considerably,
       based on security mode and other factors.  However, the general
       process is as follows:



       *   the endstation makes a roaming decision based on some
           internal criteria, such as link quality or traffic load

       *   the endstation determines the new WTP with which it should
           associate or reassociate

       *   the endstation passively or actively disassociates with the
           current WTP, thereby interrupting data transfer

       *   the endstation performs a (re)association process with the
           new WTP

       *   data transfer resumes (i.e., the new WTP begins transferring
           data to the endstation)

       Roaming MUST be applied only to movements of endstations within
       the same logical or physical wireless network; for example, the
       SSID MUST remain constant, and the security parameters MUST NOT
       change.  The endstation IP address SHOULD NOT change, which
       usually confines roaming to a single subnet; however, if the WTPs
       or AC can proxy for the endstation on different subnet, then
       roaming can occur across subnets.  Endstations that use DHCP MAY
       elect to renew the DHCP lease after each roaming event.

       Note that "roaming" in the WLAN context corresponds to "handover"
       or "handoff" in the cellular wireless context.

3.1.14.  Inter-AC roaming

   Definition:

       A roaming situation wherein a WLAN endstation moves between WTPs
       connected to different ACs.

   Discussion:

       An enterprise WLAN may comprise multiple ACs, each associated
       with a separate subset of WTPs, but acting in concert to present
       the appearance of a single integrated network to the endstations.
       In this case, it is possible for endstations to roam between WTPs
       belonging to different ACs, requiring the ACs to perform a
       handoff between themselves to maintain connectivity to the
       endstation.

       This type of handoff is usually more complex than the simple case
       where the endstation roams only between WTPs associated with a
       single AC.  It involves rapidly transferring security and

       connection state information from one AC to another, in addition
       to the usual requirements of reprovisioning WTPs and
       reassociating the endstation.  Inter-AC roaming can therefore
       incur higher roaming delays.

   Discussion:

       This is the simplest case of roaming in a WLAN employing WTPs and
       ACs: the endstations roam between different WTPs, but each
       endstation only roams within the subset of WTPs that are
       associated with a single AC.  In this situation there is no need
       for ACs to transfer state information between themselves, and as
       a consequence roaming delays may be lower.

3.1.16.  Roaming decision

   Definition:

       The point in time at which a WLAN endstation decides to initiate
       a roaming process.

   Discussion:

       An endstation typically monitors the quality of the link between
       itself and the WTP to which it is currently associated, and will
       also monitor the neighboring WTPs whose signals it can receive.
       (Some endstations may also monitor the traffic load of their
       partner WTP as well.)  When these factors cross predefined
       thresholds, and a "better" neighboring WTP is available, the
       endstation will make a decision to roam to the "better" WTP.
       This is referred to as the roaming decision, and is a basic part
       of the mobility process.

       Once the roaming decision has been made, data traffic is usually
       interrupted, because the endstation will disassociate (passively
       or actively) from the current WTP and initiate the process of
       roaming to a new WTP.  Data traffic in either upstream or
       downstream directions will not resume until the endstation has
       successfully roamed.

3.1.17.  Roam failure

   Definition:

       Failure to successfully complete the roaming process and restore
       data service.

   Discussion:

       The roaming (mobility) process is complex and can involve several
       layers of handshakes, especially when security protocols are
       involved.  If one or more of these handshakes fails completely
       (i.e., the retries thereof all fail), then roaming will not
       complete and data service to the roaming endstation will not be
       restored by the WLAN infrastructure.  Further, it is also
       possible for the association handshakes during roaming to
       complete successfully but for data service to not be restored
       (i.e., downstream data transfer does not resume).  The occurrence
       of either of these events is classified as a roaming failure.

       The consequences of a roaming failure are usually catastrophic
       for user applications that are engaged in transferring data while
       roaming is taking place.

   Definition:

Internet-Draft    WLAN Switch Benchmarking Terminology      January 2008


       To permit efficient discovery and self-configuration by
       endstations, WTPs periodically broadcast IEEE 802.11 control
       frames referred to as beacons.  Beacons contain information
       relating to a logical WLAN, such as acceptable PHY data rates,
       security information, QoS information, and so on.  The configured
       time interval from the start of one beacon to the start of the
       next beacon is referred to as the beacon period.

       Note that beacons must obey the rules of the CSMA/CA access
       protocol as well.  Hence the actual time interval between beacons
       may not equal the configured time interval.  However, the error
       is not accumulative, and so over a statistically significant
       period of time the average interval between beacons will be very
       close to the nominal beacon period.

       The default beacon period of IEEE 802.11 WTPs is 102.4 msec.

3.1.19.  Listen interval

   Definition:

       The time interval at which an endstation in sleep mode wakes to
       check for buffered traffic.

   Discussion:

       WLAN endstations are frequently battery-powered, mobile devices
       that need to conserve power consumption (and increase battery
       life) by sleeping when they have no data to send, after first
       notifying the WTP/AC.  WTPs and/or ACs are expected to buffer
       downstream data traffic for sleeping endstations until the
       endstation wakes up and polls for buffered data, which is done
       periodically.

       The interval between polls for buffered data is known as the
       listen interval.  The size of the listen interval is usually

Internet-Draft    WLAN Switch Benchmarking Terminology      January 2008


       configurable, in order to strike a balance between battery life
       and traffic delays.  A larger listen interval results in reduced
       power consumption, as the endstation has to wake up less often,
       but also increases the delays in downstream traffic.

       As the polling operation is linked to trigger fields in the
       beacons emitted by the WTP, the listen interval is defined to be
       an integral number of beacon periods.  The default listen
       interval for normal IEEE 802.11 endstations is usually 3 beacon
       periods.

3.1.20.  Preauthentication

   Definition:

       The process of authenticating with a target WTP prior to
       performing a roam to that WTP.

   Discussion:

       Endstations normally need to perform a complete security
       handshake (e.g., IEEE 802.11 authentication and association, EAP/
       TLS authentication, and key exchange) when they re-associate with
       a new WTP during a roaming event.  This is because WLAN security
       mechanisms produce different keys on different WTPs, as the WTP
       MAC address and other information forms part of the key
       derivation mechanism.  This can greatly extend the time required
       to complete a roaming event, because EAP handshakes are usually
       long and complex.

       To reduce the roaming time, the IEEE 802.11 standard permits a
       shortcut to be implemented by endstations: prior to the actual
       roam, the endstation may complete an authentication with the
       target WTP via the WTP with which the endstation is currently
       associated.  Essentially the authentication frames are received
       over the wireless medium by the current WTP and then tunneled

Internet-Draft    WLAN Switch Benchmarking Terminology      January 2008


       over the wired infrastructure to the target WTP.

       When the roam event actually occurs, the endstation can bypass
       the entire EAP authentication process and skip directly to IEEE
       802.1X key derivation, using the parameters (such as keying
       material) that have already been negotiated.  This is known as
       preauthentication.

   Definition:

       The process of retaining (caching) security contexts when roaming
       between WTPs, and using the cached contexts to reduce roaming
       delay.

   Discussion:

       As described in section 3.1.14 (Preauthentication), endstations
       must normally perform a complete security handshake during a
       roaming event, which can significantly drive up roaming delay.
       PMKID caching is a means of reducing roaming delay in the event
       that an endstation returns to a WTP after roaming away from it.

       Normally the endstation discards the security context when
       disassociating from a WTP.  When PMKID caching is in effect,
       however, the endstation retains the security context and, if it
       attempts to re-associate with the same WTP, signals the WTP that
       the security context from the previous association is still
       available.  The WTP may then bypass the entire EAP authentication
       process and skip directly to IEEE 802.1X key derivation.

3.1.22.  QoS differentiation

   Definition:

       Differential handling of traffic flows based on QoS parameters
       assigned to them.

   Discussion:

       WLANs are particularly subject to congestion issues, as not only
       is the capacity of a radio link comparatively low, but it is also
       shared by multiple endstations and WTPs.  It is therefore
       essential to support differential handling of traffic based on
       their individual QoS requirements.  For example, voice traffic
       (which is highly delay sensitive but does not occupy much
       bandwidth) should be permitted to take precedence over data
       traffic, whenever both types of traffic are contending for use of
       the wireless medium.  This process is referred to as QoS
       differentiation.

       QoS differentiation may be realized in many different ways.  A
       common method is to use simple prioritization of traffic, with
       delay-sensitive traffic having higher priority for medium access
       versus best-effort traffic.  The IEEE 802.11e standard [802.11e]
       specifies a traffic prioritization and differential medium access
       scheme suitable for IEEE 802.11 WLANs.

3.2.  Data plane terminology

   The terminology in the following subsections relate directly to
   metrics and measurement procedures for data plane functions.

3.2.1.  Aggregate Multicast Throughput

   Definition:

       The maximum aggregate offered load of a set of one or more
       multicast traffic flows that can be presented to a DUT/SUT and
       forwarded without frame loss.

   Discussion:

       As per RFC 1242 [RFC1242], a throughput figure allows vendors to
       report a single value that has proven to be useful in the
       marketplace, and also correlates to the quality of the end-user
       experience.  In some multicast protocols (e.g., push-to-talk
       voice), the loss of even a single multicast frame at even one
       destination may cause noticeable voice quality impairments.  It
       is therefore useful to know the maximum rate at which traffic
       from several different multicast traffic flows can be forwarded
       by the DUT/SUT without frame loss.

       The aggregate multicast throughput is usually obtained from an
       iterative set of forwarding rate measurements.  It is calculated
       by summing, over all the multicast traffic flows in the set, the
       product of the offered load for each flow and the number of
       destinations to which that flow is to be delivered.

3.2.2.  Aggregate Maximum Multicast Forwarding Rate

   Definition:

       The maximum aggregate forwarding rate of a set of one or more
       multicast traffic flows by a DUT/SUT, irrespective of frame loss.

   Discussion:

       The highest forwarding rate of a DUT/SUT may not coincide with
       the throughput, or with the forwarding rate at maximum offered
       load (FRMOL - see RFC 2285 [RFC2285]).  The maximum aggregate
       multicast forwarding rate figure enables the intrinsic multicast
       handling capacity of the DUT/SUT datapath to be assessed, and is
       useful in situations where some degree of loss can be tolerated
       (e.g., multicast video).

       The aggregate maximum multicast forwarding rate is usually
       obtained from an iterative set of forwarding rate measurements.
       It is calculated by summing, over all the multicast traffic flows
       in the set, the number of frames per second delivered to each
       destination of each traffic flow.

   Definition:

       A predefined set of minimum acceptable values for specific
       properties of a forwarded unicast or multicast traffic flow.

   Discussion:

       Traffic flows such as voice and video need to adhere to a certain
       level of service quality in order for the application layer to
       provide an adequate level of service to the end user.  For
       example a voice traffic flow must keep packet losses and delays



Ahuja, et al.             Expires July 5, 2008                 [Page 25]

       below specific levels; otherwise, the audio quality at the
       receiving end will be poor.  A test of the QoS-related
       performance of a DUT/SUT must therefore also specify the minimum
       acceptable values for measurable parameters of the forwarded
       traffic flow(s), in order to determine the performance of the
       DUT/SUT.

       For most RTP-based traffic, four parameters are of interest in
       this regard: the average latency, the smoothed interarrival
       jitter (see RFC 3550 [RFC3550]), the average packet loss, and the
       loss burst distribution.  The QoS threshold for a test specifies
       the maximum acceptable levels of these parameters.

       QoS thresholds vary depending on the needs of the application;
       for G.711 VoIP flows, for instance, a generally accepted QoS
       threshold is an average latency of 60 msec, a maximum jitter of
       30 msec, a maximum packet loss of 1%, and a maximum burst loss of
       1 packet.  The specific QoS threshold used for a test MUST be
       reported.

       Once a QoS threshold is defined, the test may be conducted by
       varying one or more test conditions - e.g., the offered load -
       while ensuring that the measured values of the above four
       parameters do not exceed the QoS threshold.

       The maximum number of wireless endstations that can be
       simultaneously associated with a DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:

       The number of wireless endstations that can be concurrently
       supported by a WLAN is an important metric, as it affects the
       scalability of the WLAN.  Further, the supported endstations
       cannot merely achieve the state of being associated; they must be
       able to transfer data as well.  If data cannot be forwarded to
       (or from) an associated endstation by the DUT/SUT, then the
       endstation should not be counted towards the maximum number of
       concurrently supported endstations.

       associate with wireless controller.

   Discussion:

       The rate at which wireless endstations associate with a WLAN is
       an important metric, as it affects both the scalability and the
       responsiveness of the WLAN.  Further, the associated endstations
       cannot merely achieve the state of being associated; they must
       all be able to transfer data as well.  If data cannot be
       forwarded to (or from) an associated endstation by the DUT/SUT,
       then the endstation should not be counted towards the association
       rate measurement.

   Definition:

       The maximum number of WTPs that can be simultaneously provisioned
       by an AC.

   Discussion:

       The number of WTPs that can be discovered and concurrently
       maintained by an AC (i.e., the DUT/SUT) affects the scalability
       of the WLAN and is therefore an essential metric.  Further, the
       supported WTPs cannot merely achieve the state of being
       provisioned; they must be able to associate endstations and
       transfer data to/from them as well.  If endstations cannot be
       associated, or data cannot be forwarded to (or from) associated
       endstations via a WTP, then it should not be counted towards the
       maximum number of concurrently supported WTPs.

3.3.4.  Roaming rate

   Definition:

       The rate at which endstations can roam from the coverage area of
       one WTP to another (i.e., between WTPs) without failure.

   Discussion:

       A busy enterprise network, particularly one containing a number
       of VoIP handsets (i.e., mobile phones) may see a large number of
       roaming events per second as devices move between WTP coverage
       areas.  In such situations it is essential to ensure that roaming
       takes place without failures (e.g., failed reassociations, or
       excessively delayed reassociations).  This is particularly true
       in the case of VoIP handsets, where a roaming failure can cause
       dropped calls or degraded voice quality.  The maximum roaming
       rate that can be sustained by the WLAN infrastructure is
       therefore of significant interest.

       The roaming rate measurement is invalidated by the presence of
       roaming failures.  The failure of the association handshakes with
       the new WTP is relatively straightforward to determine (as the
       handshakes themselves convey status messages and have predefined
       timeouts and retry limits), but the length of time to wait for
       resumption of data service is not well defined.  A delay
       threshold is therefore defined as part of the measurement
       process, and a roam is considered to have failed if this
       threshold is exceeded.

       The distribution of endstations among WTPs within the DUT/SUT
       usually has material impact on the roaming rate and therefore
       SHOULD be specified by the measurement procedure.

3.3.5.  Roaming delay

   Definition:

       The time interval between the initiation and successful
       completion of a roaming event.

   Discussion:

       Movement of an endstation between WTP coverage areas, which
       causes roaming events to occur, requires some finite time to
       complete, during which data traffic may be interrupted.  The
       duration of such data traffic interruption has a material impact
       on the perceived capability of the WLAN to support mobile
       endstations.  For instance, an excessive period of traffic
       interruption may cause voice calls to be dropped or TCP
       connections to close their windows.  A measurement of roaming
       delay is thus a useful component of WLAN infrastructure
       performance.

       The roaming delay is ideally measured from the point at which the
       roaming decision is made to the point at which data service is
       completely restored (the roam completes without a roaming
       failure).  With reference to the WLAN infrastructure, therefore,
       the roaming delay is the time from the roaming decision to the
       first valid downstream data frame delivered to the endstation by
       the new WTP.

       In some situations the exact point at which the roaming decision
       is made cannot be accurately ascertained, such as when using
       actual endstations rather than dedicated test equipment during
       the measurement process.  In this case, the roaming delay is
       measured as the time between the last valid data frame delivered
       to the endstation by the old WTP to the first valid data frame
       delivered to the endstation by the new WTP.  The use of this
       alternative measurement process MUST be noted along with the

       measurement results.

       In both cases, delivery of a data frame implies that the
       endstation has received the data frame without error and has
       issued, or has been observed to issue, an IEEE 802.11
       acknowledgement packet for that data frame.

       A roaming event MUST NOT be counted towards roaming delay
       measurements if a roaming failure occurs.

       The distribution of endstations among WTPs within the DUT/SUT
       usually has material impact on the roaming delay and therefore
       SHOULD be specified by the measurement procedure.

3.3.6.  Reset duration

   Definition:

       The time period for which a reset is applied to the DUT/SUT, or
       the time period for which the DUT/SUT is physically powered down.

   Discussion:

       In reset recovery and failover recovery measurements, the
       duration for which a reset or power-off is applied can frequently
       affect the test results.  If the reset or power-off is applied
       for too short a period, anomalous behavior can occur (such as the
       DUT/SUT failing to reset at all).  If the reset is applied for
       too long a period, then unwanted effects such as TCP connections
       being closed or association context being cleared can interfere
       with the test.  Reset or power-off should therefore be applied to
       the DUT/SUT for a period sufficient to ensure a full reset of the
       DUT/SUT, but not long enough to cause higher-layer connections to
       time out.

   Definition:

       The time period from the removal of reset from the DUT/SUT (or
       the power-up of the DUT/SUT) to the resumption of normal
       operation.

   Discussion:

       The reset recovery time quantifies the duration of service outage
       after a catastrophic event such as a power interruption.  It
       consists of two parts: the AC reset recovery time, and the
       product of the rate of WTP association multiplied by the number
       of WTPs present.  The AC recovery time forms the fixed component
       of the reset recovery time, while the latter product forms the
       variable component.  As the SUT increases in scale (i.e.,
       comprises a larger number of WTPs) the reset recovery time
       usually increases proportionally.

           Reset recovery time = AC reset recovery time + (Rate of WTP
           association * Number of WTPs)

       The measurement of the reset recovery time MUST include the time
       required for all of the WTPs to reassociate the endstations and
       begin transferring data.  Until the last WTP has successfully
       restored service to the last endstation, the reset recovery
       process cannot be considered complete.

3.3.8.  WTP association rate

   Definition:

       The rate at which WTPs can be discovered and provisioned by an
       AC.

   Discussion:

       The number of WTPs present in a large enterprise WLAN may range
       into the thousands, with each AC being called upon to provision
       and manage hundreds of WTPs at a time.  The rate at which the ACs
       can discover and provision (i.e., associate) WTPs therefore
       limits the speed with which the WLAN can recover from
       catastrophic events such as power interruptions or connectivity
       changes, and thus constitutes an important metric.

       This metric is associated with the reset recovery test, and forms
       the variable portion of the reset recovery time.  A WTP is not
       considered to be successfully provisioned by an AC until it has
       reassociated all the endstations formerly associated to it and
       begins transferring data to/from them.

       Note that caching of WTP information by an AC can increase the
       WTP association rate for all subsequent associations after the
       first one.  See section 3.1.7.

3.3.9.  AC reset recovery time

   Definition:

       The time period from the removal of reset from the DUT/SUT (or
       the power-up of the DUT/SUT) to the successful provisioning of
       the first WTP.

   Discussion:

       The AC reset recovery time is the fixed portion of the reset
       recovery time, and indicates the minimum time required for an AC
       with at least one connected WTP to recover from a catastrophic
       event such as a power interruption.  This time is mainly required
       for the AC to restart and reinitialize itself, discover the first
       WTP, provision it, reassociate the first endstation on the WTP,
       and finally begin transferring data to the endstation.  (If the
       DUT/SUT contains or connects to more than one WTP, then the
       actual reset recovery time is extended by the time required to
       provision the additional WTPs and resume normal operation.)

       The measurement of the AC reset recovery time MUST include the
       time required for one WTP to reassociate one endstation and begin
       transferring data to it.

3.3.10.  Failover recovery time

   Definition:

       The time required to restore service after a catastrophic
       hardware or software event in the DUT/SUT.

   Discussion:

       The availability of the WLAN infrastructure is of interest when
       assessing the uptime and service quality of an enterprise
       network.  In fact, to ensure uninterrupted availability, vendors
       often provide redundant elements in their systems (e.g., a backup
       AC to take over when the primary AC fails).  Further, if an AC is
       manually reset, it should recover from the reset condition,
       reconnect all the attached WTPs, and restore service to
       endstations as rapidly as possible; this avoids issues such as
       dropped voice calls and failed TCP sessions.

       The recovery time in the case of either a reset recovery">
       measurement, or a failover recovery measurement, is measured from
       the onset of the reset or failure event (e.g., a forced failover
       signal) to the restoration of data service.  Restoration of data
       service is deemed to have occurred when data packets are once
       again received by the endstations associated with the DUT/SUT.

       Note that in the case of failover measurements on DUTs/SUTs
       incorporating hot-standby redundancy, it is possible for the
       recovery time to be zero, i.e., no data loss or interruption of
       service is noted.

4.  Security Considerations

   Documents of this type do not directly affect the security of the
   Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking is not
   performed on devices or systems connected to operating networks.

   Note that performance tests SHOULD be done on with adequate isolation
   between the DUT and the remainder of the network, or with security
   systems enabled, to avoid the possibility of compromising the
   performance of operating networks in some manner.
