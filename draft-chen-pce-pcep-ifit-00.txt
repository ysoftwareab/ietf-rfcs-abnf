  Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions to
                              Enable IFIT
                      draft-chen-pce-pcep-ifit-00

Abstract

   This document defines PCEP extensions to distribute In-situ Flow
   Information Telemetry (IFIT) information.  So that IFIT behavior can
   be enabled automatically when the path is instantiated.  In-situ Flow
   Information Telemetry (IFIT) refers to network OAM data plane on-path
   telemetry techniques, in particular the most popular are In-situ OAM
   (IOAM) and Alternate Marking.  The IFIT attributes here described can
   be generalized for all path types but the application to Segment
   Routing (SR) is considered in this document.  The SR policy is a set
   of candidate SR paths consisting of one or more segment lists and
   necessary path attributes.  It enables instantiation of an ordered
   list of segments with a specific intent for traffic steering.

1.  Introduction

   In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (IFIT) refers to network OAM data
   plane on-path telemetry techniques, including In-situ OAM (IOAM)
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] and Alternate Marking [RFC8321].  It can
   provide flow information on the entire forwarding path on a per-
   packet basis in real time.

   An automatic network requires the Service Level Agreement (SLA)
   monitoring on the deployed service.  So that the system can quickly
   detect the SLA violation or the performance degradation, hence to
   change the service deployment.

   This document defines extensions to PCEP to distribute paths carrying
   IFIT information.  So that IFIT behavior can be enabled automatically
   when the path is instantiated.

   RFC 5440 [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol
   (PCEP) as a communication mechanism between a Path Computation Client
   (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or between a PCE and a
   PCE.

   RFC 8231 [RFC8231] specifies extensions to PCEP to enable stateful
   control and it describes two modes of operation: passive stateful PCE
   and active stateful PCE.  Further, RFC 8281 [RFC8281] describes the
   setup, maintenance, and teardown of PCE-initiated LSPs for the
   stateful PCE model, while RFC 8733 [RFC8733] is focused on the active
   stateful PCE, where the LSPs are controlled by the PCE.

   When a PCE is used to initiate paths using PCEP, it is important that
   the head end of the path also understands the IFIT behavior that is
   intended for the path.  When PCEP is in use for path initiation it
   makes sense for that same protocol to be used to also carry the IFIT
   attributes that describe the IOAM or Alternate Marking procedure that
   needs to be applied to the data that flow those paths.

   The PCEP extension defined in this document allows to signal the IFIT
   capabilities.  In this way IFIT methods are automatically activated
   and running.  The flexibility and dynamicity of the IFIT applications
   are given by the use of additional functions on the controller and on
   the network nodes, but this is out of scope here.

   The Use Case of Segment Routing (SR) is discussed considering that
   IFIT methods are becoming mature for Segment Routing over the MPLS
   data plane (SR-MPLS) and Segment Routing over IPv6 data plane (SRv6).
   In this way SR policy native IFIT can facilitate the closed loop
   control and enable the automation of SR service.

   Segment Routing (SR) policy [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy]
   is a set of candidate SR paths consisting of one or more segment
   lists and necessary path attributes.  It enables instantiation of an
   ordered list of segments with a specific intent for traffic steering.

   It is to be noted the companion document [I-D.qin-idr-sr-policy-ifit]
   that proposes the BGP extension to enable IFIT methods for SR policy.

2.  PCEP Extensions for IFIT Attributes

   This document is to add IFIT attribute TLVs as PCEP Extensions.  The
   following sections will describe the requirement and usage of
   different IFIT modes, and define the corresponding TLV encoding in
   PCEP.

   The IFIT attributes here described can be generalized and included as
   TLVs carried inside the LSPA (LSP Attributes) object in order to be
   applied for all path types, as long as they support the relevant data
   plane telemetry method.  IFIT TLVs are o ptional and can be taken
   into account by the PCE during path computation.  In general, the
   LSPA object is carried within a PCInitiate message or a PCRpt
   message.

   In this document it is considered the case of SR Policy since IOAM
   and Alternate Marking are more mature especially for Segment Routing
   (SR) and for IPv6.

2.1.  IFIT for SR Policies

   RFC 8664 [RFC8664] and [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] specify
   extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
   (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate Traffic-
   Engineering (TE) paths, as well as a Path Computation Client (PCC) to
   request a path subject to certain constraints and optimization
   criteria in SR networks both for SR-MPLS and SRv6.

   IFIT attibutes, here defined as TLVs for the LSPA object, complement
   both RFC 8664 [RFC8664], [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp].

3.  IFIT capability advertisement TLV

   During the PCEP initialization phase, PCEP speakers (PCE or PCC)
   SHOULD advertise their support of IFIT methods (e.g.  IOAM and
   Alternate Marking).

   A PCEP speaker includes the IFIT TLVs in the OPEN object to advertise
   its support for PCEP IFIT extensions.

   RFC 8664 [RFC8664] and and [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] define
   a new Path Setup Type (PST) for SR and also define the SR-PCE-
   CAPABILITY sub-TLV.  This document defined a new IFIT-CAPABILITY TLV,
   that is an optional TLV for use in the OPEN Object for IFIT
   attributes via PCEP capability advertisement.

   Where:

   Type: to be assigned by IANA.

   Length: The Length field defines the length of the value portion in
   bytes as per RFC 5440 [RFC5440].

   Flag: No flags are defined for this TLV in this document.  Unassigned
   bits are considered reserved.  They MUST be set to 0 on transmission
   and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   Advertisement of the IFIT-CAPABILITY TLV implies support of IFIT
   methods (IOAM and/or Alternate Marking) as well as the objects, TLVs,
   and procedures defined in this document.  It is worth mentioning that
   IOAM and Alternate Marking can be activated one at a time or can
   coexist; so it is possible to have only IOAM or only Alternate
   Marking enabled but they are recognized in general as IFIT
   capability.

4.  IFIT Attributes TLV

   The IFIT TLV provides the configurable knobs of the IFIT feature, and
   it can be included as an optional TLV in the LSPA object (as
   described in RFC 5440 [RFC5440]).

   For a PCE-initiated LSP RFC 8281 [RFC8281], this TLV is included in
   the LSPA object with the PCInitiate message.  For the PCC-initiated
   delegated LSPs, this TLV is carried in the Path Computation State
   Report (PCRpt) message in the LSPA object.  This TLV is also carried
   in the LSPA object with the Path Computation Update Request (PCUpd)
   message to direct the PCC (LSP head-end) to make updates to IFIT
   attributes.

   The TLV is encoded in all PCEP messages for the LSP if IFIT feature
   is enabled.  The absence of the TLV indicates the PCEP speaker wishes
   to disable the feature.  This TLV includes multiple IFIT-ATTRIBUTES
   sub-TLVs.  The IFIT-ATTRIBUTES sub-TLVs are included if there is a
   change since the last information sent in the PCEP message.  The
   default values for missing sub-TLVs apply for the first PCEP message
   for the LSP.

   The format of the IFIT-ATTRIBUTES TLV is shown in the following
   figure:

              Fig. 3 Sub-TLV Types of the IFIT-ATTRIBUTES TLV

4.1.  IOAM Sub-TLVs

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data] records operational and telemetry
   information in the packet while the packet traverses a path between
   two points in the network.  In terms of the classification given in
   RFC 7799 [RFC7799] IOAM could be categorized as Hybrid Type 1.  IOAM
   mechanisms can be leveraged where active OAM do not apply or do not
   offer the desired results.

   For the SR use case, when SR policy enables IOAM, the IOAM header
   will be inserted into every packet of the traffic that is steered
   into the SR paths.  Since this document aims to define the control
   plane, it is to be noted that a relevant document for the data plane
   is [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-ipv6-options] for Segment Routing over IPv6
   data plane (SRv6).

4.1.1.  IOAM Pre-allocated Trace Option Sub-TLV

   The IOAM tracing data is expected to be collected at every node that
   a packet traverses to ensure visibility into the entire path a packet
   takes within an IOAM domain.  The preallocated tracing option will
   create pre-allocated space for each node to populate its information.

   The format of IOAM pre-allocated trace option Sub-TLV is defined as
   follows:

   described in section 4.6 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].

4.2.  Enhanced Alternate Marking Sub-TLV

   The Alternate Marking [RFC8321]technique is an hybrid performance
   measurement method, per RFC 7799 [RFC7799] classification of
   measurement methods.  Because this method is based on marking
   consecutive batches of packets.  It can be used to measure packet
   loss, latency, and jitter on live traffic.

   For the SR use case, since this document aims to define the control
   plane, it is to be noted that a relevant document for the data plane
   is [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark] for Segment Routing over IPv6 data
   plane (SRv6).

   The format of Enhanced Alternate Marking (EAM) Sub-TLV is defined as
   follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Type: 5 (to be assigned by IANA).

   Length: the total length of the value field not including Type and
   Length fields.

   FlowMonID: A 20-bit identifier to uniquely identify a monitored flow
   within the measurement domain.  The definition is the same as
   described in section 5.3 of [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark].  It is to
   be noted that PCE also needs to maintain the uniqueness of FlowMonID
   as described in [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-alt-mark].

   Period: Time interval between two alternate marking period.  The unit
   is second.

   Rsvd: A 4-bit field reserved for further usage.  It MUST be zero.

5.  Example of operation

5.1.  PCE Initiated SR Policy with single or multiple candidate-paths

   A PCC or PCE sets the IFIT-CAPABILITY TLV in the Open message during
   the PCEP initialization phase to indicate that it supports the IFIT
   procedures.

   1.  For single candidate-path, PCE sends PCInitiate message,
   containing the SRPAG Association object
   ([I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp]) and IFIT-ATTRIBUTES via
   LSPA TLVs.  For multiple candidate-paths, PCE sends a separate
   PCInitiate message for every candidate path that it wants to create,
   or it sends multiple LSP objects within a single PCInitiate message.
   The SRPAG Association object
   ([I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-policy-cp]) is sent for every LSP in
   the PCInitiate message and the IFIT-ATTRIBUTES are sent as LSPA TLVs.

   2.  For single candidate-path, PCC uses the color, endpoint and
   preference from the SRPAG object to create a new candidate path.  If
   no SR policy exists to hold the candidate path, then a new SR policy
   is created to hold the new candidate-path considering the IFIT LSPA
   TLVs too.  For multiple candidate-paths, PCC creates multiple
   candidate paths under the same SR policy, identified by Color and
   Endpoint and also IFIT-ATTRIBUTES.

   3.  For both single candidate-path and multiple candidate-paths, PCC
   sends a PCRpt message back to the PCE to report the newly created
   Candidate Path.  The PCRpt message contains the SRPAG Association
   object and IFIT-ATTRIBUTES information.

   +-+-+                            +-+-+
   |PCC|                            |PCE|
   +-+-+                            +-+-+
     |                                |
     |<--PCInitiate-------------------|
     |                                |
     |---PCRpt----------------------->|
     |                                |


   The procedure of enabling/disabling IFIT is simple, indeed the PCE
   can update the IFIT-ATTRIBUTES of the LSP by sending subsequent Path
   Computation Update Request (PCUpd) messages.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the new IFIT-CAPABILITY TLV and IFIT-ATTRIBUTES
   TLV.  IANA is requested to make the assignment from the "PCEP TLV
   Type Indicators" subregistry of the "Path Computation Element
   Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry as follows:

   Value        Description                      Reference
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   TBD1         IFIT-CAPABILITY                  This document

   TBD2         IFIT-ATTRIBUTES                  This document

   This document also specifies the IFIT-ATTRIBUTES sub-TLVs.  IANA is
   requested to create an "IFIT-ATTRIBUTES Sub-TLV Types" subregistry
   within the "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers"
   registry.

   This document defines the following types:

   Type      Description                         Reference

7.  Security Considerations

   This document defines the new IFIT-CAPABILITY TLV and IFIT Attributes
   TLVs, which do not add any substantial new security concerns beyond
   those already discussed in RFC 8231 [RFC8231] and RFC 8281 [RFC8281]
   for stateful PCE operations.
