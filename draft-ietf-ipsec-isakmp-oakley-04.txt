1. Abstract

   [MSST96] (ISAKMP) provides a framework for authentication and key
   exchange but does not define them.  ISAKMP is designed to be key
   exchange independant; that is, it is designed to support many
   different key exchanges.

   [Orm96] (Oakley) describes a series of key exchanges-- called
   "modes"-- and details the services provided by each (e.g. perfect
   forward secrecy for keys, identity protection, and authentication).

   [Kra96] (SKEME) describes a versatile key exchange technique which
   provides anonymity, repudiability, and quick key refreshment.

   This document describes a protocol using part of Oakley and part of
   SKEME in conjunction with ISAKMP to obtain authenticated keying
   material for use with ISAKMP, and for other security associations
   such as AH and ESP for the IETF IPsec DOI.

2. Discussion

   This draft describes a hybrid protocol. The purpose is to negotiate,
   and provide authenticated keying material for, security associations
   in a protected manner.

   Processes which implement this draft can be used for negotiating
   virtual private networks (VPNs) and also for providing a remote user
   from a remote site (whose IP address need not be known beforehand)
   access to a secure host or network.

   Proxy negotiation is supported.  Proxy mode is where the negotiating
   parties are not the endpoints for which security association
   negotiation is taking place.  When used in proxy mode, the identities
   of the end parties remain hidden.

   This does not implement the entire Oakley protocol, but only a subset
   necessary to satisfy its goals. It does not claim conformance or
   compliance with the entire Oakley protocol.

   Likewise, this does not implement the entire SKEME protocol, but only
   the method of public key encryption for authentication and its
   concept of fast re-keying using an exchange of nonces.

3. Terms and Definitions

3.1 Requirements Terminology

   Keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and
   "MAY" that appear in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in [Bra97].

3.2 Notation

   The following notation is used throughout this draft.

      HDR is an ISAKMP header whose exchange type is the mode.  When
      writen as HDR* it indicates payload encryption.

      SA is an SA negotiation payload with one or more proposals. An
      initiator MAY provide multiple proposals for negotiation; a
      responder MUST reply with only one.

      SAp is the entire body of the SA payload (minus the ISAKMP generic
      header)-- i.e. the DOI, situation, all proposals and all
      transforms offered by the Initiator.

      g^xi and g^xr are the Diffie-Hellman public values of the

      initiator and responder respectively.

      KE is the key exchange payload.

      Nx is the nonce payload; x can be: i or r for the ISAKMP initiator
      and responder respectively.

      IDx is the identity payload for "x".  x can be: "ii" or "ir" for
      the ISAKMP initiator and responder respectively during phase one
      negotiation; or "ui" or "ur" for the user initiator and responder
      respectively during phase two.  The ID payload format for the
      Internet DOI is defined in [Pip96].

      SIG is the signature payload. The data to sign is exchange-
      specific.

      CERT is the certificate payload.

      HASH (and any derivitive such as HASH(2) or HASH_I) is the hash
      payload. The contents of the hash are specific to the
      authentication method.

      prf(key, msg) is the keyed pseudo-random function-- often a keyed
      hash function-- used to generate a deterministic output that
      appears pseudo-random.  prf's are used both for key derivations
      and for authentication (i.e. as a keyed MAC). (See [KBC96]).

      SKEYID is a string derived from secret material known only to the
      active players in the exchange.

      SKEYID_e is the keying material used by the ISAKMP SA to protect
      it's messages.

      SKEYID_a is the keying material used by the ISAKMP SA to
      authenticate it's messages.

      SKEYID_d is the keying material used to derive keys for non-ISAKMP
      security associations.

      <x>y indicates that "x" is encrypted with the key "y".

      --> signifies "initiator to responder" communication (requests).

      <-- signifies "responder to initiator" communication (replies).

       |  signifies concatenation of information-- e.g. X | Y is the
      concatentation of X with Y.




Harkins, Carrel                                         	[Page 3]

      [x] indicates that x is optional.

   Payload encryption (when noted by a '*' after the ISAKMP header) MUST
   begin immediately after the ISAKMP header. When communication is
   protected, all payloads following the ISAKMP header MUST be
   encrypted.  Encryption keys are generated from SKEYID_e in a manner
   that is defined for each algorithm.

   When used to describe the payloads contained in complete message
   exchanges, the ISAKMP generic header is implicitly included. When
   used as part of a prf computation, the ISAKMP generic header is not
   included unless specifically noted. For example, the initiator may
   send the responder the following message:
     HDR, KE, Ni
   The ISAKMP header is included in the KE and Ni payloads. But if the
   initiator generates the following pseudo-random output:
     HASH = prf(key, Ni | Nr)
   the ISAKMP headers of the two nonce payloads are not included-- only
   the body of the payload-- the nonce itself-- is used.

3.3 Perfect Forward Secrecy

   When used in the draft Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) refers to the
   notion that compromise of a single key will permit access to only
   data protected by a single key. For PFS to exist the key used to
   protect transmission of data MUST NOT be used to derive any
   additional keys, and if the key used to protect transmission of data
   was derived from some other keying material, that material MUST NOT
   be used to derive any more keys.

   Perfect Forward Secrecy for both keys and identities is provided in
   this protocol. (Sections 5.8 and 7).

3.4 Security Association

   A security association (SA) is a set of policy and key used to
   protect information. The ISAKMP SA is the shared policy and key used
   by the negotiating peers in this protocol to protect their
   communication.

4. Introduction

   Oakley defines a method to establish an authenticated key exchange.
   This includes how payloads are constructed, the information they
   carry, the order in which they are processed and how they are used.

   While Oakley defines "modes", ISAKMP defines "phases".  The
   relationship between the two is very straightforward.  ISAKMP's phase



Harkins, Carrel                                         	[Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 July 1997


   1 is where the two ISAKMP peers establish a secure, authenticated
   channel with which to communicate.  This is called the ISAKMP
   Security Association (SA). "Main Mode" and "Aggressive Mode" each
   accomplish a phase 1 exchange.  "Main Mode" and "Aggressive Mode"
   MUST ONLY be used in phase 1.

   Phase 2 is where Security Associations are negotiated on behalf of
   services such as IPsec or any other service which needs key material
   and/or parameter negotiation. "Quick Mode" accomplishes a phase 2
   exchange. "Quick Mode" MUST ONLY be used in phase 2.

   "New Group Mode" is not really a phase 1 or phase 2.  It follows
   phase 1, but serves to establish a new group which can be used in
   future negotiations. "New Group Mode" MUST ONLY be used in phase 2.

   The ISAKMP SA is bi-directional. That is, once established, either
   party may initiate Quick Mode, Informational, and New Group Mode
   Exchanges.  Per the base ISAKMP document, the ISAKMP SA is identified
   by the Initiator's cookie followed by the Responder's cookie-- the
   role of each party in the phase 1 exchange dictates which cookie is
   the Initiator's. The cookie order established by the phase 1 exchange
   continues to identify the ISAKMP SA regardless of the direction the
   Quick Mode, Informational, or New Group exchange. In other words, the
   cookies MUST NOT swap places when the direction of the ISAKMP SA
   changes.

   With the use of ISAKMP phases, an implementation can accomplish very
   fast keying when necessary.  A single phase 1 negotiation may be used
   for more than one phase 2 negotiation.  Additionally a single phase 2
   negotiation can request multiple Security Associations.  With these
   optimizations, an implementation can see less than one round trip per
   SA as well as less than one DH exponentiation per SA.  "Main Mode"
   for phase 1 provides identity protection.  When identity protection
   is not needed, "Aggressive Mode" can be used to reduce round trips
   even further.  Developer hints for doing these optimizations are
   included below. It should also be noted that using public key
   encryption to authenticate an Aggressive Mode exchange will still
   provide identity protection.

   The following attributes are used by ISAKMP/Oakley and are negotiated
   as part of the ISAKMP Security Association.  (These attributes
   pertain only to the ISAKMP Security Association and not to any
   Security Associations that ISAKMP may be negotiating on behalf of
   other services.)

      - encryption algorithm (e.g. DES, IDEA, Blowfish).

      - hash algorithm (e.g. MD5, SHA)



Harkins, Carrel                                         	[Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 July 1997


      - authentication method (e.g. DSS sig, RSA sig, RSA encryption,
      pre-shared key)

      - information about a group over which to do Diffie-Hellman.

      - prf (e.g. 3DES-CBC-MAC)

   All of these attributes are mandatory and MUST be negotiated except
   for the "prf".  The "prf" MAY be negotiated, but if it is not, the
   HMAC (see [KBC96]) version of the negotiated hash algorithm is used
   as a pseudo-random function. Other non-mandatory attributes are
   described in Appendix A. The selected hash algorithm MUST support
   both native and HMAC modes.

   ISAKMP/Oakley implementations MUST support the following attribute
   values:

      - DES-CBC with a weak, and semi-weak, key check (weak and semi-
      weak keys are referenced in [Sch94] and listed in Appendix A). The
      key is derived according to Appendix B.

      - MD5 and SHA.

      - Authentication via pre-shared keys. The Digital Signature
      Standard SHOULD be supported; RSA SHOULD also be supported.

      - MODP over the default group (see below). ECP groups MAY be
      supported.

   The ISAKMP/Oakley modes described here MUST be implemented whenever
   the IETF IPsec DOI [Pip96] is implemented. Other DOIs MAY use the
   modes described here.

5. Exchanges

   There are two basic methods used to establish an authenticated key
   exchange: Main Mode and Aggressive Mode. Each generates authenticated
   keying material from an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exchange. Main Mode
   MUST be implemented; Aggressive Mode SHOULD be implemented. In
   addition, Quick Mode MUST be implemented as a mechanism to generate
   fresh keying material and negotiate non-ISAKMP security services. In
   additon, New Group Mode SHOULD be implemented as a mechanism to
   define private groups for Diffie-Hellman exchanges. Implementations
   MUST NOT switch exchange types in the middle of an exchange.

   Exchanges conform to standard ISAKMP [MSST96] payload syntax,
   attribute encoding, timeouts and retransmits of messages, and
   informational messages-- e.g a notify response is sent when, for



Harkins, Carrel                                         	[Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 July 1997


   example, a proposal is unacceptable, or a signature verification or
   decryption was unsuccessful, etc.

   Main Mode is an instantiation of the ISAKMP Identity Protect
   Exchange: The first two messages negotiate policy; the next two
   exchange Diffie-Hellman public values and ancillary data (e.g.
   nonces) necessary for the exchange; and the last two messages
   authenticate the Diffie-Hellman Exchange. The authentication method
   negotiated as part of the initial ISAKMP exchange influences the
   composition of the payloads but not their purpose. The XCHG for Main
   Mode is ISAKMP Identity Protect.

   Similarly, Aggressive Mode is an instantiation of the ISAKMP
   Aggressive Exchange. The first two messages negotiate policy,
   exchange Diffie-Hellman public values and ancillary data necessary
   for the exchange, and identities.  In addition the second message
   authenticates the responder. The third message authenticates the
   initiator and provides a proof of participation in the exchange. The
   XCHG for Aggressive Mode is ISAKMP Aggressive.  The final message is
   not sent under protection of the ISAKMP SA allowing each party to
   postpone exponentiation, if desired, until negotiation of this
   exchange is complete.

   Quick Mode and New Group Mode have no analog in ISAKMP. The XCHG
   values for Quick Mode and New Group Mode are defined in Appendix A.

   Except where noted, there is no requirement for ISAKMP payloads in
   any exchagen to be in any particular order.

   Three different authentication methods are allowed with either Main
   Mode or Aggressive Mode-- digital signature, public key encryption,
   or pre-shared key. The value SKEYID is computed seperately for each
   authentication method.

       For signatures:             SKEYID = prf(Ni | Nr, g^xy)
       For public key encryption:  SKEYID = prf(Ni | Nr, CKY-I | CKY-R)
       For pre-shared keys:        SKEYID = prf(pre-shared-key, Ni | Nr)

   The result of either Main Mode or Aggressive Mode is three groups of
   authenticated keying material:

      SKEYID_d = prf(SKEYID, g^xy | CKY-I | CKY-R | 0)
      SKEYID_a = prf(SKEYID, SKEYID_d | g^xy | CKY-I | CKY-R | 1)
      SKEYID_e = prf(SKEYID, SKEYID_a | g^xy | CKY-I | CKY-R | 2)

   and agreed upon policy to protect further communications. The values
   of 0, 1, and 2 above are represented by a single octet. The key used
   for encryption is derived from SKEYID_e in an algorithm-specific



Harkins, Carrel                                         	[Page 7]

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 July 1997


   manner (see appendix B).

   To authenticate either exchange the initiator of the protocol
   generates HASH_I and the responder generates HASH_R where:

      HASH_I = prf(SKEYID, g^xi | g^xr | CKY-I | CKY-R | SAp | IDii)
      HASH_R = prf(SKEYID, g^xr | g^xi | CKY-R | CKY-I | SAp | IDir)

   For authentication with digital signatures, HASH_I and HASH_R are
   signed and verified; for authentication with either public key
   encryption or pre-shared keys, HASH_I and HASH_R directly
   authenticate the exchange.

   As mentioned above, the negotiated authentication method influences
   the content and use of messages for Phase 1 Modes, but not their
   intent.  When using public keys for authentication, the Phase 1
   exchange can be accomplished either by using signatures or by using
   public key encryption (if the algorithm supports it). Following are
   Main Mode Exchanges with different authentication options.

5.1 ISAKMP/Oakley Phase 1 Authenticated With Signatures

   Using signatures, the ancillary information exchanged during the
   second roundtrip are nonces; the exchange is authenticated by signing
   a mutually obtainable hash. Main Mode with signature authentication
   is described as follows:

        Initiator                          Responder
       ----------                         -----------
        HDR, SA                     -->
                                    <--    HDR, SA
        HDR, KE, Ni                 -->
                                    <--    HDR, KE, Nr
        HDR*, IDii, [ CERT, ] SIG_I -->
                                    <--    HDR*, IDir, [ CERT, ] SIG_R

   Aggressive mode with signatures in conjunction with ISAKMP is
   described as follows:

        Initiator                          Responder
       -----------                        -----------
        HDR, SA, KE, Ni, IDii       -->
                                    <--    HDR, SA, KE, Nr, IDir,
                                                [ CERT, ] SIG_R
        HDR, [ CERT, ] SIG_I        -->

   In both modes, the signed data, SIG_I or SIG_R, is the result of the
   negotiated digital signature algorithm applied to HASH_I or HASH_R



Harkins, Carrel                                         	[Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 July 1997


   respectively.

   In general the signature will be over HASH_I and HASH_R as above
   using the negotiated prf, or the HMAC version of the negotiated hash
   function (if no prf is negotiated). However, this can be overridden
   for construction of the signature if the signature algorithm is tied
   to a particular hash algorithm (e.g. DSS is only defined with SHA's
   160 bit output). In this case, the signature will be over HASH_I and
   HASH_R as above, except using the HMAC version of the hash algorithm
   associated with the signature method.  The negotiated prf and hash
   function would continue to be used for all other proscribed pseudo-
   random functions.

   Since the hash algorithm used is already known there is no need to
   encode its OID into the signature. In addition, there is no binding
   between the OIDs used for RSA signatures in PKCS #1 and those used in
   this document. Therefore, RSA signatures MUST be encoded as a private
   key encryption in PKCS #1 format. DSS signatures MUST be encoded as r
   followed by s.

   One or more certificate payloads MAY be optionally passed.

5.2 Phase 1 Authenticated With Public Key Encryption

   Using public key encryption to authenticate the exchange, the
   ancillary information exchanged is encrypted nonces. Each party's
   ability to reconstruct a hash (proving that the other party decrypted
   the nonce) authenticates the exchange.

   In order to perform the public key encryption, the initiator must
   already have the responder's public key. In the case where the
   responder has multiple public keys, a hash of the certificate the
   initiator is using to encrypt the ancillary information is passed as
   part of the third message. In this way the responder can determine
   which corresponding private key to use to decrypt the encrypted
   payloads and identity protection is retained.

   In addition to the nonce, the identities of the parties (IDii and
   IDir) are also encrypted with the other party's public key. If the
   authentication method is public key encryption, the nonce and
   identity payloads MUST be encrypted with the public key of the other
   party. Only the body of the payloads are encrypted, the payload
   headers are left in the clear.

   When using encrytion for authentication, Main Mode is defined as
   follows.

        Initiator                        Responder
       -----------                      -----------
        HDR, SA                   -->
                                  <--    HDR, SA
        HDR, KE, [ HASH(1), ]
          <IDii>PubKey_r,
            <Ni>PubKey_r          -->
                                         HDR, KE, <IDir>PubKey_i,
                                  <--            <Nr>PubKey_i
        HDR*, HASH_I              -->
                                  <--    HDR*, HASH_R

   Aggressive Mode authenticated with encryption is described as
   follows:

        Initiator                        Responder
       -----------                      -----------
        HDR, SA, [ HASH(1),] KE,
          <IDii>Pubkey_r,
           <Ni>Pubkey_r           -->
                                         HDR, SA, KE, <IDir>PubKey_i,
                                  <--         <Nr>PubKey_r, HASH_R
        HDR, HASH_I               -->

   Where HASH(1) is a hash (using the negotiated hash function) of the
   certificate which the initiator is using to encrypt the nonce and
   identity.

   RSA encryption MUST be encoded in PKCS #1 format. The payload length
   is the length of the entire encrypted payload plus header. The PKCS
   #1 encoding allows for determination of the actual length of the
   cleartext payload upon decryption.

   Using encryption for authentication provides for a plausably deniable
   exchange. There is no proof (as with a digital signature) that the
   conversation ever took place since each party can completely
   reconstruct both sides of the exchange. In addition, security is
   added to secret generation since an attacker would have to
   successfully break not only the Diffie-Hellman exchange but also both
   RSA encryptions. This exchange was motivated by [Kra96].

   Note that, unlike other authentication methods, authentication with
   public key encryption allows for identity protection with Aggressive
   Mode.

5.3 Phase 1 Authenticated With a Pre-Shared Key

   A key derived by some out-of-band mechanism may also be used to
   authenticate the exchange. The actual establishment of this key is
   out of the scope of this document.

   When doing a pre-shared key authentication, Main Mode is defined as
   follows:

              Initiator                        Responder
             ----------                       -----------
              HDR, SA             -->
                                  <--    HDR, SA
              HDR, KE, Ni         -->
                                  <--    HDR, KE, Nr
              HDR*, IDii, HASH_I  -->
                                  <--    HDR*, IDir, HASH_R

   Aggressive mode with a pre-shared key is described as follows:

            Initiator                        Responder
           -----------                      -----------
            HDR, SA, KE, Ni, IDii -->
                                  <--    HDR, SA, KE, Nr, IDir, HASH_R
            HDR, HASH_I           -->

   When using pre-shared key authentication with Main Mode the key can
   only be identified by the IP address of the peers since HASH_I must
   be computed before the initiator has processed IDir. Aggressive Mode
   allows for a wider range of identifiers of the pre-shared secret to
   be used. In addition, Aggressive Mode allows two parties to maintain
   multiple, different pre-shared keys and identify the correct one for
   a particular exchange.

5.4 Phase 2 - Quick Mode

   Quick Mode is not a complete exchange itself, but is used as part of
   the ISAKMP SA negotiation process (phase 2) to derive keying material
   and negotiate shared policy for non-ISAKMP SAs. The information
   exchanged along with Quick Mode MUST be protected by the ISAKMP SA--
   i.e. all payloads except the ISAKMP header are encrypted. In Quick
   Mode, a HASH payload must immediately follow the ISAKMP header. This
   HASH authenticates the message and also provides liveliness proofs.

   Quick Mode is essentially an exchange of nonces that provides replay
   protection. The nonces are used to generate fresh key material and
   prevent replay attacks from generating bogus security associations.
   An optional Key Exchange payload can be exchanged to allow for an

   additional Diffie-Hellman exchange and exponentiation per Quick Mode.
   While use of the key exchange payload with Quick Mode is optional it
   MUST be supported.

   Base Quick Mode (without the KE payload) refreshens the keying
   material derived from the exponentiation in phase 1. This does not
   provide PFS.  Using the optional KE payload, an additional
   exponentiation is performed and PFS is provided for the keying
   material. If a KE payload is sent, a Diffie-Hellman group (see
   section 5.7.1 and [Pip96]) MUST be sent as attributes of the SA being
   negotiated.

   Quick Mode is defined as follows:

        Initiator                        Responder
       -----------                      -----------
        HDR*, HASH(1), SA, Ni
          [, KE ] [, IDui, IDur ] -->
                                  <--    HDR*, HASH(2), SA, Nr
                                               [, KE ] [, IDui, IDur ]
        HDR*, HASH(3)             -->

   Where:
      HASH(1) is the prf over the message id (M-ID) from the ISAKMP
   header concatenated with the entire message that follows the hash
   including all payload headers, but excluding any padding added for
   encryption.  HASH(2) is identical to HASH(1) except the initiator's
   nonce-- Ni, minus the payload header-- is added after M-ID but before
   the complete message.  The addition of the nonce to HASH(2) is for a
   liveliness proff. HASH(3)-- for liveliness-- is the prf over the
   value zero represented as a single octet, followed by a concatenation
   of the message id and the two nonces-- the initiator's followed by
   the responder's-- minus the payload header. In other words, the
   hashes for the above exchange are:

      HASH(1) = prf(SKEYID_a, M-ID | SA | Ni [ | KE ] [ | IDui | IDur ])
      HASH(2) = prf(SKEYID_a, M-ID | Ni | SA | Nr [ | KE ] [ | IDui |
   IDur ])
      HASH(3) = prf(SKEYID_a, 0 | M-ID | Ni | Nr)

   If PFS is not needed, and KE payloads are not exchanged, the new
   keying material is defined as KEYMAT = prf(SKEYID_d, protocol | SPI |
   Ni | Nr).

   If PFS is desired and KE payloads were exchanged, the new keying
   material is defined as KEYMAT = prf(SKEYID_d, g(qm)^xy | protocol |
   SPI | Ni | Nr), where g(qm)^xy is the shared secret from the
   ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exchange of this Quick Mode.



Harkins, Carrel                                        	[Page 12]

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 July 1997


   In either case, "protocol" and "SPI" are from the ISAKMP Proposal
   Payload that contained the negotiated Transform.

   A single SA negotiation results in two security assocations-- one
   inbound and one outbound. Different SPIs for each SA (one chosen by
   the initiator, the other by the responder) guarantee a different key
   for each direction.  The SPI chosen by the destination of the SA is
   used to derive KEYMAT for that SA.

   For situations where the amount of keying material desired is greater
   than that supplied by the prf, KEYMAT is expanded by feeding the
   results of the prf back into itself and concatenating results until
   the required keying material has been reached. In other words,

      KEYMAT = K1 | K2 | K3 | ...
      where
        K1 = prf(SKEYID_d, [ g(qm)^xy | ] SPI | Ni | Nr)
        K2 = prf(SKEYID_d, K1 | [ g(qm)^xy | ] SPI | Ni | Nr)
        K3 = prf(SKEYID_d, K2 | [ g(qm)^xy | ] SPI | Ni | Nr)
        etc.

   This keying material (whether with PFS or without, and whether
   derived directly or through concatenation) MUST be used with the
   negotiated SA. It is up to the service to define how keys are derived
   from the keying material.

   In the case of an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exchange in Quick Mode,
   the exponential (g(qm)^xy) is irretreivably removed from the current
   state and SKEYID_e and SKEYID_a (derived from phase 1 negotiation)
   continue to protect and authenticate the ISAKMP SA and SKEYID_d
   continues to be used to derive keys.

   If ISAKMP is acting as a proxy negotiator on behalf of another party
   the identities of the parties MUST be passed as IDui and then IDur.
   Local policy will dictate whether the proposals are acceptible for
   the identities specified.  If IDs are not exchanged, the negotiation
   is assumed to be done on behalf of each ISAKMP peer.  If an ID range
   (see Appendix A of [Pip96]) is not acceptable (for example, the
   specified subnet is too large) a BAD_ID_RANGE notify message followed
   by an acceptible ID range, in an ID payload, MUST be sent.











Harkins, Carrel                                        	[Page 13]

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 July 1997


   Using Quick Mode, multiple SA's and keys can be negotiated with one
   exchange as follows:

        Initiator                        Responder
       -----------                      -----------
        HDR*, HASH(1), SA0, SA1, Ni,
          [, KE ] [, IDui, IDur ] -->
                                  <--    HDR*, HASH(2), SA0, SA1, Nr,
                                            [, KE ] [, IDui, IDur ]
        HDR*, HASH(3)             -->

   The keying material is derived identically as in the case of a single
   SA. In this case (negotiation of two SA payloads) the result would be
   four security associations-- two each way for both SAs.

5.5 New Group Mode

   New Group Mode MUST NOT be used prior to establishment of an ISAKMP
   SA. The description of a new group MUST only follow phase 1
   negotiation.  (It is not a phase 2 exchange, though).

        Initiator                        Responder
       -----------                      -----------
        HDR*, HASH(1), SA        -->
                                 <--     HDR*, HASH(2), SA

   where HASH(1) is the prf output, using SKEYID_a as the key, and the
   message-ID from the ISAKMP header concatenated with the entire SA
   proposal, body and header, as the data; HASH(2) is the prf output,
   using SKEYID_a as the key, and the message-ID from the ISAKMP header
   concatenated with the reply as the data. In other words the hashes
   for the above exchange are:

      HASH(1) = prf(SKEYID_a, M-ID | SA)
      HASH(2) = prf(SKEYID_a, M-ID | SA)

   The proposal will specify the characteristics of the group (see
   appendix A, "Attribute Assigned Numbers"). Group descriptions for
   private Groups MUST be greater than or equal to 2^15.  If the group
   is not acceptable, the responder MUST reply with a Notify payload
   with the message type set to GROUP_NOT_ACCEPTABLE (13).

   ISAKMP implementations MAY require private groups to expire with the
   SA under which they were established.

   Groups may be directly negotiated in the SA proposal with Main Mode.
   To do this the Prime, Generator (using the Generator One attribute
   class from Appendix A), and Group Type are passed as SA attributes

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 July 1997


   (see Appendix A in [MSST96]). Alternately, the nature of the group
   can be hidden using New Group Mode and only the group identifier is
   passed in the clear during phase 1 negotiation.

5.6 ISAKMP Informational Exchanges

   This protocol protects ISAKMP Informational Exchanges when possible.
   Once the ISAKMP security association has been established (and
   SKEYID_e and SKEYID_a have been generated) ISAKMP Information
   Exchanges, when used with this protocol, are as follows:

        Initiator                        Responder
       -----------                      -----------
        HDR*, HASH(1), N/D      -->

   where N/D is either an ISAKMP Notify Payload or an ISAKMP Delete
   Payload and HASH(1) is the prf output, using SKEYID_a as the key, and
   the entire informational payload (either a Notify or Delete) as the
   data. In other words, the hash for the above exchange is:

      HASH(1) = prf(SKEYID_a, M-ID | N/D)

   If the ISAKMP security association has not yet been established at
   the time of the Informational Exchange, the exchange is done in the
   clear without an accompanying HASH payload.

5.7 Oakley Groups

   With ISAKMP/Oakley, the group in which to do the Diffie-Hellman
   exchange is negotiated. The value 0 indicates no group. The values 1
   and 2 indicate the default groups described below. The attribute
   class for "Group" is defined in Appendix A. Other groups are also
   defined in [Orm96]. All values 2^15 and higher are used for private
   group identifiers. For a discussion on the strength of the default
   Oakley groups please see the Security Considerations section below.

5.7.1 First Oakley Default Group

   Oakley implementations MUST support a MODP group with the following
   prime and generator. This group is assigned id 1 (one).

      The prime is: 2^768 - 2 ^704 - 1 + 2^64 * { [2^638 pi] + 149686 }
      Its hexadecimal value is

         FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF C90FDAA2 2168C234 C4C6628B 80DC1CD1
         29024E08 8A67CC74 020BBEA6 3B139B22 514A0879 8E3404DD

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 July 1997


      The generator is: 2.

5.7.2 Second Oakley Group

   ISAKMP/Oakley implementations MUST support a MODP group with the
   following prime and generator. This group is assigned id 2 (two).

   The prime is 2^1024 - 2^960 - 1 + 2^64 * { [2^894 pi] + 129093 }.
   Its hexadecimal value is

      FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF C90FDAA2 2168C234 C4C6628B 80DC1CD1
      29024E08 8A67CC74 020BBEA6 3B139B22 514A0879 8E3404DD

      EE386BFB 5A899FA5 AE9F2411 7C4B1FE6 49286651 ECE65381
      FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF

   The generator is 2 (decimal)

   Other groups can be defined using New Group Mode. These default
   groups were generated by Richard Schroeppel at the University of
   Arizona.  Properties of these primes are described in [Orm96].

5.8 Payload Explosion for Complete a ISAKMP/Oakley Exchange

   This section illustrates how the ISAKMP/Oakley protocol is used to:

      - establish a secure and authenticated channel between ISAKMP
      processes (phase 1); and

      - generate key material for, and negotiate, an IPsec SA (phase 2).

   The key exchange is authenticated over a signed hash as described in
   section 5.1. Once the signature has been verified using the
   authentication algorithm negotiated as part of the ISAKMP SA, the
   shared keys, SKEYID_e and SKEYID_a can be marked as authenticated.
   (For brevity, certificate payloads were not exchanged).

5.8.2 Phase 2 using Quick Mode

     The following payloads are exchanged in the first round of Quick
   Mode with ISAKMP SA negotiation. In this hypothetical exchange, the
   ISAKMP negotiators are proxies for other parties which have requested
   authentication.

5.9 Perfect Forward Secrecy Example
   This protocol can provide PFS of both keys and identities. The
   identies of both the ISAKMP negotiating peer and, if applicable, the
   identities for whom the peers are negotiating can be protected with
   PFS.

   To provide Perfect Forward Secrecy of both keys and all identities,
   two parties would perform the following:
      o A Main Mode Exchange to protect the identities of the ISAKMP
      peers.
        This establishes an ISAKMP SA.
      o A Quick Mode Exchange to negotiate other security protocol
      protection.
        This establishes a SA on each end for this protocol.
      o Delete the ISAKMP SA and its associated state.
   Since the key for use in the non-ISAKMP SA was derived from the
   single ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exchange PFS is preserved.

   To provide Perfect Forward Secrecy of merely the keys of a non-ISAKMP
   security association, it in not necessary to do a phase 1 exchange if
   an ISAKMP SA exists between the two peers. A single Quick Mode in
   which the optional KE payload is passed, and an additional Diffie-
   Hellman exchange is performed, is all that is required. At this point
   the state derived from this Quick Mode must be deleted from the
   ISAKMP SA as described in section 5.4.

6. Implementation Hints

   Using a single ISAKMP Phase 1 negotiation makes subsequent Phase 2
   negotiations extremely quick.  As long as the Phase 1 state remains
   cached, and PFS is not needed, Phase 2 can proceed without any
   exponentiation. How many Phase 2 negotiations can be performed for a
   single Phase 1 is a local policy issue. The decision will depend on
   the strength of the algorithms being used and level of trust in the
   peer system.

   An implementation may wish to negotiate a range of SAs when
   performing Quick Mode.  By doing this they can speed up the "re-
   keying". Quick Mode defines how KEYMAT is defined for a range of SAs.
   When one peer feels it is time to change SAs they simply use the next
   one within the stated range. A range of SAs can be established by
   negotiating multiple SAs (identical attributes, different SPIs) with
   one Quick Mode.

   An optimization that is often useful is to establish Security
   Associations with peers before they are needed so that when they
   become needed they are already in place. This ensures there would be
   no delays due to key management before initial data transmission.
   This optimization is easily implemented by setting up more than one
   Security Association with a peer for each requested Security
   Association and caching those not immediately used.

   Also, if an ISAKMP implementation is alerted that a SA will soon be
   needed (e.g. to replace an existing SA that will expire in the near
   future), then it can establish the new SA before that new SA is
   needed.

   The base ISAKMP specification describes conditions in which one party
   of the protocol may inform the other party of some activity-- either
   deletion of a security association or in response to some error in
   the protocol such as a signature verification failed or a payload
   failed to decrypt. It is strongly suggested that these Informational
   exchanges not be responded to under any circumstances. Such a
   condition may result in a "notify war" in which failure to understand
   a message results in a notify to the peer who cannot understand it
   and sends his own notify back which is also not understood.

7. Security Considerations

   This entire draft discusses a hybrid protocol, combining Oakley with
   ISAKMP, to negotiate, and derive keying material for, security
   associations in a secure and authenticated manner.

   Confidentiality is assured by the use of a negotiated encryption



Harkins, Carrel                                        	[Page 21]

INTERNET DRAFT                                                 July 1997


   algorithm.  Authentication is assured by the use of a negotiated
   method: a digital signature algorithm; a public key algorithm which
   supports encryption; or, a pre-shared key. The confidentiality and
   authentication of this exchange is only as good as the attributes
   negotiated as part of the ISAKMP security association.

   Repeated re-keying using Quick Mode can consume the entropy of the
   Diffie- Hellman shared secret. Implementors should take note of this
   fact and set a limit on Quick Mode Exchanges between exponentiations.
   This draft does not prescribe such a limit.

   Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) of both keying material and identities
   is possible with this protocol. By specifying a Diffie-Hellman group,
   and passing public values in KE payloads, ISAKMP peers can establish
   PFS of keys-- the identities would be protected by SKEYID_e from the
   ISAKMP SA and would therefore not be protected by PFS. If PFS of both
   keying material and identities is desired, an ISAKMP peer MUST
   establish only one non-ISAKMP security association (e.g. IPsec
   Security Association) per ISAKMP SA. PFS for keys and identities is
   accomplished by deleting the ISAKMP SA (and optionally issuing a
   DELETE message) upon establishment of the single non-ISAKMP SA. In
   this way a phase one negotiation is uniquely tied to a single phase
   two negotiation, and the ISAKMP SA established during phase one
   negotiation is never used again.

   The strength of a key derived from a MODP Diffie-Hellman exchange
   depends on the size of the prime used and also the inherent strength
   of the group. The first default Oakley group for Diffie-Hellman
   exchanges defined in this document provides enough strength for DES--
   56 bits-- with an exponent no less than 160 bits. The second default
   Oakley group for Diffie-Hellman exchanges defined in this document
   provides around 80 bits of strength with an exponent no less than 160
   bits. Implementations should make note of these conservative
   estimates when establishing policy and negotiating security
   parameters.

   Note that these limitations are on the Diffie-Hellman groups
   themselves.  There is nothing in ISAKMP/Oakley which prohibits using
   stronger groups nor is there anything which will dilute the strength
   obtained from stronger groups. In fact, the extensible framework of
   ISAKMP/Oakley encourages the definition of more groups; use of
   elliptical curve groups will greatly increase strength using much
   smaller numbers. At the time of this writing there were no Elliptical
   Curve groups to use with ISAKMP/Oakley.

   For situations where defined groups provide insufficient strength New
   Group Mode can be used to exchange a Diffie-Hellman group which
   provides the necessary strength. In is incumbent upon implementations



Harkins, Carrel                                        	[Page 22]

   to check the primality in groups being offered and independently
   arrive at strength estimates.

   It is assumed that the Diffie-Hellman exponents in this exchange are
   erased from memory after use. In particular, these exponents must not
   be derived from long-lived secrets like the seed to a pseudo-random
   generator.

   Attribute Assigned Numbers

   Attributes negotiated during phase one use the following definitions.
   Phase two attributes are defined in the applicable DOI specification
   (for example, IPsec attributes are defined in the IPsec DOI), with
   the exception of a group description when Quick Mode includes an
   ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exchange.  Attribute types can be either
   Basic (B) or Variable-length (V). Encoding of these attributes is
   defined in the base ISAKMP specification.

Appendix B

   This appendix describes encryption details to be used ONLY when
   encrypting ISAKMP messages.  When a service (such as an IPSEC
   transform) utilizes ISAKMP to generate keying material, all
   encryption algorithm specific details (such as key and IV generation,
   padding, etc...) MUST be defined by that service.  ISAKMP does not
   purport to ever produce keys that are suitable for any encryption
   algorithm.  ISAKMP produces the requested amount of keying material
   from which the service MUST generate a suitable key.  Details, such
   as weak key checks, are the responsibility of the service.

   Use of negotiated PRFs may require the PRF output to be expanded. For
   instance, 3DES-CBC-MAC produces 8 bytes of output which must be used
   as a key to another 3DES-CBC-MAC function call. The output of a PRF
   is expanded by feeding back the results of the PRF into itself to
   generate successive blocks. These blocks are concatenated until the
   requisite number of bytes has been acheived. For example, for pre-
   shared key authentication with 3DES-CBC-MAC as the negotiated PRF:

     BLOCK1-8 = prf(pre-shared-key, Ni | Nr)
     BLOCK9-16 = prf(pre-shared-key, BLOCK1-8 | Ni | Nr)
     BLOCK17-24 = prf(pre-shared-key, BLOCK9-16 | Ni | Nr)
   and
     SKEYID = BLOCK1-8 | BLOCK9-16 | BLOCK17-24

   so therefore to derive SKEYID_d:

     BLOCK1-8 = prf(SKEYID, g^xy | CKY-I | CKY-R)
     BLOCK9-16 = prf(SKEYID, BLOCK1-8 | g^xy | CKY-I | CKY-R)
     BLOCK17-24 = prf(SKEYID, BLOCK9-16 | g^xy | CKY-I | CKY-R)
   and
     SKEYID_d = BLOCK1-8 | BLOCK9-16 | BLOCK17-24

   Subsequent PRF derivations are done similarly.

   Encryption keys used to protect the ISAKMP SA are derived from
   SKEYID_e in an algorithm-specific manner. When SKEYID_e is not long
   enough to supply all the necessary keying material an algorithm
   requires, the key is derived from feeding the results of a pseudo-
   random function into itself, concatenating the results, and taking
   the highest necessary bits.

   For example, if (ficticious) algorithm AKULA requires 320-bits of key
   (and has no weak key check) and the prf used to generate SKEYID_e
   only generates 120 bits of material, the key for AKULA, would be the
   first 320-bits of Ka, where:

       Ka = K1 | K2 | K3
   and
       K1 = prf(SKEYID_e, 0)
       K2 = prf(SKEYID_e, K1)
       K3 = prf(SKEYID_e, K2)

   where prf is the HMAC version of the negotiated hash function or the
   negotiated prf. and 0 is represented by a single octet. Each result
   of the prf provides 120 bits of material for a total of 360 bits.
   AKULA would use the first 320 bits of that 360 bit string.

   In phase 1, material for the initialization vector (IV material) for
   CBC mode encryption algorithms is derived from a hash of a
   concatenation of the initiator's public Diffie-Hellman value and the
   responder's public Diffie-Hellman value using the negotiated hash
   algorithm. This is used for the first message only. Each message
   should be padded up to the nearest block size using bytes containing
   0x00. The message length in the header MUST include the length of the
   pad since this reflects the size of the cyphertext. Subsequent
   messages MUST use the last CBC encryption block from the previous
   message as their initialization vector.

   In phase 2, material for the initialization vector for CBC mode
   encryption of the first message of a Quick Mode exchange is derived
   from a hash of a concatenation of the last phase 1 CBC output block
   and the phase 2 message id using the negotiated hash algorithm. The
   IV for subsequent messages within a Quick Mode exchange is the CBC
   output block from the previous message. Padding and IVs for
   subsequent messages are done as in phase 1.

   Note that the final phase 1 CBC output block, the result of
   encryption/decryption of the last phase 1 message, must be retained
   in the ISAKMP SA state to allow for generation of unique IVs for each
   Quick Mode. Each phase 2 exchange generates IVs independantly to
   prevent IVs from getting out of sync when two different Quick Modes
   are started simultaneously.

   The key for DES-CBC is derived from the first eight (8) non-weak and
   non-semi-weak (see Appendix A) bytes of SKEYID_e. The IV is the first
   8 bytes of the IV material derived above.

   The key for IDEA-CBC is derived from the first sixteen (16) bytes of
   SKEYID_e.  The IV is the first eight (8) bytes of the IV material
   derived above.

   The key for Blowfish-CBC is either the negotiated key size, or the
   first fifty-six (56) bytes of a key (if no key size is negotiated)
   derived in the aforementioned pseudo-random function feedback method.

   The IV is the first eight (8) bytes of the IV material derived above.

   The key for RC5-R16-B64-CBC is the negotiated key length, or the
   first sixteen (16) bytes of a key (if no key size is negotiated)
   derived from the aforementioned pseudo-random function feedback
   method if necessary. The IV is the first eight (8) bytes of the IV
   material derived above. The number of rounds MUST be 16 and the block
   size MUST be 64.

   The key for 3DES-CBC is the first twenty-four (24) bytes of a key
   derived in the aforementioned pseudo-random function feedback method.
   3DES-CBC is an encrypt-decrypt-encrypt operation using the first,
   middle, and last eight (8) bytes of the entire 3DES-CBC key.  The IV
   is the first eight (8) bytes of the IV material derived above.

   The key for CAST-CBC is either the negotiated key size, or the first
   sixteen (16) bytes of a key derived in the aforementioned pseudo-
   random function feedback method.  The IV is the first eight (8) bytes
   of the IV material derived above.

   Support for algorithms other than DES-CBC is purely optional. Some
   optional algorithms may be subject to intellectual property claims.
