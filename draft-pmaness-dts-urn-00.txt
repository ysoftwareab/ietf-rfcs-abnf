1. Introduction

   The DTS audio formats are used in a wide variety of entertainment
   media formats.

   DTS audio emerged in physical media, originating with Laser Disc in
   1996 and is a widely used audio format used in Blu-ray discs today.
   The next generation of entertainment media formats is now emerging
   in the form of downloadable files and streamed media, including the
   Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem (UltraViolet) and other
   digital delivery ecosystems currently in development.

   DTS audio formats are supported in many broadcast standards,
   including DVB, ATSC, SCTE, OIPF, HbbTV and the Korean TTA
   specifications and are defined for both OTT and broadcast delivery
   in many of these specifications.

2. Specifications Template

   Namespace ID:

         "dts"

   Registration information:

      Registration Version Number: 1

      Registration Date: 2014-02-14

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Name:       DTS, Inc.

      Address:    5220 Las Virgenes Rd

                  Calabasas, California, 91301, USA

   Declaration of structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs assigned by

      DTS, Inc. will have the following hierarchical structure:

         urn:dts:{category}:{string}

      where the "category" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to URN
      syntax requirements ([RFC2141]), and "{string}" is a string that
      confirms to URN syntax requirements ([RFC2141]).

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      none

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      DTS, Inc. shall establish unique identifiers as appropriate.
      Uniqueness is guaranteed as long as the assigned "{category}" is
      never reassigned for other categories.  DTS, Inc. is responsible
      for this.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      DTS, Inc. is committed to maintaining the accessibility and
      persistence of all resources that are officially assigned URNs by
      this organization.  Persistence of identifiers is dependent upon
      suitable delegation at the level of "category"s, and persistence
      of category assignment.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      All the assignments of identifiers are fully controlled and
      managed by DTS, Inc.

   Process of identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The "{category}" is case-insensitive.  Thus, the portion of the
      URN:

         urn:dts:{category}:

      is case-insensitive for matches.  The remainder of the identifier
      shall be considered case-sensitive; hence, URNs are only
      lexically equivalent if they are also lexically identical in the
      remaining {string} field.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

      Validation shall be done by a syntax grammar corresponding to
      each "{category}".

   Scope:

      Global.

3. Example

   The following examples represent hypothetical URNs that could be
   assigned by DTS, Inc.

     urn:dts:dash:MPDparameter:2014

     urn:dts:metadata-example:metaparameter:2014

     urn:dts:profile-example:profileparameter:2015

4. Namespace Considerations

     The objective of this namespace registration is to facilitate
     consistent implementation of DTS across all networked ecosystems.

5. Community Considerations

     The names in this namespace are to be used in any public
     implementations applying DTS specifications or in the transmission
     of DTS bitstreams so anybody can benefit from the officially
     assigned namespace.

     Potential beneficiary communities include:

  a) Implementers of the MPEG DASH specifications using DTS audio.

     Resources that comply with the MPEG DASH specifications (including
     DASH schemas, instance documents that comply with DASH schemas,
     and DASH default Classification Schemes) may, by means of the
     registered namespace, become exposed to the general Internet and
     gain from the interoperability benefits of the Internet at large.

  b) Implementers of other specifications that incorporate components
     of the DTS specifications.

     URNs used to identify DTS components may be used to enable their
     inclusion in, and enhancement of, other specifications while
     maintaining, to a certain degree, interoperability with the DTS
     implementers community.

  c) Implementers of other semantically related specifications that do
     not directly incorporate components of the DTS specifications.

     URNs used to identify components of the DTS specifications, such
     as identifiers of terms within default Classification Schemes, may
     enable interoperation with other semantically determined
     specifications (including present and future metadata/resource
     description and ontology specifications) of relevance to audio
     codec implementation  communities (see a) and b) above).Formal
     Syntax

6. IANA Considerations

   The document includes a URN NID registration that is to be entered
   into the IANA registry of URN NIDs.
