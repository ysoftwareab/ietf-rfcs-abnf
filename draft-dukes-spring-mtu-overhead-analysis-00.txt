1.  Introduction

   This document provides an apples-to-apples comparative analysis of
   MTU overhead in the context of SPRING.

   The first version of this document concentrates on stateless IPv6
   encapsulation within a VPN context.

1.1.  Stateless IPv6 Encapsulation Within a VPN Context

   A VPN context provides routing and forwarding isolation at interface
   granularity on a Provider Edge (PE) node.

   Encapsulation between PE nodes is used to forward traffic between the
   VPN contexts of remote nodes.  Typically, this encapsulation encodes
   the remote node address and VPN context.

   Stateless encapsulation requires no additional state be propagated
   between PE and provider (P) nodes.

1.1.1.  Analysis of MTU overhead

   VXLAN [RFC7348], LISP [RFC6830], GTP and SRv6
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming] encapsulations are
   considered as they provide stateless encapsulation while supporting
   VPN contexts.

   VXLAN, LISP, and GTP encapsulate all add VPN context via UDP.

   o  VXLAN: 56 bytes : IPv6(40) + UDP(8) + VXLAN(8)

   o  LISP: 56 bytes : IPv6(40) + UDP(8) + LISP(8)

   o  GTP: 56 bytes : IPv6(40) + UDP(8) + GTP(8)

   SRv6 encapsulates and includes the VPN context with the destination
   SID.

   o  SRv6: 40 bytes : IPv6(40)

   The SRv6 VPN SID encodes location and VPN context so IPv6
   encapsulation is all that's required for the SRv6 case, i.e. there is
   no Segment Routing Extension Header (SRH)
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] required.

   SRv6 results in a lower overhead than VXLAN, LISP, and GTP for
   stateless encapsulation within a VPN context.
