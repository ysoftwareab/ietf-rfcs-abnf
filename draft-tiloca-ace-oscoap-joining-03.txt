                      Joining OSCORE groups in ACE
                   draft-tiloca-ace-oscoap-joining-03

Abstract

   This document describes a method to join a group where communications
   are based on CoAP and secured with Object Security for Constrained
   RESTful Environments (OSCORE).  The proposed method delegates the
   authentication and authorization of client nodes that join an OSCORE
   group through a Group Manager server.  This approach builds on the
   ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization, and leverages
   protocol-specific profiles of ACE to achieve communication security,
   proof-of-possession and server authentication.

1.  Introduction

   Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE)
   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security] is a method for application-layer
   protection of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252],
   using CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [RFC8152] and
   enabling end-to-end security of CoAP payload and options.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm], OSCORE may be used
   also to protect CoAP group communication over IP multicast [RFC7390].
   This relies on a Group Manager entity, which is responsible for
   managing an OSCORE group, where members exchange CoAP messages
   secured with OSCORE.  In particular, the Group Manager coordinates
   the join process of new group members and can be responsible for
   multiple groups.

   This specification builds on the ACE framework for Authentication and
   Authorization [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz] and defines how a client
   joins an OSCORE group through a resource server acting as Group
   Manager.  The client acting as joining node relies on an Access
   Token, which is bound to a proof-of-possession key and authorizes the
   access to a specific join resource at the Group Manager.  Messages
   exchanged among the participants follow the formats defined in

Internet-Draft         OSCORE group joining in ACE            March 2018


   [I-D.palombini-ace-key-groupcomm] for provisioning keying material in
   group communication scenarios.

   In order to achieve communication security, proof-of-possession and
   server authentication, the client and the Group Manager leverage
   protocol-specific profiles of ACE.  These include
   [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize] and [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile], as
   well as possible forthcoming profiles that comply with the
   requirements in Appendix C of [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in the ACE framework for authentication and authorization
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  Message exchanges are presented as
   RESTful protocol interactions, for which HTTP [RFC7231] provides
   useful terminology.

   The terminology for entities in the considered architecture is
   defined in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] and [I-D.ietf-ace-actors].  In
   particular, this includes Client (C), Resource Server (RS), and
   Authorization Server (AS).

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts
   related to the CoAP protocol described in [RFC7252] [RFC7390].  Note
   that, unless otherwise indicated, the term "endpoint" is used here
   following its OAuth definition, aimed at denoting resources such as
   /token and /introspect at the AS and /authz-info at the RS.  This
   document does not use the CoAP definition of "endpoint", which is "An
   entity participating in the CoAP protocol".

   Readers are expected to be familiar with the terms and concepts for
   protection and processing of CoAP messages through OSCORE
   [I-D.ietf-core-object-security] also in group communication scenarios
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm].

   This document refers also to the following terminology.

   o  Joining node: a network node intending to join an OSCORE group,
      where communication is based on CoAP [RFC7390] and secured with
      OSCORE as described in [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm].

Internet-Draft         OSCORE group joining in ACE            March 2018


   o  Join process: the process through which a joining node becomes a
      member of an OSCORE group.  The join process is enforced and
      assisted by the Group Manager responsible for that group.

   o  Join resource: a resource hosted by the Group Manager, associated
      to an OSCORE group under that Group Manager.  A join resource is
      identifiable with the Group Identifier (Gid) of the respective
      group.  A joining node accesses a join resource to start the join
      process and become a member of that group.

   o  Join endpoint: an endpoint at the Group Manager associated to a
      join resource.

2.  Protocol Overview

   Group communication for CoAP over IP multicast has been enabled in
   [RFC7390] and can be secured with Object Security for Constrained
   RESTful Environments (OSCORE) [I-D.ietf-core-object-security] as
   described in [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm].  A network node
   explicitly joins an OSCORE group, by interacting with the responsible
   Group Manager.  Once registered in the group, the new node can
   securely exchange messages with other group members.

   This specification describes how a network node joins an OSCORE group
   by using the ACE framework for authentication and authorization
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  With reference to the ACE framework and
   the terminology defined in OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749]:

   o  The Group Manager acts as Resource Server (RS), and hosts one join
      resource for each OSCORE group it manages.  Each join resource is
      exported by a distinct join endpoint.  During the join process,
      the Group Manager provides joining nodes with the parameters and
      keying material for taking part to secure communications in the
      group.

   o  The joining node acts as Client (C), and requests to join an
      OSCORE group by accessing the related join endpoint at the Group
      Manager.

   o  The Authorization Server (AS) enables and enforces the authorized
      access of joining nodes to join endpoints at the Group Manager,
      and hence the access to the related OSCORE groups.  Multiple Group
      Managers can be associated to the same AS.  The AS is not
      necessarily expected to release Access Tokens for any other
      purpose than accessing join resources on registered Group
      Managers.  However, the AS may be configured also to release
      Access Tokens for accessing resources at members of OSCORE groups.

Internet-Draft         OSCORE group joining in ACE            March 2018


   All communications between the involved entities rely on the CoAP
   protocol and must be secured.  The joining node and the Group Manager
   leverage protocol-specific profiles of ACE to achieve communication
   security, proof-of-possession and server authentication.  To this
   end, the AS must signal the specific profile to use, consistently
   with requirements and assumptions defined in the ACE framework
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

   Communications between the joining node and the AS (/token endpoint)
   as well as between the Group Manager and the AS (/introspection
   endpoint) can be secured by different means, for instance by means of
   DTLS [RFC6347] or OSCORE [I-D.ietf-core-object-security].  Further
   details on how the AS secures communications (with the joining node
   and the Group Manager) depend on the specifically used profile of
   ACE, and are out of the scope of this specification.

   The following steps are performed for joining an OSCORE group.
   Messages exchanged among the participants follow the formats defined
   in [I-D.palombini-ace-key-groupcomm], and are further specified in
   Section 3 and Section 4 of this document.  The Group Manager acts as
   the Key Distribution Center (KDC) referred in
   [I-D.palombini-ace-key-groupcomm].

   1.  The joining node requests an Access Token from the AS to access a
       join resource on the Group Manager and hence the associated
       OSCORE group (see Section 3).  The response from the AS enables
       the joining node to start a secure channel with the Group
       Manager, if not already established.

   2.  The joining node transfers authentication and authorization
       information to the Group Manager by posting the obtained Access
       Token.  Then, the joining node and the Group Manager have to
       establish a secure channel in case one is not already set up (see
       Section 4).  That is, a joining node must establish a secure
       communication channel with a Group Manager, before joining an
       OSCORE group under that Group Manager for the first time.

   3.  The joining node starts the join process to become a member of
       the OSCORE group, by accessing the related join resource hosted
       by the Group Manager (see Section 4).

   4.  At the end of the join process, the joining node has received
       from the Group Manager the parameters and keying material to
       securely communicate in the OSCORE group.

3.  Joining Node to Authorization Server

   This section considers a joining node that intends to contact the
   Group Manager for the first time.  That is, the joining node has
   never attempted before to join an OSCORE group under that Group
   Manager.  Also, the joining node and the Group Manager do not have a
   secure communication channel established.

   In case the specific AS associated to the Group Manager is unknown to
   the joining node, the latter can rely on mechanisms like the
   Unauthorized Resource Request message described in Section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize] to discover the correct AS in charge of
   the Group Manager.  As an alternative, the joining node may look up
   in a Resource Directory service [I-D.ietf-core-resource-directory].

3.1.  Authorization Request

   The joining node contacts the AS, in order to request an Access Token
   for accessing the join resource hosted by the Group Manager and
   associated to the OSCORE group.  The Access Token request sent to the
   /token endpoint follows the format of the Authorization Request
   message defined in Section 3.1 of [I-D.palombini-ace-key-groupcomm].
   In particular:

   o  The "scope" parameter MUST be present and includes:

      *  in the first element, the Group Identifier (Gid) of the group
         to join under the Group Manager.  This identifier may not fully
         coincide with the Gid currently associated to the respective
         group, e.g. if it includes a dynamic component.

      *  in the second element, which MUST be present, the role(s) that
         the joining node intends to have in the group it intends to
         join.  Roles and their combinations are defined in
         [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm], and indicated as
         "multicaster", "listener" and "purelistener".  Multiple roles
         are specified in the form of a CBOR array.

   o  The "aud" parameter MUST be present and is set to the address of
      the Group Manager.

   o  The "get_pub_keys" parameter is present only if the Group Manager
      is configured to store the public keys of the group members and,
      at the same time, the joining node wants to retrieve such public
      keys during the joining process (see Section 5).  In any other
      case, this parameter MUST NOT be present.

3.2.  Authorization Response

   The AS is responsible for authorizing the joining node, accordingly
   to group join policies enforced on behalf of the Group Manager.  In
   case of successful authorization, the AS releases an Access Token
   bound to a proof-of-possession key associated to the joining node.

   Then, the AS provides the joining node with the Access Token as part
   of an Access Token response, which follows the format of the
   Authorization Response message defined in Section 3.2 of
   [I-D.palombini-ace-key-groupcomm].

   The "exp" parameter MUST be present, since defining the lifetime of
   Access Tokens is out of the scope of this specification.

   In case the value of "scope" specified in the Access Token differs
   from the value originally included in the Access Token request, the
   Access Token response MUST include the "scope" parameter, whose
   second element MUST be present and includes the role(s) that the
   joining node is actually authorized to take in the group, encoded as
   specified in Section 3.1 of this document.

   Also, the "profile" parameter indicates the specific profile of ACE
   to use for securing communications between the joining node and the
   Group Manager (see Section 5.6.4.4 of [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]).

   In particular, if symmetric keys are used, the AS generates a proof-
   of-possession key, binds it to the Access Token, and provides it to
   the joining node in the "cnf" parameter of the Access Token response.
   Instead, if asymmetric keys are used, the joining node provides its
   own public key to the AS in the "cnf" parameter of the Access Token
   request.  Then, the AS uses it as proof-of-possession key bound to
   the Access Token, and provides the joining node with the Group
   Manager's public key in the "rs_cnf" parameter of the Access Token
   response.

4.  Joining Node to Group Manager

   First, the joining node posts the Access Token to the /authz-info
   endpoint at the Group Manager, in accordance with the Token post
   defined in Section 3.3 of [I-D.palombini-ace-key-groupcomm].  Then,
   the joining node establishes a secure channel with the Group Manager,
   according to what specified in the Access Token response and to the
   signalled profile of ACE.

Internet-Draft         OSCORE group joining in ACE            March 2018


4.1.  Join Request

   Once a secure communication channel with the Group Manager has been
   established, the joining node requests to join the OSCORE group, by
   accessing the related join resource at the Group Manager.

   In particular, the joining node sends to the Group Manager a
   confirmable CoAP request, using the method POST and targeting the
   join endpoint associated to that group.  This join request follows
   the format of the Key Distribution Request message defined in
   Section 4.1 of [I-D.palombini-ace-key-groupcomm].  In particular:

   o  The "get_pub_keys" parameter can be present only if included also
      in the Authorization Request previously sent to the AS.  In such a
      case, its value is the same as in the Authorization Request.
      Otherwise, this parameter MUST NOT be present.

   o  The "client_cred" parameter, if present, includes the public key
      or certificate of the joining node.  Specifically, it includes the
      public key of the joining node if the Group Manager is configured
      to store the public keys of the group members, or the certificate
      of the joining node otherwise.  This parameter MAY be omitted if:
      i) public keys are used as proof-of-possession keys between the
      joining node and the Group Manager; or ii) the joining node is
      asking to access the group exclusively as pure listener; or iii)
      the Group Manager already acquired this information during a
      previous join process.  In any other case, this parameter MUST be
      present.

   o  The "pub_keys_repos" parameter MAY be present if the "client_cred"
      parameter is both present and with value a certificate of the
      joining node.  If present, this parameter contains the list of
      public key repositories storing the certificate of the joining
      node.  In any other case, this parameter MUST NOT be present.

4.2.  Join Response

   The Group Manager processes the request according to
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].  If this yields to a positive outcome,
   the Group Manager updates the group membership by registering the
   joining node as a new member of the OSCORE group.

   Then, the Group Manager replies to the joining node providing the
   information necessary to participate in the group communication.
   This join response follows the format of the Key Distribution success
   Response message defined in Section 4.2 of
   [I-D.palombini-ace-key-groupcomm].  In particular:

Internet-Draft         OSCORE group joining in ACE            March 2018


   o  The "key" parameter includes what the joining node needs in order
      to set up the OSCORE Security Context as in Section 2 of
      [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm].  In particular:

      *  The "kty" parameter has value "Symmetric".

      *  The "k" parameter includes the OSCORE Master Secret.

      *  The "alg" parameter, if present, has as value the AEAD
         algorithm used in the group.

      *  The "kid" parameter, if present, has as value the identifier of
         the key in the parameter "k".

      *  The "base IV" parameter, if present, has as value the OSCORE
         Common IV.

      *  The "clientID" parameter MUST be present and has as value the
         OSCORE Endpoint ID assigned to the joining node by the Group
         Manager.

      *  The "serverID" parameter MUST be present and has as value the
         Group Identifier (Gid) currently associated to the group.

      *  The "kdf" parameter, if present, has as value the KDF algorithm
         used in the group.

      *  The "slt" parameter, if present, has as value the OSCORE Master
         Salt.

      *  The "cs_alg" parameter MUST be present and has as value the
         countersignature algorithm used in the group.

   o  The "pub_keys" parameter is present only if the "get_pub_keys"
      parameter was present in the join request.  If present, this
      parameter includes the public keys of the group members that are
      relevant to the joining node.  That is, it includes: i) the public
      keys of the non-pure listeners currently in the group, in case the
      joining node is configured (also) as multicaster; and ii) the
      public keys of the multicasters currently in the group, in case
      the joining node is configured (also) as listener or pure
      listener.

   o  The "group_policies" parameter SHOULD be present and includes a
      list of parameters indicating particular policies enforced in the
      group.  For instance, it can indicate the method to achieve
      synchronization of sequence numbers among group members (see
      Appendix E of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm]), as well as the



Tiloca & Park           Expires September 6, 2018               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         OSCORE group joining in ACE            March 2018


      rekeying protocol used to renew the keying material in the group
      (see Section 2.1 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm]).

   o  The "mgt_key_material" parameter SHOULD be present and includes
      the administrative keying material that the joining node requires
      to participate in the rekeying process led by the Group Manager.
      The exact content and format depend on the specific rekeying
      protocol used in the group.

   Finally, the joining node uses the information received in the join
   response to set up the OSCORE Security Context, as described in
   Section 2 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm].  From then on, the
   joining node can exchange group messages secured with OSCORE as
   described in Section 4 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm].

5.  Public Keys of Joining Nodes

   Source authentication of OSCORE messages exchanged within the group
   is ensured by means of digital counter signatures
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm].  Therefore, group members must be
   able to retrieve each other's public key from a trusted key
   repository, in order to verify the source authenticity of incoming
   group messages.

   Upon joining an OSCORE group, a joining node is expected to make its
   own public key available to the other group members, either through
   the Group Manager or through another trusted, publicly available, key
   repository.  However, this is not required for a node that joins a
   group exclusively as pure listener.

   As also discussed in Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm],
   it is recommended that the Group Manager is configured to store the
   public keys of the group members and to provide them upon request.
   If so, three cases can occur when a new node joins a group.

   o  The Group Manager already acquired the public key of the joining
      node during a previous join process.  In this case, the joining
      node is not required to provide again its own public key to the
      Group Manager.

   o  The joining node and the Group Manager use an asymmetric proof-of-
      possession key to establish a secure communication channel.  In
      this case, the Group Manager stores the proof-of-possession key
      conveyed in the Access Token as the public key of the joining
      node.

   o  The joining node and the Group Manager use a symmetric proof-of-

      this case, upon performing a join process with that Group Manager
      for the first time, the joining node specifies its own public key
      in the "client_cred" parameter of the join request targeting the
      join endpoint (see Section 4.1).

   Before sending the join response, the Group Manager should verify
   that the joining node actually owns the associated private key, for
   instance by performing a proof-of-possession challenge-response,
   whose details are out of the scope of this specification.

   Furthermore, as described in Section 4.1, the joining node may have
   explicitly requested the Group Manager to retrieve the public keys of
   the current group members, i.e. through the "get_pub_keys" parameter
   in the join request.  In this case, the Group Manager includes also
   such public keys in the "pub_keys" parameter of the join response
   (see Section 4.2).

   On the other hand, in case the Group Manager is not configured to
   store public keys of group members, the joining node provides the
   Group Manager with its own certificate in the "client_cred" parameter
   of the join request targeting the join endpoint (see Section 4.1).
   Then, the Group Manager validates and handles the certificate, for
   instance as described in Appendix D.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm].

6.  Security Considerations

   The method described in this document leverages the following
   management aspects related to OSCORE groups and discussed in the
   sections of [I-D.ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm] referred below.

   o  Management of group keying material (Section 2.1).  This includes
      the need to revoke and renew the keying material currently used in
      the OSCORE group, upon changes in the group membership.  In
      particular, renewing the keying material is required upon a new
      node joining the group, in order to preserve backward security.
      That is, the Group Manager should renew the keying material before
      completing the join process and sending a join response.  Such a
      join response provides the joining node with updated the keying
      material just established in the group.  The Group Manager is
      responsible to enforce rekeying policies and accordingly update
      the keying material in the groups of its competence (Section 6).

   o  Synchronization of sequence numbers (Section 5).  This concerns
      how a listener node that has just joined an OSCORE group can
      synchronize with the sequence number of multicasters in the same
      group.

   o  Provisioning and retrieval of public keys (Appendix D.2).  This
      provides guidelines about how to ensure the availability of group
      members' public keys, possibly relying on the Group Manager as
      trusted key repository (Section 6).

   Further security considerations are inherited from the ACE framework
   for Authentication and Authorization [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], as
   well as from the specific profile of ACE signalled by the AS, such as
   [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize] and [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile].

7.  IANA Considerations
