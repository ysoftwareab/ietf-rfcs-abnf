       New Media Control Protocol Above TCP in Transmission Layer 
             draft-wang-tcpm-media-control-layer-02.txt

Abstract

   This document describes a new Media Control Protocol (MCP) above the 
   TCP layer in multimedia transimission network. The MCP have the label
   to show the classification of the data from the appliation layer.It 
   also can identify and label the transimission in wired or wireless 
   mode. These tags can optimize the TCP transimission with different 
   methods.

1.  Introduction

   The TCP/IP is the most famous protocols. It provides the end-to-end
   connectivity in the network. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 
   is one of the core protocols of the Internet protocol suite (IP), and 
   is so common that the entire suite is often called TCP/IP. TCP 
   provides reliable, ordered and error-checked delivery of a stream of 
   octets between programs running on computers connected to a local 
   area network, intranet or the public Internet. It resides at the 
   transport layer.But the TCP is designed for the data transmission 
   in the wired network. The packe loss in the wired network is about 
   10e-6, but in the mobile network is about 10e-3. And the download 
   throughtput has the giant decrease. Especially in the mobile wireless 
   network like LTE/WiMax, once the packet loss happened,the protocol 
   only take it as the congestion and decrease the receiving windows. 
   But in fact the packet loss is caused by the change of the wireless 
   environment.So TCP protocol only itself don't have the great 
   advantages in the wireless environment.

   In this document, a new Media Control Protocol (MCP) above the 
   TCP layer in multimedia transimission network. It combines with the 
   TCP in the transmission layers. The MCP have the label to show the 
   classification of the data from the appliation layer. It also can 
   identify and label the transimission in wired or wireless mode. These
   tags can optimize the TCP transimission with different methods. These
   methods include the TCP-Network Coding(TCP-NC), the new congestion 
   control method et. al.Especially in the wireless network, the MCP/TCP
   can provide the better QoE for the end users.

3.1.  The framework of the MCP 
   
   The MCP protocol is above the TCP protocol.It's not the new 
   indenpend layer,it must work with the TCP protocol. These two 
   protocol works in the transport layer.
   Just as show in Figure 2, it only adds the MCP header from the 
   application layer.This sturcture can guarantee the

	     Figure 3. The MCP header structure

   VER
   
   The ver is the version of the MCP. This is the first version.

   X
   
   The x is the extra with only 1 bit.If it is 1, it means the MCP has
   the extra header between the basic header and the data.

   M
   
   This is the tag to show the end of the data used by application.

   D
   
   This tag has 2 bits and can list 4 types of the data. In the first
   version, we only consider the text data or the media data.

   NET

   The net show the transmission environment in the wired network or the
   wireless network. This can help the TCP protocol optimize the 
   congestion avoidance algorithm. The 0x0 represents wireless network 
   and the 0x1 represents the cable network.

   OPT
   
   The optimization mechanism is the tags of different congestion
   method in TCP transmission.

   EXT 

   The extension is 4 bits for the future use.
