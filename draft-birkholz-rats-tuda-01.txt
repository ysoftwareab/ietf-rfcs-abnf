                 Time-Based Uni-Directional Attestation
                      draft-birkholz-rats-tuda-01

Abstract

   This documents defines the method and bindings used to conduct Time-
   based Uni-Directional Attestation (TUDA) between two RATS (Remote
   ATtestation procedureS) Principals over the Internet.  TUDA does not
   require a challenge-response handshake and thereby does not rely on
   the conveyance of a nonce to prove freshness of remote attestation
   Evidence.  Conversely, TUDA enables the creation of Secure Audit Logs
   that can constitute Evidence about current and past operational
   states of an Attester.  As a prerequisite for TUDA, every RATS
   Principal requires access to a trusted and synchronized time-source.
   Per default, in TUDA this is a Time Stamp Authority (TSA) issuing
   signed Time Stamp Tokens (TST).

1.  Introduction

   Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) describe the attempt to
   determine and appraise properties, such as integrity and
   trustworthiness, of a communication partner - the Attester - over the
   Internet to another communication parter - the Verifier - without
   direct access.  TUDA uses the architectural constituents of the RATS
   Architecture [I-D.birkholz-rats-architecture] that defines the Roles
   Attester and Verifier in detail.  The RATS Architecture also defines
   Role Messages.  TUDA creates and conveys a specific type of Role
   Message called Evidence, a composition of trustwrthiness Claims
   provided by an Attester and consumed by a Verifier (potentially
   relayed by another RATS Role that is a Relying Party).  TUDA - in
   contrast to traditional bi-directional challenge-response protocols

   [I-D.birkholz-rats-reference-interaction-model] - enables a uni-
   directional conveyance of attestation Evidence that allows for
   providing attestation information without solicitation (e.g. as
   beacons or push data via YANG Push [RFC8641], [RFC8640], [RFC8639]).

   As a result, this document introduces the term Forward Authenticity.

   Forward Authenticity (FA):  A property of secure communication
      protocols, in which later compromise of the long-term keys of a
      data origin does not compromise past authentication of data from
      that origin.  FA is achieved by timely recording of assessments of
      the authenticity from system components (via "audit logs" during
      "audit sessions") that are authorized for this purpose and
      trustworthy (e.g via endorsed roots of trust), in a time frame
      much shorter than that expected for the compromise of the long-
      term keys.

      Forward Authenticity enables new levels of assurance and can be
      included in basically every protocol, such as ssh, YANG Push,
      router advertisements, link layer neighbor discovery, or even ICMP
      echo.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Evidence

   Remote attestation Evidence is basically a set of trustworthiness
   claims (assertions about the Attester and its system characteristics
   including security posture and protection characteristics) that are
   accompanied by a proof of their veracity - typically a signature
   based on shielded, private and potentially restricted key material.
   As key material alone is typically not self-descriptive with respect
   to its intended use (its semantics), the remote attestation Evidence
   created via TUDA is accompanied by two kinds of certificates that are
   cryptographically associated with a Trust Anchor (TA) [RFC4949] via a
   certification path:

   o  an Attestation Key (AK) Certificate (AK-Cert) that represents the
      attestation provenance of the created Evidence, and






Fuchs, et al.            Expires March 15, 2020                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                    September 2019


   o  an Endorsement Key (EK) Certificate (EK-Cert) that represents the
      protection characteristics of the system components the AK is
      stored in.

   If a Verifier decides to trust both the TA of an AK-Cert and an EK-
   Cert presented by an Attester - and the included assertions about the
   system characteristics describing the Attester, the attestation
   Evidence created via TUDA by the Attester is considered believable.
   Ultimately, believable Evidence is appraised by a Verifier in order
   to assess the trustworthiness of the corresponding Attester.

1.3.  Creating Evidence about Software Component Integrity

   The TUDA protocol mechanism uses hash values of all started software
   components as a basis to provide and create Evidence about the
   integrity of the software components of an Attester.  This section
   defines the processed data items, the required system components, and
   corresponding operations to enable the creation of Evidence about
   software component integrity for TUDA.

1.3.1.  Data Items

   The hash value of a software component created before it is executed
   is referred to as a "measurement" in the remainder of this document.
   Measurements are chained using a rolling hash function.  Each
   measurement added to the sequence of all measurements results in a
   new current hash value that is referred to as a "digest" in the
   remainder of this document.

1.3.2.  System Components

   The function to store these measurements via a rolling hash function
   is provided by a root of trust for storage - a system component that
   MUST be a component of the attester.

   With respect to the boot sequence of an Attester, the very first
   measurements of software components (e.g. the BIOS, or a sometimes a
   bootloader) have to be conducted by a root of trust for measurement
   that is implemented in hardware and MUST be a system component of the
   Attester.

   All measurements retained in the root of trust for measurements are
   handed over to the root of trust for storage when it becomes
   available during the boot procedure of the Attester.  During that
   hand-over the sequence of measurements retained in the root of trust
   for measurement are processed by the rolling hash function of the
   root of trust for storage.

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                    September 2019


   The function of retrieving the current output value of the rolling
   hash function, including a signature to provide a proof of veracity,
   is provided by a root of trust for reporting and MUST be a system
   component of the Attester.

   Typically, a root of trust for storage and a root of trust for
   reporting are tightly coupled.  Analogously, a root of trust for
   measurement is typically independent from the root of trust for
   storage, but has to be able to interact with root of trust for
   storage at some point of the boot sequence of the Attester to hand
   over the retained measurements.

1.3.3.  Operations

   The operation of processing a measurement and adding it to the
   sequence of measurements via the rolling hash function is called
   "extend" and is provided by the root of trust for storage.

   The operation of retrieving the current available hash value that is
   the result of the rolling hash function including a signature based
   on an Attestation Key is called "quote" and is provided by the
   corresponding root of trust for reporting.

1.4.  Remote Attestation Principles

   In essence, RATS are composed of three base activities.  The
   following definitions are derived from the definitions presented in
   [PRIRA] and [TCGGLOSS], and are a simplified summary of the RATS
   Architecture relevant for TUDA.  The complete RATS Architecture and
   every corresponding constituent, message and interaction is defined
   in [I-D.birkholz-rats-architecture].

   Attestation:  The creation of one ore more claims about the
      trustworthiness properties of an Attester, such that the claims
      can be used as Evidence.

   Conveyance:  The transfer of Evidence from the Attester to the
      Verifier via an interconnect.

   Verification:  The appraisal of Evidence by evaluating it against
      known-good-values (a type of declarative guidance).

   With TUDA, the claims that compose the evidence are signatures over
   trustworthy integrity measurements created by leveraging roots of
   trust.  The evidence is appraised via corresponding signatures over
   reference integrity measurements (RIM, represented, for example via
   [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid]).




Fuchs, et al.            Expires March 15, 2020                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                    September 2019


   Protocols that facilitate Trust-Anchor based signatures in order to
   provide RATS are usually bi-directional challenge/response protocols,
   such as the Platform Trust Service protocol [PTS] or CAVES [PRIRA],
   where one entity sends a challenge that is included inside the
   response to prove the recentness - the freshness (see fresh in
   [RFC4949]) - of the attestation information.  The corresponding
   interaction model tightly couples the three activities of creating,
   transferring and appraising evidence.

   The Time-Based Uni-directional Attestation family of protocols - TUDA
   - described in this document can decouple the three activities RATS
   are composed of.  As a result, TUDA provides additional capabilities,
   such as:

   o  remote attestation for Attesters that might not always be able to
      reach the Internet by enabling the verification of past states,

   o  secure audit logs by combining the evidence created via TUDA with
      integrity measurement logs that represent a detailed record of
      corresponding past states,

   o  an uni-directional interaction model that can traverse "diode-
      like" network security functions (NSF) or can be leveraged in
      RESTful architectures (e.g.  CoAP [RFC7252]), analogously.

1.5.  System Component Requirements

   TUDA is a family of protocols that bundles results from specific
   attestation activities.  The attestation activities of TUDA are based
   on a hardware roots of trust that provides the following
   capabilities:

   o  Platform Configuration Registers (PCR) that can extend
      measurements consecutively and represent the sequence of
      measurements as a single digest,

   o  Restricted Signing Keys (RSK) that can only be accessed, if a
      specific signature about a set of measurements can be provided as
      authentication, and

   o  a dedicated source of (relative) time, e.g. a tick counter (a tick
      being a specific time interval, for example 10 ms).

1.6.  Evidence Appraisal

   To appraise the evidence created by an Attester, the Verifier
   requires corresponding Reference Integrity Measurements (RIM).
   Typical set of RIMs are required to assess the integrity of an



Fuchs, et al.            Expires March 15, 2020                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                    September 2019


   Attester.  These sets are called RIM Bundles.  The scope of a RIM
   Bundle encompasses, e.g., a platform, a device, a computing context,
   or a virtualised function.  In order to be comparable, the hashing
   algorithms used by the Attester to create the integrity measurements
   have to match the hashing algorithms used to create the corresponding
   RIM that are used by the Verifier to appraise the attestation
   Evidence about software component integrity.

1.7.  Activities and Actions

   Depending on the platform (i.e. one or more computing contexts
   including a dedicated hardware RoT), a generic RA activity results in
   platform-specific actions that have to be conducted.  In consequence,
   there are multiple specific operations and data models (defining the
   input and output of operations).  Hence, specific actions are are not
   covered by this document.  Instead, the requirements on operations
   and the information elements that are the input and output to these
   operations are illustrated using pseudo code in Appendix C and D.

1.8.  Attestation and Verification

   Both the attestation and the verification activity of TUDA also
   require a trusted Time Stamp Authority (TSA) as an additional third
   party next to the Attester and the Verifier.  The protocol uses a
   Time Stamp Authority based on [RFC3161].  The combination of the
   local source of time provided by the hardware RoT (located on the
   Attester) and the Time Stamp Tokens provided by the TSA (to both the
   Attester and the Verifier) enable the attestation and verification of
   an appropriate freshness of the evidence conveyed by the Attester --
   without requiring a challenge/response interaction model that uses a
   nonce to ensure the freshness.

   Typically, the verification activity requires declarative guidance
   (representing desired or compliant endpoint characteristics in the
   form of RIM, see above) to appraise the individual integrity
   measurements the conveyed evidence is composed on.  The acquisition
   or representation (data models) of declarative guidance as well as
   the corresponding evaluation methods are out of the scope of this
   document.

1.9.  Information Elements and Conveyance

   TUDA defines a set of information elements (IE) that are created and
   stored on the Attester and are intended to be transferred to the
   Verifier in order to enable appraisal.  Each TUDA IE:

   o  is encoded in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR
      [RFC7049]) to minimize the volume of data in motion.  In this

      document, the composition of the CBOR data items that represent IE
      is described using the Concise Data Definition Language, CDDL
      [RFC8610]

   o  that requires a certain freshness is only created/updated when
      out-dated, which reduces the overall resources required from the
      Attester, including the utilization of the hardware root of trust.
      The IE that have to be created are determined by their age or by
      specific state changes on the Attester (e.g. state changes due to
      a reboot-cycle)

   o  is only transferred when required, which reduces the amount of
      data in motion necessary to conduct remote attestation
      significantly.  Only IE that have changed since their last
      conveyance have to be transferred

   o  that requires a certain freshness can be reused for multiple
      remote attestation procedures in the limits of its corresponding
      freshness-window, further reducing the load imposed on the
      Attester and its corresponding hardware RoT.

1.10.  TUDA Objectives

   The Time-Based Uni-directional Attestation family of protocols is
   designed to:

   o  increase the confidence in authentication and authorization
      procedures,

   o  address the requirements of constrained-node networks,

   o  support interaction models that do not maintain connection-state
      over time, such as REST architectures [REST],

   o  be able to leverage existing management interfaces, such as SNMP
      [RFC3411].  RESTCONF [RFC8040] or CoMI [I-D.ietf-core-comi] -- and
      corresponding bindings,

   o  support broadcast and multicast schemes (e.g.  [IEEE1609]),

   o  be able to cope with temporary loss of connectivity, and to

1.11.  Hardware Dependencies

   The binding of the attestation scheme used by TUDA to generate the
   TUDA IE is specific to the methods provided by the hardware RoT used
   (see above).  In this document,expositional text and pseudo-code that
   is provided as a reference to instantiate the TUDA IE is based on TPM
   1.2 and TPM 2.0 operations.  The corresponding TPM commands are
   specified in [TPM12] and [TPM2].  The references to TPM commands and
   corresponding pseudo-code only serve as guidance to enable a better
   understanding of the attestation scheme and is intended to encourage
   the use of any appropriate hardware RoT or equivalent set of
   functions available to a CPU or Trusted Execution Environment [TEE].

2.  TUDA Core Concept

   There are significant differences between conventional bi-directional
   attestation and TUDA regarding both the information elements conveyed
   between Attester and Verifier and the time-frame, in which an
   attestation can be considered to be fresh (and therefore
   trustworthy).

   In general, remote attestation using a bi-directional communication
   scheme includes sending a nonce-challenge within a signed attestation
   token.  Using the TPM 1.2 as an example, a corresponding nonce-
   challenge would be included within the signature created by the
   TPM_Quote command in order to prove the freshness of the attestation
   response, see e.g.  [PTS].

   In contrast, the TUDA protocol uses the combined output of
   TPM_CertifyInfo and TPM_TickStampBlob.  The former provides a proof
   about the platform's state by creating evidence that a certain key is
   bound to that state.  The latter provides proof that the platform was
   in the specified state by using the bound key in a time operation.
   This combination enables a time-based attestation scheme.  The
   approach is based on the concepts introduced in [SCALE] and
   [SFKE2008].

   Each TUDA IE has an individual time-frame, in which it is considered
   to be fresh (and therefore trustworthy).  In consequence, each TUDA
   IE that composes data in motion is based on different methods of
   creation.

   The freshness properties of a challenge-response based protocol
   define the point-of-time of attestation between:

   o  the time of transmission of the nonce, and

   o  the reception of the corresponding response.

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                    September 2019


   Given the time-based attestation scheme, the freshness property of
   TUDA is equivalent to that of bi-directional challenge response
   attestation, if the point-in-time of attestation lies between:

   o  the transmission of a TUDA time-synchronization token, and

   o  the typical round-trip time between the Verifier and the Attester.

   The accuracy of this time-frame is defined by two factors:

   o  the time-synchronization between the Attester and the TSA.  The
      time between the two tickstamps acquired via the hardware RoT
      define the scope of the maximum drift ("left" and "right" in
      respect to the timeline) to the TSA timestamp, and

   o  the drift of clocks included in the hardware RoT.

   Since the conveyance of TUDA evidence does not rely upon a Verifier
   provided value (i.e. the nonce), the security guarantees of the
   protocol only incorporate the TSA and the hardware RoT.  In
   consequence, TUDA evidence can even serve as proof of integrity in
   audit logs with precise point-in-time guarantees, in contrast to
   classical attestations.

3.  Terminology

   This document introduces roles, information elements and types
   required to conduct TUDA and uses terminology (e.g. specific
   certificate names) typically seen in the context of attestation or
   hardware security modules.

3.1.  Universal Terms

   Attestation Identity Key (AIK):  a special purpose signature
      (therefore asymmetric) key that supports identity related
      operations.  The private portion of the key pair is maintained



Fuchs, et al.            Expires March 15, 2020                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                    September 2019


      confidential to the entity via appropriate measures (that have an
      impact on the scope of confidence).  The public portion of the key
      pair may be included in AIK credentials that provide a claim about
      the entity.

   Claim:  A piece of information asserted about a subject [RFC4949].  A
      claim is represented as a name/value pair consisting of a Claim
      Name and a Claim Value [RFC7519].

      In the context of SACM, a claim is also specialized as an
      attribute/value pair that is intended to be related to a statement
      [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology].

   Endpoint Attestation:  the creation of evidence on the Attester that
      provides proof of a set of the endpoints's integrity measurements.
      This is done by digitally signing a set of PCRs using an AIK
      shielded by the hardware RoT.

   Endpoint Characteristics:  the context, composition, configuration,
      state, and behavior of an endpoint.

   Evidence:  a trustworthy set of claims about an endpoint's
      characteristics.

   Identity:  a set of claims that is intended to be related to an
      entity.

   Integrity Measurements:  Metrics of endpoint characteristics (i.e.
      composition, configuration and state) that affect the confidence
      in the trustworthiness of an endpoint.  Digests of integrity
      measurements can be stored in shielded locations (i.e.  PCR of a
      TPM).

   Reference Integrity Measurements:  Signed measurements about the
      characteristics of an endpoint's characteristics that are provided
      by a vendor and are intended to be used as declarative guidance
      [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology] (e.g. a signed CoSWID).

   Trustworthy:  the qualities of an endpoint that guarantee a specific
      behavior and/or endpoint characteristics defined by declarative
      guidance.  Analogously, trustworthiness is the quality of being
      trustworthy with respect to declarative guidance.  Trustworthiness
      is not an absolute property but defined with respect to an entity,
      corresponding declarative guidance, and has a scope of confidence.

      Trustworthy Endpoint: an endpoint that guarantees trustworthy
      behavior and/or composition (with respect to certain declarative
      guidance and a scope of confidence).

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                    September 2019


      Trustworthy Statement: evidence that is trustworthy conveyed by an
      endpoint that is not necessarily trustworthy.

3.2.  Roles

   Attester:  the endpoint that is the subject of the attestation to
      another endpoint.

   Verifier:  the endpoint that consumes the attestation of another
      endpoint to conduct a verification.

   TSA:  a Time Stamp Authority [RFC3161]

3.2.1.  General Types

   Byte:  the now customary synonym for octet

   Cert:  an X.509 certificate represented as a byte-string

3.2.2.  RoT specific terms

   PCR:  a Platform Configuration Register that is part of a hardware
      root of trust and is used to securely store and report
      measurements about security posture

   PCR-Hash:  a hash value of the security posture measurements stored
      in a TPM PCR (e.g. regarding running software instances)
      represented as a byte-string

3.3.  Certificates

   TSA-CA:  the Certificate Authority that provides the certificate for
      the TSA represented as a Cert

   AIK-CA:  the Certificate Authority that provides the certificate for
      the attestation identity key of the TPM.  This is the client
      platform credential for this protocol.  It is a placeholder for a
      specific CA and AIK-Cert is a placeholder for the corresponding
      certificate, depending on what protocol was used.  The specific
      protocols are out of scope for this document, see also
      [AIK-Enrollment] and [IEEE802.1AR].

4.  Time-Based Uni-Directional Attestation

   A Time-Based Uni-Directional Attestation (TUDA) consists of the
   following seven information elements.  They are used to gain
   assurance of the Attester's platform configuration at a certain point
   in time:



Fuchs, et al.            Expires March 15, 2020                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                    September 2019


   TSA Certificate:  The certificate of the Time Stamp Authority that is
      used in a subsequent synchronization protocol token.  This
      certificate is signed by the TSA-CA.

   AIK Certificate:  A certificate about the Attestation Identity Key
      (AIK) used.  This may or may not also be an [IEEE802.1AR] IDevID
      or LDevID, depending on their setting of the corresponding
      identity property.  ([AIK-Credential], [AIK-Enrollment]; see
      Appendix D.2.1.)

   Synchronization Token:  The reference for attestations are the
      relative timestanps provided by the hardware RoT.  In order to put
      attestations into relation with a Real Time Clock (RTC), it is
      necessary to provide a cryptographic synchronization between these
      trusted relative timestamps and the regular RTC that is a hardware
      component of the Attester.  To do so, a synchronization protocol
      is run with a Time Stamp Authority (TSA).

   Restriction Info:  The attestation relies on the capability of the
      hardware RoT to operate on restricted keys.  Whenever the PCR
      values for the machine to be attested change, a new restricted key
      is created that can only be operated as long as the PCRs remain in
      their current state.

      In order to prove to the Verifier that this restricted temporary
      key actually has these properties and also to provide the PCR
      value that it is restricted, the corresponding signing
      capabilities of the hardware RoT are used.  It creates a signed
      certificate using the AIK about the newly created restricted key.

   Measurement Log:  Similarly to regular attestations, the Verifier
      needs a way to reconstruct the PCRs' values in order to estimate
      the trustworthiness of the device.  As such, a list of those
      elements that were extended into the PCRs is reported.  Note
      though that for certain environments, this step may be optional if
      a list of valid PCR configurations (in the form of RIM available
      to the Verifier) exists and no measurement log is required.

   Implicit Attestation:  The actual attestation is then based upon a
      signed timestamp provided by the hardware RoT using the restricted
      temporary key that was certified in the steps above.  The signed
      timestamp provides evidence that at this point in time (with
      respect to the relative time of the hardware RoT) a certain
      configuration existed (namely the PCR values associated with the
      restricted key).  Together with the synchronization token this
      timestamp represented in relative time can then be related to the
      real-time clock.

   Concise SWID tags:  As an option to better assess the trustworthiness
      of an Attester, a Verifier can request the reference hashes (RIM,
      which are often referred to as golden measurements) of all started
      software components to compare them with the entries in the
      measurement log.  References hashes regarding installed (and
      therefore running) software can be provided by the manufacturer
      via SWID tags.  SWID tags are provided by the Attester using the
      Concise SWID representation [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid] and bundled
      into a CBOR array (a RIM Manifest).  Ideally, the reference hashes
      include a signature created by the manufacturer of the software to
      prove their integrity.

   These information elements could be sent en bloc, but it is
   recommended to retrieve them separately to save bandwidth, since
   these elements have different update cycles.  In most cases,
   retransmitting all seven information elements would result in
   unnecessary redundancy.

   Furthermore, in some scenarios it might be feasible not to store all
   elements on the Attester endpoint, but instead they could be
   retrieved from another location or be pre-deployed to the Verifier.
   It is also feasible to only store public keys on the Verifier and
   skip the whole certificate provisioning completely in order to save
   bandwidth and computation time for certificate verification.

4.1.  TUDA Information Elements Update Cycles

   An endpoint can be in various states and have various information
   associated with it during its life cycle.  For TUDA, a subset of the
   states (which can include associated information) that an endpoint
   and its hardware root of trust can be in, is important to the
   attestation process.  States can be:

   o  persistent, even after a hard reboot.  This includes certificates
      that are associated with the endpoint itself or with services it
      relies on.

   o  volatile to a degree, because they change at the beginning of each
      boot cycle.  This includes the capability of a hardware RoT to
      provide relative time which provides the basis for the
      synchronization token and implicit attestation--and which can
      reset after an endpoint is powered off.

   o  very volatile, because they change during an uptime cycle (the
      period of time an endpoint is powered on, starting with its boot).
      This includes the content of PCRs of a hardware RoT and thereby
      also the PCR-restricted signing keys used for attestation.

   Depending on this "lifetime of state", data has to be transported
   over the wire, or not.  E.g. information that does not change due to
   a reboot typically has to be transported only once between the
   Attester and the Verifier.

   There are three kinds of events that require a renewed attestation:

   o  The Attester completes a boot-cycle

   o  A relevant PCR changes

   o  Too much time has passed since the last attestation statement

   The third event listed above is variable per application use case and
   also depends on the precision of the clock included in the hardware
   RoT.  For usage scenarios, in which the device would periodically
   push information to be used in an audit-log, a time-frame of
   approximately one update per minute should be sufficient in most
   cases.  For those usage scenarios, where Verifiers request (pull) a
   fresh attestation statement, an implementation could use the hardware
   RoT continuously to always present the most freshly created results.
   To save some utilization of the hardware RoT for other purposes,
   however, a time-frame of once per ten seconds is recommended, which
   would typically leave about 80% of utilization for other
   applications.

5.  Sync Base Protocol

   The uni-directional approach of TUDA requires evidence on how the TPM
   time represented in ticks (relative time since boot of the TPM)
   relates to the standard time provided by the TSA.  The Sync Base
   Protocol (SBP) creates evidence that binds the TPM tick time to the
   TSA timestamp.  The binding information is used by and conveyed via
   the Sync Token (TUDA IE).  There are three actions required to create
   the content of a Sync Token:

   o  At a given point in time (called "left"), a signed tickstamp
      counter value is acquired from the hardware RoT.  The hash of
      counter and signature is used as a nonce in the request directed
      at the TSA.

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                    September 2019


   o  The corresponding response includes a data-structure incorporating
      the trusted timestamp token and its signature created by the TSA.

   o  At the point-in-time the response arrives (called "right"), a
      signed tickstamp counter value is acquired from the hardware RoT
      again, using a hash of the signed TSA timestamp as a nonce.

   The three time-related values -- the relative timestamps provided by
   the hardware RoT ("left" and "right") and the TSA timestamp -- and
   their corresponding signatures are aggregated in order to create a
   corresponding Sync Token to be used as a TUDA Information Element
   that can be conveyed as evidence to a Verifier.

   The drift of a clock incorporated in the hardware RoT that drives the
   increments of the tick counter constitutes one of the triggers that
   can initiate a TUDA Information Element Update Cycle in respect to
   the freshness of the available Sync Token.

Appendix A.  REST Realization

   Each of the seven data items is defined as a media type (Section 6).
   Representations of resources for each of these media types can be
   retrieved from URIs that are defined by the respective servers
   [RFC7320].  As can be derived from the URI, the actual retrieval is
   via one of the HTTPs ([RFC7230], [RFC7540]) or CoAP [RFC7252].  How a
   client obtains these URIs is dependent on the application; e.g., CoRE
   Web links [RFC6690] can be used to obtain the relevant URIs from the
   self-description of a server, or they could be prescribed by a
   RESTCONF data model [RFC8040].

Appendix B.  SNMP Realization

   SNMPv3 [STD62] [RFC3411] is widely available on computers and also
   constrained devices.  To transport the TUDA information elements, an
   SNMP MIB is defined below which encodes each of the seven TUDA
   information elements into a table.  Each row in a table contains a
   single read-only columnar SNMP object of datatype OCTET-STRING.  The
   values of a set of rows in each table can be concatenated to
   reconstitute a CBOR-encoded TUDA information element.  The Verifier
   can retrieve the values for each CBOR fragment by using SNMP GetNext
   requests to "walk" each table and can decode each of the CBOR-encoded
   data items based on the corresponding CDDL [RFC8610] definition.

   Design Principles:

   1.  Over time, TUDA attestation values age and should no longer be
       used.  Every table in the TUDA MIB has a primary index with the
       value of a separate scalar cycle counter object that
       disambiguates the transition from one attestation cycle to the
       next.

   2.  Over time, the measurement log information (for example) may grow
       large.  Therefore, read-only cycle counter scalar objects in all
       TUDA MIB object groups facilitate more efficient access with SNMP
       GetNext requests.

   3.  Notifications are supported by an SNMP trap definition with all
       of the cycle counters as bindings, to alert a Verifier that a new
       attestation cycle has occurred (e.g., synchronization data,
       measurement log, etc. have been updated by adding new rows and
       possibly deleting old rows).

B.1.  Structure of TUDA MIB

   The following table summarizes the object groups, tables and their
   indexes, and conformance requirements for the TUDA MIB:

   |-------------|-------|----------|----------|----------|
   | Group/Table | Cycle | Instance | Fragment | Required |
   |-------------|-------|----------|----------|----------|
   | General     |       |          |          | x        |
   | AIKCert     | x     | x        | x        |          |

   | Restrict    | x     |          |          | x        |
   | Measure     | x     | x        |          |          |
   | VerifyToken | x     |          |          | x        |
   | SWIDTag     | x     | x        | x        |          |
   |-------------|-------|----------|----------|----------|

B.1.1.  Cycle Index

   A tudaV1<Group>CycleIndex is the:

   1.  first index of a row (element instance or element fragment) in
       the tudaV1<Group>Table;

   2.  identifier of an update cycle on the table, when rows were added
       and/or deleted from the table (bounded by tudaV1<Group>Cycles);
       and

   3.  binding in the tudaV1TrapV2Cycles notification for directed
       polling.

B.1.2.  Instance Index

   A tudaV1<Group>InstanceIndex is the:

   1.  second index of a row (element instance or element fragment) in
       the tudaV1<Group>Table; except for

   2.  a row in the tudaV1SyncTokenTable (that has only one instance per
       cycle).

B.1.3.  Fragment Index

   A tudaV1<Group>FragmentIndex is the:

   1.  last index of a row (always an element fragment) in the
       tudaV1<Group>Table; and

   2.  accomodation for SNMP transport mapping restrictions for large
       string elements that require fragmentation.

B.2.  Relationship to Host Resources MIB

   The General group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the System group in
   the Host Resources MIB [RFC2790] and provides context information for
   the TUDA attestation process.

   The Verify Token group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Device
   group in the Host MIB and represents the verifiable state of a TPM
   device and its associated system.

   The SWID Tag group (containing a Concise SWID reference hash profile
   [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid]) in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Software
   Installed and Software Running groups in the Host Resources MIB
   [RFC2790].

B.3.  Relationship to Entity MIB

   The General group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Entity General
   group in the Entity MIB v4 [RFC6933] and provides context information
   for the TUDA attestation process.

   The SWID Tag group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the Entity Logical
   group in the Entity MIB v4 [RFC6933].

B.4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The General group in the TUDA MIB is analogous to the System group in
   MIB-II [RFC1213] and the System group in the SNMPv2 MIB [RFC3418] and
   provides context information for the TUDA attestation process.

Appendix D.  Realization with TPM functions

D.1.  TPM Functions

   The following TPM structures, resources and functions are used within
   this approach.  They are based upon the TPM specifications [TPM12]
   and [TPM2].

D.1.1.  Tick-Session and Tick-Stamp

   On every boot, the TPM initializes a new Tick-Session.  Such a tick-
   session consists of a nonce that is randomly created upon each boot
   to identify the current boot-cycle - the phase between boot-time of
   the device and shutdown or power-off - and prevent replaying of old
   tick-session values.  The TPM uses its internal entropy source that
   guarantees virtually no collisions of the nonce values between two of
   such boot cycles.

   It further includes an internal timer that is being initialize to
   Zero on each reboot.  From this point on, the TPM increments this
   timer continuously based upon its internal secure clocking
   information until the device is powered down or set to sleep.  By its
   hardware design, the TPM will detect attacks on any of those
   properties.



Fuchs, et al.            Expires March 15, 2020                [Page 57]

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                    September 2019


   The TPM offers the function TPM_TickStampBlob, which allows the TPM
   to create a signature over the current tick-session and two
   externally provided input values.  These input values are designed to
   serve as a nonce and as payload data to be included in a
   TickStampBlob: TickstampBlob := sig(TPM-key, currentTicks || nonce ||
   externalData).

   As a result, one is able to proof that at a certain point in time
   (relative to the tick-session) after the provisioning of a certain
   nonce, some certain externalData was known and provided to the TPM.
   If an approach however requires no input values or only one input
   value (such as the use in this document) the input values can be set
   to well-known value.  The convention used within TCG specifications
   and within this document is to use twenty bytes of zero
   h'0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' as well-known value.

D.1.2.  Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs)

   The TPM is a secure cryptoprocessor that provides the ability to
   store measurements and metrics about an endpoint's configuration and
   state in a secure, tamper-proof environment.  Each of these security
   relevant metrics can be stored in a volatile Platform Configuration
   Register (PCR) inside the TPM.  These measurements can be conducted
   at any point in time, ranging from an initial BIOS boot-up sequence
   to measurements taken after hundreds of hours of uptime.

   The initial measurement is triggered by the Platforms so-called pre-
   BIOS or ROM-code.  It will conduct a measurement of the first
   loadable pieces of code; i.e.\ the BIOS.  The BIOS will in turn
   measure its Option ROMs and the BootLoader, which measures the OS-
   Kernel, which in turn measures its applications.  This describes a
   so-called measurement chain.  This typically gets recorded in a so-
   called measurement log, such that the values of the PCRs can be
   reconstructed from the individual measurements for validation.

   Via its PCRs, a TPM provides a Root of Trust that can, for example,
   support secure boot or remote attestation.  The attestation of an
   endpoint's identity or security posture is based on the content of an
   TPM's PCRs (platform integrity measurements).

D.1.3.  PCR restricted Keys

   Every key inside the TPM can be restricted in such a way that it can
   only be used if a certain set of PCRs are in a predetermined state.
   For key creation the desired state for PCRs are defined via the
   PCRInfo field inside the keyInfo parameter.  Whenever an operation
   using this key is performed, the TPM first checks whether the PCRs

Internet-Draft                    TUDA                    September 2019


   are in the correct state.  Otherwise the operation is denied by the
   TPM.

D.1.4.  CertifyInfo

   The TPM offers a command to certify the properties of a key by means
   of a signature using another key.  This includes especially the
   keyInfo which in turn includes the PCRInfo information used during
   key creation.  This way, a third party can be assured about the fact

D.2.1.  AIK and AIK Certificate

   Attestations are based upon a cryptographic signature performed by
   the TPM using a so-called Attestation Identity Key (AIK).  An AIK has
   the properties that it cannot be exported from a TPM and is used for
   attestations.  Trust in the AIK is established by an X.509
   Certificate emitted by a Certificate Authority.  The AIK certificate
   is either provided directly or via a so-called PrivacyCA
   [AIK-Enrollment].

   This element consists of the AIK certificate that includes the AIK's
   public key used during verification as well as the certificate chain
   up to the Root CA for validation of the AIK certificate itself.

   TUDA-Cert = [AIK-Cert, TSA-Cert]; maybe split into two for SNMP
   AIK-Cert = Cert
   TSA-Cert = Cert

                    Figure 2: TUDA-Cert element in CDDL

   The TSA-Cert is a standard certificate of the TSA.

   The AIK-Cert may be provisioned in a secure environment using
   standard means or it may follow the PrivacyCA protocols.  Figure 3
   gives a rough sketch of this protocol.  See [AIK-Enrollment] for more
   information.

   The X.509 Certificate is built from the AIK public key and the
   corresponding PKCS #7 certificate chain, as shown in Figure 3.

D.2.2.  Synchronization Token

   The reference for Attestations are the Tick-Sessions of the TPM.  In
   order to put Attestations into relation with a Real Time Clock (RTC),
   it is necessary to provide a cryptographic synchronization between
   the tick session and the RTC.  To do so, a synchronization protocol
   is run with a Time Stamp Authority (TSA) that consists of three
   steps:

   o  The TPM creates a TickStampBlob using the AIK

   o  This TickstampBlob is used as nonce to the Timestamp of the TSA

   o  Another TickStampBlob with the AIK is created using the TSA's
      Timestamp a nonce

   The first TickStampBlob is called "left" and the second "right" in a
   reference to their position on a time-axis.

   These three elements, with the TSA's certificate factored out, form
   the synchronization token

D.2.3.  RestrictionInfo

   The attestation relies on the capability of the TPM to operate on
   restricted keys.  Whenever the PCR values for the machine to be
   attested change, a new restricted key is created that can only be
   operated as long as the PCRs remain in their current state.

   In order to prove to the Verifier that this restricted temporary key
   actually has these properties and also to provide the PCR value that
   it is restricted, the TPM command TPM_CertifyInfo is used.  It
   creates a signed certificate using the AIK about the newly created
   restricted key.

   This token is formed from the list of:

   o  PCR list,

   o  the newly created restricted public key, and

   o  the certificate.

D.2.4.  Measurement Log

   Similarly to regular attestations, the Verifier needs a way to
   reconstruct the PCRs' values in order to estimate the trustworthiness
   of the device.  As such, a list of those elements that were extended
   into the PCRs is reported.  Note though that for certain
   environments, this step may be optional if a list of valid PCR
   configurations exists and no measurement log is required.

D.2.5.  Implicit Attestation

   The actual attestation is then based upon a TickStampBlob using the
   restricted temporary key that was certified in the steps above.  The
   TPM-Tickstamp is executed and thereby provides evidence that at this
   point in time (with respect to the TPM internal tick-session) a
   certain configuration existed (namely the PCR values associated with
   the restricted key).  Together with the synchronization token this
   tick-related timing can then be related to the real-time clock.

   This element consists only of the TPM_TickStampBlock with no nonce.

   internal clock -- a certain configuration of PCRs was present, as
   denoted in the keys restriction information.

D.3.5.  Sync Proof

   In order to proof to the Verifier that the TPM's clock was not 'fast-
   forwarded' the result of a TPM2_GetTime() is sent after the TUDA-
   AttestationToken.

   TUDA-SyncProof = sig(AIK-Key,
                        TimeInfo = [
                          time,
                          resetCount,
                          restartCount
                        ]
                       ),
