2.0 Introduction
   
   This document describes a model for managing Ethernet pseudo wire
   services for transmission over a packet Switched Network (PSN). This
   MIB module is generic and common to all types of PSNs supported in
   the PWE3 Framework [FRMWK], which describes the transport and
   encapsulation of L1 and L2 services over supported PSN types.
   
   This document defines the MIB objects necessary to manage the
   Ethernet service over a PW. In particular, the MIB module associates
   a physical point-to-point service or a virtual point-to-point service
   (VPLS) Ethernet port to a point-to-point VC. It is complementary to
   the [PWMIB], which is used to manage the generic PW parameters common
   to all service, including all supported PSN types.

   
Conventions used in this document
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

3.0 Terminology
   
   This document uses terminology from the document describing the PW
   framework [FRMWK].
   
   Adaptation          Refers to the method of adapting a "foreign"
                       communications protocol such that it can be
                       carried by a packet switched net (the PSN). For
                       example, in a CEM service the foreign protocol
                       is SONET/SDH and the PSN is MPLS.
   
   PSN                         Public Service Network.
   
   PSN Tunnel           A general term indicating a virtual connection
                        between the two PW edge devices. In practice
                        this connection is not limited to path-oriented
                        types of PSNs such as MPLS. An example of a non-
                        path-oriented PSN is an IP PSN.

4.0 The SNMP Management Framework
   
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:
   
   o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].
   
   o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
     purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
     16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215
     [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD
     58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
     2580 [RFC2580].
   
   o Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
     described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the
     SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
     protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901] and
     RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message protocol is
     called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572
     [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].
   
   o Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
     first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
     described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol
     operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
     [RFC1905].
   
   o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573]
     and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
     [RFC2575].
   
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
   
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine-
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

 4.1     Object Definitions
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI. In particular, an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an
   administratively assigned name, names each object type. The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
   the object type.

5.0 Feature Checklist
   
   The PW Ethernet MIB (PW-ENET-MIB) is designed to satisfy the
   following requirements and constraints:
   
    - The MIB is designed to be work with the PW-MIB [PW-MIB].
   
    - The MIB is independent of the PSN type.
   
    - The MIB supports all modes specified for the Ethernet services as
      defined in [ENETPW]. These include port-based, VLAN-based, VLAN
      range service, and VLAN-change services.
   
    - In the case of an MPLS PSN, the MIB support the use of multiple
      VCs to carry the same Ethernet service. These VCs can be used to
      support L-LSPs or single COS E-LSPs capable PSN, when mapping of
      the Ethernet PRI bits to the PSN COS is required.
   
    - The MIB enables both point-to-point Ethernet services and VPLS
      services such as VPLS [VPLS].
   
   
   
6.0 PW-MIB usage
   
   The MIB structure for defining a PW service is composed of three
   layers of MIB modules functioning together. This general model is
   defined in the PWE3 Framework [FRMWK].  The layering model is
   intended to sufficiently isolate PW services from the underlying PSN
   layer that carries the emulated service. This is done at the same
   time as providing a standard means for connecting any supported
   services to any supported PSNs.
   
   The first layer known as the service layer contains service-specific
   modules such as the one defined in this document. These modules
   define service-specific management objects that interface or
   collaborate with existing MIB modules for the native version of the

   service. The service-specific module "glues" the standard module to
   the PWE MIB framework.
   
   The next layer of the PWE MIB framework is comprised of the PW-MIB
   module [PWMIB]. This module is used to configure general parameters
   of PW VCs that are common to all types of emulated services and PSNs.
   This layer is connected to the service-specific layer above, and the
   PSN layer below.
   
   The PSN layer provides PSN-specific modules for each type of PSN.
   These modules associate the VC with one or more "tunnels" that carry
   the service over the PSN. These modules are defined in other
   documents. This module is used to "glue" the PW service to the
   underlying PSN-specific MIB modules. In the case of MPLS, for
   example, the PW-MPLS MIB [PWMPLSMIB] is used to connect the PW
   service to either the MPLS-LDP [LDPMIB] or MPLS-TE [TEMIB] MIBs.
   
   [PWTC] defines some of the object types used in these modules.
   
   The Etherlike-MIB [ENETLIKE] does not support virtual Ethernet port,
   and therefore it is not related directly to this MIB (except that it
   is required to manage the physical Ethernet port that is emulated by
   the PW over the PSN).
   
   
 6.1     PW-ENET-MIB usage
   
    - The VC table (pwVcTable) is used for all VC types (ATM, FR,
      Ethernet, SONET, etc.). This table contains high level generic
      parameters related to the VC creation. A row is created by the
      operator for each PW service.
   
    - Based on the PSN type defined for the VC, rows are created in PSN
      specific module (for example [PWMPLSMIB]) and associated to the
      VC table by a common VC index.

    - If the VC type is Ethernet, EthernetVLAN or EthernetVPLS a row is
      created in pwVcEnetTable.
    
    - When using a MPLS PSN, it may be required to separate the same
      Ethernet services to multiple PW in order to support multiple COS
      on the same service. In this case, multiple VCs, each with the
      appropriate COS will be created to the same destination, and
      classification will be based also on the Ethernet PRI bits
      marking. The MIB allow any combinations of multiple PRI setting
      to PSN COS mapping. The exact PSN marking (EXP bits, DSCP etc.)
      is out of scope of this MIB. In these cases, pwVcEnetTable will
      hold multiple rows with the same Ethernet port and VLAN mapping,
      each VC will need to be created separately by the signaling
      process.

           2) Raw based service (i.e. pwVcType equal 'ethernet')
              in PW-MIB.
   
           It MUST be equal to pwVcEnetPwVlan if 'noChange' mode
           is used.
   
           The value 4096 indicate that no VLAN (i.e. untagged
           frames) on the port are associated to this VC. This
           allows the same behaviors as assigning 'Default VLAN'
           to non tagged frames.
   
           When a VLAN change takes place, the value of the VLAN
           tag on the VC should be set to zero. This will allow the
           PW to preserve the user PRI bits end-to-end. This will
           also facilitate compatibility with the VPLS service
           configuration.

8.0 Security Considerations
   
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.
   
   No managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information.
   
   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.
   
   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.
   
   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
