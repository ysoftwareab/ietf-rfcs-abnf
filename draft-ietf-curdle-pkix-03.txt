1.  Introduction

   In [RFC7748], the elliptic curves Curve25519 and Curve448 are
   described.  They are designed with performance and security in mind.
   The curves may be used for Diffie-Hellman and Digital Signature
   operations.

   [RFC7748] describes the operations on these curves for the Diffie-
   Hellman operation.  A convention has developed that when these two
   curves are used with the Diffie-Hellman operation, they are referred
   to as X25519 and X448.  This RFC defines the ASN.1 Object Identifiers
   (OIDs) for the operations X25519 and X448 along with the parameters.
   The use of these OIDs is described for public and private keys.

   In [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa] the elliptic curve signature system Edwards-
   curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) is described along with a
   recommendation for the use of the Curve25519 and Curve448.  EdDSA has
   defined two modes, the PureEdDSA mode without pre-hashing, and the
   HashEdDSA mode with pre-hashing.  The Ed25519ph and Ed448ph algorithm
   definitions specify the one-way hash function that is used for pre-
   hashing.  The convention used for identifying the algorithm/curve



Josefsson & Schaad        Expires May 27, 2017                  [Page 2]

Internet-Draft            Safe curves for X.509            November 2016


   combinations are to use the Ed25519 and Ed448 for the PureEdDSA mode,
   with Ed25519ph and Ed448ph for the HashEdDSA mode.  The use of the
   OIDs is described for public keys, private keys and signatures.

   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa] additionally defined the concept of a context.
   Contexts can be used to differentiate signatures generated for
   different purposes with the same key.  The use of contexts is not
   defined in this document for the following reasons:

   o  The current implementations of Ed25519 do not support the use of
      contexts, thus if specified it will potentially delay the use of
      these algorithms further.

   o  The EdDSA algorithms are the only IETF algorithms that currently
      support the use of contexts, however there is a possibility that
      there will be confusion between which algorithms need have
      separate keys and which do not.  This may result in a decrease of
      security for those other algorithms.

   o  There are still on going discussions among the cryptographic
      community about how effective the use of contexts is for
      preventing attacks.

   o  There needs to be discussions about the correct way to identify
      when context strings are to be used.  It is not clear if different
      OIDs should be used for different contexts, or the OID should
      merely not that a context string needs to be provided.

2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Curve25519 and Curve448 Algorithm Identifiers

   Certificates conforming to [RFC5280] can convey a public key for any
   public key algorithm.  The certificate indicates the algorithm
   through an algorithm identifier.  This algorithm identifier is an OID
   and optionally associated parameters.

   The AlgorithmIdentifier type, which is included for convenience, is
   defined as follows:

   AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
       algorithm   OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
       parameters  ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL
   }



Josefsson & Schaad        Expires May 27, 2017                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            Safe curves for X.509            November 2016


   The fields in AlgorithmIdentifier have the following meanings:

   o  algorithm identifies the cryptographic algorithm with an object
      identifier.  This is one of the OIDs defined below.

   o  parameters, which are optional, are the associated parameters for
      the algorithm identifier in the algorithm field.  When the 1997
      syntax for AlgorithmIdentifier was initially defined, it omitted
      the OPTIONAL key word.  The optionality of the parameters field
      was later recovered via a defect report, but by then many people
      thought that the field was mandatory.  For this reason, a small
      number of implementations may still require the field to be
      present.

   In this document we defined six new OIDs for identifying the
   different curve/algorithm pairs.  The curves being Curve25519 and
   Curve448.  The algorithms being ECDH, EdDSA in pure mode and EdDSA in
   pre-hash mode.  For all of the OIDs, the parameters MUST be absent.
   Regardless of the defect in the original 1997 syntax, implementations
   MUST NOT accept a parameters value of NULL.

   The same algorithm identifiers are used for identifying a public key,
   identifying a private key and identifying a signature (for the four
   EdDSA related OIDs).  Additional encoding information is provided
   below for each of these locations.

   id-X25519    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 110 }
   id-X448      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 111 }
   id-Ed25519   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 112 }
   id-Ed448     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 113 }
   id-Ed25519ph OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 114 }
   id-Ed448ph   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 3 101 115 }

4.  Subject Public Key Fields

   In the X.509 certificate, the subjectPublicKeyInfo field has the
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo type, which has the following ASN.1 syntax:

   SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
       algorithm         AlgorithmIdentifier,
       subjectPublicKey  BIT STRING
   }

   The fields in SubjectPublicKeyInfo have the following meanings:

   o  algorithm is the algorithm identifier and parameters for the
      public key (see above).

Internet-Draft            Safe curves for X.509            November 2016


   o  subjectPublicKey contains the byte stream of the public key.
      While the encoded public keys for the current algorithms are all
      an even number of octets, future curves could change that.

   Both [RFC7748] and [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa] define the public key value
   as being a byte string.  It should be noted that the public key is
   computed differently for each of these documents, thus the same
   private key will not produce the same public key.

   The following is an example of a public key encoded using the textual
   encoding defined in [RFC7468].

   -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
   MCowBQYDK2VwAyEAGb9ECWmEzf6FQbrBZ9w7lshQhqowtrbLDFw4rXAxZmE=
   -----END PUBLIC KEY-----

5.  Key Usage Bits

   The intended application for the key is indicated in the keyUsage
   certificate extension.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates
   id-X25119 or id-X448 in SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then the following MUST
   be present:

           keyAgreement;

   one of the following MAY also be present:

             encipherOnly; or
             decipherOnly.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in an end-entity certificate
   that indicates id-EdDSA25519, id-EdDSA25519ph, id-EdDSA448 or id-
   EdDSA448ph , then the keyUsage extension MUST contain one or both of
   the following values:

           nonRepudiation; and
           digitalSignature.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certification authority
   certificate that indicates id-EdDSA25519 or id-EdDSA448, then the
   keyUsage extension MUST contain one or more of the following values:

          nonRepudiation;
          digitalSignature;
          keyCertSign; and
          cRLSign.

   CAs MUST NOT use the pre-hash versions of the EdDSA algorithms for
   the creation of certificates or CRLs.  This is implied by the fact
   that those algorithms are not listed in the previous paragraph.
   Additionally OCSP responders SHOULD NOT use the pre-hash versions of
   the EdDSA algorithms when generating OCSP responses.  No restriction
   is placed on generation of OCSP requests.

   AAs MUST NOT use the pre-hash versions of the EdDSA algorithms for
   the creation of attribute certificates or attribute CRLs [RFC5755].

   The decision to require the use of pure mode balances the higher
   security of having a single failure point againist the possibility
   that constrained devices, such as Hardware Security Modules (HSMs),
   may be unable to check signatures on CRLs due to the amount of memory
   required to hold the entire CRL in memory at one time.  This concern
   can be addressed by CAs using CRL distribution points, combined with
   segmenting the certificates issued so that the length of any
   segmented CRL is not "too long" evenif a large percentage of the
   certificates are revoked.  The defintion of "too long" is going to be
   highly dependent on what constrained device is being used, it can be
   on the order of single or low double digit kilobytes.

6.  EdDSA Signatures

   Signatures can be placed in a number of different ASN.1 structures.
   The top level structure for a certificate is given below as being
   illustrative of how signatures are frequently encoded with an
   algorithm identifier and a location for the signature.

      Certificate  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
           tbsCertificate       TBSCertificate,
           signatureAlgorithm   AlgorithmIdentifier,
           signatureValue       BIT STRING  }

   The same algorithm identifiers are used for signatures as are used
   for public keys.  When used to identify signature algorithms, the
   parameters MUST be absent.

   The data to be signed is prepared for EdDSA.  Then, a private key
   operation is performed to generate the signature value.  This value
   is the opaque value ENC(R) || ENC(S) described in section 3.3 of
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa].  The octet string representing the signature
   is encoded directly in the BIT STRING without adding any additional
   ASN.1 wrapping.  For the Certificate structure, the signature value
   is wrapped in the 'signatureValue' BIT STRING field.

   When the pre-hash versions of the EdDSA signature algorithms are
   used, the hash function used for the pre-hash is defined by the



Josefsson & Schaad        Expires May 27, 2017                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft            Safe curves for X.509            November 2016


   algorithm.  This means that the pre-hash function is implicitly
   included in the algorithm identifier rather than being explicit as
   done in [RFC3279].

7.  Private Key Format

   Asymmetric Key Packages [RFC5958] describes how encode a private key
   in a structure that both identifies what algorithm the private key is
   for, but allows for the public key and additional attributes about
   the key to be included as well.  For illustration, the ASN.1
   structure OneAsymmetricKey is replicated below.  The algorithm
   specific details of how a private key is encoded is left for the
   document describing the algorithm itself.

   OneAsymmetricKey ::= SEQUENCE {
      version Version,
      privateKeyAlgorithm PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier,
      privateKey PrivateKey,
      attributes [0] Attributes OPTIONAL,
      ...,
      [[2: publicKey [1] PublicKey OPTIONAL ]],
      ...
   }

   PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING

   PublicKey ::= OCTET STRING

   For the keys defined in this document, the private key is always an
   opaque byte sequence.  The ASN.1 type EdPrivateKey is defined in this
   document to hold the byte sequence.  Thus when encoding a
   OneAsymmetricKey object, the private key is wrapped in an
   EdPrivateKey object and then placed in the 'privateKey' field.

   EdPrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING

   To encode a EdDSA, X25519 or X448 private key, the "privateKey" field
   will hold the encoded private key.  The "privateKeyAlgorithm" field
   uses the AlgorithmIdentifier structure.  The structure is encoded as
   defined above.  If present, the "publicKey" field will hold the
   encoded key as defined in [RFC7748] and [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa].
   public key.

   The following is an example of a private key encoded using the
   textual encoding defined in [RFC7468].

8.  Human Readable Algorithm Names

   For the purpose of consistent cross-implementation naming this
   section establishes human readable names for the algorithms specified
   in this document.  Implementations SHOULD use these names when
   referring to the algorithms.  If there is a strong reason to deviate
   from these names -- for example, if the implementation has a
   different naming convention and wants to maintain internal
   consistency -- it is encouraged to deviate as little as possible from
   the names given here.

   Use the string "ECDH" when referring to a public key of type X25519
   or X448 when the curve is not known or relevant.

   When the curve is known, use the more specific string of X25519 or
   X448.

   Use the string "EdDSA" when referring to a signing public key or
   signature when the curve is not known or relevant.

   When the curve is known, use a more specific string.  For the id-
   EdDSA25519 value use the string "Ed25519".  For the id-EdDSA25519ph
   value use the string "Ed25519ph".  For id-EdDSA448 use "Ed448".  For
   id-EdDSA448ph use "Ed448ph".

12.  IANA Considerations

   None.

13.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC5280], [RFC7748], and
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa] apply accordingly.

   The procedures for going from a private key to a public key is
   different for when used with Diffie-Helman and when used with Edwards
   Signatures.  This means that the same public key cannot be used for
   both ECDH and EdDSA.

   In the original design of Ed25519 signatures, there was a known
   attack between the pure and the pre-hash version of the signatures.
   This has since been corrected in the final version of the design.
   The initial problem meant that there was a known attack, and
   therefore a known reason to forbid the use of Ed25519 keys with the
   Ed25519ph signature scheme and visa versa.  With the change in the
   design this attack has been prevented.  This does not mean that the
   same Ed25519 key should be used with both schemes, there still may be
   attacks where collisions can be found.  For this reason, the same
   keys are not to be used for the pure and pre-hash versions of the
   scheme.  This applies to both curve 25519 and curve 448.
