Abstract

   This document discusses and defines a number of tests that may  be  used
   to  describe  the  performance  characteristics  of  ATM based switching
   devices.  In addition to defining the tests this document also describes
   specific formats for reporting the results of the tests.

   Appendix  A  lists  the  tests  and conditions that we believe should be
   included for specific  cases  and  gives  additional  information  about
   testing practices.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           March 2000


   This  memo  is  a  product of the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group
   (BMWG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

1. Introduction.

   This document defines a specific set of tests that vendors  can  use  to
   measure  and  report  the  performance  characteristics  of  ATM network
   devices.  The results of these tests will provide  the  user  comparable
   data  from  different vendors with which to evaluate these devices.  The
   methods defined in  this  memo  are  based  on  RFC  2544  "Benchmarking
   Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices".

   The document "Terminology for ATM Benchmarking" (RFC 2761), defines many
   of the terms that are used in this document.  The  terminology  document
   should be consulted before attempting to make use of this document.

   The   BMWG   produces  two  major  classes  of  documents:  Benchmarking
   Terminology  documents  and  Benchmarking  Methodology  documents.   The
   Terminology  documents  present  the benchmarks and other related terms.
   The Methodology documents define the procedures required to collect  the
   benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents.

2. Background

2.1. Test Device Requirements

   This  document  is  based  on  the  requirement  that  a  test device is
   available.  The test device can either be off the shelf or can be easily
   built   with   current  technologies.   The  test  device  must  have  a
   transmitting and receiving port for the interface type under test.   The
   test  device  must  be  configured  to transmit test PDUs and to analyze
   received PDUs.  The test device should be able to transmit  and  analyze
   received data at the same time.

2.2. Systems Under Test (SUTs)

   There are a number of tests described in this document that do not apply
   to each SUT. Vendors should  perform  all  of  the  tests  that  can  be
   supported by a specific product type.  It will take some time to perform
   all of the recommended tests under all of  the  recommended  conditions.
   Appendix A lists some of the tests and conditions that we believe should
   be included for specific cases.

2.3. Test Result Evaluation

   Performing all of the tests in this document will result in a great deal
   of  data.  The  applicability  of  this  data  to  the  evaluation  of a
   particular SUT will depend on its expected use and the configuration  of
   the network in which it will be used.  For example, the time required by
   a switch to provide ILMI services will not be a pertinent measurement in
   a  network  that  does  not  use  the ILMI protocol, such as an ATM WAN.
   Evaluating data  relevant  to  a  particular  network  installation  may
   require  considerable  experience,  which  may not be readily available.
   Finally, test selection and evaluation of test results must be done with
   an  understanding  of  generally  accepted  testing  practices regarding
   repeatability, variance and the  statistical  significance  of  a  small
   numbers of trials.

2.4. Requirements

   In  this document, the words that are used to define the significance of
   each particular requirement are capitalized. These words are:

   * "MUST" This word, or the words "REQUIRED" and "SHALL"  mean  that  the
   item is an absolute requirement of the specification.

   * "SHOULD" This word or the adjective "RECOMMENDED" means that there may
   exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore this item, but
   the  full  implications  should  be  understood  and  the case carefully
   weighed before choosing a different course.

   * "MAY" This word or the adjective "OPTIONAL" means that  this  item  is
   truly  optional.   One  vendor  may choose to include the item because a
   particular marketplace requires it or because it enhances  the  product,
   for example; another vendor may omit the same item.

   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more of
   the  MUST  requirements   for   the   protocols   it   implements.    An
   implementation   that   satisfies  all  the  MUST  and  all  the  SHOULD
   requirements  for  its  protocols  is  said   to   be   "unconditionally
   compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST requirements but not all the
   SHOULD requirements for its  protocols  is  said  to  be  "conditionally
   compliant".

2.5. Test Configurations for SONET

INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           March 2000


   The   test  device  can  be  connected  to  the  SUT  in  a  variety  of
   configurations   depending   on   the   test   point.    The   following
   configurations will be used for the tests described in this document.

   1)  Uni-directional  connection: The test devices transmit port (labeled
   Tx) is connected to  the  SUT  receive  port  (labeled  Rx).   The  SUTs
   transmit  port  is connected to the test device receive port (see Figure
   1).  In  this  configuration,  the  test  device  can  verify  that  all
   transmitted   packets   are  acknowledged  correctly.   Note  that  this
   configuration does not verify internal system  functions,  but  verifies
   one port on the SUT.




      +-------------+               +-------------+
      |           Tx|-------------->|Rx           |
      |    Test   Rx|<--------------|Tx   SUT     |
      |   Device    |               |             |
      +-------------+               +-------------+

                      Figure 1


   2) Bi-directional connection: The test devices first transmit port is
   connected to the SUTs first receive port.  The SUTs first transmit port
   is connected to the test devices first receive port.  The test devices
   second transmit port is connected to the SUTs second receive port.  The
   SUTs second transmit port is connected to the test devices second
   receive port (see Figure 2). In this configuration, the test device can
   determine if all of the transmitted packets were received and forwarded
   correctly.  Note that this configuration does verify internal system
   functions, since it verifies two ports on the SUT.

      +-------------+               +-------------+
      |     Test  Tx|-------------->|Rx           |
      |    Device Rx|<--------------|Tx   SUT     |
      |    Tx   Rx  |               |   Tx   Rx   |
      +-------------+               +-------------+
            |   ^                        |    ^

   2) Uni-directional passthrough connection: The test devices first
   transmit port is connected to the SUT1 receive port.  The SUT1 transmit
   port is connected to the test devices first receive port. The test
   devices second transmit port is connected to the SUT2 receive port.  The
   SUT2 transmit port is connected to the test devices second receive port
   (see Figure 3). In this configuration, the test device can determine if
   all of the packets transmitted by SUT1 were correctly acknowledged by
   SUT2.  Note that this configuration does not verify internal system
   functions, but verifies one port on each SUT.

   +-------------+           +-------------+           +-------------+

                              Figure 3

2.5. SUT Configuration

   The  SUT  MUST  be  configured  as  described  in  the  SUT users guide.
   Specifically, it is expected that all of the supported protocols will be
   configured and enabled (See Appendix A).  It is expected that all of the
   tests will be run without changing the configuration or setup of the SUT
   in  any  way  other  than  that  required  to do the specific test.  For
   example, it is not acceptable to disable all but one transport  protocol
   when  testing the throughput of that protocol.  If PNNI or BISUP is used
   to initiate switched virtual connections (SVCs), the  SUT  configuration
   SHOULD  include  the  normally  recommended routing update intervals and
   keep alive frequency.  The specific version  of  the  software  and  the
   exact  SUT configuration, including what functions are disabled and used
   during the tests MUST be included as part of the report of the  results.

2.6. Frame formats

   The  formats of the test IP PDUs to use for TCP/IP over ATM are shown in
   Appendix C: Test  Frame  Formats.   Note  that  these  IP  PDUs  are  in



Dunn & Martin                                                      [Page 5]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           March 2000


   accordance  with RFC 2225.  These exact IP PDU formats SHOULD be used in
   the  tests  described  in  this   document   for   this   protocol/media
   combination.  These IP PDUs will be used as a template for testing other
   protocol/media combinations.  The specific  formats  that  are  used  to
   define the test IP PDUs for a particular test series MUST be included in
   the report of the results.

2.7. Frame sizes

   All of the described tests SHOULD be performed using a number of IP  PDU
   sizes.  Specifically,  the  sizes SHOULD include the maximum and minimum
   legitimate sizes for the protocol under test on the media under test and
   enough sizes in between to be able to get a full characterization of the
   SUT performance.  Except where noted, at least five IP PDU sizes  SHOULD
   be tested for each test condition.

   Theoretically  the minimum size UDP Echo request IP PDU would consist of
   an IP header (minimum length 20 octets), a UDP header (8  octets),  AAL5
   trailer  (8  octets)  and  an  LLC/SNAP  code  point  header(8  octets);
   therefore, the minimum size  PDU  will  fit  into  one  ATM  cell.   The
   theoretical  maximum IP PDU size is determined by the size of the length
   field in the IP header.  In almost all  cases  the  actual  maximum  and
   minimum  sizes  are  determined by the limitations of the media.  In the
   case of ATM, the maximum IP PDU size SHOULD be the ATM MTU  size,  which
   is 9180 octets.

   In theory it would be ideal to distribute the IP PDU sizes in a way that
   would  evenly  distribute  the  theoretical   IP   PDU   rates.    These
   recommendations  incorporate this theory but specify IP PDU sizes, which
   are easy to understand and remember.  In addition, many of the  same  IP
   PDU  sizes  are  specified  on each of the media types to allow for easy
   performance comparisons.

   Note: The inclusion of an unrealistically small IP PDU size on  some  of
   the  media  types  (i.e.  with  little  or no space for data) is to help
   characterize the per-IP PDU processing overhead of the SUT.

   The IP PDU sizes that will be used are:

   44, 64, 128, 256, 1024, 1518, 2048, 4472, 9180

   The minimum size IP PDU for UDP on ATM is 44 octets, the minimum size of



Dunn & Martin                                                      [Page 6]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           March 2000


   44  is recommended to allow direct comparison to token ring performance.
   The IP PDU size of 4472 is recommended instead of the  theoretical  FDDI
   maximum  size  of  4500  octets  in  order  to  permit  the same type of
   comparison. An IP (i.e. not UDP) IP PDU may be used  in  addition  if  a
   higher data rate is desired, in which case the minimum IP PDU size is 28
   octets.

2.8. Verifying received IP PDUs

   The test equipment SHOULD discard any IP PDUs received during a test run
   that are not actual forwarded test IP PDUs.  For example, keep-alive and
   routing update IP PDUs SHOULD NOT be included in the count  of  received
   IP  PDUs.   In  any case, the test equipment SHOULD verify the length of
   the received IP PDUs and check that they match the expected length.

   Preferably, the test equipment SHOULD include sequence  numbers  in  the
   transmitted IP PDUs and check for these numbers on the received IP PDUs.
   If this is done, the reported results SHOULD include. in addition to the
   number  of IP PDUs dropped, the number of IP PDUs that were received out
   of order, the number of duplicate IP PDUs received  and  the  number  of
   gaps  in  the received IP PDU numbering sequence.  This functionality is
   required for some of the described tests.

2.9. Modifiers

   It is useful to characterize the SUTs  performance  under  a  number  of
   conditions.  Some  of  these  conditions  are noted below.  The reported
   results SHOULD include as many of these conditions as the test equipment
   is able to generate.  The suite of tests SHOULD be run first without any
   modifying  conditions,  then  repeated  under  each  of  the   modifying
   conditions  separately.   To preserve the ability to compare the results
   of these tests, any IP PDUs that are required to generate the  modifying
   conditions  (excluding  management queries) will be included in the same
   data stream as that of the normal test IP PDUs and in place  of  one  of
   the  test  IP  PDUs.  They MUST not be supplied to the SUT on a separate
   network port.

2.9.1. Management IP PDUs

   Most ATM data networks now make use of ILMI, signaling and OAM. In  many
   environments,  there  can  be  a  number  of management stations sending
   queries to the same SUT at the same time.



Dunn & Martin                                                      [Page 7]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           March 2000


   Management queries MUST  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  applicable
   specification,  e.g.,  ILMI  sysUpTime  getNext requests will be made in
   accordance with ILMI 4.0. The response to the query MUST be verified  by
   the test equipment. Note that, for each management protocol in use, this
   requires that the test equipment implement the associated protocol state
   machine.   One  example of the specific query IP PDU that should be used
   is shown in Appendix B.

2.9.2. Routing update IP PDUs

   The processing of PNNI updates could have a significant  impact  on  the
   ability  of  a  switch  to forward cells and complete calls.  If PNNI is
   configured on the SUT, one routing update MUST be transmitted before the
   first  test  IP  PDU  is  transmitted during the trial.  The test SHOULD
   verify that the SUT has properly processed the routing update.

   PNNI routing update IP PDUs SHOULD be sent  at  the  rate  specified  in
   Appendix  B.  Appendix  C defines two routing update PDUs for the TCP/IP
   over ATM example.  The  routing  updates  are  designed  to  change  the
   routing  on a number of networks that are not involved in the forwarding
   of the test data.  The first IP PDU sets the routing table state to "A",
   the second one changes the state to "B".  The IP PDUs MUST be alternated
   during the trial. The test SHOULD  verify  that  the  SUT  has  properly
   processed the routing update.

2.10. Filters

   Filters  are  added to switches to selectively inhibit the forwarding of
   cells that would  normally  be  forwarded.   This  is  usually  done  to
   implement  security  controls  on  the data that is accepted between one
   area and another. Different  products  have  different  capabilities  to
   implement filters.

   The  SUT  SHOULD be first configured to add one filter condition and the
   tests performed.  This filter SHOULD permit the forwarding of  the  test
   data stream. This filter SHOULD be of the form:

        To be determined.

   The  SUT SHOULD be then reconfigured to implement a total of 25 filters.
   The first 24 of these filters SHOULD be of the form:




Dunn & Martin                                                      [Page 8]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           March 2000


        To be determined.

   The 24 ATM addresses SHOULD not be any that are represented in the  test
   data  stream.   The last filter SHOULD permit the forwarding of the test
   data stream.  By "first" and "last" we mean to ensure that in the second
   case,  25  conditions must be checked before the data IP PDUs will match
   the conditions that permit the forwarding of the IP PDU. Of  course,  if
   the SUT reorders the filters or does not use a linear scan of the filter
   rules the effect of the sequence in  which  the  filters  are  input  is
   properly lost.

   The  exact  filters  configuration command lines used SHOULD be included
   with the report of the results.

2.10.1. Filter Addresses

   Two sets of filter addresses are required, one  for  the  single  filter
   case and one for the 25 filter case.

   The  single  filter  case should permit traffic from ATM address [Switch
   Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00  to  ATM  address  [Switch  Network
   Prefix]  00 00 00 00 00 02 00 and deny all other traffic.  Note that the
   13 octet Switch Network Prefix MUST be configured before this  test  can
   be run.

   The 25 filter case should follow the following sequence.

        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 03 00
        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 04 00
        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 05 00
        ...
        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 0C 00
        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 0D 00
        allow [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 02 00
        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 0E 00



Dunn & Martin                                                      [Page 9]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           March 2000


        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 0F 00
         ...
        deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
             to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 18 00
        deny all else

   All  previous filter conditions should be cleared from the switch before
   this sequence is entered.  The sequence is selected to test  to  see  if
   the switch sorts the filter conditions or accepts them in the order that
   they were entered.  Both of these procedures will result  in  a  greater
   impact on performance than will some form of hash coding.

2.11. Protocol addresses

   It  is  easier to implement these tests using a single logical stream of
   data, with one source ATM address and one destination ATM  address,  and
   for  some  conditions  like  the  filters  described  above, a practical
   requirement.  Networks in the real  world  are  not  limited  to  single
   streams  of  data.  The test suite SHOULD be first run with a single ATM
   source and destination address pair.  The tests SHOULD then be  repeated
   with  using a random destination address.  In the case of testing single
   switches, the addresses SHOULD be random and uniformly distributed  over
   a  range of 256 seven octet user parts.  In the case of testing multiple
   interconnected switches, the addresses SHOULD be  random  and  uniformly
   distributed  over the 256 network prefixes, each of which should support
   256 seven octet user parts.  The specific address ranges to use for  ATM
   are shown in Appendix B.  IP to ATM address mapping MUST be accomplished
   as described in RFC 2225.

2.12. Route Set Up

   It is not reasonable that all of the routing  information  necessary  to
   forward  the  test stream, especially in the multiple address case, will
   be manually set up.  If PNNI and/or ILMI are running, at  the  start  of
   each trial a routing update MUST be sent to the SUT. This routing update
   MUST include all of the ATM addresses that  will  be  required  for  the
   trial.  This  routing  update  will  have to be repeated at the interval
   required by PNNI or ILMI.  An  example  of  the  format  and  repetition
   interval of the update IP PDUs is given in Appendix B.

2.13. Bidirectional traffic



Dunn & Martin                                                     [Page 10]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           March 2000


   Bidirectional  performance  tests  SHOULD be run with the same data rate
   being offered from each direction. The sum of the data rates should  not
   exceed the theoretical limit for the media.

2.14. Single stream path

   The full suite of tests SHOULD be run with the appropriate modifiers for
   a single receive and transmit port on the SUT. If the internal design of
   the  SUT has multiple distinct pathways, for example, multiple interface
   cards each with multiple network ports, then all  possible  permutations
   of  pathways  SHOULD  be  tested separately.  If multiple interconnected
   switches are tested, the test MUST specify routes, which allow only  one
   path between source and destination ATM addresses.

2.15. Multi-port

   Many switch products provide several network ports on the same interface
   module. Each port on an interface module  SHOULD  be  stimulated  in  an
   identical manner.  Specifically, half of the ports on each module SHOULD
   be receive ports and half SHOULD be transmit ports.  For  example  if  a
   SUT  has two interface module each of which has four ports, two ports on
   each interface module be receive ports and two will be  transmit  ports.
   Each  receive port MUST be offered the same data rate.  The addresses in
   the input data streams SHOULD be set so that an IP PDU will be  directed
   to  each of the transmit ports in sequence.  That is, all transmit ports
   will receive an identical distribution of  IP  PDUs  from  a  particular
   receive port.


   Consider the following 6 port SUT:

             --------------
    ---------| Rx A   Tx X|--------
    ---------| Rx B   Tx Y|--------
    ---------| Rx C   Tx Z|--------
             --------------

   The addressing of the data streams for each of the inputs SHOULD be:

     stream sent to Rx A:
       IP PDU to Tx X, IP PDU to Tx Y, IP PDU to Tx Z
     stream sent to Rx B:



Dunn & Martin                                                     [Page 11]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           March 2000


       IP PDU to Tx X, IP PDU to Tx Y, IP PDU to Tx Z
     stream sent to Rx C
       IP PDU to Tx X, IP PDU to Tx Y, IP PDU to Tx Z

   Note:   Each  stream  contains  the  same  sequence  of  IP  destination
   addresses;  therefore,  each  transmit  port  will  receive  3  IP  PDUs
   simultaneously. This procedure ensures that the SUT will have to process
   multiple IP PDUs addressed to the same transmit port simultaneously.

   The same configuration MAY be used to perform  a  bi-directional  multi-
   stream  test.  In this case all of the ports are considered both receive
   and transmit ports.  Each data stream MUST  consist  of  IP  PDUs  whose
   addresses correspond to the ATM addresses all of the other ports.

2.16. Multiple protocols

   This  document  does  not  address the issue of testing the effects of a
   mixed protocol environment other than to suggest that if such tests  are
   wanted  then  PDUs  SHOULD  be  distributed  between  all  of  the  test
   protocols.  The distribution  MAY  approximate  the  conditions  on  the
   network in which the SUT would be used.

2.17. Multiple IP PDU sizes

   This  document  does  not  address the issue of testing the effects of a
   mixed IP PDU size environment other than to suggest that, if such  tests
   are required, then IP PDU size SHOULD be evenly distributed among all of
   the PDU sizes listed in this document.  The distribution MAY approximate
   the conditions on the network in which the SUT would be used.

2.18. Testing beyond a single SUT

   In  the  performance  testing  of  a  single  SUT,  the  paradigm can be
   described as applying some input to a SUT and monitoring the output. The
   results of which can be used to form a basis of characterization of that
   device under those test conditions.

   This model is useful when the  test  input  and  output  are  homogenous
   (e.g., 64-byte IP, AAL5 PDUs into the SUT; 64 byte IP, AAL5 PDUs out).

   By  extending the single SUT test model, reasonable benchmarks regarding
   multiple SUTs or heterogeneous environments may be  collected.  In  this



Dunn & Martin                                                     [Page 12]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           March 2000


   extension,  the  single  SUT  is  replaced by a system of interconnected
   network SUTs. This test methodology would support the benchmarking of  a
   variety  of  device/media/service/protocol  combinations. For example, a
   configuration for a LAN-to-WAN-to-LAN test might be:

       (1) ATM UNI -> SUT 1 -> BISUP -> SUT 2 -> ATM UNI

   Or an extended LAN configuration might be:

       (2) ATM UNI -> SUT 1 -> PNNI Network -> SUT 2 -> ATM UNI

   In both examples 1 and 2, end-to-end benchmarks of each system could  be
   empirically ascertained. Other behavior may be characterized through the
   use of intermediate devices. In example 2, the configuration may be used
   to give an indication of the effect of PNNI routing on IP throughput.

   Because  multiple  SUTs  are  treated  as  a  single  system,  there are
   limitations to this methodology.  For  instance,  this  methodology  may
   yield  an aggregate benchmark for a tested system. That benchmark alone,
   however, may not necessarily reflect asymmetries in behavior between the
   SUTs,   latencies   introduced  by  other  apparatus  (e.g.,  CSUs/DSUs,
   switches), etc.

   Further, care must  be  used  when  comparing  benchmarks  of  different
   systems  by  ensuring  that  the SUTs' features and configuration of the
   tested  systems  have  the  appropriate  common  denominators  to  allow
   comparison.

2.19. Maximum IP PDU rate

   The  maximum  IP  PDU  rates  that  should  be  used  when  testing  LAN
   connections SHOULD be the listed theoretical maximum rate for the IP PDU
   size on the media.

   The maximum IP PDU rate that should be used when testing WAN connections
   SHOULD be greater than the listed theoretical maximum rate  for  the  IP
   PDU  size on that speed connection.  The higher rate for WAN tests is to
   compensate for the fact that some vendors employ various forms of header
   compression.

   A  list  of  maximum  IP  PDU  rates  for LAN connections is included in
   Appendix B.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           March 2000


2.20. Bursty traffic

   It is convenient to measure the SUT performance under steady state load;
   however,  this  is an unrealistic way to gauge the functioning of a SUT.
   Actual network traffic normally consists of bursts of IP PDUs.

   Some of the tests described below SHOULD be performed with both constant
   bit  rate,  bursty Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR) Best Effort [AF-TM4.0] and
   Variable Bit Rate Non-real Time (VBR-nrt) Best Effort  [AF-TM4.0].   The
   IP  PDUs  within  a  burst  are  transmitted with the minimum legitimate
   inter-IP PDU gap.

   The objective of the test is to determine the minimum  interval  between
   bursts  that  the  SUT can process with no IP PDU loss.  Tests SHOULD be
   run with burst sizes of 10% of Maximum Burst Size (MBS), 20% of MBS, 50%
   of MBS and 100% MBS.  Note that the number of IP PDUs in each burst will
   depend on the PDU size. For UBR, the MBS refers to  the  associated  VBR
   traffic parameters.

2.21. Trial description

   A  particular  test consists of multiple trials.  Each trial returns one
   piece of information, for example the loss rate at a particular input IP
   PDU rate.  Each trial consists of five of phases:

   a)  If  the  SUT is a switch supporting PNNI, send the routing update to
   the SUT receive port and wait two seconds to be sure  that  the  routing
   has settled.

   b) Send an ATM ARP PDU to determine the ATM address corresponding to the
   destination IP address.  The formats of the ATM ARP PDU that  should  be
   used  are  shown  in  the  Test  Frame  Formats  document and MUST be in
   accordance with RFC 2225.

   c) Stimulate SUT with traffic load.

   d) Wait for two seconds for any residual IP PDUs to be received.

   e) Wait for at least five seconds for the SUT to restabilize.

2.22. Trial duration




Dunn & Martin                                                     [Page 14]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           March 2000


   The objective of the tests defined in this  document  is  to  accurately
   characterize  the  behavior  of  a particular piece of network equipment
   under varying traffic loads.  The choice of  test  duration  must  be  a
   compromise  between  this  objective  and  keeping  the  duration of the
   benchmarking test suite within reasonable bounds.   The  SUT  SHOULD  be
   stimulated  for  at  least 60 seconds.  If this time period results in a
   high variance in the test results, the SUT SHOULD be stimulated  for  at
   least 300 seconds.

2.23. Address resolution

   The  SUT  MUST be able to respond to address resolution requests sent by
   another SUT, an ATM ARP server or the test equipment in accordance  with
   RFC 2225.

2.24. Synchronized Payload Bit Pattern.

   Some  measurements assume that both the transmitter and receiver payload
   information  is  synchronized.  Synchronization  MUST  be  achieved   by
   supplying  a  known  bit  pattern  to both the transmitter and receiver.
   This bit pattern MUST be one of the following: PRBS-15, PRBS-23, 0xFF00,
   or 0xAA55.

2.25. Burst Traffic Descriptors.

   Some  measurements  require busty traffic patterns.  These patterns MUST
   conform to one of the following traffic descriptors:

   1) PCR=100% allotted line rate, SCR=50% allotted line rate, and MBS=8192

   2) PCR=100% allotted line rate, SCR=50% allotted line rate, and MBS=4096

   3) PCR=90% allotted line rate, SCR=50% allotted line rate, and MBS=8192

   4) PCR=90% allotted line rate, SCR=50% allotted line rate, and MBS=4096

   5) PCR=90% allotted line rate, SCR=45% allotted line rate, and MBS=8192

   6) PCR=90% allotted line rate, SCR=45% allotted line rate, and MBS=4096

   7) PCR=80% allotted line rate, SCR=40% allotted line rate, and MBS=65536

   8) PCR=80% allotted line rate, SCR=40% allotted line rate, and MBS=32768

   The allotted line rate refers to the total available line  rate  divided
   by the number of VCCs in use.

   ns  resolution)  to  both  the  transmitter  and  receiver.  The maximum
   timestamp values MUST be recorded to ensure synchronization in the  case
   of  counter  rollover.   The  cell delay measurements SHOULD utilize the

3.2.2. Cell Error Ratio (CER)

3.2.2.1. Test Setup

   The cell error ratio measurements assume that both the  transmitter  and
   receiver  payload  information  is synchronized. Synchronization MUST be
   achieved by supplying a known bit pattern to both  the  transmitter  and
   receiver.   If  this  bit  pattern  is  longer than the packet size, the
   receiver MUST synchronize with the transmitter before tests can be  run.

Objective:  To  determine  the  SUT  ratio of errored cells on one VCC in a
transmission in relation to the total cells sent as  defined  in  RFC  2761

Procedure:

   1)   Set   up   the   SUT  and  test  device  using  the  bi-directional
   configuration.

   2) Configure the SUT and test device  with  one  VCC.   The  VCC  SHOULD
   contain one VPI/VCI. The VCC MUST be configured as either a CBR, VBR, or
   UBR connection.  The VPI/VCI  MUST  not  be  one  of  the  reserved  ATM
   signaling channels (e.g. [0,5], [0,16]).

   3)  Send a specific number of IP packets containing one of the specified
   bit patterns at a constant rate through the SUT  via  the  defined  test
   VCC.   Since  this test is not a throughput test, the rate should not be
   greater than 90% of line rate.  The IP  PDUs  MUST  be  encapsulated  in

   the  SUT,  continue  the  test;  else lower the test device traffic rate
   until the counts are the same.

   1)   Set   up   the   SUT  and  test  device  using  the  bi-directional
   configuration.

   2) Configure the SUT and test device with three VCC's.  Each VCC MUST be
   defined as a different Bearer class; one CBR, one UBR and one VBR.  Each
   VCC SHOULD contain one VPI/VCI.  The VPI/VCI MUST  not  be  one  of  the
   reserved ATM signaling channels (e.g. [0,5], [0,16]).

   3)  Send a specific number of IP packets containing one of the specified
   bit patterns through the SUT via the defined test VCCs.  Each  generated
   VCC  stream  MUST  match the corresponding VCC Bearer class.  All of the
   VPI/VCI pairs will generate traffic at the  same  traffic  rate.   Since
   this  test is not a throughput test, the rate should not be greater than
   90% of line rate.  The IP PDUs MUST be encapsulated in AAL5.

   4) Count the IP packets that  are  transmitted  by  the  SUT  to  verify
   connectivity  and  load.  If the count on the test device is the same on
   the SUT, continue the test; else lower  the  test  device  traffic  rate
   until the counts are the same.

   device for all VCCs.

   3.2.7.1. Test Setup

   The cell transfer delay measurements assume that  both  the  transmitter
   and  receiver  timestamp  information  is  synchronized. Synchronization
   SHOULD be achieved by supplying a common clock signal  (minimum  of  100
   Mhz  or  10  ns  resolution)  to both the transmitter and receiver.  The
   maximum timestamp values MUST be recorded to ensure  synchronization  in
   the  case  of  counter  rollover.   The cell transfer delay measurements
   SHOULD utilize the O.191 cell (ITUT-O.191) encapsulated in  a  valid  IP
   packet.  If the O.191 cell is not available, a test cell encapsulated in
   a valid IP packet MAY be used.  The test cell MUST  contain  a  transmit
   timestamp   which   can  be  correlated  with  a  receive  timestamp.  A
   description of the test cell MUST be included in the test results.   The
   description  MUST  include  the  timestamp  length  (in  bits),  counter
   rollover value, and the timestamp accuracy (in ns).

   1)  Set  up  the  SUT  and  test   device   using   the   bi-directional
   configuration.

   2) Configure the SUT and test device with three VCC's.  Each VCC MUST be
   defined as a different Bearer class: one CBR, one UBR and one VBR.  Each
   VCC  SHOULD  contain  one  VPI/VCI.   The VPI/VCI MUST not be one of the
   reserved ATM signaling channels (e.g. [0,5], [0,16]).

   3) Send a specific number of IP packets  containing  timestamps  through
   the  SUT via the defined test VCCs. Each generated VCC stream MUST match
   the corresponding VCC Bearer class.   All  of  the  VPI/VCI  pairs  will
   generate  traffic  at  the  same traffic rate.  Since this test is not a
   throughput test, the rate should not be greater than 90% of  line  rate.
   The IP PDUs MUST be encapsulated in AAL5.

   4)  Count  the  IP  packets  that  are  transmitted by the SUT to verify
   connectivity and load.  If the count on the test device is the  same  on
   the  SUT,  continue  the  test;  else lower the test device traffic rate
   until the counts are the same.

   5) Record the packets timestamps at the transmitter and receiver ends of
   the test device for all VCC's.

   the SUT via the defined test VCCs. Each generated VCC stream MUST  match
   the  corresponding  VCC  Bearer  class.   All  of the VPI/VCI pairs will
   generate traffic at the same traffic rate.  Since this  test  is  not  a
   throughput  test,  the rate should not be greater than 90% of line rate.
   The IP PDUs MUST be encapsulated in AAL5.

   4) Count the IP packets that are transmitted by the SUT on all  VCCs  to
   verify  connectivity  and  load.  If the count on the test device is the
   same on the SUT, continue the test; else lower the test  device  traffic
   rate until the counts are the same.

   5) Record the packets timestamps at the transmitter and receiver ends of
   the test device for all VCCs.

Reporting Format:

   The results of the CTD/Mixed Load/Twelve VCCs test SHOULD be reported in
   a form of text, graph, and histograms.

   The  text  results  SHOULD display the numerical values of the CTD.  The
   values given SHOULD include: time period of  test  in  s,  test  VPI/VCI
   values,  total  number  of  cells  transmitted  and received on each VCC
   during the test in positive integers, maximum and minimum  CTD  on  each
   VCC during the test in us, and mean CTD on each VCC in us.

   The graph results SHOULD display the cell transfer delay values.  The x-
   coordinate SHOULD be the test run time in  either  seconds,  minutes  or
   days  depending  on  the total length of the test. The x-coordinate time
   SHOULD be configurable.  The y-coordinate SHOULD be  the  cell  transfer

3.2.7.10. CTD/Mixed Load/Maximum VCCs

Objective: To determine the SUT variation in cell transfer delay  with  the
maximum   number  VCCs  supported  on  the  SUT  as  defined  in  RFC  2761
"Terminology for ATM Benchmarking".

Procedure:

   1)  Set  up  the  SUT  and  test   device   using   the   bi-directional
   configuration.

   2)  Configure  the  SUT  and  test  device  with  maximum number of VCCs
   supported on the SUT.  For  example,  if  the  maximum  number  of  VCCs
   supported on the SUT is 1024, define 256 VPIs with 4 VCIs per VPI.  Each
   VCC MUST be defined as one of the Bearer classes for  a  total  of  (max
   VCC/3)  CBR,  (max  VCC/3) UBR and (max VCC/3) VBR VCC's. If the maximum
   number of VCC's is not divisible by 3, the total for each  bearer  class
   MUST  be  within  3 VCC's of each other.  The VPI/VCI MUST not be one of
   the reserved ATM signaling channels (e.g. [0,5], [0,16]).

   3) Send a specific number of IP packets  containing  timestamps  through
   the  SUT via the defined test VCCs. Each generated VCC stream MUST match
   the corresponding VCC Bearer class.   All  of  the  VPI/VCI  pairs  will
   generate  traffic  at  the  same traffic rate.  Since this test is not a
   throughput test, the rate should not be greater than 90% of  line  rate.
   The IP PDUs MUST be encapsulated in AAL5.

   4)  Count  the IP packets that are transmitted by the SUT on all VCCs to
   verify connectivity and load.  If the count on the test  device  is  the
   same  on  the SUT, continue the test; else lower the test device traffic
   rate until the counts are the same.

   5) Record the packets timestamps at the transmitter and receiver ends of
   the test device for all VCCs.

Reporting Format:

   The  results  of the CTD/Mixed Load/Maximum VCCs test SHOULD be reported
   in a form of text, graphs, and histograms.
