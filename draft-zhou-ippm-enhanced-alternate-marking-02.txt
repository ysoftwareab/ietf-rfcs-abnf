1.  Introduction

   The Alternate Marking [RFC8321] technique is an hybrid performance
   measurement method, per [RFC7799] classification of measurement
   methods.  It can be used to measure packet loss, latency, and jitter
   on live traffic.  Because this method is based on marking consecutive
   batches of packets.

   For the basic Alternate Marking method, bits are needed to record the
   mark.  However, in some protocols, no additional bit can be used,
   which blocks the wide deployment of the alternate marking technique.
   And the basic Alternate Marking method is limited with the
   scalability for further extension.

Internet-Draft         enhanced-alternate-marking              June 2019


   This document proposes several ways to encapsulate the alternate
   marking field with enough space.  More information can be considered
   within the alternate marking field to facilitate the efficiency and
   ease the deployment.  Specifically, the flow identifier is applied as
   an enhancement for the basic Alternate Marking when determining
   packet loss and packet delay measurement.  The flow identifier helps
   the data plane to identify the specific flow, hence to do the
   processing with respect to the Alternate Marking.  It also simplifies
   the export by directly being encapsulated as the index for the
   associated metrics.

2.  Encapsulation Considerations

2.1.  Use the IOAM Data

   In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM
   [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data]) defines a generic meta data structure to
   records OAM information within user packets while the packets
   traverse a network.  The data types and data formats for IOAM data
   records have been defined in [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  The IOAM
   data can be embedded in many protocol encapsulations such as Network
   Services Header, Segment Routing, and IPv6
   [I-D.brockners-inband-oam-transport].

   The IOAM edge-to-edge option is to carry data that is added by the
   IOAM encapsulating node and interpreted by IOAM decapsulating node.
   It provide a bit map to indicate what is present in the data, so that
   alternate marking filed can be included in the IOAM edge-to-edge
   option.  This provides a way for an end to end deployment for the
   alternate marking method.

   Since the IOAM edge-to-edge option data is not able to be interpreted
   by the intermediate node, alternate marking method cannot be applied
   within the path hop by hop with this encapsulation way.

2.2.  Use the PostCard based Telemetry Header

   The PostCard Base Telemetry (PBT)
   [I-D.song-ippm-postcard-based-telemetry] is proposed to directly
   exports the telemetry data to a collector through separated OAM
   packets called postcards, while not require inserting telemetry data
   into user packets.  The alternate making data can also be
   encapsulated in this option header.  Different from the IOAM edge-to-
   edge option, the PostCard based Telemetry facilitates the hop by hop
   deployment of alternate marking method.

2.3.  Encapsulate within the Transport Directly

   In addition to the previous ways which carry the alternate marking
   filed within the existing generic OAM header.  The alternate marking
   field can also be encapsulate within the transport protocol directly
   as an extension header or so.  This may vary according to the
   transport protocol.

3.  Encapsulating Alternate Marking Field

3.1.  Encapsulate with the End to End IOAM

   The IOAM-E2E-Type filed within the IOAM edge-to-edge option header is
   a 16-bit identifier which specifies which data types are used in the
   E2E option data.  The IOAM-E2E-Type value is a bit field, in which
   bit 0-3 are currently defined by [I-D.ietf-ippm-ioam-data].  So one
   bit from bit 4-15 can be used to indicate the presence of data used
   for alternate marking.

   The alternate marking data is a 8-octet field defined as follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+---------------------------+-------------------------------+
   |L|D|       Reserved            |            FlowID             |
   +-+-+---------------------------+-------------------------------+
   |                        FlowID(contd)                          |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   where:

   o  L - Loss flag as defined in [RFC8321];

   o  D - Delay flag as defined in [RFC8321];

   o  FlowID - 6-octet unsigned integer.  Flow identifier field is to
      uniquely identify a monitored flow within the in-situ OAM domain.
      The field is set at the engress node.  The FlowID can be uniformly
      assigned by the central controller or algorithmically generated by
      the engress node.  The latter approach cannot guarantee the
      uniqueness of FlowID, yet the conflict probability is small due to
      the large FlowID space.

3.2.  Encapsulate with the PostCard Base Telemetry

   The following figures sho ws a proposed change to the Telemetry
   Information Header (TIH) [I-D.song-ippm-postcard-based-telemetry].

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +---------------+---------------+-----------+-+-+---------------+
   | Next Header   |   TIH Length  | Reserved  |L|D|   Hop Count   |
   +---------------+---------------+-----------+-+-+---------------+

   This proposes to use the two bits from the Reserved field from the
   Telemetry Information Header.

   Where:

   o  L - Loss flag as defined in [RFC8321];

   o  D - Delay flag as defined in [RFC8321].

   The Data Element Bitmap defined in the TIH is an 31-bit bitmap
   indicating the list of required data elements.  One not used bit from
   the Data Element Bitmap can be used to indicate the presence of the
   marking bits, and trigger the statistic process.

4.  Implementing Multipoint Alternate Marking

   There are some considerations to do on how to manage the general
   Multipoint Alternate Marking application in order to get more
   adaptable performance measurement.

   [I-D.ietf-ippm-multipoint-alt-mark] introduces the network clustering
   approach for Alternate Marking: the network clusters partition can be
   done at different levels to perform the needed degree of detail.  The
   Network Management can use an intelligent strategy: it can start
   without examining in depth, and, in case of problems (i.e.  measured
   packet loss or too high delay), various filtering criteria can be
   specified in order to perform a detailed analysis by using different
   combination of clusters or, at the limit, a per-flow measurement.

4.1.  IOAM vs PBT

   Both IOAM and PBT can easily include the base Alternate Marking
   method.  But the more general implementation of Multipoint Alternate
   Marking, described in [I-D.ietf-ippm-multipoint-alt-mark], needs a
   centralized Data Collector and Network Management to allow the
   intelligent and flexible Alternate Marking algorithm.  For this
   purpose, the PostCard based Telemetry Header can really be useful.

   [I-D.song-ippm-postcard-based-telemetry] introduces the architecture
   to directly export the telemetry data from network nodes to a
   collector through separated OAM packets called postcards.

   The overall architecture of PBT and the closed loop between Nodes,
   Telemetry Data Collector and Network Management enables exactly the
   application of the network clustering approach for Alternate Marking.
