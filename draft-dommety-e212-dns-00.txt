Abstract

    An  E212 number or IMSI  (International  Mobile Station Identity) is
    used to uniquely identify a mobile station Internationally. This
    document discusses the use of the Domain Name System (DNS) for
    storage of information regarding E.212 numbers and  how DNS can be
    used for identifying available services connected to one E.212
    number. This draft is adaptation of RFC 2916 to E.212 numbers.

Internet Draft            E.212 number and DNS                June, 2000


1. Introduction

    An  E212 number or  IMSI (International  Mobile Station  Identity) is
    used to  uniquely identify  a mobile station  Internationally.
    Through transformation of E.212 numbers into DNS names and the use of
    existing DNS services like delegation through NS records, and use of
    NAPTR [1] records in DNS [2] [3], one can look up what services are
    available for a specific domain name in a decentralized way with
    distributed  management  of  the  different levels  in  the  lookup
    process. This  document discusses  the use of  the Domain  Name
    System (DNS) for storage  of information regarding E.212 numbers  and
    how DNS can be used for identifying available services connected to a
    E.212 number. This document is very similar to the RFC 2916.


1.1 Terminology

    The key  words   "MUST", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD",  "RECOMMENDED",  and
    "MAY" in this document are  to be interpreted  as described in
    RFC2119 [4].

2. E.212 numbers and DNS

     This document discusses the use of the Domain Name System (DNS) for
    storage of information regarding E.212 numbers and  how DNS can be
    used for identifying and obtaining information  related to an E.212
    number.

    The domain "e212.arpa" is being populated in order to provide the
    infrastructure in DNS for storage of E.212 numbers. In order to
    facilitate distributed operations, this domain is divided into
    subdomains. Just like in normal DNS operations, holders of E.212
    numbers which want to be listed in DNS should contact the appropriate
    zone administrator in order to be listed, by examining the SOA
    resource record associated with the zone. As with other domains,
    policies for such listings will be controlled on a subdomain basis
    and may differ in different parts of the world.

    To find the DNS names for a specific E.212 number, the following
    procedure is to be followed:

            1.  See  that the  E.212 number  is written  in its  full
    form (MCC (Mobile Country  Code) ,  MNC (Mobile Network  Code) and
    MSIN (Mobile Subscriber Identification Number).  Example:
    404984809514412

             2.  Remove all non-digit characters and characters with the
    with the exception of the digits.

            3.  Put dots (".") between each digit.  Example:
    4.0.4.9.8.4.8.0.9.5.1.4.4.1.2

            4.  Reverse the order of the digits.  Example:
    2.1.4.4.1.5.9.0.8.4.8.9.4.0.4

            5.  Append the string ".e212.arpa" to the end.  Example:
    2.1.4.4.1.5.9.0.8.4.8.9.4.0.4.e212.arpa


3. Fetching URIs given an E.212 number

    For a record in DNS, the NAPTR record is used for identifying
    available  ways  of  contacting  a  specific  node  and  associated
    services identified  by that  name [1]. Use  of NAPTR records  for
    the obtaining  URIs   associated  with  E.164  numbers   is
    speficied  in [6]. The  same service  E2U can be  used to obtain
    URIs associated with E.212  addresses by  using an DNS  name
    corrosponding to  a E.212 number instead of a E.164 number as
    specified in [6].



4. IANA Considerations

    This memo requests that the IANA delegate the E212.ARPA domain
    following instructions to be provided by the IAB.  Names within this
    zone are to be delegated to parties according to the ITU
    recommendation E.212.  The names allocated should be hierarchic in
    accordance with ITU Recommendation E.212, and the codes should
    assigned in accordance with that Recommendation.

    Delegations in the zone e212.arpa (not delegations in delegated
    domains of e212.arpa) should be done after Expert Review, and the
    IESG will appoint a designated expert.


5. Security Considerations

    As this system is built on top of DNS, one can not be sure that the
    information obtained from DNS is more secure than any DNS query. To
    solve this problem, the use of DNSSEC [7] for securing and verifying
    zones is recommended.

    The caching in DNS can make the propagation time for a change take
    the same amount of time as the time to live for the NAPTR records in
    the zone that is changed. The use of this in an environment where
    IP-addresses are for hire (for example, when using DHCP [9]) must

    therefore be done very carefully.

    There are a number of countries (and other numbering environments) in
    which there are multiple providers of call routing and number/name
    translation services.  In these areas, any system that permits users,
    or putative agents for users, to change routing or supplier
    information may provide incentives for changes that are actually
    unauthorized (and, in some cases, for denial of legitimate change
    requests).  Such environments should be designed with adequate
    mechanisms for identification and authentication of those requesting
    changes and for authorization of those changes.

6. Funny Note

    One of the ideas was to have a one line draft that said "replace
    "E.164" by E.212 and "e164" by "e212" in [6] to transform  E.212
    numbers into DNS names.

7. Acknowledgements

    The document is based on [6]  and would like to thank Patrik
    Faltstrom for consenting  to use  text from  [6].  We would  also
    like  to thank Michel Young  and Tim Stammers for the disccussing
    involving this and various other solutions.
