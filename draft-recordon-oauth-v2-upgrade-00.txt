Internet-Draft      OAuth 2.0 Token Upgrade Extension           Jul 2010


1.  Introduction

   This extension defines an assertion format as described in section
   4.1.3 of [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT',
   'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Assertion Request

   The client will make a request to the authorization server as
   described in section 4.1.3 of [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2] with the following
   parameters:

   assertion_type
      REQUIRED. "http://oauth.net/token/1.0"

   assertion
      REQUIRED.  The OAuth 1.0 token and token secret to be upgraded as
      a JSON object with the keys `token` and `token_secret`.

   client_id
      REQUIRED.  The client identifier as described in Section 2 of
      [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].

   client_secret
      REQUIRED.  The client secret as described in Section 2 of
      [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].

   For example, the client makes the following HTTP request using
   transport-layer security:

 POST /token HTTP/1.1
 Host: server.example.com
 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

 grant_type=assertion&
 assertion_type=http%3A%2F%2Foauth.net%2Ftoken%2F1.0&
 assertion=%7B'token'%3A'rjmaGaw9ATW'%2C'token_secret'%3A'OgFcfEjBR'%7D&
 client_id=8eSEIpnqmM&
 client_secret=s6BhdRkqt3

3.  Assertion Response

   The authorization server MUST validate the client credentials, token,
   and token secret.  If they are all valid, the authorization server
   issues an access token response as described in Section 4.2 of
   [I-D.ietf.oauth-v2].  The new access token SHOULD have the same
   expiration and scope as the OAuth 1.0 token which the client is
   upgrading.


4.  Security Considerations

   No additional considerations beyond those described within the OAuth
   2.0 Protocol.
