m= line has other means to deal with connection reestablishment. The
m= line, the offerer MUST use the same connid value for the m= line.
m= line will have a new connid value for this m=line.

m= line.
      Note that the SDP direction attribute (e.g., a=sendonly) deals
      with the media sent over the transport-connection, but has no
      impact on the transport-connection itself.
