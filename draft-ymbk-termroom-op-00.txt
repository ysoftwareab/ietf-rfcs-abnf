0. Abstract

   Creating and running the 'terminal room' for an IETF meeting is
   tantamount to building, running, and dismantling a small computer
   center.  Although this is a well-known area of operations, the unique
   environment and its ephemeral nature warrant passing on the lore in a
   mildly organized fashion.  It is expected that this document will be
   updated regularly.

   As the IETF can ill afford failure of these facilities, it is assumed
   that the host and organizers have the experience and resources to
   build such environments, understand power facilities, cabling, LAN
   building, workstation provisioning, etc.  So this document does not
   attempt to detail how to build computer facilities or carry out
   prudent project management.  Rather it concentrates on the unique
   aspects of the IETF 'terminal room'.

INTERNET-DRAFT  IETF Meeting Network Infrastructure Lore        99.06.16

1. External Network Connectivity

   The picky and analytic nature of a large number of IETF participants
   means that the connectivity and performance of that connectivity will
   be measured, whined about, ...  Not to worry.  Move the packets well,
   and the nit pickers with pick each other to death.

   1.1 Bandwidth consumption is approximately 5kbps per attendee.  So
       currently 10mbps of external connectivity seems sufficient.
       Unicast peaks at about five, and multicast at three.  The
       addition of streaming services may require more bandwidth.

   1.2 If possible, diverse physical and logical paths should be
       provided.  It is understood that few conference centers have
       connectivity, let alone diversity.  But it is prudent to
       coordinate with the ISP to get as much redundancy as reasonably
       possible.  Redundant and diverse paths out of the local ISP's POP
       are advised when possible.

   1.3 It has been suggested that multicast WAN connectivity would
       benefit from being separated from unicast.  This has been tried
       and worked, though it is not believed to be necessary.

2. The Internal Network

   This has been the transport area of most concern at recent meetings.

   2.1 As they seem to interfere with each other, at least three
       separately routed LAN segments should be used for the terminal
       room, radio modems, and multicast.  In particular, the high speed
       multicast feed exceeds the capacity of the radio modems, and
       therefore MUST be separate.

   2.2 The registration desk SHOULD be provisioned to accommodate three
       or four laptop users.

   2.3 Two of the meeting rooms MUST be provisioned for multicasting.
       The IETF Secretariat will specify which shortly before setup.

   2.4 A scattering of power outlets in all meeting rooms is much
       appreciated by laptop-based attendees.

   2.5 Drops to connect the radio modem base stations SHOULD be supplied
       at strategic locations throughout the facility.  The primary
       targets should be large gathering areas with seating, e.g. the
       lobby and bar.  Also all meeting rooms SHOULD have radio coverage
       if at all possible.

3. Network Services

   A lot of stress is put on DHCP, printing, and ...

   3.1 Laptops users outnumber users needing desktop UNIX and/or MS-
       Windows platforms.  Currently one terminal room 10baseT drop per
       15 attendees is comfortable.  10baseT is sufficient, as 10base2
       has all but disappeared.

   3.2 DCHP should be provided by a very standards-conformant server.
       Wide or ISC DHCP running on a UNIX platform is strongly
       recommended until non-UNIX DHCP servers have demonstrated better
       compatibility.  The address pool MUST be large enough to avoid
       shortages given constant connection churn.

   3.3 A pool of address for static assignment to laptop users without
       DHCP is necessary for approximately one client per 100 attendees.
       There should be a mechanism at the help desk to allocate and
       register their use.  Providing for allocation by email before the
       meeting is kind to those with serious security issues at home.

   3.4 Printer services are very like those in a small computer center.
       Two paper printers are needed, and a third for spare is
       advisable.  The printing rate is about .05 PPM / attendee, and an
       attendee prints approximately 15 pages during the meeting.

       One transparency printer is also needed.  The transparency
       printing rate is about .01 PPM / attendee, and an attendee prints
       approximately 1.5 pages during the meeting.

       Macs and MS-Windows systems need a spooling server, either samba-
       or NT-based.

   3.5 The cost of transparencies and their tendency to jam printers
       often warrants manual queue operation.  It is kind to train a
       local a nocturnal denizen or two in queue running to reduce
       whining at three in the morning.

   3.6 Consider splitting the UNIX server functions over more than one
       machine.  Print spooling or X duty may bog down a single server.
       Consider one server for print queue and Xhost, another for DHCP
       and SMTP relay and DNS caching.  Isolate the critical and non-
       critical server functions on different machines so a non-critical
       function, like print queuing, if it stalls or hangs the machine,
       won't stop DHCP and DNS.

   3.7 The help desk should be staffed from early morning to late
       evening by people of patience and clue.  As many attendees are
       rather experienced, their questions can be rather technical.  Of
       course, like the typical user population, they also have less
       sophisticated needs and temperaments.  An emergency contact
       number should be available when the help desk is not staffed.

   3.8 A small stash of office supplies such as staplers, tape, markers,
       etc. is often much appreciated.  It has been suggested that a
       lively market could develop in RJ48 adapters, RJ11 kits, etc.

4. Computer Systems

   There seems to be a general preference for both UNIX and MS-Windows
   platforms, though there have been successful terminal rooms with only
   one or the other.  Many users are agnostic.  But UNIX and Linux
   bigotry is increasing, and some folk need Microsoft Office to prepare
   presentations.

   Approximately one workstation per twenty attendees seems comfortable.

   Some months before the meeting, the IETF Secretariat gives the local
   host an estimate of the number of attendees.

   4.1 The software needed on all desktops is minimally: a web browser
       and an ssh client.  X-Windows is desirable on MS-Windows hosts,
       and contributes to OS indifference.

   4.2 A dozen desktops with MS-Windows and presentation tools is needed
       by those very few <smirk> working on presentations at the last
       moment in full panic.

   4.3 Air conditioning for the terminal room should be sufficient for
       the time of year, the heat load from the machines, and a lot
       people.

5. Documentation

   As the users' needs mature, so do their expectations of
   documentation.

   5.1 Some weeks before the meeting, the network prefixes to be used
       should be announced on the IETF list.  This allows users with
       security issues to have their home networks adjusted if
       necessary.

   5.2 A single-page document is included in the attendees' registration
       packets explaining the network layout, addressing, workstation
       facilities, printing facilities, etc.

   5.3 A short presentation is usually given at the opening session.

   5.4 A full on-site mirror of the RFC and I-D directories will lower
       demand on the circuits as well as the associated servers.

6. Security Considerations

   As in most computer facilities, physical as well as network security
   are important.

   6.1 Physical security is difficult, with attendees walking in and out
       with laptops and other gear at all hours.  The hired guards
       should be told to expect strange things, but to not let large
       equipment walk out without a green badge.

   6.2 Network security is traditional, see the Site Security Handbook
       [RFC2196].  The IETF network has been attacked from the outside a
       number of times.

   6.3 Secure on-site storage for boxes and equipment makes life a lot
       easier.
