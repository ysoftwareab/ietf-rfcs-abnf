Abstract

   The DNS naming conventions specified in RFC 2782 are extended to

INTERNET-DRAFT    SRV Location of Higher Level Serives      October 2003


1. Introduction

   RFC 2782 specifies a DNS SRV Resource Record for the location of
   services. In addition, it provides a DNS naming convention for the
   DNS nodes at which such SRV RRs are stored. That is the form
        _Service._Proto.name.example
   as the name of the DNS node at which SRV RRs would be stored for
   obtaining the "Service" from "name.example".

   While there are a variety of means for locating higher level
   application services, some such services may wish to use the SRV RR.
   Such higher level services would, typically, be provided over the
   sorts of services that the RFC 2782 syntax is designed to specify.
   This document extends that syntax so that higher level protocols can
   be specified.



2. Specification

   SRV RRs can be stored at nodes with names of the following form
        _Higher._Service._Proto.name.example
   For example
        _iotp._http._tcp.example.net.

   The definition of the "_Proto" DNS label is the same as in RFC 2782.

   For the use described in this document, the "_Service" DNS label is a
   port specifying token registered with IANA in Assigned Numbers (such
   as http or ldap), prefixed with an underscore character.

   The DNS label "_Higher" is a token consisting from 1 to 12 ASCII
   letters and digits, registered as provided in Section 4 below, and
   prefixed with an underscore character.

   Higher level protocols sometimes have a number of services. To
   minimize the burden on the registration authority and maximize
   convenience to the protocol specifier, "Higher" MAY also consist of a
   token (as registered hereunder) followed by a hyphen character,
   followed by any characters allowed in connection with location of the
   higher level service. For example
        _xkms-xkiss-soap._http._tcp.example.org.

   Neither this specification nor registration hereunder implies over
   what services or protocols a higher level service can be used. Such
   limitations are specified in connection with that higher level
   service. For example, you need to look at the IOTP related
   specification for any information as to whether
        _iotp._smtp._sctp.foo.example
   could be useful.

   Due to the case insensitive nature of DNS labels [RFC 1035, case],
   all of "_Higher", "_Service", and "_Proto" are case insensitive.



3. International Considerations

   The fully qualified DNS names discussed in this document and the
   Higher, Service, and Proto tokens appearing therein will normally be
   program generated and not seen by users. Thus no internationalization
   provisions are made.



4. IANA Considerations

   IANA will maintain a registry of higher level application designating
   tokens for use as specified in Section 2 above. The initial contents
   of the registry will be the two tokens

        IOTP - [RFC 2801, 2935bis]
        XKMS - [XML XKMS]

   Registration of additional tokens is based on the documentation of
   each token in an RFC or a similar free publicly accessible and
   reproducable document. To minimize the burden on the registry
   maintainer and maximize interoperability and convenience for the
   protocol specifier, such registration is to be taken as automatically
   incorporating later free publicly accessible and reproducable
   versions or amendments to the initial registration basis document by
   the entity with change control over the higher level service
   specification. To the extent reasonable, only a single token should
   be registered for a family of related higher level protocols or
   protocol versions that are under common control. The mechanism
   specified in Section 2 for extending such a token should be used,
   where needed, to distinguish variations for location purposes.

   Registration, control, and documentation of a higher level service
   token's extensions is not the concern of IANA unless an IESG approved
   RFC creates an IANA registration for that token's extenstions.



5. Security Considerations

   The security considerations as essentially the same as in RFC 2782.
