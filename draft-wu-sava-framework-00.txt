1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The lack of source IP address checking makes the Internet easy for
   the attackers to spoof the source address
   [I-D.sava-problem-statement].  The proposed "Source Address
   Validation Architecture" is chartered to specify standardization of
   methods for building effective source-address validation to ensure
   that packets forwarded hold authentic source addresses.


3.  Overview

   The SAVA framework consists of forwording components and control
   components.


4.  Forwarding Component

4.1.  uRPF

   A reverse path forwarding check component.

4.2.  Signature

   A component inserts signature into the departing packet.

4.3.  Verification

   A component checks the signature in the received packet


5.  Control Component

5.1.  Generation and Distribution of Validation Rules

   A component generates validation rules and distributes the rules to
   other control components.

5.2.  Generation and Distribution of Authentication Information

   A component generates authentication information and distributes the
   information to other control components.


6.  Framework Granularity

   We can't expect that single mechanism can solve the source address
   spoofing problem in the Internet.  Multiple mechanisms should coexist
   and cooperate.  Since the Internet is organized as a hierarchical
   architecture, it is natural to consider organizing the SAVA
   mechanisms in a hierarchical way, too.  We suggest to organize the
   SAVA mechanisms in the following three levels:

6.1.  Provider-Provider

   The goal of this level is to achieve that the packet transmitted in
   the Internet originates from the right AS that owns the source
   address of the packet.  The granularity to check at this level is
   address prefix.

   SPM is designed to work at this level.  SAVE can also be modified to
   work at this level.

   The inter-AS level is the most important for the SAVA architecture.
   The inter-AS source address spoofing is the most difficult to handle.

6.1.1.  Description

   The Internet is a conglomeration of autonomous systems (AS) that
   define the administrative authority and the routing policies of
   different organizations[11].  From this viewpoint, Internet is a
   hierarchical architecture with two levels: the first level is the
   relationship between AS; the second level is the relationship inside
   one AS.

   For a given address prefix assigned already, there should be an AS
   that owns this prefix and be responsible for this prefix.

   At the inter-AS level, only the packet transmitted between different
   AS is considered.  The packet only transmitted inside one AS is not
   considered.

   Here we list the possible source address spoofing scenario at the
   inter-AS level:





Wu, et al.               Expires August 11, 2007                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               SAVA Framework                February 2007


   1.  The host in one AS sends packet with spoofed source address of
       another AS.  This packet is sent to a destination not in the
       sending AS.

   The goal of the inter-AS SAVA mechanisms is to achieve:

   1.  The packet transmitted in the Internet should originate from the
       right AS that owns the source address of the packet.

   2.  A packet should not originates from an AS that does not own the
       source address of the packet.

   3.  For a packet transmitted in the Internet, it should be able to
       find which AS is responsible for the packet from the source
       address of the packet.

6.1.2.  Presentation of Prefix Ownership

   Here we discuss how to present the ownership of prefix for an AS.
   Since Longest Prefix Match is applied in the current forwarding
   lookup method, in the presentation of the prefix ownership we should
   also notice this property.  For An AS (e.g., AS-1) that owns a large
   address block (e.g., a.b.0.0/16), it may assign part of its address
   (e.g., a.b.c.0/24) to another AS (e.g., AS-2).  Both AS-1 and AS-2
   have global AS number.  In this case, this small address block (i.e.,
   a.b.c.0/24) is not owned by AS-1, but owned by AS-2.  So for an AS to
   express its own prefix, it should present not only the prefix
   blocksthat owned by this AS, but also those small prefix blocks that
   are not owned by this AS.

   The prefix ownership of an AS can be expressed in a table.  The entry
   in the table can be organized as:

   o  Prefix: prefix address.

   o  Prefix length: length of the prefix.

   o  Flag: whether the prefix is owned by this AS.  If the prefix is
      owned by the AS, the flag is YES; if the prefix is not owned by
      the AS, the flag is NO.

6.1.3.  Discussion

   Several important points should be kept in mind in the design of
   inter-AS SAVA mechanisms:

   1.  Asymmetric routing.  Asymmetric routing is not rare for the
       inter-AS routing.  So some methods (e.g., uRPF) by simply

Internet-Draft               SAVA Framework                February 2007


       reversing the forwarding table are not suitable.

   2.  Support for site multihoming.  Many AS are created to support
       site multihoming.  The inter-AS SAVA mechanisms should not break
       the usage of site multihoming.

   3.  High bandwidth.  Usually the inter-AS bandwidth is high.  The
       inter-AS SAVA mechanisms should be high performance.

   4.  Incremental deployment.  It's hard to ask all ASes in the
       Internet to deploy some mechanism over one night, the inter-AS
       SAVA mechanisms should be effective even with partial deployment.

   5.  Deployemnt incentive.  Since organizations behind each AS have
       their own different interest, the inter-AS SAVA mechanisms should
       provide enough incentive for the deployment.

   6.  By-passing traffic.  Inside a transit AS, there are by- passing
       traffic and its own originated traffic.  These two types of
       traffic should be discriminated.

6.2.  Sub-Provider-Sub-Provider

   The goal of this level is to achieve that the packet in its sending
   AS originates from the right sub-part of this AS which owns the
   source address of the packet.  The granularity to check at this level
   is address prefix.  Ingress filtering and uRPF can be applied at this
   level.

6.2.1.  Description

   At the Intra-AS, we only consider how to support SAVA in the sending
   AS of the packet.  The packet may be sent to a destination in the
   sending AS, or to a destination out of the sending AS.

   To better manage the network, it is possible to further divide one AS
   to some parts in a sub level.  Each sub part owns part of the AS
   address prefix, and be responsible for its own prefix.

   The possilbe source address spoofing scenarios at intra-AS level are
   as follows:

   1.  A host sends packet with spoofed source address of other part of
       AS.  This packet is sent to a destination not in the sending AS.

   2.  A host sends packet with spoofed source address of other part of
       AS.  This packet is sent to a destination in the sending AS.

Internet-Draft               SAVA Framework                February 2007


   3.  A host sends packet with spoofed source address of other AS.
       This packet is sent to a destination not in the sending AS.
       While this packet is transmitted inside the sending AS, it is an
       intra-AS problem; when the packet arrives at the border of the
       sending AS, or the packet is transmitted not in the sending AS,
       it is an inter-AS problem.

   4.  A host sends packet with spoofed source address of other AS.
       This packet is sent to a destination in the sending AS.

   The goal of the intra-AS SAVA mechanisms is to achieve:

   1.  In the sending AS of a packet, the packet should not have the
       source address that does not belong to the sending AS.

   2.  In the sending AS of a packet, if the source address of the
       packet belongs to the sending AS, the packet should originate
       from the right sub-part of this AS which owns the source address
       of the packet.

   3.  In the sending AS of a packet, if the source address of the
       packet belongs to the sending AS, a packet should not originates
       from the sub-part that does not own the source address of the
       packet.

   4.  In the sending AS of a packet, if the source address of the
       packet belongs to the sending AS, it should be able to find which
       sub-part of the AS is responsible for the packet from the source
       address of the packet.

   The by-passing traffic in the transit AS is not considered in the
   design of intra-AS SAVA mechanism.

6.2.2.  Discussion

   There are several good points for designing the intra-AS SAVA
   mechanisms:

   1.  The unified control.  Usually an AS is controlld by one
       organization.  It is easy to make a unified consideration for the
       deployment of the intra-AS SAVA mechanism.

   2.  In the intra-AS level, SAVA mechanisms only check the source
       address in the granularity of address prefix.  Checking in
       smaller granularity is left to do in the access network level.

   3.  Usually the provider assigns an address block to the customer
       network and provides a link to it.  In this case, it is a very

       effective way for the provider to apply ingress filtering at the
       provider side interface.

           ----------         ----------       ----------
       (postamble)

   In some cases, a customer network may have more than one link to the
   provider to support site multihoming.  Since the address block used
   by the customer network is only owner by one provider, it is still
   feasible to use ingress filtering here.

                   ----------
   (postamble)If the customer network has links to more than one
   providers to support site multihoming, the customer network should
   have a global AS number.  In this case, it is no longer an intra-AS
   SAVA problem, but an inter-AS SAVA problem.

6.3.  Inside Access Network

   The goal of this level is to achieve that the packet sent from the
   access network originates from the right host which owns the source
   address of the packet.  The source address may be assigned to the
   host in a static way or a dynamic way, in a "legal" way.  Some
   products have provides solutions at this level, based on binding
   between port and source IP address, or binding between MAC address
   and source IP address.

6.3.1.  Description

   A number of hosts may access the Internet via the same interface of a
   layer-3 gateway.  The host acquires its IP address in a "legal" way,
   e.g., static assigned by the administrator, or dynamic assigned by a
   DHCP server.  Suppose ingress filtering is deployed at this
   interface.  If there is no special consideration, one host can still
   spoof source address by sending packet with the "legal" IP address of
   other host, or even with the IP address not owned by this access
   network.  The goal of the access network SAVA mechanisms is to solve
   the source address spoofing problem in these two scenarios.

   "Access network" is a very widely used concept, and it has many
   different scenarios.  We just use this phrase here to indicate the
   specific scenario we describe above.

   (postamble)The possilbe source address spoofing scenarios at access
   network level are as follows:

   1.  A host sends packet with spoofed source address of other host in
       the same access network.  This packet is sent to a destination
       not in the same access network.

   2.  A host sends packet with spoofed source address not owned by the
       access network.  This packet is sent to a destination not in the
       same access network.  Before the packet passes through the
       interface of layer-3 gateway, it is a access network level
       problem.

   3.  A host sends packet with spoofed source address of other host in
       the same access network.  This packet is sent to a destination in
       the same access network.

   4.  A host sends packet with spoofed source address not owned by the
       access network.  This packet is sent to a destination in the same
       access network.

   We classify the goal of SAVA mechanisms at access network level into
   types: Loose Check scenario, and Strict Check scenario.

   In the Loose Check scenario, the SAVA mechanism should support:

   o  The packet originating from the access network that can pass
      through the layer-3 gateway should originate from the right host
      that owns the source address of the packet.

   In the Strict Check scenario, in additional to the requirement in the
   Loose Check scenario, the SAVA mechanism should also support:

   o  The packet originating from the access network that can be receive
      by other hosts in the same access network should originate from
      the right host that owns the source address of the packet.

6.3.2.  Discussion

   Currently, a common way to support access network level SAVA is to
   allocate each host with seperate port at a layer-2 or layer-3 switch.

           |          |                |

        |Host|      |Host|    ...    |Host|
        +----+      +----+           +----+
   (postamble)With layer-3 switch, the assigned IP address is binded
   with some specific port of the switch.  Only the packet with the
   assigned source address can be sent through the port.  It can meet
   the requirement of Strict Check scenario.

   With layer-2 switch, the assigned IP address is binded with the MAC
   address of the host, and this binding is checked by the layer-3
   gateway.  The layer-2 switch should support the binding between MAC
   address and the port of the layer-2 switch.  Thus, it is achieved the
   binding between the assigned IP address and the port of the layer-2
   switch.  But it can only meet the requirement of Loose Check
   scenario.

7.  Design Goals

7.1.  Solution Focussed on IPv6

   Much if not all of the problem statement applies equally to IPv4 as
   to IPv6.  However, the decision has been taken in this effort to
   focus on IPv6 only.  This is because there are many changes that can
   still be made to IPv6 that cannot be made to IPv4.  If a solution
   designed under this framework is also applicable to IPv4, or can be
   modified to work with IPv4, then that is considered to be good, but
   it is not a design goal.

7.2.  Performance

   Any solutions designed under this framework should be no more taxing
   on routing and other infrastructure than the application of BCP038.
   That is, modern routing equipment should be able to maintain full
   line rate.

   It is permissable to propose solutions that are not fully achievable
   with current equipment "as-is" but would be implementable with
   current generation technology, as long as alternative solutions are
   available for current equipment.  (See Section 6.7).

7.3.  Scaling

   Solutions must be capable of scaling to the size of the global
   Internet.

7.4.  Multi-granularity ("Multi-Fence") solution

   One of the reasons why BCP has not solved the problem is that it is a
   single granularity solution - it can only be applied in the access
   network, or at the boundary between a stub/access network and a

   transit network.  A provider who applies BCP038 protects itself from
   its own clients, and the rest of the Internet from its clients but it
   does not protect itself from spoofed packets in the rest of the
   Internet in any way.

   A multi-granularity solution will allow a network to assign levels of
   trust to the source addresses on packets sent from neighboring
   providers as well as from its own network and attached stub networks.

7.5.  Incrementally Deployable

   The mechanism should show its benefit even if it is deployed only in
   part of the Internet.  It is impossible to deploy some mechanism all
   over the Internet in one night.  If there is no benefit for partial
   deployment, it is hard to start the deployment.

7.6.  Incomplete Deployment Still Beneficial

   The mechanism should have direct benefit to the party who makes
   investment on the deployment of the mechanism.  Otherwise there is
   not enough incentive for someone to spend money to deploy such
   mechanism.

   This implies two things: first, there must be immediate benefit for
   incomplete deployment, and deploying the recommended solutions must
   provide some protection to the entity deploying the solutions.

7.7.  Loose Component Coupling

   A solution that meets the above design goals will have components for
   each level of granularity.  It is desired that a solution under this
   framework may have more than one solution at any given level of
   granularity.  This allows for different providers to use different
   solutions, as well as allowing for evolution of new solutions as the
   capabilities of equipment improve or simply as new solutions are
   developed.

   This requires the coupling of components at different levels of
   granularity to be loose enough to allow component substitution.
