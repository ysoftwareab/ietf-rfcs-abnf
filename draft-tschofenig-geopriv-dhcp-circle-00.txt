Abstract

   This document specifies how a circular area representing the location
   of device can be returned using DHCP.  The document also shows how
   the data returned from DHCP can be encoded into GML for using in a
   PIDF-LO in an unambiguous or contentious manner.

   This document is a contribution to the ongoing discussion on RFC
   3825; it represents one possible solution to address the discussed
   issues.

Internet-Draft             DHCP Location Area              February 2008


1.  Introduction

   Location provided by GPS device and like generally provide location
   information as a point with a degree of uncertainty.  This
   uncertainty is more often than not expressed as an offset in metres
   from the central point, with the resulting location being a circle
   when expressed in 2 dimensions, and a sphere when expressed in 3
   dimensions.  This memo presupposes that locations have been measured,
   for example using a GPS, ahead of time and have subsequently been
   stored in a wiremap database.  Associations between end-devices and
   location can be done using DHCP option 82 or other methods where
   appropriate.

   This document omits an altitude representation based on the
   envisioned usage scenario.

3.  Details and Rationale

   The intent of this specification is to provide a location to an end-
   device so that it can easily represent it as circle in GML in
   accordance with PIDF-LO Profile [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile].
   PIDF-LO Profile relies on geoshape [geoshape] requires all
   coordinates to be specified using WGS-84, consequently the
   coordinates used in this memo are specified using WGS-84.

   GML [gml] uses the ISO 19107 [ISO-19107] definition of a point, and
   quotes this as being "0-dimensional geometric primitive, representing
   a position.  NOTE The boundary of a point is the empty set."  At some
   point however, it becomes necessary to express the coordinates that
   make up the location in bits and bytes.  Since the intent is to use
   GML as the final representation, the encoding standards and
   limitations expressed by GML are used.

   GML is an XML language [xml] for expressing location information, and
   XML defines mappings between its primative types and standard binary
   encodings.  The GML point is made up of XML (xsd) doubles, and an XML
   double is expressed as an IEEE 754-1985 [IEEE-754-1985] double-
   precision floating point number.  This means that a latitude or
   longitude in GML is expressed as a 64 bit binary number, but in
   accordance with the previous definition is interpretted as being zero
   dimensional, without area.

   The binary encodings provided in this memo express latitude and
   longitude values as 64 bit binary floating-point numbers, as defined
   in [IEEE-754-1985].  A radius is defined as a positive offset to this
   in metres, and is expressed as an unsigned 16 bit integer.  This
   allows a circle with a radius in the order of 65.5km to be expressed
   without difficulty, and for a point with no specified uncertainty to
   be provided where the radius is set to zero.

3.1.  DHCPv4 Option for a Circular Location

   This section defines a DHCP for IPv4 (DHCPv4) option for the point
   with radius of uncertainty.

4.  Expressing the Circle in GML

   PIDF-LO Profile [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pdif-lo-profile] describes how a
   circle is expressed in GML and included in a PIDF-LO [RFC4119].  The
   latitude and longitude components of this encoding form the central
   point of the circle.

   The XML for the resulting circle is shown in Figure 4 (assuming the
   centre is represented as 42.5463 -73.2512) and the radius is 5
   meters.

7.  Acknowledgements

   The authors contribute this document to the ongoing discussion in the
   GEOPRIV working group.  Still, the authors believe that it would be
   necessary to investigate the intended deployment use cases more in
   order to evaluate what additional location shapes are likely to be
   used and whether there is interest in using DHCP (or lower layer
   protocols developed by the IEEE or TIA) for conveying location
   information or whether there is more interest to use these protocols
   purely to discover a LIS and allow more flexibility with regard to
   the supported location shapes.
