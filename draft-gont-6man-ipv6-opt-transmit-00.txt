              Transmission and Processing of IPv6 Options
                draft-gont-6man-ipv6-opt-transmit-00.txt

Abstract

   Various IPv6 options have been standardized since the core IPv6
   standard was first published.  This document updates RFC 2460 to
   clarify how nodes should deal with such IPv6 options and with any
   options that are defined in the future.  It complements [RFC7045],
   which offers a similar clarification regarding IPv6 Extension
   Headers.

1.  Introduction and Problem Statement

   Various IPv6 options have been standardized since the core IPv6
   standard [RFC2460] was first published.  Except for the padding
   options (Pad1 and PadN), all the options that have so far been
   specified are meant to be employed with specific IPv6 extension
   header types.  Additionally, some options have specific requirements
   such as, for example, only allowing a single instance of the option
   in the corresponding IPv6 extension header (EH).  This establishes
   some criteria for validating packets that employ IPv6 options.

   [RFC2460] specifies that IPv6 extension headers (with the exception
   of the Hop-by-Hop Options extension header) are not examined or
   processed by any node along a packet's delivery path, until the
   packet reaches the node (or each of the set of nodes, in the case of
   multicast) identified in the Destination Address field of the IPv6
   header.  However, in practice this is not really the case: some
   routers, and a variety of middleboxes such as firewalls, load
   balancers, or packet classifiers, might inspect other parts of each
   packet [RFC7045].  Hence both end-nodes an intermediate nodes may end
   up inspecting the contents of extension headers and discard packets
   based on the presence of specific IPv6 options.

   This document clarifies the default processing of IPv6 options.  In
   those cases in which the specifications add additional constraints/

   requirements regarding IPv6 options, such additional constraints/
   requirements are also taken into account.

2.  Terminology and Conventions Used in This Document

2.1.  Terminology

   In the remainder of this document, the term "forwarding node" refers
   to any router, firewall, load balancer, prefix translator, or any
   other device or middlebox that forwards IPv6 packets with or without
   examining the packet in any way.

   In this document, "standard" IPv6 options are those specified in
   detail by IETF Standards Actions [RFC5226].  "Experimental" options
   include those defined by any Experimental RFC and the option types
   0x1E, 0x3E, 0x5E, 0x7E, 0x9E, 0xBE, 0xDE, and 0xFE, defined by
   [RFC3692] and [RFC4727] when used as experimental options.  "Defined"
   options are the "standard" options plus the "experimental" ones.

   The terms "permit" (allow the traffic), "drop" (drop with no
   notification to sender), and "reject" (drop with appropriate
   notification to sender) are employed as defined in [RFC3871].
   Throughout this document we also employ the term "discard" as a
   generic term to indicate the act of discarding a packet, irrespective
   of whether the sender is notified of such packet drops.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Conventions

   This document clarifies some basic validation of IPv6 options, and
   specifies the default processing of them.  We recommend that a
   configuration option is made available to govern the processing of
   each IPv6 option type, on a per-EH-type granularity.  Such
   configuration options may include the following possible settings:

   o  Permit this IPv6 Option type

   o  Drop (and log) packets containing this IPv6 option type

   o  Reject (and log) packets containing this IPv6 option type (where
      the packet drop is signaled with an ICMPv6 error message)

   o  Rate-limit the processing of packets containing this IPv6 option
      type

Internet-Draft      Transm. and Proc. of IPv6 Options        August 2014


   o  Ignore this IPv6 option type (forwarding packets that contain
      them)

   We note that special care needs to be taken when devices log packet
   drops/rejects.  Devices should count the number of packets dropped/
   rejected, but the logging of drop/reject events should be limited so
   as to not overburden device resources.

   Finally, we note that when discarding packets, it is generally
   desirable that the sender be signaled of the packet drop, since this
   is of use for trouble-shooting purposes.  However, throughout this
   document (when recommending that packets be discarded) we generically
   refer to the action as "discard" without specifying whether the
   sender is signaled of the packet drop.

3.  Considerations for All IPv6 Options

   Forwarding nodes that discard packets (by default) based on the
   presence of IPv6 options are known to cause connectivity failures and
   deployment problems.  Any forwarding node along an IPv6 packet's
   path, which forwards the packet for any reason, SHOULD do so
   regardless of any IPv6 Destination Options that are present, as
   required by [RFC2460].  Exceptionally, if a forwarding node is
   designed to examine IPv6 Destination Options for any reason, such as
   firewalling, it MUST recognise and deal appropriately with all
   standard IPv6 options types and SHOULD recognise and deal
   appropriately with all experimental IPv6 options.  The list of
   standard and experimental option types is maintained by IANA (see
   [IANA-IPV6-PARAM]), and implementors are advised to check this list
   regularly for updates.

   In the case of some options meant to be included in IPv6 extension
   headers other than Hop-by-Hop Options, [RFC2460] requires destination
   hosts to discard the corresponding packet if the option is
   unrecognised.  However, intermediate forwarding nodes SHOULD NOT do
   this, since that might cause them to inadvertently discard traffic
   using a recently standardised IPv6 option not yet recognised by the
   intermediate node.  The exceptions to this rule are discussed next.

   If a forwarding node discards a packet containing a standard IPv6
   option, it MUST be the result of a configurable policy and not just
   the result of a failure to recognise such an option.  This means that
   the discard policy for each standard type of IPv6 option MUST be
   individually configurable.  The default configuration SHOULD allow
   all standard IPv6 options.

Internet-Draft      Transm. and Proc. of IPv6 Options        August 2014


   Experimental IPv6 options SHOULD be treated in the same way as
   standard IPv6 options, including an individually configurable discard
   policy.

   A node that processes the contents of an extension header MUST
   discard the corresponding packet if it contains any defined options
   that are not meant for the extension header being processed.

   A node that processes the contents of an IPv6 extension header SHOULD
   discard the corresponding packet if it contains any options that have
   become deprecated.

   A node that processes the contents of an extension header and
   encounters an undefined (unrecognised) IPv6 option MUST react to such
   option according to the highest-order two bits of the option type, as
   specified by Section 4.2 of [RFC2460].

   A node that processes an IPv6 extension header MAY discard a packet
   containing any experimental IPv6 options.

4.  Processing of currently-defined IPv6 Options

   The following subsections provide advice on how to process the IPv6
   options that have been defined at the time of this writing, according
   to the rules specified in the previous sections.

4.1.  Hop-by-Hop Options Header

   A node that processes the Hop-by-Hop Options extension header MUST
   discard the corresponding packet if it contains any of the following
   options in that header:

   o  Type 0x04: Tunnel Encapsulation Limit [RFC2473]

   o  Type 0xC9: Home Address [RFC6275]

   o  Type 0x8B: ILNP Nonce [RFC6744]

   o  Type 0x8C: Line-Identification Option [RFC6788]

   o  Type 0x8A: Endpoint Identification [nimrod-eid] [NIMROD-DOC]

      NOTE: The rationale for discarding packets containing these
      options is that these options are meant to be used only with the
      Destination Options header

Internet-Draft      Transm. and Proc. of IPv6 Options        August 2014


   A node that processes the Hop-by-Hop Options extension header MUST
   discard a packet containing multiple instances (i.e., more than one)
   of this option in the Hop-by-Hop Options extension header:

   o  Type 0x05: Router Alert [RFC2711]

      NOTE: The rationale for discarding the packet is that [RFC2711]
      forbids multiple instances of this option.

   A node that processes the Hop-by-Hop Options extension header MUST
   discard a packet that carries a Fragment Header and also contains
   this option in the Hop-by-Hop Options extension header:

   o  Type 0xC2: Jumbo Payload [RFC2675]

      NOTE: The rationale for discarding the packet is that [RFC2675]
      forbids the use of the Jumbo Payload Option in packets that carry
      a Fragment Header.

   A node that processes the Hop-by-Hop Options extension header SHOULD
   discard a packet containing any of the following options in that
   header:

   o  Type=0x4D: Deprecated

      NOTE: The rationale for discarding the packet is that the
      aforementioned option has been deprecated.

   A node that processes the Hop-by-Hop Options extension header MAY
   discard a packet containing any of the following options in that
   header:

   o  Type 0x1E: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0x3E: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0x5E: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0x7E: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0x9E: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0xBE: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0xDE: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0xFE: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

      NOTE: This is in line with the corresponding specification in
      [RFC7045] for experimental extension headers.

4.2.  Destination Options Header

   A node that processes the Destination Options header MUST discard a
   packet containing any of the following options in that header:

   o  Type 0x05: Router Alert [RFC2711]

   o  Type 0xC2: Jumbo Payload [RFC2675]

   o  Type 0x63: RPL Option [RFC6553]

   o  Type 0x08: SMF_DPD [RFC6621]

   o  Type 0x6D: MPL Option [I-D.ietf-roll-trickle-mcast]

   o  Type 0xEE: IPv6 DFF Header [RFC6971]

   o  Type 0x26: Quick-Start [RFC4782]

   o  Type 0x07: CALIPSO [RFC5570]

      NOTE: The rationale for discarding packets containing these
      options is that these options are meant to be used only with the
      Hop by Hop Options header.

   A node that processes the Destination Options extension header SHOULD
   discard a packet containing any of the following options in that
   header:

   o  Type 0x8A: Endpoint Identification [nimrod-eid] [NIMROD-DOC]

   o  Type 0x4D: Deprecated

      NOTE: The rationale for discarding the packet is that the
      aforementioned options have been deprecated.

   A node that processes the Destination Options extension header MAY
   discard a packet containing any of the following options in that
   header:

   o  Type 0x1E: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0x3E: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0x5E: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0x7E: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0x9E: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0xBE: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0xDE: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

   o  Type 0xFE: RFC3692-style Experiment [RFC4727]

      NOTE: This is in line with the corresponding specification in
      [RFC7045] for experimental extension headers.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add an extra column entitled "Extension Header
   Type" to the "Destination Options and Hop-by-Hop Options" registry
   [IANA-IPV6-PARAM], to clearly mark the IPv6 Extension Header for
   which each option (defined by IETF Standards Action or IESG Approval)
   is valid (see the list below).  This also applies to Destination
   Options and Hop-by-Hop Options defined in the future.

   What follows is the initial list of IPv6 options and the
   corresponding marks that indicate which Extension Header type(s)
   these IPv6 options are valid for:

6.  Security Considerations

   Forwarding nodes that operate as firewalls MUST conform to the
   requirements in this document.  In particular, packets containing
   standard IPv6 options are only to be discarded as a result of an
   intentionally configured policy.

   These requirements do not affect a firewall's ability to filter out
   traffic containing unwanted or suspect IPv6 options, if configured to
   do so.  However, the changes do require firewalls to be capable of
   permitting any or all IPv6 options, if configured to do so.  The
   default configurations are intended to allow normal use of any
   standard IPv6 option, avoiding the interoperability issues described
   in Section 1 and Section 3.

   As noted above, the default configuration might discard packets
   containing experimental IPv6 options.
