Abstract

   To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion, four top level
   domain names are reserved for use in testing and as examples in
   documentation.

INTERNET-DRAFT                                     Test and Example TLDs


1. Introduction

   The global Internet Domain Name System is documented in RFC 1034,
   1035, 1591 and numerous additional Requests for Comment.  It defines
   a tree of names starting with root, ".", immediately below which are
   top level domain names such as .com and .us. Below top level domain
   names there are normally additional levels of names.



2. TLDs for Testing and Documentation Examples

   There is a need for top level domain names that can safely be used in
   testing, as examples in documentation, and experimentation, without
   fear of conflicts with actual top level domain names in the global
   DNS.  To satisfy this need, the following four domain names are
   permanently reserved.

                   .xx
                  .nil
                 .test
              .example

   Note: two letter top level domain names are reserved for ISO 3166 /
   Universal Postal Union two letter country codes.  However, ISO 3166
   reserves "xx" for local use and states that it will never be assigned
   to a country.

   The above four names will be added to the root with a single type TXT
   RR under each.  The RDATA for these TXT RRs will contain the single
   string

        Reserved, see RFC NNNN.

   [where NNNN is the number of the RFC this draft gets issued as.]



3. Security Considerations

   Confusion and conflict can be caused by the use of a current or
   potential future top level domain name in testing, experimentation,
   or as an example in documentation.  Test and experimental software
   can escape and end up being run against the operational DNS.  Even
   examples used "only" in documentation can end up being coded and
   released or cause conflicts due to later real use and the possible
   acquisition of intellectual property rights in such "example" names.

   The reservation of several top level domain names specifically for
   these purposes will minimize such confusion and conflict.
