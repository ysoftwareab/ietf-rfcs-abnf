1.  Introduction

   This document defines the terminology for the Interface to Network
   Security Functions (I2NSF) effort.  This section provides some
   background on I2NSF; a detailed problem statement can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-problem-and-use-cases]. Motivation and comparison to
   previous work can be found in [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-gap-analysis].

   Enterprises are now considering using network security functions
   (NSFs) hosted by service providers due to the growing challenges and
   complexity in maintaining an up-to-date secure infrastructure that
   complies with regulatory requirements, while controlling costs.  The
   hosted security service is especially attractive to small- and
   medium-size enterprises who suffer from a lack of security experts
   to continuously monitor, acquire new skills and propose immediate
   mitigations to ever increasing sets of security attacks.  Small- and
   medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are increasingly adopting cloud-based
   security services to replace on-premises security tools, while larger
   enterprises are deploying a mix of traditional (hosted) and cloud-
   based security services.

   To meet the demand, more and more service providers are providing
   hosted security solutions to deliver cost-effective managed security
   services to enterprise customers.  The hosted security services are
   primarily targeted at enterprises, but could also be provided to
   mass-market customers as well.  NSFs are provided and consumed in
   increasingly diverse environments.  Users of NSFs may consume
   network security services hosted by one or more providers, which
   may be their own enterprise, service providers, or a combination
   of both.

   It is out of scope in this document to define an exhaustive list of
   terms that are used in the security field; the reader is referred to
   other applicable documents, such as [RFC4949].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. In 
   this document, these words will appear with that interpretation   
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to 
   be interpreted as carrying [RFC2119] significance.


   3.  Terminology

   AAA:  Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting.  See individual
       definitions.

   Abstraction:  The definition of the salient characteristics and
      behavior of an object that distinguish it from all other types of
      objects.  It manages complexity by exposing common properties
      between objects and processes while hiding detail that is not
      relevant.

   Access Control:  Protection of system resources against unauthorized
      access; a process by which use of system resources is regulated
      according to a security policy, and is permitted by only
      authorized entities (users, programs, processes, or other systems)
      according to that policy [RFC4949].

   Accounting:  The act of collecting information on resource usage for
      the purpose of trend analysis, auditing, billing, or cost
      allocation ([RFC2975] [RFC3539]).

   ACL (Access Control List):  This is a mechanism that implements
      access control for a system resource by enumerating the system
      entities that are permitted to access the resource and stating,
      either implicitly or explicitly, the access modes granted to each
      entity [RFC4949]. A YANG description is defined in
      [I-D.ietf-netmod-acl-model].

   Action:  Defines what is to be done when a set of Conditions are
      met (See I2NSF Action).  (from
      [I-D.ietf-supa-generic-policy-info-model]).

   Assertion:  Defined by the ITU in [X.1252] as "a statement made by
      an entity without accompanying evidence of its validity". In the
      context of I2NSF, an assertion MAY include metadata about all or
      part of the assertion (e.g., context of the assertion, or about
      timestamp indicating the point in time the assertion was
      created). The validity of an assertion cannot be verified.
      (from [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology]).

Internet-Draft              I2NSF Terminology               October 2016


  Authentication:  Defined in [RFC4949] as "the process of verifying
      a claim that a system entity or system resource has a certain
      attribute value." (from [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology]).

   Authorization:  Defined in [RFC4949] as "an approval that is granted
      to a system entity to access a system resource."
      (from [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology]).

   B2B:   Business-to-Business.

   Bespoke:  Something made to fit a particular person, customer, or
      company.

   Bespoke security management:  Security management systems that are
      make to fit a particular customer.

   Boolean Clause:  A logical statement that evaluates to either TRUE
      or FALSE.  Also called Boolean Expression.

   Capability:  Defines a set of features that are available from a
      managed entity (see also I2NSF Capability). Examples of "managed
      entities" are NSFs and Controllers, where NSF Capabilities and
      Controller Capabilities define functionality of an NSF and about
      Controller, respectively. These functions may, but do not have
      to, be used. All Capabilities are announced through the
      Registration Interface.

   Client:  See Consumer. [Editor's note: placeholder for gradually
      replacing Client with Consumer, since Client is too vague and
      has other connotations (e.g., client-server)].

   Client-Facing Interface:  See Consumer-Facing Interface.
      See also:  Interface, NSF-Facing Interface.

   Component:  An encapsulation of software that communicates using
      Interfaces. A Component may be implemented by hardware and/or
      software, and be represented using a set of classes. In general,
      a Component encapsulates a set of data structures and a set of
      algorithms that implement the function(s) that it provides.

   Consumer:  A Consumer is a Role that is assigned to an I2NSF
      Component that represents the needs of a user of I2NSF services.
      A consumer can send/receive information to/from another I2NSF
      Component (e.g., for defining and monitoring security policies
      for the Consumer's specific flows through an I2NSF
      administrative domain).  See also:  Producer, Role.

   Consumer-Facing Interface:  An Interface dedicated to communication
      with Consumers of NSF Data and Services. This is typically
      defined per I2NSF administrative domain.  See also: Interface,
      NSF-Facing Interface.

  Condition:  A set of attributes, features, and/or values that are to
      be compared with a set of known attributes, features, and/or
      values in order to make a decision.  A Condition, when used in the
      context of a Policy Rule, is used to determine whether or not the
      set of Actions in that Policy Rule can be executed or not.
      Examples of an I2NSF Condition include matching attributes of a
      packet or flow, and comparing the internal state of a NSF to a
      desired state.  (from [I-D.ietf-supa-generic-policy-info-model]).

   Constraint:  A Constraint is a limitation or restriction.
      Constraints may be associated with any type of object (e.g.,
      Events, Conditions, and Actions in Policy Rules).

   Constraint Programming:  A type of programming that uses constraints
      to define relations between variables in order to find a
      feasible (and not necessarily optimal) solution.

   Context:  The Context of an Entity is a collection of measured and/
      or inferred knowledge that describe the state and the environment
      in which an Entity exists or has existed.  (from
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/i2nsf/current/msg00762.html).

   Controller:  A Controller is a management Component that contains
      control plane functions to manage and facilitate information
      sharing, as well as execute security functions. This definition
      is based on that in [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology].

   Control Plane:  In the context of I2NSF, the Control Plane is an
      architectural Component that provides common control functions
      to all I2NSF Components, including some or all of the following:
      authentication, authorization, accounting, auditing, and
      Capability discovery and negotiation. The Control Plane
      orchestrates the operation of the Data Plane according to
      guidance and/or input from the Management Plane. I2NSF Components
      with Interfaces to the Control Plane have knowledge of the
      Capabilities of other I2NSF Components within a particular I2NSF
      administrative domain. This definition is based on that in
      [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology].  See also: Data Plane, Management
      Plane.

   Customer:  A business role of an entity that is involved in the
      definition and/or consumption of services, and the possible
      negotiation of a contract to use services from a Provider.

   DC:  Data Center

Internet-Draft              I2NSF Terminology               October 2016


   Data Model:  A representation of concepts of interest to an
      environment in a form that is dependent on data repository, data
      definition language, query language, implementation language, and
      protocol (typically one or more of these ). Note the difference
      between a data **model** and a data **structure**.
      [I-D.ietf-supa-generic-policy-info-model].

   Data Plane:  In the context of I2NSF, the Data Plane is an
      architectural Component that provides operational functions to
      enable an I2NSF Component to provide and consume packets and
      flows.  See also:  Control Plane, Management Plane.

   Data Structure:  A low-level building block that is used in
      programming to implement an algorithm. A data model typically
      contains multiple types of data structures; however, a data
      structure does not contain a data model. Note the difference
      between a data **model** and a data **structure**.

   Event:  An important occurrence in time of a change in the system
      being managed, and/or in the environment of the system being
      managed.  Examples of an I2NSF Event include time and user actions
      (e.g. logon, logoff, and actions that violate an ACL).  An Event,
      when used in the context of a Policy Rule, is used to determine
      whether the Condition clause of an imperative Policy Rule can be
      evaluated or not (from [I-D.ietf-supa-generic-policy-info-model]).

   ECA:  Event - Condition - Action (a type of Policy Rule).

   Firewall (FW):  A function that restricts data communication traffic
      to and from one of the connected networks (the one said to be
      'inside' the firewall), and thus protects that network's system
      resources against threats from the other network (the one that
      is said to be 'outside' the firewall) [RFC4949].
      [I-D.ietf-opsawg-firewalls]

   Flow:  A set of information (e.g., packets) that are related in a
      fundamental manner (e.g., sent from the same source and sent to
      the same destination). A common example is a sequence of packets.
      It is the opposite of packet-based, which treats each packet
      discretely (e.g., each packet is assessed individually to
      determine the action(s) to be taken).

  Flow-based NSF:  A NSF that inspects network flows according to a
      set of policies intended for enforcing security properties.  Flow-
      based security also means that packets are inspected in the order
      they are received, and without modification to the packet due to
      the inspection process.

   I2NSF Agent:  A software Component in a device that implements an
      NSF.  It receives provisioning information and requests for
      operational data (e.g., monitoring data) from an I2NSF Consumer.
      It is also responsible for enforcing the policies that it
      receives from an I2NSF Consumer.

   I2NSF Action:  An I2NSF Action is a special type of Action that is
      used to control and monitor aspects of flow-based Network Security
      Functions.  Examples of I2NSF Actions include providing intrusion
      detection and/or protection, web and flow filtering, and deep
      packet inspection for packets and flows.  An I2NSF Action, when
      used in the context of a I2NSF Policy Rule, may be executed when
      both the Event and the Condition clauses of its owning I2NSF
      Policy Rule evaluate to true.  The execution of this Action may be
      influenced by applicable metadata. (from
      [I-D.ietf-supa-generic-policy-info-model]).

   I2NSF Capability:  A set of features that are available from an NSF
      Server or an NSF Controller. While both are Capabilities, the
      former defines functions that are available from an NSF, whereas
      the latter defines functions that are available from a security
      Controller or other Management Entity. This definition is based
      on that in [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology].

   I2NSF Client:  See I2NSF Consumer.

   I2NSF Component:  A Component that provides one or more I2NSF
      Services. I2NSF Components are managed and communicate with other
      I2NSF Components using I2NSF Interfaces. 

   I2NSF Consumer:  A software Component that uses the I2NSF framework
      to read, write, and/or change provisioning and operational aspects
      of the NSFs that it attaches to.

   I2NSF Consumer Interface:  An Interface dedicated to requesting and
      using I2NSF Services. For example, this Interface could be used
      to request a set of Flow Security policies from an I2NSF
      Controller or from one or more individual NSFs. The difference is
      that the former uses more abstract Condition matching (e.g.,
      based on tenant or customer ID), whereas the latter uses more
      low-level Condition matching (e.g., based on flow state or fields
      in a flow or packet).  See also:  Interface, I2NSF Provider
      Interface, Client-Facing Interface, NSF-Facing Interface.

   I2NSF Management System:  I2NSF Consumers operate within the scope of
      a network management system, which serves as a collection and
      distribution point for I2NSF security provisioning.

   I2NSF Policy:  A set of Policy Rules that are used to manage and
      control the changing or maintaining of the state of an instance
      of an NSF.

Internet-Draft              I2NSF Terminology               October 2016

   I2NSF Policy Rule:  A Policy Rule that is adapted for I2NSF usage.
      The I2NSF Policy Rule is assumed to be in ECA form (i.e., an
      imperative structure).  Other types of programming paradigms
      (e.g., declarative and functional) are currently out of scope.
      An example of an I2NSF Policy Rule is, in pseudo-code:

         IF <event-clause> is TRUE
            IF <condition-clause> is TRUE
               THEN execute <action-clause>
            END-IF
         END-IF

      In the above example, the Event, Condition, and Action portions
      of a Policy Rule are all **Boolean Clauses**.

   I2NSF Provider Interface:  An Interface dedicated to providing I2NSF
      Services. For example, this could provide Anti-Virus, (D)DoS, or
      IPS Services.  See also:  Interface, I2NSF Provider Interface,
      Client-Facing Interface, NSF-Facing Interface.

   I2NSF Registry:  A registry that contains I2NSF capability
      information, which can be controlled by the I2NSF Management
      System.  See also: Registry.

   I2NSF Service:  A set of functions, provided by an I2NSF Consumer,
      which are used by zero or more I2NSF Producers. Exemplary I2NSF
      Services include Anti-Virus, Authentication, Authorization,
     (D)DoS, Firewall, and IPS Services.  See also:  Interface, I2NSF
      Provider Interface, Client-Facing Interface, NSF-Facing Interface.

   IDS:  Intrusion Detection System (see below).

   IPS:  Intrusion Protection System (see below).

   Information Model:  A representation of concepts of interest to an
      environment in a form that is independent of data repository,
      data definition language, query language, implementation language,
      and protocol [I-D.ietf-supa-generic-policy-info-model].

   Interface:  A set of operations one object knows it can invoke on,
      and expose to, another object.  It is a subset of all operations
      that a given object implements.  The same object may have multiple
      types of interfaces to serve different purposes.  An example of
      multiple interfaces can be seen by considering the interfaces
      include a firewall uses; these include:

         *  multiple interfaces for data packets to traverse through,
         *  an interface for a controller to impose policy, or retrieve
            the results of execution of a policy rule.

      See also: Consumer Interface, I2NSF Interface, Provider Interface

   Interface Group:  A set of Interfaces that are related in purpose and
      which share the same communication mechanisms.

   Intrusion Detection System (IDS):  A system that detects network
      intrusions via a variety of filters, monitors, and/or probes.  An
      IDS may be stateful or stateless.

   Intrusion Protection System (IPS):  A system that protects against
      network intrusions.  An IPS may be stateful or stateless.

   Management Plane:  In the context of I2NSF, the Management Plane is
      an architectural Component that provides common functions to
      define the behavior of I2NSF Components. The primary use of the
      Management Plane is to transport behavioral commands, and supply
      OAM data, for making decisions that affect behavior. Examples
      include modifying the configuration of an I2NSF Component and
      transporting OAM data.  See also: Control Plane, Data Plane.
   
   Metadata:  Data that provides information about other data.
      Examples include IETF network management protocols (e.g.  NETCONF,
      RESTCONF, IPFIX) or IETF routing interfaces (I2RS).  The I2NSF
      security interface may utilize Metadata to describe and/or
      prescribe characteristics and behavior of the YANG data models.

    Middlebox:  Any intermediary device performing functions other
      than the normal, standard functions of an IP router on the
      datagram path between a source host and destination host
      [RFC3234].

   Network Security Function (NSF):  Software that provides a set of
      security-related services.  Examples include detecting unwanted
      activity and blocking or mitigating the effect of such unwanted
      activity in order to fulfil service requirements.  The NSF can
      also help in supporting communication stream integrity and
      confidentiality.

   NSF-Facing Interface:  An Interface dedicated to communication with
      a set of NSFs. This is typically defined per I2NSF administrative
      domain. See also:  Interface, Consumer-Facing Interface.

   OAM:  Operation, Administrative, and Management.

   OCL (Object Constraint Language):  A constraint programming language
      that is used to specify constraints (e.g., in UML) (from
      http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/i2nsf/current/msg00762.html)

   Policy Rule:  A set of rules that are used to manage and control
      the changing or maintaining of the state of one or more managed
      objects.  Often this is shortened to Rule or Policy (see I2NSF
      policy rule). (from [I-D.ietf-supa-generic-policy-info-model]).

   Profile:  A structured representation of information that uses a
      pre-defined set of capabilities of an object, typically in a
      specific context. Zero or more Capabilities may be changed at
      runtime. This may be used to simplify how this object interacts
      with other objects in its environment.

   Producer:  A Producer is a Role that is assigned to an I2NSF
      Component that can send information and/or commands to another
      I2NSF Component.  See also: Consumer, Role.

   Registry:  A logically centralized location containing data of a
      particular type; it may optionally contain metadata,
      relationships, and other aspects of the registered data in order
      to use those data effectively.  An I2NSF registry is used to
      contain capability information that can be controlled by the
      controller.

   Registration Interface:  An interface dedicated to requesting,
      receiving, editing, and deleting information in a Registry.

   Role:  An abstraction of a Component that models context-specific
      views and responsibilities of an object as separate Role objects.
      Role objects can optionally be attached to, and removed from, the
      object that the Role object describes at runtime. This provides
      three important benefits. First, it enables different behavior
      to be supported by the same Component for different contexts.
      Second, it enables the behavior of a Component to be adjusted
      dynamically (i.e., at runtime, in response to changes in context)
      by using one or more Roles to define the behavior desired for
      each context. Third, it decouples the Roles of a Component from
      the Applications use that Component.

   Service Interface:  An Interface dedicated to enabling Policy Rules
      to be managed. This is also called the I2NSF Consumer Interface.

   Service Provider Security Controller:  TBD (Editorial: Place holder
      for a split between controller and security controller
      definitions.)

   Tenant:  A group of users that share common access privileges to
      the same software.  An I2NSF tenant may be physical or virtual,
      and may run on a variety of systems or servers.

   Vendor-Facing Interface:  An Interface dedicated to registering and
      vendor-specific NSFs and Capabilities. It is also used to invoke
      vendor-specific functionality. This is also called the NSF-Facing
      Interface.
