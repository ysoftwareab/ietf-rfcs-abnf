1.  Introduction

   Network as a Service (NaaS) is a new network business model which
   describes services for network transport connectivity in the cloud
   computing area.  Considering network and computing resources as a
   whole, resource allocations are optimized.  The target of NaaS is to
   provide end to end virtual network with capacity for tenants in cloud
   datacenter, which is the essential part from the technical point of
   view.  In NaaS, operators' network infrastructure can be virtualized
   and multiplexed for selling, while clients can make the network
   provision and use their own virtual network according to specific
   requirements.

   In this draft, we focus on proposing network use cases of NaaS in
   datacenters.  Two typical use cases are provided.  One is about the
   virtual private cloud network and another is the intelligent traffic
   engineering across the datacenters.  In both use cases, basic network
   models are introduced and considerations about the use cases are
   pointed out.

   TS: tenant systems

   VM: virtual machine

   CE: customer edge

   PE: provider edge

3.  Use cases

3.1.  Use cases 1 VPN

   One of the typical use cases in NaaS is to construct the virtual
   private cloud network (VPCN) for tenants (i.e., enterprise,
   organization, etc) over the public cloud provided by the operators.
   Its main characteristic is that tenants can custom their own VPCN,
   i.e., network topology, VPN connection, network services, etc.
   Following Figure 1 is an logical network example for VPCN.

Internet-Draft               NaaS use cases                 October 2014


   NaaS provides the network more convinent to the tenants.  In
   traditional service, it takes a long time for tenants to rent their
   own network, while it costs more time for tenants to configure their
   network.  Because the all the configurations are delivered by
   adminstrators manually.Besides, extensibility is limited to the
   number of vlan supported.Tenants are not avaliable to monitor their
   network.So it turns to NaaS in VPCN.

   In NaaS, the tenants can define their networks by themselves simply
   by Graphical User Interface.  And the network they construct can be
   controlled by themselves as well.  The administrators can take a
   global control from the management plane.  NaaS provides it available
   that networks rather than unique devices are for sale.

   In such a framework, the interface information from the tenants' side
   can be an issue, as the standard interface has several features.
   Tenants apply for the virtual network construction they need to
   deploy the end to end network.  Different tenants are isolated from
   each other with their access policies defined by themselves.  The
   virtual network can be managed, monitored and configured by tenants.
   Because of the open access of network to the tenants, the network
   model aimed at the tenants should be thoughtful.  The network model
   is constituted of node, link, flow and policy.  Node acts as the role
   of forwarding or processing the dataflow by some policies.Service
   node provides the service, while computer node refers to the VMs.
   Link connects two nodes.  The network model can be divided into
   several typical models to provide one of network service, something
   like LBaaS, FWaaS or DNSaaS and so on.

3.2.  Use cases 2 Intelligent traffic engineering across datacenters

   The intelligent traffic engineering can be regarded as another
   typical use case of Network as a Service, such as the network
   management across the data center.  NaaS can provide the virtual
   network across datacenters with intelligent traffic engineering and
   load balancing.  With the virtualized network and centralized
   controlling, NaaS offers the capability of scheduling the traffic at
   different levels of traffic QoS, reliability and transparency in a
   flexible and scalable way.  Besides due to the virtual network,
   virtual machines can migrate from one datacenter to another flexibly.
   The network model is constituted of node, link, flow and policy as
   well.

   Superior to the traditional network with the condition of congestion,
   virtualized network provides the advantage of network bandwidth
   optimization.  By the statistical data of the current traffic,
   Network as a Service schedules the traffic based on centralized
   computing intelligently.

   In addition, services and tenants can be labeled in different
   priority due to their features.  Thus QoS can be guaranteed.

   TBD.

5.  Security considerations

   In NaaS, security can be a problem in several aspects.  To meet the
   requirement of the tenants, the virtual network should be secured and
   tenants' traffic should be isolated with each other.  On the other

   side, the security in NaaS is reflected in that traffic access should
   be authorized.  Other security in such as VM migration can also be an
   issue.

6.  Summary

   This draft describes some typical use cases of NaaS in datacenters.
   NaaS provides network as a service to tenants.  Tenants can build
   their own network by NaaS easily with the basic network model
   provided.  Through NaaS, traffic across the datacenters can be
   optimized by intelligent traffic engineering.  It's expressed in
   given use cases that network virtualized with basic models can be
   helpful in providing NaaS.
