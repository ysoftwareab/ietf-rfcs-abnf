        Support for adjustable maximum router lifetimes per-link
                        draft-ietf-6man-maxra-00

Abstract

   The neighbor discovery protocol specifies the maximum time allowed
   between sending unsolicited multicast Router Advertisements from a
   router interface as well as the maximum router lifetime.  It also
   allows the limits to be overridden by link-layer specific documents.
   This document allows for overriding these values on a per-link basis.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery relies on IP multicast with the expectation
   to be efficient with respect to available bandwidth and to avoid
   generating interrupts in the network nodes.  On some datalink-layer
   network, for example IEEE 802.11 WiFi, this is not the case because
   of limitations in the services offered by the datalink-layer network
   [draft-vyncke-6man-mcast-not-efficient-01].  On such links any
   possible reduction of multicast traffic will be highly beneficial.
   Unfortunately, due to the fixed protocol constants specified in
   [RFC4861] it is difficult to relax the multicast timers for neighbor
   discovery.  There are already link technology specific clarifications
   how to tune protocol constants for certain system with the
   expectation to reduce excess Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)
   traffic. 3GPP cellular links are one existing example
   [RFC6459][RFC7066].

   This document specifies updates to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   Protocol [RFC4861] for relaxing the the maximum time allowed between
   sending unsolicited multicast Router Advertisements (RA) from a
   router interface as well as for the maximum router lifetime.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Relationship between AdvDefaultLifetime and MaxRtrAdvInterval

   MaxRtrAdvInterval is an upper bound on the time between the two
   successive Router Advertisement messages are sent, therefore one
   might reason about the relationship between these two values in terms
   of the ratio K=AdvDefaultLifetime/MaxRtrAdvInterval, which expresses
   how many Router Advertisements will be guaranteed to be sent before
   the router lifetime expiry.

   Assuming unicast Solicited Router Advertisements or a perfectly
   stable network, on a theoretically perfect link with no losses, it
   would have been sufficient to have K just above 1 - so that the sent
   Router Advertisement refreshes the router entry just before it
   expires.  On the real links which allow for some loss, one would need
   to use K>2 in order to minimize the chances of a single router
   advertisement loss causing a loss of the router entry.

   The exact calculation will depend on the packet loss probability.  An
   example: if we take a ballpark value of 1% probability of a packet
   loss, then K=2 will give 0.01% percent chance of an outage due to a
   packet loss, K=3 will give 0.0001% chance of an outage, and so forth.
   To reverse the numbers, with these parameters, K~=1 gives 99%
   reliability, K~=2 gives 99.99% reliability, and K~=3 gives 99.9999%
   reliability - the latter should be good enough for a lot of
   scenarios.

   In a network with higher packet loss or if the higher reliability is
   desired, the K might be chosen to be even higher.  On the other hand,
   some of the data link layers provide reliable delivery at layer 2 -
   so there one might even consider using the "theoretical" value of K
   just above 1.  Since the choice of these two parameters does not
   impact the interoperability per se, this document does not impose any
   specific constraints on their values other than providing the
   guidelines in this section, therefore each individual link can
   optimize accordingly to its use case.

   Also AdvDefaultLifetime MUST be set to a value greater than or equal
   to the selected MaxRtrAdvInterval.  Otherwise, a router lifetime is
   guaranteed to expire before the new Router Advertisement has a chance
   to be sent, thereby creating an outage.

4.  Updates to RFC4861

   This document updates Section 6.2.1. of [RFC4861] to update the
   following router configuration variables.  MaxRtrAdvInterval MUST be
   no greater than 65535.  AdvDefaultLifetime MUST be between
   MaxRtrAdvInterval and 65535.

5.  Host Behavior

   Legacy hosts on a link with updated routers may have issues with a
   Router Lifetime of more than 9000 seconds.  In the few
   implementations we have tested with general purpose operating
   systems, there does not seem to be any issues with setting this field
   to more than 9000, but there might be implementations that
   incorrectly (since RFC4861 requires receivers to handle any value)
   reject such RAs.

6.  Security Considerations

   On a link where router advertisements are few and far between, the
   attack window for a rogue router to send an unsolicited RA is greatly
   increased.  These attacks can easily be prevented by using SeND
   [RFC3971]

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA action.
