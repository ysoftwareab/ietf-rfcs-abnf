<p>The Appointed Forwarder on a link for VLAN-x is the RBridge that ingresses native frames from the link and egresses native frames to the link in VLAN-x.  If the appointed forwarder for an end station is changed, the remote data traffic to the end station could fail.  This document is proposed to assign a nickname for pseudonode identifying a multi-access link to solve the issue.  When any appointed forwarder encapsulates a packet, it uses the pseudonode nickname as "ingress      nickname" rather than its own nickname.  If it does, then if the appointed forwarder changes, or the DRB changes, and the pseudonode still uses the same nickname, then the remote RBridge caches won't need to change, and the data traffic to the end station would reach the link uninterruptedly.  </p>

  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#intro.problem.statement" id="intro.problem.statement">Problem Statement</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The IETF TRILL protocol <a href="#RFC6325">[RFC6325]</a> provides optimal pair-wise data frame forwarding without configuration, safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic.  TRILL accomplishes this by using [IS-IS] <a href="#RFC1195">[RFC1195]</a> link state routing and encapsulating traffic using a header that includes a hop count. The design supports VLANs and optimization of the distribution of multi-destination frames based on VLANs and IP derived multicast groups.  Devices that implement TRILL are called RBridges.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">The AF (Appointed Forwarder) on a link for VLAN-x is the RBridge that  ingresses native frames from the link and egresses native frames to the link in VLAN-x. If the appointed forwarder for an end station goes down and a different RBridge is appointed as appointed forwarder on the link, the end station will not perceive the changes. Therefore, the cache in remote RBridge could not be correct until it receives the data traffic from the end station, and the traffic from the remote RBridge to the end station could fail for a while.  It is even worse for the Swap Nickname Field approach in multi-level TRILL network, for the egress RBridge of remote level 1 area cannot update the correspondence of MAC/VLAN-x and the pair of {ingress nickname, swap ingress nickname} until it receives the data traffic from end station <a href="#Mltrill">[Mltrill]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">Pseudonode nickname is proposed in this document to solve the above issue. Pseudonode nickname is assigned by DRB and used to identify a multi-access link.  With pseudonode nickname, the data traffic to the end station can reach the destination link uninterruptedly and be forwarded to the end station by other RBridge even if the appointed forwarder for the VLAN on the link is changed.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">This document is organized as following: <a href="#intro.pseudonode.nickname">Section 2</a> is the concept of pseudonode nickname.  <a href="#intro.lsp.announcement">Section 3</a> introduces the LSP announcement mechanism for the pseudonode nickname.  <a href="#intro.influence.on.tansit.frame.processing">Section 4</a> describes the RBridges processing of transit frame traffic when considering pseudonode nickname. <a href="#intro.tlv.extensions.for.pseudonode.nickname">Section 6</a> specifies pseudonode nickname capability TLV and pseudonode nickname TLV format.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">Familiarity with <a href="#RFC6325">[RFC6325]</a> is assumed in this document.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> Terminology and Acronyms</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">This document uses the acronyms defined in <a href="#RFC6325">[RFC6325]</a> and the following additional acronym: </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">AF - Appointed Forwarder </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4">When used in lower case, these words convey their typical use in common language, and are not to be interpreted as described in <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> <a href="#intro.pseudonode.nickname" id="intro.pseudonode.nickname">Pseudonode Nickname</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">Pseudonode nickname is used to identify a link and SHOULD be reused after DRB changed.  It is assigned by DRB on the link.  When the RBridge becomes DRB and it doesn't find the pseudonode nickname from TRILL Hello of other RBridges, DRB assigns and announces a pseudonode nickname in its TRILL Hello on the link.  If the new DRB obtains the pseudonode nickname from the TRILL Hellos of adjacent RBridges on the link, it reuses this nickname. The nickname for the pseudonode SHOULD keep unchanged even if the DRB or AF changed.  </p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>When doing TRILL-encapsulation to a native frame, the RBridge MUST NOT send this frame in native form or TRILL form out of any ports except the port from which this native frame is received, if it uses the link's psuedonode nickname as ingress nickname to encapsulate the native frame into TRILL form. Only the TRILL-encapsulated frame is sent back to the link from the only port; </li>
<li>When recieving a multi-destination TRILL data frame, if the ingress nickname of the frame is the pseudonode nickname of one of its links, the RBridge processes the frame as specified in Section 4.6.2.5 of <a href="#RFC6325">[RFC6325]</a>, but MUST NOT forward this frame in native form to the link represented by the ingress nickname (even if it is the appointed forwarder for that link for the frame's VLAN).  </li>

<p></p>

<ul><li>For the RBridges in the first category, add all the RBridges in the second category as bogus adjacencies into their forwarding tables.

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.7">With the help of the above three changes of frame processing, the multi-detination TRILL-encapsulated frames can be ingressed into the chosen tree from the psudonode and propagated along the tree safely. For example, in Figure 2, when RB2 encapsulates a native frame (received from H2) to multi-destination TRILL frame where the ingress nickname is PseNickE1, it does not sent the native frame to H1 and the TRILL frame to RB5 but does send this TRILL frame back to pseudonode E1. Then this TRILL frame will be ingressed into this tree by RB3 and RB4. RB1 will recieve this frame from the correct port, i.e., the port on the right side, and propagate it out of the left port. At last, when receiving this frame, RB2 forwards it to RB5 and may decapsulate it into native form and forward to H1, but does not forward the native frame onto link E1.  </p>

<ul>
<li>The priority of the nickname reused by a new DRB SHOULD be lower than the priority of this nickname  found on this link (i.g., from its neighbors' hellos), before the DRB ensuring no other DRBs using the same nickname in their pseudonode LSPs.  </li>
<li>After ensuring no other DRBs using this pseudonode nickname, the DRB increases the priority of this nickname to its original found value.  </li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">When an RBridge is eleceted as new DRB and advertises its first pseudonode LSP where a pseudonode nickname is contained, it should start a non-cyclic waiting timer to detect such collision. If the timer expires and no such collision is found, the DRB can ensure that no other DRBs using the same pseudonode nickname.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.4">Whenever receiving a pseudonode LSP originated by other DRB, a DRB looks up the LSP in its LSP database to see whether it also has an instance of this LSP. If it does not, or if the database copy is less recent, it installs the LSP into its database. For such a pseudonode LSP, its pseudonode nickname will be compared with the link's nickname used by the DRB. If the two nicknames are same, pseudonode nickname collision is detected. Then the prirority of this nickname, along with system ID of the RBridge (numerically higher = higher priority) as tiebreaker, in the received LSP is compared with the priority (of this nickname) used locally.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.5">For the conflicting pseudonode nickname, the DRB performs the following extra steps to clear up this confliction: </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>if the nickname priority in the received LSP is higher, the DRB SHOULD give up this pseudonode nickname and acquire a new one; </li>
<li>else, the DRB continues to use this nickname, but it SHOULD update its pseudonode LSP (with a larger sequence number) to the TRILL campus.  </li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.7">If a DRB oughts to give up its pseudonode nickname and acquire a new one, it SHOULD inform other RBridges in TRILL campus to clear up some the MAC entries whose egress "RBrige" nicknames equal to this pseudonode nickname, or to modify the remaining time of these entries.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.8">Since DRB knows all the VLANs for which end-station service is enabled on its link, the mechanism of Appointed Forwarder Status Lost Counter (AFSLC) (see Section 4.8.3 of <a href="#RFC6325">[RFC6325]</a>) can be employed for this purpose. The DRB SHOULD update its pseudonode LSP, where the AFSLC for all these VLANs is increased at least one, before it uses the new acquired pseudonode nickname on this link and its pseudonode LSPs.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.9">Furthermore, if a DRB finds one or more such VLANs lost on its link, it SHOULD update its pseudonode LSP, in which the AFSLC for these VLANs is increased at least one, to inform other RBridges to handle the associated MAC entries in their forwarding tables.  </p>
