Abstract 
    
   This draft specifies a set of Policy Rule Classes (PRC) for the 
   enforcement of an IP traffic engineering policy by COPS-PR ([2])-
   capable routers. Instances of such classes reside in a virtual 
   information store, which is called the IP Traffic Engineering Policy 
   Information Base (IP TE PIB). The corresponding IP TE policy 
   provisioning data are intended for use by the COPS-PR IP TE Client-
   Type([3]), and they will complement the PRC classes that have been 
   defined in the Framework PIB ([4]).

1. Introduction 
    
   The deployment of value-added IP services (like QoS (Quality of 
   Service)-based IP Virtual Private Networks) over the Internet has 
   become one of the most competing challenges for service providers, as 
   well as a complex technical issue, as far as the appropriate 
   provisioning and usage of the resources of the IP networks is 
   concerned. 
    
   From this standpoint, the COPS protocol and its usage for the support 
   of Policy Provisioning ([2]) is one of the ongoing specification 
   effort of the Resource Allocation Protocol (rap) Working Group of the 
   IETF that should help service providers in dynamically enforcing an 
   IP Traffic Engineering (IP TE) policy which happens to be one the key 
   components to service customers according to the contents of the 
   contractual agreements they have signed with their service 
   provider(s). 
    
   Indeed, the enforcement of an IP traffic engineering policy is based 
   upon the use of a high level of automation for the dynamic 
   provisioning of the configuration data that will be taken into 
   account by the routers to select the appropriate IP routes. 
    
   As such, an IP traffic engineering policy (partly) consists in 
   appropriately provisioning, and allocating/de-allocating, the 
   switching and the transmission resources of an IP network (i.e. the 
   routers and the links that connect these routers, respectively), 
   according to Quality of Service (QoS) requirements (e.g. rate, one-
   way delay, inter-packet delay variation, etc.) that have been 
   expressed by the customers who can access such resources within the 
   context of a given service subscription procedure ([5]). 
    
   Within the context of this document, the actual enforcement of an IP 
   traffic engineering policy is primarily based upon the activation of 
   both intra- and inter-domain dynamic routing protocols ([6], [7]) 
   that will be activated in the network to appropriately select, 
   install, maintain and possibly withdraw routes that will comply with 
   the above-mentioned QoS requirements and/or specific routing 
   constraints, depending on the type of traffic that will be conveyed 
   along these traffic engineered routes. 
    
   It is therefore necessary to provide the route selection processes 
   with the information that will exactly reflect these QoS 
   requirements, given the dynamic routing protocols support traffic 
   engineering capabilities for the calculation and the selection of 
   such routes.

Internet Draft       An IP Traffic Engineering PIB            Nov. 2001 
                                     
                                     
    
   These capabilities are currently being specified in [8] and [9] for 
   the OSPF (Open Shortest Path First, [5]) and the IS-IS (Intermediate 
   System to Intermediate System routing protocol, [10]) interior 
   routing protocols respectively, while there is an equivalent and 
   ongoing specification effort for the BGP4 (Border Gateway Protocol, 
   version 4) protocol, as described in [11], for example. 
    
   To provide the route selection processes with the above-mentioned 
   information, one possibility is to use the COPS protocol and its 
   usage for policy provisioning, together with a collection of 
   provisioning data that will be stored in a virtual information store, 
   called a Policy Information Base. 
    
   This draft describes a collection of Policy Rule Classes that are 
   based upon the use of above-mentioned extensions to existing IP 
   routing protocols - namely the OSPF and the BGP4 protocols, and which 
   will be stored and dynamically maintained in the IP TE PIB. The 
   "rule" and "role" concepts, which have been defined in [12], are 
   adopted by this document to distribute the IP traffic engineering 
   policy provisioning data over the COPS-PR protocol. 
    
   This document is organized as follows: 
    
   - Section 4 introduces some considerations about the scalability of 
     such a dynamic provisioning scheme, 
    
   - Section 5 provides an overview of the organization of the IP TE 
     PIB, 
    
   - Section 6 provides a description of the PRC classes of the IP TE 
     PIB, according to the semantics of the Structure of Policy 
     Provisioning Information (SPPI, [13]). 
    
2. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [14]. 
    
3. Changes since the last version 
    
   - Section 6 has been updated according to the semantics rules 
     introduced in [13], 
    
   - The PIB itself has been slightly reorganized to introduce an 
     additional level of hierarchy, so that the IP TE provisioning 
     information is now classified into three main classes - the "route 
     information" classes, the "traffic engineering metrics" classes, 
     and the "statistics" classes. Next versions of the draft will 
     complement each of these classes as appropriate,

4. Scalability considerations 
    
   The usage of the COPS-PR protocol for the dynamic enforcement of an 
   IP traffic engineering policy that would be based upon the use of 
   traffic engineering extensions to IP routing protocols naturally 
   raises the scalability issue, as far as the volume of configuration 
   information that will be exchanged not only between the routers 
   themselves (because of the OSPF machinery for example), but also 
   between the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) components embedded in the 
   routers and the PDP (Policy Decision Point) they communicate with  is 
   concerned. 
    
   While the concern strictly related to the design of a routing policy 
   is outside the scope of this document, the dynamic provisioning of 
   metric values as well as the dynamic reports related to the actual 
   enforcement of decisions taken by the PDP, deserve some elaboration. 
    
4.1. A tentative metric taxonomy 
    
   The metrics that will be taken into account by the SPF algorithms for 
   IP TE route calculation can be classified into two basic categories: 
    
     1. Permanently assigned metrics, which basically consist of the 
        "usual" cost metrics, as per [6]. These metrics are those that 
        are assigned on a per (logical) interface basis, and they aim at 
        reflecting the link quality the corresponding interface is 
        attached to. Such metrics can also be derived on a per-DSCP 
        basis, so that a given interface will be assigned different 
        costs, depending on the value of the DS field,  
    
     2. Dynamically assigned metrics, which MAY consist of the following 
        information: 
    
          - The available bandwidth, (e.g. based upon the SNMP (Simple 
            Network Management Protocol) variables like ifType, 
            ifInOctets and ifOutOctets),  
          - The amount of bandwidth that can be reserved, according to 
            arithmetic calculation based upon the above-mentioned 
            variables, for example, 
          - The amount of reserved bandwidth, according to the 
            information maintained in the PIB. 
           
   While statically assigned metric values should not change frequently 
   by definition (because they reflect the physical resources of the 
   network as they are available, as well as the generic routing policy 
   that has been defined by the network administrator to reflect how 
   such resources will be used), the dynamically assigned metric values 
   MAY vary like the ongoing usage of the resources of the network.

Internet Draft       An IP Traffic Engineering PIB            Nov. 2001 
                                     
                                     
    
   Therefore, the static or dynamic computation of dynamically assigned 
   metric values is in the magnitude of the corresponding SPF 
   computation, since newly assigned values yield the spontaneous 
   generation of LSU (Link State Update, [6]) messages. Hence, the IP 
   traffic engineering provisioning data exchange SHOULD be minimized 
   according to pre-computation engineering recommendations like those 
   described in [15]. 
    
4.2. Reporting the Enforcement of an IP Traffic Engineering Policy 
    
   Likewise, the actual enforcement of policy decisions implies the 
   activation of a reporting mechanism, as described in the COPS-PR 
   specification. From this perspective, this draft assumes that the 
   corresponding reports sent by the PEP components of the routers 
   towards the PDP SHOULD include the traffic engineered routes that 
   have been computed by the routers, at least for network planning 
   purposes: the service subscription requests will be negotiated 
   according to the knowledge of the network resources that are actually 
   available, and this information includes the routes that could very 
   well service the above-mentioned requirements, without any extra 
   computation (within the context of [5], for example).  
    
   From this perspective, the report of the installed routes is in the 
   magnitude of the route announcement procedures of the IP routing 
   protocols machineries (like OSPF), and it is therefore assumed that 
   the volume of the corresponding COPS-PR traffic is also highly 
   dependent on the pre-computation engineering recommendations that 
   have been mentioned in the above section 3.1.  
    
   In other words, this draft assumes that it is mainly the 
   responsibility of deploying an IP traffic engineering policy that 
   should raise scalability issues, NOT the choice of activating the 
   COPS-PR protocol as a means to convey the IP TE provisioning data 
   that will reflect such a deployment. 
    
   Nevertheless, it is obviously one of the most important concerns of 
   the ongoing specification and development effort that is partly 
   reflected by this draft, and which is further described in [5]. In 
   particular, it is the intention of the author of this draft to later 
   submit a publication that will aim at depicting the simulation 
   results obtained through the validation of this COPS-PR architecture 
   for the dynamic enforcement of an IP traffic engineering policy 
   within the context of an operational service provider's environment.  
    
5. PIB Overview 
    
   The dynamic enforcement of an IP traffic engineering policy is based 
   upon the activation of intra- and inter-domain routing protocols that 
   will have the ability to take into account traffic engineering-
   related information for the calculation and the selection of routes, 
   which will comply as much as possible with the QoS requirements that

Internet Draft       An IP Traffic Engineering PIB            Nov. 2001 
                                     
                                     
   have been contractually defined between customers and service 
   providers. 
    
   This traffic engineering-related information is basically composed of 
   metric values (as they have been depicted in [8] for the traffic 
   engineering extensions to the OSPF protocol, for example) that will 
   aim at reflecting an IP TE policy, as well as the result of the 
   enforcement of such a policy, so that customers and providers can 
   check anytime that the IP service is provisioned with the appropriate 
   (and contractual) levels of automation (which can be expressed in 
   terms of accessing the service, for example) and quality (which can 
   be expressed in terms of service availability, for example). 
    
   Therefore, the IP TE PIB mainly aims at: 
    
   - Storing and maintaining the configuration information that will be 
     used by the routers to calculate and select the routes that will 
     comply with a collection of QoS requirements, such as the one-way 
     maximum transit delay, or the maximum inter-packet delay 
     variation, 
 
   - Storing and maintaining the information related to the traffic 
     engineered routes that have been installed in the routers' 
     Forwarding Information Bases, so that the service providers have 
     the permanent knowledge of the network's resources availability. 
    
   From this perspective, the IP TE PIB is currently organized into the 
   following provisioning classes: 
    
     1. The OSPF TE Metrics Table: this class represents the collection 
        of provisioning data that will reflect a specific intra-domain 
        routing policy, in terms of TE metric value assignment, 
      
     2. The BGP TE Table: this class aims at depicting the BGP routes 
        that have been announced by the routers with associated QoS 
        information, 
      
     3. The IP TE Route Table: this class describes the information 
        related to the traffic engineered routes that have been 
        installed by the routers in their FIB bases, according to the 
        traffic engineering policy they will have to enforce.

7. Security Considerations 
    
   The traffic engineering policy provisioning data as they are 
   described in this PIB will be used for configuring the appropriate 
   network elements that will be involved in the dynamic enforcement of 
   these traffic engineering policies, by means of a COPS-PR 
   communication that will convey this information. 
    
   The function of dynamically provisioning network elements with such 
   configuration information implies that only an authorized COPS-PR 
   communication take place.

   From this perspective, this draft does not introduce any additional 
   security issues other than those that have been identified in the 
   COPS-PR specification, and it is therefore recommended that the IPSec 
   ([19]) protocol suite be used to secure the above-mentioned 
   authorized communication.
