          draft-ietf-kitten-tls-channel-bindings-for-tls13-12

Abstract

   This document defines a channel binding type, tls-exporter, that is
   compatible with TLS 1.3 in accordance with RFC 5056, On Channel
   Binding.  Furthermore it updates the "default" channel binding to the
   new binding for versions of TLS greater than 1.2.  This document
   updates RFC5801, RFC5802, RFC5929, RFC7677, and RFC8446.

1.  Introduction

   The "tls-unique" channel binding type defined in [RFC5929] was found
   to be vulnerable to the "triple handshake vulnerability"
   [TRIPLE-HANDSHAKE] without the extended master secret extension
   defined in [RFC7627].  While TLS 1.3 uses a complete transcript hash
   akin to the extended master secret procedures, the safety of channel
   bindings with TLS 1.3 was not analyzed as part of the core protocol
   work, and so the specification of channel bindings for TLS 1.3 was
   deferred.  [RFC8446] section C.5 notes the lack of channel bindings
   for TLS 1.3; as this document defines such channel bindings, it
   updates [RFC8446] to note that this gap has been filled.
   Furthermore, this document updates [RFC5929] by adding an additional
   unique channel binding type, "tls-exporter", that replaces some usage
   of "tls-unique".

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   Throughout this document the acronym "EKM" is used to refer to
   Exported Keying Material as defined in [RFC5705].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The 'tls-exporter' Channel Binding Type

   Channel binding mechanisms are not useful until TLS implementations
   expose the required data.  To facilitate this, "tls-exporter" uses
   exported keying material (EKM) which is already widely exposed by TLS
   implementations.  The EKM is obtained using the keying material
   exporters for TLS as defined in [RFC5705] and [RFC8446] section 7.5
   by supplying the following inputs:

   Label:  The ASCII string "EXPORTER-Channel-Binding" with no
      terminating NUL.

   Context value:  Zero-length string.

   Length:  32 bytes.

   This channel binding mechanism is defined only when TLS cipher
   negotiation results in unique master secrets, which is true of TLS
   1.3 which always behaves as if it were using the extended master
   secret fix required by previous versions of TLS (see [RFC8446]
   appendix D).

3.  TLS 1.3 with SCRAM or GSS-API over SASL

   SCRAM ([RFC5802], and [RFC7677]) and GSS-API over SASL [RFC5801]
   define "tls-unique" as the default channel binding to use over TLS.
   As "tls-unique" is not defined for TLS 1.3 (and greater), this
   document updates [RFC5801], [RFC5802], and [RFC7677] to use "tls-
   exporter" as the default channel binding over TLS 1.3 (and greater).
   Note that this document does not change the default channel binding
   for SCRAM mechanisms over TLS 1.2 [RFC5246], which is still "tls-
   unique".

4.  Security Considerations

   The channel binding type defined in this document is constructed so
   that disclosure of the channel binding data does not leak secret
   information about the TLS channel and does not affect the security of
   the TLS channel.

   The Security Considerations sections of [RFC5056], [RFC5705], and
   [RFC8446] apply to this document.

4.1.  Use with Legacy TLS

   While it is possible to use this channel binding mechanism with TLS
   versions below 1.3, extra precaution must be taken to ensure that the
   chosen cipher suites always result in unique master secrets.  For
   more information see [RFC7627] and the Security Considerations
   section of [RFC5705].

   When TLS renegotiation is enabled on a connection the "tls-exporter"
   channel binding type is not defined for that connection and
   implementations MUST NOT support it.

   In general, users wishing to take advantage of channel binding should
   upgrade to TLS 1.3 or later.

   The derived data MUST NOT be used for any purpose other than channel
   bindings as described in [RFC5056].  In particular, implementations
   MUST NOT use channel binding as a secret key to protect privileged
   information.

5.  IANA Considerations
