Abstract

   The Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) defines a basic XML
   format for presenting presence information for a presentity.  The
   Contact Information for Presence Information Data Format (CIPID) is
   an extension that adds elements to PIDF that provide additional
   contact information about a presentity and its contacts, including
   references to address book entries and icons.

Internet-Draft                   CIPID                         July 2004


1.  Introduction

   In its function of facilitating communication, the usefulness of
   presence information can be enhanced by providing basic information
   about a presentity or contact.  This specification describes a basic
   set of information elements that allow a watcher to retrieve
   additional information about a presentity or contact.

   This specification defines extensions to the PIDF [5] XML (Extensible
   Markup Language) [6] document format.

   We describe elements for providing a "business card", references to
   the homepage, map, representative sound and an icon.  All elements
   can be used either for the whole presence document, extending the
   <presence> element, or for an individual tuple, when they are added
   to a <tuple> element.

   This additional presence information can be used in PIDF [5]
   documents, together with RPID [7], future-status [8] and other PIDF
   extensions.

   The namespace URI for these elements defined by this specification is
   a URN [2], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [3] and
   extended by [4]:


      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:cipid

   All elements described in this document are optional and can be used
   within the PIDF <presence> element.

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT,
   RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted
   as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].

3.  CIPID Elements

   The elements below refer to content using URIs.  If the watcher
   retrieves the content pointed to by the URI, it may provide hints
   that it is currently using the presence application.  Thus, for
   increased watcher privacy, a presence application MAY want to cache
   these objects for later use.

3.1  Card Element

   The <card> element includes a URI pointing to a business card, e.g.,

   in LDIF [10] or vCard [9] format.

3.2  Display-Name Element

   The <display-name> element includes the name identifying the tuple or
   presentity that the presentity suggests should be shown by the
   watcher user interface.  It is up to watcher user interface to choose
   whether to heed this suggestion or use some other suitable string.

3.3  Homepage Element

   The <homepage> element provides a URI pointing to general information
   about the tuple or presentity, typically a web home page.

3.4  Icon Element

   The <icon> element provides a URI pointing to an image (icon)
   representing the tuple or presentity.  The watcher MAY use this
   information to represent the tuple or presentity in a graphical user
   interface.  Presentities SHOULD provide images of sizes and aspect
   ratios that are appropriate for rendering as an icon. Support for
   JPEG, PNG and GIF formats is RECOMMENDED.

3.5  Map Element

   The <map> element provides a URI pointing to a map related to the
   tuple or presentity.  The watcher MAY use this information to
   represent the tuple or presentity in a graphical user interface.  The
   map may be either an image, an HTML client-side image map or a
   geographical information system (GIS) document, e.g., encoded as GML.
   Support for images formatted as PNG and GIF is RECOMMENDED.

3.6  Sound Element

   The <sound> element provides a URI pointing to a sound related to the
   tuple or presentity.  The watcher MAY use the sound object, such as a
   MIDI or MP3 file, referenced by the URL to inform the watcher that
   the presentity has assumed the status OPEN.  Implementors are advised
   to create user interfaces that provide the watcher with the
   opportunity to choose whether to play such sounds. Support for sounds
   coded as MPEG-2 Layer 3 (MP3) is RECOMMENDED.

4.  Example

   An example, combining RPID and CIPID, is shown below:

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document calls for IANA to register a new XML namespace URN and
   schema per [4].

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:cipid
   Description: This is the XML namespace for XML elements defined by
      RFCXXXX to describe contact information presence information
      extensions for the status element in the PIDF presence document
      format in the application/pidf+xml content type.

   Registrant Contact: IESG
   XML: See Figure 1

7.  Security Considerations

   The security issues are similar to those for RPID [7].  Watchers need
   to restrict which content types of content pointed to by <icon>,
   <sound>, <map> and <vcard> elements they render.

   Also, accessing these URIs may in turn provide hints that the watcher
   is currently using the presence application. Thus, a presence
   application may want to cache these objects for later use.

   Icons and other URIs in this document could be used as a covert
   channel to convey messages to the watcher, outside the content
   monitoring that might be in place for instant messages or other
   communications channels.  Thus, entities that worry about such
   channels may want to prohibit the usage of URLs pointing to resources
   outside their domain, for example.
