      Generic YANG Data Model for Operations, Administration, and
         Maintenance(OAM) protocols for Connectionless networks
               draft-ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam-13

Abstract

   This document presents a base YANG Data model for connectionless
   Operations Administration, and Maintenance(OAM) protocols.  It
   provides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs
   for connectionless protocols.  The base model presented here can be
   extended to include technology specific details.  This is leading to
   uniformity between OAM protocols and support both nested OAM
   workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different or same levels
   through a unified interface) and interacting OAM workflows ( i.e.,
   performing OAM functions at same levels through a unified interface).

Internet-Draft       Connection-Less OAM YANG model         October 2017


1.  Introduction

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) are important
   networking functions that allow operators to:

   1.  Monitor networks connections (Reachability Verification,
       Continuity Check).

   2.  Troubleshoot failures (Fault verification and localization).

   3.  Monitor Performance

   An overview of OAM tools is presented at [RFC7276].

   Ping and Traceroute [RFC792], [RFC4443] are well-known fault
   verification and isolation tools, respectively, for IP networks.
   Over the years, different technologies have developed similar tools
   for similar purposes.

   The different OAM tools may support connection-oriented technologies
   or connectionless technologies.  In connection-oriented technologies,
   a connection is established prior to the transmission of data.  After
   connection is established, no additional control information such as
   signaling or operations and maintenance information is required to
   transmit the data.  In connectionless technologies, data is typically
   sent between end points without prior arrangement, but control
   information is required to identify destination.[G.800][RFC7276].
   Note that the Connection-Oriented OAM YANG DATA model is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lime-yang-connection-oriented-oam-model].

   In this document, we presents a base YANG Data model for
   connectionless OAM protocols.  The generic YANG model for
   connectionless OAM only includes configuration data and state data.
   It can be used in conjunction with data retrieval method model
   [I-D.ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam-methods], which focuses on
   data retrieval procedures like RPC.  However it also can be used
   independently of data retrieval method model.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  client

   o  configuration data

   o  server

Internet-Draft       Connection-Less OAM YANG model         October 2017


   o  state data

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC6020].

2.1.  Terminology

   TP - Test Point

   MAC - Media Access Control

   BFD - Bidirectional Forwarding Detection

   RPC - A Remote Procedure Call

   RPC operation - A specific Remote Procedure Call.

   CC - Continuity Check [RFC7276] , Continuity Checks are used to
   verify that a destination is reachable and therefore also referred to
   as reachability verification

3.  Overview of the Connectionless OAM Model

   The model is augmented to "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node"
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo] using 'test-point-locations'
   defined in Section 3.5.  The tool attribute 'tp-tools' grouping
   defined in this model is corresponding to technology-independent
   retrieval procedures (RPC operations) defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam-methods] and supports one of
   two basic types of activation: proactive and on-demand (determined by
   'session-type' grouping defined in this model, see section 3.2).

   At the top of the model, there is an 'cc-oper-data' container for
   session statistics.  Grouping is also defined for common session
   statistics and these are only applicable for proactive OAM sessions.

   Multiple 'test-point-locations' keyed using technology specific keys
   (eg., IPv4 address for IPv4 locations) are augmented into network
   nodes which are defined in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo] to

   describe the network hierarchies and the inventory of nodes contained
   in a network.  Each test point location under 'test-point-locations
   'grouping is chosen based on 'tp-location-type' leaf which when
   chosen, leads to a container that includes a list of 'test-point-
   locations' keyed by technology specific keys (e.g., 'ipv4-location'
   leaf ).  Each test point location under 'test-point-locations
   'grouping includes a 'test-point-location-info' grouping.  The 'test-
   point-location-info' grouping includes 'tp-technology' grouping, 'tp-
   tools' grouping, and 'connectionless-oam-tps' grouping.  The
   groupings of 'tp-address' and 'tp-address-ni' are kept out of 'test-
   point-location-info' grouping to make it addressing agnostic and
   allow varied composition.  Depending upon the choice of the 'tp-
   location-type' (determined by the 'tp-address-ni'), the containers
   differ in its composition of 'test- point-locations' while the 'test-
   point-location-info', is a common aspect of every 'test-point-
   locations'.  The 'tp-address-ni' grouping is used to describe the
   corresponding network instance.  The 'tp-technology'grouping indicate
   OAM technology details.  The 'tp-tools' grouping describe the OAM
   tools supported.  The 'connectionless-oam-tps' grouping is used to
   describe the relationship of one test point with other test points.
   The 'position' in 'oam-neighboring-tps' indicate relative position of
   neighboring test point corresponding to the current test point.

3.1.  TP Address

   In connectionless OAM, the TP address is defined with the following
   type:

   o  MAC address [RFC6136]

   o  IPv4 or IPv6 address

   o  TP-attribute

   o  System-id to represent the device or
      node.[I-D.ietf-spring-sr-yang]

   To define a forwarding treatment of a test packet, the 'tp-
   address'grouping needs to be associated with additional parameters,
   e.g.  DSCP for IP or EXP (renamed to Traffic Classic in RFC5462) for
   MPLS.  In generic connectionless OAM YANG model, these parameters are
   not explicit configured.  The model user can add corresponding
   parameters according to their requirements.

Internet-Draft       Connection-Less OAM YANG model         October 2017


3.2.  Tools

   The different OAM tools may be used in one of two basic types of
   activation: proactive and on-demand.  The proactive OAM refers to OAM
   actions which are carried out continuously to permit proactive
   reporting of fault.  The proactive OAM method requires persistent
   configuration.  The on-demand OAM refers to OAM actions which are
   initiated via manual intervention for a limited time to carry out
   diagnostics.  The on-demand OAM method requires only transient
   configuration.[RFC7276] [G.8013].  In connectionless OAM, 'session-
   type' grouping is defined to indicate which kind of activation will
   be used by the current session.

   In connectionless OAM, the tools attribute is used to describe a
   toolset for fault detection and isolation.  And it can serve as a
   constraint condition when the base model be extended to specific OAM
   technology.  For example, to fulfill the ICMP PING configuration, the
   "../coam:continuity-check" leaf should be set to "true", and then the
   lime base model should be augmented with ICMP PING specific details.

3.3.  OAM neighboring test points

   As typical networks have a multi-layer architecture, the set of OAM
   protocols similarly take a multi-layer structure; each layer may have
   its own OAM protocol [RFC7276] corresponding to a specific
   administrative domain and has associated test points.  OAM
   neighboring test points are referred to a list of neighboring test
   points in the same layer that are related to the current test point.
   This allows users to easily navigate between related neighboring
   layers to efficiently troubleshoot a defect.  In this model, the
   'position' leaf defines the relative position of the neighboring test
   point corresponding to the current test point in the same layer, and
   is provided to allow correlation of faults at different locations.
   If there is one neighboring test point placed before the current test
   point, the 'position' leaf is set to -1.  If there is one neighboring
   test point placed after the current test point, the 'position' leaf
   is set to 1.  If there is no neighboring test point placed before or
   after the current test point, the 'position' leaf is set to 0.

              }

3.4.  Test Point Locations Information

   This is a generic grouping for Test Point Locations Information
   (i.e., test-point-location-info grouping).  It Provide details of
   Test Point Location using 'tp-technology','tp-tools' grouping, 'oam-
   neighboring-tps' grouping defined above.

3.5.  Test Point Locations

   This is a generic grouping for Test Point Locations.  'tp-location-
   type 'leaf is used to define locations types, for example 'ipv4-
   location-type', 'ipv6-location-type', etc.  Container is defined
   under each location type containing list keyed to test point address,
   Test Point Location Information defined in section above, and network
   instance name(e.g.,VRF instance name) if required.

3.6.  Path Discovery Data

   This is a generic grouping for path discovery data model that can be
   retrieved by any data retrieval methods including RPC operations.
   Path discovery data output from methods, includes 'src-test-point'
   container, 'dst-test-point' container, 'sequence-number'leaf, 'hop-

   cnt'leaf, session statistics of various kinds, path verification and
   path trace related information.  Path discovery includes data to be
   retrieved on a 'per- hop' basis via a list of 'path-trace-info-
   list'list which includes information like 'timestamp'grouping, '
   ingress-intf-name ', ' egress-intf-name ' and 'app-meta-data'.  The
   path discovery data model is made generic enough to allow different
   methods of data retrieval.  None of the fields are made mandatory for
   that reason.  Noted that the retrieval methods are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam-methods].

3.7.  Continuity Check Data

   This is a generic grouping for continuity check data model that can
   be retrieved by any data retrieval methods including RPC operations.
   Continuity check data output from methods, includes 'src-test-
   point'container, 'dst-test-point'container, 'sequence-number' leaf,
   'hop-cnt'leaf and session statistics of various kinds.  The
   continuity check data model is made generic enough to allow different
   methods of data retrieval.  None of the fields are made mandatory for
   that reason.  Noted that the retrieval methods are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam-methods].

5.  Connectionless model applicability

   "ietf-connectionless-oam" model defined in this document provides
   technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for
   connectionless protocols.  This model can be further extended to
   include technology specific details, e.g., adding new data nodes with
   technology specific functions and parameters into proper anchor
   points of the base model, so as to develop a technology-specific
   connectionless OAM model.

   This section demonstrates the usability of the connectionless YANG
   OAM data model to various connectionless OAM technologies, e.g., BFD,
   LSP ping.  Note that, in this section, we only present several
   snippets of technology-specific model extensions for illustrative
   purposes.  The complete model extensions should be worked on in
   respective protocol working groups.

5.1.  BFD Extension

5.1.1.  Augment Method

   The following sections shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model
   can be extended to cover BFD technology.  For this purpose, a set of
   extension are introduced such as technology-type extension and test-
   point attributes extension.

   Note that in BFD WG, there is a BFD YANG data model
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang] to be produced.  Users can choose to use "ietf-
   connectioless-oam" as basis and augment the "ietf-connectionless-oam"
   model with bfd specific details.  The bfd specific details can be the
   grouping defined in the BFD model.

5.1.1.1.  Technology type extension

   No BFD technology type has been defined in the "ietf-connectionless-
   oam" model.  Therefore a technology type extension is required in the
   model Extension.

   The snippet below depicts an example of augmenting "bfd" type into
   the ietf-connectionless-oam":

5.1.1.2.  Test point attributes extension

   To support bfd technology, the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can be
   extended and add bfd specific parameters under "test-point-locations"
   list and/or add new location type such as "bfd over MPLS-TE" under
   "location-type".

5.1.1.2.1.  Define and insert new nodes into corresponding test-point-
            location

   In the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model, multiple "test-point-
   location" lists are defined under the "location-type" choice node.
   Therefore, to derive a model for some bfd technologies ( such as ip
   single-hop, ip multi-hops, etc), data nodes for bfd specific details
   need to be added into corresponding "test-point-locations" list.  In
   this section, we reuse some groupings which are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang] as following:

   The snippet below shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can
   be extended to support "BFD IP single-hop":

   +"/coam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/"
           +"coam:test-point-locations"
   {
           container session-cfg {
             description "BFD IP single-hop session configuration";
             list sessions {
               key "interface dest-addr";
               description "List of IP single-hop sessions";
               leaf interface {
                 type if:interface-ref;
                 description
                   "Interface on which the BFD session is running.";
               }
               leaf dest-addr {
                 type inet:ip-address;
                 description "IP address of the peer";
               }
               uses bfd:bfd-grouping-common-cfg-parms;
               uses bfd:bfd-grouping-echo-cfg-parms;
             }
           }
   }

   Similar augmentations can be defined to support other BFD
   technologies such as BFD IP multi-hop, BFD over MPLS, etc.

5.1.1.2.2.  Add new location-type cases

   In the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model, If there is no appropriate
   "location type" case that can be extended, a new "location-type" case
   can be defined and inserted into the "location-type" choice node.

   Therefore, the model user can flexibly add "location-type" to support
   other type of test point which are not defined in the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" model.  In this section, we add a new "location-
   type" case and reuse some groupings which are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang] as follows:

   The snippet below shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can
   be extended to support "BFD over MPLS-TE":

    case te-location{
     list test-point-location-list{
      key "tunnel-name";
      leaf tunnel-name{
       type leafref{
    path "/te:te/te:tunnels/te:tunnel/te:name";
   }
   description
   "point to a te instance.";
      }
       uses bfd:bfd-grouping-common-cfg-parms;
           uses bfd-mpls:bfd-encap-cfg;
     }
    }
   }

   Similar augmentations can be defined to support other BFD
   technologies such as BFD over LAG, etc.

5.1.2.  Schema Mount

   And another alternative method is using schema mount mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount] in the "ietf-connectionless-oam".
   Within the "test-point-locations" list, a "root" attribute is defined
   to provide a mounted point for models mounted per "test-point-
   locations".  Therefore, the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can
   provide a place in the node hierarchy where other OAM YANG data
   models can be attached, without any special extension in the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" YANG data models [I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount].
   Note that the limitation of the Schema Mount method is it is not
   allowed to specify certain modules that are required to be mounted
   under a mount point.

   The snippet below depicts the definition of "root" attribute.

         anydata root {
          yangmnt:mount-point root;
          description
         "Root for models supported per
           test point";
         }

   The following section shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model
   can use schema mount to support BFD technology.

5.1.2.1.  BFD Modules be populated in schema-mount

   To support BFD technology, "ietf-bfd-ip-sh" and "ietf-bfd-ip-mh" YANG
   modules might be populated in the "schema-mounts" container:

5.2.  LSP ping extension

5.2.1.  Augment Method

   The following sections shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model
   can be extended to support LSP ping technology.  For this purpose, a
   set of extension are introduced such as technology-type extension and
   test-point attributes extension.

   Note that in MPLS WG, there is a LSP Ping YANG data model
   [I-D.zheng-mpls-lsp-ping-yang-cfg] to be produced.  Users can choose
   to use "ietf-connectioless-oam" as basis and augment the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" model with LSP Ping specific details in the model
   extension.  The LSP Ping specific details can be the grouping defined
   in the LSP ping model.

5.2.1.1.  Technology type extension

   No lsp-ping technology type has been defined in the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" model.  Therefore a technology type extension is
   required in the model extension.

   The snippet below depicts an example of augmenting the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" with "lsp-ping" type:

   {
      leaf lsp-ping{
      type string;
     }
   }

5.2.1.2.  Test point attributes extension

   To support lsp-ping, the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can be
   extended and add lsp-ping specific parameters can be defined and
   under "test-point-locations" list.

   User can reuse the attributes or groupings which are defined in
   [I-D.zheng-mpls-lsp-ping-yang-cfg] as follows:

   The snippet below depicts an example of augmenting the "test-point-
   locations" list with lsp ping attributes:

   augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/"
   +"coam:location-type/coam:ipv4-location-type"
   +"/coam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/"
           +"coam:test-point-locations"
   {
   list lsp-ping {
            key "lsp-ping-name";
            leaf lsp-ping-name {
             type string {
               length "1..31";
            }
           mandatory "true";
           description "LSP Ping test name.";
           ......
         }

5.2.2.  Schema Mount

   And another alternative method is using schema mount mechanism
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount] in the "ietf-connectionless-oam".
   Within the "test-point-locations" list, a "root" attribute is defined
   to provide a mounted point for models mounted per "test-point-
   locations".  Therefore, the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can
   provide a place in the node hierarchy where other OAM YANG data
   models can be attached, without any special extension in the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" YANG data models [I-D.ietf-netmod-schema-mount].

   The following section shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model
   can use schema mount to support LSP-PING technology.

5.2.2.1.  LSP-PING Modules be populated in schema-mount

   [I-D.zheng-mpls-lsp-ping-yang-cfg] might be populated in the "schema-

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   The vulnerable "config true" subtrees and data nodes are the
   following:

      /nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/cl-oam:location-type/cl-oam:ipv4-
      location-type/cl-oam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/cl-oam:test-
      point-locations/

      /nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/cl-oam:location-type/cl-oam:ipv6-
      location-type/cl-oam:test-point-ipv6-location-list/cl-oam:test-
      point-locations/

Internet-Draft       Connection-Less OAM YANG model         October 2017


      /nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/cl-oam:location-type/cl-oam:mac-
      location-type/cl-oam:test-point-mac-address-location-list/cl-
      oam:test-point-locations/

      /nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/cl-oam:location-type/cl-oam:group-
      as-number-location-type/cl-oam:test-point-as-number-location-list/
      cl-oam:test-point-locations/

      /nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/cl-oam:location-type/cl-oam:group-
      system-id-location-type/cl-oam:test-point-system-info-location-
      list/cl-oam:test-point-locations/

   Unauthorized access to any of these lists can adversely affect OAM
   management system handling of end-to-end OAM and coordination of OAM
   within underlying network layers.  This may lead to inconsistent
   configuration, reporting, and presentation for the OAM mechanisms
   used to manage the network.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /coam:cc-session-statistics-data/cl-oam:cc-ipv4-sessions-
      statistics/cl-oam:cc-session-statistics/cl-oam:session-count/
