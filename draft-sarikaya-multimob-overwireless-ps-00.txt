Abstract

   Multicast mobility using existing IETF protocols is inefficient.
   This document looks at the principal shorcomings in IGMP/MLD that
   arise from operating over three wireless links, IEEE 16e used in
   Mobile WiMAX, IEEE 802.11 used in Wi-Fi networks and 3GPP.

1.  Introduction

   More and more operators are beginning to provide the wireless
   broadband network services such as Mobile IPTV.  Mobile IPTV service
   is a kind of audio/video (A/V) service which is combined with
   interactive data for the related or supplementary information of A/V
   program using bi-directional wireless broadband links.  Users can
   enjoy the downlink A/V stream and request more detailed or value-
   added information via uplink simultaneously.  Mobile IPTV service,
   which can also be described as place-shifting IPTV service, is to
   ensure continuous and original IPTV experiences for the users who
   move to the other place from where he or she was originally
   subscribed for [ITUIPTV].

   Apart from Mobile IPTV which is considered "the killer application",
   content broadcasting and streaming over audio and video conferencing,
   online multiplayer gaming are applications of IP multicast technology
   for mobile users.

   In this document we will describe the problem of optimizing IGMP/MLD
   operation over wireless technologies.  Among the vast array of
   underlying wireless technologies, we have selected three: IEEE
   802.16e [802.16e] which is used in Mobile WiMAX, IEEE 802.11 which is
   used in Wireless LAN or Wi-Fi deployments world-wide and 3GPP's
   Evolved Packet System (EPS).  This documents elaborates on some of
   the problems discussed in [I-D.irtf-mobopts-mmcastv6-ps] and in
   [I-D.asaeda-multimob-igmp-mld-mobility-extensions].  It also states
   some newly emerging problems.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC3775], [RFC3376],
   [RFC3810].


3.  IGMP/MLD Operation over 802.16e

   WiMAX Forum Release 1.5 has defined Multicast Broadcast Services
   architecture.  This architecture was based on Phase 1 requirements
   defined by the service providers working group.

   Figure 1 illustrates the key components of WiMAX Multicast Broadcast
   Services (MCBCS) architecture.

                 Figure 1: IGMP/MLD on IEEE 802.16e Links

   Mobile nodes (MN) attach to a base station (BS) through wireless
   interfaces.  The Access Router (AR) located in the access service
   network (ASN) is the first IP hop router of MNs.  MN as the multicast
   receiver uses the access network to receive the content coming from
   the content network where the multicast source is located.  The MCBCS
   server in the connectivity service network (CSN) handles different
   multicast content programs, multicast sessions, data encryption
   support as well as IP multicast group management.  Multicast enabled
   core is assumed.  MCBCS uses link layer multicasting defined by IEEE
   however it also allows unicast tunneling where multicast is not
   supported.

   MCBCS considers broadcast services as pre-provisioned and requires
   the service joining procedure always initiated by the network.  In
   network initiated join, MN immediately starts receiving the multicast
   data after entering into the network.  MN initiated join using IGMP
   join message is also defined as an optional procedure.

   In the current MCBCS specification, IGMP is required in two places:
   MCBCS server and the AR which is the primary node that manages link
   layer multicast/broadcast (MBS) zones called primary MBS distribution
   Data Path Function.  MCBCS server does group management of all
   multicast groups served by various content sources in the core
   network.  MBS Distribution DPF does group management to make sure
   that it is connected to the multicast tree that originates in the CSN
   as a leaf.  MBS Distribution DPF also behaves like a multicast source
   for the MBS zone it serves to which other nodes join.

   IGMP needs to be supported at the MN also.  MN then can join/ leave
   multicast groups at will not requiring MN to join at the network
   entry.  However MN is required to have subscribed to the service
   already.

3.1.  Problem Statement

   First downlink/uplink multicast related problems will be stated
   followed by Phase 2 requirements related problems.

   IEEE 802.16e [802.16e] supports downlink multicast from the base
   stations to MNs.  Multicast traffic is carried at the link layer in
   connections identified by multicast version of Connection Identifier
   [RFC5121] called multicast CID which is 12 bits long.

   Uplink multicast from MN to BS is not defined in [802.16e].

   The following are the problems based on downlink/uplink multicast:

   o  Transmission of IP packets via service specific convergence
      sublayer is defined in [I-D.ietf-16ng-ipv4-over-802-dot-16-ipcs]
      for IPv4 and [RFC5121] for IPv6.  Mapping of the multicast group
      address which is in the destination address field of IPv6/v4
      datagram to a field in MAC header such as multicast CID is
      currently not defined in both documents.  Because of this it is
      not guaranteed that multicast datagrams belonging to the same
      multicast group would be carried using the same multicast CID
      downlink.
   o  Duplicating multicast datagram for each member MN in the group and
      then sending them unicast is proposed as a possible approach in
      [I-D.ietf-16ng-ipv4-over-802-dot-16-ipcs].  It is suggested that
      the multicast destination address is converted into MN IPv4
      unicast address during the downlink packet duplication.  Such an
      approach might break applications that are based on receiving
      multicast datagrams.
   o  Regarding uplink multicast support, since the link between MN and
      AR is point-to-point, it makes it necessary for the AR to become
      the multicast source.  In case of a mobile MN that would mean all
      ARs should have this capability.  This makes it difficult to have
      multicast source mobility support in 802.16e links.

   Phase 2 requirements relevant to IGMP/MLD include:

   o  MN initiated activation of additional MCBCS sessions while
      delivering the MCBCS program.
   o  Dynamic multicast group support enabling applications like multi-
      player games.

Internet-Draft              Mobile Multicast                  March 2009


   o  MCBCS Layer-2 security.

   Based on Phase 2 requirements we can state the following problems for
   group management protocols on IEEE 802.16e links:

   o  IGMP/MLD routers generate unsolicited group membership reports.
      When such a message is generated destined to a mobile node and if
      the mobile node is in dormant mode then MN has to be waken up
      using the idle mode and paging system before delivering the
      message.  It is undesirable to wake up a dormant mobile node
      unless there is an arrival of a new call.
   o  Dynamic multicast group support means MN can join a multicast
      group even if it was not previously subscribed to such a service.
      MN in this case has to be authenticated and authorized.  Usually
      network entry triggers such actions.  In this case authentication
      and authorization needs to be triggered by IGMP/MLD join message.
   o  Unlike DHCP which also defines messages exchanged on the local
      link, IGMP/MLD lacks security.


4.  IGMP/MLD Operation over 3GPP evolved packet system (EPS)

   3GPP Release 8 (LTE/SAE) has defined Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast
   Service (MBMS) architecture in 3GPP TS 23.246 [23246] and
   corresponding enhancements for GPRS towards the evolved Radio Access
   Network (RAN) in 3GPP TS 23.401 [23401].  Whereas within 3GPP an
   optional use of the GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) for mobility
   support is described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [23401], in 3GPP TS 23.402
   [23402] the architecture enhancements for non-3GPP accesses (e.g.,
   via IEEE technology) are described containing the concept that EPS
   supports both IETF-based network- and host-based mobility management
   mechanisms (e.g., PMIP, MIP) via several interfaces.

   PCRF is the element for dynamic control of policy and charging
   required for QoS preservation.  Interface between PDN Gateway and
   serving Access Gateway which is S5 in case of same operator and S8 in
   case of different operators for 3G and non 3G access is assumed to be
   PMIP-based.  Then serving Access Gateway is a Mobile Access Gateway
   (MAG) according to PMIPv6 [RFC5213] but needs not to.  The PDN GW
   includes the LMA functionality according to PMIPv6 [RFC5213].
   According to 3GPP TS 23.402 [23402] the Serving GW does not require
   full MAG and full LMA functionality.

              Figure 3: MBMS architecture for LTE 3GPP eUTRAN

   The eBM-SC (evolved Broadcast-Multicast Service Centre) uses both
   MBMS Bearers and EPS Bearers (over two different interfaces between
   MBMS2 and eMB-SC).  MBMS1 functions include:
   o  Session control of MBMS bearers to the E-UTRAN access (including
      reliable delivery of Session Start/Session Stop to E-UTRAN);
   o  Transmision of Session control messages towards multiple eNBs;
   o  Provision of an interface to the MBMS2 function: it receives MBMS
      service control messages and the IP Multicast address for MBMS
      data reception from MBMS2 function over this interface.

   MBMS2 functions include:
   o  Provision of an interface for entities using MBMS bearers (via
      eMB-SC) through user plane and control plane reference points
   o  IP multicast distribution of MBMS user plane data to eNB;
   o  Content synchronization for MBMS over Single Frequency Networks;
   o  Header compression for MBSFN MBMS data;
   o  Allocation of an IP Multicast address to which the eNB should join
      to receive the MBMS data.  This IP Multicast address is provided
      to the eNB via MBMS1 function;

   It is still under discussion how these functions are allocated to
   functional entity/entities of the Evolved Packet System.  The MCE
   (Multi-cell/Multicast Co-ordination Entity) is neither shown in the
   figure nor defined in 3GPP TS 23.246 [23246].

5.  IGMP/ MLD on IEEE 802.11 Links

   Multicast address mapping into Layer 2 MAC address for IEEE 802.11
   follows the Ethernet model.  The lower 23 bits of the 28-bit
   multicast IPv4 address are mapped into the 23 bits of available
   Ethernet address space.  Like in the case of IEEE 802.16e there is
   ambiguity in delivering packets which will result in delivering
   packets to hosts that subscribed to a different multicast group.

   MAC address corresponding to multicast IPv6 address is derived from
   the four low-order octets.  There is a similar problem of ambiguity
   in the delivery which requires the network software in the host to
   discard the packets from unsubscribed multicast groups.

   Without power save mode (dormant mode in 802.11) multicast packets
   are delivered after each beacon with a default interval of 100ms.  If
   power save mode is enabled, multicast traffic is delivered after 1,2,
   or 3 beacon intervals.  Therefore beacon interval settings and
   Delivery Traffic Indication Message (DTIM) should be adjusted for
   optimum performance.

   802.11 access points support different data rates.  For multicast
   traffic the lowest rates, e.g. 1Mbps are chosen to accomodate various
   group members.

   As in 802.16e, IGMP/MLD unsolicited membership report messages would
   either wake up the mobile in power save mode because DTIM period is
   usually smaller than power save period.

   As in 802.16e, authentication support and security are needed in
   IGMP/MLD especially for enterprise wireless LANs.


6.  Security Considerations

   This draft introduces no additional messages.  Compared to [RFC3376],
   [RFC3810] and [RFC3775] there is no additional threats to be
