                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
  A default Bandwidth Constraints model for Diff-Serv-aware Traffic 
  Engineering (the Russian Dolls model) is also specified. 
   
   
1.      Introduction 
 
  [DSTE-REQ] presents the Service Providers requirements for support of 
  Diff-Serv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE). This includes the 
  fundamental requirement to be able to enforce different bandwidth 
  constraints for different classes of traffic. 
   
  This document specifies: 
        - the IGP and signaling extensions and procedures (beyond those 
          already specified for existing MPLS Traffic Engineering 
          [OSPF-TE][ISIS-TE][RSVP-TE][CR-LDP]) for support of the DS-TE 
          requirements [DSTE-REQ] in environments relying on 
          distributed Constraint Based Routing (i.e. path computation 
          involving Head-end LSRs). 
        - A default Bandwidth Constraint Model for DS-TE called the 
          Russian Dolls model. While DS-TE implementations may support 
          other Bandwidth Constraints model, they must all support the 
          Russian Dolls model to ensure interoperability across all 
          implementations.  
   
   
2.      Definitions 
   
  [DSTE-REQ] discusses how a Head-end LSR may split the set of Ordered 
  Aggregates from the traffic to a given Tail-end into multiple Traffic 
  Trunks. Each Traffic Trunk is transported over a separate LSP which 
  is Constraint Based Routed individually. 
   
  For readability a number of definitions from [DSTE-REQ] are repeated 
  here: 
   
  Traffic Trunk: an aggregation of traffic flows of the same class 
  [i.e. which are to be treated equivalently from the DS-TE 
  perspective] which are placed inside a Label Switched Path. 
   
  Class-Type (CT): the set of Traffic Trunks crossing a link that is 
  governed by  a specific set of Bandwidth constraints. CT is used for 
  the purposes of link bandwidth allocation, constraint based routing 
  and admission control. A given Traffic Trunk belongs to the same CT 
  on all links. A given Traffic Trunk belongs to the same CT on all 
  links. 
   
  TE-Class: A pair of: 
             i. a Class-Type 
            ii. a preemption priority allowed for that Class-Type. This 
                means that an LSP transporting a Traffic Trunk from 
                that Class-Type can use that preemption priority as the 
                set-up priority, as the holding priority or both.

3.      Configurable Parameters 
   
  This section only discusses the differences with the configurable 
  parameters supported for MPLS Traffic Engineering as per [TE-REQ], 
  [ISIS-TE], [OSPF-TE], [RSVP-TE] and [CR-LDP]. All other parameters 
  are unchanged. 
   
3.1.    Link Parameters 
   
3.1.1.  Bandwidth Constraints (BCs) 
   
  [DSTE-REQTS] states that "Regardless of the Bandwidth Constraint 
  Model, the DS-TE solution must allow support for up to 8 BCs." 
   
  For DS-TE, the existing "Maximum Reservable link bandwidth" parameter 
  is retained but its semantic is generalized and interpreted as BC0. 
   
  Additionally, on every link, a DS-TE implementation MUST provide for 
  configuration of up to 7 additional link parameters which are the 
  seven other potential Bandwidth Constraints i.e. BC1, BC2 , ... BC7.  
   
  The LSR MUST interpret these Bandwidth Constraints in accordance with 
  the supported Bandwidth Constraint Model (i.e. what bandwidth 
  constraint applies to what Class-Type and how). 
   
  Where the Bandwidth Constraint Model imposes some relationship among 
  the values to be configured for these Bandwidth Constraints, the LSR 
  MUST enforce those at configuration time. For example, with the 
  "Russian Doll" Bandwidth Constraints Model defined below in section 
  9, the LSR must ensure that BCi is configured smaller or equal to 
  BCj, where i is greater than j.  
   
3.1.2.  per-CT Local Overbooking Multipliers (LOMs) 
   
  DS-TE enables a network administrator to apply different overbooking 
  (or underbooking) ratios for different CTs.  
   
  The principal method to achieve this is the same as historically used 
  in existing TE deployment, which is : 
  (i)    to take into account the over-booking/underbooking ratio 
          appropriate for the OA/CT associated with the considered LSP 
          at the time of establishing the bandwidth size of a given 
          LSP, AND/OR 
  (ii)   to take into account the overbooking/underbooking ratio at 
          the time of configuring the Maximum Reservable 
          Bandwidth/Bandwidth Constraints and/or the Maximum Link 
          Bandwidth (which effectively controls the maximum size of an 
          individual LSP) and use values which are larger(overbooking) 
          or smaller(underbooking) than the actual link. 
  We refer to this method as the "LSP/link size overbooking" method. 
 
 Le Faucheur et. al                                                  3 
 








 
                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
   
  The "LSP/link size overbooking" method is expected to be often 
  sufficient in many DS-TE environments and requires no additional 
  configurable parameters. 
   
  However, in the particular DS-TE environments where, for a given CT, 
  the overbooking ratio needs to be tweaked differently on different 
  links and where a very fine accounting of overbooking cross-effect 
  across Class-Types is required, a DS-TE implementation MAY optionally 
  support the "local overbooking" method as a complement to the 
  "LSP/link size overbooking" method. The "local overbooking" method 
  relies on optional "per-CT Local Overbooking Multipliers" (LOMs) 
  which are configurable, on every link, for every CT. The per-CT Local 
  Overbooking Multiplier effectively allows the network operator to 
  increase/decrease", on some links, the overbooking ratio already 
  enforced by the "LSP/link size overbooking" method. This is achieved 
  by factoring the per-CT LOM in all local bandwidth accounting for the 
  purposes of admission control and IGP advertisement of unreserved 
  bandwidths. Exact details on how the LOMs need to be factored in 
  depend on the Bandwidth Constraints model. This is discussed for the 
  Russian Dolls model in section 9. 
   
  Since the per-CT Local Overbooking Multipliers are factored in the 
  IGP advertisement of unreserved bandwidth by the local LSR, a remote 
  LSR computing a path for a DS-TE tunnel need not be aware that local 
  overbooking is used on the considered link. In fact, the remote LSR 
  does not even need to support the optional local overbooking method. 
  In any case, the remote LSR will compute a path that effectively 
  takes into account the LOMs on the considered link because it bases 
  its computation on advertised unreserved bandwidth which do factor in 
  the LOMs for that link. 
   
3.2.    LSR Parameters 
   
3.2.1.  TE-Class Mapping 
   
  In line with [DSTE-REQ], the preemption attributes defined in [TE-
  REQ] are retained with DS-TE and applicable across all Class Types. 
  The preemption attributes of setup priority and holding priority 
  retain existing semantics, and in particular these semantics are not 
  affected by the Ordered Aggregate transported by the LSP or by the 
  LSP's Class Type. This means that if LSP1 contends with LSP2 for 
  resources, LSP1 may preempt LSP2 if LSP1 has a higher set-up 
  preemption priority (i.e. lower numerical priority value) than LSP2's 
  holding preemption priority regardless of LSP1's OA/CT and LSP2's 
  OA/CT. 
   
  For DS-TE, LSRs MUST allow configuration of a TE-Class mapping 
  whereby the Class-Type and preemption level are configured for each 
  of (up to) 8 TE-Classes. 
   
  This mapping is referred to as : 
 
 Le Faucheur et. al                                                  4 
 








 
                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
   
       TE-Class[i]  <-->  < CTc , preemption p >  
   
  Where 0 <= i <= 7, 0 <= c <= 7, 0 <= p <= 7 
   
   
  Two TE-Classes must not be identical (i.e. have both the same Class-
  Type and the same preemption priority). 
   
  Where the network administrator uses less than 8 TE-Classes, the DS-
  TE LSR MUST allow remaining ones to be configured as "Unused". 
   
  There are no other restrictions on how any of the 8 Class-Types can 
  be paired up with any of the 8 preemption priorities to form a TE-
  class. In particular, one given preemption priority can be paired up 
  with two (or more) different Class-Types to form two (or more) TE-
  classes. Similarly, one Class-Type can be paired up with two (or 
  more) different preemption priorities to form two (or more) TE-
  Classes. Also, there is no mandatory ordering relationship between 
  the TE-Class index (i.e. "i" above) and the Class-Type (i.e. "c" 
  above) or the preemption priority (i.e. "p" above) of the TE-Class. 
   
  To ensure coherent DS-TE operation, the network administrator MUST 
  configure exactly the same TE-Class Mapping on all LSRs of the DS-TE 
  domain. 
   
  When the TE-class mapping needs to be modified in the DS-TE domain, 
  care must be exercised during the transient period of reconfiguration 
  during which some DS-TE LSRs may be configured with the new TE-class 
  mapping while others are still configured with the old TE-class 
  mapping. It is recommended that active tunnels do not use any of the  
  TE-classes which are being modified during such a transient 
  reconfiguration period. 
 
3.3.    LSP Parameters 
   
3.3.1.  Class-Type 
   
  With DS-TE, LSRs MUST support, for every LSP, an additional 
  configurable parameter which indicates the Class-Type of the Traffic 
  Trunk transported by the LSP.  
   
  There is one and only one Class-Type configured per LSP. 
   
  The configured Class-Type indicates, in accordance with the supported 
  Bandwidth Constraint Model, what are the Bandwidth Constraints 
  applicable to that LSP. 
   
3.3.2.  Setup and Holding Preemption Priorities 
   
  As per existing TE, DS-TE assumes that every DS-TE LSP is configured 
  with a setup and holding priority, each with a value between 0 and 7.  
 
 Le Faucheur et. al                                                  5 
 








 
                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
   
3.3.3.  Class-Type/Preemption Relationship 
   
  With DS-TE, the preemption priority configured for the setup priority 
  of a given LSP and the Class-Type configured for that LSP  must be 
  such that, together, they form one of the (up to) 8 TE-Classes 
  configured in the TE-Class Mapping specified is section 3.2.1 above. 
   
  The LSR MUST enforce this rule at configuration time. 
   
  The preemption priority configured for the holding priority of a 
  given LSP and the Class-Type configured for that LSP must also be 
  such that, together, they form one of the (up to) 8 TE-Classes 
  configured in the TE-Class Mapping specified is section 3.2.1 above. 
   
  The LSR MUST enforce this rule at configuration time. 
   
3.4.    Examples of Parameters Configuration 
   
  For illustrative purposes, we now present a few examples of how these 
  configurable parameters may be used. All these examples assume that 
  different bandwidth constraints need to be enforced for different 
  sets of Traffic Trunks (e.g. for Voice and for Data) so that two, or 
  more, Class-Types must be used. 
   
3.4.1.  Example 1 
   
  The Network Administrator of a first network using two Class Types 
  (CT1 for Voice and CT0 for Data), may elect to configure the 
  following TE-Class Mapping to ensure that Voice LSPs are never driven 
  away from their shortest path because of Data LSPs: 
        
       TE-Class[0]  <-->  < CT1 , preemption 0 >  
       TE-Class[1]  <-->  < CT0 , preemption 1 >  
       TE-Class[i]  <-->  unused,   for 2 <= i <= 7  
   
  Voice LSPs would then be configured with: 
        - CT=CT1, set-up priority =0, holding priority=0 
   
  Data LSPs would then be configured with: 
        - CT=CT0, set-up priority =1, holding priority=1 
   
  A new Voice LSP would then be able to preempt an existing Data LSP in 
  case they contend for resources. A Data LSP would never preempt a 
  Voice LSP. A Voice LSP would never preempt another Voice LSP. A Data 
  LSP would never preempt another Data LSP. 
   
3.4.2.  Example 2 
   
  The Network Administrator of another network may elect to configure 
  the following TE-Class Mapping in order to optimize global network

  resource utilization by favoring placement of large LSPs closer to 
  their shortest path: 
   
       TE-Class[0]  <-->  < CT1 , preemption 0 >  
       TE-Class[1]  <-->  < CT0 , preemption 1 >  
       TE-Class[2]  <-->  < CT1 , preemption 2 >  
       TE-Class[3]  <-->  < CT0 , preemption 3 >  
       TE-Class[i]  <-->  unused,   for 4 <= i <= 7  
   
  Large size Voice LSPs could be configured with: 
        - CT=CT1, set-up priority =0, holding priority=0 
   
  Large size Data LSPs could be configured with: 
        - CT=CT0, set-up priority = 1, holding priority=1 
   
  Small size Voice LSPs could be configured with: 
        - CT=CT1, set-up priority = 2, holding priority=2 
 
  Small size Data LSPs could be configured with: 
        - CT=CT0, set-up priority = 3, holding priority=3. 
 
  A new large size Voice LSP would then be able to preempt a small size 
  Voice LSP or any Data LSP in case they contend for resources. 
  A new large size Data LSP would then be able to preempt a small size 
  Data LSP or a small size Voice LSP in case they contend for 
  resources, but it would not be able to preempt a large size Voice 
  LSP. 
   
3.4.3.  Example 3 
   
  The Network Administrator of another network may elect to configure 
  the following TE-Class Mapping in order to ensure that Voice LSPs are 
  never driven away from their shortest path because of Data LSPs while 
  also achieving some optimization of global network resource 
  utilization by favoring placement of large LSPs closer to their 
  shortest path: 
   
       TE-Class[0]  <-->  < CT1 , preemption 0 >  
       TE-Class[1]  <-->  < CT1 , preemption 1 >  
       TE-Class[2]  <-->  < CT0 , preemption 2 >  
       TE-Class[3]  <-->  < CT0 , preemption 3 >  
       TE-Class[i]  <-->  unused,   for 4 <= i <= 7  
   
  Large size Voice LSPs could be configured with: 
        - CT=CT1, set-up priority = 0, holding priority=0. 
 
  Small size Voice LSPs could be configured with: 
        - CT=CT1, set-up priority = 1, holding priority=1. 
 
  Large size Data LSPs could be configured with: 
        - CT=CT0, set-up priority = 2, holding priority=2.

  Small size Data LSPs could be configured with: 
        - CT=CT0, set-up priority = 3, holding priority=3. 
   
  A Voice LSP could preempt a Data LSP if they contend for resources. A 
  Data LSP would never preempt a Voice LSP. A Large size Voice LSP 
  could preempt a small size Voice LSP if they contend for resources. A 
  Large size Data LSP could preempt a small size Data LSP if they 
  contend for resources. 
 
3.4.4.  Example 4 
 
  The Network Administrator of another network may elect to configure 
  the following TE-Class Mapping in order to ensure that no preemption 
  occurs in the DS-TE domain: 
   
       TE-Class[0]  <-->  < CT1 , preemption 0 >  
       TE-Class[1]  <-->  < CT0 , preemption 0 >  
       TE-Class[i]  <-->  unused,   for 2 <= i <= 7  
        
  Voice LSPs would then be configured with: 
        - CT=CT1, set-up priority =0, holding priority=0 
   
  Data LSPs would then be configured with: 
        - CT=CT0, set-up priority =0, holding priority=0 
   
  No LSP would then be able to preempt any other LSP. 
 
3.4.5.  Example 5 
 
  The Network Administrator of another network may elect to configure 
  the following TE-Class Mapping in view of increased network stability 
  through a more limited use of preemption: 
   
       TE-Class[0]  <-->  < CT1 , preemption 0 >  
       TE-Class[1]  <-->  < CT1 , preemption 1 >  
       TE-Class[2]  <-->  < CT0 , preemption 1 >  
       TE-Class[3]  <-->  < CT0 , preemption 2 >  
       TE-Class[i]  <-->  unused,   for 4 <= i <= 7  
   
  Large size Voice LSPs could be configured with: 
        - CT=CT1, set-up priority = 0, holding priority=0. 
         
  Small size Voice LSPs could be configured with: 
        - CT=CT1, set-up priority = 1, holding priority=0. 
         
  Large size Data LSPs could be configured with: 
        - CT=CT0, set-up priority = 2, holding priority=1. 
   
  Small size Data LSPs could be configured with: 
       - CT=CT0, set-up priority = 2, holding priority=2.

4.      IGP Advertisement 
   
  This section only discusses the differences with the IGP 
  advertisement supported for MPLS Traffic Engineering as per [OSPF-TE] 
  and [ISIS-TE]. The rest of the IGP advertisement is unchanged. 
   
4.1.    Bandwidth Constraints  
   
  As detailed above in section 3.1.1, up to 8 Bandwidth Constraints ( 
  BCb, 0 <= b <= 7) are configurable on any given link. 
   
  With DS-TE, the existing "Maximum Reservable Bw" sub-TLV is retained 
  with a generalized semantic so that it is now interpreted as 
  Bandwidth Constraint 0 (BC0). 
   
  DS-TE also defines the following optional sub-TLV to advertise the 
  eight potential Bandwidth Constraints (BC0 to BC7): 
   
  "Bandwidth Constraints" sub-TLV: 
       TBD - Bandwidth Constraint Model Id (1 octet) 
            - Bandwidth Constraints (Nx4 octets) 
   
  Where: 
   
        - Bandwidth Constraint Model Id: 1 octet identifier for the 
          Bandwidth Constraints Model currently in use by the LSR 
          initiating the IGP advertisement. 
          Values 0 to 127 are to be allocated by the TEWG to identify 
          Bandwidth Constraints Models defined in the TEWG. Value 0 
          identifies the Russian Doll Bandwidth Constraint Model 
          defined in section 9. 
          Values 128 to 255 are for experimental use. 
                 
        - Bandwidth Constraints: contains BC0, BC1,... BCN-1.  
          Each Bandwidth Constraint is encoded in 32 bits in IEEE   
          floating point format. The units are bytes (not bits!) per 
          second. It is recommended that only the Bandwidth Constraints 
          corresponding to active CTs be advertised in order to 
          minimize the impact on IGP scalability. 
         
  A DS-TE LSR MAY optionally advertise Bandwidth Constraints.

                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
   
  A DS-TE LSR which does advertise Bandwidth Constraints MUST use the 
  new "Bandwidth Constraints" sub-TLV to do so. For example, where a 
  Service Provider deploys DS-TE with two active CTs, only two 
  Bandwidth Constraints per link would be meaningful (assuming, for 
  instance, the Russian Doll Bandwidth Constraint Model defined in 
  section 9). A DS-TE LSR which does advertise Bandwidth Constraint 
  would include the "Bandwidth Constraints" sub-TLV in the IGP 
  advertisement and this should contain BC0 and BC1.  
   
  A DS-TE LSR which does advertise Bandwidth Constraints, MAY also 
  include the existing "Maximum Reservable Bw" sub-TLV. This may be 
  useful in migration situations where some LSRs in the network are not 
  DS-TE capable (see Appendix G) and thus do not understand the new 
  "Bandwidth Constraints" sub-TLV. IN that case, the DS-TE LSR MUST set 
  the value of the "Maximum Reservable Bw" sub-TLV to the same value as 
  the one for BC0 encoded in the "Bandwidth Constraints" sub-TLV. 
   
  A DS-TE LSR receiving both the old "Maximum Reservable Bw" sub-TLV 
  and the new "Bandwidth Constraints" sub-TLV for a given link MAY 
  ignore the "Maximum Reservable Bw" sub-TLV. 
   
  A DS-TE LSR receiving the "Bandwidth Constraints" sub-TLV with a 
  Bandwidth Constraint Model Id which does not match the Bandwidth 
  Constraint Model it currently uses, MAY generate a warning to the 
  operator reporting the inconsistency between Bandwidth Constraint 
  Models used on different links. If the DS-TE LSR does not support the 
  Bandwidth Constraint Model designated by the Bandwidth Constraint 
  Model Id, or if the DS-TE LSR does not support operations with 
  multiple simultaneous Bandwidth Constraint Models, the DS-TE LSR MAY 
  ignore the corresponding TLV.  
   
4.2.    Unreserved Bandwidth 
   
  With DS-TE, the existing "Unreserved Bandwidth" sub-TLV is retained 
  as the only vehicle to advertise dynamic bandwidth information 
  necessary for Constraint Based Routing on Head-ends, except that it 
  is used with a generalized semantic. The Unreserved Bandwidth sub-TLV 
  still carries eight bandwidth values but they now correspond to the 
  unreserved bandwidth for each of the TE-Class (instead of for each 
  preemption as per existing TE).  
   
  More precisely, a DS-TE LSR MUST support the Unreserved Bandwidth 
  sub-TLV with a definition which is generalized into the following:  
   
  The Unreserved Bandwidth sub-TLV specifies the amount of bandwidth 
  not yet reserved for each of the eight TE-classes, in IEEE floating 
  point format arranged in increasing order of TE-Class index, with 
  unreserved bandwidth for TE-Class [0] occurring at the start of the 
  sub-TLV, and unreserved bandwidth for TE-Class [7] at the end of the 
  sub-TLV. The unreserved bandwidth value for TE-Class [i] ( 0 <= i <= 

 
 Le Faucheur et. al                                                 10 
 








 
                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
  7) is referred to as "Unreserved TE-Class [i]". It indicates the 
  bandwidth that is available, for reservation, to an LSP which : 
        - transports a Traffic Trunk from the Class-Type of TE-
          Class[i], and  
        - has a setup priority corresponding to the preemption priority 
          of TE-Class[i]. 
   
  The units are bytes per second. 
   
  Since the bandwidth values are now ordered by TE-class index and thus 
  can relate to different CTs with different bandwidth constraints and 
  can relate to any arbitrary preemption priority, a DS-TE LSR MUST NOT 
  assume any ordered relationship among these bandwidth.  
   
  With existing TE, since all preemption priorities reflect the same 
  (and only) bandwidth constraints and since bandwidth values are 
  advertised in preemption priority order, the following relationship 
  is always true, and is often assumed by TE implementations: 
   
      If i < j , then "Unreserved Bw [i]" >= "Unreserved Bw [j]" 
   
  With DS-TE, no relationship is to be assumed so that: 
       If i < j , then  
                "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" = "Unreserved TE-Class [j]" 
                    OR 
                "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" > "Unreserved TE-Class [j]" 
                    OR 
                "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" < "Unreserved TE-Class [j]". 
 
  Since some Bandwidth Constraints Models are such that a given Class-
  Type is constrained by multiple Bandwidth Constraints (as in the case 
  of the Russian Doll Bandwidth Constraint Model specified in section 
  9), the value to be advertised by the IGP in "Unreserved TE-Class 
  [i]" MUST reflect all of the Bandwidth Constraints relevant to the CT 
  associated with TE-Class [i]. 
   
  If TE-Class[i] is unused, the value advertised by the IGP in 
  "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" MUST be set to zero. 
   
4.3.    Local Overbooking Multiplier 
   
  The following additional optional sub-TLV is defined for DS-TE: 
   
  "Local Overbooking Multiplier" sub-TLV: 
        TBD - per-CT Local Overbooking Multipliers (N x 2 octets). 
             Each LOM is encoded as an integer in the range   
             [ 0 , (2^16 -1) ] that represents LOM expressed in 
             percentage. For example, a LOM of 1 (i.e. 100%) is encoded 
             as 100, and represents no overbooking/underbooking. A LOM 
             of 2 (i.e. 200%) is encoded as 200, and represents an 
             overbooking of 2. A LOM of 0.5 (i.e. 50%) is encoded as 50 
             and represents an underbooking of 2. 
 
 Le Faucheur et. al                                                 11 
 








 
                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
              
   
  where N is the number of per-CT Local Overbooking Multipliers 
  actually advertised. It is recommended that only the LOMs 
  corresponding to active CTs be included, in order to minimize the 
  impact on IGP scalability. 
   
  A DS-TE LSR supporting the optional local overbooking method MAY 
  optionally advertise LOMs. A DS-TE LSR which does advertise LOMs MUST 
  use the "Local Overbooking Multiplier" sub-TLV to do so. 
   
  For example, where a Service Provider only deploys DS-TE with two CTs 
  and makes use of the Local Overbooking method, the "Local Overbooking 
  Multiplier" sub-TLV may optionally be used and would then contain 
  only LOM[0] and LOM[1. 
   
  Note that the use of this sub-TLV is only optional even when the 
  optional Local Overbooking method is actually used (and thus when the 
  Local Overbooking Multipliers parameters are actually configured 
  locally on some or all links). Its use may assist in head-end 
  prediction of network response to LSP establishment.  
   
   
5.      LSP Signaling 
   
  This section only describes the signaling extensions beyond those 
  already specified for MPLS Traffic Engineering as per [RSVP-TE] and 
  [CR-LDP] and for Diff-Serv over MPLS as per [DIFF-MPLS]. 
   
  The Class-Type of the LSP is signaled in RSVP-TE and CR-LDP for DS-TE 
  in order for LSRs to enforce the appropriate bandwidth constraint(s) 
  for admission control and bandwidth accounting. 
   
  Protocol and procedure extensions for signaling of the Class-Type are 
  specified in details in Appendix A and B respectively for RSVP-TE and 
  CR-LDP. 
   
  A DS-TE implementation based on RSVP-TE MUST support the protocol and 
  procedure extensions specified in Appendix A. 
   
  A DS-TE implementation based on CR-LDP MUST support the protocol and 
  procedure extensions specified in Appendix B. 
   
   
6.      Constraint Based Routing 
      
  Let us consider the case where a path needs to be computed for an LSP 
  whose Class-Type is configured to CTc and whose set-up preemption 
  priority is configured to p. 
   


 
 Le Faucheur et. al                                                 12 
 








 
                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
  Then the pair of CTc and p will map to one of the TE-Classes defined 
  in the TE-Class mapping. Let us assume that this is the i-th TE-Class 
  i.e. TE-Class[i]. 
   
  The Constraint Based Routing algorithm of a DS-TE LSR is still only 
  required to perform path computation satisfying a single bandwidth 
  constraint which is to fit in "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" as advertised 
  by the IGP for every link. Thus, no changes are required to the 
  existing TE Constraint Based Routing algorithm itself. 
   
  The Constraint Based Routing algorithm MAY also optionally take into 
  account, when used, the optional information advertised in IGP which 
  are the Bandwidth Constraints and the Local Overbooking Multipliers. 
  As an example, the Bandwidth Constraints MIGHT be used as a tie-
  breaker criteria in situations where multiple paths, otherwise 
  equally attractive, are possible.  
 
 
7.      Diff-Serv scheduling 
   
  The Class-Type signaled at LSP establishment MAY optionally be used 
  by DS-TE LSRs to dynamically adjust the resources allocated to the 
  Class-Type by the Diff-Serv scheduler. In addition, the Diff-Serv 
  information (i.e. the PSC) signaled by the TE-LSP signaling protocols 
  as specified in [DIFF-MPLS], if used, MAY optionally be used by DS-TE 
  LSRs to dynamically adjust the resources allocated to a PSC/OA within 
  a Class Type by the Diff-Serv scheduler. 
   
   
8.      Existing TE as a Particular Case of DS-TE 
   
  We observe that existing TE can be viewed as a particular case of DS-
  TE where: 
   
        (i) a single Class-Type is used, all 8 preemption priorities 
           are allowed for that Class-Type and the following TE-Class 
           Mapping is used: 
         
                TE-Class[i]  <-->  < CT0 , preemption i >  
                Where 0 <= i <= 7. 
         
        (ii) optional per-CT Local Overbooking Multipliers are not 
           used. 
   
  In that case, DS-TE behaves as existing TE.  
   
  As with existing TE, the IGP advertises: 
        - Unreserved Bandwidth for each of the 8 preemption priorities 
        - Max Link Bandwidth 
   
  As with existing TE, the IGP may also optionally advertise BC0 = 
  Maximum Reservable Bandwidth.

                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
   
  Note that, unlike with existing TE, the IGP will also advertise the 
  Bandwidth Constraint sub-TLV (which will contain BC0). 
    
  Since all LSPs transport traffic from CT0, LSP Signaling is done 
  without explicit signaling of the Class-Type (which is only used for 
  other Class-Types than CT0 as explained in Appendix A and B). 
   
 
9.      Russian Doll Bandwidth Constraints Model 
   
9.1.    Definition 
   
  [DSTE-REQ] introduces the concept of Bandwidth Constraints Models to 
  characterize the Bandwidth Constraints associated with CTs, but it 
  does not actually select one particular Model. 
   
  [DSTE-REQ] also requires that a default Bandwidth Constraints Model 
  be specified. The purpose of such a default Model is to ensure that 
  there is at least one common Bandwidth Constraints model supported 
  across all DS-TE implementations to allow for easier deployment of 
  DS-TE.  
   
  This section specifies a default Bandwidth Constraints Model which is 
  referred to as the "Russian Dolls" Bandwidth Constraints model. DS-TE 
  implementations MUST support the Russian Dolls models and MAY also 
  optionally support other Bandwidth Constraints Models. 
   
  The "Russian Dolls" model is defined in the following manner 
  (assuming that the optional per-CT Local Overbooking Multipliers are 
  not used - i.e. LOM[c]=1 , 0<=c<=7 ): 
             o Maximum Number of Bandwidth Constraints (MaxBC)= Maximum 
               Number of Class-Types (MaxCT) = 8 
             o All LSPs supporting Traffic Trunks from CTc (with 
               b<=c<=7) use no more than BCb i.e.: 
                  - All LSPs from CT7 use no more than BC7 
                  - All LSPs from CT6 and CT7 use no more than BC6 
                  - All LSPs from CT5, CT6 and CT7 use no more than BC5 
                  - etc. 
                  - All LSPs from CT0, CT1,... CT7 use no more than BC0 
   
  Purely for illustration purposes, the diagram below represents the 
  Russian Doll Bandwidth Constraints model in a pictorial manner when 3 
  Class-Types are active: 
   
  I------------------------------------------------------I 
  I-------------------------------I                      I

  I    CT2       I    CT2+CT1     I      CT2+CT1+CT0     I 
  I--------------I                I                      I 
  I-------------------------------I                      I 
  I------------------------------------------------------I

  I---------------------------------------------BC0------> 
   
   
  While simpler or, conversely, more flexible/sophisticated Bandwidth 
  Constraints models can be defined, the Russian Dolls model is an 
  attractive trade-off for the following reasons: 
       - Network administrators generally find it superior to the most 
          basic model of a single independent BC per CT (which, in 
          typical deployment scenarios, results in either capacity 
          wastage, low priority Traffic Trunk starvation and/or 
          degradation of QoS objectives) 
       - network administrators generally find it sufficient for the 
          real life deployments currently anticipated (e.g. it 
          addresses all the scenarios described in [DSTE-REQ]) 
       - it remains simple and only requires limited protocol 
          extensions, while more sophisticated Bandwidth Constraints 
          model may require more complex extensions. 
   
  More details on the properties of the Russian Dolls model can be 
  found in [RUSSIAN] and [BCMODEL]. 
   
  As an example usage of the "Russian Doll" Bandwidth Constraints 
  Model, a network administrator using one CT for Voice (CT1) and one 
  CT for data (CT0) might configure on a given link: 
        - BC0 = 2.5 Gb/s (i.e. Voice + Data is limited to 2.5 Gb/s) 
        - BC1= 1.5 Gb/s (i.e. Voice is limited to 1.5 Gb/s). 
 
  Another (or other) Bandwidth Constraints Model(s) may be specified in 
  another (or other) document(s) to address other potential 
  requirements which may emerge from Service Providers real life 
  deployment and which cannot be efficiently addressed by the Russian 
  Dolls model. This is outside the scope of the current specification. 
   
  The Russian Doll Bandwidth Constraints Model can be supported with 
  the extensions defined earlier in this document for DS-TE. Note that 
  a number of other Bandwidth Constraints could also be supported with 
  these same extensions. Note also that not all Bandwidth Constraints 
  models could be supported with these extensions and some may require 
  additional or different extensions. Both of these situations are 
  beyond the scope of this specification. 
   
  Note that as per [DSTE-REQTS], while deployment of DS-TE is expected 
  to be easier when a single Bandwidth Constraints Model is used on all 
  the DS-TE LSRs of a DS-TE domain, the DS-TE solution itself does not 
  prevent a network operator to activate different Bandwidth 
  Constraints models on different links in a network, if he/she wishes 
  to do so and if the particular DS-TE LSR implementations allow this. 
 
9.2.    Computing "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" 
 
 Le Faucheur et. al                                                 15 
 








 
                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
   
  We first observe that, for existing TE, details on admission control 
  algorithms for TE LSPs, and consequently details on formulas for 
  computing the unreserved bandwidth, are outside the scope of the 
  current IETF work. This is left for vendor differentiation. Note that 
  this does not compromise interoperability across various 
  implementations since the TE schemes rely on LSRs to advertise their 
  local view of the world in terms of Unreserved Bw to other LSRs. This 
  way, regardless of the actual local admission control algorithm used 
  on one given LSR, Constraint Based Routing on other LSRs can rely on 
  advertised information to determine whether an additional LSP will be 
  accepted or rejected by the given LSR. The only requirement is that 
  an LSR advertises unreserved bandwidth values which are consistent 
  with its specific local admission control algorithm and take into 
  account the holding preemption priority of established LSPs. 
   
  In the context of DS-TE, again, details on admission control 
  algorithms are left for vendor differentiation and formulas for 
  computing the unreserved bandwidth for TE-Class[i] are outside the 
  scope of this specification. However, DS-TE places the additional 
  requirement on the LSR that the unreserved bandwidth values 
  advertised MUST reflect all of the Bandwidth Constraints relevant to 
  the CT associated with TE-Class[i], as discussed in section 4.2. 
   
  As with existing TE, DS-TE assumes that the holding preemption 
  priority of established LSPs is the one considered (as opposed to 
  their set-up preemption priority) for the purpose of computing the 
  unreserved bandwidth for TE-Class [i]. 
   
  Example formulas for computing "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" are provided 
  in Appendix C.  
   
9.3.    Admission Control Rules 
   
  A DS-TE LSR MUST support the following admission control rule: 
   
  Regardless of how the admission control algorithm actually computes 
  the unreserved bandwidth for TE-Class[i] for one of its local link, 
  an LSP of bandwidth B, of set-up preemption priority p and of Class-
  Type CTc is admissible on that link iff: 
   
       B <= unreserved bandwidth for TE-Class[i], AND 
       B <= Max Link Bandwidth 
           
        Where  
            
        - TE-Class [i] maps to  < CTc , p > in the LSR's configured TE-
          Class mapping 
        - Max Link Bandwidth is the maximum link bandwidth configured 
          on the link and advertised in IGP.

                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
  Note that this admission control rule assumes that the optional per-
  CT Local Overbooking Multipliers are not used (i.e. LOM[c]=1,  
  0<=c<= 7 ). 
   
9.4.    Support of Optional Local Overbooking Method 
   
We remind the reader that, as discussed in section 3.1.2, the "LSP/link 
size overbooking" method (which does not use the Local Overbooking 
Multipliers) is expected to be sufficient in many DS-TE environments. 
It is expected that the optional Local Overbooking method (and LOMs) 
would only be used in specific environments, in particular where 
different overbooking ratios need to be enforced on different links of 
the DS-TE domain and cross-effect of overbooking across CTs needs to be 
accounted for very accurately.  
 
This section discusses the impact of the optional local overbooking 
method on the Russian Dolls model and associated rules and formula. 
This is only applicable in the cases where the optional local 
overbooking method is indeed supported by the DS-TE LSRs and actually 
deployed.  
 
9.4.1.  Russian Dolls Model Definition 
   
  Let us define "Reserved(CTc)" as the sum of the bandwidth reserved by 
  all established LSPs which belong to CTc. 
   
  Let us define "Normalised(CTc)" as "Reserved(CTc)/LOM(c)".  
   
  When the optional Local Overbooking method is supported, the "Russian 
  Doll" model definition MUST be extended in the following manner: 
        - Maximum Number of Bandwidth Constraints (MaxBC)= Maximum 
          Number of Class-Types (MaxCT) = 8 
        - SUM [ Normalised(CTc), for b<=c<=7 ] <= BCb i.e.: 
              o [ Normalised(CT7) ] <= BC7 
              o [ Normalised(CT6) + Normalised(CT7) ] <= BC6  
              o [ Normalised(CT5) + Normalised(CT6) + 
                  Normalised(CT7) ] <= BC5 
              o etc. 
              o [ Normalised(CT0) + Normalised(CT1) + 
                  ... 
                  Normalised(CT6) + Normalised(CT7) ] <= BC0 
         
  Purely for illustration purposes, the diagram below represents the 
  Russian Doll Bandwidth Constraints model in a pictorial manner when 3 
  Class-Types are active and the local overbooking method is used: 
   
  I--------------------------------------------------------------I 
  I-----------------------------------------I  Normalised(CT2)   I 
  I--------------------I  Normalised(CT2)   I       +            I                   
  I  Normalised(CT2)   I        +           I  Normalised(CT1)   I

9.4.2.  Bandwidth Constraints 
 
  When the optional Local Overbooking method is supported, the 
  relationship among the Bandwidth Constraints values to be enforced by 
  the LSR is not modified. The LSR MUST still ensure that BCi is 
  configured smaller or equal to BCj, where i is greater than j. 
   
  When the Bandwidth Constraints are optionally advertised in the 
  Bandwidth Constraints sub-TLV, the values advertised are the BC 
  values as configured (i.e. LOMs do not affect the advertisement of 
  BCs).  
   
9.4.3.  Computing "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" 
   
  As discussed in section 9.2, details on formulas for computing the 
  unreserved bandwidth, are outside the scope of the current IETF work. 
  However, when the Local Overbooking method is supported, the 
  advertised unreserved bandwidth values MUST reflect the per-CT Local 
  Overbooking Multipliers. This MUST be consistent with how the LOMs 
  are taken into account in the specific local admission control 
  algorithm.  
   
  Note that this may result in the Unreserved Bandwidth values 
  advertised for a particular CT being larger than one or more of the 
  BCs relevant to this CT (since BCs are not affected by LOMs). 
   
  Example formulas for computing "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" when local 
  overbooking is supported are provided in section 2 of Appendix C. 
   
9.4.4.  Max Link Bandwidth 
   
  The Max Link bandwidth parameter effectively controls the maximum 
  size of a single LSP. The value advertised in the Max Link Bandwidth 
  sub-TLV is the value as configured locally (i.e. LOMs do not affect 
  the advertisement of the Max Link Bandwidth). 
   
9.4.5.  Admission Control Rules 
   
  When the optional Local Overbooking method is supported, the DS-TE 
  LSR MUST support the same admission control rules as without LOM: 
   
  Regardless of how the admission control algorithm actually computes 
  the unreserved bandwidth for TE-Class[i] for one of its local link,

                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
  an LSP of bandwidth B, of set-up preemption priority p and of Class-
  Type CTc is admissible on that link iff: 
   
       (i)  B <= unreserved bandwidth for TE-Class[i], AND 
       (ii) B        <= Max Link Bandwidth 
           
        Where  
            
        - TE-Class [i] maps to  < CTc , p > in the LSR's configured TE-
          Class mapping 
        - Max Link Bandwidth is the maximum link bandwidth configured 
          on the link and advertised in IGP. 
  Condition (i) above applies to B [and not B/LOM(c) ] because the LOM 
  is already factored in the unreserved bandwidth values. 
   
  Condition (ii) above also applies to B [and not B/LOM(c) ]. Condition 
  (ii) controls the maximum bandwidth that a single LSP can grab on its 
  own, by limiting it to the Maximum Link Bandwidth. Since 
  "overbooking" is usually only (fully) achievable when a sufficient 
  number of LSPs share the Link Bandwidth, it is not appropriate to 
  factor in the LOM when assessing the maximum bandwidth that a single 
  LSP can grab on a link.  
   
9.4.6.  Example Usage of LOM 
   
  To illustrate usage of the local overbooking method, let's consider a 
  DS-TE deployment where two CTs (CT0 for data and CT1 for voice) and a 
  single preemption priority are used. 
   
  The TE-Class mapping is the following: 
   
       TE-Class  <-->  CT, preemption  
       ============================== 
           0           CT0, 0 
           1           CT1, 0 
           rest         unused 
   
  Let's assume that on a given link, BCs and LOMs are configured in the 
  following way: 
       BC0 = 200 
       BC1 = 100 
       LOM(0) = 4  (i.e. = 400%) 
       LOM(1) = 2  (i.e. = 200%) 
   
  Let's further assume that the DS-TE LSR uses the example formulas 
  presented in section 2 of Appendix C for computing unreserved 
  bandwidth values. 
   
  If there is no established LSP on the considered link, the LSR will 
  advertise for that link in IGP : 
          Unreserved TE-Class [0] = 4 x (200 - 0/4 - 0/2 )= 800 
          Unreserved TE-Class [1] = 2 x (100- 0/2) = 200 
 
 Le Faucheur et. al                                                 19 
 








 
                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
  Note again that these values advertised for Unreserved Bandwidth are 
  larger than BC1 and BC0. 
   
  If there is only a single established LSP, with CT=CT0 and BW=100, 
  the LSR will advertise: 
          Unreserved TE-Class [0] = 4 x (200 - 100/4 - 0/2 )=700 
          Unreserved TE-Class [1] = 2 x (100- 0/2) = 200 
   
  If there is only a single established LSP, with CT=CT1 and BW=100, 
  the LSR will advertise: 
          Unreserved TE-Class [0] = 4 x (200 - 0/4 - 100/2 )= 600 
          Unreserved TE-Class [1] = 2 x (100- 100/2) = 100 
  Note that the impact of an LSP on the unreserved bandwidth of a CT 
  does not depend only on the LOM for that CT: it also depends on the 
  LOM for the CT of the LSP. This can be seen in our example. A BW=100 
  tunnel affects Unreserved 
  CT0 twice as much if it is a CT1 tunnel, than if it is a CT0 tunnel.  
  It reduces Unreserved CTO by 200 (800->600) rather than by 100  
  (800->700). This is because LOM(1) is half as big as LOM(0). This 
  illustrates why the local overbooking method allows very fine 
  accounting of cross-effect of overbooking across CTs, as compared 
  with the LSP/link size overbooking method. 
   
  If there are two established LSPs, one with CT=CT1 and BW=100 and one 
  with CT=CT0 and BW=100, the LSR will advertise: 
       Unreserved TE-Class [0] = 4 x (200 - 100/4 - 100/2) = 500 
       Unreserved TE-Class [1] = 2 x (100 - 100/2) = 100 
   
  If there are two LSPs established, one with CT=CT1 and BW=100, and 
  one with CT=CT0 and BW=480, the LSR will advertise: 
          Unreserved TE-Class [0] = 4 x (200 - 480/4 - 100/2) = 120 
          Unreserved TE-Class [1] = 2 x MIN [ (200 - 480/4 - 100/2), 
                                               (100 - 100/2) ] 
                                  = 2 x MIN [ 30, 50 ] 
                                  = 60 
   
   
10.     Security Considerations 
   
  The solution is not expected to add specific security requirements 
  beyond those of Diff-Serv and existing TE. The security mechanisms 
  currently used with Diff-Serv and existing TE can be used with this 
  solution.

Appendix A - RSVP Extensions for Diff-Serv-aware TE 
   
  In this section we describe extensions to RSVP for support of    
  Diff-Serv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering. These extensions are in 
  addition to the extensions to RSVP defined in [RSVP-TE] for support 
  of (aggregate) MPLS Traffic Engineering and to the extensions to RSVP 
  defined in [DIFF-MPLS] for support of Diff-Serv over MPLS. 
   
1.      Diff-Serv-aware TE related RSVP Messages Format 
   
  One new RSVP Object is defined in this document: the CLASSTYPE 
  Object. Detailed description of this Object is provided below. This 
  new Object is applicable to Path messages. This specification only 
  defines the use of the CLASSTYPE Object in Path messages used to 
  establish LSP Tunnels in accordance with [RSVP-TE] and thus 
  containing a Session Object with a C-Type equal to LSP_TUNNEL_IPv4 
  and containing a LABEL_REQUEST object. 
   
  Restrictions defined in [RSVP-TE] for support of establishment of LSP 
  Tunnels via RSVP are also applicable to the establishment of LSP 
  Tunnels supporting Diff-Serv-aware Traffic Engineering. For instance, 
  only unicast LSPs are supported and Multicast LSPs are for further 
  study. 
   
  This new CLASSTYPE object is optional with respect to RSVP so that 
  general RSVP implementations not concerned with MPLS LSP set up do 
  not have to support this object. 
   
  An LSR supporting Diff-Serv-aware Traffic Engineering in compliance 
  with this specification MUST support the CLASSTYPE Object.

1.1.    Path Message Format 
   
  The format of the Path message is as follows: 
   
  <Path Message> ::=      <Common Header> [ <INTEGRITY> ] 
                           <SESSION> <RSVP_HOP> 
                           <TIME_VALUES> 
                           [ <EXPLICIT_ROUTE> ] 
                           <LABEL_REQUEST> 
                           [ <SESSION_ATTRIBUTE> ] 
                           [ <DIFFSERV> ] 
                           [ <CLASSTYPE> ] 
                           [ <POLICY_DATA> ... ] 
                           [ <sender descriptor> ] 
   
  <sender descriptor> ::=  <SENDER_TEMPLATE> [ <SENDER_TSPEC> ] 
                           [ <ADSPEC> ] 
                           [ <RECORD_ROUTE> ]  
   
2.      CLASSTYPE Object 
   
  The CLASSTYPE object format is shown below.   
   
2.1.    CLASSTYPE object 
   
  class = TBD, C_Type = 1  (need to get an official class num from the 
  IANA with the form 0bbbbbbb)

  Reserved : 29 bits 
       This field is reserved. It must be set to zero on transmission 
       and must be ignored on receipt.  
   
  CT : 3 bits 
       Indicates the Class-Type. Values currently allowed are 1, 2, ... 
       , 7. 
   
   
3.      Handling CLASSTYPE Object 
   
  To establish an LSP tunnel with RSVP, the sender LSR creates a Path 
  message with a session type of LSP_Tunnel_IPv4 and with a 
  LABEL_REQUEST object as per [RSVP-TE]. The sender LSR may also 
  include the DIFFSERV object as per [DIFF-MPLS]. 
   
 
 Le Faucheur et. al                                                 23 
 








 
                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
  If the LSP is associated with Class-Type 0, the sender LSR MUST NOT 
  include the CLASSTYPE object in the Path message. 
   
  If the LSP is associated with Class-Type N (1 <= N <=7), the sender 
  LSR MUST include the CLASSTYPE object in the Path message with the 
  Class-Type (CT) field set to N. 
   
  If a path message contains multiple CLASSTYPE objects, only the first 
  one is meaningful; subsequent CLASSTYPE object(s) MUST be ignored and 
  MUST not be forwarded. 
   
  Each LSR along the path MUST record the CLASSTYPE object, when 
  present, in its path state block. 
   
  If the CLASSTYPE object is not present in the Path message, the LSR 
  MUST associate the Class-Type 0 to the LSP. 
   
  The destination LSR responding to the Path message by sending a Resv 
  message MUST NOT include a CLASSTYPE object in the Resv message 
  (whether the Path message contained a CLASSTYPE object or not). 
   
  During establishment of an LSP corresponding to the Class-Type N, the 
  LSR MUST perform admission control over the bandwidth available for 
  that particular Class-Type. 
   
  An LSR that recognizes the CLASSTYPE object and that receives a path 
  message which contains the CLASSTYPE object but which does not 
  contain a LABEL_REQUEST object or which does not have a session type 
  of LSP_Tunnel_IPv4, MUST send a PathErr towards the sender with the 
  error code 'Diff-Serv-aware TE Error' and an error value of 
  'Unexpected CLASSTYPE object'. Those are defined below in section 5. 
   
  An LSR receiving a Path message with the CLASSTYPE object, which 
  recognizes the CLASSTYPE object but does not support the particular 
  Class-Type, MUST send a PathErr towards the sender with the error 
  code 'Diff-Serv-aware TE Error' and an error value of 'Unsupported 
  Class-Type'. Those are defined below in section 5. 
   
  An LSR receiving a Path message with the CLASSTYPE object, which 
  recognizes the CLASSTYPE object but determines that the Class-Type 
  value is not valid (i.e. Class-Type value 0), MUST send a PathErr 
  towards the sender with the error code 'Diff-Serv-aware TE Error' and 
  an error value of 'Invalid Class-Type value'. Those are defined below 
  in section 5. 
   
  An LSR receiving a Path message with the CLASSTYPE object, which: 
        - recognizes the CLASSTYPE object,  
        - supports the particular Class-Type, but  
        - determines that the tuple formed by (i) this Class-Type and 
          (ii) the set-up priority signaled in the same Path message,  
          is not one of the eight TE-classes configured in the TE-class 
          mapping,

                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
  MUST send a PathErr towards the sender with the error code 'Diff-
  Serv-aware TE Error' and an error value of 'CT and setup priority do 
  not form a configured TE-Class'. Those are defined below in section 
  5. 
   
  An LSR receiving a Path message with the CLASSTYPE object, which: 
        - recognizes the CLASSTYPE object,  
        - supports the particular Class-Type, but  
        - determines that the tuple formed by (i) this Class-Type and 
          (ii) the holding priority signaled in the same Path message,  
          is not one of the eight TE-classes configured in the TE-class 
          mapping, 
  MUST send a PathErr towards the sender with the error code 'Diff-
  Serv-aware TE Error' and an error value of 'CT and holding priority 
  do not form a configured TE-Class'. Those are defined below in 
  section 5. 
   
  An LSR receiving a Path message with the CLASSTYPE object and with 
  the DIFFSERV object for an L-LSP, which: 
        - recognizes the CLASSTYPE object,  
        - has local knowledge of the relationship between Class-Types 
          and PSC (e.g. via configuration) 
        - based on this local knowledge, determines that the PSC 
          signaled in the DIFFSERV object is inconsistent with the 
          Class-Type signaled in the CLASSTYPE object, 
  MUST send a PathErr towards the sender with the error code 'Diff-
  Serv-aware TE Error' and an error value of 'Inconsistency between 
  signaled PSC and signaled CT'. Those are defined below in section 5. 
   
  An LSR receiving a Path message with the CLASSTYPE object and with 
  the DIFFSERV object for an E-LSP, which: 
        - recognizes the CLASSTYPE object,  
        - has local knowledge of the relationship between Class-Types 
          and PHBs (e.g. via configuration) 
        - based on this local knowledge, determines that the PHBs 
          signaled in the MAP entries of the DIFFSERV object are 
          inconsistent with the Class-Type signaled in the CLASSTYPE 
          object, 
  MUST send a PathErr towards the sender with the error code 'Diff-
  Serv-aware TE Error' and an error value of 'Inconsistency between 
  signaled PHBs and signaled CT'. Those are defined below in section 5. 
   
  An LSR MUST handle the situations where the LSP can not be accepted 
  for other reasons than those already discussed in this section, in 
  accordance with [RSVP-TE] and [DIFF-MPLS] (e.g. a reservation is 
  rejected by admission control, a label can not be associated). 
   
4.      Non-support of the CLASSTYPE Object 
   
  An LSR that does not recognize the CLASSTYPE object Class-Num MUST 
  behave in accordance with the procedures specified in [RSVP] for an 
  unknown Class-Num whose format is 0bbbbbbb (i.e. it must send a

                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
  PathErr with the error code 'Unknown object class' toward the 
  sender).  
   
  An LSR that recognizes the CLASSTYPE object Class-Num but does not 
  recognize the CLASSTYPE object C-Type, MUST behave in accordance with 
  the procedures specified in [RSVP] for an unknown C-type (i.e. it 
  must send a PathErr with the error code 'Unknown object C-Type' 
  toward the sender).  
   
  In both situations, this causes the path set-up to fail. The sender 
  SHOULD notify management that a LSP cannot be established and 
  possibly might take action to retry reservation establishment without 
  the CLASSTYPE object. 
   
5.      Error Codes For Diff-Serv-aware TE 
   
  In the procedures described above, certain errors must be reported as 
  a 'Diff-Serv-aware TE Error'. The value of the 'Diff-Serv-aware TE

Appendix B - CR-LDP Extensions for Diff-Serv-aware TE 
   
  CR-LDP, defined in [CR-LDP], is an extension to LDP, defined in 
  [LDP], for support of (aggregate) MPLS Traffic Engineering. In this 
  section we describe extensions to CR-LDP for support of Diff-Serv-
  aware MPLS Traffic Engineering. These extensions are in addition to 
  the extensions to LDP defined in [DIFF-MPLS] for support of Diff-Serv 
  over MPLS. They closely resemble the extensions to RSVP defined in 
  the previous section.  
   
  Note that extensions of this section for support of Diff-Serv-aware 
  Traffic Engineering are not applicable to LDP due to the fact that 
  LDP does not support MPLS Traffic Engineering and bandwidth 
  reservation in particular. 
   
1.      Diff-Serv-aware TE related CR-LDP Messages Encoding 
   
  One new CR-LDP TLV is defined in this document: the Class Type TLV.

                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
  Detailed description of this TLV is provided below. This new TLV is 
  applicable to Label Request messages.  
   
  Restrictions defined in [CR-LDP] for support of establishment of LSPs 
  via CR-LDP are also applicable to the establishment of LSPs 
  supporting Diff-Serv-aware Traffic Engineering: for instance, only 
  unicast LSPs are supported and multicast LSPs are for further study. 
      
  This new Class Type TLV is optional with respect to CR-LDP so that 
  general CR-LDP implementations not concerned with Diff-Serv-aware 
  Traffic Engineering are not required to support this TLV.  
   
  An LSR supporting Diff-Serv-aware Traffic Engineering in compliance 
  with this specification MUST support the Class Type TLV. 
   
1.1.    Label Request Message Encoding 
   
  The encoding for the CR-LDP Label Request message is extended as 
  follows, to optionally include the Class Type TLV:  
    
     0                   1                   2                   3

  The extension is based on a related LDP extension, defined in [DIFF-
  MPLS], for support of Diff-Serv TLV but further extended for CR-LDP 
  with CR-LDP TLVs. 
   
2.      Class Type TLV 
   
  The Class Type TLV has the following form: 
     0                   1                   2                   3

  Reserved : 29 bits 
       This field is reserved. It must be set to zero on transmission 
       and must be ignored on receipt.  
   
  CT : 3 bits 
       Indicates the Class-Type. Values currently allowed are 1, 2, ... 
       , 7. 
   
3.      Handling Class Type TLV 
   
  To establish an LSP using CR-LDP, an ingress LSR generates a Label       
  Request message as per [CR-LDP]. This Label Request may optionally 
  include the Diff-Serv TLV as defined in [DIFF-MPLS] for LDP but 
  extended to CR-LDP. 
   
  If the LSP is associated with Class-Type 0, the ingress LSR MUST NOT 
  include the Class Type TLV in the Label Request message. 
   
  If the LSP is associated with Class-Type N (1 <= N <= 7), the ingress 
  LSR MUST include the Class Type TLV in the Label Request message with 
  the Class-Type (CT) field set to N. 
   
  If a Label Request message contains multiple Class Type TLVs, only 
  the first one is meaningful; subsequent Class Type TLV(s) MUST be 
  ignored and not forwarded. 
   
  If the Class Type TLV is not present in the Label Request message, an 
  LSR MUST associate the Class-Type 0 to the LSP. 
   
  A downstream LSR sending a Label Mapping message in response to a 
  Label Request message MUST NOT include the Class-Type TLV (whether 
  the Class-Type TLV was included in the Label Request message or not). 
   
  During establishment of an LSP corresponding to the Class-Type N, an 
  LSR MUST perform admission control over the bandwidth available for 
  that particular Class-Type. 
         
  An LSR that recognizes the Class Type TLV and receives a Label 
  Request message which contains the Class Type TLV but which does not 
  contain any of the CR-LDP TLVs, MUST reject the label request by 
  sending upstream a Notification message which includes the Status TLV 
  with a Status Code of 'Unexpected Class-Type TLV'. This is defined 
  below in section 4. This error can only occur when an LDP LSP as 
  opposed to CR-LDP LSP is being established. As was already mentioned, 
  Class Type TLV extension for Diff-Serv-aware Traffic Engineering is 
  not applicable to LDP. 
             
  An LSR receiving a Label Request message with the Class Type TLV, 
  which recognizes the Class Type TLV but does not support the 
  particular Class-Type, MUST reject the label request by sending 
  upstream a Notification message which includes the Status TLV with a

  Status Code of 'Unsupported Class-Type'. This is defined below in 
  section 4. 
   
  An LSR receiving a Label Request message with the Class Type TLV, 
  which recognizes the Class Type TLV but determines that the Class-
  Type value is not valid (i.e. Class-Type value 0), MUST reject the 
  label request by sending upstream a Notification message which 
  includes the Status TLV with a Status Code of 'Invalid Class-Type 
  value'. This is defined below in section 4. 
   
  An LSR receiving a Label Request message with the Class Type TLV, 
  which: 
        - recognizes the Class Type TLV,  
        - supports the particular Class-Type, but  
        - determines that the tuple formed by (i) this Class-Type and 
          (ii) the set-up priority signaled in the same Label Request 
          message,  is not one of the eight TE-classes configured in 
          the TE-class mapping, 
  MUST reject the label request by sending upstream a Notification 
  message which includes the Status TLV with a Status Code of 'CT and 
  setup priority do not form a configured TE-Class'. This is defined 
  below in section 4. 
   
  An LSR receiving a Label Request message with the Class Type TLV, 
  which:

        - determines that the tuple formed by (i) this Class-Type and 
          (ii) the holding priority signaled in the same Label Request 
          message,  is not one of the eight TE-classes configured in 
          the TE-class mapping, 
  MUST reject the label request by sending upstream a Notification 
  message which includes the Status TLV with a Status Code of 'CT and 
  holding priority do not form a configured TE-Class'. This is defined 
  below in section 4. 
 
  An LSR receiving a Label Request message with the Class Type TLV and 
  with the Diff-Serv TLV for an L-LSP, which: 
        - recognizes the Class Type TLV,  
        - has local knowledge of the relationship between Class-Types 
          and PSC (e.g. via configuration) 
        - based on this local knowledge, determines that the PSC 
          signaled in the Diff-Serv TLV is inconsistent with the Class-
          Type signaled in the Class-Type TLV, 
  MUST reject the label request by sending upstream a Notification 
  message which includes the Status TLV with a Status Code of 
  'Inconsistency between signaled PSC and signaled CT'. This is defined 
  below in section 4.

          signaled in the MAP entries of the Diff-Serv TLV are 
          inconsistent with the Class-Type signaled in the Class-Type 
          TLV, 
  MUST reject the label request by sending upstream a Notification 
  message which includes the Status TLV with a Status Code of 
  'Inconsistency between signaled PHBs and signaled CT'. This is 
  defined below in section 4. 
 
  An LSR MUST handle the situations where the LSP can not be accepted 
  for other reasons than those already discussed in this section, in 
  accordance with [CR-LDP], [LDP] and [DIFF-MPLS] (e.g. reservation 
  rejected by admission control, a label can not be associated).

Appendix C - Example Formulas for Computing "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" 
   
1.      Example Formulas Without Local Overbooking 
   
  Keeping in mind that details of admission control algorithms as well 
  as formulas for computing "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" are outside the 
  scope of this specification, we provide in this section, for 
  illustration purposes, an example of how values for the unreserved 
  bandwidth for TE-Class[i] might be computed, assuming: 
        - the Russian Doll Bandwidth Constraints Model is used 
        - the basic admission control algorithm which simply deducts 
          the exact bandwidth of any established LSP from all of the 
          Bandwidth Constraints relevant to the CT associated with that 
          LSP.

        - the optional per-CT Local Overbooking Multipliers are not 
          used (.i.e. LOM[c]=1, 0<= c <=7). 
   
  We assume that: 
       TE-Class [i] <--> < CTc , preemption p> 
  in the configured TE-Class mapping. 
   
  Let us define "Reserved(CTb,q)" as the sum of the bandwidth reserved 
  by all established LSPs which belong to CTb and have a holding 
  priority of q. Note that if q and CTb do not form one of the 8 
  possible configured TE-Classes, then there can not be any established 
  LSP which belong to CTb and have a holding priority of q, so in that 
  case Reserved(CTb,q)=0. 
   
  For readability, formulas are first shown assuming only 4 CTs are 
  active. The formulas below can be extended trivially to cover the 
  cases where more CTs are used. 
   
  If CTc = CT0, then "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" = 
       [ BC0 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 0 <= b <= 3 
   
   
  If CTc = CT1, then "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" = 
       MIN  [ 
       [ BC1 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 1 <= b <= 3, 
       [ BC0 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 0 <= b <= 3 
            ] 
   
   
  If CTc = CT2, then "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" = 
       MIN  [ 
       [ BC2 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 2 <= b <= 3, 
       [ BC1 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 1 <= b <= 3, 
       [ BC0 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 0 <= b <= 3 
            ] 
   
   
  If CTc = CT3, then "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" = 
       MIN  [ 
       [ BC3 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 3 <= b <= 3, 
       [ BC2 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 2 <= b <= 3, 
       [ BC1 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 1 <= b <= 3, 
       [ BC0 - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 0 <= b <= 3 
            ] 
   
   
  The formula can be generalized to 8 active CTs and expressed in a 
  more compact way in the following: 
   
        "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" = 
       MIN  [ 
       [ BCc - SUM ( Reserved(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and c <= b <= 7,

  where: 
       TE-Class [i] <--> < CTc , preemption p> 
  in the configured TE-Class mapping. 
   
2.      Example Formulas With Local Overbooking 
   
  When the optional local overbooking method is supported, the above 
  example generalized formula becomes:  
   
        "Unreserved TE-Class [i]" = 
       LOM(c) x MIN  [ 
       [ BCc - SUM ( Normalised(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and c <= b <= 7, 
       . . . 
       [ BC0 - SUM ( Normalised(CTb,q) ) ] for q <= p and 0 <= b <= 7, 
            ] 
   
  where: 
        - TE-Class [i] <--> < CTc , preemption p>  
          in the configured TE-Class mapping. 
        - Normalised(CTb,q) = Reserved(CTb/q)/LOM(b) 
   
   
Appendix D - Prediction for Multiple Path Computation 
 
  There are situations where a Head-End needs to compute paths for 
  multiple LSPs. There are potential advantages for the Head-end in 
  trying to predict the impact of the n-th LSP on the unreserved 
  bandwidth when computing the path for the (n+1)-th LSP, before 
  receiving updated IGP information. One example would be to perform 
  better load-distribution of the multiple LSPs across multiple paths. 
  Another example would be to avoid CAC rejection when the (n+1)-th LSP 
  would no longer fit on a link after establishment of the n-th LSP. 
  While there are also a number of conceivable scenarios where doing 
  such predictions might result in a worse situation, it is more likely 
  to improve the situation. As a matter of fact, a number of network 
  administrators have elected to use such predictions when deploying 
  existing TE. 
   
  Such predictions are local matters, are optional and are outside the 
  scope of this specification. 
   
  Where such predictions are not used, the optional Bandwidth 
  Constraint sub-TLV and the optional Local Overbooking Multiplier sub-
  TLV need not be advertised in IGP since the information contained in 
  the Unreserved Bw sub-TLV is all that is required by Head-Ends to 
  perform Constraint Based Routing.

                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
  Where such predictions are used on Head-Ends, the optional Bandwidth 
  Constraint sub-TLV (and the optional Local Overbooking Multiplier 
  sub-TLV if different overbooking ratios need to be supported on 
  different links) MAY be advertised in IGP. This is in order for the 
  Head-ends to predict as accurately as possible how an LSP affects 
  unreserved bandwidth values for subsequent LSPs.  
   
  Remembering that actual admission control algorithms are left for 
  vendor differentiation, we observe that predictions can only be 
  performed effectively when the Head-end LSR predictions are based on 
  the same (or a very close) admission control algorithm as used by 
  other LSRs.  
     
   
Appendix E - Addressing [DSTE-REQ] Scenarios 
   
  This Appendix provides examples of how the DS-TE solution can be used 
  to support each of the scenario described in [DSTE-REQ]. 
   
1.      Scenario 1: Limiting Amount of Voice 
   
  By configuring on every link:  
        - Bandwidth Constraint 1 (for CT1=Voice) = "certain percentage" 
          of link capacity 
        - BC0= Max Reservable Link Bandwidth =  link capacity 
   
  By configuring: 
        - every CT1/Voice TE-LSP with preemption =0  
        - every CT0/Data TE-LSP with preemption =1 
   
  The proposed solution will address all the requirements: 
        - amount of Voice traffic limited to desired percentage on 
          every link 
        - data traffic capable of using all remaining link capacity 
        - voice traffic capable of preempting other traffic 
   
2.      Scenario 2: Maintain Relative Proportion of Traffic Classes 
   
  By configuring on every link:  
        - BC2 for CT2 = e.g. 45% 
        - BC1 for CT1+CT2 = e.g. 80% 
        - BC0 for CT0+CT1+CT2= e.g.100% 
   
  The proposed DS-TE solution will ensure that the amount of traffic of 
  each Class Type established on a link is within acceptable levels as 
  compared to the resources allocated to the corresponding Diff-Serv 
  PHBs regardless of which order the LSPs are routed in, regardless of 
  which preemption priorities are used by which LSPs and regardless of 
  failure situations. Optional automatic adjustment of Diff-Sev 
  scheduling configuration could be used for maintaining very strict 
  relationship between amount of established traffic of each Class Type 
  and corresponding Diff-Serv resources.

                   Protocols for Diff-Serv-aware TE          June 2002 
 
   
3.      Scenario 3: Guaranteed Bandwidth Services 
   
  By configuring on every link:  
        - BC1 for CT1 = "given" percentage of bandwidth (appropriate to 
          achieve the Guaranteed Bandwidth service's QoS objectives) 
        - BC0 for CT0+CT1 = 100% 
   
  The proposed DS-TE solution will ensure that the amount of Guaranteed 
  Bandwidth Trafic established on every link remains below the given 
  percentage so that it will always meet its QoS objectives. AT the 
  same time it will allow traffic engineering of the rest of the 
  traffic such that links can be filled up. 
   
   
Appendix F - Solution Evaluation 
   
1.      Satisfying Detailed Requirements 
   
  This DS-TE Solution address all the scenarios presented in [DSTE-REQ] 
  as explained in Appendix E. It also satisfy all the detailed 
  requirements presented in [DSTE-REQ]. 
   
2.      Flexibility 
   
  This DS-TE solution supports 8 CTs. It is entirely flexible as to how 
  Traffic Trunks are grouped together into a CT. 
   
3.      Extendibility 
   
  A maximum of 8 CTs is considered by the authors of this document as 
  more than comfortable. However, this solution could be extended to 
  support more CTs if deemed necessary in the future. However, this 
  would necessitate additional IGP extensions beyond those specified in 
  this document. 
   
4.      Scalability 
   
  This DS-TE solution is expected to have a very small scalability 
  impact compared to existing TE. 
   
  From an IGP viewpoint, the amount of mandatory information to be 
  advertised is identical to existing TE. Two additional sub-TLVs have 
  been specified, but their use is optional and those contained a 
  limited amount of static information (at most 8 Bandwidth Constraints 
  and 8 LOMs). 
   
  We expect no noticeable impact on LSP Path computation since, as with 
  existing TE, this solution only require CSPF to consider a single 
  unreserved bandwidth value for any given LSP.

  From a signaling viewpoint we expect no significant impact due to 
  this solution since it only requires processing of one additional 
  information (the Class-Type) and does not significantly increase the 
  likelihood of CAC rejection. Note that DS-TE has some inherent impact 
  on LSP signaling in the sense that it assumes that different classes 
  of traffic are split over different LSPs so that more LSPs need to be 
  signaled; but this is due to the DS-TE concept itself and not to the 
  actual DS-TE solution discussed here. 
   
5.      Backward Compatibility/Migration 
   
  This solution is expected to allow smooth migration from existing TE 
  to DS-TE. This is because existing TE can be supported exactly as 
  today as a particular configuration of DS-TE. This means that an 
  "upgraded" LSR with a DS-TE implementation can directly interwork 
  with an "old" LSR supporting existing TE only. 
   
  This solution is expected to allow smooth migration when increasing 
  the number of CTs actually deployed since it only requires 
  configuration changes. however, these changes must be performed in a 
  coordinated manner across the DS-TE domain. 
   
   
Appendix G - Interoperability with non DS-TE capable LSRs 
   
  This DSTE solution allows operations in a hybrid network where some 
  LSRs are DS-TE capable while some LSRs and not DS-TE capable, which 
  may occur during migration phases. This Appendix discusses the 
  constraints and operations in such hybrid networks. 
   
  We refer to the set of DS-TE capable LSRs as the DS-TE domain. We 
  refer to the set of non DS-TE capable (but TE capable) LSRs as the 
  TE-domain. 
   
  Hybrid operations requires that the TE-class mapping in the DS-TE 
  domain is configured so that: 
        - a TE-class exist for CT0 for every preemption priority 
          actually used in the TE domain 
        - the index in the TE-class mapping for each of these TE-
          classes is equal to the preemption priority. 
   
  For example, imagine the TE domain uses preemption 2 and 3. Then, DS-
  TE can be deployed in the same network by including the following TE-
  classes in the TE-class mapping: 
          i   <--->       CT      preemption 
        ==================================== 
          2               CT0     2 
          3               CT0     3 
   
  Another way to look at this is to say that, the whole TE-class 
  mapping does not have to be consistent with the TE domain, but the

  subset of this TE-Class mapping applicable to CT0 must effectively be 
  consistent with the TE domain. 
   
  In such hybrid networks : 
        - CT0 LSPs can be established by both DS-TE capable LSRs and 
          non-DSTE capable LSRs  
        - CT0 LSPs can transit via (or terminate at) both DS-TE capable 
          LSRs and non-DSTE capable LSRs  
        - LSPs from other CTs can only be established by DS-TE capable 
          LSRs 
        - LSPs from other CTs can only transit via (or terminate at)  
          DS-TE capable LSRs 
   
  Note that, for such hybrid operation, non DS-TE capable LSRs need to 
  be able to accept Unreserved Bw sub-TLVs containing non decreasing 
  bandwidth values (ie with Unreserved [p] < Unreserved [q] with p <q). 
  Also, the Bandwidth Constraints sub-TLV needs to be advertised in the 
  DS-TE domain and the Maximum Reservable Bandwidth sub-TLV needs to be 
  advertised in the TE-domain and the DS-TE domain.  
   
  Let us consider, the following example to illustrate operations: 
   
  LSR0--------LSR1----------LSR2 
       Link01       Link12 
   
  Where: 
       LSR0 is a non-DS-TE capable LSR 
       LSR1 and LSR2 are DS-TE capable LSRs 
   
  Let's assume again that preemption 2 and 3 are used in the TE-domain 
  and that the following TE-class mapping is configured on LSR1 and 
  LSR2: 
          i   <--->       CT      preemption 
        ==================================== 
          0               CT1     0 
          1               CT1     1 
          2               CT0     2 
          3               CT0     3 
       rest                 unused 
   
  LSR0 is configured with a Max Reservable bandwidth=m for Link01. 
  LSR1 is configured with a BC0=x0 and a BC1=x1(possibly=0) for Link01. 
   
  LSR0 will advertise in IGP for Link01: 
        - Max Reservable Bw sub-TLV = <m> 
        - Unreserved Bw sub-TLV = 
          <CT0/0,CT0/1,CT0/2,CT0/3,CT0/4,CT0/5,CT0/6,CT0/7> 
   
  On receipt of such advertisement, LSR1 will: 
        - understand that LSR0 is not DS-TE capable because it 
          advertised a Max Reservable Bw sub-TLV and no Bandwidth 
          Constraint sub-TLV

        - conclude that only CT0 LSPs can transit via LSR0 and that 
          only the values CT0/2 and CT0/3 are meaningful in the 
          Unreserved Bw sub-TLV. LSR1 may effectively behave as if the 
          six other values contained in the Unreserved Bw sub-TLV were 
          set to zero.  
   
  LSR1 will advertise in IGP for Link01: 
        - Max Reservable Bw sub-TLV = <x0> 
        - Bandwidth Constraint sub-TLV = <BC Model ID=0, x0,x1> 
        - Unreserved Bw sub-TLV = <CT1/0,CT1/1,CT0/2,CT0/3,0,0,0,0> 
   
  On receipt of such advertisement, LSR0 will: 
        - Ignore the Bandwidth Constraint sub-TLV (unrecognized) 
        - Correctly process CT0/2 and CT0/3 in the Unreserved Bw sub-
          TLV and use these values for CTO LSP establishment 
        - Incorrectly believe that the other values contained in the 
          Unreserved Bw sub-TLV relates to other preemption priorities 
          for CT0, but will actually never use those since we assume 
          that only preemption 2 and 3 are used in the TE domain.
