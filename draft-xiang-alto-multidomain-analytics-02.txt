 Unicorn: Resource Orchestration for Multi-Domain, Geo-Distributed Data
                               Analytics
             draft-xiang-alto-multidomain-analytics-02.txt

Abstract

   As the data volume increases exponentially over time, data analytics
   is transiting from a single-domain network to a multi-domain, geo-
   distributed network, where different member networks contribute
   various resources, e.g., computation, storage and networking
   resources, to collaboratively collect, share and analyze extremely
   large amounts of data.  Such a network calls for a resource
   orchestration framework that emphasizes the performance
   predictability of data analytics jobs, the high utilization of
   resources, and the autonomy and privacy of member networks.

   This document presents the design of Unicorn, a unified resource
   orchestration framework for multi-domain, geo-distributed data
   analytics, which uses the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
   (ALTO) protocol as the key component for (1) allows member networks
   to provide accurate information on different types of resources; (2)
   keeps the private information of member networks; and (3) allows data
   analytics jobs to accurately describe their requirements of different
   types of resources.  As a part of Unicorn, an ALTO extension for
   privacy-preserving interdomain information aggregation is also
   presented.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the design of Unicorn, a unified resource
   orchestration framework for large-scale data analytics in multi-
   domain, geo-distributed networks.  An important use case for such
   settings is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) network, which consists
   of over 180 member networks all over the world, to support scientists
   to access multiple resources, e.g., computing, storage and networking
   resources, distributed in the member networks to conduct large-scale
   data analytics.  With more and more data being generated and stored
   in different geo-distributed member networks, network architects and
   administrators are exploring different designs for efficient resource
   orchestration in multi-domain, geo-distributed networks.

   The design presented in this document is based on the development and
   deployment experience of Unicorn in the CMS network, one of the
   largest scientific experiments in the LHC network.  The primary
   requirements of resource orchestration in such a multi-domain, geo-
   distributed environment are the performance predictability of various
   data analytics jobs, the high utilization of different types of
   resources, and the autonomy and privacy of resource owners, i.e.,
   member networks.

   Pre-production development and extensive testing have shown that the
   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization Protocol [RFC7285] is well
   suited as a fundamental component in Unicorn for providing a generic
   representation that (1) allows different types of data analytics jobs
   to accurately describe their resource requirements and (2) allows
   member networks to provide accurate information on different types of
   resources they own and at the same time maintain their privacies.
   This is in contrast with the state-of-the-art resource orchestration
   frameworks, such as HTCondor and Mesos, which either do not provide
   accurate networking information or expose all the private details of
   member networks.  This document elaborates on the design requirements
   of resource orchestration in multi-domain, geo-distributed networks

   that lead to this design choice and presents the details of Unicorn,
   including an ALTO extension for privacy-preserving, interdomain
   information aggregation.

   This document first gives an overview of the characteristics of
   multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics.  Then, the design
   requirements for resource orchestration under such settings are
   summarized.  After reviewing existing designs and their limitations,
   this document gives the arguments for using ALTO as the generic
   representation for describing both resource requirements and the
   resource information and describes the design details of Unicorn.
   Finally, a privacy-preserving, interdomain extension of ALTO is
   presented.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Changes Since Version -01

   o  Update the design of Unicorn system by introducing a proactive
      full-mesh resource discovery mechanism.

   o  Update the design of the privacy-preserving interdomain resource
      information aggregation protocol.

4.  Characteristics of Multi-Domain, Geo-Distributed Data Analytics

   This section describes the characteristics of multi-domain, geo-
   distributed data analytics.

4.1.  Dynamic Data Analytics Workload

   In multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics, extremely large
   amounts of data are generated and stored across different member
   networks.  Authorized users from different organizations can access
   data and resources in member networks to conduct various data
   analytics jobs using various data analytics applications.

   An data analytics application usually provides an automated process
   that decomposes a large data analytics job into a set of smaller
   tasks, whose dependencies are expressed as a directed acyclic graph
   (DAG).  Tasks without any dependency can be executed in parallel to
   improve the efficiency of the data analytics job they belong to.
   This decomposition is highly user- and application-dependent.




Xiang, et al.            Expires January 3, 2019                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               Unicorn Design                    July 2018


   Each task may have different requirements on different resources.
   For instance, task T1 may require dataset A in storage node X as
   input and 1 CPU as the computing resource, while task T2 may require
   dataset B in storage node Y as input and 2 CPUs as the computing
   resource.  Furthermore, each task may require resources from
   different member networks.  In the previous example, T1 may require
   its output to be stored in a storage node in another member network
   for the purpose of secure storage.  The resource requirements of
   tasks are highly user- and application-dependent.

   From the above description, it is observed that the workload of
   multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics is highly dynamic, in
   terms of the number of users, the types of applications, the number
   of jobs, the decomposition of jobs and the resource requirements of
   tasks.

   Though with such dynamism, it is the general consensus of users to
   expect performance predictability of their analytics jobs (TODO: add
   Mogul citation).  Hence the resource orchestration for multi-domain,
   geo-distributed data analytics must be able to achieve efficient
   resource sharing among different data analytics jobs of different
   applications from different users.  To this end, a generic
   representation of resource requirements for different tasks from
   different analytics applications must be chosen.  Furthermore, to
   ensure maximal deployment, the resource orchestration framework must
   be independent of and compatible with data analytics applications.

4.2.  Dynamic Resource Availability

   In the multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics network,
   different member networks belong to different administrative domains.
   Each member network has its own resource management policies and can
   choose to use different management software, such as HTCondor and
   Mesos.

   Each member network provides different types of resources with
   different amounts.  For example, transit networks such as ESNet and
   Internet2 provide high-bandwidth networking resources.  In contrast,
   campus science networks provide abundant computation and storage
   resources, but may provide limited networking bandwidths.  And some
   smaller science networks only provide limited computation and storage
   resources.  The availability of the resources in each member network
   is subject to the autonomous control of the member network.

   Furthermore, member networks are interconnected with high bandwidth-
   delay-product links, where state-of-the-art networking resource
   allocation mechanisms, such as TCP, become inefficient [XCP].

   From the above description, it is observed that the resource
   availability of the multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics
   network is also highly dynamic, subject to the types of member
   networks, the resources provided by member networks and the resource
   management policies and management software used by member networks.

   Though with such dynamism, it is the general consensus of member
   networks that the resource orchestration for multi-domain, geo-
   distributed data analytics must achieve high utilization of different
   types of resources, following the autonomy and privacy of each member
   network.  To this end, a generic representation of resource
   availabilities for different types of resources must be chosen.  Such
   a representation must be accurate and at the same time maintain the
   privacy of member networks.  Furthermore, to ensure maximal
   deployment, the resource orchestration framework must be independent
   of and compatible with the resource management systems used by member
   networks.

5.  Design Requirements

   This section summarizes the design requirements for resource
   orchestration for multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics from
   the previous section.

   o  REQ1: Provide performance predictability for data analytics jobs.

   o  REQ2: Achieve the efficient resource sharing among data analytics
      jobs.

   o  REQ3: Achieve the high utilization of different types of resources
      in member networks.

   o  REQ4: Maintain the autonomy and privacy of member networks.

   o  REQ5: Provide compatibility with different data analytics
      applications and resource management systems to maximize the
      deployment.

6.  Review of Resource Orchestration Designs for Data Analytics

   This section provides an overview of three general types of resource
   orchestration designs for data analytics -- the centralized resource-
   graph-based orchestration, the centralized ClassAds-based
   orchestration and the distributed opportunistic orchestration.  Then,
   the key reason why these designs are inadequate for multi-domain,
   geo-distributed data analytics is provided.

Internet-Draft               Unicorn Design                    July 2018


6.1.  Centralized resource-graph-based orchestration

   Systems such as Mesos [Mesos] and Borg [Borg] adopt a graph-based
   abstraction to represent the resource availability of computing
   clusters.  Each node in the graph is a physical node representing
   computation or storage resources and each edge between a pair of
   nodes denotes the networking resource connecting two physical nodes.
   This design is inadequate for multi-domain, geo-distributed data
   analytics system because (1) it compromises the privacy of different
   member networks by revealing all the details of resources; and (2)
   the overhead to keep the resource availability graph up to date is
   too expensive due to the heterogeneity and dynamicity of resources
   from different member networks.

6.2.  Centralized ClassAds-based orchestration

   HTCondor [HTCondor] proposes a ClassAds programming model, which
   allows different resource owners to advertise their resource supply
   and the job owners to advertise the resource demand.  However, this
   programming model does not support the accurate discovery of
   networking resources, but leave the orchestration of networking
   resources completely to TCP, which has been known to behave poorly in
   networks with high bandwidth-delay products [XCP].

6.3.  Distributed opportunistic orchestration

   Some systems, such as Apollo [Apollo] and Sparrow [Sparrow], use a
   distributed design.  In this design, given a data analytics job, a
   small number of computing and storage nodes are randomly selected as
   candidates.  Then a scheduling algorithm makes the decision to select
   the best pair of computing and storage nodes within this small set of
   candidates.  Though it is shown in production that this design
   achieves a performance very close to the theoretical optimal resource
   allocation scheme, this design cannot be applied to multi-domain,
   geo-distributed data analytics because (1) the pool of computing and
   storage resources is much larger, and is distributed across the
   world, and (2) it is hard to distributively orchestrate networking
   resources in such a high bandwidth-delay product scenario.

6.4.  Inadequacy of Existing Designs for Multi-Domain, Geo-Distributed
      Data Analytics

   Applying the designs reviewed in the preceding subsections for multi-
   domain, geo-distributed data analytics only satisfies the design
   requirement of compatibility (REQ5), but leaves all the other
   requirements unfulfilled.  The key reason is that they do not have an
   information model that simultaneously

   o  allows member networks to provide accurate information on
      different types of resources, e.g., the computing, storage and
      networking resources, they own;

   o  keeps the private information of member networks, such as physical
      topologies and policies, from the data analytics applications; and

   o  allows data analytics jobs to accurately describe their
      requirements of different types of resources.

7.  Unicorn Design

   This section presents the design of the Unicorn framework.  First,
   the motivations of using ALTO as the information model of resource
   orchestration for multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics are
   reviewed.  Then the architecture of Unicorn is provided.

7.1.  Choosing ALTO as the Resource Information Model

   As reviewed in the preceding section, the commonly used resource-
   graph-based information model and the ClassAds information model do
   not support the accurate, yet privacy-preserving resource discovery
   across different member networks.  In contrast, the ALTO protocol
   uses abstract maps of networks to provide network information with
   the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while
   maintaining or improving application performance [RFC7285].  This
   document proposes the use of ALTO for providing information of
   different types of resources, e.g., computing, storage and networking
   resources.  This design has the following advantages:

   o  ALTO provides the network information based on abstract maps of a
      network.  Additional services are built on top of the ALTO
      abstract maps to provide information of other types of resources,
      e.g., the computing and storage resources.  These maps provide
      accurate information of different types of resources for the
      resource orchestration system to effectively utilize them for data
      analytics applications.  For example, the ALTO Endpoint Property
      Service can provide information of computing nodes and storage
      nodes.

   o  The ALTO abstract maps provide a simplified view of resources of
      member networks, instead of the full details of their resource
      availability.  Thus ALTO allows member networks to keep their
      private information, such as physical topologies and policies,
      from the applications.  For example, the ALTO Network Map service
      provides a "one-big-switch" view that defines a grouping of
      network endpoints.  This view hides the details of the underlying

      physical topology of the network and a network deploying the ALTO
      server has the autonomy to adopt any endpoint grouping algorithm.

   o  ALTO uses a client-server model, in which applications can use
      ALTO clients to accurately describe their requirements of
      different types of resources and send these requirements to the
      ALTO servers to retrieve the accurate information of resources
      that suit their requirements.  For example, the ALTO Multi-Cost
      service [RFC8189] allows an ALTO client to specify a logic set of
      tests in a query.  Such tests are used by ALTO servers to filter
      out the information of unqualified resources from the response
      sent back to the ALTO client.

7.2.  Architecture of Unicorn

   This section describes the design details of Unicorn.  Figure 1
   presents the architecture of Unicorn for a multi-domain, geo-
   distributed data analytics system with N member networks.  In

   o  ALTO Server: for each member network, one or more ALTO servers are
      deployed to provide accurate, yet privacy-preserving information
      of different types of resources owned by the corresponding
      network.  Examples of such information include the link bandwidth
      between endpoints, the memory I/O bandwidth and the CPU
      utilization at computing endpoints and the storage space at
      storage endpoints.  In addition to the basic ALTO services defined
      in [RFC7285], The ALTO servers in Unicorn also provide ALTO
      extension services such as the ALTO Multi-Cost Service [RFC8189],
      the ALTO Server-Sent Event Service [DRAFT-SSE] and the ALTO
      Multipart Cost Property Service [DRAFT-PV] to provide fine-grained
      resource information.

   o  Distributed Hash Table (DHT) of Computing and Storage Resources: A
      DHT system is deployed across member networks to lookup the
      location of computing and storage resources.  Compared with the
      current centralized lookup services in the CMS network, i.e.,
      PhEDEx and HTCondor, a DHT system provides a significant
      performance improvement for discovering the locations of computing
      and storage resources in multi-domain, geo-distributed data
      analytics systems.

   o  Resource Orchestrator: The orchestrator is a shim layer between
      the data analytics jobs from different applications and the member
      networks.  It contains an ALTO client that communicates with the
      ALTO servers at member networks to retrieve resource information.
      Given a set of data analytics jobs, the orchestrator adopts a
      three-phase discovery process, which will be elaborated in the
      next section, to find the accurate information of all the
      resources that can be used to execute these jobs.  Then the
      orchestrator runs a customized resource allocation algorithm to
      compute the resource allocation decisions for these jobs, and send
      the decisions to the execution agents at corresponding member
      networks.

   o  Execution Agent: One or more execution agents are deployed at each
      member network.  They take the resource allocation decisions from
      the resource orchestrator, and communicate with the underlying
      resource management system deployed at the corresponding member
      network to reserve the resources for the data analytics jobs and
      execute them.

7.2.1.  Three-Phase Resource Discovery

   The preceding subsection describes the architecture and the key
   components of Unicorn.  One missing component is how to accurately
   discover the information of different types of resources for a set of

   data analytics jobs with the assistance of ALTO.  This section
   presents the three-phase resource discovery design in Unicorn.

7.2.1.1.  Phase 1: Endpoint Property Discovery

   Figure 2 shows the procedure of the endpoint property discovery
   phase.  Given a set of data analytics jobs, the resource orchestrator
   communicates with the DHT lookup system to find the locations, i.e.,
   the endpoint addresses, of all candidate computing and storage
   resources.  With such information, the ALTO client then issues
   Endpoint Property Service (EPS) queries to the ALTO servers deployed
   at member networks to discover the information of all candidate
   endpoints.

             Figure 2: The Endpoint Property Discovery Phase.

7.2.1.2.  Phase 2: Endpoint Path Discovery

   Candidate computing and storage endpoints need to move data between
   them before, during and after the execution of a data analytics job.
   In multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics, a pair of candidate
   endpoints may not be in the same member network.  In this case, the
   orchestrator needs to find out the connectivity information between
   such a pair of candidate endpoints.

   Figure 3 shows the procedure of the endpoint path discovery phase.
   Given a pair of candidate endpoints that are not in the same member
   network, the ALTO client in the orchestrator adopts an iterative
   process to find the interdomain connectivity information for this
   pair.  It starts by issuing an ALTO Endpoint Cost Service query or an
   ALTO Flow-based Endpoint Cost Service [DRAFT-FCS] to the ALTO server
   of the member network where the source endpoint locates.  The cost

   type of this query is a customized type called next-hop, with a
   customized cost mode tuple and a customized cost metric next-network.

               Figure 3: The Endpoint Path Discovery Phase.

   The ALTO server returns a 2-tuple, where the first element is the
   autonomous number (AS) of the next member network along the AS-path
   from the source endpoint to the destination endpoint, and the second
   element is the ingress of this next member network.  In a member
   network, the ALTO server can get such information from the underlying
   interdomain routing protocol, e.g., BGP.  Based on the received
   response, the ALTO client then issues a similar query to the ALTO
   server of the next member network.  The process stops when the ALTO
   server of the member network where the destination endpoint locates
   receives such a query, who will return a null 2-tuple in response to
   notify the ALTO client.  By the end of this process, the ALTO client
   can assemble a domain-path, in the form of a path vector of (ingress,
   AS), of this pair of candidate endpoints.

7.2.1.3.  Phase 3: Resource State Abstraction Discovery

   After the second phase, the resource orchestrator has the
   connectivity information of each candidate endpoint pair, i.e., the
   domain-path.  Equivalently, for each member network, it knows the set
   of all candidate endpoint pairs that will enter this network.  With
   this information, the resource orchestrator can communicate with the
   ALTO servers at member networks to discover the resource sharing
   between all the candidate endpoint pairs.  In particular, Unicorn
   extends the routing state abstraction [DRAFT-RSA] to the more generic
   resource state abstraction to represent such resource sharing.

   Figure 4 shows the procedure of the resource state abstraction
   discovery phase.  For each member network, the ALTO client in the
   orchestrator sends an ALTO Multipart Cost Property Service query
   defined in [DRAFT-PV] by providing the set of candidate endpoint
   pairs as input.  The cost type of this query is path vector.  Upon
   receiving the query, the ALTO server in each member network computes
   an ALTO cost map and an ATLO property map to the ALTO client.  These
   two maps represent a set of linear inequalities revealing the
   resource sharing among the set of candidate endpoint pairs in the
   member network.

         Figure 4: The Resource State Abstraction Discovery Phase.

   Unicorn provides two mechanisms for the ALTO servers to return the
   computed cost maps and property maps to the ALTO client.  The first
   mechanism is to let each ALTO server independently sends its response
   to the ALTO client.  The second mechanism is a privacy-preserving
   interdomain information aggregation process, in which the ALTO
   servers in all member networks use a secure multi-party computation
   (SMPC) protocol to collectively send the responses to the ALTO client
   without revealing the source of any entry, i.e., the linear in
   equality, in the cost maps and property maps.

   The first mechanism has a higher security risk in that it exposes the
   bottleneck resource information of each member network.  In contrast,
   the second mechanism provides a better protection of the private
   information of each member network.  The details of the privacy-
   preserving interdomain information aggregation process will be
   presented in the next section.

   After receiving the responses sent back from the ALTO servers from
   all the member networks, the orchestrator finishes the whole resource

   discovery process and collects the accurate information of different
   types of resources for data analytics jobs.

7.2.2.  Proactive Full-Mesh Resource Discovery

   To ensure the resource discovery process scales, a proactive full-
   mesh resource discovery component is developed.  The main idea of
   this component consists in having the ALTO client periodically query
   ALTO servers at all sites to discover the resource state abstraction
   between every pair of source and destination sites.  As such, when an
   application submits a resource discovery request, the ALTO client
   does not need to send any query to the ALTO servers.  Instead, using
   the site-level bandwidth sharing information, the ALTO client can
   immediately perform projection operations to get the resource
   information for the request.  This mechanism substantially improves
   the scalability of Unicorn.

7.3.  Example

   This subsection gives an example to illustrate the workflow of
   Unicorn.  Figure 5 gives a topology of three member networks, where
   s1 and s2 are storage endpoints and d1 and d2 are computation
   endpoints.  Assume a data analytics job is composed of two parallel
   tasks T1 and T2.  T1 needs dataset X as input and T2 needs dataset Y
   as input.

                                     .------------.
                                     | Network B  |
               .------------.    ingB|            |
               | Network A  |--------|     d1     |
               |            |        '------------'
               |    s1      |
               |            |        .------------.
               |    s2      |--------| Network C  |
               '------------'    ingC|            |
                                     |     d2     |
                                     '------------'


              Figure 5: An Illustrating Example for Unicorn.

   In the endpoint property discovery phase, the Unicorn resource
   orchestrator finds that s1 stores X and s2 stores Y, and that the
   locations of s1, s2, d1 and d2, from the DHT lookup system.  It then
   issues EPS queries to network A, B and C, respectively, to discover
   that d1 satisfies the computing requirements of T1 and d2 satisfies
   the computing requirements of T2.  Hence there are only two candidate
   endpoint pairs: (s1, d1) and (s2, d2).



Xiang, et al.            Expires January 3, 2019               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft               Unicorn Design                    July 2018


   In the endpoint path discovery phase, the ALTO client in the
   orchestrator iteratively issues Endpoint Cost Service (ECS) query to
   the ALTO servers in member networks, and finds that the domain-path
   for pair (s1, d2) is [(null, A), (ingB, B)] and the domain-path for
   pair (s2, d2) is [(null, A), (ingB, B)].  Hence both pairs will use
   the networking resources of network A, while only (s1, d1) will use
   network B and only (s2, d2) will use network C.

   In the resource state abstraction discovery phase, the ALTO client in
   the orchestrator issues Multipart Cost Property Service queries to
   network A, B and C, respectively.  Denote the available bandwidth
   that can be assigned to T1 as x1 and that to T2 as x2.  Assume the
   linear inequalities computed by the three networks are:

                         A: x1 + x2 <= 10Mbps
                         B: x1 <= 3Mbps
                         C: x2 <= 3Mbps

   If the ALTO servers use the first mechanism to directly return their
   resource information to ALTO client, respectively, each of them will
   send a cost map and a property map response encoding its own linear
   inequality to the ALTO client.  In this way, the orchestrator gets
   the accurate information about networking resource sharing between
   (s1, d1) and (s2, d2).  It then can invoke a resource allocation
   algorithm to allocate the resources to tasks T1 and T2.  For example,
   if the goal is to maximize the minimal bandwidth of two tasks, the
   allocation decision will be to assign endpoints s1 and d1 to T1, with
   a bandwidth of 3Mbps, and assign endpoints s2 and d2 to T2, with a
   bandwidth of 3Mbps as well.

8.  ALTO Extension: Privacy-Preserving Interdomain Information
    Aggregation for Resource Discovery

   This section describes a customized ALTO extension in Unicorn that
   supports the privacy-preserving discovery of networking resource
   sharing among a set of candidate endpoint pairs.

8.1.  Extension Specification

   Figure 6 presents the workflow of the proposed ALTO extension.
   Assume a set of N member networks denoted as AS_1, AS_2, ...  AS_N
   and the number of all candidate endpoint pairs is F.  The interdomain
   information aggregation process works as follows:

                               Aggregation.

   o  Step 1: The ALTO client sends the Multipart Cost Property Service
      request to and a homomorphic public key k_p to each member
      network.

   o  Step 2: The ALTO server of each network AS_i computes its own set
      of linear inequalities A_i x <= b_i.  Denote the size of this set
      as m_i.

   o  Step 3: The ALTO server of each network AS_i introduces m_i non-
      negative slack variables to transform its set of linear
      inequalities into a set of linear equations.

   o  Step 4: The ALTO servers of all member networks use a private
      matrix SMPC summation protocol to collectively compute k=m_1 + m_2
      + ... + m_N + 1.  The value k is known to all the member networks.

   o  Step 5: The ALTO servers of each network AS_i selects a random k-
      by-m_i matrix P_i, and computes the matrix P_iA_i and P_ib_i.

   o  Step 6: The ALTO server of each network then uses a few matrices,
      which are only shared with a couple of other networks, to further
      obfuscate P_iA_i and P_ib_i, and sends the obfuscated matrices to
      the ALTO client via symmetric encryption.

   o  Step 7: the ALTO client decrypts the received responses from all
      ALTO servers, and sums up the decrypted response to get a set of
      linear equations sum P_iA_i x = sum P_ib_i.

   This process ensures that the networking resource capacity region
   derived from sum P_iA_i x = sum P_ib_i is the same as that derived
   from A_1 x <= b_1, A_2 x <= b_2, ... A_N x <= b_N.  More importantly,
   the ALTO client has no knowledge on the information of network
   resource sharing of a single member network.

8.2.  Example

   This subsection uses the same example in Figure 5 to illustrate the
   privacy-preserving information aggregation process.  The set of
   linear inequalities computed by each network is as follows:

                         A: x1 + x2 <= 10
                         B: x1 <= 3
                         C: x2 <= 3

   Then the networks collectively compute k=1+1+1+1=4.  And then
   introduces slack variables to transform the linear inequalities into
   linear equations:

                         A: x1 + x2 + x3           <= 10
                         B: x1           + x4      <= 3
                         C:      x2           + x5 <= 3

   For each network, the random matrix it chooses as follows:

                         P_A: [11, 49, 95, 34]
                         P_B: [58, 22, 75, 25]
                         P_C: [50, 69, 89, 95]

   After the obfuscating process in Step 5 and Step 6 in the previous
   subsection, the decrypted set of linear equations the ALTO client
   gets is

                   69  x1 + 61  x2 + 11 x3 + 58 x4_ + 50 x5 = 434
                   71  x1 + 118 x2 + 49 x3 + 22 x4_ + 69 x5 = 763
                   170 x1 + 184 x2 + 95 x3 + 75 x4_ + 89 x5 = 1442
                   59  x1 + 129 x2 + 34 x3 + 25 x4_ + 95 x5 = 700

   Assume the goal is still to maximize the minimal bandwidth of two
   tasks, the allocation decision made using this set of linear
   equations will still be x1=3 and x2=3, i.e., assigning endpoints s1
   and d1 to T1, with a bandwidth of 3 and assigning endpoints s2 and d2
   to T2, with a bandwidth of 3 as well.

9.  Discussion

9.1.  Discovering the Domain-Paths Using a New Interdomain Routing
      Protocol

   The current design of the endpoint path discovery process in Unicorn
   assumes that the underlying interdomain routing protocol is the
   standard BGP, which only provides the path vector of ASes instead of
   the path vector of (ingress, AS) tuples needed by Unicorn.  If a
   multi-domain, geo-distributed data analytics system uses an
   interdomain routing protocol that provides the path vector of
   (ingress, AS) pairs, the endpoint path discovery process in Unicorn
   can be simplified to only send queries to the ALTO server of the
   network where the source candidate endpoint locates.

10.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any privacy or security issue not
   already present in the ALTO protocol.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not define any new media type or introduce any new
   IANA consideration.
