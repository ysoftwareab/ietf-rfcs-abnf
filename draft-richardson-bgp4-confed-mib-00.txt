Abstract


   This memo is an extension to the SNMP MIB.  It specifies an IAB
   standards track protocol for the Internet community, and requests
   discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This memo extends
   the MIB defined in [BGP-MIB].


   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.  Please forward comments to
   idr@merit.net.




1. Introduction


   This memo defines extensions to the MIB defined in [BGP-MIB].  In
   particular, it describes managed objects based upon attributes defined
   in "Autonomous System Confederations for BGP" [RFC1965].


2. Overview


   These objects are used to control and manage a BGP-4 implementation
   that supports AS Confederations [RFC1965].

   This MIB defines a system-wide scalar object, and extends one table
   defined in [BGP-MIB]:  the BGP Peer Table.

   This MIB defines the following primary objects:

    - bgpConfederationId { bgp 12 1 }

      The locally configured Confederation ID Number.

    - bgpPeerConfedTable { bgp 12 2 }

      Whether each peer is in the same Confederation as the router.
