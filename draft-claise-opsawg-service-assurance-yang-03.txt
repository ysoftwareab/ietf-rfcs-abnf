2.  Introduction

   The "Service Assurance for Intent-based Networking Architecture"
   draft-claise-opsawg-service-assurance-architecture, specifies the
   framework and all of its components for service assurance.  This
   document complements the architecture by providing open interfaces
   between components.  More specifically, the goal is to provide YANG
   modules for the purpose of service assurance in a format that is:

   o  machine readable

   o  vendor independent

   o  augmentable

3.  YANG Models Overview

   The main YANG module, ietf-service-assurance, defines objects for
   assuring network services based on their decomposition into so-called
   subservices.  The subservices are hierarchically organised by
   dependencies.  The subservices, along with the dependencies,
   constitute an assurance graph.  This module should be supported by an
   agent, able to interact with the devices in order to produce a health
   status and symptoms for each subservice in the assurance graph.  This
   module is intended for the following use cases:

   o  Assurance graph configuration:

      *  Subservices: configure a set of subservices to assure, by
         specifying their types and parameters.

      *  Dependencies: configure the dependencies between the
         subservices, along with their type.

   o  Assurance telemetry: export the health status of the subservices,
      along with the observed symptoms.

   The second YANG module, ietf-service-assurance-device, extends the
   ietf-service-assurance module to add support for the subservice
   DeviceHealthy.  Additional subservice types might be added the same
   way.

   The third YANG module, example-service-assurance-device-acme, extends
   the ietf-service-assurance-device module as an example to add support
   for the subservice DeviceHealthy, with specifics for the fictional
   ACME Corporation.  Additional vendor-specific parameters might be
   added the same way.

              +--rw dependency-type?   identityref

4.2.  Concepts

   The ietf-service-assurance YANG model assumes an identified number of
   subservices, to be assured independently.  A subservice is a feature
   or a subpart of the network system that a given service instance
   might depend on.  Example of subservices include:

   o  DeviceHealthy: whether a device is healthy, and if not, what are
      the symptoms.  Potential symptoms are "CPU overloaded", "Out of
      RAM", or "Out of TCAM".




Claise, et al.            Expires July 16, 2020                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft     YANG Modules for Service Assurance       January 2020


   o  ConnectivityHealthy: given two IP addresses owned by two devices,
      what is the quality of the connection between them.  Potential
      symptoms are "No route available" or "ECMP Imbalance".

   The first example is a subservice representing a subpart of the
   network system, while the second is a subservice representing a
   feature of the network, In both cases, these subservices might depend
   on other subservices, for instance, the connectivity might depend on
   a subservice representing the routing mechanism and on a subservice
   representing ECMP.

   The symptoms are listed for each subservice.  Each symptom is
   specified by a unique id and contains a health-score-weight (the
   impact to the health score incurred by this symptom), a label (text
   describing what the symptom is), and dates and times at which the
   symptom was detected and stopped being detected.  While the unique id
   is sufficient as an unique key list, the start-date-time second key
   help sorting and retrieving relevant symptoms.

   The assurance of a given service instance can be obtained by
   composing the assurance of the subservices that it depends on, via
   the dependency relations.

   In order to declare a subservice MUST provide:

   o  A type: identity inheriting of the base identity for subservice,

   o  An id: string uniquely identifying the subservice among those with
      the same identity,

   o  Some parameters, which should be specified in an augmenting model,
      as described in the next sections.

   The type and id uniquely identify a given subservice.  They are used
   to indicate the dependencies.  Dependencies have types as well.  Two
   types are specified in the model:

   o  Impacting: such a dependency indicates an impact on the health of
      the dependent,

   o  Informational: such a dependency might explain why the dependent
      has issues but does not impact its health.

   To illustrate the difference between "impacting" and "informational",
   consider the subservice InterfaceHealthy, representing a network
   interface.  If the device to which the network interface belongs goes
   down, the network interface will transition to a down state as well.
   Therefore, the dependency of InterfaceHealthy towards DeviceHealthy

Internet-Draft     YANG Modules for Service Assurance       January 2020


   is "impacting".  On the other hand, as a the dependency towards the
   ECMPLoad subservice, which checks that the load between ECMP remains
   ce remains stable throughout time, is only "informational".  Indeed,
   services might be perfectly healthy even if the load distribution
   between ECMP changed.  However, such an instability might be a
   relevant symptom for diagnosing the root cause of a problem.

   Service instances MUST be modeled as a particular type of subservice
   with two parameters, a type and an instance name.  The type is the
   name of the service defined in the network orchestrator, for instance
   "point-to-point-l2vpn".  The instance name is the name assigned to
   the particular instance that we are assuring, for instance the name
   of the customer using that instance.

   The "under-maintenance" and "maintenance-contact" flags inhibit the
   emission of symptoms for that subservice and subservices that depend
   on them.  See Section 3.7 of
   [draft-claise-opsawg-service-assurance-architecture] for a more
   detailed discussion.

   By specifying service instances and their dependencies in terms of
   subservices, one defines the whole assurance to apply for them.  An
   assurance agent supporting this model should then produce telemetry
   in return with, for each subservice: a health-status indicating how
   healthy the subservice is and when the subservice is not healthy, a
   list of symptoms explaining why the subservice is not healthy.

5.3.  Concepts

   As the number of subservices will grow over time, the YANG module is
   designed to be extensible.  A new subservice type requires the
   precise specifications of its type and expected parameters.  Let us

   illustrate the example of the new DeviceHealthy subservice type.  As
   the name implies, it monitors and reports the device health, along
   with some symptoms in case of degradation.

   For our DeviceHealthy subservice definitions, the new device-idty is
   specified, as an inheritance from the base identity for subservices.
   This indicates to the assurance agent that we are now assuring the
   health of a device.

   The typical parameter for the configuration of the DeviceHealthy
   subservice is the name of the device that we want to assure.  By
   augmenting the parameter choice from ietf-service-assurance YANG
   module for the case of the device-idty subservice type, this new
   parameter is specified.

   Under some circumstances, vendor-specific subservice types might be
   required.  As an example of this vendor-specific implementation, this
   section shows how to augment the ietf-service-assurance-device module
   to add support for the subservice DeviceHealthy, specific to the ACME
   Corporation.  The new parameter is acme-specific-parameter.

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.
