1. Introduction

   This draft provides a set of requirements for Abstraction and
   Control of TE Networks (ACTN) identified in various use-cases of
   ACTN. [ACTN-frame] defines the base reference architecture and
   terminology. [ACTN-PS] provides problem statement and gap analysis.

   ACTN refers to the set of virtual network operations needed to
   orchestrate, control and manage large-scale multi-domain TE networks

Internet-Draft            ACTN Requirements                   July 2016


   so as to facilitate network programmability, automation, efficient
   resource sharing, and end-to-end virtual service aware connectivity
   and network function virtualization services.

   These operations are summarized as follows:

      - Abstraction and coordination of underlying network resources
        to higher-layer applications and customers, independent of how
        these resources are managed or controlled, so that these
        higher-layer entities can dynamically control virtual
        networks. Control includes creating, modifying,
        monitoring, and deleting virtual networks.

      - Multi-domain and multi-tenant virtual network operations via
        hierarchical abstraction of TE domains that facilitates
        multi-administration, multi-vendor, and multi-technology
        networks as a single virtualized network. This is achieved by
        presenting the network domain as an abstracted topology to the
        customers via open and programmable interfaces. Hierarchical
        abstraction allows for the recursion of controllers in a
        customer-provider relationship.

      - Orchestration of end-to-end virtual network services and
        applications via allocation of network resources to meet
        specific service, application and customer requirements.

      - Adaptation of customer requests (made on virtual resources) to
        the physical network resources performing the necessary
        mapping, translation, isolation and, policy that allows
        conveying, managing and enforcing customer policies with
        respect to the services by the network to said customer.

      - Provision of a computation scheme and virtual control
        capability via a data model to customers who request virtual
        network services. Note that these customers could, themselves,
        be service providers.

   ACTN solutions will build on, and extend, existing TE constructs and
   TE mechanisms wherever possible and appropriate.  Support for
   controller-based approaches is specifically included in the possible
   solution set.

3.1. Two categories of requirements

   This section provides a summary of use-cases in terms of two
   categories: (i) service-specific requirements; (ii) network-related
   requirements.

   Service-specific requirements listed below are uniquely applied to
   the work scope of ACTN. Service-specific requirements are related to
   virtual service coordination function defined in Section 3. These
   requirements are related to customer's VNs in terms of service
   policy associated with VNs such as service performance objectives,
   VN endpoint location information for certain required service-
   specific functions (e.g., security and others), VN survivability
   requirement, or dynamic service control policy, etc.

   Network-related requirements are related to virtual network
   operation function defined in Section 3. These requirements are
   related to multi-domain and multi-layer signaling, routing,
   protection/restoration and synergy, re-optimization/re-grooming,
   etc. These requirements are not inherently unique for the scope of
   ACTN but some of these requirements are in scope of ACTN, especially

     related parameters
   - Dynamic Policy enforcement

   8. VN lifecycle management/operation
   - Create (same as VN instantiate Request)
   - Delete
   - Modify
   - Update (VN level OAM Monitoring) under policy agreement
   9. Coordination of multi-destination service requirement/policy
     to support dynamic applications such as VM migration,
     disaster recovery, load balancing, etc.
   - Service-policy primitives and its parameters


     4.2. MPI Requirements

Internet-Draft            ACTN Requirements                   July 2016


   Requirement
   1. Security/Policy negotiation (who are you?)
   - Exchange of key, etc.
   - Domain preference + local policy exchange
   - Push/Pull support
   - Preferred peering points
   - Preferred route
   - Reroute policy
   - End-point mobility (for multi-destination)
   2. Topology Query /Response (Pull Model from MDSC to PNC: Please
     give me your domain topology)
   - TED Abstraction level negotiation
   - Abstract topology (per policy)
        o Node/Link metrics
        o Node/Link Type (Border/Gateway, etc.)
        o All TE metrics (SRLG, etc.)
        o Topology Metrics (latency, B/W available, etc.)

   3. Topology Update (Push Model from PNC to MDSC)
   - Under policy agreement, topology changes to be pushed to MDSC
     from PNC

   4. VN Path Computation Request (From MDSC to PNC: Please give me
     a path in your domain)
   - VN Instance ID (Note: this is passed from CNC to MDSC)
   - End-point information
   - CE ends
   - Border points (if applicable)
   - All other PCE request info (PCEP)

   5. VN Path Computation Reply (here's the path info per your
     request)
   - Path level abstraction
   - LSP DB
   - LSP ID ??
   - VN ID

   6. Coordination of multi-domain Centralized Signaling (MSDC
     operation) Path Setup Operation
   - MSDC computes E2E path across multi-domain (based on abstract
     topology from each PNC)
   - MDSC determines the domain sequence
   - MDSC request path signaling to each PNC (domain)
   - MDSC finds alternative path if any of the PNCs cannot find its
     domain path
        o PNC will crankback to MDSC if it cannot find its domain

Internet-Draft            ACTN Requirements                   July 2016


          path
        o PNC will confirm to MDSC if it finds its domain path
   7. Path Restoration Operation (after an E2E path is setup
     successfully, some domain had a failure that cannot be
     restored by the PNC domain)
   - The problem PNC will send this notification with changed
     abstract topology (computed after resource changes due to
     failure/other factors)
   - MDSC will find an alternate E2E path based on the changes
     reported from PNC. It will need to update the E2E abstract
     topology and the affected CN's VN topology in real-time (This
     refers to dynamic synchronization of topology from Physical
     topology to abstract topology to VN topology)
   - MDSC will perform the path restoration signaling to the
     affected PNCs.
   8. Coordination of Multi-destination service restoration
     operation (CNC have, for example, multiple endpoints where the
     source endpoint can send its data to either one of the
     endpoints)
   - When PNC reports domain problem that cannot be resolved at
     MDSC level because of there is no network restoration path to
     a given destination.
   - Then MDSC has Customers' profile in which to find the customer
     has "multi-destination" application.
   - Under policy A, MDSC will be allowed to reroute the customer
     traffic to one of the pre-negotiated destinations and proceed
     with restoration of this particular customer's traffic.
   - Under policy B, CNC may reroute on its VN topology level and
     push this to MDSC and MDSC maps this into its abstract
     topology and proceed with restoration of this customer's
     traffic.
   - In either case, the MDSC will proceed its restoration
     operation (as explained in Req. 6) to the corresponding PNCs.

   9. MDSC-PNC policy negotiation is also needed as to how
     restoration is done across MDSC and PNCs.

   10.   Generic Abstract Topology Update per changes due to new
     path setup/connection failure/degradation/restoration
   11.   Service-specific Abstract Topology Update per changes due
     to new path setup/connection failure/degradation/restoration
   12.   Abstraction model of technology-specific topology element
