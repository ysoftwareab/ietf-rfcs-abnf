             draft-mohali-sipcore-reason-call-forwarding-00

Abstract

   This document defines a new protocol value "CDIV" for the Reason
   Header field and a new IANA Registry for registering Call Forwarding
   service reasons.  This new value enables signaling that a request has
   been retargeted as a result of a Call Forwarding service invocation.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft    Reason extension for Call Forwarding      October 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Reason header field defined in [RFC3326] provides a mechanism to
   signal the reason why a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) request or
   response was issued.  This document requests IANA registration of a
   new protocol value "CDIV" for the Reason Header field and a new IANA
   Registry for registering Call Forwarding reasons.  This extension
   enables to indicate that a request has been retargeted as a result of
   a Call Forwarding service invocation.

   [RFC4244] defines a SIP header field, History-Info, to provide a
   standard mechanism for capturing requests history information.  This
   allows receiving applications to determine hints about how and why
   the call arrived at the application/user.  The History-Info header
   field can contain an optional reason, by including the Reason Header
   [RFC3326] escaped in the hi-targeted-to-uri field.

   There are situations where a call is retargeted as a result of
   receiving a SIP response (e.g. 3XX response) in which case the Reason
   Header contains the SIP status code.  There are other situations
   where a call is retargeted as a result of a Call Forwarding service
   invocation by an application server (e.g.  Call Forwarding
   Unconditional).  The extension of the Reason header defined in the
   present document covers the second type of situation and allows to
   convey the identification of such service in the signalling.  This
   might help other applications/entities invoked downstream to take
   appropriate decisions to avoid undesired service interactions or to
   take advantage of this information (eg. delivering the appropriate
   voicemail announcement).

   Note: [RFC3326] states that a SIP message MAY contain more than one
   Reason value (i.e., multiple Reason lines), but all of them MUST have
   different protocol values and an implementation is free to ignore
   Reason values that it does not understand.


2.  Terminology

   o  Call Forwarding: the term "Call Forwarding" is used in this
      document to refer to the supplementary service defines, among
      others, in [TS_24.604] and also called "Communication Diversion
      (CDIV)".  Both terminologies are considered identical in this
      document.

   o  Retargeting: the term "retargeting" is used in this document to
      refer to the process of changing a Uniform Resource Identifier
      (URI) in a request during a session establishment as described in
      [RFC4244].

Internet-Draft    Reason extension for Call Forwarding      October 2010


3.  Reason header extension

   The syntax of the Reason Header as defined in [RFC3326] is as
   follows:


 Reason             =  "Reason" HCOLON reason-value *(COMMA reason-value)
  reason-value      =  protocol *(SEMI reason-params)
  protocol          =  "SIP" / "Q.850" / token
  reason-params     =  protocol-cause / reason-text
                       / reason-extension
  protocol-cause    =  "cause" EQUAL cause
  cause             =  1*DIGIT
  reason-text       =  "text" EQUAL quoted-string
  reason-extension  =  generic-param



   This document adds a new protocol value for the protocol field of the
   Reason header :

   "CDIV": The cause parameter contains a Call Forwarding cause code.

   When this protocol value is used, the protocol-cause and the reason-
   text fields shall be set to values registered in a new IANA Registry
   for registering Call Forwarding types.


   We define the following Call Forwarding cause codes:

Value   Default Text                    Description
-----   ------------                    -------------
 1      Unknown/not available           The call has been diverted for
                                        an unknow/not available reason.

 2      User Busy                       The call has been diverted because
                                        the UE was determined busy.

 3      No reply                        The call has been diverted because
                                        the UE has not replied within a
                                        defined period of time.

 4      Unconditional                   The call has been diverted
                                        unconditionally.

 5      Deflection during alerting      The call has been diverted because
                                        the UE requested the redirection
                                        during the alerting phase.

 6      Deflection immediate response   The call has been diverted because
                                        of an immediate redirecting
                                        response to the INVITE.

 7      Mobile subscriber not reachable The call has been diverted because
                                        the UE is not reachable.

 8      Not Logged-in                   The call has been diverted because
                                        the UE is not registered (logged-in).


   For retargets that are the result of a Call Forwarding service, a
   Reason MUST be associated with the hi-targeted-to-uri field of the
   diverting user in the History-Info header.  If the Call Forwarding
   invocation is the result of a SIP response, a Reason header
   containing the SIP response code MUST also be included in the same
   History-Info entry.


4.  Example

   The following example illustrates the case where the Reason header is
   inserted in the History-Info header during a retargeting by a Call
   Forwarding service running in a SIP Application Server.


   Reason: CDIV ;cause=6 ;text="Deflection immediate response"

   In this example, Alice calls Bob. Bob answers with an immediate
   redirecting request.  Bob's proxy determines that Bob wants to
   forward Alice to Bob's voicemail.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds to one existing IANA Registry and creates one new
   Registry according to Section 27 of [RFC3261].


   The existing IANA Registry for the SIP Reason Header is as follows:

      Protocol Value   Protocol Cause            Reference
      --------------   --------------            ---------
      SIP              Status code               RFC 3261
      Q.850            Cause value in decimal    ITU-T Q.850
      Preemption       Cause value in decimal    RFC 4411

   This document adds to that Registry with the following entry:

      Protocol Value   Protocol Cause            Reference
      --------------   --------------            ---------
      CDIV             Cause value in decimal    [RFCXXXX]


   Below is a new IANA Registry for SIP Reason Header reason-text
   strings and reason-param cause values, associated with the protocol
   value "CDIV".  Per [RFC3326], the reason-text string is a quoted
   default string with only human understandability meant.  These
   strings can be changed by local policy.

   The following cause values and associated reason text are defined:

                   Reason-
      Protocol     param      Reason-text                     Reference
      --------     -------    ------------                    ---------
      CDIV         Cause=1    Unknown/Not available           [RFCXXXX]
      CDIV         Cause=2    User busy                       [RFCXXXX]
      CDIV         Cause=3    No reply                        [RFCXXXX]
      CDIV         Cause=4    Unconditional                   [RFCXXXX]
      CDIV         Cause=5    Deflection during alerting      [RFCXXXX]
      CDIV         Cause=6    Deflection immediate response   [RFCXXXX]
      CDIV         Cause=7    Mobile subscriber not reachable [RFCXXXX]
      CDIV         Cause=8    Not Logged-in                   [RFCXXXX]




   Note to the RFC-Editor: RFCXXXX should be replaced by this RFC
   reference when available.

   The cause values created by the CDIV Protocol namespace in this
   document are defined in Section 3.  Each cause value has a Reason-
   text string as a general description of what the cause value is for.
   Section 4 provides an example for the above cause codes with a
   message flow diagram.

   The above cause values are included in this registry.  New cause
   values can be added and are allocated as First Come First Served.
