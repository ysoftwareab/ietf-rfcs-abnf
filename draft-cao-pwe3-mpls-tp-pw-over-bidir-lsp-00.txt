Abstract 

   Currently a Pseudowire (PW) uses two reverse unidirectional LSPs as 
   Packet Switching Network (PSN) tunnels, and each PE of a PW or 
   segment of MS-PW selects PSN tunnels independently. In contrast 
   MPLS-TP requires support for both bidirectional and unidirectional 
   LSPs. In addition some transport services may require bidirectional 
   traffic follows with congruent paths. Therefore, PWs may be required 
   to use PSN tunnels with congruent paths. 

   This document specifies some extensions to LDP that ensures both 
   ends of a PW (or segment PW) select and bind to the same 
   bidirectional LSP or use unidirectional LSPs with congruent paths.

1. Introduction 

   Pseudo Wire (PW) Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) is a mechanism to 
   emulate a number of layer 2 services, such as Asynchronous Transfer 
   Mode (ATM), Frame Relay or Ethernet, etc. Such services are emulated 
   between two Attachment Circuits (ACs) and the PW encapsulated layer 
   2 service payload is carried through Packet Switching Network (PSN)

   tunnels between Provider Edges (PEs). Today PWE3 generally uses two 
   reverse unidirectional Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) or Resource 
   ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) LSPs as PSN 
   tunnels, and each of the PEs selects and binds PSN tunnel 
   independently. Today there is no architectural provision as there 
   has been no requirement to explicitly associate a PW with a PSN 
   tunnel. 

   For transport applications it has been identified that some 
   transport services may require bidirectional traffic to follow 
   congruent paths. When bidirectional LSPs are used as PSN tunnels, 
   this requirement can be fulfilled if both PEs of a specific/segment 
   PW select and bind to the same bidirectional LSP(s). In the case of 
   unidirectional LSPs, LSPs with congruent paths need to be selected 
   to support the PW. However, current mechanisms cannot guarantee 
   appropriate mapping of PWs to underling LSPs. This is especially 
   true when there are multiple unidirectional/bidirectional LSPs that 
   may be used to provide different levels of Quality of Service (QOS) 
   or protection between the PEs.

                      Figure 1  SS-PW scenario 

   Above figure (Figure 1) is an example of this inconsistent binding 
   in Single-Segment PW (SS-PW) scenario. There are two bidirectional 
   LSPs (LSP1 and LSP2, along diverse paths) and a PW (PW1) between PE1 
   and PE2. With the current mechanisms, it's possible that PE1 may 
   select LSP1 (PE1-P1-P2-PE2) as the PSN tunnel for the direction of 
   PE1->PE2 of PW1, and PE2 may select LSP2 (PE1-P3-PE2) as the PSN 
   tunnel for the direction of PE2->PE1 of PW1, so a PW is bound to two 
   separate bidirectional LSPs, this may not be desired in MPLS-TP 
   network. It still has the same problems in Multi-Segment PW (MS-PW) 
   scenario. 

   One possible method is binding the PSN tunnel manually at each PE, 
   but this is prone to configuration errors and it is difficult to 
   maintain a large number of PWs in such a manner. To allow for 
   minimal manual intervention and configuration, this draft discusses 
   an automatic solution by extending FEC 128/129 PW based on [RFC4447].

2. PW to LSP Binding TLV 

   In this document two new OPTIONAL TLVs are defined: IPv4/IPv6 PW to 
   LSP Binding TLV. They are used to communicate the selected LSPs 
   between the two PEs of a PW or segment of MS-PW. 

   When using LDP to signal the PW, the identifiers of the LSP are 
   carried in the Label Mapping message utilizing the new TLVs defined 
   in this document.  

   And the PW to LSP Binding TLV MAY be carried in an in-band MPLS-TP 
   OAM message that is identified by a new dedicated GACh channel type 
   when LDP is not used. This is for future study. 

   The proposed format of the PW to LSP Binding LSP TLVs is as follows, 
   the value fields are derived from the definition of [I-D.ietf-mpls-
   tp-identifiers].  

   (Editor notes: In I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers, a LSP is identified 
   by the combination of Src-Global_ID, Src-Node_ID, Src-Tunnel_Num, 
   Dst-Global_ID, Dst-Node_ID, Dst-Tunnel_Num, LSP_Num, this is fine 
   for unidirectional and co-routed bidirectional LSP, but it is not 
   enough for associated bidirectional LSP that is combined with two 
   reverse unidirectional LSPs and hence two LSP_Nums are required.)

                 Figure3 IPv6 PW to LSP Binding TLV format 

   As defined in [RFC3209] and [RFC3473], an RSVP-TE LSP is identified 
   by the combination of LSP ID, Tunnel ID, Tunnel Extended ID, Tunnel 
   end point address, Tunnel sender address, and a mapping between 
   these fields to the fields of IPv4/v6 PW to LSP Binding TLV is 
   needed. The mapping defined in Section 5.3 of [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-
   identifiers] applies here.  

   In addition, for co-routed bidirectional LSP, since the Source and 
   Destination Tunnel/LSP ID is the same, Destination Tunnel Number and 
   Destination LSP Number MUST be set to the same as the Source Tunnel 
   Number and Source LSP Number, respectively. 

   For associated bidirectional LSP, Destination Tunnel Number and 
   Destination LSP Number MUST be set to the Tunnel ID and LSP ID of 
   the reverse direction component LSP of the associated bidirectional 
   LSP, respectively. 

   For unidirectional LSPs, when the reverse direction tunnel LSP is 
   determined in advance (e.g., in an active/passive mode, the active 
   end may explicitly specify the reverse tunnel LSP for a PW), 
   Destination Tunnel Number and Destination LSP Number SHOULD be set 
   to the Tunnel ID and LSP ID of the reverse LSP, respectively. If the 
   reverse direction tunnel LSP can not be determined in advance,

   Destination Tunnel Number and Destination LSP Number MUST be set to 
   zero. 

   (Editor     notes:     In     I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers,     the 
   Source/Destination Node is defined as a 32-bits ID, but for a 
   MPLS/GMPLS TE based LSP, the Tunnel Extended ID, Tunnel end point 
   address and Tunnel sender address may be IPv6 addresses, so the 
   current Source/Destination Node ID does not cover this and can not 
   map to IPv6 based Tunnel Extended ID, Tunnel end point address and 
   Tunnel sender address.) 

3. LDP Extensions  

   Before sending a Label Mapping message to setup a PW or Segment PW, 
   a PE has to select candidate LSPs for PSN tunnel. The selected LSPs 
   are carried by the PW to LSP binding TLV and then sent with the 
   Label Mapping message to the target/switching PE. Therefore, there 
   may be some collisions of tunnel LSP selection when both PEs of the 
   PW or Segment PW assume active role and independently signal the PW 
   or Segment PW. In order to reduce and resolve the collision of 
   tunnel selection, two types of PEs are identified here:  

   a) Active PE: the PE which initiates the selection of the tunnel 
   LSPs and informs the remote PE;  

   b) Passive PE: the PE which obeys the active PE's suggestion. 

   The role of a PE is based on the role that it acts in the signaling 
   of the PW. There exist two situations: 

   Active/Active - Both PEs of a PW or Segment PW assume active (e.g., 
   SS-PW, LDP using FEC 128 MS-PW). 

   Active/Passive - One PE is Active and the others are passive (e.g., 
   LDP using FEC 129 MS-PW). 

3.1.1. Active/Active Signaling Procedures 

   In bidirectional LSP scenario, both PEs (say PE1 and PE2) send a 
   Label Mapping message carrying their own selected bidirectional LSP 
   to each other. If the bidirectional LSP in the received message from 
   other PE is as same as it was in the Label Mapping message sent by 
   itself, then the PW signaling has converged on an mutually agreed 
   tunnel LSP and is completed. Otherwise, when the bidirectional LSP 
   selected by one PE (say PE1) differ from the bidirectional LSP 
   selected by the other PE (say PE2), PE1 and PE2 have to make a 

 
 
Chen, et al.           Expires January 5, 2011                [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft            PW to LSP Binding                  July 2010 
    

   choice between two tunnel LSPs. In this case PE1 and PE2 can compare 
   the Node ID and the LSP selected by the node with higher ID will be 
   determined to carry the PW. 

   In case of unidirectional LSPs, each PE may select an unidirectional 
   tunnel LSP that is used for its own forward direction of the PW and 
   send it with the Label Mapping message to each other, hence to help 
   the PEs to select two congruent unidirectional LSPs. The mechanisms 
   to determine which LSPs are used are out of scope. In addition, each 
   PE may explicitly specify both the forward and reverse direction 
   tunnel LSPs of the PW and send them with the Label Mapping message 
   to each other. If the two PEs of the PW have the same tunnel 
   selection (e.g., for a specific PW, the forward direction tunnel LSP 
   selected by one PE is the same as the reverse direction tunnel LSP 
   selected by the other PE, and vice versa), then the PW signaling is 
   completed and has converged on an mutually agreed tunnel LSPs. 
   Otherwise, when the tunnel LSPs selected by one PE differ from the 
   tunnel LSPs selected by the other PE, the LSPs selected by the node 
   with higher Node ID will be determined as the tunnel.  

3.1.2. Active/Passive Signaling Procedures 

   The active/passive role election is defined in the Section 7.2.1 of 
   [SEG-PW] and applies here, this document does not define any new 
   role election procedures. 

3.1.2.1. Active PE Signaling Procedure  

   Before sending the Label Mapping message, the active PE, say PE1, 
   MUST select the tunnel LSPs for the PW or Segment PW. Then PE1 
   generates a PW to LSP Binding TLV that identifies the selected LSP 
   and sends the Label Mapping message containing it to the passive PE, 
   in this case PE2.  

   In case of bidirectional LSPs, if PE1 receives a Label Mapping 
   message in which the bidirectional LSP is the same as the 
   bidirectional LSP it selected then both directions of the PW or 
   Segment PW are setup. 

   In case of unidirectional LSPs, if PE1 specifies both the forward 
   and reverse direction tunnel LSPs in a previous Label Mapping 
   message sent by itself, when PE1 receives a Label Mapping message in 
   which the reverse tunnel LSP is the same as the forward tunnel LSP 
   and the forward tunnel LSP is the same as the reverse tunnel LSP it 
   selected, then both directions of the PW or segment PW are setup.

Internet-Draft            PW to LSP Binding                  July 2010 
    

3.1.2.2. Passive PE Signaling Procedure  

   When a Label Mapping message carrying a PW to LSP Binding TLV is 
   received by the passive PE (say PE2) it may decide, based on local 
   policy and/or success or failure in matching the LSP to accept or 
   reject it.      

   If the suggested tunnel LSPs cannot be matched successfully or if 
   local policy prohibits its acceptance, a Label Release message MUST 
   be sent, with a "No matched tunnel LSPs" code, and the processing of 
   the Label Mapping message is complete.  

   If the tunnel LSPs proposed by PE1 are accepted by PE2 then PE2 
   attempts setup of the PW in the opposite (PE2->PE1) direction, it 
   sends a Label Mapping message to PE1, with a PW to LSP Binding TLV 
   that identifies the tunnel LSPs, proposed by PE1, that it has 
   accepted for this PW. That is, for bidirectional LSPs, the PW to LSP 
   Binding TLV SHOULD identify the same bidirectional LSP proposed by 
   PE1. In case of unidirectional LSPs, if the received PW to LSP 
   Binding TLV including both forward and reverse direction tunnel LSPs, 
   the Source Tunnel Number and LSP Number of the PW to LSP Binding LSP 
   SHOULD be exchanged for each other. Accordingly, the 
   Source/Destination Node ID/Global ID of the PW to LSP Binding TLV 
   SHOULD be exchanged as well. 

4. Security Considerations  

   The draft does not introduce any new security issues. 

5. IANA Considerations  

5.1. LDP TLV Types 

   This document defines two new TLVs [Section 2 of this document] for 
   inclusion in LDP Label Mapping message. IANA is required to assigned 
   TLV type values to the new defined TLVs from LDP "TLV Type Name 
   Space" registry.  

   IPv4 PW to LSP Binding TLV - TBD 

   IPv6 PW to LSP Binding TLV - TBD
