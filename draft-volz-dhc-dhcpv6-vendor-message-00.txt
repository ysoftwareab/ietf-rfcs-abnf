Internet-Draft       DHCPv6 Vendor-specific Message        February 2007


1.  Introduction

   The DHCPv6 [2] protocol specifies a mechanism for the assignment of
   both IPv6 address and configuration information to IPv6 nodes.  The
   protocol provides for 256 possible message codes, of which [2]
   assigns 13.  And, 65536 possible option codes, of which less than 50
   are assigned at the time of this writing.  Each of these message and
   option codes have specific purposes.  New message and option codes
   are assigned through IETF Standards Action as defined in [4] (see
   Section 24 of [2]).

   There may be a need for vendors of DHCPv6 clients, relay agents, or
   servers to experiment with new capabilities that require new messages
   to be exchanged between these elements.  Thus, this document defines
   the format for and requests that a new message code, and a range of
   options, be reserved for vendor-specific and experimental purposes.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].


3.  Vendor-specific Message

   The vendor-specific message may be exchanged between clients, relay
   agents, and/or servers and allows multiple vendors to make use of the
   message for completely different and independent purposes.

   Clients and servers MAY chose to support this message; those that do
   not, MUST discard the message.  Relay agents SHOULD relay these
   messages as they would other DHCPv6 messages unless the relay agent
   understands the specific message and knows that the message was
   directed at it.

   Applications using these messages MUST NOT assume that all DHCPv6
   clients, relay agents, and servers support them and MUST use good
   networking practices when transmitting and retransmitting these
   messages (see Section 14 of [2] for recommendations).  For some
   applications, it may be appropriate to use a Vendor Class or Vendor-
   specific Information Option ([2]) in a standard DHCPv6 exchange to
   negotiate whether the end-points support this new message.

   The format of the Vendor-specific Message is shown below:

       |                                                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       msg-type             VENDOR-SPECIFIC (to-be-assigned)

       enterprise-number    The vendor's registered Enterprise Number as
                            registered with IANA [3].

       vendor-data          The vendor's message data.


   The contents and format of the vendor-data field is up to the vendor.


4.  Reserved Options

   This document also requests IANA to reserve 256 option codes (65024
   to 65279, inclusive) for use only within the Vendor-specific message.
   These option codes MUST NOT be used within the DHCPv6 messages
   specified in [2], and clients and servers SHOULD discard any of these
   messages containing one or more of these option codes.

   The reason for reserving these option codes is so that Vendor-
   specific messages that wish to encapsulate DHCPv6 options and also
   make use of "private" options, do not have to encode "private"
   options within the Vendor-specific Information Option (as that would
   duplicate the enterprise-number and potentially many times if options
   are needed at multiple encapsulation levels).


5.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of [2] apply.

   This new message does potentially open up new avenues of attacking

   clients, relay agents, or servers.  The exact nature of these attacks
   will depend on what functions and capabilities the message exposes
   and are thus not possible to describe in this document.  Clients and
   servers that have no use for these messages SHOULD discard them and
   thus the threat is no different than before this message was
   assigned.

   Vendors using this new message should use the DHCPv6 security
   mechansims (the Auth option or IPsec [2] as appropriate) and
   carefully consider the security implications of the functions and
   capabilities exposed.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign DHCPv6 Message type 254 to the Vendor-
   specific Message in the registry maintained in
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters:

      254 VENDOR-SPECIFIC

   IANA is requested to reserve DHCPv6 Option Codes from 65024 to 65279,
   inclusive, as VENDOR-SPECIFIC message options in the registry
   maintained in http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters:

      65025 - 65279 - VENDOR-SPECIFIC message option codes (MUST NOT
      appear in other DHCPv6 messages)
