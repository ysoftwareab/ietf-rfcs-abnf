Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects used for
   managing DS3 and E3 interfaces.  This document is a companion
   document with Definitions of Managed Objects for the DS1/E1/DS2/E2
   and SONET/SDH Interface Types, rfc1406 [6]
    and rfc1595 [7].

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
   to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
   definitions.

   This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.

   This document entirely replaces RFC 1407.

1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of three major
     components.  They are:

   o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms used for
        describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

   o    the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] - the core set of managed
        objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

   o    the protocol, RFC 1157 [3] and/or RFC 1905 [4], - the protocol
        for accessing managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
   the object type.

2.1.  Changes from RFC1407

   This MIB obsoletes RFC1407.  The changes from RFC1407 are the
   following:

        (1)  The Fractional Table has been deprecated

        (2)  This document uses SMIv2

        (3)  Values are given for ifTable and ifXTable

        (4)  Example usage of ifStackTable is included

        (5)  dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex have been deprecated

        (6)  The definition of valid intervals has been clarified
             for the case where the agent proxied for other
             devices.  In particular, the treatment of missing
             intervals has been clarified.

        (7)  An inward loopback has been added.

        (8)  Additional lineStatus bits have been added for Near End
             in Unavailable Signal State, Carrier Equipment Out of
             Service, DS@ Payload AIS, and DS@ Performance Threshold

        (9)  A line Length object has been added.

        (10) Added a lineStatus last change, trap and enabler.

3.  Overview

   These objects are used when the particular media being used to
   realize an interface is a DS3/E3 interface.  At present, this applies
   to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-standard MIB:

        ds3 (30)

   The DS3 definitions contained herein are based on the DS3
   specifications in ANSI T1.102-1987, ANSI T1.107-1988, ANSI T1.107a-
   1990, and ANSI T1.404-1989 [8,9,9a,10].  The E3 definitions contained
   herein are based on the E3 specifications in CCITT G.751 [12].

3.1.  Use of ifTable for DS3 Layer

   Only the ifGeneralGroup needs to be supported.

           ifPhysAddress     The value of the Circuit Identifier.
                             If no Circuit Identifier has been assigned
                             this object should have an octet string with
                             zero length.

           ifAdminStatus     Supports read-only access.
                             The desired administrative status of the
                             interface.

                              cases such as DS3/E3 over AAL1/ATM where
                              false(2) is appropriate


3.2.  Using ifStackTable

   The objects dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex have been deprecated.
   These objects previously allowed a very special proxy situation to
   exist for Routers and CSUs. This section now describes how to use
   ifStackTable to represent this relationship.

   The paragraphs discussing dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex have been
   preserved in Appendix A for informational purposes.

   External&Internal interface scenario: the SNMP Agents resides on an
   host external from the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces (e.g., a
   router). The Agent represents both the host and the DS3/E3 device.

   Example:

   A shelf full of CSUs connected to a Router. An SNMP Agent residing on
   the router proxies for itself and the CSU. The router has also an
   Ethernet interface:

   various DS3 interfaces.

3.3.  Objectives of this MIB Module

   There are numerous things that could be included in a MIB for DS3/E3
   signals:  the management of multiplexors, CSUs, DSUs, and the like.
   The intent of this document is to facilitate the common management of
   all devices with DS3/E3 interfaces.  As such, a design decision was
   made up front to very closely align the MIB with the set of objects

   that can generally be read from DS3/E3 devices that are currently
   deployed.

3.4.  DS3/E3 Terminology

   The terminology used in this document to describe error conditions on
   a DS3 interface as monitored by a DS3 device are based on the
   definitions from the ANSI T1.231 standard [11].  If the definition in
   this document does not match the definition in the ANSI T1.231
   document, the implementer should follow the definition described in
   this document.

3.4.1.  Error Events

          Bipolar Violation (BPV) Error Event
            A bipolar violation error event, for B3ZS(HDB3)-coded
            signals, is the occurrence of a pulse of the same polarity
            as the previous pulse without being part of the zero
            substitution code, B3ZS(HDB3).  For B3ZS(HDB3)-coded
            signals, a bipolar violation error event may also include
            other error patterns such as:  three(four) or more
            consecutive zeros and incorrect polarity. (See T1.231)

          Excessive Zeros (EXZ) Error Event
            An EXZ is the occurrence of any zero string length equal
            to or greater than 3 for B3ZS, or greater than 4 for HDB3.
            (See T1.231)

          Line Coding Violation (LCV) Error Event
            This parameter is a count of both BPVs and EXZs
            occurring over the accumulation period.  An EXZ
            increments the LCV by one regardless of the length
            of the zero string.

          P-bit Coding Violation (PCV) Error Event
            For all DS3 applications, a coding violation error
            event is a P-bit
            Parity Error event.  A P-bit Parity Error event is the
            occurrence of a received P-bit code on the DS3 M-frame
            that is not identical to the corresponding locally-
            calculated code. (See T1.231)

          C-bit Coding Violation (CCV) Error Event
            For C-bit Parity and SYNTRAN DS3 applications, this is
            the count of coding violations reported via the C-bits.

INTERNET-DRAFT                 DS3/E3 MIB                  February 1996


            For C-bit Parity, it is a count of CP-bit parity errors
            occurring in the accumulation interval.  For SYNTRAN, it
            is a count of CRC-9 errors occurring in the accumulation
            interval. (See T1.231)


3.4.2.  Performance Parameters

   All performance parameters are accumulated in fifteen minute
   intervals and up to 96 intervals (24 hours worth) are kept by an
   agent.  Fewer than 96 intervals of data will be available if the
   agent has been restarted within the last 24 hours.  In addition,
   there is a rolling 24-hour total of each performance parameter.

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute interval and any wall clock;
   however some agents may align the fifteen minute intervals with
   quarter hours.

   Performance parameters are of type Gauge32 because it is possible for
   these objects to decrease.  Objects may decrease when Unavailable
   Seconds occurs across a fifteen minutes interval boundary. See
   Unavailable Seconds discussion later in this section.
          Line Errored Seconds (LES)
            A Line Errored Second is a second in which one or more CV
            occurred OR one or more LOS defects.  (See T1.231)

          P-bit Errored Seconds (PES)
            An PES is a second with one or more PCVs OR one or more
            Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS. This
            gauge is not incremented when UASs are counted. (See T1.231)

          P-bit Severely Errored Seconds (PSES)
            A PSES is a second with 44 or more PCVs OR one or more
            Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS. This
            gauge is not incremented when UASs are counted. (See T1.231)

          C-bit Errored Seconds (CES)
            An CES is a second with one or more CCVs OR
            one or more Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS.
            This count is only for the SYNTRAN and C-bit Parity DS3
            applications. This gauge is not incremented when UASs are
            counted. (See T1.231)

          C-bit Severely Errored Seconds (CSES)

INTERNET-DRAFT                 DS3/E3 MIB                  February 1996


            A CSES is a second with 44 or more CCVs OR
            one or more Out of Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS.
            This count is only for the SYNTRAN and C-bit Parity DS3
            applications.  This gauge is not incremented when UASs
            are counted. (See T1.231)

          Severely Errored Framing Seconds (SEFS)
            A SEFS is a second with one or more Out of Frame defects
            OR a detected incoming AIS. (See T1.231)

          Unavailable Seconds (UAS)
            UAS are calculated by counting the number of seconds that
            the interface is unavailable.  The DS3 interface is said
            to be unavailable from the onset of 10 contiguous PSESs, or
            the onset of the condition leading to a failure (see Failure
            States).  If the condition leading to the failure was
            immediately preceded by one or more contiguous PSESs, then
            the DS3 interface unavailability starts from the onset of
            these PSESs.  Once unavailable, and if no failure is
            present, the DS3 interface becomes available at the onset
            of 10 contiguous seconds with no PSESs.  Once unavailable,
            and if a failure is present, the DS3 interface becomes
            available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no
            PSESs, if the failure clearing time is less than
            or equal to 10 seconds.  If the failure clearing time is
            more than 10 seconds, the DS3 interface becomes available
            at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with no PSESs, or
            the onset period leading to the successful clearing
            condition, whichever occurs later. With respect to the
            DS3 error counts, all counters are incremented
            while the DS3 interface is deemed available.  While the
            interface is deemed unavailable, the only count that is
            incremented is UASs. (See T1.231)

            A special case exists when the 10 or more second period
            crosses the 900 second statistics window boundary, as the
            foregoing description implies that the PSES and UAS
            counters for the PREVIOUS interval must be adjusted when
            the Unavailable Signal State is entered. Clearly,
            successive GETs of the affected dsx3IntervalPSESs and
            dsx3IntervalUASs objects will return differing values
            if the first GET occurs during the first few seconds of
            the window.  This is viewed as an unavoidable side-effect

            To summarize, when the unavialable state is entered, SES
            is reduced by 10 and UAS is increased by 10.  The linkDown
            trap is sent at the start of the unavailable period, but
            the time on the trap will be tate of the first UAS,
            (i.e. 10 seconds earlier).

            The UAS effect can be acheived by using a delay technique.
            This is described in Appendix B.


3.4.3.  Performance Defects

          Failure States:
            The Remote Alarm Indication (RAI) failure, in SYNTRAN
            applications, is declared after detecting
            the Yellow Alarm Signal on the alarm channel.  See ANSI
            T1.107a-1990 [9a]. The Remote Alarm Indication failure,
            in C-bit Parity DS3 applications, is declared
            as soon as the presence of either one or two alarm signals
            are detected on the Far End Alarm Channel.  See [9].
            The Remote Alarm Indication failure may also be declared
            after detecting the far-end SEF/AIS defect (aka yellow).
            The Remote Alarm Indication failure is cleared as soon as
            the presence of the any of the above alarms are removed.

            Also, the incoming failure state is declared when a defect
            persists for at least 2-10 seconds.  The defects are
            the following:  Loss of Signal (LOS), an Out of Frame (OOF)
            or an incoming Alarm Indication Signal (AIS).
            The Failure State is cleared when the defect is absent
            for less than or equal to 20 seconds.

          Far End SEF/AIS defect (aka yellow)
            A Far End SEF/AIS defect is the occurrence of the two X-bits
            in a M-frame set to zero.  The Far End SEF/AIS defect is
            terminated when the two X-bits in a M-frame are set to
            one. (See T1.231)

          Out of Frame (OOF) defect
            A DS3 OOF defect is detected when any three or more errors
            in sixteen or fewer consecutive F-bits occur within a DS3
            M-frame.  An OOF defect may also be called a Severely
            Errored Frame (SEF) defect.  An OOF defect is cleared when
            reframe occurs.  A DS3 Loss of Frame (LOF) failure is
            declared when the DS3 OOF defect is consistent for 2 to 10

            seconds.  The DS3 OOF defect ends when reframe occurs.
            The DS3 LOF failure is cleared when the DS3 OOF
            defect is absent for 10 to 20 seconds. (See T1.231)

            An E3 OOF defect is detected when four consecutive frame
            alignment signals have been incorrectly received in there
            predicted positions in an E3 signal. E3 frame alignment
            occurs when the presence of three consecutive frame
            alignment signals have been detected.

          Loss of Signal (LOS) defect
            The DS3 LOS defect is declared upon observing 175 +/- 75
            contiguous pulse positions with no pulses of either
            positive or negative polarity.
            The DS3 LOS defect is terminated upon observing an average
            pulse density of at least 33% over a period of 175 +/- 75
            contiguous pulse positions starting with the receipt of a
            pulse. (See T1.231)

          Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) defect
            The DS3 AIS is framed with "stuck stuffing."  This implies
            that it has a valid M-subframe alignments bits, M-frame
            alignment bits, and P bits.  The information bits are set
            to a 1010... sequence, starting with a one (1) after each
            M-subframe alignment bit, M-frame alignment bit, X bit, P
            bit, and C bit.  The C bits are all set to zero giving
            what is called "stuck stuffing."  The X bits are set to
            one. The DS3 AIS defect is declared after DS3 AIS is
            present in contiguous M-frames for a time equal to or
            greater than T, where 0.2 ms <= T <= 100 ms.
            The DS3 AIS defect is terminated after AIS is absent in
            contiguous M-frames for a time equal to or greater than T.

            The E3 binary content of the AIS is nominally a continuous
            stream of ones.  AIS detection and the application of
            consequent actions, should be completed within a time
            limit of 1 ms. (See T1.231)


3.4.4.  Other Terms
          Circuit Identifier
            This is a character string specified by the circuit
            vendor, and is useful when communicating with the vendor
            during the troubleshooting process.

                      the interface shall always return this as
                      it's value.

                    dsx3PayloadLoop
                      The received signal at this interface is looped
                      through the device.  Typically the received signal
                      is looped back for retransmission after it has
                      passed through the device's framing function.

                    dsx3LineLoop
                      The received signal at this interface does not
                      go through the device (minimum penetration) but
                      is looped back out.

                    dsx3OtherLoop
                      Loopbacks that are not defined here.

                    dsx3InwardLoop

          -- logical interface, i.e., an entry in the interfaces table
          -- from the Internet-standard MIB.

          -- carrying router traffic, a feed for voice, a feed for video,
          -- and a synchronous channel for a non-routed protocol.
          -- We might describe the allocation of channels, in the

5.  Appendix A - Use of dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex

   Different physical configurations for the support of SNMP with DS3/E3
   equipment exist. To accommodate these scenarios, two different
   indices for DS3/E3 interfaces are introduced in this MIB.  These
   indices are dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex.

   External interface scenario: the SNMP Agent represents all managed
   DS3/E3 lines as external interfaces (for example, an Agent residing
   on the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces directly):

   For this scenario, all interfaces are assigned an integer value equal
   to ifIndex, and the following applies:

      ifIndex=dsx3IfIndex=dsx3LineIndex for all interfaces.

   The dsx3IfIndex column of the DS3/E3 Configuration table relates each
   DS3/E3 interface to its corresponding interface (ifIndex) in the
   Internet-standard MIB (MIB-II STD 17, RFC1213).

   External&Internal interface scenario: the SNMP Agents resides on an
   host external from the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces (e.g., a

   router). The Agent represents both the host and the DS3/E3 device.
   The index dsx3LineIndex is used to not only represent the DS3/E3
   interfaces external from the host/DS3/E3-device combination, but also
   the DS3/E3 interfaces connecting the host and the DS3/E3 device.  The
   index dsx3IfIndex is always equal to ifIndex.

   Example:

   A shelf full of CSUs connected to a Router. An SNMP Agent residing on
   the router proxies for itself and the CSU. The router has also an
   Ethernet interface:

   For this example, ifNumber is equal to 5.  Note the
   following description of dsx3LineIndex:
   the dsx3LineIndex identifies a DS3/E3 Interface on a managed
   device.  If there is an ifEntry that is directly associated with
   this and only this DS3/E3 interface, it should have the same value
   as ifIndex.  Otherwise, number the dsx3LineIndices with an unique
   identifier following the rules of choosing a number greater
   than ifNumber and numbering inside interfaces (e.g., equipment
   side) with even numbers and outside interfaces
   (e.g, network side) with odd numbers.

   If the CSU shelf is managed by itself by a local SNMP Agent,
   the situation would be:


           ifIndex (= dsx3IfIndex)                      dsx3LineIndex

                   1      Line#A     Network Side            1

6.  Appendix B - The delay approach to Unavialable Seconds.

   According to ANSI T1.231 unavailable time begins at the _onset_ of 10
   contiguous severely errored seconds -- that is, unavailable time
   starts with the _first_ of the 10 contiguous SESs.  Also, while an
   interface is deemed unavailable all counters for that interface are
   frozen except for the UAS count.  It follows that an implementation
   which strictly complies with this standard must _not_ increment any
   counters other than the UAS count -- even temporarily -- as a result
   of anything that happens during those 10 seconds.  Since changes in
   the signal state lag the data to which they apply by 10 seconds, an
   ANSI-compliant implementation must pass the the one-second statistics
   through a 10-second delay line prior to updating any counters.  That
   can be done by performing the following steps at the end of each one
   second interval.

   i)   Read near/far end CV counter and alarm status flags from the
        hardware.

INTERNET-DRAFT                 DS3/E3 MIB                  February 1996


   ii)  Accumulate the CV counts for the preceding second and
        compare them to the ES and SES threshold for the layer
        in question.  Update the signal state and shift the
        one-second CV counts and ES/SES flags into the 10-element
        delay line.  Note that far-end one-second statistics are
        to be flagged as "absent" during any second in which there
        is an incoming defect at the layer in question or at any
        lower layer.

   iii) Update the current interval statistics using the signal
        state from the _previous_ update cycle and the one-second
        CV counts and ES/SES flags shifted out of the 10-element
        delay line.

   This procedure is illustrated below for a SONET interface.  Similar
   rules would apply for DS1 and DS3 interfaces.  Note that the
   procedure guarantees that the statistical counters will be correctly
   updated at all times, although they will lag real time by 10 seconds.
   Each 15 minutes one would transfer the current interval counts into
   the previous interval counts and drop the oldest set of interval
   counts off the cliff.  Note that signal state calculations would
   _not_ start afresh at each interval boundary;  signal state
   information _would_ be carried across interval boundaries.  A scheme
   similar to this one has been used at least one DS1 product I know of
   -- the Tektronix/LP COM TC-2000 PCM test set.  This product was first
   put on the market in 1987 and featured G.821 performance statistics
   collected in the manner shown below.

       Figure X.  Accumulation of SONET/SDH performance statistics.

   Adopting such a procedure would, however, raise another issue:  for
   the first ten seconds after a system comes up the interface is in an
   unknown state.  It would be necessary to allow for up to ten seconds
   of dead time during the current interval.  Hence the dsx1TimeElapsed,
   dsx1FarEndTimeElapsed, dsx3TimeElapsed, dsx3FarEndTimeElapsed, and
   sonetMediumTimeElapsed objects _would_ need to be replaced by objects
   that allow for the possibility that _no_ valid data has yet been
   collected for the current interval.  Here are some possible

   These objects should assume the value 0 whenever there are no current
   interval statistics to report.  That would happen if the interface
   was off-line (e.g., in a disabled or testing state) and (in an
   implementation which fully complies with ANSI T1.231 UAS definition)
   during the initial 10-second period after the interface is brought
   on-line.
