     Abstract

     This document is one in the series of  documents  that  define
     various  MIB object groups for IPv6.  Specifically, the ICMPv6
     group is defined in this document.

     This memo defines an experimental portion  of  the  Management

     Information   Base  (MIB)  for  use  with  network  management
     protocols in the IPv6-based internets.

     This document specifies a MIB module in a manner that is  both
     compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the
     peer SNMPv1 definitions.

     1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

     The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework presently consists  of
     three major components.  They are:

     o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1] - the mechanisms  used
          for  describing  and  naming  objects  for the purpose of
          management.

     o    the MIB-II, described in  RFC 1213/STD 17 [3] - the  core
          set   of  managed  objects  for  the  Internet  suite  of
          protocols.

     o    RFC 1157 [4] and RFC 1905 [5] which define  two  versions
          of  the  protocol  used  for  network  access  to managed
          objects.

     The Framework permits  new  objects  to  be  defined  for  the
     purpose of experimentation and evaluation.



     1.1.  Object Definitions

     Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information  store,
     termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
     MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract  Syntax  Notation
     One  (ASN.1)  defined  in the SMI.  In particular, each object
     type is named by an  OBJECT  IDENTIFIER,  an  administratively
     assigned  name.   The  object  type  together  with  an object
     instance serves to uniquely identify a specific  instantiation
     of  the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual
     string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.

     2.  Overview

     This document is the one  in  the  series  of  documents  that
     define  various  MIB  object groups for IPv6. These groups are
     the basic unit of conformance: if the semantics of a group  is
     applicable  to  an  implementation, then it must implement all
     objects in that group.  For example,  an  implementation  must
     implement  the  TCP group if and only if it implements the TCP
     over  IPv6  protocol.   At   minimum,   implementations   must
     implement  the  IPv6  General  group [8] as well as the ICMPv6
     group defined in this document.

     This document defines the ICMPv6 group of the IPv6 MIB.

     6.  Security Considerations

     Certain management information defined  in  this  MIB  may  be
     considered sensitive in some network environments.

     Therefore,  authentication  of  received  SNMP  requests   and
     controlled access to management information should be employed
     in such environments.
