          Revision to Capability Codes Registration Procedures
           draft-ietf-idr-capabilities-registry-change-05.txt

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 5492 by making a change to the registration
   procedures for BGP Capability Codes.  Specifically, the range
   formerly designated "Reserved for Private Use" is divided into three
   new ranges, respectively designated as "First Come First Served",
   "Experimental" and "Reserved".

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5492] designates the range of Capability Codes 128-255 as
   "Reserved for Private Use".  Subsequent experience has shown this to
   be not only useless, but actively confusing to implementors.  BGP
   Capability Codes do not meet the criteria for "Private Use" described
   in [RFC8126] section 4.1.  An example of a legitimate "private use"
   code point might be a BGP community [RFC1997] value assigned for use
   within a given Autonomous System, but no analogous use of
   Capabilities exists.

   Accordingly, this document revises the registration procedures for
   the range 128-255, as follows, using the terminology defined in
   [RFC8126]:

   o  128-238: First Come First Served
   o  239-254: Experimental Use
   o  255: Reserved

   The procedures for the ranges 1-63 and 64-127 are unchanged,
   remaining "IETF Review" and "First Come First Served" respectively.

2.  Discussion

   The reason for providing an Experimental Use range is to preserve a
   range for use during early development.  Although there are few
   practical differences between Experimental and Private Use, the
   change both makes it clear that code points from this space should
   not be used long-term or in shipping products, and reduces the
   consumption of the scarce Capability Code space expended for this
   purpose.  Once classified as Experimental, it should be considered
   difficult to reclassify the space for some other purpose in the
   future.

   The reason for reserving the maximum value is that it may be useful
   in the future if extension of the number space is needed.

   The reason for designating "IESG" as the change controller for all
   registrations is that while it should be easy to obtain a Capability
   Code, once registered it's not a trivial matter to safely and
   interoperably change the use of that code, and thus working group
   consensus should be sought before changes are made to existing
   registrations.

   Finally, we invite implementors who have used values in the range
   128-255 to contribute to this draft, so that the values can be
   included in the registry.  Values that have been reported, are
   included.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to revise the "Capability Codes" registry in the
   "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group as follows.

   Reference: [RFC5492] and this document.

   Registry Owner/Change Controller: IESG

   Registration procedures:

                   +---------+-------------------------+
                   |  Range  | Registration Procedures |
                   +---------+-------------------------+
                   |   1-63  | IETF Review             |
                   |  64-238 | First Come First Served |
                   | 239-254 | Experimental            |
                   |   255   | Reserved                |
                   +---------+-------------------------+

   Note: a separate "owner" column is not provided because the owner of
   all registrations, once made, is "IESG".

   IANA is requested to perform the following new allocations within the
   "Capability Codes" registry:

4.  Security Considerations

   This revision to registration procedures does not change the
   underlying security issues inherent in the existing [RFC5492] and
   [RFC4271].
