Abstract 
    
   Exchange of routing information between IPsec security gateways, 
   using standard routing protocols across IPsec tunnels, can be a 
   straightforward operation. Using the routing information to choose 
   the proper path is also straightforward, when routing is 
   functionally separated from the IPsec gateway operation. One of the 
   most significant obstacles to widespread implementation of dynamic 
   routing in IPsec VPNs has been agreement on a way to unambiguously 
   signal the capability of the gateways to exchange and use the 
   routing information. This document describes a simple and secure 
   method of signaling this capability and exchanging dynamic routing 
   information between IPsec security gateways, using standard IPsec 
   messages. This method is currently in use in a large number of 
   installations.

2. Overview 
    
   Dynamic exchange of routing information between the various sites of 
   a Virtual Private Network (VPN) can significantly simplify the 
   management of the VPN. Without dynamic routing, it is difficult to 
   configure a large number of routes correctly and in a timely manner. 
   It is even more difficult to set up load balancing and failover when 
   the configuration is static. IPsec offers tremendous promise as a 
   VPN technology, since it can securely connect sites over any IP

   network, within a service provider's IP network or over the 
   Internet.   
    
   However, no specific method of accomplishing dynamic routing in an 
   interoperable manner has been defined within existing IPsec 
   standards. This document describes a method by which standard IPsec 
   mechanisms can support the secure exchange of dynamic routing 
   protocols over an IPsec tunnel, and use the routing information to 
   dynamically direct traffic. Most IP routing protocols can be 
   transported natively over standards-compliant IPsec implementations 
   using this method.  
    
   This method fits in the framework for provider-provisioned customer 
   premises (CE)-based IPsec VPNs discussed in [CE-FRAME].  
    
   Three key elements are needed to support dynamic routing in an IPsec 
   VPN environment: 
    
   1) Agreement between each pair of connected VPN sites to participate 
   in a dynamic routing connection. This requires a secure and 
   unambiguous signaling method. 
    
   2) Creation of a secure link between each pair of connected VPN 
   sites. This is referred to as a "tunnel link" in this document. Any 
   traffic passing through the "tunnel link" is protected by IPsec. The 
   "tunnel link" will securely transmit any IP traffic sent over it.  
    
   3) Ability to use the "tunnel links" in a manner analogous to simple 
   link connections, and route the traffic between sites over them. 
   Route policy, packet filtering, and firewall capabilities can be 
   applied to the traffic before it is sent over the "tunnel links", 
   delivering overall functionality similar to the use of dedicated 
   encryptors on links between routers.  
    
   The implementation described in this document uses a transport mode 
   proposal in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Quick Mode [RFC-2409] 
   exchange to properly express the restrictions on the traffic in an 
   IPsec-compliant method. However, since the proposal specifies the 
   use of IP-in-IP [RFC-2003] encapsulation, the gateways actually send 
   all inter-site traffic, including the routing information, in 
   packets that are exactly the same as a tunnel mode packet. It allows 
   the creation of a "tunnel link," which can carry all traffic, 
   including routing updates, within the secure IPsec tunnel. 
    
   Some of the perceived limitations of direct transport of routing 
   protocols within IPsec tunnels are the result of limitations of 
   specific implementations, and not limitations of IPsec itself. In 
   particular, IPsec does not preclude the transport of multicast or 
   broadcast IP traffic. Thus OSPF [RFC-2328], which uses multicast, 
   can be carried over IPsec tunnels and can be used by the IPsec 
   gateways for dynamic routing.

3.  Routing in IPsec 
    
   This section discusses the "routing problem" for IPsec, and 
   describes how "tunnel links" can transport normal routing protocols 
   as well as inter-site VPN traffic securely over IPsec. 
 
3.1 IPsec background 
    
   The IP Security Architecture, defined in [RFC-2401], requires IPsec-
   compliant hosts or gateways to formulate a security policy 
   regulating how they will communicate with other hosts and networks.  
   The standard defines a Security Policy Database (SPD), which much be 
   consulted for every inbound and outbound packet to decide whether 
   that packet can bypass IPsec, or whether the packet requires IPsec 
   processing, or perhaps that the packet must be dropped. 
    
   When IPsec processing is required, an appropriate IPsec security 
   association (SA) for the packet needs to be found.  If a SA does not 
   currently exist, the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) is used to 
   dynamically establish a pair of new SAs (one in each direction). As 
   part of the IKE Quick Mode exchange defined in [RFC-2409] which 
   establishes new IPsec SAs, the IKE peer initiating the Quick Mode 
   exchange may send client identifiers which specify the traffic which 
   will be allowed through the new security associations. The allowable 
   traffic is specified in terms of source and destination addresses, 
   or networks and ranges of addresses, with optional protocol and 
   source and destination ports.    
    
   This background information is necessary to understand that an IPsec 
   SA, whether operating in tunnel or transport mode, is not normally a 
   "data pipe" through which any and all IP traffic may be sent. The 
   client identifiers determine what is and is not allowed. Moreover, 
   these identifiers are fixed at the time the SA is established.  To 
   allow any other traffic to pass, a new SA pair needs to be 
   negotiated. 
 
3.2 IPsec routing issues 
    
   Since the destination address of a packet (along with other 
   selectors) can determine which SA applies to a packet and thus which 
   tunnel the packet may pass through, it is difficult to apply dynamic 
   routing techniques to an IPsec VPN built with standard security 
   associations. If the SAs specify particular networks, then these 
   specifications must override any routing protocol decisions, to 
   comply with IPsec. 
 
   Support for dynamic routing between IPsec gateways must be added to 
   the IPsec scenario just described, to make configuration of multiple 
   IPsec VPN sites tractable, as opposed to the static routing - the 
   full specification of the local and remote networks - which seems to 
   be implied within IPsec.  As described in [TOUCH], there are a

               draft-knight-ppvpn-ipsec-dynroute-00.txt  February 2002 
    
   number of difficulties with dynamic routing while using standard 
   IPsec approaches, chief of which are: 
   - dynamic updating of SAs with each routing change is unwieldy, and 
   may lead to security issues 
   - the SA database does not by definition contain interface 
   information, and cannot adapt to changes. 
    
   Another discussion of issues constraining dynamic routing in IPsec 
   VPNs is presented in [WANG]. Although generally useful, it appears 
   to misidentify some implementation-specific issues as IPsec issues, 
   such as IPsec tunnel endpoint attachment and a lack of support for 
   multicast and broadcast traffic. 
 
   One method of supporting dynamic routing within IPsec would be to 
   negotiate one security association just to pass the routing protocol 
   in question, then once it is known what networks are available on 
   the other side, negotiate separate security associations for each 
   and every network on the fly, potentially dropping some as later 
   routing updates show changes to the configuration.  
    
   Even if this were done, there is no guarantee that any other 
   implementation would actually use the routing information to 
   establish the necessary dynamic security policy database entries, 
   since the IPsec specifications contain no requirement to support 
   such dynamic changes to security policy. Therefore, this scheme is 
   unlikely to lead to true interoperability, and the additional 
   complexity of managing multiple security associations (and the 
   dynamic policy entries necessary to support them) is a further 
   drawback to this scheme. 
    
   What is proposed in this document instead is the "tunnel link" 
   approach: one security association pair between the two gateways, 
   which will carry both the routing protocols themselves and all 
   subsequent traffic between the networks on both sides. This requires 
   that the gateway must use the dynamic routing information in 
   addition to the configured SA database entries for routing through 
   the "tunnel links." Of course, any other required security 
   restrictions must be applied by the routing functionality before 
   traffic is allowed to enter the "tunnel links." This approach 
   combines the proven encryption protection of IPsec with the 
   manageability and traffic control capabilities of current routing 
   technology.  
 
3.3 "Tunnel Link" Approach 
    
   The first step to dynamic routing is to set up IPsec gateway 
   connections that will allow ALL inter-site traffic to pass through 
   an IPsec tunnel. Since this IPsec tunnel can carry all IP traffic, 
   including broadcast and multicast traffic, it is in some ways 
   similar to a link layer connection, and is referred to here as a 
   "tunnel link."

               draft-knight-ppvpn-ipsec-dynroute-00.txt  February 2002 
    
   A "tunnel link" can be constructed using either IPsec tunnel mode or 
   by using a transport mode signal. In either case, the packets are 
   handled as tunnel mode packets. 
 
3.3.1 Tunnel Mode "Tunnel Link" 
    
   Most standards-compliant IPsec gateway implementations can be 
   configured with interoperable "tunnel links" using tunnel mode.  
    
   A "tunnel link" can be established by negotiating a tunnel mode SA 
   as follows: 
    
   In the Quick Mode exchange, specify "wildcards" as client 
   identifiers.  This means the Identification Payload (ref RFC 
   2407)[RFC-2407] is set to ID_IPV4_ADDR_SUBNET (value 4) for ID Type, 
   and the network mask of the Identification Data field is set to all 
   zeros (wildcard). Although the IP address in the Identification Data 
   field is irrelevant using the wildcard netmask, 0.0.0.0 should be 
   used for clarity. 
    
   This might appear to be a good way to begin to solve the IPsec 
   routing issue. However, since IPsec does not provide many facilities 
   for signaling, it is not currently feasible for one IPsec gateway to 
   determine if another IPsec gateway can provide the capabilities for 
   dynamic routing over the "tunnel link," when it is constructed using 
   a tunnel mode proposal. Since a number of IPsec implementations can 
   provide a "tunnel link" over tunnel mode connections, but not 
   support dynamic routing, an approach should be used which will avoid 
   confusion. 
 
3.3.2 Transport Mode Proposal to Signal "Tunnel Link" 
 
   In order to support dynamic routing unambiguously, some additional 
   signaling method must be used. The signaling method proposed in this 
   document is the use of a particular transport mode proposal. This is 
   discussed in detail in section (3.4.3).  
    
   It should be noted that [RFC-2401] states in section 4.1 that 
   security gateways must use tunnel mode SAs. In addition to the 
   encapsulation protection of tunnel mode, this is also due to the 
   need to avoid potential problems with fragmentation and reassembly 
   of IPsec packets, and in circumstances where multiple paths exist to 
   the same destination.  Thus it is critical that the packets in the 
   "tunnel link" be encapsulated and decapsulated as tunnel mode 
   packets. 
    
   The transport mode proposal is used as a signal, but a "tunnel link" 
   is created, and the ability to perform dynamic routing is also 
   signaled. 
    
     
   Knight                Expires August 2002                  [Page 6]


               draft-knight-ppvpn-ipsec-dynroute-00.txt  February 2002 
    
   The Quick Mode proposal employed for this signal should be 
   unambiguously useful for this purpose, since the proposal would 
   apparently otherwise be in conflict with [RFC-2401]. 
 
3.3.3 Routing over a "Tunnel Link" 
    
   The following discussion applies to any kind of "tunnel link." 
 
   It should be emphasized that routing information can be carried 
   through a "tunnel link."  IPsec gateways can encapsulate normal 
   routing update messages and send them to each other through the 
   "tunnel link." RIP can be propagated with no special considerations. 
   OSPF can treat the "tunnel link" as an unnumbered point-to-point 
   network. BGP can also be implemented. 
    
   There may be a limitation in an IPsec implementation that does not 
   allow an IPsec tunnel to be recognized as an IP interface. For such 
   an implementation, routing protocols such as RIP and OSPF that are 
   dependent on IP interfaces cannot be defined directly on the IPsec 
   tunnel, and may not be able to send and receive routing information 
   in this way. This is not an IPsec issue, but is implementation-
   specific.   
    
   A "tunnel link" essentially provides a connection for any IP traffic 
   between IPsec gateways. The gateways must have the ability to use 
   them for dynamic routing. The gateway implementation must coordinate 
   the application of routing updates with other security restrictions 
   expressed in IPsec or configured by other methods. A description of 
   these implementation details is beyond the scope of this document, 
   since it depends intimately on the internal architecture of each 
   IPsec gateway. However, interoperability of dynamic routing between 
   most IPsec gateway implementations that provide routing capabilities 
   should be feasible using the method described in this document. 
 
3.4 Signaling Methods  
    
   One crucial issue is how to express in IKE Quick Mode the desire to 
   establish a "tunnel link" security association which allows for 
   dynamic routing, while at the same time ensuring that various IPsec 
   gateway implementations can still interoperate with "static" (SA-
   based) routing, and not cause confusion between the two (such as 
   another implementation trying to negotiate something which the 
   security gateway would interpret as dynamic routing).   
    
   Three approaches are discussed below. The third method is the method 
   suggested for adoption. 
 
3.4.1 Method 1 - Vendor ID compatibility  
    
   A specific IKE Vendor ID payload can be used on both sides in the 
   Phase I negotiation to ensure that both peers support this method, 
   and thus would be capable of allowing dynamic routing through a 
     
   Knight                Expires August 2002                  [Page 7]


               draft-knight-ppvpn-ipsec-dynroute-00.txt  February 2002 
    
   tunnel.  During Quick Mode, assuming compatible gateways on both 
   sides, send a Quick Mode proposal that is understood by both sides 
   to signal the creation of the tunnel link. 
    
   For example, a tunnel mode proposal could be sent without client 
   identifier payloads. Normally, negotiating tunnel mode security 
   associations without client identifiers implies that only the tunnel 
   endpoints (gateways) may communicate through the resulting security 
   association pair. However, when using this vendor-specific ID, this 
   use of Quick Mode client identifiers (or actually the lack of them) 
   would be interpreted as defining a "tunnel link." This approach 
   could be acceptable as a known proprietary solution. 
 
   The biggest problem with this method is the reliance on a Quick Mode 
   proposal that can easily be interpreted differently by another 
   implementation. Also, the use of the Vendor ID payload is 
   problematic, as it then means that either all implementations would 
   have to use the specific Vendor ID. It is far better to use a Quick 
   Mode proposal that will be unambiguous to all implementations, even 
   those that do not support dynamic routing. Method 3, described 
   below, solves these issues. 
 
3.4.2 Method 2 - Notify Message or new IPsec message 
    
   An alternative method might use an IPsec Notify Message, a newly-
   specified IPsec extension, or perhaps a new Encapsulation Mode value 
   to communicate the intent to set up the "tunnel link."  This 
   approach is likely to be non-interoperable for some period, and has 
   not been explored in detail. 
 
3.4.3 Method 3 - Transport Mode with IP-in-IP  
    
   An interoperable approach must allow the Quick Mode proposal to 
   express a request for a "tunnel link" connection with dynamic 
   routing, without any possibility of misinterpretation by an 
   implementation that does not support dynamic routing. The proposed 
   method to do this may seem counterintuitive, but it is a correct 
   method within IPsec. It uses a transport mode proposal with client 
   identifiers and protocol identification to express the same 
   capabilities as the tunnel mode "tunnel link" discussed above.  
    
   A more general approach to this method is discussed in detail in 
   [TOUCH], and labeled "IIPtran."  
 
   We assume that the initial ISAKMP Security Association (SA) has 
   already been established in Phase 1 between the gateways. This 
   ISAKMP SA is used to protect the negotiations for Phase 2, in which 
   a Quick Mode negotiation establishes the IPsec SA. 
    
   This Quick Mode proposal should specify a transport (NOT tunnel) 
   mode SA, with client identifiers consisting of the gateway 
   addresses, and a protocol value of 4, signifying IP-in-IP. 
     
   Knight                Expires August 2002                  [Page 8]


               draft-knight-ppvpn-ipsec-dynroute-00.txt  February 2002 
    
 
   The traffic sent will actually be constructed exactly the same as 
   IPsec tunnel mode traffic, but the SA traffic restrictions will be 
   evaluated according to the proposal for transport mode. 
 
   Since transport mode identifiers are applied to the outermost IP 
   header, the syntax is correct for expressing the "restrictions" on 
   the traffic being passed. IPsec tunnel mode packets use the gateway 
   addresses as the source and destination addresses. IPsec tunnel mode 
   packets are constructed such that the "next payload" field of either 
   AH or ESP is always IP-in-IP (4), so the IPsec packets passed 
   through are consistent with the transport mode restrictions placed 
   by the client identifiers.  
    
   Essentially, this method places no restrictions on the inner IP 
   header, but it does specify, through its use of IP-in-IP as a 
   transport mode protocol, that there will always be an inner IP 
   header as there is in "normal" tunnel mode.   
    
   As noted in [TOUCH], although the packets themselves contain no 
   differentiation as to whether they are tunnel mode or are transport 
   mode carrying IP-in-IP, there are differences in the way that 
   incoming transport and tunnel mode decapsulation is handled. For the 
   method described in this document to work effectively, the receiver 
   must implement a processing rule for type 4 (IP-in-IP) packets so 
   that they will always be decapsulated upon receipt. That is, they 
   must be processed as in tunnel mode. 
    
   Thus the transport mode proposal described here can be interpreted 
   properly by a gateway implementation capable of supporting dynamic 
   routing using "tunnel links." In effect, it is used as an 
   unambiguous signal to establish a "tunnel link."  
 
4. Other considerations 
    
4.1 Interoperability Issues 
    
   Implementations that use this method should provide the following 
   functionality:  
   a) be able to negotiate the Quick Mode proposal for the "tunnel 
   link" described in this document in section 3.4.3 
   b) be able to send, receive, and appropriately process the routing 
   messages over the "tunnel links" 
   c) be able to use the routing information to direct traffic to the 
   appropriate "tunnel link", using the routes which have been learned 
   d) be able to apply configured route policies to the learned routes  
   e) be able to apply packet filtering, and (optionally) firewall 
   capabilities to the traffic before it is sent over the "tunnel 
   link."  
    
   This method of signaling the "tunnel link" should be restricted to 
   this specific use. The only purpose for sending this proposal should 
     
   Knight                Expires August 2002                  [Page 9]


               draft-knight-ppvpn-ipsec-dynroute-00.txt  February 2002 
    
   be to advertise the gateway's ability to support dynamic routing. 
   This Quick Mode proposal should be rejected by an implementation 
   that does not support dynamic routing in this method.  
    
   There is no current alternate interpretation of the client 
   identifiers with IP-in-IP that would cause confusion to 
   implementations that do not support dynamic routing, so it should be 
   safe to use even without any requirement to have cooperating Vendor 
   IDs or other signaling.   
    
   There may be a limitation in an IPsec implementation that does not 
   allow an IPsec tunnel to be recognized as an IP interface. For such 
   an implementation, routing protocols such as RIP and OSPF that are 
   dependent on IP interfaces cannot be defined directly on the IPsec 
   tunnel. An implementation of this type may not be able to use this 
   method for RIP and OSPF, but it can work with BGP. It may have to 
   use another layer of encapsulation, such as GRE [RFC-2784](which can 
   support RIP and OSPF), on top of the IPSec tunnel, or over a 
   transport mode connection. This introduces additional configuration 
   as well as additional packet header overhead, not just for the 
   routing packets, but also for all data that traverses the tunnel. 
   This is not an IPsec issue, but may depend on a specific 
   implementation. Methods of using GRE for this purpose are discussed 
   in [KHETAN]. 
 
4.2 Scalability 
    
   The use of a single IPsec SA per "tunnel link," as described in this 
   document, can significantly increase the number of IPsec VPN 
   connections supported per gateway, compared to alternatives. Since 
   IPsec normally requires a separate IPsec SA per subnet or IP address 
   range, there can potentially be a large number of SAs needed to 
   express the normal routing of multiple subnets between two VPN 
   sites. For the hub sites of large VPNs, this can even drive 
   requirements to use multiple gateways to support all the 
   connections.  Thus using a single SA per connection can simplify VPN 
   design as well as improve system performance. 
    
   One alternative approach to support dynamic routing which has been 
   proposed using GRE [KHETAN] requires maintaining both a GRE tunnel 
   and an IPsec SA per VPN connection, leading to higher overhead and 
   potentially lower performance than the method described in this 
   document.  
 
4.3 OSPF Routing over a "Tunnel Link" 
    
   Since the IPsec gateways will in most cases not have their 
   interfaces in the same subnet, OSPF must be configured to treat the 
   "tunnel link" as an unnumbered point-to-point network.

5. Security Considerations 
    
   This document describes a method of dynamic routing in which the 
   gateway device can use standard routing functionality to perform 
   dynamic routing decisions. Packets are assigned to a specific 
   "tunnel link" SA based on the packet's destination address, using 
   routing information that has been dynamically learned. Each "tunnel 
   link" provides standard IPsec protection for all traffic. All 
   traffic carried in the "tunnel link" between the IPsec gateways is 
   encapsulated in a tunnel mode packet, as required by the Security 
   Architecture for IP [RFC-2401]. 
    
   The use of a "tunnel link" may be controversial at first glance, 
   because traffic control is performed by a routing function rather 
   than through detailed negotiation of multiple IPsec security 
   associations.  However, it should be noted that the "tunnel link" in 
   this case actually expresses the desire of the VPN operator for a 
   connection providing trusted encryption and security across a public 
   network, while allowing manageable dynamic routing within the 
   protection afforded by IPsec. It does not violate the letter or the 
   spirit of IPsec. 
    
   It should be noted that alternative proposals for use of 
   encapsulation over IPsec such as [KHETAN] are actually equivalent in 
   terms of IPsec security, in that they use some routing functionality 
   to determine the desired path, then hide the characteristics of the 
   data within an encapsulated IP packet format, so that most IPsec 
   selectors of the internal packet are not visible.  
 
   Dynamic routing opens possibilities for misdirection of traffic, due 
   to transient conditions or intentional misconfiguration. Since all 
   routing information will be coming from other trusted VPN sites, the 
   security exposure from this source is equivalent to any private 
   network or VPN that exchanges routing information. The internal 
   routing functionality SHOULD provide support for routing policies to 
   manage the learned routes, as well as traffic filtering. 
    
   All VPN traffic crossing the public network between the IPsec 
   gateways will be protected by IPsec using the method described in 
   this document. Tunnel mode packets are used, although the creation 
   of the "tunnel link" is signaled by a proposal for a transport mode 
   SA. Appropriate levels of encryption should be chosen, commensurate 
   with the level of confidentiality required. 
 
6. Summary for Sub-IP Area 
 
6.1 Summary 
    
   The PPVPN WG currently supports three types of VPNs: Provider 
   Provisioned Network Based Layer 3 VPNs, Provider Provisioned Network 
   Based Layer 2 VPNs and Provider Provisioned Customer-Edge Based

   VPNs. This draft discusses the use of standard IPsec capabilities to 
   support routing for CE-based IPSec VPNs. 
 
6.2 Where does it fit in the picture of the Sub-IP work? 
    
   This work fits in the PPVPN box.  Although this work is based on 
   IPsec, it is an application of IPsec, and does not involve changes 
   to IPsec.  Therefore it is not considered within the IPsec Working 
   Group.  Exchange of dynamic routing information between CE-based VPN 
   devices provisioned by service providers is a key enabling 
   technology for allowing scalable IPsec VPN deployments. 
 
6.3 Why is it targeted at this Working Group? 
    
   This document describes how standard IPsec mechanisms can support 
   the tunneling of IP multicast and broadcast packets, so that IPsec 
   VPN tunnels can support dynamic routing protocols over the tunnel.    
    
   Under the current PPVPN WG charter, Provider Provisioned CE-based 
   VPNs fits the scope of the WG, as stated from the following charter 
   extract:  "This working group is responsible for defining and 
   specifying a limited number of sets of solutions for supporting 
   provider-provisioned virtual private networks (PPVPNs). The work 
   effort will include the development of a framework document, a 
   service requirements document and several individual technical 
   approach documents that group technologies together to specify 
   specific VPN service offerings. The framework will define the common 
   components and pieces that are needed to build and deploy a PPVPN. 
   Deployment scenarios will include provider-managed VPN components 
   located on customer premises." 
 
6.4 Justification 
    
   This draft is justified since it targets the routing issue of CE-
   based VPNs, which are identified as a specific type of PPVPNs both 
   in the WG charter and the general framework I-D. CE-based VPN has 
   specific characteristics and operational requirements, including 
   routing support.
