<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>Over its thirty-five year history Internet Mail has undergone
            significant changes in scale and complexity, as it has become a
            global infrastructure service. The first standardized architecture
            for networked email specified little more than a simple split
            between the user world and the transmission world. Core aspects of
            the service, such as the styles of mailbox address and basic message
            format, have remained remarkably constant. However today's Internet
            Mail is distinguished by many independent operators, many different
            components for providing service to users and many others for
            performing message transfer. Public discussion of the service often
            lacks common terminology and a common frame of reference for these
            components and their activities. Having a common reference model and
            terminology facilitates discussion about problems with the service,
            changes in policy, or enhancement to the service's functionality.
            This document offers an enhanced Internet Mail architecture that
            targets description of the existing service, in order to facilitate
            clearer and more efficient technical, operations and policy
            discussions about email.

Introduction</h3>

<p>Over its thirty-five year history Internet Mail has undergone
            significant changes in scale and complexity, as it has become a
            global infrastructure service. The changes have been evolutionary,
            rather than revolutionary, reflecting a strong desire to preserve
            its installed base of users and utility. Today, Internet Mail is
            distinguished by many independent operators, many different
            components for providing service to users and many other components
            for performing message transfer. 
</p>
<p> Public collaboration on email technical, operations and policy
            activities, including those responding to the challenges of email
            abuse, has brought in a much wider range of participants than
            email's technical community originally had. In order to do work on a
            large, complex system, they need to share the same view of how it is
            put together, as well as what terms to use to refer to the pieces
            and their activities. Otherwise, it is difficult to know exactly
            what another participant means. It is these differences in each
            person's perspective that motivates this document, to describe the
            realities of the current system. Internet mail is the subject of
            ongoing technical, operations and policy work, and the discussions
            often are hindered by different models of email service design and
            different meanings for the same terms. This architecture document
            seeks to facilitate clearer and more efficient technical, operations
            and policy exchanges about email. 
</p>
<p>This document offers an enhanced Internet Mail architecture to
            reflect the current service. In particular it:

<a name="rfc.section.1.1"></a><h3>1.1.&nbsp;
Background</h3>

<p>The first standardized architecture for networked email specified
               a simple split between the user world, in the form of <a name='anchor33'></a>
               <a name='anchor34'></a>
               <a name='anchor35'></a>
               <a name='anchor36'></a> Mail User Agents (MUA), and the
               transmission world, in the form of the <a name='anchor37'></a>
               <a name='anchor38'></a> Mail Handling Service (MHS)
               composed of <a name='anchor39'></a>
               <a name='anchor40'></a> Mail Transfer Agents (MTA).
               The MHS is responsible for accepting a message from one User and
               delivering it to one or more others, creating a virtual
               MUA-to-MUA exchange environment. 
</p>
<p>As shown in <a class='info' href='#Basic'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Basic Internet Mail Service Model</span><span>)</span></a> this defines two logical
               "layers" of interoperability. One is directly between Users. The
               other is between the neighboring components, along the transfer
               path. In addition, there is interoperability between the layers,
               first when a message is posted from the User to the MHS and later
               when it is delivered from the MHS to the User. 
</p>
<p>The operational service has evolved sub-divisions for each of
               these layers into more specialized modules. Core aspects of the
               service, such as mailbox addressing and message format style,
               have remained remarkably constant. So the original distinction
               between user-level concerns and transfer-level concerns is
               retained, but with an elaboration to each level of the
               architecture. The term <a name='anchor41'></a><a name='anchor42'></a>"Internet Mail" is used to refer to the entire
               collection of user and transfer components and services. 
</p>
<p>For Internet Mail the term <a name='anchor43'></a>
               "end-to-end" usually refers to a single posting and the set of
               deliveries directly resulting from its single transiting of the
               MHS. A common exception is with group dialogue that is mediated
               via a mailing list, so that two postings occur before intended
               recipients receive an Author's message, as discussed in <a class='info' href='#Mediator'>Section&nbsp;2.1.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mediator</span><span>)</span></a>. In fact some uses of email consider the
               entire email service -- including Author and Recipient -- as a
               subordinate component. For these services "end-to-end" refers to
               points outside of the email service. Examples are voicemail over
               email <a class='info' href='#RFC3801'>[RFC3801]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vaudreuil, G. and G. Parsons, &ldquo;,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, EDI over email <a class='info' href='#RFC1767'>[RFC1767]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Crocker, D., &ldquo;MIME Encapsulation of EDI Objects,&rdquo; March&nbsp;1995.</span><span>)</span></a> and facsimile over email <a class='info' href='#RFC4142'>[RFC4142]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Crocker, D. and G. Klyne, &ldquo;Full-mode Fax Profile for Internet Mail: FFPIM,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Service Overview</h3>

<p><a name='anchor44'></a>End-to-end Internet Mail exchange is
               accomplished by using a standardized infrastructure comprising:
</p>
<p>
               </p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
                     </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>An email object
</li>
<li>Global addressing
</li>
<li>An asynchronous sequence of point-to-point transfer
                           mechanisms
</li>
<li>No prior arrangement between Author and Recipient
</li>
<li>No prior arrangement between point-to-point transfer
                           services, over the open Internet
</li>
<li>No requirement for Author and Recipient to be online
                           at the same time. 
</li>
</ul>
                  

</blockquote><p>
            
</p>
<p>The end-to-end portion of the service is the email object, called
               a message. Broadly the message, itself, distinguishes between
               control information for handling, versus the author's message
               content. 
</p>
<p>A precept to the design of mail over the open Internet is
               permitting user-to-user and MTA-to-MTA interoperability to take
               place with no prior, direct arrangement between the independent
               administrative authorities responsible for handling a message.
               That is, all participants rely on the
               core
               services being universally supported and accessible, either
               directly or through gateways that translate between Internet Mail
               and email environments that conform to other standards. Given the
               importance of spontaneity and serendipity in the world of human
               communications, this lack of prearrangement between participants
               is a core benefit of Internet Mail and remains a core requirement
               for it. 
</p>
<p>Within localized networks at the edge of the public Internet,
               prior administrative arrangement often is required and can
               include access control, routing constraints and information query
               service configuration. In recent years one change to local
               environments is an increased requirement for authentication or,
               at least, accountability. In these cases a server performs
               explicit validation of the client's identity.

Document Conventions</h3>

<p>In this document, references to structured fields of a message
               use a two-part dotted notation. The first part cites the document
               that contains the specification for the field and the second is
               the name of the field. Hence &lt;RFC2822.From&gt; is the
               From: field in an email content header and
               &lt;RFC2821.MailFrom&gt; is the address in the SMTP "Mail
               From" command.

<p>Many small editing changes, for wordsmithing improvements to make

</p>
<p>
               </p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Originator->Author:  </dt>
<dd> The term "Originator" is
                     used by RFC 2822 more broadly than just the From: field,
                     which specifically defines who the author of the content
                     is. I believe this distinguishes two constructs, one for
                     the content author and one for the first agency that
                     handles the message, in terms of the transfer service. So
                     the change from "Originator" to "Author" seems pretty
                     straightforward. The challenge is in using the term
                     Originator, as defined in RFC 2822 and applying it to the
                     system's architecture. 
</dd>
<dt>Source->Originator:  </dt>
<dd> This change is more of a
                     challenge. We need the "Originator" term and construct, but
                     the architecture is already complex enough. Hence, adding a
                     new construct seems like a very poor resolution. The
                     document has used "Source" as an MHS term for the MSA set
                     of functions. While one could argue against re-labeling it
                     as Originator, I believe this is a reasonable choice and
                     likely to be comfortable for community use, since "Source"
                     does not have an established history. 
</dd>
<dt>Bounce->Return:  </dt>
<dd>'bounce address' is not
                     accurate, because the address is used for more than that,
                     but it *is* as established term within portions of the
                     broader email community. I also believe the extensive
                     discussion on this point, last year, justifies the change.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>The problem with saying "Bounce" is that is not merely
                     linguistically impure, it is plain wrong and has already
                     caused serious problems. Witness SPF. Frankly, we need to
                     fix RFC2821, but that's a separate battle to fight and not
                     one for this forum.
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd>Although not a verbatim use of "Reverse Path", the related
                     term that seems to work publicly is "Return Address". It is
                     already established in the bricks-and-mortar postal world
                     and seems to have some acceptance within parts of the email
                     community. (I've done a draft white paper on authentication
                     for the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group and the
                     membership had some debate about this vocabulary choice and
                     converged on agreeing to it.)
</dd>
<dt>Is the envelope part of the message?</dt>
<dd>I don't
                     remember whether we resolved this. For a variety of
                     reasons, I believe the message includes its envelope, and
                     am encouraged to find RFC2822upd says: 
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt></dt>
<dd>In the context of electronic mail, messages are
                           viewed as having an envelope and contents. The
                           envelope contains whatever information is needed to
                           accomplish transmission and delivery. (See
                           [I‑D.klensin‑rfc2821bis] (Klensin, J., “Simple Mail
                           Transfer Protocol,” November 2007.) for a discussion
                           of the envelope.) The contents comprise the object to
                           be delivered to the recipient. This specification
                           applies only to the format and some of the semantics
                           of message contents.

Responsible Actor Roles</h3>

<p>Internet Mail is a highly distributed service, with a variety of
            actors serving different roles. These divide into 3 basic types: 
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
                  </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>User
</li>
<li>Mail Handling Service (MHS)
</li>
<li>ADministrative Management Domain (ADMD)
</li>
</ul>
               

</blockquote><p>Although related to a technical architecture, the focus on
            Actors concerns participant responsibilities, rather than on
            functionality of modules. Hence the labels used are different than
            for classic email architecture diagrams.

User Actors</h3>

<p>Users are the sources and sinks of messages. They can be humans,
               organizations or processes. They can have an exchange that
               iterates and they can expand or contract the set of users
               participating in a set of exchanges. In Internet Mail there are
               three types of user-level Actors: 
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote class="text">
<p>
                     </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Authors
</li>
<li>Recipients
</li>
<li>Mediators
</li>
</ul>
                  

</blockquote><p>From the User-level perspective all mail transfer
               activities are performed by a monolithic Mail Handling Service
               (MHS), even though the actual service can be provided by many
               independent organizations. Users are customers of this unified
               service.

Mediator</h3>

<p>
                  <a name='anchor54'></a>
                  <a name='anchor55'></a> A Mediator receives,
                  aggregates, reformulates and redistributes messages as part of
                  a potentially-protracted, higher-level exchange among Users.
                  It is easy to confuse this user-level activity with the
                  underlying MHS transfer exchanges. However they serve very
                  different purposes and operate in very different ways.
                  Mediators are considered extensively in <a class='info' href='#Mediators'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mediators</span><span>)</span></a>. 
</p>
<p>When mail is delivered to a receiving mediator specified in
                  the RFC2821.RcptTo command, the MHS handles it the same way as
                  for any other Recipient. That is, the MHS only sees posting
                  and delivery sources and sinks and does not see (later)
                  re-posting as a continuation of a process. Hence when
                  submitting messages, the Mediator is an Author.

<p>The distinctive aspects of a Mediator are, therefore, above
                  the MHS. A Mediator preserves the Author information of the
                  message it reformulates, but may make meaningful changes to
                  the content. Hence the MHS sees a new message, but Users
                  receive a message that is interpreted as primarily being from
                  -- or, at least, initiated by -- the author of the original
                  message. The role of a Mediator permits distinct, active
                  creativity, rather than being limited to the more constrained
                  job of merely connecting together other participants. Hence it
                  is really the Mediator that is responsible for the new
                  message. 
</p>
<p>A Mediator's task can be complex and contingent, such
                  as
                  modifying and adding content or regulating which users are
                  allowed to participate and when. The popular example of this
                  role is a group mailing list. A sequence of Mediators may even
                  perform a series of formal steps, such as reviewing, modifying
                  and approving a purchase request. 
</p>
<p>Because a Mediator originates messages, it can also receive
                  replies. So a Mediator really is a full-fledged User.

Mail Handling Service (MHS) Actors</h3>
<a name='anchor57'></a><a name='anchor58'></a><a name='anchor59'></a><a name='anchor60'></a>
<p>The Mail Handling Service (MHS) has the task of performing a
               single, end-to-end transfer on behalf of the Author and reaching
               the Recipient address(es) specified in the original
               RFC2821.RcptTo commands. Mediated or protracted, iterative
               exchanges, such as those used for collaboration over time, are
               part of the User-level service, and are not part of this
               transfer-level Handling Service.

<p>The following figure depicts the relationships
                  among
                  transfer participants in Internet Mail. It shows the Source as
                  distinct from the Author, and Dest[ination] as distinct from
                  Recipient, although it is common for each pair to be the same
                  actor. Transfers typically entail one or more Relays. However
                  direct delivery from the Source to Destination is possible.
                  For intra-organization mail services, it is common to have
                  only one Relay.

Originator</h3>

<p><a name='anchor61'></a><a name='anchor62'></a>The Originator role is responsible
                  for ensuring that a message is valid for posting and then
                  submitting it to a Relay. Validity includes conformance with
                  Internet Mail standards, as well as with local operational
                  policies. The Originator can simply review the message for
                  conformance and reject it if there are errors, or it can
                  create some or all of the necessary information. 
</p>
<p>The Originator operates with dual "allegiance". It serves the
                  Author and often it is the same entity. However its role in
                  assuring validity means that it MUST also represent the local
                  operator of the MHS, that is, the local ADministrative
                  Management Domain (ADMD). 
</p>
<p>The Originator also has the responsibility for any
                  post-submission, Author-related administrative tasks
                  associated with message transmission and delivery. Notably
                  this pertains to error and delivery notices. Hence Source is

Relay</h3>

<p><a name='anchor63'></a><a name='anchor64'></a>A
                  mail Relay performs email transfer-service routing and
                  store-and-forward by (re-)transmitting the message on towards
                  its Recipient(s). A Relay can add trace information. However
                  it does not modify existing envelope information or the
                  message content semantics. It can modify message content
                  syntax, such as a change from binary to
                  text
                  transfer-encoding form, only as required to meet the
                  capabilities of the next hop in the MHS. 
</p>
<p>A set of Relays composes a Mail Handling Service (MHS)
                  network. This is above any underlying packet-switching network

                  user-level Mediators.

<p>In other words, interesting email scenarios can involve three

</blockquote><p> with the bottom-most usually being the Internet's IP
                  service. The most basic email scenarios involve Relays and
                  Switches. 
</p>
<p>Aborting a message transfer results in having the Relay become
                  an Author and sending an error message to the Return address.
                  The potential for looping is avoided by having this message,
                  itself, contain no Return address.

Gateway</h3>

<p>
                  <a name='anchor65'></a>
                  <a name='anchor66'></a> A Gateway is a hybrid
                  form of User and Relay that interconnects heterogeneous mail
                  services. Its purpose is simply to emulate a Relay and the
                  closer it comes to this, the better. However it operates at
                  the User level, because it MUST be able to modify message
                  content. 
</p>
<p>Differences between mail services can be as small as minor
                  syntax variations, but usually encompass significant, semantic
                  distinctions. One difference could have the concept of an
                  email address being a hierarchical,
                  machine-specific
                  address, versus having it be a flat, global name space.
                  Another difference could be between text-only content, versus
                  multi-media. Hence the Relay function in a Gateway offers
                  significant design challenges, to make the result be as
                  seamless as possible. The most significant challenge is in
                  ensuring the user-to-user functionality that matches syntax
                  and semantics of independent email standards suites. 
</p>
<p>The basic test of a Gateway's adequacy is, of course, whether
                  an Author on one side of a Gateway can send a useful message
                  to a Recipient on the other side, without requiring changes to
                  any of the components in the Author's or Recipient's mail
                  services, other than adding the Gateway. To each of these
                  otherwise independent services, the Gateway will appear to be
                  a "native" participant. However the ultimate test of a
                  Gateway's adequacy is whether the Author and Recipient can
                  sustain a dialogue. In particular can a Recipient's MUA
                  automatically formulate a valid Reply that will reach the
                  initial Author?

Administrative Actors</h3>

<p>Actors often are associated with different organizations, each
               with its own administrative authority. This operational
               independence, coupled with the need for interaction between
               groups, provides the motivation for distinguishing among <a name='anchor67'></a><a name='anchor68'></a>ADministrative Management Domains
               (ADMD). Each ADMD can have vastly different operating policies
               and trust-based decision-making. An obvious example is the
               distinction between mail that is exchanged within a single
               organization, versus mail that is exchanged between independent
               organizations. The rules for handling these two types of traffic
               tend to be quite different. That difference requires defining the
               boundaries of each, and this requires the ADMD construct. 
</p>
<p>Operation of Internet Mail services is apportioned to different
               providers (or operators). Each can be an independent ADMD. This
               independence of administrative decision-making defines boundaries
               that distinguish different portions of the Internet Mail service.
               Examples include an end-user operating their desktop client, a
               department operating a local Relay, an IT department operating an
               enterprise Relay and an ISP operating a public shared email
               service. These can be configured into many combinations of
               administrative and operational relationships, with each ADMD
               potentially having a complex arrangement of functional
               components. <a class='info' href='#ADMD'>Figure&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>ADMD Example</span><span>)</span></a> depicts relationships among
               ADMDs. The benefit of having the ADMD construct is to facilitate
               discussion about designs and operations that need to distinguish
               between "internal" issues and "external" ones. 
</p>
<p>The architectural impact of needing to have boundaries between
               ADMD's is discussed in <a class='info' href='#Tussle'>[Tussle]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clark, D., Wroclawski, J., Sollins, K., and R. Braden, &ldquo;Tussle in Cyberspace: Defining Tomorrow’s Internet,&rdquo; 2002.</span><span>)</span></a>. Most significant
               is that the entities communicating across ADMD boundaries will
               typically have an added burden to enforce organizational policies
               concerning "external" communications. At a more mundane level,
               routing mail between ADMDs can be an issue, such as needing to
               route mail for partners over specially-trusted paths.

<p>Note that Transit services are quite different from

<p>Edge networks can use proprietary email standards internally.
               However the distinction between Transit network and Edge network
               transfer services is primarily significant because it highlights
               the need for concern over interaction and protection between
               independent administrations. In particular this distinction calls
               for additional care in assessing transitions of responsibility,
               as well as the accountability and authorization relationships
               among participants in email transfer. 
</p>
<p>The interactions between functional components within an ADMD are
               subject to the policies of that domain. Policies can cover such
               things as:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Reliability
</li>
<li>Access control
</li>
<li>Accountability
</li>
<li>Content evaluation and modification
</li>
</ul><p> They can be implemented in different functional
               components, according to the needs of the ADMD. For example see
                  <a class='info' href='#RFC5068'>[RFC5068]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hutzler, C., Crocker, D., Resnick, P., Sanderson, R., and E. Allman, &ldquo;Email Submission Operations: Access and Accountability                   Requirements,&rdquo; Nov&nbsp;2007.</span><span>)</span></a>. 
</p>
<p>User, Edge and Transit services can be offered by providers that
               operate component services or sets of services. Further it is
               possible for one ADMD to host services for other ADMDs.

</blockquote><p> A mailbox is specified as an Internet Mail address
               &lt;addr-spec&gt;. It has two distinct parts, divided by
               an at-sign ("@"). The right-hand side is a globally interpreted
               domain name that is associated with an ADMD. Domain Names are
               discussed in <a class='info' href='#DNS'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Domain Names</span><span>)</span></a>. Formal Internet Mail
               addressing syntax can support source routes, to indicate the path
               through which a message should be sent. Although legal, the use
               of source routes is not part of the modern Internet Mail service
               and it is not discussed further. 
</p>
<p>The portion to the left of the at-sign contains a string that is
               globally opaque and is called the &lt;local-part&gt;. It
               is to be interpreted only by the entity specified by the
               address's right-hand side domain name. All other entities MUST
               treat the local-part as a uninterpreted literal string and MUST
               preserve all of its original details. As such its public
               distribution is equivalent to sending a Web browser "cookie" that
               is only interpreted upon being returned to its Author.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.1.1.&nbsp;
Global Standards for Local-Part</h3>

<p>It is common for sites to have local structuring conventions
                  for the left-hand side &lt;local-part&gt; of an
                  &lt;addr-spec&gt;. This permits sub-addressing, such
                  as for distinguishing different discussion groups used by the
                  same participant. However it is worth stressing that these
                  conventions are strictly private to the user's organization
                  and SHOULD NOT be interpreted by any domain except the one
                  listed in the right-hand side of the addr-spec. The exceptions
                  are those specialized services conforming to standardized
                  conventions, as noted below. 
</p>
<p>There are a few types of addresses that have an elaboration on
                  basic email addressing, with a standardized, global schema for
                  the local-part. These are conventions between authoring
                  systems and Recipient Gateways, and they are invisible to the
                  public email transfer infrastructure. When an Author is
                  explicitly sending via a Gateway out of the Internet, there
                  are coding conventions for the local-part, so that the Author
                  can formulate instructions for the Gateway. Standardized
                  examples of this are the telephone numbering formats for VPIM
                     <a class='info' href='#RFC3801'>[RFC3801]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Vaudreuil, G. and G. Parsons, &ldquo;,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, such as

Scope of Email Address Use</h3>

<p>Email addresses are being used far beyond their original email
                  transfer and delivery role. In practical terms, an email
                  address string has become the common identifier for
                  representing online identity. What is essential, then, is to
                  be clear about the nature and role of an identity string in a
                  particular context and to be clear about the entity
                  responsible for setting that string. For example, see: <a class='info' href='#identref'>Section&nbsp;4.1.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Identity References in a Message</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#mda'>Section&nbsp;4.3.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#Mediators'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mediators</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2"></a><h3>3.2.&nbsp;
Domain Names</h3>

<p>A domain name is a global reference to an Internet resource, such
               as a host, a service or a network. A domain name usually maps to
               one or more IP Addresses. Conceptually the name might encompass
               an entire organization, a collection of machines integrated into
               a homogeneous service, or only a single machine. A domain name
               can be administered to refer to individual users, but this is not
               common practice. The name is structured as a hierarchical
               sequence of sub-names, separated by dots ("."), with the top of
               the hierarchy being on the right-end of the sequence. Domain
               names are defined and operated through the Domain Name System
               (DNS) <a class='info' href='#RFC1034'>[RFC1034]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain names -                   concepts and facilities,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC1035'>[RFC1035]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain                   names - implementation and specification,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC2181'>[RFC2181]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Elz, R. and R. Bush, &ldquo;Clarifications to the DNS                   Specification,&rdquo; July&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>. 
</p>
<p>When not part of a mailbox address, a domain name is used in
               Internet Mail to refer to the ADMD or the host that took action
               upon the message, such as providing the administrative scope for
               a message identifier, or performing transfer processing.

Message Identifier</h3>

<p>There are two standardized tags for identifying
               messages:
               Message-ID and ENVID.
</p>
<a name="msgid"></a><br /><hr />
<table summary="layout" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" class="TOCbug" align="right"><tr><td class="TOCbug"><a href="#toc">&nbsp;TOC&nbsp;</a></td></tr></table>
<a name="rfc.section.3.3.1"></a><h3>3.3.1.&nbsp;
Message-ID</h3>

<p> The Message-ID is a user-level tag, primarily used for
                  threading and for eliminating duplicates <a class='info' href='#RFC2822'>[RFC2822]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Resnick, P., &ldquo;Internet Message Format,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>. Any actor within the Originating ADMD
                  can assign the Message-ID. The recipient's ADMD is the
                  intended consumer of the Message-ID, although any actor along
                  the transfer path might use it. Internet Mail standards
                  provide for a single Message-ID; however more than one is
                  sometimes assigned. 
</p>
<p>Like a mailbox address, a Message-ID has two distinct parts,
                  divided by an at-sign ("@"). The right-hand side is globally
                  interpreted and specifies the ADMD or host assigning the
                  identifier. The left-hand side contains a string that is
                  globally opaque and serves to uniquely identify the message
                  within the domain referenced on the right-hand side. The
                  duration of uniqueness for the message identifier is
                  undefined. 
</p>
<p>When a message is revised in any way, the question of whether
                  to assign a new Message-ID requires a subjective assessment,
                  deciding whether the editorial content has been changed enough
                  to constitute a new message. <a class='info' href='#RFC2822'>[RFC2822]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Resnick, P., &ldquo;Internet Message Format,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> says "a
                  message identifier pertains to exactly one instantiation of a
                  particular message; subsequent revisions to the message each
                  receive new message identifiers." However real-world
                  experience dictates some flexibility. An impossible test is
                  whether the recipient will consider the new message to be
                  equivalent to the old. For most components of Internet Mail,
                  there is no way to predict a specific recipient's preferences
                  on this matter. Both creating and failing to create a new
                  Message-ID have their downsides. 
</p>
<p> The best that can be offered, here, are some guidelines and
                  examples: 
</p>

                  </p>
<blockquote class="text">

                        </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>If a message is changed only in terms of form,
                              such as character-encoding, it clearly is still
                              the same message. 
</li>
<li>If a message has minor additions to the content,
                              such as a mailing list tag at the beginning of the
                              RFC2822.Subject header field, or some mailing list
                              administrative information added to the end of the
                              primary body-part's text, then it probably is
                              still the same message. 
</li>
<li>If a message has viruses deleted from it, it
                              probably is still the same message. 
</li>
<li>If a message has offensive words deleted from it,
                              then some recipients will consider it the same
                              message, but some will not. 
</li>
<li>If a message is translated into a different
                              language, then some recipients will consider it
                              the same message, but some will not. 
</li>
<li>If a message is included in a digest of messages,
                              it the digest constitutes a new message.
</li>
<li> If a message is forwarded by a recipient, what is
                              forwarded is considered to be a new message.
</li>
<li>If a message is "redirected", such as using
                              RFC2822 "Redirect-*" headers, some recipients will
                              consider it the same message, but some will
                           not.
</li>
</ul>
                     

</blockquote><p>
               
</p>
<p>The absence of objective, precise criteria for Message-ID
                  re-generation, along with the absence of strong protection
                  associated with the string, means that the presence of an ID
                  can permit an assessment that is marginally better than a
                  heuristic, but the ID certainly has no value on its own for
                  strict formal reference or comparison. Hence Message-ID SHOULD
                  NOT be used for any function that has security implications.

ENVID</h3>

<p>The ENVID (envelope identifier) is a tag that is primarily for
                  use within Delivery Status Notifications (DSN), so that the
                  Return Address (RFC2821.MailFrom) recipient can correlate the
                  DSN with a particular message <a class='info' href='#RFC3461'>[RFC3461]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Moore, K., &ldquo;Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Service Extension for                   Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs),&rdquo; January&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a>. The
                  ENVID is therefore used from one message posting, until the
                  directly-resulting message deliveries. It does not survive
                  re-postings. 
</p>
<p>The ENVID may also be used for message tracking purposes <a class='info' href='#RFC3885'>[RFC3885]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Allman, E. and T. Hansen, &ldquo;SMTP Service Extension for Message Tracking,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>. 
</p>
<p>The format of an ENVID is free-form. Although its creator
                  might choose to impose structure on the string, none is
                  imposed by Internet standards. By implication, the scope of
                  the string is defined by the domain name of the Return
                  Address.

Message Data</h3>

<p>The purpose of the Mail Handling Service (MHS) is to exchange a
               message object among participants <a class='info' href='#RFC2822'>[RFC2822]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Resnick, P., &ldquo;Internet Message Format,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>,

               are merely in the service of getting that message from its Author
               to its Recipients. A message can be explicitly labeled as to its

</p>
<p>A message comprises a transit handling envelope and the message
               content. The envelope contains information used by the MHS. The
               content is divided into a structured header and the body. The
               header comprises transit trace information and end-user
               structured fields. The body may be unstructured simple lines of
               text, or it may be a MIME tree of multi-media subordinate

Envelope</h3>

<p>Internet Mail has a fragmented framework for transit-related
                  "handling" information. Information that is directly used by
                  the MHS is called the "envelope". It directs handling
                  activities by the transfer service as is carried in transfer
                  service commands. That is, the envelope exists in
                  the transfer protocol SMTP

Header Fields</h3>

<p>Header fields are attribute name/value pairs covering an
                  extensible range of email service, user content and user
                  transaction meta-information. The core set of header fields is
                  defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC2822'>[RFC2822]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Resnick, P., &ldquo;Internet Message Format,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>, <a class='info' href='#RFC0822'>[RFC0822]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Crocker, D., &ldquo;Standard                   for the format of ARPA Internet text messages,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1982.</span><span>)</span></a>. It is common to extend this set, for different
                  applications. Procedures for registering header fields are
                  defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC4021'>[RFC4021]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Klyne, G. and J. Palme, &ldquo;Registration of Mail and MIME Header Fields,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. An extensive set of

</p>
<p>One danger with placing additional information in header
                  fields is that Gateways often alter or delete them.

                        see no indication that any BCCs were sent, whereas the

User-Level Services</h3>

<p>Interactions at the user level entail protocol exchanges,
               distinct from those that occur at lower layers of the Internet
               Mail architecture, which is above the Internet Transport layer.
               Because the motivation for email, and much of its use, is for
               interaction among humans, the nature and details of these
               protocol exchanges often are determined by the needs of human and
               group communication. In terms of efforts to specify behaviors,
               one effect of this is to require subjective guidelines, rather
               than strict rules, for some aspects of system behavior. Mailing
               Lists provide particularly salient examples of this.

Mail User Agent (MUA)</h3>

<p>A Mail User Agent (MUA) works on behalf of end-users and
                  end-user applications. It is their "representative" within the
                  email service. 
</p>
<p>The Origination-side MUA (oMUA) creates a message and performs
                  initial "submission" into the transfer infrastructure, via a
                  Mail Submission Agent (MSA). It can also perform any creation-
                  and posting-time archival in its Message Store (oMS). An MUA's
                  oMS will typically include a folder for messages under
                  development (Drafts), a folder for messages waiting to be sent
                  (Queued or Unsent) and a folder for messages that have been
                  successfully posted for transmission (Sent). 
</p>
<p>The Recipient-side MUA (rMUA) works on behalf of the end-user
                  Recipient to process received mail. This includes generating
                  user-level return control messages, displaying and disposing
                  of the received message, and closing or expanding the user
                  communication loop, by initiating replies and forwarding new
                  messages.

Mail Submission Agent (MSA)</h3>

<p>A Mail Submission Agent (MSA) accepts the message submission
                  from the oMUA and enforces the policies of the hosting ADMD
                  and the requirements of Internet standards. An MSA represents
                  an unusual functional dichotomy. A portion of its task is to
                  represent MUA (uMSA) interests during message posting, to
                  facilitate posting success, and another portion is to
                  represent MHS (hMSA) interests. This is best modeled, as shown
                  in <a class='info' href='#Protocols'>Figure&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Protocols and Services</span><span>)</span></a>, with two sub-components, one
                  for the oMUA (oMSA) and one for the MHS (hMSA)
</p>
<p>The hMSA's function is to take transit responsibility for a
                  message that conforms to the relevant Internet standards and
                  to local site policies. It rejects messages that are not in
                  conformance. The oMSA's is to perform final message
                  preparation for submission and to effect the transfer of
                  responsibility to the MHS, via the hMSA. The amount of
                  preparation will depend upon the local implementations.
                  Examples of oMSA tasks could be to add header fields, such as
                  Date: and Message-ID, to modify portions of the message from
                  local notations to Internet standards, such as expanding an
                  address to its formal RFC2822 representation.

Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)</h3>

<p>A Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) relays mail for one
                  application-level "hop". It is like a packet-switch or IP
                  router in that its job is to make routing assessments and to
                  move the message closer to the Recipient(s). Relaying is
                  performed by a sequence of MTAs, until the message reaches a
                  destination MDA. Hence an MTA implements both client and
                  server MTA functionality. It does not make changes to
                  addresses in the envelope or reformulate the editorial
                  content. Hence a change in data form, such as to the MIME
                  Content-Transfer-Encoding, is within the purview of an MTA,
                  whereas removal or replacement of body content is not. Also it
                  can add trace information. Of course email objects are
                  typically much larger than the payload of a packet or
                  datagram, and the end-to-end latencies are typically much
                  higher. 
</p>
<p>Internet Mail primarily uses SMTP <a class='info' href='#RFC2821'>[RFC2821]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Klensin, J., &ldquo;Simple Mail Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>,
                     <a class='info' href='#RFC0821'>[RFC0821]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Postel, J., &ldquo;Simple Mail Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1982.</span><span>)</span></a> to effect point-to-point
                  transfers between peer MTAs. Other transfer mechanisms include
                  Batch SMTP <a class='info' href='#RFC2442'>[RFC2442]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;The Batch SMTP Media Type,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> and ODMR <a class='info' href='#RFC2645'>[RFC2645]<span> (</span><span class='info'>, &ldquo;On-Demand Mail Relay (ODMR) SMTP with Dynamic IP Addresses,&rdquo; August&nbsp;1999.</span><span>)</span></a>. As with most network layer mechanisms,
                  Internet Mail's SMTP supports a basic level of reliability, by
                  virtue of providing for retransmission after a temporary
                  transfer failure. Contrary to typical packet switches (and
                  Instant Messaging services) Internet Mail MTAs typically store
                  messages in a manner that allows recovery across service
                  interruptions, such as host system shutdown. However the
                  degree of such robustness and persistence by an MTA can be
                  highly variable. 
</p>
<p>The primary "routing" mechanism for Internet Mail is the DNS
                  MX record <a class='info' href='#RFC1035'>[RFC1035]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain                   names - implementation and specification,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a>, which specifies a host
                  through which the queried domain can be reached. This presumes
                  a public -- or at least a common -- backbone that permits any
                  attached host to connect to any other.

Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)</h3>

<p>A Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) delivers email to the Recipient's
                  mailbox. It can provide distinctive, address-based
                  functionality, made possible by its detailed knowledge of the
                  properties of the destination address. This knowledge might
                  also be present elsewhere in the Recipient's ADMD, such as at
                  an organizational border (Boundary) Relay. However it is
                  required for the MDA, if only because the MDA must know where
                  to deliver the message. 
</p>
<p>As with an MSA, an MDA serves two roles, as depicted in <a class='info' href='#Protocols'>Figure&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Protocols and Services</span><span>)</span></a>. Formal transfer of responsibility,
                  called "delivery" is effected between the two components that
                  embody these roles. The MHS portion (hMDA) primarily functions
                  as a server SMTP engine. A common additional role is to
                  re-direct the message to an alternative address, as specified
                  by the recipient addressee's preferences. The job of the
                  recipient portion of the MDA (rMDA) is to perform any
                  delivery-actions are desired by the recipient. 
</p>
<p>Using Internet protocols, delivery can be effected by a
                  variety of standard protocols. When coupled with an internal
                  local mechanism, SMTP <a class='info' href='#RFC2821'>[RFC2821]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Klensin, J., &ldquo;Simple Mail Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> and LMTP <a class='info' href='#RFC2033'>[RFC2033]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Myers, J., &ldquo;Local Mail Transfer Protocol,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> permit "push" delivery to the Recipient
                  system, at the initiative of the upstream email service. POP
                     <a class='info' href='#RFC1939'>[RFC1939]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Myers, J. and M. Rose, &ldquo;Post Office Protocol - Version 3,&rdquo; May&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> and IMAP <a class='info' href='#RFC3501'>[RFC3501]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Crispin, M., &ldquo;Internet Message Access Protocol - Version 4rev1,&rdquo; March&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> are used for "pull" delivery at the initiative of the
                  Recipient system. POP and IMAP can also be used for repeated
                  access to messages on a remote MS.

Mediators</h3>

<p>Basic email transfer from an Author to the specified Recipients is
            accomplished by using an asynchronous, store-and-forward
            communication infrastructure, in a sequence of independent
            transmissions through some number of MTAs. A very different task is
            a User-level sequence of postings and deliveries, through Mediators.
            A Mediator forwards a message, through a re-posting process. The
            Mediator does share some functionality with basic MTA relaying, but
            it enjoys a degree of freedom with both addressing and content that
            is not available to MTAs.

</blockquote><p> The salient aspect of a Mediator, that distinguishes it from

            preserves the integrity and tone of the original message, including
            the essential aspects of its origination information. The Mediator
            might also add commentary.

                        The new message is viewed as being from the Actor doing

                        modify the original message content. The forwarded
                        message is therefore independent of the original message
                        exchange and creates a new message dialogue. However the
                        final Recipient sees the contained message as from the

Aliasing</h3>

<p>Aliasing is a simple re-addressing facility that is available in
               most MDA implementations. It is performed just before placing a
               message into the specified Recipient's mailbox. Instead the
               message is submitted back to the transfer service, for delivery
               to one or more alternate addresses. Although typically
               implemented as part of an MDA, this facility is strictly a
               Recipient user function. It resubmits the message, replacing the
               envelope address, on behalf of the mailbox address that was
               listed in the envelope. 
</p>
<p>What is most distinctive about this forwarding mechanism is how
               closely it compares to normal MTA store-and-forward Relaying. Its
               only interesting difference is that it changes the RFC2821.RcptTo
               value. Having the change be this small makes it easy to view
               aliasing as a part of the lower-level mail relaying activity.
               However the small change has a large semantic impact: The
               designated recipient has chosen a new recipient. Hence that
               original recipient SHOULD become responsible for any handling
               issues. This change would be reflected by replacing the message's
               RFC2821.MailFrom address to be one within the scope of the ADMD
               doing the aliasing. 
</p>
<p>An MDA that is re-posting a message to an alias typically changes
               only envelope information:

Re-Sending</h3>

<p>Also called Re-Directing, Re-Sending differs from Forwarding by
               virtue of having the Mediator "splice" a message's addressing
               information, to connect the Author of the original message and
               the Recipient of the new message. This permits them to have
               direct exchange, using their normal MUA Reply functions. Hence
               the new Recipient sees the message as being From: the original
               Author, even if the Mediator adds commentary.

Mailing Lists</h3>

<p>Mailing lists have explicit email addresses and they re-post
               messages to a list of subscribed members. The Mailing List Actor
               performs a task that can be viewed as an elaboration of the
               Re-Director role. In addition to sending the new message to a
               potentially large number of new Recipients, the Mediator can
               modify content, such as deleting attachments, converting the
               format, and adding list-specific comments. In
               addition,
               archiving list messages is common. Still the message retains
               characteristics of being "from" the original Author. 
</p>
<p>Identities relevant to a mailing list processor, when submitting
               a message, include:

                           Received header fields or can choose to remove them.

Gateways</h3>

<p>A Gateway performs the basic routing and transfer work of message
               relaying, but it also may make any content, structure, address,
               or attribute modifications needed to send the message into a
               messaging environment that operates according to different
               standards or potentially incompatible policies. When a Gateway
               connects two differing messaging services, its role is easy to
               identify and understand. When it connects environments that have
               technical similarity, but can have significant administrative
               differences, it is easy to think that a Gateway is merely an MTA. 
</p>
<p>The critical distinction between an MTA and a Gateway is that the
               latter can make substantive changes to a message, in order to map
               between the standards of two, different messaging services. In
               virtually all cases, this mapping process results in some degree
               of semantic loss. The challenge of Gateway design is to minimize
               this loss. 
</p>
<p>A Gateway can set any identity field available to a regular MUA.
               Identities typically relevant to Gateways include:

Boundary Filter</h3>

<p>Organizations often enforce security boundaries by subjecting
               messages to analysis, for conformance with the organization's
               safety policies. An example is detection of content classed as
               spam or a virus. A Filter might alter the content, to render it
               safe, such as by removing content deemed unacceptable. Typically
               these actions will result in the addition of content that records
               the actions.

               service. In addition, email transfer protocols can operate over
               authenticated and/or encrypted links, and message content or
               authorship can be authenticated or encrypted.
