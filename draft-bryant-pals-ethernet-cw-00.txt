                Use of Ethernet Control Word RECOMMENDED
                    draft-bryant-pals-ethernet-cw-00

Abstract

   The pseudowire (PW) encapsulation of Ethernet, as defined in RFC4448,
   specifies that the use of the control word (CW) is optional.  In the
   absence of the CW an Ethernet pseudowire packet can be misidentified
   as an IP packet by a label switching router (LSR).  This in turn may
   lead to the selection of the wrong equal-cost-multi-path (ECMP) path
   for the packet, leading in turn to the mis-ordering of packets.  This
   problem has become more serious due to the deployment of equipment
   with Ethernet MAC addresses that start with 0x4 or 0x6.  The use of
   the Ethernet PW CW addresses this problem.  This document recommends
   the use of the Ethernet pseudowire control word in all but
   exceptional circumstances.

   This document updates RFC4448.

1.  Introduction

   The pseudowire(PW) encapsulation of Ethernet, as defined in RFC4448,
   specifies that the use of the control word (CW) is optional.  It is
   common for label switching routers (LSRs) to search past the end of
   the label stack to determine whether the payload is an IP packet, and
   if the payload is an IP packet, to select the next hop based of the
   so called "five-tuple" (IP source address, IP destination address,
   protocol/next-header, transport layer source port and transport layer
   destination port).  In the absence of a PW CW an Ethernet pseudowire
   packet can be misidentified as an IP packet by a label switching
   router (LSR) selecting the ECMP path based on the five-tuple.  This
   in turn may lead to the selection of the wrong equal-cost-multi-path
   (ECMP) path for the packet, leading in turn to the mis-ordering of
   packets.  Further discussion of this topic is published in [RFC4928].

   Flow misordering can also happen in a single path scenario when
   traffic classification and differential forwarding treatment
   mechanisms Section 6 are in use.

   This problem has become more serious due to the deployment of
   equipment with Ethernet MAC addresses that start with 0x4 or 0x6.
   The use of the Ethernet PW CW addresses this problem.

   This document recommends the use of the Ethernet pseudowire control
   word in all but exceptional circumstances.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Background

   Ethernet pseudowire encapsulation is specified in [RFC4448].  In
   particular the reader is drawn to section 4.6, part of which is
   quoted below for the convenience of the reader:

       "The control word defined in this section is based on the Generic
       PW MPLS Control Word as defined in [RFC4385].  It provides the
       ability to sequence individual frames on the PW, avoidance of
       equal-cost multiple-path load-balancing (ECMP) [RFC2992], and
       Operations and Management (OAM) mechanisms including VCCV
       [RFC5085].

       "[RFC4385] states, "If a PW is sensitive to packet misordering
       and is being carried over an MPLS PSN that uses the contents
       of the MPLS payload to select the ECMP path, it MUST employ a
       mechanism which prevents packet misordering." This is necessary
       because ECMP implementations may examine the first nibble after
       the MPLS label stack to determine whether the labeled packet
       is IP or not.  Thus, if the source MAC address of an Ethernet
       frame carried over the PW without a control word present begins
       with 0x4 or 0x6, it could be mistaken for an IPv4 or IPv6
       packet.  This could, depending on the configuration and
       topology of the MPLS network, lead to a situation where all
       packets for a given PW do not follow the same path.  This may
       increase out-of-order frames on a given PW, or cause OAM packets
       to follow a different path than actual traffic (see
       Section 4.4.3, "Frame Ordering").

       "The features that the control word provides may not be needed
       for a given Ethernet PW.  For example, ECMP may not be present
       or active on a given MPLS network, strict frame sequencing may
       not be required, etc.  If this is the case, the control word
       provides little value and is therefore optional.  Early Ethernet
       PW implementations have been deployed that do not include a
       control word or the ability to process one if present.  To
       aid in backwards compatibility, future implementations MUST
       be able to send and receive frames without the control word
       present."

   At the time when pseudowires were first deployed, some equipment of
   commercial significance was unable to process the Ethernet Control
   Word.  In addition, at that time it was considered that no Ethernet
   MAC address had been issued by the IEEE Registration Authority
   Committee (RAC) that starts with 0x4 or 0x6, and thus it was thought
   to be safe to deploy Ethernet PWs without the CW.

   Since that time the RAC has issued Ethernet MAC addresses start with
   0x4 or 0x6 and thus the assumption that in practical networks there
   would be no confusion between an Ethernet PW packet without the CW
   and an IP packet is no longer correct.

   Possibly through the use of unauthorized Ethernet MAC addresses, this
   assumption has been unsafe for a while, leading some equipment

   vendors to implement more complex, proprietary, methods to
   discriminate between Ethernet PW packets and IP packets.  Such
   mechanisms rely on the heuristics of examining the transit packets in
   trying to find out the exact payload type of the packet and cannot be
   reliable due to the random nature of the payload carried within such
   packets.

   A recent posting on the Nanog email list has highlighted this
   problem:

   https://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2016-December/089395.html

   RFC EDITOR Please delete this paragraph.
   Kramdown does not include references when they are only found in
   literal text so I include them here: [RFC4385] [RFC2992] [RFC5085] as
   a fixup.

4.  Recommendation

   The ambiguity between an MPLS payload that is a Ethernet PW and one
   that is an IP packet is resolved when the Ethernet PW control word is
   used.  This document updates RFC4448 [RFC4448] to state that where
   both both the ingress PE and the egress PE support the Ethernet
   pseudowire control word, then the CW MUST be used.

5.  Equal Cost Multi-path (ECMP)

   Where the volume of traffic on an Ethernet PW is such that ECMP is
   required then one of two methods may be used:

   o Flow-Aware Transport (FAT) of Pseudowires over an MPLS Packet
   Switched Network specified in [RFC6391], or

   o LSP entropy labels specified [RFC6790]

   RFC6391 works by increasing the entropy of the bottom of stack label.
   It requires that both the ingress and egress provider edge (PE)s
   support this feature.  It also requires that sufficient LSRs on the
   LSP between the ingress and egress PE be able to select an
   ECMP path on an MPLS packet with the resultant stack depth.

   RFC6790 works by including an entropy value in the LSP part of the
   label stack.  This requires that the Ingress and Egress PEs support
   the insertion and removal of the entropy label (EL) and the entropy
   label indicator, and that sufficient LSRs on the LSP are able to
   preform ECMP based on the EL.

Internet-Draft           Ethernet CW RECOMMENDED                May 2017


   In both cases there considerations in getting Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) packets to follow the same path
   as a data packet.  This is described in detail section 7 of
   [RFC6391], and section 6 of RFC6790.  However in both cases the
   situation is improved compared to the ECMP behavior in the case where
   the Ethernet PW CW was not used, since there is currently no known
   method of getting a PW OAM packet to follow the same path as a PW
   data packet subjected to ECMP based on the five tuple of the IP
   payload.

6.  Differential Treatment of Traffic Flows

   A description of this will be provided in a future version.

7.  Mitigations

   Where it is not possible to use the Ethernet PW CW, the effects of
   ECMP can be disabled by carrying the PW over a traffic engineered
   path that does not subject the payload to load balancing (for example
   [RFC3209].  However such paths may be subjected to link bundle load
   balancing and of course the single LSP has to carry the full PW load.

8.  Operational Considerations

   CW presence on the PW is controlled by the configuration and may be
   subject to default operational mode of not being enabled.  Care needs
   to be taken to ensure that software that implements this
   recommendation does not depend on existing configuration setting that
   prevents the use of control word.  It is recommended that platform
   software emits a rate limited message indicating that CW can be used
   but is disabled due to existing configuration.

9.  Security Considerations

   This document expresses a preference for one existing and widely
   deployed Ethernet PW encapsulation over another.  These methods have
   identical security considerations, which are discussed in [RFC4448].
   This document introduces no additional security issues.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no IANA requests.
