                   draft-byrne-opsec-udp-advisory-00


Abstract

   User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is commonly used as a volumetric attack
   transport on the internet.  Some network operators experience surges
   of UDP attack traffic that are multiple orders of magnitude above the
   baseline traffic rate for UDP.  Application developers should be
   advised that UDP is being rate-limited on a bits-per-second and
   packet-per-second basis by network operators to enforce known good
   baseline traffic levels for UDP. UDP has been abused to such an
   extent that legitimate use may become collateral damage and
   application and protocol developers should avoid using UDP as a
   transport when possible.

INTERNET DRAFT   Advisory Guidelines for UDP Deployment    July 20, 2015


1  Introduction

   The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [RFC0768] provides a minimal,
   unreliable, best-effort, message-passing transport to applications
   and other protocols (such as tunnels) that desire to operate over UDP
   [I-D.draft-ietf-tsvwg-rfc5405bis]. Since UDP does not establish an
   end-to-end connection at the transport layer, it is possible to carry
   out a source IP address spoofed distributed reflective denial-of-
   service attack (DRDoS)[ROSSOW]. Large amplification attacks have
   happened for years on a daily basis and are having a widespread
   negative impact on the internet [US-CERT].

2  Threat from UDP

   Simplicity is the strength of UDP.  Simplicity is also UDP's
   weakness. UDP allows a single packet response from an application. 
   TCP [RFC793] and SCTP [RFC4960] operate differently. TCP has a three-
   way handshake and SCTP has a four-way handshake, and thus they verify
   the reverse path will accept the communication within the transport
   layer prior to the application layer engaging.  Since UDP does not do
   any of this handshaking in the transport layer, the applications are
   left to create their own procedure for responding to network
   communication initiation.  In the case of  SNMP, NTP, CHARGEN, and
   DNS, a single spoofed IP packet can generate a much larger response
   to an attack target in many deployments.  The result is that several
   of these UDP deployments covering millions of internet nodes allow an
   attacker to hide the true source of the attack and amplify the
   magnitude of the attack by reflecting off of widely deployed UDP
   services on the internet [ROSSOW].

3  Recommendations for Application and Protocol Developers

   1. Application and protocol developers should avoid using UDP.  The
      abuse of UDP for DRDoS on the internet has made UDP subject to
      aggressive filtering at the transport protocol level. 
   2. If UDP must be used, encapsulate it in IPsec [RFC4303] to avoid
      matching IP protocol 17 filters.
   3. In the case of WebRTC [I-D.draft-ietf-rtcweb-transports], TURN
      [RFC5766] should be used to concentrate and manage a known-good
      UDP flows.  It is also recommended that WebRTC evolve to support
      native SCTP transport.  
   4. In the case of QUIC [I-D.draft-tsvwg-quic-protocol] and other
      transport innovations, a new IANA assigned protocol number should
      be used to meaningful differentiates traffic from commonly abused
      UDP services.

4  Recommendations for Network Operators

   1. To prevent the spoofed reflection attacks, all network operators
      should implement anti-spoof address filtering [RFC2827].  This
      prevents the trigger of the DRDoS.
   2. Network operators should govern the types of systems that offer
      UDP services.  This stewardship of directly attached nodes limits
      the fleet of nodes offering UDP services that could be abused for
      DRDoS.
   3. Network operators should baseline and rate-limit UDP for bits-per-
      second and packets-per-second.  This effort acts as protection
      mechanism to prevent unexpected large UDP flows that are highly
      likely to be DRDoS from propagating across the internet.


3  Security Considerations

   The continued abuse of UDP is a material security threat to the
   availability of the internet.  While mitigating the threat at the
   node implementation level would be ideal, years of experience has
   demonstrated this is not broadly effective.  While improving overall
   network availability by limiting UDP, it is likely that several
   important protocols will be negatively impacted including DNS,
   DNSSEC, DTLS, SRTP, UDP encapsulated IPsec and others.

4  IANA Considerations

   None.
