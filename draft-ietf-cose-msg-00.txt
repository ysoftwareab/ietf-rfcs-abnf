Abstract

   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is data format designed
   for small code size and small message size.  There is a need for the
   ability to have the basic security services defined for this data
   format.  This document specifies how to do signatures, message
   authentication codes and encryption using this data format.

1.  Introduction

   There has been an increased focus on the small, constrained devices
   that make up the Internet of Things (IOT).  One of the standards that
   has come of of this process is the Concise Binary Object
   Representation (CBOR).  This standard extends the data model of the
   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) by allowing for binary data among
   other changes.  CBOR is being adopted by several of the IETF working
   groups dealing with the IOT world to do their encoding of data
   structures.  CBOR was designed specifically to be both small in terms
   of messages transport and implementation size.  A need exists to
   provide basic message security services for IOT and using CBOR as the
   message encoding format makes sense.

   The JOSE working group produced a set of documents
   [RFC7515][RFC7516][RFC7517][RFC7518] that defined how to perform
   encryption, signatures and message authentication (MAC) operations
   for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) documents and then to encode
   the results using the JSON format [RFC7159].  This document does the
   same work for use with the Concise Binary Object Representation
   (CBOR) [RFC7049] document format.  While there is a strong attempt to
   keep the flavor of the original JOSE documents, two considerations
   are taken into account:

   o  CBOR has capabilities that are not present in JSON and should be
      used.  One example of this is the fact that CBOR has a method of
      encoding binary directly without first converting it into a base64
      encoded string.

   o  The author did not always agree with some of the decisions made by
      the JOSE working group.  Many of these decisions have been re-
      examined, and where it seems to the author to be superior or
      simpler, replaced.

1.1.  Design changes from JOSE

   o  Define a top level message structure so that encrypted, signed and
      MAC-ed messages can easily identified and still have a consistent
      view.

   o  Signed messages separate the concept of protected and unprotected
      attributes that are for the content and the signature.

Internet-Draft         CBOR Encoded Message Syntax             July 2015


   o  Key management has been made to be more uniform.  All key
      management techniques are represented as a recipient rather than
      only have some of them be so.

   o  MAC messages are separated from signed messages.

   o  MAC messages have the ability to do key management on the MAC
      authentication key.

   o  Use binary encodings for binary data rather than base64url
      encodings.

   o  Combine the authentication tag for encryption algorithms with the
      ciphertext.

   o  Remove the flattened mode of encoding.  Forcing the use of an
      array of recipients at all times forces the message size to be two
      bytes larger, but one gets a corresponding decrease in the
      implementation size that should compensate for this.  [CREF1]

1.2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   When the words appear in lower case, their natural language meaning
   is used.

1.3.  CBOR Grammar

   There currently is no standard CBOR grammar available for use by
   specifications.  In this document, we use the grammar defined in the
   CBOR data definition language (CDDL)
   [I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl].

   CDDL productions that together define the grammar are interspersed in
   the document like this:


   start = COSE_MSG

   Note that, fromthe XML version of the present document, the collected
   CDDL can be extracted via the following XPath expression:


   //artwork[@type='CDDL']/text()

Internet-Draft         CBOR Encoded Message Syntax             July 2015


   NOTE: At some point we need to make some decisions about how we are
   using CDDL in this document.  Since this draft has not been moving
   forward at a great rate, changing all references on it to
   informational is a good idea.  On the other hand, having some type of
   syntax that can be examined by a machine to do syntax checking is a
   big win.  The build system for this draft is currently using the
   latest version of CDDL to check that the syntax of the examples is
   correct.  Doing this has found problems in both the syntax checker,
   the syntax and the examples.

1.4.  CBOR Related Terminology

   In JSON, maps are called objects and only have one kind of map key: a
   string.  In COSE, we use both strings and integers (both positive and
   negative integers) as map keys, as well as data items to identify
   specific choices.  The (positive and negative) integers are used for
   compactness of encoding and easy comparison.  Since the work "key" is
   mainly used in its other meaning, as a cryptographic key, we use the
   term "label" for this usage of either an integer or a string to
   identify map keys and choice data items.


   label = int / tstr

2.  The COSE_MSG structure

   The COSE_MSG structure is a top level CBOR object which corresponds
   to the DataContent type in the Cryptographic Message Syntax
   (CMS)[RFC5652].  This structure allows for a top level message to be
   sent which could be any of the different security services.  The
   security service is identified within the message.

   The COSE_Tagged_MSG CBOR type takes the COSE_MSG and prepends a CBOR
   tag of TBD1 to the encoding of COSE_MSG.  By having both a tagged and
   untagged version of the COSE_MSG structure, it becomes easy to either
   use COSE_MSG as a top level object or embedded in another object.
   The tagged version allows for a method of placing the COSE_MSG
   structure into a choice, using a consistent tag value to determine
   that this is a COSE object.

   The existence of the COSE_MSG and COSE_Tagged_MSG CBOR data types are
   not intended to prevent protocols from using the individual security
   primitives directly.  Where only a single service is required, that
   structure can be used directly.

   Each of the top-level security objects use a CBOR map as the base
   structure.  Items in the map at the top level are identified by a

   label.  This document defines a number of labels in the IANA "COSE
   Object Labels Registry" (defined in Section 9.2).

   The set of labels present in a security object is not restricted to
   those defined in this document.  However, it is not recommended that
   additional fields be added to a structure unless this is going to be
   done in a closed environment.  When new fields need to be added, it
   is recommended that a new message type be created so that processing
   of the field can be ensured.  Using an older structure with a new
   field means that any security properties of the new field will not be
   enforced.  Before a new field is added at the outer level, strong
   consideration needs to be given to defining a new header field and
   placing it into the protected headers.  Applications should make a
   determination if non-standardized fields are going to be permitted.
   It is suggested that libraries allow for an option to fail parsing if
   non-standardized fields exist, this is especially true if they do not
   allow for access to the fields in other ways.

   A field 'msg_type' is defined to distinguish between the different
   structures when they appear as part of a COSE_MSG object.  [CREF2]
   [CREF3] This field is indexed by an integer value 1, the values
   defined in this document are:

      0 - Reserved.

      1 - Signed Message.

      2 - Encrypted Message

      3 - Authenticated Message (MAC-ed message)

   Implementations MUST be prepared to find an integer under this label
   which does not correspond to the values 1 to 3.  If this is found
   then the client MUST stop attempting to parse the structure and fail.
   The value of 0 is reserved and not to be used.  If the value of 0 is
   found, then clients MUST fail processing the structure.
   Implementations need to recognize that the set of values might be
   extended at a later date, but they should not provide a security
   service based on guesses of what is there.

   NOTE: Is the any reason to allow for a marker of a COSE_Key structure
   and all it to be a COSE_MSG, doing so does allow for a security risk,
   but may simplify the code.  [CREF4]

   The CDDL grammar that corresponds to the above is:

   COSE_MSG = COSE_Sign /
       COSE_encrypt /
       COSE_mac

   COSE_Tagged_MSG = #6.999(COSE_MSG)   ; Replace 999 with TBD1

   ; msg_type values
   reserved=0
   msg_type_signed=1
   msg_type_encrypted=2
   msg_type_mac=3


   The top level of each of the COSE message structures are encoded as
   maps.  We use an integer to distinguish between the different
   security message types.  By searching for the integer under the label
   identified by msg_type (which is in turn an integer), one can
   determine which security message is being used and thus what syntax
   is for the rest of the elements in the map.

3.  Header Parameters

   The structure of COSE has been designed to have two buckets of
   information that are not considered to be part of the payload itself,
   but are used for holding information about algorithms, keys, or
   evaluation hints for the processing of the layer.  These two buckets
   are available for use in all of the structures in this document
   except for keys.  While these buckets can be present, they may not
   all be usable in all instances.  For example, while the protected
   bucket is present for recipient structures, most of the algorithms
   that are used for recipients do not provide the necessary
   functionality to provide the needed protection and thus the element
   is not used.

   Both buckets are implemented as CBOR maps.  The map key is a 'label'
   Section 1.4.  The value portion is dependent on the definition for
   the label.  Both maps use the same set of label/value pairs.  The
   integer range for labels has been divided into several sections with
   a standard range, a private range, and a range that is dependent on
   the algorithm selected.  The tables of labels can be found in
   Table 2.

   Two buckets are provided for each layer: [CREF5]

   protected  contains attributes about the layer which are to be
      cryptographically protected.  This bucket MUST NOT be used if it
      is not going to be included in a cryptographic computation.

   unprotected  contains attributes about the layer which are not
      cryptographically protected.

   Both of the buckets are optional and are omitted if there are no
   items contained in the map.  The CDDL fragment which describes the
   two buckets is:

   header_map = {+ label => any }

   Headers = (
       ? protected => bstr,
       ? unprotected => header_map
   )

3.1.  COSE Headers

   The set of header fields defined in this document are:

   alg  This field is used to indicate the algorithm used for the
      security processing.  This field MUST be present at each level of
      a signed, encrypted or authenticated message.  This field using
      the integer '1' for the label.  The value is taken from the 'COSE
      Algorithm Registry' (see Section 9.4).

   crit  This field is used to ensure that applications will take
      appropriate action based on the values found.  This field uses the
      integer '2' for the label.  The value is an array of COSE Header
      Labels.  The field is used to indicate which protected header keys
      an application which is processing a message is required to
      understand.

         Integer keys in the range of 0 to 10 SHOULD be omitted.

         Integer keys in the range -1 to -255 can be omitted as they are
         algorithm dependent.  If an application can correctly process
         an algorithm, it can be assumed that it will correctly process
         all of the parameters associated with that algorithm.

      The header values indicated by 'crit' can be processed by either
      the security library code or by an application using a security
      library, the only requirement is that the field is processed.

   cty  This field is used to indicate the content type of the data in
      the payload or ciphertext fields.  The field uses the integer of
      '3' for the key value.  The value can be either an integer or a
      string.  Integers are from the XXXXX[CREF6] IANA registry table.
      Strings are from the IANA 'mime-content types' registry.
      Applications SHOULD provide this field if the content structure is
      potentially ambiguous.

      checked to find the correct one.  This field uses the integer
      value of '4' for the key value.  The value of field is the CBOR
      'bstr' type.  The internal structure of 'kid' is not defined and
      generally cannot be relied on by applications.

   This table contains a list of all of the parameters for use in
   signature and encryption message types defined by the JOSE document
   set.  In the table is the data value type to be used for CBOR as well
   as the integer value that can be used as a replacement for the name
   in order to further decrease the size of the sent item.

                           Table 2: Header Keys

   OPEN ISSUES:

   1.  Which of the following items do we want to have standardized in
       this document: jku, jwk, x5c, x5t, x5t#S256, x5u, zip

   2.  I am currently torn on the question "Should epk and iv/nonce be
       algorithm specific or generic headers?"  They are really specific
       to an algorithm and can potentially be defined in different ways

       for different algorithms.  As an example, it would make sense to
       defined nonce for CCM and GCM modes that can have the leading
       zero bytes stripped, while for other algorithms this might be
       undesirable.

   3.  We might want to define some additional items.  What are they?  A
       possible example would be a sequence number as this might be
       common.  On the other hand, this is the type of things that is
       frequently used as the nonce in some places and thus should not
       be used in the same way.  Other items might be challenge/response
       fields for freshness as these are likely to be common.

4.  Signing Structure

   The signature structure allows for one or more signatures to be
   applied to a message payload.  There are provisions for attributes
   about the content and attributes about the signature to be carried
   along with the signature itself.  These attributes may be
   authenticated by the signature, or just present.  Examples of
   attributes about the content would be the type of content, when the
   content was created, and who created the content.  Examples of
   attributes about the signature would be the algorithm and key used to
   create the signature, when the signature was created, and counter-
   signatures.

   When more than one signature is present, the successful validation of
   one signature associated with a given signer is usually treated as a
   successful signature by that signer.  However, there are some
   application environments where other rules are needed.  An
   application that employs a rule other than one valid signature for
   each signer must specify those rules.  Also, where simple matching of
   the signer identifier is not sufficient to determine whether the
   signatures were generated by the same signer, the application
   specification must describe how to determine which signatures were
   generated by the same signer.  Support of different communities of
   recipients is the primary reason that signers choose to include more
   than one signature.  For example, the COSE_Sign structure might
   include signatures generated with the RSA signature algorithm and
   with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature
   algorithm.  This allows recipients to verify the signature associated
   with one algorithm or the other.  (The original source of this text
   is [RFC5652].)  More detailed information on multiple signature
   evaluation can be found in [RFC5752].

   The CDDL grammar for a signature message is:

Internet-Draft         CBOR Encoded Message Syntax             July 2015


   COSE_Sign = {
       msg_type => msg_type_signed,
       Headers,
       ? payload => bstr,
       signatures => [+ COSE_signature]
   }

   The fields is the structure have the following semantics:

   msg_type  identifies this as providing the signed security service.
      The value MUST be msg_type_signed (1).

   protected  contains attributes about the payload which are to be
      protected by the signature.  An example of such an attribute would
      be the content type ('cty') attribute.  The content is a CBOR map
      of attributes which is encoded to a byte stream.  This field MUST
      NOT contain attributes about the signature, even if those
      attributes are common across multiple signatures.  The labels in
      this map are typically taken from Table 2.

   unprotected  contains attributes about the payload which are not
      protected by the signature.  An example of such an attribute would
      be the content type ('cty') attribute.  This field MUST NOT
      contain attributes about a signature, even if the attributes are
      common across multiple signatures.  The labels in this map are
      typically taken from Table 2.

   payload  contains the serialized content to be signed.
      If the payload is not present in the message, the application is
      required to supply the payload separately.
      The payload is wrapped in a bstr to ensure that it is transported
      without changes, if the payload is transported separately it is
      the responsibility of the application to ensure that it will be
      transported without changes.

   signatures  is an array of signature items.  Each of these items uses
      the COSE_signature structure for its representation.

   We use the values in Table 1 as the labels in the COSE_Sign map.
   While other labels can be present in the map, it is not generally a
   recommended practice.  The other labels can be either of integer or
   string type, use of other types SHOULD be treated as an error.

   The CDDL grammar structure for a signature is:

Internet-Draft         CBOR Encoded Message Syntax             July 2015


   COSE_signature =  {
       Headers,
       signature => bstr
   }

   The fields in the structure have the following semantics:

   protected  contains additional information to be authenticated by the
      signature.  The field holds data about the signature operation.
      The field MUST NOT hold attributes about the payload being signed.
      The content is a CBOR map of attributes which is encoded to a byte
      stream.  At least one of protected and unprotected MUST be
      present.

   unprotected  contains attributes about the signature which are not
      protected by the signature.  This field MUST NOT contain
      attributes about the payload being signed.  At least one of
      protected and unprotected MUST be present.

   signature  contains the computed signature value.

   The COSE structure used to create the byte stream to be signed uses
   the following CDDL grammar structure:

   Sig_structure = [
       body_protected: bstr,
       sign_protected: bstr,
       payload: bstr
   ]

   How to compute a signature:

   1.  Create a Sig_structure object and populate it with the
       appropriate fields.  For body_protected and sign_protected, if
       the fields are not present in their corresponding maps, an bstr
       of length zero is used.

   2.  Create the value ToBeSigned by encoding the Sig_structure to a
       byte string.

   3.  Call the signature creation algorithm passing in K (the key to
       sign with), alg (the algorithm to sign with) and ToBeSigned (the
       value to sign).

   4.  Place the resulting signature value in the 'signature' field of
       the map.

   How to verify a signature:

   1.  Create a Sig_structure object and populate it with the
       appropriate fields.  For body_protected and sign_protected, if
       the fields are not present in their corresponding maps, an bstr
       of length zero is used.

   2.  Create the value ToBeSigned by encoding the Sig_structure to a
       byte string.

   3.  Call the signature verification algorithm passing in K (the key
       to verify with), alg (the algorithm to sign with), ToBeSigned
       (the value to sign), and sig (the signature to be verified).

   In addition to performing the signature verification, one must also
   perform the appropriate checks to ensure that the key is correctly
   paired with the signing identity and that the appropriated
   authorization is done.

5.  Encryption object

   In this section we describe the structure and methods to be used when
   doing an encryption in COSE.  In COSE, we use the same techniques and
   structures for encrypting both the plain text and the keys used to
   protect the text.  This is different from the approach used by both
   [RFC5652] and [RFC7516] where different structures are used for the
   plain text and for the different key management techniques.

   One of the byproducts of using the same technique for encrypting and
   encoding both the content and the keys using the various key
   management techniques, is a requirement that all of the key
   management techniques use an Authenticated Encryption (AE) algorithm.
   (For the purpose of this document we use a slightly loose definition
   of AE algorithms.)  When encrypting the plain text, it is normal to
   use an Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD)
   algorithm.  For key management, either AE or AEAD algorithms can be
   used.  See Appendix A for more details about the different types of
   algorithms.  [CREF7]

   The CDDL grammar structure for encryption is:

   COSE_encrypt = {
       msg_type=>msg_type_encrypted,
       COSE_encrypt_fields
   }

   COSE_encrypt_fields = (
       Headers,
       ? ciphertext => bstr,
       ? recipients => [+{COSE_encrypt_fields}]
   )

   Description of the fields:

   msg_type  identifies this as providing the encrypted security
      service.  The value MUST be msg_type_encrypted (2).

   protected  contains the information about the plain text or
      encryption process that is to be integrity protected.  The field
      is encoded in CBOR as a 'bstr'.  The contents of the protected
      field is a CBOR map of the protected data names and values.  The
      map is CBOR encoded before placing it into the bstr.  Only values
      associated with the current cipher text are to be placed in this
      location even if the value would apply to multiple recipient
      structures.

   unprotected  contains information about the plain text that is not
      integrity protected.  Only values associated with the current
      cipher text are to be placed in this location even if the value
      would apply to multiple recipient structures.

   cipherText  contains the encrypted plain text.  If the cipherText is
      to be transported independently of the control information about
      the encryption process (i.e. detached content) then the field is
      omitted.

   recipients  contains the recipient information.  It is required that
      at least one recipient MUST be present for the content encryption
      layer.

5.1.  Key Management Methods

   There are a number of different key management methods that can be
   used in the COSE encryption system.  In this section we will discuss
   each of the key management methods and what fields need to be
   specified to deal with each of them.

   The names of the key management methods used here are the same as are
   defined in [RFC7517].  Other specifications use different terms for



Schaad                   Expires January 6, 2016               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft         CBOR Encoded Message Syntax             July 2015


   the key management methods or do not support some of the key
   management methods.

   At the moment we do not have any key management methods that allow
   for the use of protected headers.  This may be changed in the future
   if, for example, the AES-GCM Key wrap method defined in [RFC7518]
   were extended to allow for authenticated data.  In that event the use
   of the 'protected' field, which is current forbidden below, would be
   permitted.

5.1.1.  Direct Encryption

   In direct encryption mode, a shared secret between the sender and the
   recipient is used as the CEK.  When direct encryption mode is used,
   it MUST be the only mode used on the message.  It is a massive
   security leak to have both direct encryption and a different key
   management mode on the same message.

   For JOSE, direct encryption key management is the only key management
   method allowed for doing MAC-ed messages.  In COSE, all of the key
   management methods can be used for MAC-ed messages.

   The COSE_encrypt structure for the recipient is organized as follows:

   o  The 'protected', 'ciphertext' and 'recipients' fields MUST be
      absent.

   o  At a minimum, the 'unprotected' field MUST contain the 'alg'
      parameter and SHOULD contain a parameter identifying the shared
      secret.

5.1.2.  Key Wrapping

   In key wrapping mode, the CEK is randomly generated and that key is
   then encrypted by a shared secret between the sender and the
   recipient.  All of the currently defined key wrapping algorithms for
   JOSE (and thus for COSE) are AE algorithms.  Key wrapping mode is
   considered to be superior to direct encryption if the system has any
   capability for doing random key generation.  This is because the
   shared key is used to wrap random data rather than data has some
   degree of organization and may in fact be repeating the same content.

   The COSE_encrypt structure for the recipient is organized as follows:

   o  The 'protected', and 'recipients' fields MUST be absent.

   o  The plain text to be encrypted is the key from next layer down
      (usually the content layer).



Schaad                   Expires January 6, 2016               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft         CBOR Encoded Message Syntax             July 2015


   o  At a minimum, the 'unprotected' field MUST contain the 'alg'
      parameter and SHOULD contain a parameter identifying the shared
      secret.

5.1.3.  Key Encryption

   Key Encryption mode is also called key transport mode in some
   standards.  Key Encryption mode differs from Key Wrap mode in that it
   uses an asymmetric encryption algorithm rather than a symmetric
   encryption algorithm to protect the key.  The only current Key
   Encryption mode algorithm supported is RSAES-OAEP.

   The COSE_encrypt structure for the recipient is organized as follows:

   o  The 'protected' field MUST be absent.

   o  The plain text to be encrypted is the key from next layer down
      (usually the content layer).

   o  At a minimum, the 'unprotected' field MUST contain the 'alg'
      parameter and SHOULD contain a parameter identifying the
      asymmetric key.

5.1.4.  Direct Key Agreement

   Direct Key Agreement derives the CEK from the shared secret computed
   by the key agreement operation.

   When direct key agreement mode is used, it SHOULD be the only mode
   used on the message.  This method creates the CEK directly and that
   makes it difficult to mix with additional recipients.

   The COSE_encrypt structure for the recipient is organized as follows:

   o  The 'protected' field MUST be absent.

   o  At a minimum, the 'unprotected' field MUST contain the 'alg'
      parameter and SHOULD contain a parameter identifying the
      asymmetric key.

   o  The 'unprotected' field MUST contain the 'epk' parameter.

5.1.5.  Key Agreement with Key Wrapping

   Key Agreement with Key Wrapping uses a randomly generated CEK.  The
   CEK is then encrypted using a Key Wrapping algorithm and a key
   derived from the shared secret computed by the key agreement
   algorithm.

   The COSE_encrypt structure for the recipient is organized as follows:

   o  The 'protected' field MUST be absent.

   o  The plain text to be encrypted is the key from next layer down
      (usually the content layer).

   o  At a minimum, the 'unprotected' field MUST contain the 'alg'
      parameter, a parameter identifying the recipient asymmetric key,
      and a parameter with the sender's asymmetric public key.

5.2.  Encryption Algorithm for AEAD algorithms

   The encryption algorithm for AEAD algorithms is fairly simple.
   In order to get a consistent encoding of the data to be
   authenticated, the Enc_structure is used to have canonical form of
   the AAD.

   Enc_structure = [
       protected: bstr,
       external_aad: bstr
   ]


   1.  Copy the protected header field from the message to be sent.

   2.  If the application has supplied external additional authenticated
       data to be included in the computation, then it is placed in the
       'external_aad' field.  If no data was supplied, then a zero
       length binary value is used.

   3.  Encode the Enc_structure using a CBOR Canonical encoding
       Section 8 to get the AAD value.

   4.  Determine the encryption key.  This step is dependent on the key
       management method being used: For:

       No Recipients:  The key to be used is determined by the algorithm
          and key at the current level.

       Direct and Direct Key Agreement:  The key is determined by the
          key and algorithm in the recipient structure.  The encryption
          algorithm and size of the key to be used are inputs into the
          KDF used for the recipient.  (For direct, the KDF can be
          thought of as the identity operation.)

       Other:  The key is randomly generated.

   5.  Call the encryption algorithm with K (the encryption key to use),
       P (the plain text) and AAD (the additional authenticated data).
       Place the returned cipher text into the 'ciphertext' field of the
       structure.

   6.  For recipients of the message, recursively perform the encryption
       algorithm for that recipient using the encryption key as the
       plain text.

5.3.  Encryption algorithm for AE algorithms

   1.  Verify that the 'protected' field is absent.

   2.  Verify that there was no external additional authenticated data
       supplied for this operation.

   3.  Determine the encryption key.  This step is dependent on the key
       management method being used: For:

       No Recipients:  The key to be used is determined by the algorithm
          and key at the current level.

       Direct and Direct Key Agreement:  The key is determined by the
          key and algorithm in the recipient structure.  The encryption
          algorithm and size of the key to be used are inputs into the
          KDF used for the recipient.  (For direct, the KDF can be
          thought of as the identity operation.)

       Other:  The key is randomly generated.

   4.  Call the encryption algorithm with K (the encryption key to use)
       and the P (the plain text).  Place the returned cipher text into
       the 'ciphertext' field of the structure.

   5.  For recipients of the message, recursively perform the encryption
       algorithm for that recipient using the encryption key as the
       plain text.

6.  MAC objects

   In this section we describe the structure and methods to be used when
   doing MAC authentication in COSE.  JOSE used a variant of the
   signature structure for doing MAC operations and it is restricted to
   using a single pre-shared secret to do the authentication.  This
   document allows for the use of all of the same methods of key
   management as are allowed for encryption.

   When using MAC operations, there are two modes in which it can be
   used.  The first is just a check that the content has not been
   changed since the MAC was computed.  Any of the key management
   methods can be used for this purpose.  The second mode is to both
   check that the content has not been changed since the MAC was
   computed, and to use key management to verify who sent it.  The key
   management modes that support this are ones that either use a pre-
   shared secret, or do static-static key agreement.  In both of these
   cases the entity MAC-ing the message can be validated by a key
   binding.  (The binding of identity assumes that there are only two
   parties involved and you did not send the message yourself.)

   COSE_mac = {
      msg_type=>msg_type_mac,
      Headers,
      ? payload => bstr,
      tag => bstr,
      recipients => [+{COSE_encrypt_fields}]
   }


   Field descriptions:

   msg_type  identifies this as providing the encrypted security
      service.  The value MUST be msg_type_mac (3).

   protected  contains attributes about the payload which are to be
      protected by the MAC.  An example of such an attribute would be
      the content type ('cty') attribute.  The content is a CBOR map of
      attributes which is encoded to a byte stream.  This field MUST NOT
      contain attributes about the recipient, even if those attributes
      are common across multiple recipients.  At least one of protected
      and unprotected MUST be present.

   unprotected  contains attributes about the payload which are not
      protected by the MAC.  An example of such an attribute would be
      the content type ('cty') attribute.  This field MUST NOT contain
      attributes about a recipient, even if the attributes are common
      across multiple recipients.  At least one of protected and
      unprotected MUST be present.

   payload  contains the serialized content to be MAC-ed.
      If the payload is not present in the message, the application is
      required to supply the payload separately.
      The payload is wrapped in a bstr to ensure that it is transported
      without changes, if the payload is transported separately it is
      the responsibility of the application to ensure that it will be
      transported without changes.

   tag  contains the MAC value.

   recipients  contains the recipient information.  See the description
      under COSE_Encryption for more info.

    MAC_structure = [
        protected: bstr,
        external_aad: bstr,
        payload: bstr
   ]

   How to compute a MAC:

   1.  Create a MAC_structure and copy the protected and payload
       elements from the COSE_mac structure.

   2.  If the application has supplied external authenticated data,
       encode it as a binary value and place in the MAC_structure.  If
       there is no external authenticated data, then use a zero length
       'bstr'.

   3.  Encode the MAC_structure using a canonical CBOR encoder.  The
       resulting bytes is the value to compute the MAC on.

   4.  Compute the MAC and place the result in the 'tag' field of the
       COSE_mac structure.

   5.  Encrypt and encode the MAC key for each recipient of the message.

7.  Key Structure

   There are only a few changes between JOSE and COSE for how keys are
   formatted.  As with JOSE, COSE uses a map to contain the elements of
   a key.  Those values, which in JOSE, are base64url encoded because
   they are binary values, are encoded as bstr values in COSE.

   For COSE we use the same set of fields that were defined in
   [RFC7517].

   COSE_Key = {
       kty => tstr / int,
       ? key_ops => [+ tstr / int ],
       ? alg => tstr / int,
       ? kid => bstr,
       * keys => values
   }

   COSE_KeySet = [+COSE_Key]


   The element "kty" is a required element in a COSE_Key map.
   All other elements are optional and not all of the elements listed in
   [RFC7517] or [RFC7518] have been listed here even though they can all
   appear in a COSE_Key map.

   The "key_ops" element is preferred over the "use" element as the
   information provided that way is more finely detailed about the
   operations allowed.  It is strongly suggested that this element be
   present for all keys.

   The same fields defined in [RFC7517] are used here with the following
   changes in rules:

   o  Any item which is base64 encoded in JWK, is bstr encoded for COSE.

   o  Any item which is integer encoded in JWK, is int encoded for COSE.

   o  Any item which is string (but not base64) encoded in JWK, is tstr
      encoded for COSE.

   o  Exceptions to this are the following fields:

      kid  is always bstr encoded rather than tstr encoded.  This change
         in encoded is due to the fact that frequently, values such as a
         hash of the public key is used for a kid value.  Since the
         field is defined as not having a specific structure, making it
         binary rather than textual makes sense.

8.  CBOR Encoder Restrictions

   There as been an attempt to limit the number of places where the
   document needs to impose restrictions on how the CBOR Encoder needs
   to work.  We have managed to narrow it down to the following
   restrictions:

   o  The restriction applies to the encoding the Sig_structure, the
      Enc_structure, and the MAC_structure.

Internet-Draft         CBOR Encoded Message Syntax             July 2015


   o  The rules for Canonical CBOR (Section 3.9 of RFC 7049) MUST be
      used in these locations.  The main rule that needs to be enforced
      is that all lengths in these structures MUST be encoded such that
      they are encoded using definite lengths and the minimum length
      encoding is used.

   o  All parsers used SHOULD fail on both parsing and generation if the
      same label is used twice as a key for the same map.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  CBOR Tag assignment

   It is requested that IANA assign a new tag from the "Concise Binary
   Object Representation (CBOR) Tags" registry.  It is requested that
   the tag be assigned in the 0 to 23 value range.

   Tag Value: TBD1

   Data Item: CBOR map

   Semantics: COSE security message.

9.2.  COSE Object Labels Registry

   It is requested that IANA create a new registry entitled "COSE Object
   Labels Registry".  [CREF8]

   This table is initially populated by the table in Table 1.

9.3.  COSE Header Label Table

   It is requested that IANA create a new registry entitled "COSE Header
   Labels".

   The columns of the registry are:

   name  The name is present to make it easier to refer to and discuss
      the registration entry.  The value is not used in the protocol.
      Names are to be unique in the table.

   label  This is the value used for the label.  The label can be either
      an integer or a string.  Registration in the table is based on the
      value of the label requested.  Integer values between 0 and 255
      and strings of length 1 are designated as Standards Track Document
      required.  Integer values from 256 to 65535 and strings of length
      2 are designated as Specification Required.  Integer values of
      greater than 65535 and strings of length greater than 2 are

10.  Security Considerations

   There are security considerations:

   1.  Protect private keys

   2.  MAC messages with more than one recipient means one cannot figure
       out who sent the message

   3.  Use of direct key with other recipient structures hands the key
       to other recipients.

   4.  Use of direct ECDH direct encryption is easy for people to leak
       information on if there are other recipients in the message.

   5.  Considerations about protected vs unprotected header fields.

Appendix A.  AEAD and AE algorithms

   The set of encryption algorithms that can be used with this
   specification is restricted to authenticated encryption (AE) and
   authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) algorithms.
   This means that there is a strong check that the data decrypted by
   the recipient is the same as what was encrypted by the sender.
   Encryption modes such as counter have no check on this at all.  The
   CBC encryption mode had a weak check that the data is correct, given
   a random key and random data, the CBC padding check will pass one out
   of 256 times.  There have been several times that a normal encryption
   mode has been combined with an integrity check to provide a content
   encryption mode that does provide the necessary authentication.  AES-
   GCM [AES-GCM], AES-CCM [RFC3610], AES-CBC-HMAC

   [I-D.mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2] are examples of these composite
   modes.

   2PKCS v1.5 RSA key transport does not qualify as an AE algorithm.
   There are only three bytes in the encoding that can be checked as
   having decrypted correctly, the rest of the content can only be
   probabilistically checked as having decrypted correctly.  For this
   reason, PKCS v1.5 RSA key transport MUST NOT be used with this
   specification.  RSA-OAEP was designed to have the necessary checks
   that that content correctly decrypted and does qualify as an AE
   algorithm.

   When dealing with authenticated encryption algorithms, there is
   always some type of value that needs to be checked to see if the
   authentication level has passed.  This authentication value may be:

   o  A separately generated tag computed by both the encrypter and
      decrypter and then compared by the decryptor.  This tag value may
      be either placed at the end of the cipher text (the decision we
      made) or kept separately (the decision made by the JOSE working
      group).  This is the approach followed by AES-GCM [AES-GCM] and
      AES-CCM [RFC3610].

   o  A fixed value which is part of the encoded plain text.  This is
      the approach followed by the AES key wrap algorithm [RFC3394].

   o  A computed value is included as part of the encoded plain text.
      The computed value is then checked by the decryptor using the same
      computation path.  This is the approach followed by RSAES-OAEP
      [RFC3447].

Appendix B.  Three Levels of Recipient Information

   All of the currently defined Key Management methods only use two
   levels of the COSE_Encrypt structure.  The first level is the message
   content and the second level is the content key encryption.  However,
   if one uses a key management technique such as RSA-KEM (see
   Appendix A of RSA-KEM [RFC5990], then it make sense to have three
   levels of the COSE_Encrypt structure.

   These levels would be:

   o  Level 0: The content encryption level.  This level contains the
      payload of the message.

   o  Level 1: The encryption of the CEK by a KEK.

Internet-Draft         CBOR Encoded Message Syntax             July 2015


   o  Level 2: The encryption of a long random secret using an RSA key
      and a key derivation function to convert that secret into the KEK.

   This is an example of what a triple layer message would look like.
   The message has the following layers:

   o  Level 0: Has a content encrypted with AES-GCM using a 128-bit key.

   o  Level 1: Uses the AES Key wrap algorithm with a 128-bit key.

   o  Level 3: Uses ECDH Ephemeral-Static direct to generate the level 1
      key.

   In effect this example is a decomposed version of using the ECDH-
   ES+A128KW algorithm.

C.1.  Direct MAC

   This example has some features that are in questions but not yet
   incorporated in the document.

   To make it easier to read, this uses CBOR's diagnostic notation
   rather than a binary dump.

   This example is uses HMAC with SHA-256 as the digest algorithm.  The
   key management is uses two static ECDH keys along with HKDF to
   directly derive the key used in the HMAC operation.

C.2.  Wrapped MAC

   This example has some features that are in questions but not yet
   incorporated in the document.

   To make it easier to read, this uses CBOR's diagnostic notation
   rather than a binary dump.

   This example uses AES-128-MAC truncated to 64-bits as the digest
   algorithm.  It uses AES-256 Key wrap for the key management algorithm
   wrapping the 128-bit key used for the digest algorithm.

   This example has some features that are in questions but not yet
   incorporated in the document.

   To make it easier to read, this uses CBOR's diagnostic notation
   rather than a binary dump.

   This example uses HMAC with SHA-256 for the digest algorithm.  There
   are three different key management techniques applied:

   o  An ephemeral static ECDH key agreement operation using AES-128 key
      wrap on the digest key.

   o  Key transport using RSA-OAEP with SHA-256 for the hash and the mfg
      function operations.

   o  AES 256-bit Key wrap using a pre-shared secret.

   by the JOSE document set for a specific key type.  In the table is
   the data value type to be used for CBOR as well as the integer value
   that can be used as a replacement for the name in order to further
   decrease the size of the sent item.  Parameters dealing with keys

Editorial Comments

[CREF1] JLS: Need to check this list for correctness before publishing.

[CREF2] JLS: I have moved msg_type into the individual structures.
        However, they would not be necessary in the cases where a) the
        security service is known and b) security libraries can setup to
        take individual structures.  Should they be moved back to just
        appearing if used in a COSE_MSG rather than on the individual
        structure?

Internet-Draft         CBOR Encoded Message Syntax             July 2015


[CREF3] JLS: Should we create an IANA registries for the values of
        msg_type?

[CREF4] JLS: OPEN ISSUE

[CREF5] JLS: A completest version of this grammar would list the options
        available in the protected and unprotected headers.  Do we want
        to head that direction?

[CREF6] JLS: Need to figure out how we are going to go about creating
        this registry -or are we going to modify the current mime-
        content table?

[CREF7] Ilari: I don't follow/understand this text

[CREF8] JLS: Finish the registration process.

[CREF9] JLS: Should we register both or just the cose+cbor one?
