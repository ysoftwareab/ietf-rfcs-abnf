                Self describing data Node tag capability
            draft-tao-netconf-notif-node-tag-capabilities-03

Abstract

   Before a client application subscribes to updates from a datastore,
   server capabilities related to "Subscription to YANG Datastores" can
   be advertised using YANG Instance Data format.  These server
   capabilities can be documented at implement time or reported at run-
   time.

   This document proposes a YANG module for self describing data Object
   tag capability which augments system capabilities model and provide
   additional self describing data node attributes associated with node
   selectors within per-node capabilities.

1.  Introduction

   As described in [I-D.netconf-notification-capabilities], a server
   supporting YANG-Push MAY have a number of capabilities such as

   o  Supported (reporting) periods for periodic subscriptions;

   o  Maximum number of objects that can be sent in an update;

   o  Supported dampening periods for on-change subscriptions;

   o  The set of data nodes for which on-change notification is
      supported.

   Notification capability model defined in [I-D.netconf-notification-
   capabilities] allows a client to discover basic system capability and
   YANG-Push related capabilities both at implementation-time and run-
   time.  Without using this notification capability, it might lead to
   unexpected failures or additional message exchanges for NETCONF

   clients to discover data objects with specific capability supported
   by a NETCONF server.

   When all telemetry data on the server subscribed by a particular
   subscriber is huge, it becomes more likely that a burst of streamed
   data may temporarily overwhelm a receiver and consume expensive
   computing and storage resource.  Accordingly, there is a need for
   filtering subscribed telemetry data on a server based on server
   capabilities, which can greatly reduce the amount of data to be
   streamed out to the destination.

   However without telemetry data classification or prior knowledge of
   data objects correlation relationship, it is difficult for NETCONF
   clients to automatically select target data objects that are of
   interest to the client applications, e.g., identify a set of objects
   from different YANG data modules which have a common characteristic,
   collect specific object type nodes for multiple dimensional network
   visibility analysis.

   This document proposes a YANG module for self describing data Node
   tag capability which augments System Capabilities model and provide
   additional self describing data node tag attributes associated with
   node selector for queries filtering.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Self-explanation data Node tag capability

   The YANG module ietf-notification-capabilities defined in [I-
   D.netconf-notification-capabilities] specifies the following server
   capabilities related to YANG Push:

   o  A set of capabilities related to the amount of notifications the
      server can send out

   o  Specification of which data nodes support on-change notifications.

   o  Capability values can be specified on server level, datastore
      level or on specific data nodes (and their contained sub-tree) of
      a specific datastore.  Capability values on a smaller, more
      specific part of the server's data always override more generic
      values.

Internet-Draft            Node Tags Capability              October 2020


   o  On-change capability is not specified on a server level as
      different datastores usually have different on-change
      capabilities.  On a datastore level on-change capability for
      configuration and state data can be specified separately.

   These server capabilities can be provided either at implementation
   time or reported at run time.

   This document augments system capabilities model and provide
   additional data node self explaination tag attributes associated with
   node selector within per-node capabilities:

   o  Specification of which data objects (e.g., data object tagged with
      object tag, property subobject tag, metri subobject tag) they can
      push to the target recipient;

   o  Specification of metric group tag associated with a set of metric
      subobjects;

   o  Specfication of multi-source aggregation tag assocaited with
      specific metric subobject;

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive in some
   network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these
   data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /sysc:system-capabilities/sysc:datastore-capabilities/sysc:per-
      node-capabilities/sys:node-selection/sys:node-selector/sec:self-
      describing-attributes/sec:opm-tag

   o  /sysc:system-capabilities/sysc:datastore-capabilities/sysc:per-
      node-capabilities/sys:node-selection/sys:node-selector/sec:self-
      describing-attributes/sec:metric-group

   o  /sysc:system-capabilities/sysc:datastore-capabilities/sysc:per-
      node-capabilities/sys:node-selection/sys:node-selector/sec:self-
      describing-attributes/sec:multi-source-tag

   The publisher advertise telemetry data node capability to the
   subscriber to instruct the receiver to subscribe targeted data object
   with specific characteristics (e.g., performance metric related data
   object) and specific data path corresponding to the targeted data
   object.

   The following XML example [W3C.REC-xml-20081126] illustrates the
   advertisment of the list of available target objects:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

  <description>Defines the notification capabilities of an acme-router.
    The router only has running, and operational datastores.
    Every change can be reported on-change from running, but
    only config=true nodes and some config=false data from operational.
    Statistics are not reported based on timer based trigger and counter
    threshold based trigger.

   With telemetry data tagging information carried in the Telemetry data
   Tagging Advertisement, the subscriber identifies targeted data object
   and associated data path to the datastore node and sends a establish-
   subscription RPC to subscribe specific data objects that are
   interests to the client application from the publisher.

 <netconf:rpc message-id="101"
     xmlns:netconf="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
   <establish-subscription
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications"
       xmlns:yp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-push">
     <yp:datastore
          xmlns:ds="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-datastores">
       ds:operational
     </yp:datastore>
     <yp:datastore-xpath-filter
         xmlns:ex="https://example.com/sample-data/1.0">
       /if:interfaces/if:interface/if:statistics/if:in-errors
     </yp:datastore-xpath-filter>
     <yp:periodic>
       <yp:period>500</yp:period>
     </yp:periodic>
   </establish-subscription>
 </netconf:rpc>

   The publisher returns specific object type of operational state
   related to the subscriber.
