Abstract

   In LTE (Long Term Evolution) bearer network, there will be a large
   number of network elements and service tunnels which will bring a lot

   of configuration work. The cost will be very high if all these work
   is performed manually.

   In order to reduce the workload of configuration to minimum, the
   following questions should be considered:

   o How to establish the DCN (Data Communication Network) connections
      automatically to avoid making configuration locally?

   o How to establish the DCN connections automatically between
      different vendors' network elements or how to pass through
      different service providers' network?

   o How to get network element and link information of the real
      network based on the information from network planning?

   o How to generate configuration scripts to setup network and service
      links automatically in order to reduce configuration design
      workload.

   LTE is a typical scenario which involves large number of network
   elements and service tunnels. Other scenarios like IPTV may also have
   network configuration problems discussed in this document.

   This document discusses problems related to lightening network
   configuration workload and better transmission tunnel setup between
   network elements and NMS (Network Management System).

1. Introduction

   The mobile network will evolve to LTE obviously. In LTE phase, the
   number of base stations will be ten times more than 3G. Following

   this, constructing LTE network will take a lot of efforts due to the
   large numbers of base stations and bearer network elements. SON is
   considered in 3GPP to lighten this work [1]. To support SON, the
   bearer network should be setup first to provide required service
   links.

   Several issues of configuration in the existing network constructing
   should be considered:

   o It takes a lot of work to design the configuration scripts for the
      large amount of network elements, which will often bring
      occasional mistakes.

   o Some of the base station's address and links can not be acquired.
      So the network topology often changes from what is planned, and
      the pre-designed configuration scripts of the network elements
      need to be changed in network deployment phase.

   o Without DCN connection, the initial configuration scripts can only
      be input locally or use MODEM/CF cards, which involve large amount
      of manual work.

   o The manual work cannot avoid mistakes which will cause failure of
      network.

   This document provides two problem statements related to minimizing
   the network configuration workload.

3. Configuration problems

3.1. Configuration workload in LTE scenario

   In a typical LTE network scenario, there will be up to 16000 base
   stations, 20000 network elements and up to 200K service tunnels.

   In the existing configuration method, the configuration related work
   includes:

   o The engineer design of the configuration scripts of each element.

   o The arrival time of engineers to the place of network elements.

   o The engineer check of the network elements and links based on
      network planning.

   o Change of the configuration scripts by the engineer when network
      topology changes unexpectedly.

   o The configuration scripts input to the network elements.

   After network is configured and the network element is connected to
   NMS, the service tunnels can be configured from NMS. Configuring
   service tunnel from NMS is already defined which is not included in
   this problem statement.

   The workload of network configuration in this typical scenario is
   estimated and shown in figure 1.

   Figure 1 Workload of network configuration in LTE scenario

   The workload of arrival time of engineer to the network elements
   occupies 51% of total and configuration design of the device occupies
   33% of total. Instead of local operation, remote operation is
   valuable for device or link check and configuration input to avoid
   manual configuration in the locale. It is also very important to
   reduce the large workload of device design and temporary
   configuration change which takes 33% of all the workload and requires
   senior engineers. The auto configuration based on network topology
   and service model is important to be realized to reduce the
   workload of network configuration.

3.1.1. Remote configuration

   There are three questions to be solved for remote configuration:

   o It takes a lot of work to design the configuration scripts for the
      large amount of network elements, which will often bring
      occasional mistakes.

   o Some of the base station's address and links can not be acquired.
      So the network topology often changes from what is planned, and
      the pre-designed configuration scripts of the network elements
      need to be changed in network deployment phase.

   o Without DCN connection, the initial configuration scripts can only
      be input locally or use MODEM/CF cards, which involve large amount
      of manual work.

   The network elements usually connect to NMS by in-band NMS channel
   because the separate DCN is expensive. In the existing method, the
   engineer should make some configuration manually before the network
   elements connect to NMS. For example, the configuration may include
   creation of interfaces, IP address assignment of the interfaces and
   network elements, routing protocols enable on these interfaces and
   assignment of parameters for the routing protocols.

   After the above configuration is finished, the routing protocols will
   take effect. Following this, the in-band NMS connection will be setup
   which connects the network elements to NMS. To minimum the workload,
   manual configuration should be avoided.

   In addition, the network may be composed of different vendors' device,
   and the in-band NMS connection may pass through different service
   provider's network. How to setup in-band NMS connection which passes
   through different vendors' equipments and different service
   provider's network is also important.

   Before remote configuration, the engineer should check the real
   network topology which includes equipment and link information from
   network planning. The problem we should consider is how to get
   equipment and link information and sending to NMS.

3.1.2. Automatic generation of network configuration

   To reduce the workload of configuration scripts design by senior
   engineers, it is very important to generate network configuration
   automatically. Though there are many devices and service links in LTE

   network, the topology and the service type in access and aggregation
   network is simple.

   Some network planning tools can generate configuration scripts, but
   there are also many changes during network constructing which results
   in invalid scripts and the engineer should design it again. If the
   real network topology is available, e.g. equipment and link
   information, the configuration scripts for the real network'
   equipment can be generated, which will reduce the workload and avoid
   mistakes from manual configuration.

   The network elements needed for network design may include:

   o service type (e.g. L3 VPN/L2 VPN),

   o routing protocol (e.g. OSPF/ISIS) and,

   o IP addresses and etc.

   The topology elements may include:

   o Role of the device including name and type

   o Port of the device, i.e. connection

   o Connection of the device at user side and etc.


4. Security Considerations

   It is possible that there are security issues with the problems
   stated above, e.g. the tunnel between NMS and network elements needs
   mutual authentication before the tunnel is finally setup.

5. IANA Considerations

   None.
