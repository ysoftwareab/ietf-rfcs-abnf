            An X-IDNA Profile for Electronic Mail Addresses
                       draft-teint-xidna-email-00

Abstract

   Traditional mail systems handle only ASCII characters in SMTP
   envelope and mail header address fields.

   This memo defines an extension to allow Internationalised Email
   Adresses, the characters of which can be drawn from the large Unicode
   repertoire, based on the Extending IDNA to Other Protocols (X-IDNA)
   base specification.

Internet-Draft     X-IDNA Profile for Email Addresses         March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The X-IDNA base specification ([I-D.teint-xidna-base]) provides a
   generic framework for internationalisation of addresses, based on
   IDNA.  This memo defines an X-IDNA Profile for use with Netnews
   newsgroup names.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft     X-IDNA Profile for Email Addresses         March 2010


2.  Profile Definition

2.1.  Applicability

   This X-IDNA Profile applies to to email addresses defined in
   [RFC5321] and [RFC5322], i.e. to the following syntax elements:
   o  the "Mailbox" symbol defined in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC5321]
   o  the "addr-spec" symbol defined in Section 3.4.1 of [RFC5322]
   It also applies to other specifications based on these definitions
   (or their precedessors) if the elements are to be used as email
   addresses.

2.2.  Normalisation

   The exact steps for normalisation depend on the way the address is
   embedded in higher-level syntax elements.

2.2.1.  RFC 5321 Format Addresses

   Normalisation of email addresses from [RFC5321] follows the following
   procedure:
   o  In "Quoted-string", remove the quote character ("\") from all
      instances of "quoted-pairSMTP" the second character of which is a
      "ALPHA", "DIGIT", HYPHEN-MINUS (U+002D) or extended character
      (U+0080 and above).
   The definitions of "Quoted-string" and "qutoted-pairSMTP" are taken
   from Section 4.1.2 of [RFC5321].  The definition of "ALPHA" and
   "DIGIT" is from Section B.2 of [RFC4234].

2.2.2.  RFC 5322 Format Addresses

   Normalisation of email addresses from [RFC5322] follows the following
   procedure:
   o  In "quoted-string", "atom", "dot-atom" and "domain-literal",
      remove all instances of "FWS" that do not appear between
      "qcontent", "atext" or "dtext" elements and all instances of
      "CFWS".  Replace all other instances of "FWS" with a single "SP"
      (U+0020) character.

      Instead, an application MAY choose to treat them as opaque
      separators, which results in these elements bypassing the label
      validation and conversion.
   o  In "quoted-string" and "obs-dtext", remove the quote character
      ("\") from all instances of "quoted-pair" the second character of
      which is a "ALPHA", "DIGIT", HYPHEN-MINUS (U+002D) or extended
      character (U+0080 and above).
   The definition of "quoted-pair" is found in Section 3.2.1, the
   definitions of "FWS" and "CFWS" in Section 3.2.2, the definitions of

Internet-Draft     X-IDNA Profile for Email Addresses         March 2010


   "atom", "dot-atom" and "atext" in Section 3.2.3, the definitions of
   "quoted-string" and "qcontent" in Section 3.2.4, the definitions of
   "domain-literal" and "dtext" in Section 3.4.1 and the definition of
   "obs-dtext" in Section 4.4 of [RFC5322].  The definition of "ALPHA"
   and "DIGIT" is from Section B.2 of [RFC4234].

2.3.  Validation

   For the "domain" part of an email address, validation is already
   handled by the Registration Protocol described in Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-idnabis-protocol].

   Validation of the "local-part" is the responsibility of whoever
   defines the "local-part" for a specific domain.

   Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs, see [RFC5598]) MAY validate addresses
   read from a local configuration file and alert the operator if any
   invalid addresses are found.
   Other than that, Message Handling Service Actors (MHS Actors, see
   [RFC5598]) MUST NOT validate addresses.

3.  Relation to other Specifications

3.1.  Email Address Internationalisation

   Email Address Internationalisation (EAI), the framework of which is
   described in [RFC5336], provides an alternative approach to the
   internationalisation of email addresses, based on allowing UTF-8
   characters in SMTP envelopes and mail header fields.

   EAI and X-IDNA for Mail complement each other and are interoperable
   if the following rules are followed:
   1.  When defining email addresses, operators SHOULD follow the
       requirements of Section 2.3 in this specification as well as the
       syntax for "mailbox" defined in Section 4.4 of [RFC5335].
   2.  Message Handling Service Actors (MHS Actors, see [RFC5598]) MUST
       follow the rules laid out in Number 2 of Section 3.1 in
       [I-D.teint-xidna-base] when comparing addresses.  That is, UTF-8
       addresses (in EAI terms) or U-Addresses (in X-IDNA terms) and
       their equivalent A-Addresses must match.
   3.  In addition to Number 4 of Section in [RFC5336], an UTF8SMTP-
       aware server MAY also downgrade the message to an all-ASCII by
       converting the UTF-8 addresses (in EAI terms) or U-Addresses (in
       X-IDNA terms) to their A-Address counterparts.  In the context of
       EAI, this is known as "algorithmic downgrade".

       If ASCII addresses are available via the ALT-ADDRESS parameter,
       the downgrading server SHOULD always use this address.  That is,
       an ALT-ADDRESS parameter SHOULD take precedence over
       algorithmically determined A-Addresses.
   4.  Instead of the second method of MAILBOX Downgrading defined in
       Section 5.1.7 of [RFC5504], a server SHOULD rewrite an "Utf-8-
       addr-spec" in the absence of an corresponding "Addr-spec" as:
          [ Display-Name ] "<" A-Address ">"
       where "A-Address" is the ACE form of "Utf-8-addr-spec" (i.e.
       encoded according to this X-IDNA profile).

3.2.  Mailbox Names for Common Services

   Section 6 of [RFC2142] defines a required administrative mailbox name
   for mailing lists, which is constructed by adding the string
   "-REQUEST" to the local part.

   The use of "-" as a delimiter yields inconsistent results when the
   list address is an internationalised address.  Therefore, the
   requirement in Section 6 of [RFC2142] is amended as follows:

   For a mailing list the submission mailbox name of which is:

Internet-Draft     X-IDNA Profile for Email Addresses         March 2010


      <LIST@DOMAIN>
   where "LIST" contains an address that contains extended characters or
   A-Labels (starting with "xn--"), there MUST be an administrative
   mailbox name:
      <LIST+REQUEST@DOMAIN>
   (Note the use of "+" instead of "-".)

   In addition, there MAY be additional administrative mailbox names
   derived by:
      <A-LIST-REQUEST@DOMAIN>
      <U-LIST-REQUEST@DOMAIN>
   where "A-LIST" is the ACE form of "LIST", potentially yielding a fake
   A-Label "A-LIST-REQUEST", and where "U-LIST" is the Unicode form of
   "LIST", yielding a (usually) different ACE encoding when converted to
   ASCII.

   For a mailing list the submission mailbox name of which is:
      <LIST@DOMAIN>
   where "LIST" contains an address that does not contain extended
   characters or A-Labels, there MUST be an administrative mailbox name:
      <LIST-REQUEST@DOMAIN>
   In addition, there MAY be the an administrative mailbox name:
      <LIST+REQUEST@DOMAIN>

   Future specifications may phase out the form using "-" and make the
   form using "+" mandatory for all types of list addresses.

5.  Security Considerations

   For the "domain" part of an email address, the Security
   Considerations of [I-D.ietf-idnabis-defs] and [I-D.ietf-idnabis-bidi]
   apply directly.

   For the "local part" of an email address, the security issues may be
   less virulent if a central authority chooses email addresses for
   individual users.  However, if a domain allows public registration of
   email addresses, the local part is subject to the same Security
   Considerations as those for domain names.  Operators of such domains
   ought to adapt policies for local parts that are similar to those of
   domain registries.
