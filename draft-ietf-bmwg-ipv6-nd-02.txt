   This document is a benchmarking instantiation of RFC 6583:
   "Operational Neighbor Discovery Problems" [RFC6583].  It describes a
   general testing procedure and measurements that can be performed to
   evaluate how the problems described in RFC 6583 may impact the
   functionality or performance of intermediate nodes.

2.  Terminology

   Intermediate Node  A router, switch, firewall or any other device
      which separates end-nodes.  The tests in this document can be
      completed with any intermediate node which maintains a neighbor

      cache, although not all measurements and performance
      characteristics may apply.

   Neighbor Cache  See RFC 4861 [RFC4861]

   Neighbor Discovery  See Section of RFC 4861

   Scanner Network  The network from which the scanning tester is
      connected.

   Scanning Interface  The interface from which the scanning activity is
      initiated.

   Stale Entry Time  See RFC 4861

   Target Network  The network for which the scanning tests is targeted.

   Target Network Destination Interface  The interface that resides on
      the target network, which is primarily used to measure DUT
      performance while the scanning activity is occurring.

3.  Overview of Relevant NDP and Intermediate Node Behavior

   Network elements map IP addresses to link-layer addresses.  ARP
   [RFC0826] manages the mapping process for IPv4, while the Neighbor
   Discovery Protocol [RFC4861] manages mapping for IPv6.  With IPv6,
   when a node forwards a packet:

   1.  The node determines if the destination IPv6 address is present in
       its neighbor cache.

   2.  If the address is present in the neighbor cache, the node
       forwards the packet to the destination node using the appropriate
       link-layer address.

   3.  If the destination IPv6 address is not in the intermediate node's
       neighbor cache:

       1.  An entry for the IPv6 address is added to the neighbor cache
           and the entry is marked "INCOMPLETE".

       2.  The intermediate node sends an ICMP Neighbor Solicitation
           (NS) packet.

       3.  If an ICMP Neighbor Advertisement (NA) for the IPv6 address
           is received by the node, the neighbor cache entry is marked
           "REACHABLE" and remains in this state for 15 to 45 seconds.

Internet-Draft         draft-ietf-bmwg-ipv6-nd-01             April 2016


       4.  If a neighbor advertisement is not received, the intermediate
           node will continue sending NS packets every second until
           either an NA is received or the maximum number of
           solicitations has been sent.  If an NA is not received in
           this period, the entry can be discarded.

   There are two scenarios where a neighbor cache can grow to a very
   large size:

   1.  There are a large number of real nodes connected via an interface
       and a large number of these nodes are sending and receiving
       traffic simultaneously.

   2.  There are a large number of addresses for which a scanning
       activity is occurring and no real node will respond to the
       neighbor solicitation.  This scanning activity can be
       unintentional or malicious.  In addition to maintaining the
       "INCOMPLETE" neighbor cache entry, the intermediate node must
       send a NS packet every second for the maximum number of
       solicitations.

   A node's neighbor cache is of a finite size and can only accommodate
   a specific number of entries, which can be limited by available
   memory or a preset operating system limit.  If the maximum number of
   entries in a neighbor cache is reached, the intermediate node must
   either drop an existing entry to make space for the new entry or deny
   the new IP address to MAC address/ interface mapping with an entry in
   the neighbor cache.  In an extreme case, the intermediate node's
   memory may become exhausted, causing the intermediate node to crash
   or page memory.

   RFC 6583 [RFC6583] describes a how a port scan can cause neighbor
   cache exhaustion.

   Section 7.1 of RFC 6583 describes how nodes should behave when the
   neighbor cache is exhausted.  Section 6 of RFC 6583 [RFC6583]
   recommends how damage from an IPv6 address scan may be mitigated.
   Section 6.2 of RFC 6583 [RFC6583] discusses queue tuning.

4.  Test Setup

   The network has two subnets.  These connect the DUT to the scanning
   and target networks.

   It is assumed that the latency for all network segments is
   negligible.  By default, the target network's subnet shall be 64-bits
   in length, although some tests may involve increasing the prefix
   length.

   Although packet size shouldn't have a direct impact, packet per
   second (pps) rates will have an impact.  Smaller packet sizes should
   be utilized to facilitate higher packet per second rates.

   For purposes of this test, the packet type being sent by the scanning
   device isn't important, although most scanning applications might
   want to send packets that would elicit responses from nodes within a
   subnet (such as an ICMPv6 echo request).  Since it is not intended
   that responses be evoked from the target network node, such packets
   aren't necessary.

   At the beginning of each test the intermediate node should be
   initialized.  Minimally, the neighbor cache should be cleared.

   Basic format of test network.

+---------------+             +-----------+             +--------------+

4.1.  Testing Interfaces

   Two tester interfaces are configured for most tests:

   o  Scanning source (src) interface: This is the interface from which
      test packets are sourced.  This interface sources traffic to
      destination IPv6 addresses on the target network from a single
      link-local address, similar to how an adjacent intermediate node
      would transit traffic through the intermediate node.

   o  Target network destination (dst) interface: This interface
      responds to neighbor solicitations as appropriate and confirms
      when an intermediate node has forwarded a packet to the interface
      for consumption.  Where appropriate, the target network
      destination interface will respond to neighbor solicitations with
      a unique link-layer address per IPv6 address solicited.

5.  Modifiers (Variables)

5.1.  Frequency of NDP Triggering Packets

   The frequency of NDP triggering packets can be as high as the maximum
   packet per second rate that the scanner network will support (or is
   rated for).  However, it may not be necessary to send packets at a
   particularly high rate.  In fact, a non-benchmarking goal of testing

   could be to identify if the DUT is able to withstand scans at rates
   which otherwise would not impact the performance of the DUT.

   Optimistically, the scanning rate should be incremented until the
   DUT's performance begins deteriorating.  Depending on the software
   and system being used to implement the scanning, it may be
   challenging to achieve a sufficient rate.  Where this maximum
   threshold cannot be determined, the test results should note the
   highest rate tested and that DUT performance deterioration was not
   noticed at this rate.

   The lowest rate tested should be the rate for which packets can be
   expected to have an impact on the DUT -- this value is of course,
   subjective.

6.  Tests

6.1.  Stale Entry Time Determination

   This test determines the time interval when the intermediate node
   (DUT) identifies an address as stale.

   RFC 4861, section 6.3.2 [RFC4861] states that an address can be
   marked "stale" at a random value between 15 and 45 seconds (as
   defined via constants in the RFC).  This test confirms what value is
   being used by the intermediate node.  Note that RFC 4861 states that
   this random time can be changed "at least every few hours."

6.1.1.  General Testing Procedure

   1.  Send a packet from the scanning source interface to an address in
       target network.  Observe that the intermediate node sends a NS to
       the solicited-node multicast address on the target network, for
       which tester destination interface should respond with an NA.
       The intermediate node should create an entry in neighbor cache
       for the address, marking the address as "reachable".  As this
       point, the packet should be forwarded to the tester destination
       interface.

   2.  After the neighbor advertisement from the destination tester
       interface in step one, the tester will send no more NA messages

   3.  Continue sending packets from the scanning source interface to
       the same address in the target network.

   4.  Note the time at which the DUT no longer forwards packets.  The
       stale timer value will be the period of time between when the DUT
       received the first neighbor advertisement above and the point at

Internet-Draft         draft-ietf-bmwg-ipv6-nd-01             April 2016


       which the DUT no longer forwards packets for this flow to the
       tester destination interface.

6.2.  Neighbor Cache Exhaustion Determination

   Discover the point at which the neighbor cache is exhausted and
   evaluate intermediate node behavior when this threshold is reached.
   If the stale timer is configurable, it should be set to its maximum
   value.. A side-effect of this test is to confirm that intermediate
   node behaves correctly; in particular, it shouldn't crash.

   Note that some intermediate nodes may restrict the frequency of
   allowed neighbor discovery packets transmitted.  The maximum allowed
   packets per second must either be set to a value which doesn't impact
   the outcome of the test must allow for this restriction.

6.2.1.  General Testing Procedure

   1.  At a very fast rate, send packets incrementally to valid unique
       addresses in the target network, within stale entry time period.
       Simultaneously, send packets for addresses previously added to
       the neighbor cache.  The neighbor cache has been exhausted when
       previously added addresses must be re-discovered with a neighbor
       solicitation (within the stale entry time period).

   2.  Observe what happens when one address greater than the maximum
       neighbor cache size ("n") is reached.  When "n+1" is reached, if
       either the first or most recent cache entry are dropped, this may
       be acceptable.

   3.  Confirm intermediate node doesn't crash when "n+1" is reached.

6.3.  Preference For Previously Discovered Neighbors

   Determine whether the DUT prefers previously discovered neighbors.

6.3.1.  General Testing Procedures

   Repeat the test describe . However, in this test, the test device
   withholds the NA message for odd numbered IP addresses.  At the end
   of the test, only even numbered IP addresses should appear in the
   neighbor cache.

7.  Measurements Explicitly Excluded

   These are measurements which aren't recommended because of the
   itemized reasons below:

7.1.  DUT CPU Utilization

   This measurement relies on the DUT to provide utilization
   information, which is subjective.

7.2.  Malformed Packets

   This benchmarking test is not intended to test DUT behavior in the
   presence of malformed packets.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

9.  Security Considerations

   Benchmarking activities as described in this memo are limited to
   technology characterization using controlled stimuli in a laboratory
   environment, with dedicated address space and the constraints
   specified in the sections above.

   The benchmarking network topology will be an independent test setup
   and MUST NOT be connected to devices that may forward the test
   traffic into a production network, or misroute traffic to the test
   management network.

   Further, benchmarking is performed on a "black-box" basis, relying
   solely on measurements observable external to the DUT/SUT.  Special
   capabilities SHOULD NOT exist in the DUT/SUT specifically for
   benchmarking purposes.

   Any implications for network security arising from the DUT/SUT SHOULD
   be identical in the lab and in production networks.
