Internet-Draft       Multicast Anchoring in DMM              July 2015


Abstract

   In this draft, we define multicast support functions in a
   Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) environment. Based on the
   decomposed mobility management functions in [RFC7429], each defined
   multicast support function can be located and operated with DMM
   functions.

1. Introduction

   Based on [RFC7333], a multicast solution in Distributed Mobility
   Management (DMM) should be considered early in the process of
   designing protocol and deployment models. Multicast support in DMM
   should avoid inefficient methods, such as non-optimal forwarding or
   tunnel convergence.

   To support IP multicasting, we need several functions: a multicast
   routing protocol, membership management, etc. When we consider
   multicast support in DMM, we should determine how efficiently these
   functions can be operated with the mobility management functions in
   DMM. Possible use cases are already described in [Use Case for
   Multicast DMM]. However, since current DMM research considers
   control/data separation and functional decomposition, we need to
   define multicast support functions following decomposed DMM anchor
   functions and operate with them.

Internet-Draft       Multicast Anchoring in DMM              July 2015


   In this draft, we define multicast mobility management functions
   that enable us to deploy the DMM functions defined in [RFC7429]. We
   define multicast mobility management functions in a similar way
   because it is easier to deploy multicast mobility management
   functions with DMM functions.

2. Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC5213], [RFC3810],
   and [RFC4601]. New entities are defined by relying on the DMM
   functions specified in [RFC7429]:

   1. Anchoring Function (AF) is an allocation to a mobile node of an
   IP address (e.g. Home Address (HoA))) or prefix (e.g. Home Network
   Prefix (HNP)), topologically anchored by the advertising node.

   2. Internetwork Location Management (LM) function manages and keeps
   track of the internetwork location of an Mobile Node (MN). The
   location information may be a binding of the advertised IP
   address/prefix (e.g. HoA or HNP) to the MN's IP routing address, or
   it may be a binding of a node that can forward packets destined for
   the MN.

   3. Forwarding Management (FM) function intercepts and forwards a
   packet to/from the IP address/prefix assigned to the MN based on the
   internetwork location information, either to the destination or to
   some other network element that knows how to forward the packets to
   their destinations.

3. Multicast Support Functions in DMM

   In this chapter, we define functions to support multicasting in DMM
   environment. The multicast support of previous mobility management
   schemes (e.g., MIP and PMIP) deployed multicast router or MLD proxy
   functions into their mobility entities (e.g., HA, LMA, and MAG).
   According to the decomposition of previous mobility management
   functions and considering the separation of the control and data
   planes, a multicast support function could also decompose into
   several functions.

3.1. Multicast Anchoring Function (Multicast AF)

   A multicast AF is able to advertise multicast subscriptions into the
   DMM network. It also connects directly to the multicast
   infrastructure and runs multicast routing protocols (e.g., IGMP/MLD
   and PIM-SM). With a multicast AF, the network entity may be part of
   multicast tree. That is, multicast AFs have a Tree Information Base
   (TIB).

   To support multicast listeners, a multicast AF collects MLD report
   messages from mobile nodes or network entities. To provide an
   appropriate multicast subscription, a multicast AF should join/prune
   multicast channels based on MLD reports from mobile nodes. To
   support the multicast sender, this function forwards the source
   information of the sender to the Rendezvous Point (RP) in the
   multicast infrastructure.

   A multicast AF can separate the control and data planes.
   For example, the control plane of multicast anchoring can manage
   multicast tree information and share source information through the
   multicast infrastructure. The data plane of multicast anchoring can
   provide a multicast upstream/downstream interface and exchange
   messages based on multicast routing protocol.

   A multicast AF can be located and operated with a DMM AF. In this
   case, an AF can deliver multicast-related information when the
   mobile node assigns an IP address from the DMM AF.

3.2. Multicast Group Management Function

   A multicast group management function is an MLD proxy function
   defined in [RFC4605]. This function manages multicast subscriber and
   channel information. According to [RFC4605], MDL proxy devices
   maintain a membership database, which considers merging all
   subscriptions on the downstream interface. A membership database is
   presented a set of membership records, multicast addresses, filter
   modes and source lists. A multicast group management function can be
   extensible from the LM function or collocated with it in a DMM
   environment. In this case, group and membership information could be
   changed according to the location management entry in the LM
   function. Similarly, in [RFC6224], MAG sends MLD query messages
   directly to the MN and connects the appropriate uplink interface
   based on information received from the MN.

3.3. Multicast Forwarding Management Function (Multicast FM)

   A multicast FM function manages a forwarding state that is used to
   forward packets from a source to a multicast group. In addition,
   multicast FM for DMM should redirect multicast traffic when the MN
   moves to another attach point. This means that a multicast FM
   function should work with the FM function in DMM. To support
   mobility, MN multicast traffic can be forwarded by using a unicast
   traffic tunnel or by creating a dedicated multicast tunnel. An
   example of the former case is described in [RFC6224]. LMA
   establishes, maintains, and removes group- and source-specific
   multicast forwarding states in its corresponding downstream
   interfaces. Similar to the FM function in DMM, this function
   forwards multicast traffic according to its multicast forwarding
   information base.
