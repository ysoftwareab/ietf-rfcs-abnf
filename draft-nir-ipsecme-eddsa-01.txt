1.  Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange protocol [RFC7296] can use arbitrary
   signature algorithms as described in [RFC7427].  The latter RFC
   defines the SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification where each side of
   the IKE negotiation lists its supported hash algorithms.  This
   assumes that all signature schemes involve a hashing phase followed
   by a signature phase.  This made sense because most signature
   algorithms either cannot sign messages bigger than their key or
   truncate messages bigger than their key.

   EdDSA ([I.D-eddsa]) defines signature methods that do not require
   pre-hashing of the message.  Unlike other methods, these accept
   arbitrary-sized messages, so no pre-hashing is required.  These
   methods are called Ed25519 and Ed448, which respectively use the
   Edwards 25519 and the Edwards 448 ("Goldilocks") curves.  Although
   that document also defines pre-hashed versions of these algorithm,
   those versions are not recommended for protocols where the entire to-
   be-signed message is available at once.

   EdDSA defines the binary format of the signatures that should be used
   in the "Signature Value" field of the Authentication Data Format in
   section 3.  The "EdDSA, Ed25519, Ed448, Curve25519 and Curve448 for
   X.509" document ([I.D-curdle-pkix]) defines the object identifiers
   (OIDs) for these signature methods.  For convenience, these OIDs are
   repeated in Appendix A.

   In order to signal within IKE that no hashing needs to be done, we
   define a new value has in the SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification,
   one that indicates that no hashing is performed.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The "Identity" Hash Identifier

   This document defines a new value called "Identity" (value TBA by
   IANA) in the hash algorithm registry for use in the
   SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification.  Inserting this new value
   into the notification indicates that the receiver supports at least
   one signature algorithm that accepts arbitrary-sized messages such as
   Ed25519 and Ed448.

   Ed25519 and Ed448 are only defined with the Identity hash, and MUST
   NOT be sent to a receiver that has not indicated support for the
   "Identity" hash.

   The pre-hashed versions of Ed25519 and Ed448 (Ed25519ph and Ed448ph
   respectively) SHOULD NOT be used in IKE.

3.  Security Considerations

   The new "Identity" value is needed only for signature algorithms that
   accept an arbitrary-sized input.  It MUST NOT be used if none of the
   supported algorithms has this property.  On the other hand there is
   no good reason to pre-hash the inputs where the signature algorithm
   either does not require it or performs a hash internally.  For this
   reason implementations SHOULD have the "Identity" value in the
   SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification when they support EdDSA.
   Implementations SHOULD NOT have other hash algorithms in the
   notification if all signature algorithms have this property.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new value from the "IKEv2 Hash
   Algorithms" registry with name "Identity" and this document as
   reference.
