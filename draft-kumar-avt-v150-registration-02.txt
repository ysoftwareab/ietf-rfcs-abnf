                                Abstract 
 
This document defines a framework for the IANA registration of MIME types and 
SDP parameters defined in the ITU V.150.1 recommendation.  For SDP parameters, 
it does not repeat the details of syntax and semantics found in the ITU 
recommendation. For the MIME types, it provides RFC 2048-compliant MIME 
definitions which refer to the ITU V.150.1 recommendation for detailed format 
description. Until the ITU V.150.1 recommendation is ratified, this document 
should be considered work in progress.

1.   Introduction

           IANA Registration of ITU V.150.1 MIMEs and SDP parameters 
                                         
                                         
There is a need to register ITU V.150.1 parameters with the IANA/ICANN. These 
include (i) SDP parameters,  and (ii) MIME types. The IANA registration of MIME 
subtypes types in the IETF tree requires an RFC approved by the IESG. This 
document is meant to fulfill that role. 
 
The ITU V.150.1 recommendation is meant to standardize, in a comprehensive 
manner, the encapsulation of modem signals within IP. This includes both modem 
passthrough and modem relay operation. The ITU V.150.1 recommendation, which has 
been crafted over a period of about two years has been approved for consent 
(October 25)and is close to finalization.  
  
This internet draft is initially submitted to the IETF's AVT working group 
because of the presence of new MIME definitions. Review by the IETF's MMUSIC 
working group is also solicited. 
 
2. Overview of Parameters to be registered 
 
The following parameters defined in ITU V.150.1 recommendation need to be 
registered with the  IANA: 
 
  1. New MIME types:   audio/v150mr and audio/v150fw. These indicate media  
     formats defined, in the ITU V.150.1 recommendation, for use in the modem-
     over-IP context. MIME registration applications based on RFC 2048 [4] are 
     in Section 4. These refer to the ITU V.150.1 recommendation for detailed 
     format descriptions and semantics. 
 
  2. New SDP parameters (Section 3). These include a new transport protocol 
     (udpsprt, section 3.1) and several new SDP attributes (Section 3.2). 
     Precise details of their syntax and semantics, found in ITU recommendation 
     V.150.1, are not repeated.

           IANA Registration of ITU V.150.1 MIMEs and SDP parameters 
                                         
                                         
 
3.   Registration of new SDP parameters 
 
3.1 Registration of the  'udpsprt' transport protocol 
 
The 'udpsprt' (Simple Packet Relay Transport over UDP) protocol should be 
registered as a value of the SDP field "proto", referring to the transport 
protocol. 
 
Details of the 'udpsprt' (Simple Packet Relay Transport over UDP) protocol are 
found in [1]. This is a reliable protocol that can be used to efficiently 
guarantee packet delivery in an IP network that is prone to packet loss.  
 
3.2  Registration of new SDP attributes 
 
New SDP attributes defined in ITU V.150.1 [1] should be registered as values of 
the SDP field "att-field".  Details of these attributes, listed below,  are 
found in [1]:  
 
  1. sprtparm, a list of parameters qualifying the 'udpsprt' protocol. 
  2. sprtmap, which dynamically defines a numerical identifier for modem relay 
     packets. 
  3. vndpar (vendor parameters), used to declare vendor-specific parameters. 
 
The SDP attribute 'gpmd' (general-purpose media descriptor) is addressed 
elsewhere [2]. This attribute is used extensively in ITU V.150.1 systems. 
 
4.   Registration of new MIME types 
 
4.1  Registration of the audio/v150mr MIME type 
 
This MIME represents the modem relay packet format as defined in the ITU V.150.1 
recommendation. Hence the suffix 'mr' (modem relay).   
 
     MIME media type name: audio 
      
     MIME subtype name: v150mr 
      
     Required parameters: 
          mr: the type of modem relay, from the set "0" (ITU V.8-compatible  
          modem relay) and "1" (universal modem relay). 
 
          mg: the type of media gateway, from the set "0" (No Transcompression), 
          "1" (Single Transcompression) and "2" (Double Transcompression. 
           
          CDSCselect: Call discrimination mode selection, from the set 1  
          ('audio (RFC 2833)'), 2 ('VBD-preferred'), 3 (Mixed). 
           
          mrmods: This parameter lists supported modulation types.  These are 
          listed as one or more comma-separated elements, where each element is 
          either a single integer or two integers separated by a hyphen. No 
          white space is allowed. The integers, which  designate modulation

           IANA Registration of ITU V.150.1 MIMEs and SDP parameters 
                                         
                                         
          types are from the set "1" (V.34 duplex), "2" (V.34 Half-duplex), "3" 
          (V.32bis/V.32), "4" (V.22bis/V.22), "5" (V.17), "6" (V.29 half-
          duplex), "7" (V.27 ter), "8" (V.26 ter), "9" (V.26bis), "10" (V.23 
          duplex), "11" (V.23 half duplex), "12" (V.21), "13" (V.90 analog), 
          "14" (V.90 digital), "15" (V.91), "16" (V.92 analog) and "17" (V.92 
          digital). 
           
          jmdelay: indicates support of  JM delay procedures. Permissible values 
          are "yes" and "no". 
           
     Optional parameters: 
      
          versn: Composite representation of the version of the ITU V.150  
          Recommendation used. Dotted representation, x.y, where the integer 'x'  
          is the suffix in the number of the controlling Recommendation ('1' for 
          ITU V.150.1), and the integer 'y' is the version of this 
          Recommendation  ('2' for the version 2 of Recommendation V.150.1). The  
          default is fixed or configured for the Gateway or endpoint.  
          Declaration of a value of this parameter implies backward  
          compatibility with earlier versions (values of 'y') and document 
          suffixes (values of 'x'). 
           
          txalgs: This parameter lists supported optional transcompression 
          algorithms. Not listed is  ITU V.42bis, which is mandatory.  This list 
          consists of  one or more comma-separated elements. Each element can 
          either be a single integer or two integers separated by a hyphen. No 
          white space is allowed. The integers, which  designate 
          transcompression algorithms are from the set "1" (ITU V.44), "2" 
          (MNP5). If this parameter is omitted, ITU V.44 and MNP5 are not 
          supported. 
           
          V42bNumCodewords: Proposed number of ITU V.42bis code words. This is 
          an integer in the range 512 û 65535, with a default of 1024. 
           
          v42bMaxStringLength: Maximum ITU V.42bis string size, range 6-250. The 
          default, when omitted, is 32. 
           
          v44NumTxCodewords: Proposed number of ITU V.44 transmitter code words. 
          This is an integer in the range 256 û 65535, with a default of 1024. 
           
          v44NumRxCodewords: Proposed number of ITU V.44 receiver code words. 
          This is an integer in the range 256 û 65535, with a default of 1024. 
           
          v44MaxTxStringLength: Maximum ITU V.44 transmitter string size, range 
          32 û 255. The default, when omitted, is 64. 
           
          v44MaxRxStringLength: Maximum ITU V.44 receiver string size, range 32 
          û  255. The default, when omitted, is 64. 
           
          V44LenTxHistory: Proposed size of the V.44 transmitter history, range 
          512 û 65535. The default, when omitted, is 3072. 
           
          V44LenRxHistory: Proposed size of the V.44 receiver history, range 512 
          û 65535. The default, when omitted, is 3072. 
           
          TCXpreference: When two double transcompression (D-TCX) gateways are 
          connected, this parameter indicates preference for the initial  
          transcompression mode. Possible values are 1 ('single') and 2 
          ('double'), with 1 as the default.

           IANA Registration of ITU V.150.1 MIMEs and SDP parameters 
                                         
                                         
           
           
     Encoding considerations:  
          The  MIME audio/v150mr uses the 'udpsprt' (Simple Packet Relay 
          Transport over UDP) reliable transport protocol as defined in the ITU 
          V.150.1 recommendation. As such, it consists of packets of binary 
          data. 
           
     Security considerations:   
          The privacy and integrity of the data transmitted via V.150.1 modem 
          relay must be ensured at the  application level by means such as 
          encryption. The V.150.1 modem relay protocol does not hinder such end-
          to-end data protection. Nor does it provide any additional, inbuilt 
          safeguards that can be used in the absence of end-to-end, application-
          level data security. The transcompression and other algorithms  used 
          in V.150.1 modem relay are published in various standards and can be 
          implemented by a resourceful attacker. 
 
          Likewise, V.150.1 modem relay procedures do not address session 
          authentication, which must be handled end-to-end by client and server  
          authentication applications. Authentication is out of the scope of a 
          bearer-level protocol such as V.150.1 modem relay. 
           
          Resource usage by a modem relay session may be monitored to prevent 
          denial of service attacks. The resource utilization of modem relay 
          sessions does not exhibit such non-uniformity so as to preclude such 
          resource limiting. 
            
          The MIME type contains no executable content that affects sessions or 
          session legs other than the ones in which the requester is a 
          participant. For these session legs, executable content in the form of 
          modem relay control messages is well within the normal prerogatives of 
          the requester.  
           
          Like other  encodings with open-ended content, the ITU V.150.1  
          modem relay format may be abused by hiding data using steganography.  
          However, due to its more limited context, it is unlikely that it  
          will be preferred for such misuse vis-a-vis other audio and video  
          encodings. 
 
     Interoperability considerations: Interoperability is limited to endpoints  
          or gateways that implement the mandatory parts of the ITU V.150.1 
          recommendation, "Procedures for the end-to-end connection of V-series 
          DCEs over an IP Network". Backward compatibility will be maintained 
          between all versions of this recommendation. 
            
     Published specification: The ITU V.150.1 specification, approved for  
          consent on October 25, 2002. 
            
     Applications which use this media:   
          Endpoints and media gateways that interface with V-series modems on 
          one end, and with an IP network on the other end. In this case, the 
          on-ramp gateway does not support full modem termination which would 
          have allowed forwarding via a higher-layer protocol.

4.2  Registration of the audio/v150fw MIME type   
 
This MIME represents the format of  messages used to define the contextual 
framework of  information transfer operation as defined in the ITU V.150.1 
recommendation. Hence the suffix 'fw' (framework). 
  
 
     MIME media type name: audio 
      
     MIME subtype name: v150fw 
      
     Required parameters: None.  
      
     Optional parameters: 
      
          events: The "events" parameter lists the framework event messages 
          supported by the media gateway or endpoint. Events are listed as one 
          or more comma-separated elements. Each element can either be a single 
          integer, or two integers separated by a hyphen.  The latter indicates 
          a range of integers. No white space is allowed in the representation. 
          The integers, which  identify event types are from the set "0" (null), 
          "1" (initial audio), "2" (voice band data), "3" (modem relay), "4" 
          (text relay), "5" (fax relay). When omitted, the default is 0-4.  
           
          expack: indicates whether explicit framework message acknowledgement 
          procedures, as defined in the ITU V.150.1 recommendation are enabled 
          or not. Both sides must enable these procedures in order for them to 
          be used. Permissible values are "yes" and "no". 
 
           
     Encoding considerations:  
          Like all other ITU V.150.1 media formats except modem relay, the MIME 
          audio/v150fw uses the RTP protocol. As such, it consists of packets of 
          binary data. The RTP payload is defined in the ITU V.150.1 
          recommendation. 
           
     Security considerations:   
          As with other RTP formats, it is possible to use IPSEC to ensure the 
          authenticity, integrity and privacy of this media format. Since this 
          media format is uncompressed, there is no potential conflict between 
          compression and encryption. Many applications use modem relay between 
          trusted network equipment and, as such, may forego the use of IPSEC. 
          When used with equipment in untrusted areas, the impact of the V.150 
          framework messages is limited to one session. Hence, any exposure from 
          not encrypting this media format is limited. 
            
          Resource usage by V.150 framework messages may be monitored to prevent 
          denial of service attacks. Since the resource utilization of these 
          messages is minimal, resource limiting is not precluded. 
            
          The MIME type contains no executable content that affects sessions or 
          session legs other than the ones in which the requester is a 
          participant. For these session legs, executable content in the form of 
          V.150 framework messages is well within the normal prerogatives of the 
          requester.

          Since the content associated with this MIME type is well-defined and 
          not open-ended, it is not vulnerable to hiding data using 
          steganography.

5.   Security Considerations 
 
This document does not impose any security considerations of its own, apart from 
the security considerations associated with each MIME type is contains. 
 
Security considerations for SDP parameters defined in this document are 
unchanged from RFC 2327 [3]. 
 
6.   IANA Considerations 
 
The entirety of this document is for IANA review and is limited to such 
information as pertinent to the IANA registration of MIME types and SDP 
parameters. Details found in ITU Recommendation V.150.1 [1] are not repeated, 
except as necessitated by MIME registration rules [4].
