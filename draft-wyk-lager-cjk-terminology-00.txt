               CJK Terminology for Label Generation Rules
                   draft-wyk-lager-cjk-terminology-00

Abstract

   Chinese Generation Panel [CGP], Japanese Generation Panel [JGP], and
   Korean Generation Panel [KGP] are collaborating to develop Root zone
   LGR [RootLGR] for Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK).  During the cross-
   communities collaboration work, CJK GPs, together with Integration
   Panel [IP] members, recognized that a common terminology definition
   for key concepts is essential in order to have an efficient,
   transparent and smooth progress of developing CJK Label Generation
   Rules (LGR) [I-D.ietf-lager-specification].

1.  Introduction

   Developing Label Generation Rules (LGR)
   [I-D.ietf-lager-specification] sometimes requires collaborative work
   within relevant language and/or script communities.  For example,
   Chinese Generation Panel [CGP], Japanese Generation Panel [JGP], and
   Korean Generation Panel [KGP] are collaborating to develop Root zone
   LGR [RootLGR] for Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK).  For the efficient,
   transparent and the smooth progress of the collaboration work, such
   groups should have common terminology definition for key concepts as
   the solid basis of cross-communities cooperation.  This document
   provides CJK LGR terminology defined by CGP, JGP and KGP.

2.  CJK LGR Terminology

2.1.  Script

   Based on Unicode [Unicode], script is a collection of letters and
   other written signs used to represent textual information in one or
   more writing systems.  Ex.  Han, Hiragana, Katakana and Hangul.

Internet-Draft             CJK LGR Terminology               August 2015


2.2.  Chinese script, Japanese script, Korean script

   Script(s) used in the language.  Chinese script is Han, Japanese
   script is a mixture of Han, Hiragana and Katakana, and Korean script
   is a mixture of Han and Hangul.

   In Root zone LGR context, Chinese script, Japanese script and Korean
   script are equivalent to und-Hani, und-Jpan and und-Kore
   respectively.  Here, Hani, Jpan and Kore are terms from ISO 15924
   [ISO15924].

2.3.  Disposition

   Result of whole label evaluation (WLE).  Disposition is assigned to a
   label, not to a character.  In general, the Root zone process only
   allows the two dispositions 'allocatable' and 'blocked' (as well as
   'invalid' for labels that are not valid at all).  It is not possible
   to add new dispositions for labels other than 'allocatable',
   'blocked' and 'invalid'.  Label disposition assigned as a result of
   WLE cannot be reassigned.

2.4.  Variant type, variant subtype

   Variant type is an attribute of a code point, which indicates the
   treatment of the variant in WLE rules and actions.  Default variant
   type is one of (A) allocatable, (B) blocked, and (C) out of
   repertoire var.  A variant subtype is a variation of variant type
   with certain limitation.  For example, in the Chinese script LGR,
   variant type "allocatable" is substituted by "simp" (stands for
   simplified), "trad" (stands for "traditional") and "both" (stands for
   both simplified and traditional) subtypes.  The variant subtype can
   be defined by each GP.  Each variant type and variant subtype has to
   have one or more corresponding <action> elements in WLE.

2.5.  LGR-alpha

   LGR-alpha designates the LGR defined by each GP for CJK integration
   purposes.  Each CJK GP can define its LGR-alpha independently from
   each other.  The LGR-alpha must consist of language tag (one of und-
   Hani, und-Jpan, and und-Kore), repertoire of allowed characters for
   applied-for label, variants of each character where variant type (and
   variant subtype if necessary) is associated with each variant
   characters, and WLE.  The variant type must not have "out of
   repertoire var".  The LGR-alpha is an intermediate product and it is
   not a final proposal of each GP.  The development of LGR-alpha can be
   iterative (cyclic).  Once CJK GPs generate each LGR-beta, each GP
   assess it and modify LGR-alpha if necessary.  This cycle can be
   repeated until all CJK GPs get conclusion.

2.6.  LGR-beta

   LGR-beta designates the LGR generated by LGR-alpha integration
   process.  The LGR-beta is generated for each Chinese/Japanese/Korean
   script.  The differences between each LGR-beta are (A) language tag,
   (B) repertoire, and (C) variant type (including variant subtype) of
   each variant.  The set of variants and WLE are common between LGR-
   betas.  Once each CJK GP has concluded their LGR-alpha, the generated
   LGR-beta is incorporated into the final LGR proposal from each of
   them.
