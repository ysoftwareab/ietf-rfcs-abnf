1.  Introduction

   When RFC 8029 [RFC8029] where published it contained among other
   things updates to the "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters" IANA name space
   [IANA-LSP-PING].

   The LSP Ping IANA registries were partly updated to match RFC 8029,
   but the there were some ambiguity in the RFC, that were reflected in
   the registries.

   This document updates two groups of registries.

   First the registries for Message Types [MessTypes], Reply Modes
   [re-Mode] and Return Codes [return-codes].  The changes to these
   registries are minor.

   Second, this document updates the TLV and sub-TLV registries.

   o  TLVs [tlv-reg]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLVs 1, 16 and 21 [sub-1-16-21]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 6 [sub-6]

Internet-Draft             LSP Ping Registries                 July 2019


   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 11 [sub-11]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 20 [sub-20]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 23 [sub-23]

   o  Sub-TLVs for TLV 27 [sub-27]

   The registry for sub-TLVs for TLV 9 [sub-9] is not updated.

1.1.  Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Updating the Message Types, Reply Mode and Return Codes Registries

   The following changes are made to the Message Types, Reply Modes and
   Return Codes [MessTypes] registries.

   o  a small set of code points (4 code points) for experimental use is
      added, actually they are take from the range for "Private Use".

   o  the registration procedure "Specification Required" is changed to
      "RFC Required" and the note "Experimental RFC needed" is removed

   o  In the listing of assignments the term "Vendor Specific Use" is
      changed to "Private use"

   o  the registration procedures "Private Use" and "Experimental Use"
      are added to the table of registration procedures

   o  A note "Not to be assigned" is added for the registration
      procedures "Private Use" and "Experimental Use"

   o  In the list that capture nment status, the fields that are
      reserved, i.e.  0, Private Use and Experimental Use are clearly
      marked.

      *  In the Return Codes [return-codes] registry the code point "0"
         already been assigned.  This assignment is not changed and this
         registry will not havethe "0" value "Reserved".

   The new Registration Procedures layout and the new assignments for
   these registries will be found in Appendix A.

3.  Updating the TLV and sub-TLV registries

   When a new LSP Ping sub-TLV registry were created by RFC 8611
   [RFC8611] this registry "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6" [sub-6] was set up
   following the intentions of RFC 8029.

   The registry for "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6" will serve as a model to
   change/update the rest of the TLV and sub-TLV registries in this name
   space.

   The registration procedures in the current registry for "Sub-TLVs for
   TLV Type 6" looks like this (2019-06-20).  This will be used as a
   base-line and some additions/changes will be made as captured in the
   Appendixes:

   +-------------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
   | Range       | Registration      | Note                            |
   |             | Procedures        |                                 |
   +-------------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
   | 0-16383     | Standards Action  | This range is for mandatory     |
   |             |                   | TLVs or for optional TLVs that  |
   |             |                   | require an error message if not |
   |             |                   | recognized.                     |
   | 16384-31743 | RFC Required      | This range is for mandatory     |
   |             |                   | TLVs or for optional TLVs that  |
   |             |                   | require an error message if not |
   |             |                   | recognized.                     |
   | 31744-32767 | Private Use       | Not to be assigned              |
   | 32768-49161 | Standards Action  | This range is for optional TLVs |
   |             |                   | that can be silently dropped if |
   |             |                   | not recognized.                 |
   | 49162-64511 | RFC Required      | This range is for optional TLVs |
   |             |                   | that can be silently dropped if |
   |             |                   | not recognized.                 |
   | 64512-65535 | Private Use       | Not to be assigned              |
   +-------------+-------------------+---------------------------------+

              Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 6 Registration Procedures

   This document adds small ranges of code points for Experimental Use
   to this registry and to registries listed in Appendix B.

   All registries will be changed to reflect the same model.

3.1.  General principles the LSP Ping TLV and sub-TLV registries

   The following principles are valid for all the LSP Ping TLV and sub-
   TLV IANA registries

   o  all mandatory TLVs and sub-TLVs requires a response if the are not
      recognized

   o  some optional TLVs and sub-TLVs requires a response if the are not
      recognized

   o  some optional TLVs and sub-TLVs may be silently dropped if the are
      not recognized

   The range of each TLV and sub-TLV registry is divided into to blocks,
   one with a range from 0 to 49161 for TLVs and sub-TLVs that require a
   response if not recognized.  Another block in the range from 49161 to
   65535, this block is for TLVs and sub-TLVs that may be silently
   dropped if not recognized.

   Each of the blocks have code point spaces with the following
   registration procedures:

   o  Standards Action

   o  RFC Required

   o  Experimental Use

   o  Private Use

   The exact defintion of registration procedures for IANA registries
   are found in [RFC8126]

   IETF does not prescribe how the Experimental Use and Private Use sub-
   TLVs are handled; however, if a packet containing a sub-TLV from the
   Experimental Use or Private Use ranges is received by an LSR that
   does not recognize the sub-TLV, an error message MAY be returned if
   the sub-TLV is from the range 31744-32767, and the packet SHOULD be
   silently dropped if it is from the range 64512-65535.

3.2.  Changes to the LSP Ping registries

   This section lists the changes to each LSP Ping Registry, in
   appendixes it is shown what the IANA registry version of the
   registration procedures and assignments would look like.

3.2.1.  Common changes to the TLV and sub-TLV registries

   The following changes are made to the TLV and sub-TLV registries.

   o  two small set of code points (2 times 4 code points) for
      experimental use is added, actually they are take from the range
      for "Private Use".

   o  the registration procedure "Specification Required" is changed to
      "RFC Required" and the note "Experimental RFC needed" is removed

   o  In the listing of assignements the term "Vendor Specific Use" is
      changed to "Private use"

   o  In the listing of assignments the range for "Experimental Use" is
      added

   o  the registration procedures "Private Use" and "Experimental Use"
      are added to the table of registration procedures

   o  A note "Not to be assigned" is added for the registration
      procedures "Experimental Use" and "Private Use"

   o  In the list that capture assignment status, the fields that are
      reserved, i.e.  0, Experimental Use and Private Use are clearly
      marked.

   The new Registration Procedures description and the new assignments
   for these registries will be found in Appendix B and Appendix C.

4.  Security Considerations

   TBA

5.  IANA Considerations

   There are no requests for IANA actions in this document.

   This is obviously not true, the entire document is an IANA
   Consideration section,but we need some help how to write the IANA
   section in this type of document.

   Maybe we could just say, IANA is requested to update the LSP Ping
   name space as described in this document.
