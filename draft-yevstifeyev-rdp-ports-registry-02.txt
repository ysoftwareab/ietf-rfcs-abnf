1.  Introduction and Overview

   Reliable Data Protocol (RDP) is defined in RFC 908 [RFC908], that has
   been updated by RFC 1151 [RFC1151].  The most current specification
   [RFC1151] mentions RDP to use the 16-bit port number, but does not
   define assignment procedures for them.  This document does just this.
   It updates RFC 1151 [RFC1151] and RFC TBD1 [I.D. draft-ietf-tsvwg-
   iana-ports], that specifies assignment procedures for TCP, UDP, SCTP
   and DCCP port numbers assignment, by augmenting its action on RDP.


2.  Registration Procedures

   Since issues discussed on section 6 of RFC TBD1 [I.D. draft-ietf-
   tsvwg-iana-ports] concern RDP as well, Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) is asked to create the independent registry for RDP
   port numbers and maintain it following Section 8 of RFC TBD1 [I.D.
   draft-ietf-tsvwg-iana-ports] and this document.

2.1. Reserved Ports

   IANA is asked to reserve the following RDP ports for future use: 0,
   1023, 1024, 49151.

2.2. Values Used for Experimentation

INTERNET DRAFT                 RDP Ports                 January 8, 2011


   IANA is asked to mark 2 RDP ports - 1021 and 1022 - as reserved for
   experimentation.


3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to perform the actions described in Section 2 of this
   document.


4.  Security Considerations

   The document does not introduce any new security issues to RDP.
