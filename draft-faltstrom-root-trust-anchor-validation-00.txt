Internet-Draft        Root trust anchor validation            April 2009


1.  Introduction

   In deployment of DNSSEC [RFC4033], the root zone will have one or
   more Key Signing Keys (KSK) each having a private and public part.
   The public part is to be used for verification of the trust chain and
   because of that distributed to and trusted by every resolver that
   want to verify DNSSEC signed responses.

   As the distribution of the public part of the KSK is made using
   electronic communication mechanisms, and replaced frequently, it is
   important that the distribution made in a way so that the integrity
   of the KSK can be verified.  The simplest way to manage this is to
   sign the public part of the KSK, and have the digital signature of
   the KSK, and therefore the public part of the key that signs the KSK,
   be what is trusted by the resolver.

   To be able to handle changes in the KSK in an automated fashion,
   while at the same time allow external organisations to audit the KSK
   management, and give the ability for parties that is to trust the KSK
   to automatically do so, it is proposed to have a recommended way of
   managing this distribution of the public part of the KSK.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   KSK  Key Signing Key
   ZSK  Zone Signing Key
   TAR  Trust Anchor Repository
   TAR Signee  An entity signing the TAR
   TAR Consumer  An entity using the contents of the TAR as DNSSEC trust
      anchors, possibly based on the signatures created by the TAR
      signees.


3.  Proposed Architecture

   It is proposed that the public key signing keys (KSKs) for the root
   zone are distributed in the form of a trust anchor repository (TAR)
   signed by multiple parties.

   To be able to put trust in the KSKs, and therefore in the root zone
   signing process, the TAR signees should be able to audit the root
   signing policies and procedures.

   The signing mechanisms should be such that the TAR can be signed by
   more than one entity.  It should be possible to for each signee to
   sign the TAR separately form other signees.

   After the entities have signed the TAR, it is to be distributed.  In
   some cases by the entities that sign it, in other cases by third
   parties.  It is up to the TAR distributor to bundle the TAR with the
   signatures made by the TAR signees.  A TAR distributor might choose
   to not include all signatures in the distribution.

   Someone that receive such a signed TAR can verify the signatures and
   that way ensure two things - that the contents of the TAR has not
   changed during transmission and that the current process used for
   managing the keys that forms the TAR is trusted by the TAR signee.

   It is suggested that the lifetime of the signatures on the TAR is
   potentially shorter than the administrative lifetime of the TAR
   contents (e.g. keys and fingerprints).  This enables the ability for
   the signee to do the audit of the root signing policies and
   procedures repeatedly over time.

   If the consumer of the TAR cannot validate enough signatures, it is
   recommended that the contents of the TAR should not be used to
   configure the validating DNSSEC resolver.


4.  Trust Anchor Repository Signatures

   The signees may sign the TAR using a detached signature created using
   either OpenPGP [RFC4880] or S/MIME [RFC3851].


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.


6.  Security Considerations

   DNSSEC adds data origin authentication and data integrity to the DNS.
   Because of this, DNSSEC is almost certainly necessary for any
   application mechanism that stores authorization data in the DNS.

   If the signature(s) on the TAR does not validate, the content of the
   TAR is not to be used for configuration of the DNSSEC verifying
   resolver.  This might lead to the resolver ignoring all DNSSEC signed
   data that can not be verified using a trust chain to some other trust
   anchor, and because of this it might lead to it not returning any

   responses to queries that reaches it.  A signature on the TAR that is
   not renewed might because of this lead to DNS resolution not work
   (from the client perspective).  Local policy in the resolver is to be
   carefully tuned to take care of these situations.

   The mechanisms described in this document does not introduce any new
   security implications than what traditionally is the case for
   detached signatures for PGP and/or S/MIME.
