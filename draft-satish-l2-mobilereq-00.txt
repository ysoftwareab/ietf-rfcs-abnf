Abstract 
    
IP mobility protocols have traditionally been designed to be 
independent of any L2 considerations.  A critical factor in achieving
good performance for IP mobility protocols is the design of L2 
handover. Handover occurs when a Mobile Node moves from one radio 
Access Point to another. If the new radio Access Point is associated 
with a new subnet, a change in routing reachability may occur and 
require L3 protocol action on the part of the Mobile Node or Access 
Routers. Better synchronization between L2 handover and L3 handover 
becomes still more important when supporting fast handoff between  
two wireless domains. Prompt and timely information from L2 to the 
parties involved about the  sequencing of handover can help optimize 
handover at the IP level. This draft discusses requirements for an 
L2 handover API support to optimize layer 3 handover.

1.0 Introduction 
    
An important consideration in the design of IP mobility protocols is
handover. A moving Mobile Node (MN) may irregularly need to change the
radio Access Point (AP) with which it is communicating. The change in 
L2 connectivity to a new AP may cause a change in IP routing 
reachability, and this requires either the MN or the Access Routers 
(ARs) to perform actions that update routing information for the MN. 
Even if no change in subnet occurs, the APs may still need to 
communicate the change in on-link reachability to the local AR. For 
a handover to occur, candidate APs must be identified and a target AP 
must be selected [10]. Once the initial identification and decision are
complete, the handover process can begin. 
    
Several protocol designs have been advanced for Mobile IP that seek 
to reduce the amount of handover latency at L3 [3] [4] [5]. These 
protocols depend on timely information from the L2 protocol about 
the progress of handover. L2 handover progress information also 
affects context transfer [6] and candidate access router discovery
[10]. Context transfer involves moving context information QoS, 
header compression, authentication, etc.) from the old AR to the 
new. By moving such context information, the ARs can avoid requiring 
the MN to set up all the context information from scratch, 
considerably reducing the amount of time necessary to set up basic 
network service on the new subnet. If handover progress information 
is available from L2, context transfer can proceed more quickly.
   
This document discusses requirements on underlying systems for
supporting optimized IP mobility, in particular, handover. While the
document has been written with existing Mobile IP work in mind, it

should be applicable to any protocol that can benefit from knowledge
about L2 handover sequencing to facilitate mobility. L2 requirements 
for assisting in handover between two APs on the same subnet, between 
two ARs on different subnets, for context transfer and candidate 
access router discovery are discussed.
    
2.0  Terminology 
    
The following terms are used in this document [11]. 
    
      Access Point (AP) 
           A Layer 2 (L2) access entity, e.g. a radio transceiver 
station, that is connected to one or more Access Routers. Its primary
function is to provide MNs an L2 wireless link via its specific 
air-interface technology.     
    
      Access Router (AR) 
        A Layer 3 (L3) IP router, residing in an access network and 
connected to one or more Access Points. An AR is the first hop router
for a MN. 
    
      L2 Handover 
         Change of MN's link layer connection from one AP to another.
    
      L3 Handover 
         Change of MN's routable address from one AR to another. An L3
handover results in a change in the MN's routing reachability that 
will require action on the part of the IP mobility protocol 
running in the MN and/or ARs. 
    
3.0 L2 Trigger Definition 
    
This section discusses defining L2 triggers that provide information 
on the sequencing of handover. An L2 trigger is not associated with 
any specific L2 but rather is based on the kind of L2 information 
that is or could be available from a wide variety of radio link 
protocols. L2 triggers are defined based on a generic decomposition 
of the L2 handover process. 
   
An L2 trigger is a notification from L2 (potentially including 
parameter information) that a certain event has happened or is 
about to happen. The trigger may be implemented in a variety of 
ways. Some examples are provided in [11]. Apart from what is 
mentioned in [11] An L2 trigger can also be information may be 
available as an out of band communication signal. 
 
   In any case, the implementation details of how the information
involved in an L2 trigger are transferred to the IP mobility protocol
are likely to color how the mobility protocol is implemented on top of
that L2, but they should not influence the specification of the abstract
L2 triggers themselves.

3.1 Decomposition of the L2 handoff process for identifying L2 triggers
   This section deals with identifying the L2 handoff process steps to
better understand the L2 triggers that can facilitate better L3 
handover. It is assumed that triggers emanating from such decomposition
may not be mandatory. Three steps are identified in the L2 handoff
process and appropriate triggers will be identified to better serve L3
handoff. The steps identified are 
1.The handoff initiation stage, 
2.The handoff decision stage and 
3.The handoff execution stage.

Such decomposition allows the L2 to specify triggers that go beyond the
"Link Up" and "Link down" L2 notifications. The identification of
Intermediate states in L2 handoff provides for notifications, which span
the time between a handoff initiation and an actual L2 handoff. Further
it is assumed that the L2 handoff is of a "make before break nature" to
allow for service continuity.

3.1.1 L2 handoff Initiation stage

The Initiation phase identifies the need for handover and subsequently
initiates it. L2 handover initiation triggers can originate from an MN
or the AP. The MN L2 initiation may be due to a degradation of perceived
QoS. The AP initiation may be to serve any time dependent load factors.
The reasons for a handover initiation can be any of the following
Availability, Congestion, Effective S/R, Emergency service,
Interference, Loading, Macro/Micro/Pico - Operator policy like handover
slow moving users to pico and fast moving users to larger cells,
Security levels, Network forced maintained, QoS -(BW (bits/s), delay,
delay variation, Error rate etc, Service provider influence etc. 

L2 handoff initiation triggers can be used by L3 for fast handoff
initiation. L3 fast handoff initiation may include identification of CAR
for handoff. Here L2 handoff initiation trigger is a notification to L3
sent at the start of the L2 handoff initiation. This trigger can be
indicative of the L2 handoff threshold crossing. Further initiation
start and initiation complete triggers can be specified to accommodate
for spurious signal levels. 

3.1.2 L2 handoff decision stage

The L2 handover decision phase compares information from a variety of
sources with recorded user preferences and network policy. It also
involves identifying the best available handover taking into
consideration user preference and network policy. It then notifies the
handoff execution module for an L2 handoff execution. 

L2 decision stage trigger can be used to achieve a better conventional 
MIP handoff.

Internet Draft        Optimized IP Mobility...       Feb 2002


3.1.3 L2 handoff Execution stage
The objective of the handover execution phase is to change code,
technology or network conforming to the details resolved to in the
decision phase. This stage typically involves connection changes or
radio access node change. Further it also involves control point
transfer signaling and security related signaling. 

The L2 handoff execution trigger can be used to achieve optimized
conventional L3 handoff. It can also act as a pre-registration abort
signal and fall back on the post registration in case of combined fast
handoff method. 
   
3.2. Information in an L2 Trigger 
    
There are three types of information involved in defining an L2 trigger:
    1. The trigger type and sub type information
    Ex: Initiation trigger
    Subtype: Cause  

    2. The parameters delivered with the trigger. 

    3. The IP entity that receives the L2 trigger, 
         The L3 handoff initiation module
         The L3 handoff decision module
         The L3 execution module

The IP entities that can receive the trigger depend on the particular
IP mobility protocol in use. Assumption of the decomposition as
mentioned above is still valid for any given IP mobility protocol.


4.0 Requirements for L2 Triggers 
    
L2 handover, L3 handover, and context transfer events and related
protocols would benefit from a collection of L2 triggers. Some of these protocols directly rely on the existence of certain triggers and perform
better when others are available. As such, L2 triggers should be
designed to meet these protocol needs. The need for L2 triggers has been
highlighted in [11]. Current trends in wireless networking suggest that
future wireless networks will consist of a variety of heterogeneous
wireless APs connected into the wired network, may be on the same subnet
or may not be on the same subnet. A change in wireless AP, either
between an AP supporting one wireless link technology and an AP
supporting another, or between two APs supporting the same wireless
technology, necessarily results in a change in the on-subnet
reachability. Packet delivery within the subnet can be optimized if this
information can be propagated to the AR, so it can update its on-subnet
L2 address to IP address mapping.  
 
Also there is a general perception that interoperability suffers if
there is no L2-independent way of reporting on-link movement. Handoffs


Satish et Al                                       [Page 5]
Internet Draft        Optimized IP Mobility...       Feb 2002


in most L2s can be decomposed into a sequence of steps as has been
highlighted in the previous section. Such a generic decomposition helps
in consolidating a set of triggers from an underlying L2 to support
better L3 handoff even under diverse L2 considerations. L3 handoff may
or may not depend completely on the underlying L2 triggers. L3 handover
may depend on a combination of L2 triggers and triggers from other
entities. It is to be understood that the availability of additional L2
triggers will only facilitate better L3 handover.


4.1. L2 triggers for conventional L3 Handover

L2 triggers like the "link tear down" and "link establishment" can be
used to indicate departure and arrival of a MN at AP/ARs. Such
indications can replace L3 signal exchange and therefore expedite the
process. An L2 that supports a collection of such triggers is a good
candidate for a high performance Mobile IP implementation. The L2
handoff execution trigger can be used to achieve optimized conventional
L3 handoff. 

4.2. L2 triggers for fast L3 handover support

Low latency handover protocol designs for Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6
[3] [4] [5] rely on the existence of certain L2 triggers. Either the MN
or the AP/AR needs to receive an indication that the handoff is imminent
for these L3 mobility protocols to work. This trigger must be received
by the MN for mobile-controlled handovers, and received by the AP/AR for
network-controlled handovers. Timely receipt of this trigger is needed
as protocol signaling needs to take place in parallel with the handoff.
Protocol signaling over the current link should be completed prior to
loss of connectivity. 

L2 handoff initiation triggers can be used by L3 for fast handoff initiation. L3 fast handoff initiation may include CAR discovery for handoff. 

L2 decision stage trigger can ease the L3 decision process i.e. the
target access router can be indicated in the L2 decision stage trigger.
It can also be used to achieve a better conventional MIP handoff. 

The L2 handoff execution trigger can be used to achieve optimized
conventional L3 handoff. It can also act as a pre-registration abort
signal to fall back on the post registration in case of combined fast
handoff method. 

4.3. L2 Triggers For Context Transfer
 
Context transfer (CT) is an evolving topic aimed at supporting seamless
mobility between two ARs or FAs that provide access to a mobile node.
Approaches toward a CT framework are well described in [8] [9].
Conceptually, CT can take place before, during, or after handover.
Exactly when and how CT takes place is highly dependent on the type of
context being transferred. 

Satish et Al                                       [Page 6]
Internet Draft        Optimized IP Mobility...       Feb 2002


L2 triggers are used to initiate the context transfer operation. Early
notification of handovers is essential to having sufficient time to
complete the required protocol signaling. Also link establishment
trigger can be used for activating the state related to a context.

L2 handoff execution trigger can be used to achieve better L3 handover
with sufficient time for CT, which in the conventional case can become
an overhead on the L3 handover time. 

4.4. L2 Triggers and Candidate access router discovery
Candidate access router discovery is an important issue for fast handoff
initiation [10]. L2 triggers are used to initiate the Candidate access
router discovery. An L2 decision handoff notification with the decision
information (which carries the domain address to which the handover has
to occur) can allow L3 handover to proceed with out the CAR discovery
process. An L2 initiation trigger can be used as an initiation for CAR
discovery operation. 

5.0 The L2 Triggers

L2 triggers are defined in table 1 based on the L2 handover
decomposition, which the underlying systems are required to implement.
 
The description for a trigger contains the trigger name, the L2 handover
event causing the trigger to fire, what entities receive the trigger,
and parameters, if any. The recipient is qualified by the IP mobility
protocol in which the recipient plays a role. If the recipient does not
have AP functionality 
(i.e., the recipient does not have an interface directly on the wireless
link), the trigger information must be conveyed from the AP where it
occurs to the recipient by an L2 or L3 protocol.

The Source trigger, the target trigger and the Mobile trigger as 
specified in [11] can be indicated according to the L2 handoff 
decomposition provided above. This only provides implementation 
flexibility for a host of handoff causes as listed in the handoff 
initiation section above.

Satish et Al                                       [Page 8]
Internet Draft        Optimized IP Mobility...       Feb 2002


When a source trigger or target trigger is not followed by a link up or
down trigger, this sequence of events can be interpreted as an
indication of a failed handover. The time interval between the 
initiation (for the  cases of MN, Source and target trigger) and the
final execution can be used for meaningful CAR discovery, CT and fast
handoff completion. 


6.0 Using L2 Triggers in combination with other triggers

In future wireless networks L2 handoff causes can be very many. In 
such a scenario it is always advantageous to provide as elaborate an 
L2 trigger as possible. For example the time interval between an L2 
initiation trigger to the decision trigger is large such a time can 
be used by the MN for example to do a CAR discovery for itself.

While the L2 triggers as described in [11] seems aimed at being used 
as the primary triggers to achieve fast handoff, it is visualized that
the L2 triggers will be used in combination with a host of other 
triggers example from L3 location triggers [12] to application level 
triggers. As such it is asserted in this draft that the L2 triggers 
will have to be as comprehensive as possible with as much possible
generic decomposition as can be possible.
