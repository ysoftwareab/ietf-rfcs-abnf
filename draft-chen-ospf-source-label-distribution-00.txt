            Extensions to OSPF for Source Label Distribution
              draft-chen-ospf-source-label-distribution-00

Abstract

   An MPLS Source Label (SL) is defined to identify a node that is (one
   of) the ingress LSRs to a specific LSP.  This document defines
   extensions to OSPF protocol for distribution of the mapping of an
   MPLS Source Label to an specific LSR.  Therefore, the egress and
   intermediate LSRs can determine from which LSR an MPLS packet is
   sent.

   This document also defines OSPF extensions to advertise the Source
   Label Capability (SLC) of each LSR that indicates whether an LSR can
   process the Source Label.  With the SLC, an ingress LSR can determine
   whether it is allowed to insert a Source Label into the label stack
   for a specific LSP.

1.  Introduction

   The MPLS Source Label is defined in [I-D.chen-mpls-source-label], it
   is used to identify (one of) the ingress LSR(s) of an LSP.  To
   identify from where an MPLS packet is sent, a pure Source Label (SL)
   is not enough, it needs to know to which LSR a SL is correlated.
   Therefore, there needs a mechanism to distribute the mapping
   information between a SL and its correlated LSR.

   In addition, for an ingress LSR, before inserting a SL in the label
   stack of an LSP, it needs to know whether the egress LSR has the
   capability to process the SL, otherwise the packet will be dropped at
   the egress LSR.  The capability is called Source Label Capability
   (SLC).

   This document defines extensions to OSPF protocol to distribute SL to
   LSR mapping and advertise the SLC of each LSR.

2.  Extensions to OSPF

   The Source Label TLV is defined to distribute the Source Label to
   ingress LSR mapping information and the SLC.  No sub-TLV is currently
   defined for the Source Label TLV.

   The Source Label TLV is advertised in an OSPF Router Information (RI)
   [RFC4790] Link State Advertisement (LSA), it has the following
   format:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |              Type             |             Length            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                           Router ID                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |        Reserved       |           Source Label                |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                    Figure 1 - OSPF Source Label TLV format

   The value of Type field is TBD1.

   The Length field defines the length of the Reserved and Source Label
   in octets, the value is 4.

   The Source Label field contains the Source Label that identifies the
   advertising LSR.

3.  Elements of Procedure

   The Source Label TLV is carried in the OSPF Router Information (RI)
   LSAs that is defined in [RFC4790].  All the procedures that defined
   in [RFC4790] are inherited here.

   The flooding scope of the Source Label TLV can be either area local
   or entire OSPF domain.  The flooding scope is controlled by the
   Opaque LSA type in OSPFv2 [RFC2370] and by the S1 and S2 bits in
   OSPFv3 [RFC2740].  If the flooding scope is area local, the Source
   Label TLV MUST be carried within an OSPFv2 Type 10 RI LSA or within
   an OSPFv3 RI LSA with the S1 bit set and the S2 bit clear.  If the
   flooding scope is the entire IGP domain, the Source Label TLV MUST be
   carried within an OSPFv2 Type 11 RI LSA or within an OSPFv3 RI LSA
   with the S1 bit clear and the S2 bit set.

   The Source Label TLV is an optional TLV.  Upon receipt the TLV, a
   router will silently ignore the TLV as defined in [RFC4790] if it

   does not support it.  If Source Label TLV is not present that MUST be
   interpreted as signaling of non-support of SLC by the LSR.  Presence
   of a Source Label TLV MUST be interpreted as support of SLC by the
   LSR.  A Source Label TLV MUST appear only one time in an LSA.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new TLV code point for the Source Label
   TLV carried within the Router Information LSA.

   Type Value  TLV Name         Reference
   ----------  ---------------  --------------
   TBD1        Source Label     (this document)

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
