                  draft-ietf-iasa2-consolidated-upd-02

Abstract

   In 2018, the IETF began the transition to a new administrative
   structure and updated its IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)
   to a new "IASA 2.0" structure.  In addition to more substantive
   changes that are described in other documents, the transition to the
   2018 IETF Administrative Support structure changes several position
   titles and organizational relationships that are referenced
   elsewhere.  Rather than reissue those referencing documents
   individually, this specification provides updates to them and
   deprecates some now-obsolete documents to ensure that there is no
   confusion due to these changes.

1.  Introduction

   In 2018, the IETF began the transition to a new administrative
   structure, and updated its IETF Administrative Support Activity
   (IASA) to a new "IASA 2.0" structure [RFC-Struct].  Key IASA 2.0
   changes have been specified in a series of documents, including
   changes to the IETF Trust [RFC-trust-update], the rationale for it
   [RFC-trust-rationale], a new defining document for the IETF
   Administration LLC [LLC-Agreement] (informally called the "IETF LLC"
   or just "the LLC" in places in this document and elsewhere) and
   adjustments to the procedures for nominations and selections for
   relevant positions [RFC-7437bis].

   In addition to more substantive changes that are described in those
   and other documents, the IASA 2.0 structure changes several position

Internet-Draft         IASA2 Consolidated Updates          December 2018


   titles and organizational relationships that are referenced in other
   documents.  Rather than reissue those documents individually, this
   document provides a unified update to them.

   This document updates RFCs 2028, 2418, 3005, 3710, 5377, 6702, and
   7500 (citations in context below) to make those terminology and
   related changes.  For clarity, it also obsoletes RFCs 3716 and 3929
   which were Experimental or Informational documents that are no longer
   relevant (see Section 6).  The sections that follow identify the
   details of the relevant documents and the required changes.

   [[CREF1: Note in Draft: This document lists changes that the WG may
   choose to process as standalone replacement documents instead.  The
   relevant sections are provided to speed things along should it decide
   to not do that.]]

2.  Remove Text About the Connection Between the IAOC and IETF Trust

   Some documents that discuss the IETF Trust or its relationship to the
   community describe it, or the Trustees, in relation to the IAOC.
   That connection must be eliminated to reflect the new IASA 2.0
   structure.

   This document applies that change to the following:

   o  RFC 5377 [RFC5377], Advice to the Trustees of the IETF Trust on
      Rights to Be Granted in IETF Documents.  These changes require
      dropping "made up of the members of the IAOC [RFC4371]" after
      "board of trustees" in the first paragraph of Section 1 and "which
      is made up of the members of the IAOC, as described in [RFC4071]
      and [RFC4371]" in the first paragraph of Section 3.
      [[CREF2: RFC Editor please note that the bracketed strings above
      are quoted text, not references. ]]

3.  Replacement of IAOC with IETF Administration LLC

   All mentions of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC)
   that are not removed by the prior section, shall be updated and
   replaced by the IETF Administration LLC (IETF-LLC).  This is
   necessary because the IAOC is phased out under the IASA 2.0
   structure.

   This document applies that change to the following:

   o  RFC 4844 [RFC4844], the RFC Series and RFC Editor Sections 3.3,
      3.4, and 4.

Internet-Draft         IASA2 Consolidated Updates          December 2018


   o  RFC 7500 [RFC7500] Principles for Operation of Internet Assigned
      Numbers Authority (IANA) Registries, Section 3.4.  This means that
      the IETF LLC, the body responsible for IETF administrative and
      financial matters, maintains an SLA with the current registry
      operator, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
      (ICANN).  It also means that both the Internet Architecture Board
      (IAB) and the IETF LLC are accountable to the larger Internet
      community for the IANA registries.

4.  Where Appropriate, Replacement of the IETF Executive Director
    position with the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat

   Under the IASA 2.0 structure, most of the responsibilities of the
   former position of IETF Executive Director been assigned to a new
   position (or at least title) of Managing Director of the IETF
   Secretariat.  An "Executive Director" title is now associated with
   different, and largely new, responsibilities as an Officer of the
   IETF Administration LLC.  These changes are described in the
   description of the new structural arrangements [RFC-Struct].

   [[CREF3: Editorial comment/rant (JcK 20181114): Or at least they had
   better be clearly described there because, if they are not, this
   document is the wrong place to try to fix it.  I've done the best I
   could to combine my view of what this should say (which does not
   necessarily align with WG discussions) and Jason's (which presumably
   does, but had another issue or two).  Basically, from the standpoint
   of a clear understanding of the new roles and titles, taking the old
   roles of "IETF Executive Director" and "IETF Administrative Director"
   and renaming the Secretariat management part of the former role to
   "Managing Director, IETF Secretariat" would have been a little
   confusing because the old "IETF Executive Director" position had
   functions that were not inherently limited to the Secretariat
   function as the IETF has understood it.  But then taking some of the
   IAD functions and calling them "Executive Director" (without "IETF",
   but the term with "IETF" is still present in older documents that the
   WG has concluded it doesn't need to update and in some more recent
   sloppy usage) while distributing other IAD functions to the
   Secretariat is a recipe for complete confusion... and I've seen
   messages in which several people who have been active in the WG
   appear to be confused.  I accept Alissa's judgment that it is too
   late to change this, or at least the association of the "Executive
   Director" title with that LLC function, but suggest we need to be
   _very_ careful -- much more careful than we have apparently been so
   far -- about good-quality explanations and absolute consistency about
   terminology. ]]

   This document applies that change to the following:

Internet-Draft         IASA2 Consolidated Updates          December 2018


   o  RFC 2028, The Organizations Involved in the IETF Standards Process
      [RFC2028], Section 3.3.
      [[CREF4: Editorial note (JcK 20181115) Jason suggested somewhat
      different text, specifically "This means that the administrative
      functions necessary to support the activities of the IETF are
      performed by a Secretariat, led by the Managing Director, IETF
      Secretariat, and consisting of his or her staff in the IETF
      Secretariat."  I don't think "This" (the change) means any such
      thing because 2028 fairly clearly establishes the administrative
      function role of the Secretariat and its staff.  All this change
      does is what is described in the first paragraph of this section,
      i.e., switch titles, so the additional attempted explanation is
      unnecessary and likely to be confusing.  A similar change was
      proposed for the description of the RFC 2418 change below.  The WG
      should decide what it wants.]]

   o  RFC 2418, IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures [RFC2418]

   o  RFC 3710, An IESG Charter, Section 2[RFC3710].

   o  RFC 6702, Promoting Compliance with Intellectual Property Rights
      (IPR) Disclosure Rules, Section 5 [RFC6702].

   Note that the current description of the Internet Standards Process
   [RFC2026] does not require an update by this document for this
   purpose because the reference to the IETF Executive Director in RFC
   2026 was replaced by a document that precedes the current effort
   [RFC3979] and that was, in turn, obsoleted by RFC 8179 [RFC8179].

   [[CREF5: Note in Draft: Bob Hinden's note of November 10, 2018 11:37
   +0900 indicates that RFC4844 should continue to reference the IETF
   Executive Director.]]

5.  Remove the IETF Executive Director as an Option

   In a few cases, it is no longer appropriate for either the Managing
   Director, IETF Secretariat (former IETF Executive Director position)
   or the new IETF Executive Director (for the LLC) to perform a
   particular historical function.  The relevant documents are updated
   to remove the IETF Executive Director from the list of people with
   specific responsibilities or authority.  Those documents will not be
   updated to use "Managing Director, IETF Secretariat" but, instead,
   the mention of the position will simply be dropped.

   This document applies that change to the following:

   o  RFC 3005, IETF Discussion List Charter [RFC3005], section titled
      "Charter for the IETF Discussion List".  This document is modified

Internet-Draft         IASA2 Consolidated Updates          December 2018


      to remove the authorization for the IETF Executive Director to
      restrict people from posting, etc.

6.  Deprecated Documents

   The IASA2 Working Group has also identified several RFCs that no
   longer apply as a result of the change to the new IASA 2.0 structure.
   The result is that several informational, experimental, or other RFCs
   can be deprecated.

   This document deprecates the following:

   o  RFC 3929 [RFC3929], which touches on aspects of the administration
      of the IETF, such as mentioning the IETF Executive Director.  It
      dates to 2004 and is experimental.

   o  RFC 3979 [RFC3979], that is updated by [RFC8179], which corrects
      mentions of the IETF Executive Director to the IETF Secretariat.

   o  RFC 4633 [RFC4633], which is an experimental document that refers
      to IETF Executive Director.  It describes a 2006 experiment that
      ran for 18 months.

   o  RFC 4879 [RFC4879], that is updated by [RFC8179], which corrects
      mentions of the IETF Executive Director to the IETF Secretariat.

   It is also recommended that the above documents be reclassified to
   Historic to further reduce the risk of any confusion.

7.  Acknowledgments

   Brian Carpenter's careful checking and identification of documents
   that did, and did not, require consideration was essential to the
   draft in its current form.

8.  Contributors

   Jason Livingood did the hard work of identifying the documents that
   required updating and supplied considerable text used in this
   document.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [[CREF6: RFC Editor: Please remove this section before publication.]]

   This memo includes no requests to or actions for IANA.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   RFC Editor: Please remove this appendix before publication.

A.1.  Changes from version -00 (2018-11-15) to -01

   o  Removed RFCs 3979 and 4879 from the "obsoletes" list because they
      had already been obsoleted (by 8179).  It also removes RFC 8179
      from the "updates" list because 8179 uses "IETF Secretariat"
      terminology rather than "IETF Executive Director".

      [[CREF7: Note in Draft: That suggests an idea which might
      considerably mitigate the name confusion issue: Instead of
      singling out the Managing Director of the Secretariat as a named
      individual, perhaps we should be referring to the Secretariat
      itself, leaving the contact point or address up to them as an
      internal administrative matter.  Just a thought. --JcK]]

   o  Added text to explain why RFC 2026 is not on the hit list.

   o  Added an acknowledgment to Brian Carpenter.  If he catches another

Internet-Draft         IASA2 Consolidated Updates          December 2018


A.2.  Changes from version -01 (dated 2018-12-06 but posted 2012-12-07)
      to -02

   I accidentally omitted RFC 4844 from the document header "updates"
   list in Version 01 and noticed that in response to an unrelated
   question almost immediately after posting.  The correction seemed
   important enough to justify almost immediate re-posting.  Changes are
   only that header, the document file name, and the date.  --JcK
