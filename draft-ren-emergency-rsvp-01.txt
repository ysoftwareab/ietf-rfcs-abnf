Abstract 
    
   Some applications require the ability to provide an elevated 
   probability of session establishment to specific sessions in times of 
   network congestion. When supported over the Internet Protocol suite, 
   this may be facilitated through a network layer admission control 
   solution that supports prioritized access to resources (e.g., 
   bandwidth).  These resources may be explicitly set aside for 
   prioritized sessions, or may be shared with other sessions.  This 
   document specifies extensions to the Resource reSerVation Protocol 
   (RSVP) that can be used to support such an admission priority 
   capability at the network layer.  
    
   Based on current security concerns, these extensions are targeting 
   applicability within a single domain.

1. Introduction 
    
   Some applications require the ability to provide an elevated 
   probability of session establishment to specific sessions in times of 
   network congestion. 
    
   Solutions to meet this requirement for elevated session establishment 
   probability may involve session layer capabilities prioritizing 
   access to resources controlled by the session control function.  As 
   an example, entities involved in session control (such as SIP user 
   agents, when the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261], is the 
   session control protocol in use) can influence their treatment of 
   session establishment requests (such as SIP requests).  This may 
   include the ability to "queue" session establishment requests when 
   those can not be immediately honored (in some cases with the notion 
   of "bumping", or "displacement", of less important session 
   establishment requests from that queue).  It may include additional 
   mechanisms such as exemption from certain network management  
   controls, and alternate routing. 
    
   Solutions to meet the requirement for elevated session establishment 
   probability may also take advantage of network layer admission 
   control mechanisms supporting admission priority.  Networks usually 
   have engineered capacity limits that characterize the maximum load 
   that can be handled (say, on any given link) for a class of traffic 
   while satisfying the quality of service requirements of that traffic 
   class.  Admission priority may involve setting aside some network 
   resources (e.g. bandwidth) out of the engineered capacity limits for 
   the prioritized sessions only.  Or alternatively, it may involve 
   allowing the prioritized sessions to seize additional resources 
   beyond the engineered capacity limits applied to normal sessions. 
   This document specifies the necessary extensions to support such 
   admission priority when network layer admission control is performed 
   using the Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP) ([RFC2205]). 
    
   [RFC3181] specifies the Signaled Preemption Priority Policy Element 
   that can be signaled in RSVP so that network node may take into 
   account this policy element in order to preempt some previously

   admitted low priority sessions in order to make room for a newer, 
   higher priority session.  In contrast, this document specifies new 
   RSVP extensions to increase the probability of session establishment 
   without preemption of existing sessions.  This is achieved by 
   engineered capacity techniques in the form of bandwidth allocation 
   models.  In particular this document specifies two new RSVP Policy 
   Elements allowing the admission priority to be conveyed inside RSVP 
   signaling messages so that RSVP nodes can enforce selective bandwidth 
   admission control decision based on the session admission priority. 
   Appendix A of this document also provides examples of bandwidth 
   allocation models which can be used by RSVP-routers to enforce such 
   admission priority on every link.  A given reservation may be 
   signaled with the admission priority extensions specified in the 
   present document, with the preemption priority specified in [RFC3181] 
   or with both. 
    
   Based on current security concerns, these extensions are targeting 
   applicability within a single domain. 
    
    
1.1 Terminology 
    
   This document assumes the terminology defined in [RFC2753].  For 
   convenience, the definition of a few key terms is repeated here: 
    
   o  Policy Decision Point (PDP): The point where policy decisions are 
   made. 
    
   o  Local Policy Decision Point (LPDP): PDP local to the network 
   element. 
    
   o  Policy Enforcement Point (PEP): The point where the policy 
   decisions are actually enforced. 
    
   o  Policy Ignorant Node (PIN): A network element that does not 
   explicitly support policy control using the mechanisms defined in 
   [RFC2753]. 
    
    
2. Requirements Language 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
    
3. Overview of RSVP extensions and Operations 
    
   Let us consider the case where a session requires elevated 
   probability of establishment, and more specifically that the

   preference to be granted to this session is in terms of network layer 
   "admission priority" (as opposed to preference granted through 
   preemption of existing sessions).  By "admission priority" we mean 
   allowing the priority session to seize network layer resources from 
   the engineered capacity that has been set-aside for priority sessions 
   (and not made available to normal sessions), or alternatively 
   allowing the priority session to seize additional resources beyond 
   the engineered capacity limits applied to normal sessions. 
    
   Session establishment can be conditioned to resource-based and 
   policy-based network layer admission control achieved via RSVP 
   signaling.  In the case where the session control protocol is SIP, 
   the use of RSVP-based admission control in conjunction with SIP is 
   specified in [RFC3312]. 
    
   Devices involved in the session establishment are expected to be 
   aware of the application-level priority requirements of prioritized 
   sessions.  For example, considering the case where the session 
   control protocol is SIP, the SIP user agents may be made aware of the 
   resource priority requirements of a given session using the 
   "Resource-Priority" header mechanism specified in [RFC4412].  The 
   end-devices involved in the upper-layer session establishment simply 
   need to copy the application-level resource priority requirements 
   (e.g. as communicated in SIP "Resource-Priority" header) inside the 
   new RSVP Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element defined 
   in this document. 
    
   Conveying the application-level resource priority requirements inside 
   the RSVP message allows this application level requirement to be 
   mapped/remapped into a different RSVP "admission priority" at a 
   policy boundary based on the policy applicable in that policy area. 
   In a typical model (see [RFC2753]) where PDPs control PEPs at the 
   periphery of the policy area (e.g. on the first hop router), PDPs 
   would interpret the RSVP Application-Level Resource Priority Policy 
   Element and map the requirement of the prioritized session into an 
   RSVP "admission priority" level.  Then, PDPs would convey this 
   information inside the new Admission Priority Policy Element defined 
   in this document.  This way, the RSVP admission priority can be 
   communicated to downstream PEPs (i.e.  RSVP Routers) of the same 
   policy domain, which have LPDPs but no controlling PDP.  In turn, 
   this means the necessary RSVP Admission priority can be enforced at 
   every RSVP hop, including all the (possibly many) hops which do not 
   have any understanding of Application-Level Resource Priority 
   semantics.  It is not expected that the RSVP Application-Level 
   Resource Priority Header Policy Element would be taken into account 
   at RSVP-hops within a given policy area.  It is expected to be used 
   at policy area boundaries only in order to set/reset the RSVP 
   Admission Priority Policy Element.

   Remapping by PDPs of the Admission Priority Policy Element from the 
   Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element may also be used 
   at boundaries with other signaling protocols, such as the NSIS 
   Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) for QoS Signaling ([RFC5974]). 
    
   As can be observed, the framework described above for mapping/ 
   remapping application level resource priority requirements into an 
   RSVP admission priority can also be used together with [RFC3181] for 
   mapping/remapping application level resource priority requirements 
   into an RSVP preemption priority (when preemption is indeed deemed 
   necessary by the priotized session handling policy).  In that case, 
   when processing the RSVP Application-Level Resource Priority Policy 
   Element, the PDPs at policy boundaries (or between various QoS 
   signaling protocols) can map it into an RSVP "preemption priority" 
   information.  This Preemption priority information comprises a setup 
   preemption level and a defending preemption priority level that can 
   then be encoded inside the Preemption Priority Policy Element of 
   [RFC3181]. 
    
   Appendix B provides examples of various hypothetical policies for 
   prioritized session handling, some of them involving admission 
   priority, some of them involving both admission priority and 
   preemption priority.  Appendix B also identifies how the Application- 
   Level Resource Priority needs to be mapped into RSVP policy elements 
   by the PDPs to realize these policies. 
    
3.1 Operations of Admission Priority 
    
   The RSVP Admission Priority policy element defined in this document 
   allows admission bandwidth to be allocated preferentially to 
   prioritized sessions.  Multiple models of bandwidth allocation MAY be 
   used to that end. 
    
   A number of bandwidth allocation models have been defined in the IETF 
   for allocation of bandwidth across different classes of traffic 
   trunks in the context of Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering. 
   Those include the Maximum Allocation Model (MAM) defined in  
   [RFC4125], the Russian Dolls Model (RDM) specified in [RFC4127] and 
   the Maximum Allocation model with Reservation (MAR) defined in 
   [RFC4126].  These same models MAY however be applied for allocation 
   of bandwidth across different levels of admission priority as defined 
   in this document.  Appendix A provides an illustration of how these 
   bandwidth allocation models can be applied for such purposes and also 
   introduces an additional bandwidth allocation model that we term the 
   Priority Bypass Model (PrBM).  It is important to note that the 
   models described and illustrated in Appendix A are only informative 
   and do not represent a recommended course of action.

   We can see in these examples how the RSVP Admission Priority can be 
   used by RSVP routers to influence their admission control decision 
   (for example by determining which bandwidth pool is to be used by 
   RSVP for performing its bandwidth allocation) and therefore to 
   increase the probability of reservation establishment.  In turn, this 
   increases the probability of application level session establishment 
   for the corresponding session. 
    
4. New Policy Elements 
    
   The Framework document for policy-based admission control [RFC2753] 
   describes the various components that participate in policy decision 
   making (i.e., PDP, PEP and LPDP). 
    
   As described in Section 3 of the present document, the Application- 
   Level Resource Priority Policy Element and the Admission Priority 
   Policy Element serve different roles in this framework: 
    
   o  the Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element conveys 
   application level information and is processed by PDPs 
    
   o  the emphasis of Admission Priority Policy Element is to be simple, 
   stateless, and light-weight such that it can be processed internally 
   within a node's LPDP.  It can then be enforced internally within a 
   node's PEP.  It is set by PDPs based on processing of the 
   Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element. 
    
   [RFC2750] defines extensions for supporting generic policy based 
   admission control in RSVP.  These extensions include the standard 
   format of POLICY_DATA objects and a description of RSVP handling of 
   policy events. 
    
   The POLICY_DATA object contains one or more of Policy Elements, each 
   representing a different (and perhaps orthogonal) policy.  As an 
   example, [RFC3181] specifies the Preemption Priority Policy Element. 
   This document defines two new Policy Elements called: 
    
   o  the Admission Priority Policy Element 
    
   o  the Application-Level Resource Priority Policy Element 
    
    
4.1 Admission Priority Policy Element 
    
   The format of the Admission Priority policy element is as shown in 
   Figure 1:

         to network bandwidth in order to provide higher probability of 
         session completion to selected flows.  Higher values represent 
         higher priority.  A given Admission Priority is encoded in this 
         information element using the same value as when encoded in the 
         "Admission Priority" field of the "Admission Priority" 
         parameter defined in [RFC5975].  In other words, a given value 
         inside the Admission Priority information element defined in 
         the present document or inside the [RFC5975] Admission Priority 
         field refers to the same admission priority.  Bandwidth 
         allocation models such as those described in Appendix A are to 
         be used by the RSVP router to achieve such increased 
         probability of session establishment. The admission priority 
         value effectively indicates which bandwidth constraint(s) of 
         the bandwidth constraint model in Note that the Admission 
         Priority Policy Element does NOT indicate that this RSVP 
         reservation is to preempt any other RSVP reservation. If a 
         priority session justifies both admission priority and 
         preemption priority, the corresponding RSVP reservation needs 
         to carry both an Admission Priority Policy Element and a 
         Preemption Priority Policy Element.  The Admission Priority and 
         Preemption Priority are handled by LPDPs and PEPs as separate 
         mechanisms.  They can be used one without the other, or they 
         can be used both in combination. 
    
    

4.1.1  Admission Priority Merging Rules 
    
   This section discusses alternatives for dealing with RSVP admission 
   priority in case of merging of reservations.  As merging applies to 
   multicast, this section also applies to multicast sessions. 
    
   The rules for merging Admission Priority Policy Elements are defined 
   by the value encoded inside the Merge Strategy field in accordance 
   with the corresponding IANA registry.  The merge strategies (and 
   associated values) defined by the present document are the same as 
   those defined in [RFC3181] for merging Preemption Priority Policy 
   Elements (see "IANA Considerations" section). 
    
   The only difference with [RFC3181] is that this document does not 
   recommend any merge strategies for Admission Priority, while  
   [RFC3181] recommends the first of these merge strategies for 
   Preemption Priority.  Note that with the Admission Priority (as is 
   the case with the Preemption Priority), "Take highest priority" 
   translates into "take the highest numerical value".

4.2.1  Application-Level Resource Priority Modifying and Merging Rules 
    
   When POLICY_DATA objects are protected by integrity, LPDPs should not 
   attempt to modify them.  They MUST be forwarded as-is to ensure their 
   security envelope is not invalidated. 
    
   In case of multicast, when POLICY_DATA objects are not protected by 
   integrity, LPDPs MAY merge incoming Application-Level Resource 
   Priority elements to reduce their size and number.  When they do 
   merge those, LPDPs MUST do so according to the following rule: 
    
   o  The ALRP List in the outgoing APP_RESOURCE_PRI element MUST 
      contain all the ALRPs appearing in the ALRP List of an incoming 
      APP_RESOURCE_PRI element.  A given ALRP MUST NOT appear more than 
      once.  In other words, the outgoing ALRP List is the union of the 
      incoming ALRP Lists that are merged. 
    
   As merging applies to Multicast, this rule also applies to Multicast 
   sessions. 
    
4.3 Default Handling 
    
   As specified in section 4.2 of [RFC2750], Policy Ignorant Nodes  
   (PINs) implement a default handling of POLICY_DATA objects ensuring 
   that those objects can traverse PIN nodes in transit from one PEP to 
   another.  This applies to the situations where POLICY_DATA objects 
   contain the Admission Priority Policy Element and the ALRP Policy 
   Element specified in this document, so that those can traverse PIN 
   nodes. 
    
 
 
Wang                   Expires  January 6,2012              [Page 11] 
 Internet-Draft              emergency-rsvp                   July 2011 
 
 
   Section 4.2 of [RFC2750] also defines a similar default behavior for 
   policy-capable nodes that do not recognized a particular Policy 
   Element.  This applies to the Admission Priority Policy Element and 
   the ALRP Policy Element specified in this document, so that those can 
   traverse policy-capable nodes that do not support thes extensions 
   defined in the present document. 
    
    
5. 
   Security Considerations 
    
   As this document defines extensions to RSVP, the security 
   considerations of RSVP apply.  Those are discussed in [RFC2205], 
   [RFC4230] and [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-security-groupkeying].  Approaches 
   for addressing those concerns are discussed further below. 
    
   A subset of RSVP messages are signaled with the Router Alert Option 
   (RAO)([RFC2113],[RFC2711]).  The security aspects and common 
   practices around the use of the current IP Router Alert option and 
   consequences on the use of IP Router Alert by applications such as 
   RSVP are discussed in [I-D.rahman-rtg-router-alert-considerations]. 
   As mentioned earlier, based on current security concerns (some of 
   them associated with RAO), the extensions defined in this document 
   are targeting applicability within a single domain. 
    
   The ADMISSION_PRI and APP_RESOURCE_PRI Policy Elements defined in 
   this document are signaled by RSVP through encapsulation in a Policy 
   Data object as defined in [RFC2750].  Therefore, like any other 
   Policy Elements, their integrity can be protected as discussed in 
   section 6 of [RFC2750] by two optional security mechanisms.  The 
   first mechanism relies on RSVP Authentication as specified in 
   [RFC2747] and [RFC3097] to provide a chain of trust when all RSVP 
   nodes are policy capable.  With this mechanism, the INTEGRITY object 
   is carried inside RSVP messages.  The second mechanism relies on the 
   INTEGRITY object within the POLICY_DATA object to guarantee integrity 
   between RSVP Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) that are not RSVP 
   neighbors. 
    
    
5.1 Use of RSVP Authentication between RSVP neighbors 
    
   RSVP authentication can be used between RSVP neighbors that are 
   policy capable.  RSVP Authentication (defined in [RFC2747] and 
   [RFC3097]) SHOULD be supported by an implementation of the present 
   document. 
    
      With RSVP authentication, the RSVP neighbors use shared keys to 
   compute the cryptographic signature of the RSVP message. [I-D.ietf-
   tsvwg-rsvp-security-groupkeying] discusses key types, key 
   provisioning methods as well as their respective applicability. 
 
 
Wang                   Expires  January 6,2012              [Page 12] 
 Internet-Draft              emergency-rsvp                   July 2011 
 
 
    
    
5.2 Use of INTEGRITY object within the POLICY_DATA object 
    
   The INTEGRITY object within the POLICY_DATA object can be used to 
   guarantee integrity between non-neighboring RSVP PEPs.  This is 
   useful only when some RSVP nodes are Policy Ignorant Nodes (PINs). 
   The INTEGRITY object within the POLICY_DATA object MAY be supported 
   by an implementation of teh present document. 
    
   Details for computation of the content of the INTEGRITY object can be 
   found in Appendix B of [RFC2750].  This states that the Policy 
   Decision Point (PDP), at its discretion, and based on destination 
   PEP/PDP or other criteria, selects an Authentication Key and the hash 
   algorithm to be used.  Keys to be used between PDPs can be 
   distributed manually or via standard key management protocol for 
   secure key distribution. 
    
   Note that where non-RSVP hops may exist in between RSVP hops, as well 
   as where RSVP capable Policy Ignorant Nodes (PINs) may exist in 
   between PEPs, it may be difficult for the PDP to determine what is 
   the destination PDP for a POLICY_DATA object contained in some RSVP 
   messages (such as a Path message).  This is because in those cases 
   the next PEP is not known at the time of forwarding the message.  In 
   this situation, key shared across multiple PDPs may be used.  This is 
   conceptually similar to the use of key shared across multiple RSVP 
   neighbors discussed in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rsvp-security-groupkeying]. We 
   observe also that this issue may not exist in some deployment 
   scenarios where a single (or low number of) PDP is used to control 
   all the PEPs of a region (such as an administrative domain).  In such 
   scenarios, it may be easy for a PDP to determine what is the next hop 
   PDP, even when the next hop PEP is not known, simply by determining 
   what is the next region that will be traversed (say based on the 
   destination address). 
    
    
6. IANA Considerations 
    
   As specified in [RFC2750], Standard RSVP Policy Elements (P-type 
   values) are to be assigned by IANA as per "IETF Consensus" policy 
   following the policies outlined in [RFC5226]. 
    
   IANA needs to allocate two P-Types from the Standard RSVP Policy 
   Element range: 
    
   o  one P-Type to the Admission Priority Policy Element 
    
   o  one P-Type to the Application-Level Resource Priority Policy 
      Element. 
 
 
Wang                   Expires  January 6,2012              [Page 13] 
 Internet-Draft              emergency-rsvp                   July 2011 
 
 
    
   In section 3.1, the present document defines a Merge Strategy field 
   inside the Admission Priority policy element.  IANA needs to create a 
   registry for this field and allocate the following values: 
    
   o  1: Take priority of highest QoS 
    
   o  2: Take highest priority 
    
   o  3: Force Error on heterogeneous merge 
    
   Following the policies outlined in [RFC5226], numbers in the range 4-
   127 are allocated according to the "IETF Review" policy, numbers in 
   the range 128-240 as "First Come First Served" and numbers between 
   241-255 are reserved for "Private Use".  Value 0 is Reserved (for 
   consistency with [RFC3181] Merge Strategy values). 
    
   In section 3.1, the present document defines an Error Code field 
   inside the Admission Priority policy element.  IANA needs to create a 
   registry for this field and allocate the following values: 
    
   o  0: NO_ERROR Value used for regular ADMISSION_PRI elements 
    
   o  2: HETEROGENEOUS This element encountered heterogeneous merge 
    
   Following the policies outlined in [RFC5226], numbers in the range 3-
   127 are allocated according to the "IETF Review" policy, numbers in 
   the range 128-240 as "First Come First Served" and numbers between 
   241-255 are reserved for "Private Use".  Value 1 is Reserved (for 
   consistency with [RFC3181] Error Code values). 
    
   The present document defines an ALRP Namespace field in section 3.2 
   that contains a numerical value identifying the namespace of the 
   application-level resource priority.  The IANA already maintains the 
   Resource-Priority Namespaces registry (under the SIP Parameters) 
   listing all such namespace.  However, that registry does not 
   currently allocate a numerical value to each namespace.  Hence, this 
   document requests the IANA to extend the Resource-Priority Namespaces 
   registry in the following ways: 
    
   o  a new column should be added to the registry 
    
   o  the title of the new column should be "Namespace Numerical Value 
         *" 
    
   o  in the Legend, add a line saying "Namespace Numerical Value = the 
      unique numerical value identifying the namespace"

 Internet-Draft              emergency-rsvp                   July 2011 
 
 
   o  add a line at the bottom of the registry stating the following  
      "* : [RFCXXX] " where XXX is the RFC number of the present 
      document 
    
   o  allocate an actual numerical value to each namespace in the 
      registry and state that value in the new "Namespace numerical 
      Value *" column. 
    
   A numerical value should be allocated immediately by IANA to all 
   existing namespace.  Then, in the future, IANA should automatically 
   allocate a numerical value to any new namespace added to the  
   registry. 
    
   The present document defines an ALRP Priority field in section 3.2 
   that contains a numerical value identifying the actual application- 
   level resource priority within the application-level resource 
   priority namespace.  The IANA already maintains the Resource-Priority 
   Priority-values registry (under the SIP Parameters) listing all such 
   priorities.  However, that registry does not currently allocate a 
   numerical value to each priority-value.  Hence, this document 
   requests the IANA to extend the Resource-Priority Priority-Values 
   registry in the following ways: 
    
   o  for each namespace, the registry should be structured with two 
      columns 
    
   o  the title of the first column should read "Priority Values (least 
      to greatest)" 
    
   o  the first column should list all the values currently defined in 
      the registry (e.g. for the drsn namespace: "routine", "priority", 
      "immediate", "flash", "flash-override", "flash-override-override" 
      for the drsn namespace) 
    
   o  the title of the second column should read "Priority Numerical 
      Value *" 
    
   o  At the bottom of the registry, add a "Legend" with a line saying 
      "Priority Numerical Value = the unique numerical value identifying 
      the priority within a namespace" 
    
   o  add a line at the bottom of the registry stating the following  
      "* : [RFCXXX] " where XXX is the RFC number of the present 
      document 
    
   o  allocate an actual numerical value to each and state that value in 
      the new "Priority Numerical Value *" column.

 Internet-Draft              emergency-rsvp                   July 2011 
 
 
   A numerical value should be allocated immediately by IANA to all 
   existing priority.  Then, in the future, IANA should automatically 
   allocate a numerical value to any new namespace added to the  
   registry.  The numerical value must be unique within each namespace. 
   For the initial allocation, within each namespace, values should be 
   allocated in decreasing order ending with 0 (so that the greatest 
   priority is always allocated value 0).  For example, in the drsn 
   namespace, "routine" would be allocated numerical value 5 and "flash- 
   override-override" would be allocated numerical value 0.

Appendix A.  Examples of Bandwidth Allocation Model for Admission 
Priority 
    
   Sections A.1 and A.2 respectively illustrate how the Maximum   
   Allocation Model (MAM) ([RFC4125]) and the Russian Dolls Model 
   (RDM)([RFC4127]) can be used for support of admission priority.  
   TheMaximum Allocation model with Reservation (MAR) ([RFC4126]) 
   couldalso be used in a similar manner for support of admission 
   priority.Section A.3 illustrates how a simple "Priority Bypass Model" 
   can alsobe used for support of admission priority. 
    
   For simplicity, operations with only a single "priority" level   
   (beyond non-priority) are illustrated here; However, the reader will   
   appreciate that operations with multiple priority levels can easily   
   be supported with these models.

A.1.  Admission Priority with Maximum Allocation Model (MAM) 
    
   This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a   
   Maximum Allocation Model (MAM) is used for bandwidth allocation 
   across non-priority traffic and priority traffic. A property of the 
   Maximum Allocation Model is that priority traffic can not use more 
   than the bandwidth made available to priority traffic (even if the 
   non-priority traffic is not using all of the bandwidth available for 
   it).

                    Figure 4: MAM Bandwidth Allocation 
    
   Figure 4 shows a link within a routed network conforming to this 
   document. On this link are two amounts of bandwidth available to two 
   types of traffic: non-priority and priority. 
    
   If the non-priority traffic load reaches the maximum bandwidth 
   available for non-priority, no additional non-priority sessions can 
   be accepted even if the bandwidth reserved for priority traffic is 
   not currently fully utilized. 
    
   With the Maximum Allocation Model, in the case where the priority 
   load reaches the maximum bandwidth reserved for priority sessions, no 
   additional priority sessions can be accepted. 
    
   As illustrated in Figure 4, an operator may map the MAM model on to 
   the Engineered Capacity limits according to different policies.  
   Atone extreme, where the proportion of priority traffic is 
   reliablyknown to be fairly small at all times and where there may be 
   some safety margin factored in the engineered capacity limits, the 
   operator may decide to configure the bandwidth available for non-
   priority use to the full engineered capacity limits; effectively 
   allowing the priority traffic to ride within the safety margin of 
   this engineered capacity.  This policy can be seen as an economically 
   attractive approach as all of the engineered capacity is made 
   available to non-priority sessions.  This policy is illustrated as  
   (1) in Figure 4.  As an example, if the engineered capacity limit on 
   a given link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth available 
   to non-priority traffic to X, and the bandwidth available to priority 
   traffic to 5% of X. At the other extreme, where the proportion of 
   priority traffic may be significant at times and the engineered 
   capacity limits are very tight, the operator may decide to configure 
   the bandwidth available to non-priority traffic and the bandwidth

   available to priority traffic such that their sum is equal to the 
   engineered capacity limits.  This guarantees that the total load   
   across non-priority and priority traffic is always below the   
   engineered capacity and, in turn, guarantees there will never be any   
   QoS degradation.  However, this policy is less attractive   
   economically as it prevents non-priority sessions from using the full   
   engineered capacity, even when there is no or little priority load,   
   which is the majority of time.  This policy is illustrated as (3) in   
   Figure 4.  As an example, if the engineered capacity limit on a given   
   link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth available to non-   
   priority traffic to 95% of X, and the bandwidth available to priority   
   traffic to 5% of X. Of course, an operator may also strike a balance   
   anywhere in between these two approaches.  This policy is illustrated   
   as (2) in Figure 4. 
    
      Figure 5 shows some of the non-priority capacity of this link 
   being used.

A.2.  Admission Priority with Russian Dolls Model (RDM) 
    
   This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a 
   Russian Dolls Model (RDM) is used for bandwidth allocation across 
   non-priority traffic and priority traffic. A property of the Russian 
   Dolls Model is that priority traffic can use the bandwidth which is 
   not currently used by non-priority traffic. 
    
   As with the MAM model, an operator may map the RDM model onto the 
   Engineered Capacity limits according to different policies.  The 
   operator may decide to configure the bandwidth available for non-
   priority use to the full engineered capacity limits; As an example, 
   if the engineered capacity limit on a given link is X, the operator 
   may configure the bandwidth available to non-priority traffic to X, 
   and the bandwidth available to non-priority and priority traffic to 
   105% of X. 
    
   Alternatively, the operator may decide to configure the bandwidth 
   available to non-priority and priority traffic to the engineered 
   capacity limits; As an example, if the engineered capacity limit on a 
   given link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth available 
   to non-priority traffic to 95% of X, and the bandwidth available to 
   non-priority and priority traffic to X.

   Finally, the operator may decide to strike a balance in between. The 
   considerations presented for these policies in the previous section 
   in the MAM context are equally applicable to RDM. 
    
   Figure 9 shows the case where only some of the bandwidth available to 
   non-priority traffic is being used and a small amount of priority 
   traffic is in place.  In that situation both new non-priority 
   sessions and new priority sessions would be accepted.

A.3.  Admission Priority with Priority Bypass Model (PrBM) 
    
   This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a   
   simple Priority Bypass Model (PrBM) is used for bandwidth allocation   
   across non-priority traffic and priority traffic.  With the Priority   
   Bypass Model, non-priority traffic is subject to resource based 
   admission control while priority traffic simply bypasses the resource   
   based admission control.  In other words: 
    
   o  when a non-priority session arrives, this session is subject to      
   bandwidth admission control and is accepted if the current total      
   load (aggregate over non-priority and priority traffic) is below      
   the engineered/allocated bandwidth. 
    
   o  when a priority session arrives, this session is admitted      
   regardless of the current load. 
    
   A property of this model is that a priority session is never   
   rejected. 
    
   The rationale for this simple scheme is that, in practice in some   
   networks: 
    
   o  the volume of priority sessions is very low for the vast majority 
   of time, so it may not be economical to completely set aside      
   bandwidth for priority sessions and preclude the utilization of      
   this bandwidth by normal sessions in normal situations 
    
   o  even in congestion periods where priority sessions may be more      
   heavily used, those always still represent a fairly small      
   proportion of the overall load which can be absorbed within the      
   safety margin of the engineered capacity limits.  Thus, even if      
   they are admitted beyond the engineered bandwidth threshold, they      
   are unlikely to result in noticeable QoS degradation. 
    
   As with the MAM and RDM model, an operator may map the Priority   
   Bypass model onto the Engineered Capacity limits according to   
   different policies.  The operator may decide to configure the   
   bandwidth limit for admission of non-priority traffic to the full   
   engineered capacity limits; As an example, if the engineered capacity   
   limit on a given link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth   
   limit for non-priority traffic to X. Alternatively, the operator may   
   decide to configure the bandwidth limit for non-priority traffic to   
   below the engineered capacity limits (so that the sum of the non-
   priority and priority traffic stays below the engineered capacity);

   As an example, if the engineered capacity limit on a given link is X,   
   the operator may configure the bandwidth limit for non-priority   
   traffic to 95% of X. Finally, the operator may decide to strike a   
   balance in between.  The considerations presented for these policies   
   in the previous sections in the MAM and RDM contexts are equally   
   applicable to the Priority Bypass Model. 
    
   Figure 13 illustrates the bandwidth allocation with the Priority   
   Bypass Model.

   This section illustrates operations of admission priority when a 
   Temporary Allocation Model (TAM) is used for bandwidth allocation 
   across non-priority traffic and priority traffic. According to the 
   characters of emergency services, burstiness and short duration, 
   there are two periods. One is the emergency period and the other is 
   non-emergency period. There are two ways to enter the emergency 
   period from non-emergency period:the trigger time and the emergency 
   session. 
    
   When there is no emergency session, if a non-emergency session 
   arrives, this session is subject to bandwidth admission control and 
   accepted if the current total load (aggregate over non-priority and 
   priority traffic) is below the engineered/allocated bandwidth. 
    
        Figure 17 shows all the bandwidth is available for non-priority 
   traffic in the non-emergency period and some amount of non-priority 
   load being used at this link.

   When one or more emergency service requests arrive at PEP or the time 
   for emergency period arrives (for example, the operator set the time 
   <9:00~11:00> for emergency period), the operator configure a certain 
   bandwidth available for emergency sessions, called emergency zone. If 
   non-priority session arrives, this session is rejected regardless of 
   the current load. If emergency session arrives, the session is 
   admitted in the emergency zone whatever the current load is. If the 
   new session is priority session, and the priority traffic load 
   reaches the maximum bandwidth available for priority, the session 
   will be rejected, or will be admitted.

   The same as the other bandwidth allocation models, an operator may 
   map the TAM model onto the Engineered Capacity limits according to 
   different policies. As an example, if the engineered capacity limit 
   on a given link is X, the operator may configure the bandwidth 
   available to non-priority traffic to 95% of X in the emergency  
   period. when a priority session(emergency service) arrives, this 
   session is admitted regardless of the current load. Finally,the 
   operator may decide to strike a balance in between. The 
   considerations presented for these policies in the MAM, RDM and PrBM 
   contexts are equally applicable to the Priority Bypass Model. 
           
   Figure 18 illustrates the bandwidth allocation with the Temporary 
   Allocation Model in the emergency periods. The operator set a certain 
   percent of the available bandwidth to be the emergency zone for the 
   emergency sessions. If the available bandwidth is not enough for the 
   emergency zone, the operator would tear some of the non-priority 
   sessions in order to get their bandwidth.

Appendix B.  Example Usages of RSVP Extensions 
    
   This section provides examples of how RSVP extensions defined in this   
   document can be used (in conjunctions with other RSVP functionality   
   and SIP functionality) to enforce different hypothetical policies for 
   handling prioritized sessions in a given administrative domain.  This

   Appendix does not provide additional specification.  It is only 
   included in this document for illustration purposes. 
    
   We assume an environment where SIP is used for session control and   
   RSVP is used for resource reservation. 
    
   We refer here to "Session Queuing" as the set of "session" layer   
   capabilities that may be implemented by SIP user agents to influence 
   their treatment of SIP requests.  This may include the ability to 
   "queue" session requests when those can not be immediately honored 
   (in some cases with the notion of "bumping", or "displacement", of 
   less important session requests from that queue).  It may include 
   additional mechanisms such as exemption from certain network 
   management controls, and alternate routing. 
    
   We only mention below the RSVP policy elements that are to be   
   enforced by PEPs.  It is assumed that these policy elements are set 
   at a policy area boundary by PDPs.  The Admission Priority and 
   Preemption Priority RSVP policy elements are set by PDPs as a result 
   of processing the Application Level Resource Priority Policy Element 
   (which is carried in RSVP messages). 
    
   If one wants to implement a prioritized service purely based on   
   Session Queueing, one can achieve this by signaling prioritized   
   sessions: 
    
   o  using "Resource-Priority" header in SIP 
    
   o  not using Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP 
    
   o  not using Preemption Policy Element in RSVP 
    
   If one wants to implement a prioritized service based on Session   
   Queuing and on "prioritized access to network layer resources", one 
   can achieve this by signaling prioritized sessions: 
    
   o  using "Resource-Priority" header in SIP 
    
   o  using Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP 
    
   o  not using Preemption Policy Element in RSVP 
    
   Establishment of prioritized sessions will not result in preemption   
   of any session.  Different bandwidth allocation models can be used to 
   offer different "prioritized access to network resources".  Just as 
   examples, this includes strict setting aside of capacity for 
   prioritized sessions as well as simple bypass of admission limits for 
   prioritized sessions.

   If one wants to implement a prioritized service based on Session   
   Queuing, on "prioritized access to network layer resources", and 
   ensures that (say) "Prioritized-1" sessions can preempt "Prioritized-
   2" sessions, but non-prioritized sessions are not affected by 
   preemption, one can do that by signaling prioritized sessions: 
    
   o  using "Resource-Priority" header in SIP 
    
   o  using Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP 
    
   o  using Preemption Policy Element in RSVP with: 
    
      *  setup (Prioritized-1) > defending (Prioritized-2) 
    
      *  setup (Prioritized-2) <= defending (Prioritized-1) 
    
      *  setup (Prioritized-1) <= defending (Non-Prioritized) 
    
      *  setup (Prioritized-2) <= defending (Non-Prioritized) 
    
   If one wants to implement a prioritized service based on Session   
   Queueing, on "prioritized access to network layer resources", and 
   ensure that prioritized sessions can preempt regular sessions, one 
   could do that by signaling Prioritized sessions: 
    
   o  using "Resource-Priority" header in SIP 
    
   o  using Admission-Priority Policy Element in RSVP 
    
   o  using Preemption Policy Element in RSVP with: 
    
      *  setup (Prioritized) > defending (Non-Prioritized) 
    
      *  setup (Non-Prioritized) <= defending (Prioritized) 
    
   If one wants to implement a prioritized service based on Session   
   Queuing, on "prioritized access to network layer resources", and   
   ensure that prioritized sessions can partially preempt regular   
   sessions (i.e. reduce their reservation size), one could do that by   
   signaling prioritized sessions: 
    
   o  using "Resource-Priority" header in SIP

Appendix C.  Preemption Policy 
    
   This paragraph explains a newly proposed policy admission control 
   method based on preemption-policy admission control method of elastic 
   preemption, which aims to weaken the influence on network caused by 
   an entire preemption method that discontinues the connection of low 
   priority services, reaching the purpose of improving admission rate 
   of high priority services by lowering the qualities of low priority 
   services. When the network is overloaded and the resource is 
   insufficient, use preemption method to allocate resources to high 
   priority services. When several sessions compete for accessing into 
   network resources in the nodes, via the "preemption priority" in 
   signaling, nodes first allocate resources to sessions of high 
   priority and the admission requests by some low priority or non-
   priority services may be rejected; Or nodes dismantle several 
   previously admitted session connections and reallocate resources to 
   new sessions of high priority services. 
    
   When a session needs to access into the network by preemption, 
   compare its "preemption priority" with the "defending priority" which 
   has already accessed into network session, all sessions with a higher 
   "preemption priority" than the "defending priority" can preempt; Once 
   network admit this session, "preemption priority" is out of action 
   and "defending priority" is used to compare with the new "preemption 
   priority". The "preemption priority" of one session stream is smaller 
   or equal to the "defending priority". The bigger the difference value 
   of these two kinds of priorities is, the higher degree of stability   
   this session stream has, avoiding being preempted repeatedly. 
    
   Admission control based on preemption priority requests allocated 
   resources for new high priority services by dismantling low priority 
   services. When the resource reservation requests of high priority 
   services increase, it will lead to excessive interruptions of low 
   priority services, where the most direct influence is that it can 
   cause router shaking. This is because that the service quantity of 
   preempted resource needs to reroute, or the packet loss ratio of the 
   whole network will increase. Excessive resource preemption inevitably 
   results to instability of system, thus impact the usability of 
   network. 
    
   QoS requirements in network service are the basic foundation of 
   admission control. However, these requirements are not fixed values, 
   but in some elastic range. E.g. VoIP of rtPS and ertPS scheduling 
   meets the condition that bmin<bmax, which means it can meet the QoS

   requirements if bandwidth is in the range between bmin and bmax. 
   Elastic QoS's demands for network resource also have a definite 
   elasticity; therefore it should adjust the reservation bandwidth of 
   admitted services according to the statement of network resource so 
   as to meet the QoS of new high priority services that access to 
   network. 
    
   The signaling policy elements in admission control method of elastic 
   preemption policy are shown as Fig. 21.

           Fig.21     Elastic Preemption Priority Policy Elements 
    
   RB(requisition bandwidth) : The requisition bandwidth of each 
   resource reservation requisition when asking to access into network. 
   This value can be increased to the maximum bandwidth, or be reduced 
   to the minimum. 
    
   MaxB(maximum bandwidth): The maximum requisition bandwidth that SLA 
   allows. 
    
   MinB(minimum bandwidth): The minimum requisition bandwidth that SLA 
   allows. 
    
   When the high priority sessions are asking to access into network but 
   the resource is insufficient, policy nodes choose non-priority and 
   low "priority sessions" reservation bandwidth on links to reduce to 
   the minimum requisition bandwidth that SLA allows using elastic 
   preemption priority policy element, thus guarantee the basic quality 
   of communication. While high priority services reduce, allocate 
   bandwidth according to RB. If the network load is relatively light, 
   it can allocate bandwidth for resource reservation requisition 
   sessions according to MaxB. 
    
   When resource reservation requisition arrives at the boundary of 
   network, firstly verify the validity of users and test that whether 
   this requisition is in the range which admission policy of the 
   autonomous system allows. Admission control column of PDP calculates 
   the condition of network resource using and determines whether there 
   is enough bandwidth to meet the requisition bandwidth of this  
   service. If it does, first choose the admission control method based

   on priority policy. If not, it needs increase the admission rate of 
   high priority services via preemption, using elastic policy 
   preemption method. This method starts to preempt from the service 
   connection which has the minimum defending priority, in turn reduces 
   the service reservation bandwidth to the MinB and maps this 
   information to the relevant policy element and sends it to PEP. 
   Calculate the residual bandwidth of network each time when the 
   preemption is successful until the usable bandwidth can meet the 
   bandwidth admission requisition of newly arrived services. 
   In order to further improve the admission rate of high priority 
   services, we can combine the entire preemption policy algorithm with 
   the elastic preemption policy algorithm, which means that using 
   elastic preemption policy algorithm still can not guarantee high 
   priority services of accessing into network, so it needs to dismantle 
   several low priority service connections on this basis.
