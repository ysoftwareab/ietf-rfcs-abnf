            DHCPv6 Extension for On Demand Mobility exposure
               draft-moses-dmm-dhcp-ondemand-mobility-00

Abstract

   Applications differ with respect to whether they need IP session
   continuity and/or IP address reachability.  Networks providing the
   same type of service to any mobile host and any application running
   on the host yields inefficiencies.  This document describes
   extensions to the DHCPv6 protocol to enable mobile hosts to indicate
   the required mobility type of the requested IP address, and networks
   to indicate the type of mobility service associated with the
   allocated IP address in return.

1.  Introduction

   [TBD reference to the On-demand draft] defines different types of
   mobility-associated services provided by access networks to mobile
   hosts with regards to maintaining IPv6 address continuity after an
   event of the host moving to different locations with different points
   of attachments within the IP network topology.  It further specifies
   means for applications to convey to the IP stack in the mobile host,
   their requirements regarding these services.

   This document specifies extensions to the DHCPv6 protocol specified
   in [RFC3315] in the form of a new DHCP option that specifies the type
   of mobility services associated with an IPv6 address.  The IP stack
   in a mobile host uses the DHCP client to specify the type of mobility
   service to be associated with an expected source IPv6 address.  The
   network uses the DHCP server to convey the type of service it is
   committed to provide with the assigned IPv6 address using this
   option.

   The type of service is associated by the network with the source IPv6
   address assigned to the mobile host.  For example, if a mobile host
   requests IP address continuity trough out the life of the IP session
   and the network commits to provide that service, it will associate
   the service with an assigned source IPv6 address, and reply with the
   IPv6 address and an indication of the type of service associated with
   that address.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  IPv6 Continuity Service Option

   The IPv6 Continuity Service option is used to specify the type of
   continuity service associated with a source IPv6 address.  The IPv6
   Continuity Service option must be encapsulated in the IAaddr-options
   field of the IA Address option.

   The format of the IPv6 Continuity Service options is:

   TBD - Add format description...

   In a message sent from a client to a server, the value of the IPv6
   Continuity Service option indicates the type of IP continuity
   required for the IPv6 address requested by the client.

   In a message sent from a server to a client, the value of the IPv6
   Continuity Service option indicates the type of IP continuity service
   committed by the network for the associated IPv6 address.

   If a server received a request to assign an IPv6 address with a
   specified IPv6 Continuity service, but cannot fulfill the request, it
   must reply with the [TBD] status.

   A server that does not support this option will discard it as well as
   the IA Address option that had this option encapsulated in one of its
   IAaddr-options field.

   If a client does not receive the requested address, it must resent
   the request without the desired IPv6 Continuity Service option since
   it is not supported by the server.  In that case, the host of the
   client cannot assume any IP continuity service behavior for that
   address.

   A server must not include the IPv6 Continuity Service option in the
   IAaddr-options field of an IA Address option, if not specifically
   requested previously by the client to which it is sending a message.

   If a client receives an IA Address option from a server with the IPv6
   Continuity Service option in the IAaddr-options field, without
   initially requesting a specific service using this option, it must
   discard the received IPv6 address.

   If the mobile host has no preference regarding the type of continuity
   service it uses the 'AnyType' value as the specified type of
   continuity service.  The Server will allocate an IP address with some
   continuity service and must specify the type in IPv6 Continuity
   Service option encapsulated in the IAaddr-options field of the IA
   Address option.  The method for selecting the type of continuity
   service is outside the scope of this specification.

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no specific security considerations for this option.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
