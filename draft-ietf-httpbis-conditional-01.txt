   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-
   level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypertext information
   systems.  This document formerly defined HTTP conditional requests,
   which has since been moved to the core HTTP Semantics document.

1.  Introduction

   Conditional requests are HTTP requests [Semantics] that include one
   or more header fields indicating a precondition to be tested before
   applying the method semantics to the target resource.
