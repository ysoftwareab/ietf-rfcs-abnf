Abstract 
    
   This document proposes a template for authors of EAP methods that 
   rely on shared keys, to document their work. 
   Since EAP methods have proliferated but only 4 are currently 
   standardized and since no simple shared key EAP method seems to be 
   widely available to replace EAP-MD5 that has been deprecated for 
   security reasons, this template is the first step towards 
   standardizing such an EAP method. 
   This document is indeed intended to help gather information on the 
   existing related work before requesting that a new work item be 
   opened at IETF to standardize a replacement for EAP-MD5.

INTERNET-DRAFT     EAP Shared Key Meth. Doc. Templ.         March 2004 
 
 
1. Introduction 
    
   At IETF 59, the EAP WG chairs gave a presentation on the status of 
   the different EAP methods, see [EAPMETHSTAT]. 
    
   This document agrees with the conclusion of this presentation: there 
   are too many undocumented or non-standardized EAP methods. It 
   especially acknowledges the lack of the most basic shared key EAP 
   method that could replace EAP-MD5 that has been deprecated for 
   security reasons, see [EAPbis]. 
    
   This document is an attempt to remedy this situation. 
    
   It is indeed intended to help gather information on existing work 
   that has been done on EAP shared key methods. 
    
   The compilation of this information will both serve as a motivation 
   to request that a new work item be opened at IETF to draft a standard 
   shared key method and as a way to set up a design team comprised of 
   people willing to help draft such a method (possibly including 
   authors of former shared key EAP methods). 
    
   This document is a template that needs to be filled in. Readers who 
   feel that they have proposed a shared key EAP method are kindly 
   requested to do so and send their input by e-mail to the author of 
   this document at the address indicated in section 7. 
    
1.1 Terminology 
    
   Shared key            : A shared key is a cryptographic key in the  
                           symmetric setting (see [HAC]). It is merely a  
                           sequence of binary digits of given length  
                           that should have been chosen at random. A  
                           shared key is sometimes referred to as a pre- 
                           shared key to emphasize that is derived by  
                           some out-of-band mechanism and that both  
                           parties already share the key before starting  
                           to communicate. 
                            
   Special infrastructure: By special infrastructure, this document  
                           means any additional infrastructure to the  
                           basic EAP infrastructure comprised of a  
                           standalone EAP peer and a standalone EAP  
                           server. For example, the GSM Authentication  
                           center which is typically (but not  
                           necessarily) required by [EAP-SIM] is  
                           considered to be special infrastructure, as  
                           well as the token cards possibly used by, for  
                           instance, [SecurID-EAP].

   for EAP-PSK, progress towards a stable version and merge to/replace 
   with a standard shared key EAP method 
    
2.5 IPR related to the method 
    
   Please state below any patent pending or already granted that you are 
   aware of relating to your method (precision would be nice but you can

   infrastructure is typically required or for EAP-GTC (see [EAPbis]), a 
   token card is typically required. 
    
2.7 Implementation availability 
    
2.7.1 Has the method been implemented? 
    
   Please state below if you have implemented or knows somebody who has 
   implemented your method, e.g. for EAP-PSK, it has not (yet) been 
   implemented. 
    
    
   If your method has not been implemented or if future work is 
   scheduled for some reason, please state below your plans or plans you 
   are aware of regarding its implementation in the future, e.g. for

INTERNET-DRAFT     EAP Shared Key Meth. Doc. Templ.         March 2004 
 
 
   contact address at the author of the method section) and the 
   implementation should be released by IETF 60. 
    
2.7.2 The different implementations available 
    
   Please state below the different implementations of your method you 
   are aware of, the platforms corresponding to these implementations 
   and the software license status of these implementations, e.g. for 
   EAP-PSK, no implementation is currently available. 
    
   If there is work scheduled regarding the implementation of your 
   method that you are aware of, please state below, the different 
   implementations of your method that are planned, the platforms 
   corresponding to these implementations and the software license 
   status of these implementations, e.g. for EAP-PSK, a peer 
   implementation under Windows XP using Microsoft SDK is planned as 
   well as a server implementation for Freeradius. Both implementations 
   will be released as open source (probably under a GNU GPL license). 
    
2.7.3 Has the method's implementation been field tested? 
    
   Please state below if you have been aware of any field 
   test/deployment of your method and please describe briefly these 
   tests/deployments (size, duration, results, etc.), e.g. for EAP-PSK, 
   there hasn't been any field test/deployment. 
    
   Please state below if you are aware of any future field 
   test/deployment of your method and please describe briefly these 
   tests/deployments (size, duration, points to be tested, etc.), e.g. 
   for EAP-PSK, there is a field deployment planned Q3 2004 for 
   approximately 500 hundred users during a trimester and since this 
   will be the first deployment, the tests will focus on user 
   experience, bandwidth and processing power consumption, unknown bugs, 
   etc., 
    
2.8 Security of the method 
    
2.8.1 The different cryptographic primitives used by the method 
    
   Please state below the different cryptographic primitives used by 
   your method (block cipher, stream cipher, hash function), e.g. for 
   EAP-PSK, AES-128 is the sole cryptographic primitive that is used. 
    
2.8.2 Compliance to [EAPbis] and [IEEE 802REQ] security requirements 
    
   Please state below the compliance status of your method regarding the 
   security requirements expressed in [EAPbis] and [IEEE 802REQ] 
   (complies, intends to comply, does not comply), e.g. for EAP-PSK, it 
   complies to both documents and intends to comply as they evolve.

2.8.3 Formal proofs backing up the security of the method 
    
   Please state below if the security techniques used in your method are 
   backed up by formal security proofs and if so, please provide 
   pointers to these proofs, e.g. for EAP-PSK the authentication is 
   backed by a security proof ([EAKD]) as well as the key derivation 
   ([SOBMO]) and the protected channel part ([EAX])- however it should 
   be clear that expert review is needed to assess if indeed the 
   security proofs aforementioned apply to EAP-PSK, if the interfaces 
   between the different parts do not introduce any new vulnerability 
   and if no major security property is outside the coverage of the 
   security proofs. 
    
2.9 General properties of the method 
    
2.9.1 Is the method up to date with the recent EAP WG documents? 
    
   Please state below if your method is up to date (features, 
   terminology, ...) with the recent EAP WG documents ([EAPbis] and 
   [EKMF]), e.g. EAP-PSK was up to date with these documents in the 
   beginning of February 2004. 
    
2.9.2 Specific design goals for the method 
    
   Please state below the different design goals that were considered 
   while drafting your method, e.g. for EAP-PSK, design goals were: 
     o Simplicity: It should be easy to implement and to deploy without 
        any pre-existing infrastructure. 
     o Wide applicability: It should be possible to use this method to 
        authenticate over any network. In particular, it should be 
        suitable for [IEEE 802.11] wireless LANs and comply to [IEEE 
        802REQ] 
     o Security: It should be conservative in its cryptographic design 
        and enjoy security proofs 
     o Extensibility: It should be possible to add to this method the 
        required extensions as their need appears 
     o Patent-avoidance: It should be free of any Intellectual Property 
        Right claims 
    
2.9.3 Specific features of the method 
    
   Please state below the specific features of your method you would 
   like to highlight, e.g. for EAP-PSK, it provides a protected channel 
   after a successful authentication for the server and the peer to 
   communicate over. 
    
2.10 IANA status of the method

   Please state below if your method has been allocated a PPP EAP type 
   by IANA and if so, please state that number. 
    
3. IANA considerations 
    
   This document does not introduce any new IANA consideration. 
    
4. Security considerations 
    
   This document does not introduce any new security issue for the 
   Internet.
