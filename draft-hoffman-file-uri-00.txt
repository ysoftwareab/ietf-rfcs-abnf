Abstract

   This document specifies the file: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   scheme that was originally specified in RFC 1738.  The purpose of
   this document is to allow RFC 1738 to be moved to historic while
   keeping the information about the scheme on standards track.

1.  Introduction

   URIs are were previously defined in RFC 2396 [RFC2396], which was
   updated by draft-fielding-uri-rfc2396bis [2396bis].  Those documents
   also specify how to define schemes for URIs.

Internet-Draft              The file: Scheme                 August 2004


   The first definition for many URI schemes appeared in RFC 1738
   [RFC1738].  Because that document has been moved to Historic status,
   this document copies the file: scheme from it to allow that material
   to remain on standards track.

2.  Scheme Definition

   The file URL scheme is used to designate files accessible on a
   particular host computer.  This scheme, unlike most other URL
   schemes, does not designate a resource that is universally accessible
   over the Internet.

   The file URL scheme has historically had little or no
   interoperability between platforms.  Further, implementers on a
   single platform have often disagreed on the syntaxt to use for a
   particular filesystem.  This docoument does not try to resolve those
   problems, only to show what has been commonly seen in use on the
   Internet.

   A file URL takes the form:

   file://<host>/<path>

   where <host> is the fully qualified domain name of the system on
   which the <path> is accessible, and <path> is a hierarchical
   directory path of the form <directory>/<directory>/.../<name>.

   As a special case, <host> can be the string "localhost" or the empty
   string; this is interpreted as "the machine from which the URL is
   being interpreted".  However, this part of the syntax has been
   ignored on many systems.  That is, for some systems, the following
   are considered equal, while on others they are not:

      file://localhost/path/to/file.txt
      file:///path/to/file.txt

   Some systems allow URLs to point to directories.  In this case, there
   is usually (but not always) a terminating "/" character, such as in:

   file://usr/local/bin/

   On systems running some versions of Microsoft Windows, the local
   drive specification is sometimes preceded by a "/" character.  Thus,
   for a file called "example.ini" in the "windows" directory on the
   "c:" drive, the URL might be:

   file:///c:/windows/example.ini

   For Windows shares, there is an additional "/" prepended to the name.
   Thus, the file "example.doc" on the shared directory "department"
   would have the URL:

   file:////department/example.doc

   The file URL scheme is unusual in that it does not specify an
   Internet protocol or access method for such files; as such, its
   utility in network protocols between hosts is limited.

3.  Security Considerations

   There are many security considerations for URI schemes discussed in
   draft-fielding-uri-rfc2396bis [2396bis].
