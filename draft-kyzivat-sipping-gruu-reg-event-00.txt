Abstract

   This draft defines an extension to RFC 3680 [1] for  representing the
   GRUU associated with a Contact.

1.  Introduction

   The proposal to add GRUU support to the REGISTER message [2]
   introduces another element of state to the registrar.  Subscribers to
   the registration event package [1] will sometimes have need for the

   new state.

   For example, the Welcome Notices example in [1] will only operate
   correctly if the contact address in the reg event notification is
   reachable by the sender of the welcome notice.  When the registering
   device is using the gruu extension, it is likely that the registered
   contact address will not be globally addressable, and the gruu should
   be used as the target address for the MESSAGE.

   The reg event package has provision for including extension elements
   within the &lt;contact&gt; element.  This draft proposes a new element that
   may be used in that context to deliver the GRUU corresponding to the
   contact.

2.  Description

   A new element (&lt;gruu&gt;) is defined which simply contains the GRUU.

   A notifier for the "reg" event package SHOULD include this element
   when a contact has an Instance ID and a GRUU is associated with the
   combination of the AOR and the Instance ID.  When used, the &lt;gruu&gt;
   element MUST be used within the &lt;contact&gt; element.

3.  Example

   The following is an example registration information document:

      &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
          &lt;reginfo xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:reginfo"
              xmlns:gr="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruu"
              xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
              version="0" state="full"&gt;
            &lt;registration aor="sip:user@example.com" id="as9"
                 state="active"&gt;
              &lt;contact id="76" state="active" event="registered"
                 duration-registered="7322"
                 q="0.8"&gt;
                   &lt;uri&gt;sip:user@192.0.2.1&lt;/uri&gt;
                   &lt;unknown-param name="+sip.instance"&gt;
                      "&lt;urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6&gt;"
                   &lt;/unknown-param&gt;
                   &lt;gr:gruu&gt;sip:hha9s8d=-999a@example.com&lt;/gruu&gt;
              &lt;/contact&gt;
            &lt;/registration&gt;
          &lt;/reginfo&gt;

4.  XML Schema Definition

   An gruu document is an XML document that MUST be well-formed and
   SHOULD be valid.  Gruu documents MUST be based on XML 1.0 and MUST be
   encoded using UTF-8.  This specification makes use of XML namespaces
   for identifying gruu documents.  The namespace URI for elements
   defined for this purpose is a URN, using the namespace identifier
   'ietf'.  This URN is:
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruu


   &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
   &lt;xs:schema targetNamespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruu"
     elementFormDefault="qualified"
     attributeFormDefault="unqualified"
     xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
     xmlns:tns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:gruu"&gt;
     &lt;xs:element name="gruu" type="xs:anyURI"/&gt;
   &lt;/xs:schema&gt;


5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the registration event package is
   discussed in RFC 3680 [1], and those considerations apply here.

   The addition of gruu information does not impact security negatively
   because the gruu is less sensitive than the contact URI itself.
