1. Introduction

   The increase in number, diversity and complexity of modern network
   devices and services bring new challenges for the management of
   network resources, such as IP addresses, bandwidth, VAS(Value Added
   Service) pool, etc. However, current approaches for address
   management result in low address allocation efficiency and complexity
   for the re-allocation of resources. A lack of integration between the
   IP address management functions of different OSS systems can make it
   difficult to share network resources. To reduce this complexity, and
   the associated OPEX and CAPEX, operators are looking for an
   intelligent, agile and flexible integration mechanism for the control
   and sharing of IP address resources, with a service-crossing and
   self-decision-making manner.

   Among all the resources aforementioned, address management gained
   traction by operators as it is fundamental for the provision of
   connectivity and services. This draft describes the problem and
   requirement of address management with solid and practical use cases
   provided by operators.

   IPAM (IP address management), is a means of planning, tracking, and
   managing the Internet Protocol address space used in a network. This
   topic is increasingly important as aforementioned that networks are
   deployed with increasing in number, diversity and complexity of
   modern network devices and services, resulting in more and larger
   address pools, different subnetting techniques, and more complex 128-
   bit hexadecimal numbers for IPv6, which are not as easily human-
   readable as IPv4 addresses. IPv6 networking, mobile computing, and
   multihoming require more dynamic address management. [WIKI]

   In some scenarios, the address management system is integrated with
   the operator's network. For example, the address system integrated in
   CMTS, which is used to allocate specific IP addresses and options to
   CM. The second example is the address system integrated in Network
   Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI), which is used to
   assign specified IP address to the VM. The third example is the
   address system in SDN network, the SDN controller could get the IP
   address of two inter-communication hosts, and then design an
   optimized forwarding path.

   In the examples above, the address allocation policy, e.g., specific
   IP address assigned to a specific VM, usually originates from a
   management system, e.g, OSS, Openstack, SDN controller. This is
   generally configured statically, via CLI or a configuration file.

   This approach poses the following problems for operators:
     o Low allocation efficiency
     o Manual configuration of address policy
     o Complexity in making real-time changes
     o Lack of an open, programmable interface between each system 
       requiring IP addresses and the Management System


   Address pool management is a sub-issue of address management.
   Currently, operators are facing the following issues:

   1)   The need to control and share addresses among devices
      a) With address shortage problem, the remaining IPv4 address pools
         are usually quite scattered.
      b) It is complicated to manually configure all the address pools
         statically in BNGs.
      c) Sometimes, the address pools are needed to be transited from
         one BNG to another.
   2)   The need to control and share addresses among functions
      a) For IPv6 transition technologies, e.g. DS-Lite, lw4over6, etc.,
         they need to be configured with address pools as translated
         addresses.
      b) Different address pools are needed to be configured on each
         transition instance for HA support.
      c) The occupation of the address pools may vary during different
         transition periods.

   I2APM: Interface to address pool management

4. Problems and Use Cases

   The Broadband Network Gateway (BNG), which manages a routable IP
   address on behalf of each subscriber, should be configured with the
   IP address pools allocated to subscribers.  However, currently
   operators are facing with the address shortage problem, the remaining
   IPv4 address pools are usually quite scattered, no more than /24 per
   address pool in many cases.  Therefore, it is complicated to manually
   configure the address pools on lots of Broadband Network Gateway (BNG)
   for operators.  For large scale MAN, the number of BNGs can be up to


Xie, et al           Expires September 21, 2014               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft  PS for Centralized Address Management       March 2016


   over one hundred.  Manual configuration on all the BNGs statically
   will not only greatly increase the workload, but also decrease the
   utilization efficiency of the address pools when the number of
   subscribers changes in the future. With NFV technology maturing, it
   can envisaged the edge of the IP network will be likely software-
   based, vBNG will be introduced into the network for broadband service
   provisioning. Since vBNG is launched and withdrawal dynamically based
   on the actual volume of users and traffic, the address pool
   configuration in vBNG will be even more dynamic than that of the
   classical hardware-based BNG

               Figure 1  Configure address pools on the BNGs



   Figure 1 illustrates address pool configuration for BNGs. Each BNG
   requires configuration with several IPv4 and IPv6 address pools used

   for allocation to subscribers. Those address pools are configured
   through an API from a centralized Address Management Server. Typical
   examples include IPv4 and IPv6 address pool configuration.



   The second use case for address pool configuration is for IPv6
   migration.  IPv6 transition mechanisms (e.g. DS-Lite, lw4over6, etc.),
   need to be configured with address pools to be used as translated
   routeable addresses.  When high availability features, e.g. active-
   active/active-standby failover mechanism, are used, different address
   pools may need to be configured on each transition instance.  This
   will further increase the number of address pools that need to be
   configured.

   Figure 2 illustrates address configuration on the IPv6 transition
   devices. For example, each DS-Lite AFTR or CGN devices should be
   configured with IPv4 address pool. Those address pools are configured
   through an API from centralized Address Management Server.



   The third use case for address pool configuration is IPAM. Nowadays
   in provider environments, address management is implemented at
   various levels, from centralized excel spreadsheets to application
   specific databases/software (IPAM). Most IPAM software implement a
   RESTful API so that DevOps can use the IPAM for their needs, while
   having a centralized database.

                 Figure 3 Address configuration API of IPAM



   Figure 3 illustrates a general address configuration model in an IPAM
   tool. A management system, as Openstack, OSS, NMS, could configure
   address and address allocation policy through API.  Typical policy
   examples is specific static IP address allocate to specific host.

Internet-Draft  PS for Centralized Address Management       March 2016


   In CMTS scene, operations support system(OSS) or control system
   design the address allocation policy, deploy it to the CMTS device
   through an open, programmable interface. Then the CM could get
   customized IP address and DHCP options from address management system
   in CMTS.

   In Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure(NFVI) scene, the
   Management System(e.g., Openstack) design the address allocation
   policy, deploy it to the IPAM tool through an open, programmable
   interface. Then the VM could get customized IP address from IPAM tool.

   In SDN network scene, two host communicate pass through a SDN network.
   The Management System(SDN controller) get the IP address of the two
   inter-communication hosts from address management system through an
   open, programmable interface, then the SDN controller could design an
   optimized forwarding path, and deploy it into forwarding plane.



5. Requirements

   Based on the analysis above, some requirements for IP address
   management can be highlighted as following:

   1) Centralized server placement, with a centralized address
   management server, IP addresses can be managed ,allocated and
   reclaimed in a more optimized and efficient way.
   2) Dynamic, since address consumption in each device is time-changing
   and dynamic based on actual volume of the service, traffic or
   sessions, the IP address management process should be dynamic
   accordingly.
   3) Multiple types of devices support, in production network, there
   are multiple types of IP equipment, i.e., BNG,vBNG, CGN, FW,etc,
   which need the IP address allocated from IP address management server,
   all these equipment should be supported.
   4) Multiple types of IP address support, Not only IPv4 address, but
   also IPv6 address should be supported as well. Since some equipment,
   such as BRAS, allocates private IP address to end users from address
   pool, Private address should be supported as well as public address.

   In addition to the requirements above, as a telco network element, IP
   address management server, should meet other requirements,such as
   high availability, highly-secured,high-preformance, as well, since
   they are the basic requirements to telco equipment, they are not
   discussed in detail here.
