Draft                           IGMP MIB                       June 1999

1.  Abstract

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
particular, it describes objects used for managing the Internet Group
Management Protocol (IGMP).

2.  Introduction

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
particular, it describes objects used for managing the Internet Group
Management Protocol (IGMP), version 1 [16] or version 2 [17]. All of
this MIB module is applicable to IP multicast routers; a subset is
applicable to hosts implementing IGMP.

3.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
     purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC
     1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version, called
     SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

o    Message protocols for transferring management information. The
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
     described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
     protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
     called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
     The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
     described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. The first
     set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described
     in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations and associated
     PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

Draft                           IGMP MIB                       June 1999

o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
     the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [15].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A MIB
conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.

3.1.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defined in the
SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
an administratively assigned name.  The object type together with an
object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of
the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
termed the descriptor, to refer to the object type.

4.  Overview

This MIB module contains two tables:

(1)  the IGMP Interface Table which contains one row for each interface
     on which IGMP is enabled, and

(2)  the IGMP Cache Table which contains one row for each IP multicast
     group for which there are members on a particular interface.

Both tables are intended to be implemented by hosts and routers, but
some columnar objects in each table apply only to routers.

6.  Security Considerations

This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information
related to multicast sessions.  Some of these objects could contain
sensitive information.  In particular, the igmpCacheSelf and
igmpCacheLastReporter can be used to identify machines which are
listening to a given group address.  There are also a number of objects
that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create, which
allow an administrator to configure IGMP in the router.

While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively
innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause a
denial of service.  Hence, the support for SET operations in a non-
secure environment without proper protection can have a negative effect
on network operations.

SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and SET
(change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the
User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based Access
Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give access to
those objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
rights to access them.
