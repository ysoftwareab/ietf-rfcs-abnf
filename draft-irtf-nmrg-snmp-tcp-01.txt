1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a transport mapping for using the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP) over TCP. The transport mapping defined in
   this memo can be used with any version of SNMP. This document extends
   the transport mappings defined in RFC 1906 [1].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

3.  SNMP over TCP

   SNMP over TCP is an optional transport mapping. Implementors are
   encouraged to support SNMP over TCP whenever possible because this
   enables applications to make more efficient bulk transfers of MIB
   data [3].

   The originator of a request/response transaction chooses the
   transport protocol for the entire transaction. The transport protocol
   MUST NOT change during a transaction.

   In general, originators of request/response transactions are free to
   use the transport they assume is the best in a given situation.
   However, as TCP has a larger footprint on resource usage than UDP,
   applications using SNMP over TCP may choose to switch back to UDP by
   refusing new TCP connections whenever necessary (e.g. too many open
   TCP connections).

3.1.  Serialization

   Each instance of a message is serialized into a single BER-encoded
   message, using the algorithm specified in Section 8 of RFC 1906 [1].
   The BER-encoded message is then sent over a TCP connection.

   It is possible to exchange multiple SNMP request/response pairs over
   a single (persistent) TCP connection. The length field in the BER-
   encoded SNMP message is used to separate multiple requests sent over
   a single TCP connection.

3.2.  Well-Known Values

   It is RECOMMENDED that administrators configure their SNMP entities
   containing command generators to listen on TCP port 161 for incoming
   connections. It is also RECOMMENDED that SNMP entities containing
   notification receivers be configured to listen on TCP port 162 for

Internet-Draft      SNMP-over-TCP Transport Mapping            June 1999

   connection requests.

   When an SNMP entity uses the TCP transport mapping, it MUST be
   capable of accepting messages that are at least 8192 octets in size.
   Implementation of larger values is encouraged whenever possible.

3.3.  Connection Management

   The use of TCP connections introduces costs. Connection establishment
   and teardown cause additional network traffic. Furthermore,
   maintaining open connections binds resources in the network layer of
   the underlying operating system.

   TCP connections are intended to be used when the size of the
   transferred data is large. If a connectionless transport were used
   instead, its small packet-size constraint would cause latency to
   increase excessively.

   Another advantage of using TCP connections, regardless of the message
   size, is that you do not need to implement retransmissions at the
   application level. This may result in simpler management
   applications.

   All SNMP entities (whether in an agent role or manager role) can
   close TCP connections at any point in time. This ensures that SNMP
   entities can control their resource usage and shut down TCP
   connections that are not used. SNMP engines SHOULD NOT process any
   outstanding requests if the underlying TCP connection has been
   closed. A `noResponse' error condition SHOULD be signalled for
   outstanding requests for command generator applications if the TCP
   connection is closed before a response has been received.
