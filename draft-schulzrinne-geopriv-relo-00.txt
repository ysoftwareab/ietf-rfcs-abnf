Abstract

   In some network configurations, it is desirable for the end system to
   be able to obtain its geodetic or civic location using an
   application-layer protocol.  This document describes RELO; a simple,
   HTTP-based stateless protocol that fulfills this need.

Internet-Draft                    RELO                         June 2006


1.  Introduction

   The RELO protocol allows end systems (devices) to obtain information
   about their current geodetic (longitude, latitude) or civic
   (jurisdictional or postal street address) location, based on their
   Internet Protocol address or possibly other identifiers.  The
   protocol uses HTTP [3] to retrieve the information.  The location
   information can be returned by value or by reference, either for
   retrieval or for event notification by subscription.

   The protocol is motivated by the requirement that end user network-
   layer equipment, such as DSL modems, routers, NATs and wireless
   access points, cannot be modified.  Hence, a DHCP or PPP based
   solution cannot be reused.  A more detailed problem statement is
   provided in [11].  To reduce privacy risks, RELO is designed for
   "first-party" retrieval, i.e., the device obtains its own location or
   a reference thereto.  It is not designed for a third party to
   retrieve location information about a device.  However, RELO may
   retrieve a reference to location information that can be passed to
   third parties.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT","RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

   This document reuses terminology introduced by RFC 3693 [6] and [11].

3.  Overview

   This section describes the Location Information Server (LIS)
   discovery procedure (see Section 3.1), the query message (see
   Section 3.2) and the response message (see Section 3.3).

3.1  Discovery

   The URI for the location server is conveyed via DNS (S-NAPTR) [8].
   The domain is determined from the domain name of the end host,
   typically conveyed as part of the configuration information or
   obtainable from the public IP address via DNS PTR records.


      dhcp-17.example.com.
      ;      order pref flags service      regexp
      IN NAPTR 50   50  "a"  "Location.relo"     ""
      ;  replacement
         relo.example.org

Internet-Draft                    RELO                         June 2006


3.2  Query

   The query is transmitted to the server in an HTTP GET request, using
   the media type application/relo+xml.  The use of TLS [10] is
   RECOMMENDED.

   The end system is identified by default by its IP address, contained
   in the IP packets carrying the HTTP request.  If the querier is
   behind a NAT or firewall, the server will see the querier's public IP
   address and use that address to identify the end system.  In those
   cases, the location of the network termination equipment, such as the
   DSL modem or 802.11 access point, will be returned, not the actual
   location of the querier since the LIS generally has no way to
   estimate that location.  Other identifiers, such as switch and port
   information, are for further study.

   The format of the location information is contained in the <by>
   element of the query and can indicate that either civic or
   geo(spatial) information is desired and whether the client wishes to
   obtain the value ("value"), a reference to the current value
   ("reference") or a subscription to change notifications for the value
   ("events").  A query example is shown below:


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <get-location by="value" type="civic"
     xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:relo1"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" />

   This protocol does not provide the ability for the end host to
   transmit a location estimate as, for example, obtained from a local
   GPS receiver, to the LIS.

3.3  Response

   A successful response contains the civic and or geospatial location
   information related to the identifier of the querier.  Note that this
   proposal does not return a PIDF-LO [12] since most of the values
   carried by the PIDF-LO cannot be meaningfully instantiated by the
   network without the help of the end host.  This proposal allows the
   end host to instantiate the values byself without introducing
   security challenges and privacy risks.  If the querier indicated a
   preference for location-by-reference, the answer simply contains a
   URI-list, i.e., media type text/uri-list [2].

   Normal HTTP status responses are used to indicate failure conditions,
   e.g., when the information is unavailable.

   The server indicates the validity period of the information using the
   HTTP Expires header field.  If a reference is returned, the reference
   URL itself is not guaranteed to be valid beyond the expiration time.

   The server MAY provide one or more URLs in a new HTTP header field,
   Subscribe, that the client can subscribe to if it wants to receive
   updates for the object retrieved via HTTP.  At least one of the URLs
   MUST be a SIP URL.  For SIP, the event name to be used in the
   subscription can be encoded in the URL.  (An HTTP header field was
   chosen since the subscription mechanism does not depend on the media
   type and also applies to media types that would make it difficult to
   embed such subscription URLs, such as a JPEG image.)  The server
   makes no guarantees that the client has the appropriate credentials
   to subscribe to the object.  Clients MAY support this mechanism; all
   clients that do support subscriptions MUST support the SIP SUBSCRIBE
   and NOTIFY methods.

   The field value consists of one or more absolute URIs:

     Subcribe = "Subscribe" ":" 1#absoluteURI

   An example is:

     Subscribe: sip:data@example.com?Event=location

   [TBD: Since this mechanism is not limited to location delivery, this
   might be better separated into a stand-alone draft.]

   The response containing the location information is not signed.

   Response message examples are shown below starting with a response
   providing geospatial location information and followed by civic
   location information.  Finally, we show an example with location-by-
   referency.

   This document registers the label "RELO" as the S-NAPTR application
   service tag according to [8] for location lookup services and defines
   the intended usage, interoperability considerations and security
   considerations (Section 6).

   This document requests the registration of a new message header
   field, 'Subscribe', according to RFC 3864 [7].

6.  Security Considerations

   If IP addresses are used as identifiers, RELO relies on return
   routability to ensure that only the current owner of an IP address
   can obtain location information for that host, and assumes that an
   attacker cannot generate and intercept packets for a spoofed IP
   address.  Note that TLS itself does not prevent client address
   spoofing if the attacker can intercept and generate IP packets with
   the victim's IP address.

   The victim can be protected against this privacy breach if the client
   and LIS share a secret, such as a username/password combination, and
   the LIS can associate an IP address with a particular user, e.g.,
   based on PPP authentication.  In that case, HTTP digest
   authentication can be used to prevent a third party from using a
   spoofed IP address to fraudulently obtain location information.
   Unfortunately, such authentication information is not generally
   available to wireless nodes in residential networks, for example.

   To prevent others from accessing location information for a
   particular host, the reference to a Location Object MUST NOT be
   guessable.  For example, it may contain a random component.  It is
   RECOMMENDED to use TLS with confidentiality protection to prevent
   eavesdroppers to observe the protocol exchange between the end host
   and the LIS.

   Signing of location information is beyond the scope of this document
   [TBD; if desired, reference to other document, since this is not
   specific to obtaining location information].  Thus, colluding
   attackers may be able to obtain and replay location information that
   does not correspond to their true location.
