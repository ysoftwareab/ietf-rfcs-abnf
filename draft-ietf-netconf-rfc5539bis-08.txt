  Using the NETCONF Protocol over Transport Layer Security (TLS) with
                      Mutual X.509 Authentication
                    draft-ietf-netconf-rfc5539bis-08

Abstract

   The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to
   install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices.
   This document describes how to use the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   protocol with mutual X.509 authentication to secure the exchange of
   NETCONF messages.  This revision of RFC 5539 documents the new
   message framing used by NETCONF 1.1 and it obsoletes RFC 5539.

1.  Introduction

   The NETCONF protocol [RFC6241] defines a mechanism through which a
   network device can be managed.  NETCONF is connection-oriented,
   requiring a persistent connection between peers.  This connection
   must provide integrity, confidentiality, peer authentication, and
   reliable, sequenced data delivery.

   This document defines how NETCONF messages can be exchanged over
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246].  Implementations MUST
   support mutual TLS certificate-based authentication [RFC5246].  This
   assures the NETCONF server of the identity of the principal who
   wishes to manipulate the management information.  It also assures the
   NETCONF client of the identity of the server for which it wishes to
   manipulate the management information.

Internet-Draft              NETCONF over TLS                January 2015


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Connection Initiation

   The peer acting as the NETCONF client MUST act as the TLS client.
   The TLS client actively opens the TLS connection and the TLS server
   passively listens for the incoming TLS connections.  The well-known
   TCP port number 6513 is used by NETCONF servers to listen for TCP
   connections established by NETCONF over TLS clients.  The TLS client
   MUST send the TLS ClientHello message to begin the TLS handshake.
   Once the TLS handshake has finished, the client and the server MAY
   begin to exchange NETCONF messages.  Client and server identity
   verification is done before the NETCONF <hello> message is sent.
   This means that the identity verification is completed before the
   NETCONF session is started.

3.  Message Framing

   All NETCONF messages MUST be sent as TLS "application data".  It is
   possible that multiple NETCONF messages be contained in one TLS
   record, or that a NETCONF message be transferred in multiple TLS
   records.

   The previous version [RFC5539] of this document used the framing
   sequence defined in [RFC4742], under the assumption that it could not
   be found in well-formed XML documents.  However, this assumption is
   not correct [RFC6242].  In order to solve this problem, this document
   adopts the framing protocol defined in [RFC6242] as follows:

   The NETCONF <hello> message MUST be followed by the character
   sequence ]]>]]>.  Upon reception of the <hello> message, the peers
   inspect the announced capabilities.  If the :base:1.1 capability is
   advertised by both peers, the chunked framing mechanism defined in
   Section 4.2 of [RFC6242] is used for the remainder of the NETCONF
   session.  Otherwise, the old end-of-message-based mechanism (see
   Section 4.3 of [RFC6242]) is used.

4.  Connection Closure

   A NETCONF server will process NETCONF messages from the NETCONF
   client in the order in which they are received.  A NETCONF session is
   closed using the <close-session> operation.  When the NETCONF server
   processes a <close-session> operation, the NETCONF server SHALL
   respond and close the TLS session as described in Section 7.2.1 of
   [RFC5246].

5.  Certificate Validation

   Both peers MUST use X.509 certificate path validation [RFC5280] to
   verify the integrity of the certificate presented by the peer.  The
   presented X.509 certificate may also be considered valid if it
   matches a locally configured certificate fingerprint.  If X.509
   certificate path validation fails and the presented X.509 certificate
   does not match a locally configured certificate fingerprint, the
   connection MUST be terminated as defined in [RFC5246].

6.  Server Identity

   The NETCONF client MUST check the identity of the server according to
   Section 6 of [RFC6125].

7.  Client Identity

   The NETCONF server MUST verify the identity of the NETCONF client to
   ensure that the incoming request to establish a NETCONF session is
   legitimate before the NETCONF session is started.

   The NETCONF protocol [RFC6241] requires that the transport protocol's
   authentication process results in an authenticated NETCONF client
   identity whose permissions are known to the server.  The
   authenticated identity of a client is commonly referred to as the
   NETCONF username.  The following algorithm is used by the NETCONF
   server to derive a NETCONF username from a certificate:

   o  The server maintains an ordered list of mappings of certificates
      to NETCONF usernames.  The username is derived by considering each
      list entry in order.  The fingerprint member of a list entry
      determines whether the list entry is a match:

      1.  If the list entry's fingerprint value matches that of the
          presented certificate, then consider the list entry as a
          successful match.

      2.  If the list entry's fingerprint value matches that of a
          locally held copy of a trusted CA certificate, and that CA
          certificate was part of the CA certificate chain to the
          presented certificate, then consider the list entry as a
          successful match.

   o  Once a matching list entry has been found, the mapping type
      property of the list entry is used to determine how the username
      associated with the certificate should be determined.  Possible
      mapping options are:

      A.  The username is explicitly configured.

      B.  The subjectAltName's rfc822Name is mapped to a username.

      C.  The subjectAltName's dNSName is mapped to a username.

      D.  The subjectAltName's iPAddress is mapped to a username.

      E.  Any of the subjectAltName's rfc822Name, dNSName, iPAddress is
          mapped to a username.

      F.  The certificate's CommonName is mapped to a username.

   o  If it is impossible to determine a username from the list entry's
      data combined with the data presented in the certificate, then
      additional list entries MUST be searched looking for another
      potential match.  Similarily, if the username does not comply to
      the NETCONF requirements on usernames [RFC6241] (i.e., the
      username is not representable in XML), then additional list
      entries MUST be searched looking for another potential match.  If
      there are no further list entries, the TLS session MUST be
      terminated.

   The username provided by the NETCONF over TLS implementation will be
   made available to the NETCONF message layer as the NETCONF username
   without modification.

8.  Cipher Suites

   Implementations MUST support TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] and are REQUIRED to
   support the mandatory-to-implement cipher suite.  Implementations MAY
   implement additional TLS cipher suites that provide mutual
   authentication [RFC5246] and confidentiality as required by NETCONF
   [RFC6241].  Implementations SHOULD follow the recommendations given
   in [I-D.ietf-uta-tls-bcp].

9.  Security Considerations

   NETCONF is used to access configuration and state information and to
   modify configuration information, so the ability to access this
   protocol should be limited to users and systems that are authorized
   to view the NETCONF server's configuration and state or to modify the
   NETCONF server's configuration.

   Configuration or state data may include sensitive information, such
   as usernames or security keys.  So, NETCONF requires communications
   channels that provide strong encryption for data privacy.  This
   document defines a NETCONF over TLS mapping that provides for support

Internet-Draft              NETCONF over TLS                January 2015


   of strong encryption and authentication.  The security considerations
   for TLS [RFC5246] and NETCONF [RFC6241] apply here as well.

   NETCONF over TLS requires mutual authentication.  Neither side should
   establish a NETCONF over TLS connection with an unknown, unexpected,
   or incorrect identity on the opposite side.  This document does not
   support third-party authentication (e.g., backend Authentication,
   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) servers) due to the fact that TLS
   does not specify this way of authentication and that NETCONF depends
   on the transport protocol for the authentication service.  If third-
   party authentication is needed, the SSH transport can be used.

   RFC 5539 assumes that the end-of-message (EOM) sequence, ]]>]]>,
   cannot appear in any well-formed XML document, which turned out to be
   mistaken.  The EOM sequence can cause operational problems and open
   space for attacks if sent deliberately in NETCONF messages.  It is
   however believed that the associated threat is not very high.  This
   document still uses the EOM sequence for the initial <hello> message
   to avoid incompatibility with existing implementations.  When both
   peers implement :base:1.1 capability, a proper framing protocol
   (chunked framing mechanism; see Section 3) is used for the rest of
   the NETCONF session, to avoid injection attacks.

10.  IANA Considerations

   Based on the previous version of this document, RFC 5539, IANA has
   assigned a TCP port number (6513) in the "Registered Port Numbers"
   range with the service name "netconf-tls".  This port will be the
   default port for NETCONF over TLS, as defined in Section 2.  Below is
   the registration template following the rules in [RFC6335].
