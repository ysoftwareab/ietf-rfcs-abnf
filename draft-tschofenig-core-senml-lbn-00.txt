1.  Introduction

   The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) specification, see RFC 8428
   [RFC8428], defines a format for representing simple sensor
   measurements and device parameters.

   Ideally, sensor readings used in the Internet of Things environment
   should be as small as possible.  For this reason the specification
   also defines an encoding of these sensor measurements and device
   parameters in CBOR (on top of other serialization formats).

   A design decision in SenML was, however, that each measurement
   transmitted over the network is self-contained and contains
   information that uniquely identifies and differentiates the sensor
   from all others - not only locally on the device but globally.

   This is accomplished by the combination of two fields, namely the
   'Name' and the 'Base Name' values.  The specification requires the
   concatenation of the Name and the Base Name values to yield the name
   of the sensor and recommends that the concatenated names be
   represented as URIs or URNs.

   Figure 1 is an example taken from RFC 8428.

    {"n":"label","vs":"Machine Room"},
    {"n":"open","vb":false},
    {"n":"nfc-reader","vd":"aGkgCg"}
 ]

   The global identification of every measurement as it is traveling
   through the network and through different systems has its use case
   and allows easy identification of the source and enables correlation.

   Unfortunately, it also has drawbacks:

   o  The unique identification of the sensor adds a substantial
      overhead, particularly when the sensor identification is verbose.
      Deployed systems, for example, make use of RFC 4122 [RFC4122] Type
      5 Universally Unique IDentifier (UUIDs).

   o  The global identification of every measurements is often
      unnecessary when the SenML is used as a mechanism to represent
      data for device-to-clould communication or cloud-to-gateway
      communication where data is subsequently processed, aggregated or
      otherwise modified.  In such systems, the identification of the
      sensor and the device has its origin in the security context
      rather than in the SenML contained measurment.  LwM2M [LWM2M] is
      an example of such an architecture.

   o  Finally, there are privacy implications of globally identifying
      each measurements and some deployments may prefer better privacy
      protection over ease of correlation.

   This specification therefore updates RFC 8428 and defines a new Local
   Base Name value (lbn) that can be used instead of the Base Name value
   defined in RFC 8428.

   Figure 2 shows an example based on LwM2M use of SenML.

    [
       {"lbn":"/3303/", "n":"0/5700/", "v":25.2},
       {"n":"/1/5700/", "v":5}
    ]

      Figure 2: SenML Example Measurement with Local Base Name value

   Note: In the LwM2M data model objects, object instances, and
   resources are encoded as numerical values.  The value of '3303'
   refers to the Temperature object, '0' and '1' to the two instances of
   the resource '5700' (Sensor Value).  Hence, this measurement
   indicates that the two temperator sensors expose their sensor
   readings.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Local Base Name SenML Structure and Semantics

   This specification defines one new lable, the Local Base Name value,
   which is used instead of the Base Name value.  For practical purposes
   the Local Base Name / Name concatination does not need to be a URN or
   a URI because existing data models used in the IoT space do not all
   make use of URIs/URNs.

    +-------------------+-------+------------+------------+------------+
    |          Name     | Label | CBOR Label | JSON Type  | XML Type   |
    +-------------------+-------+------------+------------+------------+
    | Local Base Name   | lbn   |          8 | String     | string     |
    +-------------------+-------+------------+------------+------------+

                   Figure 3: Local Base Name SenML Label

4.  CDDL

   This document defines a new value to be added to the CDDL defined in
   Section 11 of RFC 8428.

   The new key-value-pair is

    lbn => tstr        ; Local Base Name

5.  Security Considerations

   This document inherits the security properties of RFC 8428 but
   improves its privacy features by removing the unique identification
   of the sensor when the Local Base Name value is used instead of the
   Name / Base Name combination.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register the following new entry in the SenML Labels
   Registry.
