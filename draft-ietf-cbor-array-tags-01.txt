   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Tags for Typed Arrays
                     draft-ietf-cbor-array-tags-01

Abstract

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, RFC 7049) is a data
   format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small
   code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the
   need for version negotiation.

   The present document makes use of this extensibility to define a
   number of CBOR tags for typed arrays of numeric data, as well as two
   additional tags for multi-dimensional and homogeneous arrays.  It is
   intended as the reference document for the IANA registration of the
   CBOR tags defined.

1.  Introduction

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, [RFC7049]) provides
   for the interchange of structured data without a requirement for a
   pre-agreed schema.  RFC 7049 defines a basic set of data types, as
   well as a tagging mechanism that enables extending the set of data
   types supported via an IANA registry.

   Recently, a simple form of typed arrays of numeric data have received
   interest both in the Web graphics community [TypedArray] and in the
   JavaScript specification [TypedArrayES6], as well as in corresponding
   implementations [ArrayBuffer].

   Since these typed arrays may carry significant amounts of data, there
   is interest in interchanging them in CBOR without the need of lengthy
   conversion of each number in the array.

   This document defines a number of interrelated CBOR tags that cover
   these typed arrays, as well as two additional tags for multi-
   dimensional and homogeneous arrays.  It is intended as the reference
   document for the IANA registration of the tags defined.

Internet-Draft         CBOR tags for typed arrays          February 2019


1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The term "byte" is used in its now customary sense as a synonym for
   "octet".  Where bit arithmetic is explained, this document uses the
   notation familiar from the programming language C (including C++14's
   0bnnn binary literals), except that the operator "**" stands for
   exponentiation.

2.  Typed Arrays

   Typed arrays are homogeneous arrays of numbers, all of which are
   encoded in a single form of binary representation.  The concatenation
   of these representations is encoded as a single CBOR byte string
   (major type 2), enclosed by a single tag indicating the type and
   encoding of all the numbers represented in the byte string.

2.1.  Types of numbers

   Three classes of numbers are of interest: unsigned integers (uint),
   signed integers (two's complement, sint), and IEEE 754 binary
   floating point numbers (which are always signed).  For each of these
   classes, there are multiple representation lengths in active use:

                +-----------+--------+--------+-----------+
                | Length ll | uint   | sint   | float     |
                +-----------+--------+--------+-----------+
                | 0         | uint8  | sint8  | binary16  |
                | 1         | uint16 | sint16 | binary32  |
                | 2         | uint32 | sint32 | binary64  |
                | 3         | uint64 | sint64 | binary128 |
                +-----------+--------+--------+-----------+

                          Table 1: Length values

   Here, sintN stands for a signed integer of exactly N bits (for
   instance, sint16), and uintN stands for an unsigned integer of
   exactly N bits (for instance, uint32).  The name binaryN stands for
   the number form of the same name defined in IEEE 754.

   Since one objective of these tags is to be able to directly ship the
   ArrayBuffers underlying the Typed Arrays without re-encoding them,

   and these may be either in big endian (network byte order) or in
   little endian form, we need to define tags for both variants.

   In total, this leads to 24 variants.  In the tag, we need to express
   the choice between integer and floating point, the signedness (for
   integers), the endianness, and one of the four length values.

   In order to simplify implementation, a range of tags is being
   allocated that allows retrieving all this information from the bits
   of the tag: Tag values from TBD64 to TBD87.

   The value is split up into 5 bit fields: TBD0b010_f_s_e_ll, as
   detailed in Table 2.

   +----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Field    | Use                                                   |
   +----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | TBD0b010 | a constant such as '010', to be defined               |
   | f        | 0 for integer, 1 for float                            |
   | s        | 0 for unsigned integer or float, 1 for signed integer |
   | e        | 0 for big endian, 1 for little endian                 |
   | ll       | A number for the length (Table 1).                    |
   +----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

             Table 2: Bit fields in the low 8 bits of the tag

   The number of bytes in each array element can then be calculated by
   "2**(f + ll)" (or "1 << (f + ll)" in a typical programming language).
   (Notice that f and ll are the lsb of each nibble (4bit) in the byte.)

   In the CBOR representation, the total number of elements in the array
   is not expressed explicitly, but implied from the length of the byte
   string and the length of each representation.  It can be computed
   inversely to the previous formula: "bytelength >> (f + ll)".

   For the uint8/sint8 values, the endianness is redundant.  Only the
   big endian variant is used.  The little endian variant of sint8 MUST
   NOT be used, its tag is marked as reserved.  As a special case, the
   tag number that would have been the little endian variant of uint8 is
   used to signify that the numbers in the array are using clamped
   conversion from integers, as described in more detail in Section 7.1
   of [TypedArrayUpdate].

3.  Additional Array Tags

   This specification defines three additional array tags.  The Multi-
   dimensional Array tags can be combined with classical CBOR arrays as
   well as with Typed Arrays in order to build multi-dimensional arrays

   with constant numbers of elements in the sub-arrays.  The Homogeneous
   Array tag can be used to facilitate the ingestion of homogeneous
   classical CBOR arrays, providing performance advantages even when a
   Typed Array does not apply.

3.1.  Multi-dimensional Array

   Tag:  TBD40

   Data Item:  array (major type 4) of two arrays, one array (major type
      4) of dimensions, and one array (major type 4, a Typed Array, or a
      Homogeneous Array) of elements

   A multi-dimensional array is represented as a tagged array that
   contains two (one-dimensional) arrays.  The first array defines the
   dimensions of the multi-dimensional array (in the sequence of outer
   dimensions towards inner dimensions) while the second array
   represents the contents of the multi-dimensional array.  If the
   second array is itself tagged as a Typed Array then the element type
   of the multi-dimensional array is known to be the same type as that
   of the Typed Array.  Data in the Typed Array byte string consists of
   consecutive values where the last dimension is considered contiguous
   (row-major order).

   Figure 1 shows a declaration of a two-dimensional array in the C
   language, a representation of that in CBOR using both a
   multidimensional array tag and a typed array tag.

   uint16_t a[2][3] = {
     {2, 4, 8},   /* row 0 */
     {4, 16, 256},
   };

   <Tag TBD40> # multi-dimensional array tag
      82       # array(2)
        82      # array(2)
          02     # unsigned(2) 1st Dimension
          03     # unsigned(3) 2nd Dimension
        <Tag TBD65> # uint16 array
          4c     # byte string(12)
            0002 # unsigned(2)
            0004 # unsigned(4)
            0008 # unsigned(8)
            0004 # unsigned(4)
            0010 # unsigned(16)
            0100 # unsigned(256)

   Figure 2 shows the same two-dimensional array using the
   multidimensional array tag in conjunction with a basic CBOR array
   (which, with the small numbers chosen for the example, happens to be
   shorter).

        82      # array(2)

          03     # unsigned(3) 2nd Dimension
        86     # array(6)
          02      # unsigned(2)
          04      # unsigned(4)
          08      # unsigned(8)
          04      # unsigned(4)
          10      # unsigned(16)
          19 0100 # unsigned(256)

   Tag:  TBD1040

   Data Item:  as with tag TBD40

   Note that above arrays are in "row major" order, which is the
   preferred order for the purposes of this specification.  An analogous
   representation that uses "column major" order arrays is provided
   under the tag TBD1040, as illustrated in Figure 3.

   <Tag TBD1040> # multi-dimensional array tag, column major order
      82       # array(2)
        82      # array(2)
          02     # unsigned(2) 1st Dimension
          03     # unsigned(3) 2nd Dimension
        86     # array(6)
          02      # unsigned(2)
          04      # unsigned(4)
          04      # unsigned(4)
          10      # unsigned(16)
          08      # unsigned(8)
          19 0100 # unsigned(256)

3.2.  Homogeneous Array

   Tag:  TBD41

   Data Item:  array (major type 4)

   This tag provides a hint to decoders that the array tagged by it has
   elements that are all of the same application type.  The element type
   of the array is thus determined by the application type of the first
   array element.  This can be used by implementations in strongly typed
   languages while decoding to create native homogeneous arrays of
   specific types instead of ordered lists.

   Which CBOR data items constitute elements of the same application
   type is specific to the application.  However, type systems of
   programming languages have enough commonality that an application
   should be able to create portable homogeneous arrays.

   Figure 4 shows an example for a homogeneous array of booleans in C++
   and CBOR.

   bool boolArray[2] = { true, false };

   <Tag TBD41>  # Homogeneous Array Tag
      82           #array(2)
         F5        # true
         F4        # false

                Figure 4: Homogeneous array in C++ and CBOR

   Figure 5 extends the example with a more complex structure.

   typedef struct {
     bool active;
     int value;
   } foo;
   foo myArray[2] = { {true, 3}, {true, -4} };

   <Tag TBD41>
       82  # array(2)
          82  #  array(2)
                F5  # true
                03  # 3
          82 # array(2)
                F5  # true
                23  # -4

4.  Discussion

   Support for both little- and big-endian representation may seem out
   of character with CBOR, which is otherwise fully big endian.  This
   support is in line with the intended use of the typed arrays and the
   objective not to require conversion of each array element.

   This specification allocates a sizable chunk out of the single-byte
   tag space.  This use of code point space is justified by the wide use
   of typed arrays in data interchange.

   Providing a column-major order variant of the multi-dimensional array
   may seem superfluous to some, and useful to others.  It is cheap to
   define the additional tag so it is available when actually needed.
   Allocating it out of a different number space makes the preference
   for row-major evident.

   Applying a Homogeneous Array tag to a Typed Array would be redundant
   and is therefore not provided by the present specification.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate the tags in Table 3, with the present
   document as the specification reference.  (The reserved value is
   reserved for a future revision of typed array tags.)

   The allocations come out of the "specification required" space
   (24..255), with the exception of TBD1040, which comes out of the
   "first come first served" space (256..).

                         Table 3: Values for Tags

   *) TBD40 or TBD1040 data item: second element of outer array in data
   item is native CBOR array (major type 4) or Typed Array (one of Tag
   TBD64..TBD87)

   RFC editor note: Please replace TBDnn by the tag numbers allocated by
   IANA throughout the document and delete this note; this also applies

   to the binary representation TBD0b010 in Section 2.1, which becomes
   0b010 if the numbers are allocated as proposed.  IANA note: To make
   the calculations work, TDB64 to TBD87 need to come from a contiguous
   range the start of which is divisible by 32, which they do if the
   "TBD" is simply removed.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of RFC 7049 apply; special attention is
   drawn to the second paragraph of Section 8 of RFC 7049.  The tags
   introduced here are not expected to raise security considerations
   beyond those.

Contributors

   Glenn Engel suggested the tags for multi-dimensional arrays and
   homogeneous arrays, Jim Schaad reminded us that column-major order
   still is in use.
