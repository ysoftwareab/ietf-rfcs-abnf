 Internet-Draft     Application Loss Pattern Metrics        March, 2007 
  
 Abstract 
     
    Using the one-way loss pattern metrics defined in RFC 3357, this 
    document defines two new metrics Type-P-One-Way-Complete-Frame-Loss 
    and Type-P-One-Way-Partial-Frame-Received to provide a better 
    understanding of the affects of packet loss at the application 
    level. The statistic Type-P-One-Way-Errored-Seconds is derived from 
    the above metrics to compute the affect of packet loss at the 
    application level.

 1. Introduction 
  
  
    RFC 2680 defines a one-way packet loss metric across Internet 
    paths. RFC 3357 uses the base loss metric defined in RFC 2680 and 
    defines two derived metrics "loss distance" and "loss period", and 
    the associated statistics that together capture the loss patterns 
    experienced by packet streams on the Internet. These metrics have 
    proved to be very useful in understanding the performance of 
    various real-time applications such as packet voice and video when 
    delivered over the Internet.

 Internet-Draft     Application Loss Pattern Metrics        March, 2007 
  
     
    However, for many real-time applications the loss patterns that are 
    more salient to the user experience are losses that an application 
    sees rather than the more basic packet level loss. For example, in 
    a video conferencing application, the loss of a given IP packet 
    carrying video affects one or more video frames at the application 
    level. Understanding the effects of the loss at the application 
    level provides the framework to talk about user experience both for 
    end-users and operators. As such, this draft extends the loss 
    pattern metrics defined in RFC 3357 to the application level. 
     
     
 2. Terminology 
  
  
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
    this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
     
     
 3. Motivation 
     
     
    In typical IPTV applications, the payload format specified in 
    [RFC2250] for MPEG1/MPEG2 Video is used. The MPEG Transport stream 
    is encapsulated within the RTP payload. The RTP payload contains an 
    integral number of MPEG2 transport packets. Each transport packet 
    is 188 bytes in size. Multiple transport packets from various 
    elementary streams such as audio, video, and data are combined in 
    the transport stream and carried within a single RTP packet. The 
    packet loss metrics defined in [RFC3357] provide the mechanism to 
    understand the loss at the RTP level. However, from the user 
    perspective it is more meaningful to understand for example how the 
    loss affects a video frame. 
     
    In video conferencing applications that use RTP as the transport 
    protocol, a video frame may have to be broken into smaller units to 
    fit into the RTP payload. The last unit of the frame is identified 
    using a frame marker bit. The metrics in [RFC3357] again provide 
    loss pattern information for the RTP packets, but from the 
    application perspective it is more useful to know how the loss of a 
    single packet affects a video frame. 
     
    The new metrics defined in this draft extend the [RFC3357] metrics 
    to the application space so that there is a better understanding at 
    the application level on the impacts of packet loss at lower 
    levels.

 4. Frame Metrics 
     
     
 4.1 Metric Names 
     
 4.1.1 Type-P-One-Way-Complete-Frame-Loss 
 4.1.2 Type-P-One-Way-Partial-Frame-Received 
  
 4.2 Metric Parameters 
     
    + Src, the IP address of a host 
    + Dst, the IP address of a host 
    + Ts, a start time 
    + Te, an end time 
     
 4.3 Metric Units 
     
    The value of a Type-P-One-Way-Complete-Frame-Loss is either a zero 
    (signifying the some or all of the frame was received) or one 
    (signifying loss). The value of a Type-P-One-Way-Partial-Frame-
    Received is one (signifying that a partial frame was received) or 
    zero (signifying a complete frame was received). 
     
 4.4 Definitions 
     
    The *Type-P-One-Way-Complete-Frame-Loss* from Src to Dst between 
    times Ts and Te is 0 means the Src sent the first bits of all the 
    Type-P packets that belong to the frame to Dst between times Ts and 
    Te, and that the Dst received all the packets.  
     
    The *Type-P-One-Way-Partial-Frame-Received* from Src to Dst between 
    times Ts and Te is 1 means that the Src sent the first bits of all 
    the Type-P packets that belong to the frame to Dst between times Ts 
    and Te, and the Dst received at least one but not all of the 
    packets.  
     
      
 5. Stream Metrics 
  
    The following metrics and the derived statistics are an extension 
    of the packet level metrics defined in [RFC3357] to media frames at 
    the application level. 
  
 5.1 Metric Names

 Internet-Draft     Application Loss Pattern Metrics        March, 2007 
  
 5.1.1 Type-P-One-Way-Media-Loss-Distance-Stream 
  
 5.1.2 Type-P-One-Way-Media-Loss-Period-Stream 
  
 5.2 Metric Parameters 
     
    + Src, the IP address of a host 
    + Dst, the IP address of a host 
    + Ts, a start time 
    + Te, an end time 
     
 5.3 Metric Units 
     
 5.3.1 Type-P-One-Way-Media-Loss-Distance-Stream 
  
    A sequence of pairs of the form <media loss distance, media loss>, 
    where media loss is derived from Type-P-One-Way-Complete-Frame-Loss 
    and Type-P-One-Way-Partial-Frame-Received and loss distance is 
    either zero or a positive integer. 
     
 5.3.2 Type-P-One-Way-Media-Loss-Period-Stream 
  
    A sequence of pairs of the form <media loss period, media loss> 
    where media loss is derived from Type-P-One-Way-Complete-Frame-Loss 
    and Type-P-One-Way-Partial-Frame-Received and loss period is an 
    integer. 
     
 6. Statistics 
  
 6.1 Type-P-One-Way-Media-Loss-Noticeable-Rate 
     
    A media frame loss is defined as 'noticeable' if the distance 
    between the lost frame and the previously lost frame is no greater 
    than delta, a positive integer, where delta is the "loss 
    constraint". 
     
     
 6.2 Type-P-One-Way-Media-Loss-Period-Total 
     
    This represents the total number of media loss periods, and can be 
    derived from the Type-P-One-Way-Media-Loss-Period-Stream. This is 
    given by the maximum value of the first entry of the set of pairs, 
    <media loss period, media loss>, representing the media loss metric 
    Type-P-One-Way-Media-Loss-Period-Stream. 
     
     
 6.3 Type-P-One-Way-Media-Loss-Period-Lengths

 Internet-Draft     Application Loss Pattern Metrics        March, 2007 
  
    This statistic is a sequence of pairs <media loss periods, length>, 
    with the media loss period entry ranging from 1 to Type-P-One-Way-
    Media-Loss-Period-Total.  
     
     
 6.4 Type-P-One-Way-Errored-Media-Seconds 
     
    This metric is directly devied from Type-P-One-Way-Complete-Frame-
    Loss and Type-P-One-Way-Partial-Frame-Received as the number of 
    errored seconds over a given period of time. It is computed by 
    determining for each frame in the time period, if the frame was 
    completely lost, or partially lost, or not lost at all. For each of 
    the frames that are either completely or partially lost, the amount 
    of time that the loss is spread out is computed and added to 
    determine Type-P-One-Way-Errored-Seconds. 
     
     
 7. Security Considerations 
     
     
    The security considerations of [RFC2680] and [RFC3357] apply. 
     
     
 8. IANA Considerations 
     
     
    Since this document does not define a specific protocol, nor does 
    it define any well-known values, there are no IANA considerations 
    for this document.
