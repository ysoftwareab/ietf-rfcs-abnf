INTERNET DRAFT          EVPN L3VPN Multi-homing         October 19, 2015


1  Introduction

   [RFC7432] defines EVPN, a solution for multipoint Layer 2 Virtual
   Private Network (L2VPN) services, with advanced multi-homing
   capabilities, using BGP for distributing customer/client MAC address
   reachability information over the core MPLS/IP network. [EVPN-IRB]
   and [EVPN-PREFIX] discuss how EVPN can be used to support inter-
   subnet forwarding among hosts across different IP subnets, while
   maintaining the redundancy capabilities of the original solution.

   In this document, we discuss how EVPN can be used to offer a multi-
   homed L3VPN service leveraging its Layer 2 access redundancy. The
   solution offers a single IP peer to the Customer Edge (CE) nodes,
   rapid failure detection, minimal fail-over time and make-before-break
   paradigm for maintenance.

   MPLS Access Network. The MPLS Access Network includes Access PEs (A-
   PEs) and MPLS P nodes (not shown for simplicity). The A-PEs provide a
   Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) to the connected CEs using
   Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS) pseudowires per [RFC5462]. The access
   pseudowires terminate on the service PEs (S-PE1, S-PE2,..., S-PEr).
   The Service PEs (S-PEs) provide inter-subnet forwarding between the
   CEs, i.e. L3VPN service between them. To provide redundancy,
   pseudowires from a given A-PE can terminate on two or more S-PEs
   forming a Redundancy Group. This provide multi-homed interconnect of
   A-PEs to S-PEs.

   The solution MUST support the following requirements:

   - The S-PEs in a redundancy group must provide single-active
   redundancy to the CEs, i.e. only one S-PE is actively forwarding
   traffic at any given point of time. 

   - The SPEs in a redundancy group must appear as a single IP peer to
   the CE, and a single eBGP session will be established between a given
   CE and its associated S-PEs.

   - In the case of S-PE failure, pseudowire failure or S-PE isolation
   from access network, the fail-over time should be minimized by
   optimizing both the backup pseudowire establishment as well as the
   BGP convergence time. This reduces the amount of traffic loss as the
   active path reroutes to one of the backup S-PEs.

   - The active S-PE must be able to quickly detect pseudowire failures
   or its isolation from the access MPLS network by means of a proactive
   monitoring mechanism.

   - For system maintenance, it should be possible to support a make-
   before-break paradigm, where the backup path is in warm standby state
   before a given active S-PE is taken offline for service.

3 Challenges with L3VPN Multi-homing

   The requirements depicted in section 2 above, especially the
   requirement to maintain a single eBGP session between the CE and the
   S-PEs, introduce challenges for standard L3VPN multi-homing
   solutions. In particular, the BGP prefix independent convergence
   (PIC) solution [BGP-PIC] cannot be used here because the backup S-PEs
   have no means of learning the IP prefixes from the CE: recall that
   the CE will only have an active eBGP session with the active S-PE. As
   a result, when the primary S-PE fails, the backup S-PE will have no
   alternate paths to the prefixes advertised by the CE. Therefore, with
   BGP PIC it is not possible to address the fast fail-over requirement.

4 Solution

   The solution involves running EVPN on the S-PEs in single-active
   redundancy mode albeit for inter-subnet forwarding (i.e. Layer 3
   forwarding). All pseudowires associated with a given CE are
   considered collectively as a Virtual Ethernet Segment (vES) [Virtual-
   ES] from the EVPN PEs perspective.

   In the MPLS access network, pseudowire redundancy mechanisms are used
   [RFC6718][RFC6870] in either the Independent mode or the Master/Slave
   mode, with the S-PEs acting as the Master. The EVPN Designated
   Forwarder (DF) election mechanism is used to identify the active and
   standby S-PEs, and the pseudowire Preferential Forwarding Status Bit
   [RFC6870], for the access pseudowires, is derived from the outcome of
   the DF election, as follows:

   - The S-PE that is elected as DF for a given vES MUST advertise
   Active in the Preferential Forwarding Status bit over the pseudowire
   corresponding to the vES.

   - The SPE that is elected as non-DF for a given vES MUST advertise
   Standby in the Preferential Forwarding Status bit over the pseudowire
   corresponding to the vES.

   On the S-PEs, the pseudowires from the Access PEs are terminated onto
   VRFs, such that all pseudowires within a given redundancy set
   terminate on a single IP endpoint on the S-PEs. To achieve this, the
   S-PEs in a given Redundancy Group are configured with the same
   Anycast IP and MAC addresses on the virtual (sub)interface
   corresponding to the VRF termination point.

   Since the S-PEs are running in EVPN single-active redundancy mode,
   the S-PEs would advertise an Ethernet AD route per vES with the
   single-active flag set per [RFC7432]. Since only the DF S-PE has its
   access pseudowire in Active state, only that device would establish
   an eBGP session with the CE and receive control and data traffic. The
   DF S-PE advertises host prefixes that it receives, from the CE over
   the eBGP session, to other PEs in the EVI using EVPN route type-5,
   with the proper ESI set. Remote PEs learn the host prefixes and
   associate them with the ESI, using the advertising PE as the next-hop
   for forwarding.

   Other S-PEs in the same Redundancy Group as the advertising PE will
   receive the same EVPN route type-5 advertisement, and will recognize
   the associated ESI as a locally attached vES. This information will
   be used in the case of failure to provide a backup path to the CE. In
   other words, the S-PEs in the same Redundancy Group, use EVPN
   Aliasing procedure to synchronzie their IP-VRFs among themselves. It

INTERNET DRAFT          EVPN L3VPN Multi-homing         October 19, 2015


   is worth noting here that the S-PEs in the Redundancy Group will have
   their ARP caches synchronized through the EVPN route type-2
   advertisements from the DF PE.

5 Failure Scenarios

5.1 Pseudowire Failure

   The active (DF) S-PE can proactively monitor the health of the
   primary pseudowire by using a pseudowire OAM mechanism such as VCCV-
   BFD. As such, the S-PE can detect the failure of the primary
   pseudowire, and react by withdrawing both the Ethernet Segment route
   as well as the Ethernet A-D route associated with the vES. Note that
   the S-PE advertises the Ethernet A-D route per vES granularity as
   well as the Ethernet A-D per EVI. The withdrawal of the Ethernet
   Segment route serves as an indication to the backup S-PE to go active
   (i.e. act as a backup DF), and activate its pseudowires to the Access
   PE. The withdrawal of the Ethernet A-D route triggers a "mass
   withdraw" on the remote PEs: these PEs adjust their next-hop
   associated with the prefixes that were originally advertised by the
   failed PE to point to the "backup path" per [RFC7432]. This provides
   relatively fast convergence because only a single message per
   Ethernet Segment is required for the remote PEs to switch over to the
   backup path irrespective of how many prefixes were learnt from the CE
   over the pseudowire. Also, note that no synchronization of VRF or ARP
   tables is required between the primary S-PE and its backup S-PE
   during the fail-over, because these tables were populated ahead of
   time during the original EVPN route advertisements.

   As a result of the pseudowire failure, the eBGP session between the
   CE and the original DF PE will time out. This will cause said S-PE to
   start a timer in order to defer withdrawing the EVPN type-5 and type-
   2 routes that it had advertised for the prefixes learnt over the
   session from the CE. As the backup pseudowire to the backup DF PE
   goes active, the eBGP session will be re-established by the CE with
   the backup PE. Since both PEs share the same Anycast IP and MAC
   addresses, the CE does not recognize that it is in communication with
   a different PE.

   To minimize disruption in data forwarding on the CE and the backup
   PE, the non-stop forwarding feature such as BGP Graceful Restart is
   used. Since the end-point IP address has not changed, this eBGP
   session handover between the primary S-PE and the backup S-PE, looks
   like a eBGP session flap with respect to the CE. Thus, the CE
   continues its packet forwarding operation in data-plane while
   synchronizing its control-plane with the backup S-PE.

5.2 PE Node Failure

   In the case of PE node failure, the operation is similar to the steps
   described above, albeit that EVPN route withdrawals are performed by
   the Route Reflector instead of the PE.
