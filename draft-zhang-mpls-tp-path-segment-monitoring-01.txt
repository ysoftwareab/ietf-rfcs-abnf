Internet-Draft           Path Segment Monitoring            October 2010


1.  Introduction

   In order to monitor, protect and manage a portion (i.e. segment or
   concatenated segment) of a transport path, a path segment is defined
   between the edges of the portion of the LSP that needs to be
   monitored, protected or managed.  If this path segment is created as
   a hierarchical LSP, it is called SPME (Sub-Path Maintenance Element).

   SPMEs are usually instantiated when the transport path is created by
   either the management plane or control plane for proactive
   monitoring.  However, pre-design and pre-configuration of all the
   considered patterns of SPME are not sometimes preferable in real
   operation due to the burden of design works, a number of header
   consumptions, bandwidth consumption and so on, as described in setion
   3.8 of [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-oam-framework].

   There are different schemes to configure SPMEs after the transport
   path has been created, and two network objectives SHOULD be met:

   1.  The monitoring and maintenance of existing transport paths has to
   be conducted in service without traffic disruption.

   2.  The monitored or managed transport path condition has to be
   exactly the same irrespective of any configurations necessary for
   maintenance.

   Here we will discuss the the advantages and disadvantages of
   different potential schemes.

3.  Path Segment Monitoring Analysis

3.1.  MBB

   The make-before-break (MBB) procedures which are supported by MPLS
   allow the creation of a SPME on existing LSPs in-service without
   traffic disruption, as described in [RFC5921].  An SPME can be
   defined corresponding to one or more end-to-end LSPs at firt, then
   new end-to-end LSPsthat are tunneled within the SPME can be set up,
   which may require coordination across administrative boundaries,
   finally traffic of the existing LSPs is switched over to the new end-

   to-end tunneled LSPs.  The old end-to-end LSPs can then be torn down.
   See the figure below, copied from [RFC5921]:

     |LERx|--|LSRy|-+                                        +-|LSRz|--|LERt|
                    |                                        |
                    |  |----------- Carrier 1 ------------|  |
                    |  +-----+   +----+   +----+    +-----+  |
                    +--|     |---|    |---|    |----|     |--+
                       |LER1 |   |LSR3|   |LSR4|    |LER2 |
                    +--|     |---|    |---|    |----|     |--+
                    |  +-----+   +----+   +----+    +-----+  |
                    |  |============ SPME ================|  |
     |LERa|--|LSRb|-+            (Carrier 1)                 +-|LSRc|--|LERd|


            Figure 1: SPME for a set of transport path segments

   In the MBB schemes, LER1 needs to inform the old LSPs's ingress nodes
   (for example, LERx and LERa) that a SPME has been setup to monitor
   the segment between LER1 and LER2, so that LERx/LERa can instantiate
   the new LSPs.  However, the coordination schemes across
   administrative boundaries are not explicitly described in [RFC5921].

   [RFC4736] gives the RSVP-TE extension to realize reoptimization of
   MPLS TE Loosely Routed LSP.  It is said that when a mid-point LSR
   whose next hop is a loose hop or an abstract node canlocally trigger
   a path re-evaluation when a configurable timer expires, some specific
   events occur (e.g., link-up event), or the user explicitly requests
   it.  If a preferable path is found, the LSR sends an RSVP PathErr to
   the head-end LSR (Error code 25 (Notify), Error sub-code=6
   ("preferable path exists")).  Although SPME can be seen as a new
   link, the ingress nodes do know that they need to be triggered to
   establish new LSPs.  In order to differentiate the cases between SPME
   and reoptimization, the new value "SPME up" is suggested to be
   assigned.

   As we can see, network objective (1) can be met, but network
   objective (2) can not be met due to the new assignment of MPLS
   labels.

3.2.  Local Rerouting

   A bidirectional LSP1(LERx-LSRy-LER1-LSR3-LSR4-LER2-LSRz-LERt)exists
   between LERx and LERt, the forwarding label values along LERx->LERt
   direction are Lyx-L1y-L31-L43-L24-Lz2-Ltz, and the forwarding label
   values along LERt->LERx direction are Lxy-Ly1-L13-L34-L42-L2z-Lzt.
   Assuming that SPME1 (LER1-LSR3-LSR4- LER2) is established to monitor
   this LSP, in order to restrict the operation in the scope of Carrier

   1, local rerouting technology described in [RFC4090] can be used
   here.

   LER1 uses the label L24 as the inner label and pushes it into SPME1,
   LER2 uses the label L13 as the inner label and pushes it into SPME1.
   But LER1 (LER2) needs to learn L24 (L13), which can be learned by the
   following procedures:

   When SPME1 is up, LER1 pushes LSP1's Path message into SPME1, the
   next hop is changed from LSR3 to LER2, upstream label unchanged (L13
   is allocated to LER2).  Similarly, LER2 pushes LSP1's Resv message
   into SPME1, the next hop is changed from LSR4 to LER1, and Label
   unchanged (L24 is allocated to LER1).  After LER1 (LER2) has learned
   the inner label value L24 (L13), it can push the user traffic into
   SPME1.

   If LSP1 is unidirectional, LER1 pushes LSP1's Path message into
   SPME1, the next hop is changed from LSR3 to LER2.  But for Resv
   message, the next of LER2 is changed from LSR4 to LER1, and it needs
   to be transmitted hop by hop.

   Local rerouting is more optimized compared to MBB, for the new
   assigned labels just exist in the scope of Carrier 1, but it still
   can not fully math the requirements of network objective (2).

3.3.  TTL TLV

   In order to totally meet the requirements of network objective (2),
   the schemes based on non-label stack are needed.

   TTL TLV, as one of the optional ACH TLV objects, is defined in
   [I-D.boutros-mpls-lsp-ping-ttl-tlv], which is used to inform the
   receiver how many hops away the originator is on the path of the
   MS-PW or Bidirectional LSP.  It can be used to realize path segment
   monitoring also, see the figure below.

                                   F--------G
                                  /           \
                     A-----B-----C--*----D------E------Z


                         Figure 2: TTL TLV for PSM

   The path segment PS1 (C-D-E) of LSP1 (A-B-C-D-E-Z) needs to be
   provisioned.  Node C, as the MEP node of PS1, sends OAM message (like
   CC/CV, PM loss/dely, etc.) to node D, the TTL TLV MUST be inserted.
   TTL value is set to the hop counts from E to C, here it is 2 (if LSP1
   is an associated bidirectional LSP, the hops form E to C maybe not be



Zhang, et al.            Expires April 28, 2011                 [Page 5]

   2).  In this way, node E can use the hops carried in TTL TLV to
   response the OAM message.

   The TTL values can be configured by NMS, or learned by control plane.
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-tp-identifiers] describes the MEP-ID of Pseudowire
   Segments, and the MEP configuration of path Segments can be defined
   similarly.  That is to say, the MEP_ID of path segment can be formed
   by a combination of a LSP MEP_ID and the identification of the local
   node, such as "Src-Global_ID::Src-Node_ID::Src-
   Tunnel_Num::LSP_Num::PS-Global_ID::PS-Node_ID".

3.3.1.  The scaling Analysis

   Assuming there is another path segment PS2 that exists between node B
   and E, proactive and on-demand OAM messages are running between B and
   E also.  Just like PS1, the TTL TLV MUST be inserted, and the value
   is the hop counts from E to B (here it is 3).  At some time, a defect
   happens between node C and D, the customer traffic would be switched
   from PS1 to the backup path(C---F---G---E).  However, node B may not
   know that node C has switched all the traffic to the backup path, and
   in this case, node E can not receive the OAM message sent by node B
   and may make wrong decision.

   In conclusion, TTL TLV scheme can meet both the two network
   objectives.  But it can not be used if two or more path segments are
   nested.


4.   IANA Considerations

   A new error sub-code values for the RSVP PathErr Notify message
   (Error code=25) is required in this document:

   Error sub-code=TBD by IANA: "SPME up".


5.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
