      INFORMATIVE NOTE: DKIM-Quoted-Printable differs from Quoted-
      Printable as defined in [RFC2045] in several important ways:

      1.  Whitespace in the input text, including CR and LF, must be
          encoded.  [RFC2045] does not require such encoding, and does
          not permit encoding of CR or LF characters that are part of a
          CRLF line break.

      2.  Whitespace in the encoded text is ignored.  This is to allow
          tags encoded using DKIM-Quoted-Printable to be wrapped as
          needed.  In particular, [RFC2045] requires that line breaks in
          the input be represented as physical line breaks; that is not
          the case here.

      3.  The "soft line break" syntax ("=" as the last non-whitespace
          character on the line) does not apply.

      4.  DKIM-Quoted-Printable does not require that encoded lines be
          no more than 76 characters long (although there may be other
          requirements depending on the context in which the encoded
          text is being used).

v= Version (plain-text; REQUIRED).  This tag defines the version of
      this specification that applies to the signature record.  It MUST
      have the value "1" for implementations compliant with this version
      of DKIM.

      ABNF:

sig-v-tag       = %x76 [FWS] "=" [FWS] 1*DIGIT

         INFORMATIVE NOTE: DKIM-Signature version numbers may increase
         arithmetically as new versions of this specification are
         released.

a= The algorithm used to generate the signature (plain-text;
      REQUIRED).  Verifiers MUST support "rsa-sha1" and "rsa-sha256";
      Signers SHOULD sign using "rsa-sha256".  See Section 3.3 for a
      description of the algorithms.

b= The signature data (base64; REQUIRED).  Whitespace is ignored in
      this value and MUST be ignored when reassembling the original
      signature.  In particular, the signing process can safely insert
      FWS in this value in arbitrary places to conform to line-length
      limits.  See "Signer Actions" (Section 5) for how the signature is
      computed.

bh=  The hash of the canonicalized body part of the message as
      limited by the "l=" tag (base64; REQUIRED).  Whitespace is ignored
      in this value and MUST be ignored when reassembling the original
      signature.  In particular, the signing process can safely insert
      FWS in this value in arbitrary places to conform to line-length
      limits.  See Section 3.7 for how the body hash is computed.

      ABNF:

c= Message canonicalization (plain-text; OPTIONAL, default is
      "simple/simple").  This tag informs the Verifier of the type of
      canonicalization used to prepare the message for signing.  It
      consists of two names separated by a "slash" (%d47) character,
      corresponding to the header and body canonicalization algorithms,
      respectively.  These algorithms are described in Section 3.4.  If
      only one algorithm is named, that algorithm is used for the header
      and "simple" is used for the body.  For example, "c=relaxed" is
      treated the same as "c=relaxed/simple".

      ABNF:

sig-c-tag       = %x63 [FWS] "=" [FWS] sig-c-tag-alg
                        ["/" sig-c-tag-alg]

x-sig-c-tag-alg = hyphenated-word    ; for later extension

d= The SDID claiming responsibility for an introduction of a message
      into the mail stream (plain-text; REQUIRED).  Hence, the SDID
      value is used to form the query for the public key.  The SDID MUST
      correspond to a valid DNS name under which the DKIM key record is
      published.  The conventions and semantics used by a Signer to
      create and use a specific SDID are outside the scope of this
      specification, as is any use of those conventions and semantics.
      When presented with a signature that does not meet these
      requirements, Verifiers MUST consider the signature invalid.

      Internationalized domain names MUST be encoded as A-labels, as
      described in Section 2.3 of [RFC5890].

      ABNF:

h= Signed header fields (plain-text, but see description; REQUIRED).
      A colon-separated list of header field names that identify the
      header fields presented to the signing algorithm.  The field MUST
      contain the complete list of header fields in the order presented
      to the signing algorithm.  The field MAY contain names of header
      fields that do not exist when signed; nonexistent header fields do
      not contribute to the signature computation (that is, they are
      treated as the null input, including the header field name, the
      separating colon, the header field value, and any CRLF
      terminator).  The field MAY contain multiple instances of a header
      field name, meaning multiple occurrences of the corresponding
      header field are included in the header hash.  The field MUST NOT
      include the DKIM-Signature header field that is being created or
      verified but may include others.  Folding whitespace (FWS) MAY be
      included on either side of the colon separator.  Header field
      names MUST be compared against actual header field names in a
      case-insensitive manner.  This list MUST NOT be empty.  See
      Section 5.4 for a discussion of choosing header fields to sign and
      Section 5.4.2 for requirements when signing multiple instances of
      a single field.

      ABNF:

sig-h-tag       = %x68 [FWS] "=" [FWS] hdr-name
                         *( [FWS] ":" [FWS] hdr-name )

         INFORMATIVE EXPLANATION: By "signing" header fields that do not
         actually exist, a Signer can allow a Verifier to detect
         insertion of those header fields after signing.  However, since
         a Signer cannot possibly know what header fields might be
         defined in the future, this mechanism cannot be used to prevent
         the addition of any possible unknown header fields.

         INFORMATIVE NOTE: "Signing" fields that are not present at the
         time of signing not only prevents fields and values from being
         added but also prevents adding fields with no values.

i= The Agent or User Identifier (AUID) on behalf of which the SDID is
      taking responsibility (dkim-quoted-printable; OPTIONAL, default is
      an empty local-part followed by an "@" followed by the domain from
      the "d=" tag).

      The syntax is a standard email address where the local-part MAY be
      omitted.  The domain part of the address MUST be the same as, or a
      subdomain of, the value of the "d=" tag.

      Internationalized domain names MUST be encoded as A-labels, as
      described in Section 2.3 of [RFC5890].

      ABNF:

sig-i-tag       = %x69 [FWS] "=" [FWS] [ Local-part ]
                                 "@" domain-name

l= Body length count (plain-text unsigned decimal integer; OPTIONAL,
      default is entire body).  This tag informs the Verifier of the
      number of octets in the body of the email after canonicalization
      included in the cryptographic hash, starting from 0 immediately
      following the CRLF preceding the body.  This value MUST NOT be
      larger than the actual number of octets in the canonicalized
      message body.  See further discussion in Section 8.2.

         INFORMATIVE NOTE: The value of the "l=" tag is constrained to
         76 decimal digits.  This constraint is not intended to predict
         the size of future messages or to require implementations to
         use an integer representation large enough to represent the
         maximum possible value but is intended to remind the
         implementer to check the length of this and all other tags
         during verification and to test for integer overflow when
         decoding the value.  Implementers may need to limit the actual
         value expressed to a value smaller than 10^76, e.g., to allow a
         message to fit within the available storage space.

      ABNF:

sig-l-tag    = %x6c [FWS] "=" [FWS]
                     1*76DIGIT

q= A colon-separated list of query methods used to retrieve the
      public key (plain-text; OPTIONAL, default is "dns/txt").  Each
      query method is of the form "type[/options]", where the syntax and
      semantics of the options depend on the type and specified options.
      If there are multiple query mechanisms listed, the choice of query
      mechanism MUST NOT change the interpretation of the signature.
      Implementations MUST use the recognized query mechanisms in the
      order presented.  Unrecognized query mechanisms MUST be ignored.

      Currently, the only valid value is "dns/txt", which defines the
      DNS TXT resource record (RR) lookup algorithm described elsewhere
      in this document.  The only option defined for the "dns" query
      type is "txt", which MUST be included.  Verifiers and Signers MUST
      support "dns/txt".

s= The selector subdividing the namespace for the "d=" (domain) tag
      (plain-text; REQUIRED).

      Internationalized selector names MUST be encoded as A-labels, as
      described in Section 2.3 of [RFC5890].

      ABNF:

sig-s-tag    = %x73 [FWS] "=" [FWS] selector

t= Signature Timestamp (plain-text unsigned decimal integer;
      RECOMMENDED, default is an unknown creation time).  The time that
      this signature was created.  The format is the number of seconds
      since 00:00:00 on January 1, 1970 in the UTC time zone.  The value
      is expressed as an unsigned integer in decimal ASCII.  This value
      is not constrained to fit into a 31- or 32-bit integer.
      Implementations SHOULD be prepared to handle values up to at least
      10^12 (until approximately AD 200,000; this fits into 40 bits).
      To avoid denial-of-service attacks, implementations MAY consider
      any value longer than 12 digits to be infinite.  Leap seconds are
      not counted.  Implementations MAY ignore signatures that have a
      timestamp in the future.

      ABNF:

sig-t-tag    = %x74 [FWS] "=" [FWS] 1*12DIGIT

x= Signature Expiration (plain-text unsigned decimal integer;
      RECOMMENDED, default is no expiration).  The format is the same as
      in the "t=" tag, represented as an absolute date, not as a time
      delta from the signing timestamp.  The value is expressed as an
      unsigned integer in decimal ASCII, with the same constraints on
      the value in the "t=" tag.  Signatures MAY be considered invalid
      if the verification time at the Verifier is past the expiration
      date.  The verification time should be the time that the message
      was first received at the administrative domain of the Verifier if
      that time is reliably available; otherwise, the current time
      should be used.  The value of the "x=" tag MUST be greater than
      the value of the "t=" tag if both are present.

         INFORMATIVE NOTE: The "x=" tag is not intended as an anti-
         replay defense.

         INFORMATIVE NOTE: Due to clock drift, the receiver's notion of
         when to consider the signature expired may not exactly match
         what the sender is expecting.  Receivers MAY add a 'fudge
         factor' to allow for such possible drift.

      ABNF:

sig-x-tag    = %x78 [FWS] "=" [FWS]
                                    1*12DIGIT

z= Copied header fields (dkim-quoted-printable, but see description;
      OPTIONAL, default is null).  A vertical-bar-separated list of
      selected header fields present when the message was signed,
      including both the field name and value.  It is not required to
      include all header fields present at the time of signing.  This
      field need not contain the same header fields listed in the "h="
      tag.  The header field text itself must encode the vertical bar
      ("|", %x7C) character (i.e., vertical bars in the "z=" text are
      meta-characters, and any actual vertical bar characters in a
      copied header field must be encoded).  Note that all whitespace
      must be encoded, including whitespace between the colon and the
      header field value.  After encoding, FWS MAY be added at arbitrary
      locations in order to avoid excessively long lines; such
      whitespace is NOT part of the value of the header field and MUST
      be removed before decoding.

      The header fields referenced by the "h=" tag refer to the fields
      in the [RFC5322] header of the message, not to any copied fields
      in the "z=" tag.  Copied header field values are for diagnostic
      use.

      indicates that an ASN.1 DER-encoded [ITU-X660-1997] RSAPublicKey
      (see [RFC3447], Sections 3.1 and A.1.1) is being used in the "p="
      tag.  (Note: the "p=" tag further encodes the value using the
      base64 algorithm.)  Unrecognized key types MUST be ignored.

v= Version of the DKIM key record (plain-text; RECOMMENDED, default
      is "DKIM1").  If specified, this tag MUST be set to "DKIM1"
      (without the quotes).  This tag MUST be the first tag in the
      record.  Records beginning with a "v=" tag with any other value
      MUST be discarded.  Note that Verifiers must do a string
      comparison on this value; for example, "DKIM1" is not the same as
      "DKIM1.0".

n= Notes that might be of interest to a human (qp-section; OPTIONAL,
      default is empty).  No interpretation is made by any program.
      This tag should be used sparingly in any key server mechanism that

         INFORMATIVE RATIONALE: If a private key has been compromised or
         otherwise disabled (e.g., an outsourcing contract has been
         terminated), a Signer might want to explicitly state that it
         knows about the selector, but all messages using that selector

         should fail verification.  Verifiers SHOULD return an error
         code for any DKIM-Signature header field with a selector
         referencing a revoked key.  (See Section 6.1.2 for details.)

         INFORMATIVE NOTE: A base64string is permitted to include
         whitespace (FWS) at arbitrary places; however, any CRLFs must
         be followed by at least one WSP character.  Implementers and
         administrators are cautioned to ensure that selector TXT RRs
         conform to this specification.

s= Service Type (plain-text; OPTIONAL; default is "*").  A colon-
      separated list of service types to which this record applies.
      Verifiers for a given service type MUST ignore this record if the

      be ignored.  Currently defined service types are as follows:

      *  matches all service types

      email   electronic mail (not necessarily limited to SMTP)

         even should the signature fail to verify.  Verifiers MAY wish
         to track testing mode results to assist the Signer.

      s  Any DKIM-Signature header fields using the "i=" tag MUST have
         the same domain value on the right-hand side of the "@" in the
         "i=" tag and the value of the "d=" tag.  That is, the "i="
         domain MUST NOT be a subdomain of "d=".  Use of this flag is
         RECOMMENDED unless subdomaining is required.

      ABNF:

                         *( [FWS] ":" [FWS] key-t-tag-flag )
key-t-tag-flag   = "y" / "s" / x-key-t-tag-flag
x-key-t-tag-flag = hyphenated-word   ; for future extension
