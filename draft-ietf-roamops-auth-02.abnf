T = Trace. If T=1, then the string represents a trace route request, and
               a RADIUS proxy receiving a Route option set MUST append the domain of
               system from which it received the packet to the end of the Route
               prior to forwarding it.
S = Source route. If S=1 then the string field represents a source route.
L = Loose. If L=1 and S=1, then the string field represents a loose
               source route. If L=0 and S=1, then the route represents a strict source
               route. The combinations S=0, L=1 and T=1, S=1 are not permitted.
R = Reserved.
D = Direction. If D=1, the Route attribute is relevant to an Access-Request or
               Accounting-Request packet; if D=0, the Route attribute is relevant to an
               Access-Reply, Access-Challenge or Accounting-Reply packet.
