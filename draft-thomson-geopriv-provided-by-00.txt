Abstract

   The "provided-by" element in PIDF-LO is a container designed to carry
   information about the source of location information.  This document
   defines an XML structure that can be used within the "provided-by"
   element to convey basic information about the information provider in
   the form of a URI.

Internet-Draft               provided-by URI                October 2005


1.  Introduction

   The PIDF-LO document [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pidf-lo] defines the
   "provided-by" element, which is to be used to identify the
   organization that provided the location information to the endsystem.
   The "provided-by" element is designed to either augment provider
   identity information contained in a digital signature, or provide
   some information in the absence of a signature.  The "provided-by"
   element can also be used to identify an original provider in the case
   where information is made available by a third party.

   The PIDF-LO specification [I-D.ietf-geopriv-pidf-lo] includes a
   definition for a "provided-by" element, that is, for the National
   Emergency Number Association (NENA), which is North America specific.
   This document includes a lightweight definition that is more widely
   applicable.

   The URI form specified in this document provides a loose means of
   identifying the provider of location information to the endsystem.
   It is characterized as "loose" since it the information can only be
   used as a hint, see Section 5 for details.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  provided-by URI

   This document defines "provided-by" content, the "uri" element, that
   can be used to convey URIs.

   A URI provides a very flexible means of conveying information.  To
   that end, this document does not mandate specific processing for the
   "provided-by" element.  A User Agent MAY interpret the "provided-by"
   element in any fashion it considers appropriate, which could simply
   be to ignore the field entirely.  Where URIs are made available, a
   User Agent SHOULD only use any URI on explicit user direction.

   It is RECOMMENDED that, where applicable, any URI included in the
   "provided-by" element be accessible from the public internet without
   requiring authentication.

   There MAY be more than one "uri" element in a PIDF-LO so that
   multiple URIs can be present.  It MAY also be used in combination
   with other "provided-by" content.

2.1.  URI Usage

   URIs included in the "provided-by" element can be used for many
   purposes.  The "type" attribute MAY be included to provide a hint to
   a User Agent about how a URI could be used if it isn't evident from
   the URI scheme.  The following values are defined:

   contact: The URI can be used to contact the providing organization.
      This is similar to the "contact" element defined in PIDF
      [RFC3863].  It is RECOMMENDED that this field include a URI in a
      scheme that can be used for establishing a media session, such as
      sip, sips or tel.

   location: The URI references location information pertaining to the
      organization or the specific campus, which should be in the form
      of a PIDF-LO document.

   info: The URI references general information, which might include
      information on the privacy policy of the organization; an
      explanation of how location information is determined by the
      organization; or any other information.

   No guidance is provided on how URIs are used, however it is expected
   that a User Agent use default handling behavior for each scheme.  For
   instance, an http URI might be passed to a web browser or a sips URI
   might be passed to a SIP UA.

3.  provided-by URI Schema

   The following schema defines a "uri" element that can be used for
   "provided-by" URIs.

4.  Example

   The following example demonstrates the inclusion of multiple URIs in
   the "provided-by" element.


   <?xml version="1.0"?>

             xmlns:uri="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:geopriv10:pb-uri"
             entity="pres:user@example.com">
     <tuple id="example">
       <status>

           <gp:location-info>
             <ca:civicAddress xml:lang="de">

5.  Security Considerations

   The information in the "provided-by" element does not provide any
   assurance that the entity referred to is actually the provider of the
   location information.  Specifically, the contents of a "provided-by"
   element do not provide a cryptographic assertion of identity of any
   nature.

   Unless location information is digitally signed, it is very easy to
   provide fraudulent information within this field.  For example, a
   PIDF-LO from "example.cracker.com" might include a URI to the well-
   known and trusted "example.com" web site.  This attack could be used
   to trick users into thinking that the location information was
   provided by "example.com".

   When a PIDF-LO is not digitally signed by an authenticated and
   sufficiently authorized entity the following restrictions apply:

   o  Users of the information MUST NOT represent any authentication
      information provided when dereferencing the URI as the provider of
      location information.

   o  Users of this information MUST NOT use the information for any
      purpose beyond informational.

   It is RECOMMENDED that a User Agent observe these restrictions even
   when a digital signature is present.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document calls for IANA to register a new XML namespace, as per
   the guidelines in [RFC3688].
