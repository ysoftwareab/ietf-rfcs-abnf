Abstract

   This Memo defines the SkiCal format.

   SkiCal is a machine-readable format for the interchange of enhanced
   yellow-page directory listings.  SkiCal expands the traditional
   property-set of name, address, telephone number and business
   category,  adding structured information about people, places,
   things, activities  and the conditions and terms for interaction with
   resources.  SkiCal provides a structure for information about dates

   and times, directions, rules and recommendations for participation,
   pricing and reservation schemes, access information for those with
   special needs, ownership and responsibilities and promotional
   material.  The referents of these listings, which are both events and
   persistent resources are referred to in this draft as SkiSources.

   SkiCal is based on and extends the iCalendar format as defined by
   RFC-2445, Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object
   Specification [3] (iCalendar).  SkiCal objects are comprised of
   either VEVENT components with the addition of new properties and
   property parameters, or the SkiCal specific VOPTIME calendar
   component described in this memo.

Internet-Draft                   SkiCal                     October 2002


1. Introduction

   SkiCal adapts the iCalendar usage domain of appointments and business
   meetings to the needs of producers, brokers and  end-users of
   resources and services in commerce, tourism, sport, recreation,
   health-care, culture, education etc.  SkiCal users are both
   "TimeSpenders" seeking information about available resources
   (SkiSources) and "Publishers" wishing to make that information
   public.

   Machine-readable directory information serves several purposes;

   1.  The organization of object properties into structures convenient
       for rapid, efficient storage and retrieval.

   2.  The exchange of compatible objects of information across
       divergent platforms

   3.  The facilitation of automatically generated lay-out for print,
       screen and audio representations.

   4.  The facilitation of automatic translation.

   5.  The wide-scale discovery and harvesting of information via the
       Internet with previously unobtainable accuracy.

2. Reading Instructions and Conventions

   This document is intended to be read alongside RFC-2445 [3].  The
   same basic grammar and formatting conventions that apply to iCal,
   also apply to SkiCal.  For the sake of brevity, the syntax and
   clarifications of the data-types, properties and property parameters
   of RFC-2445 will not be repeated here.

   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of RFC-2234 [6].
   Readers intending on implementing the format defined in this memo
   should be familiar with this notation in order to properly interpret
   the specifications.  Also, they MUST be familiar with the iCalendar
   core object specification (RFC-2445 [3]).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].

2.1 SkiCal Terminology

   The following terms are used in this memo:

2.1.1 SkiCal

   The Term "SkiCal" refers to the methodology described in this note.
   Though originally "S K I" reflected the Scandinavian origins of this
   effort, serving as  an  acronym for "Svenska Kalender Initiativet"
   (Swedish Calendar Initiative), this interpretation of the SKi acronym
   was changed in September 2000 so that "S K I"  now stands for  the
   "Structured Knowledge Initiative".  There is no relationship to the
   winter sport "skiing", though of course Skiing events could be
   described using SkiCal.

2.1.2 SkiSource

   The term "SkiSource" is used to denote a resource existing in time
   and space.  A SkiSource could be a restaurant, a clothing store, a
   theatre or individual performance at the theatre, a public drinking
   fountain, a hospital emergency ward, a service station, a radio
   program, a webcast, or any other similar resource.  Today such
   resources are listed in various directories, such as telephone
   catalogs, the entertainment section of newspapers, television and
   radio program guides, Internet guides, tourist brochures, the
   academic schedules of schools, or a community's listing of public
   services.

Internet-Draft                   SkiCal                     October 2002


2.1.3 SkiCal object

   The term "SkiCal object" is used in this memo to denote the calendar
   object description of a SkiSource using the mime-directory format
   described in RFC2445 as follows; "The format for the iCalendar object
   is based on the syntax of the RFC 2425 content type.  While the
   iCalendar object is not a profile of the RFC 2425 content type, it
   does reuse a number of the elements from the RFC 2425 specification."

2.1.4 Publisher

   The term "Publisher" is used in this memo to denote the publisher(s)
   of SkiCal objects.  Publishers could be the owners or producers of a
   SkiSource.  Publishers could be infomediaries making public the
   existence of a SkiSource.

2.1.5 List

   The term "list" is used to denote a pre-published enumeration or
   taxonomy of value-terms.  It is RECOMMENDED that publishers use terms
   from such lists as the values of TEXT type properties in order to
   facilitate the machine readability of their information.  A method
   for referring to such a list is described in this memo.

2.1.6 TimeSpender

   The term "TimeSpender" is used in this memo to denote the end
   consumer or beneficiary of SkiCal information.  SkiCal is structured
   from the view point of the TimeSpender.  A typical SkiCal object
   contains the answers to the most likely questions a TimeSpender might
   ask in order to interact (or make decisions about interacting) with a
   SkiSource.

2.1.7 The 'Wha' Interrogatives

   The new properties introduced in this memo, as well as the original
   properties of RFC2445, are herein sorted by their function as the
   answers to 6 categories of queries.

2.1.7.1 WHAT

   The WHAT property is the place holder for the answers to questions
   such as: What is it? What is happening? What is there? What is it
   called? What people, things and concepts will be involved?

2.1.7.2 WHEN

   The WHEN property is the place holder for the answers to questions

Internet-Draft                   SkiCal                     October 2002


   such as: When will it happen? When is it open? When can I go there?

2.1.7.3 WHERE

   The WHERE property is the place holder for the answers to questions
   such as: Where will it happen? Where is it located?

2.1.7.4 WHOW

   The WHOW property is the place holder for the answers to questions
   such as: How can I attend? How can I join? How can I buy? The word
   "how" is intentionally misspelled to indicate relationship to the
   other interrogatives, all beginning with "WH".

2.1.7.5 WHY

   The WHY property is the place holder for the answers to questions
   such as: Why is this happening? Why is this of interest or value to
   me?

2.1.7.6 WHO

   The WHO property is the place holder for the answers to questions
   such as: Who is the owner? Who is the producer? Who is Responsible?
   Who do I sue?

3. SkiCal specific Property Parameters

   The following SkiCal property parameters are in addition to those
   defined by RFC-2445  Section 4.2 [3] and may be used as specified for
   the individual properties of this memo.


     skicalparameters  =

           / item             ; specifies a specific aspect or resource
                              ; as the subject of a property

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------


3.1 Item

   Parameter Name: ITEM

   Purpose: To specify the name of a specific auxiliary element or part
   of a SkiSource.

   Format Definition: The property parameter is defined by the following
   notation:

       itemparam  = (
                    ( "ITEM" "=" ) / ( "PRXITEM" "=" prefix ":" ) text
                    )

       prefix     = 1*( ) ; one or more characters xxx matching the declared
                            prefix of a NAMESPACE property value

   Description: This parameter identifies particular aspects or parts of
   a SkiSource when it is desirable to make information about such
   aspects or parts known.

   Example:

   BOOKINGS;PRXITEM="SR:Reptile Room":only outside the Reptile Room!
   RECOMMENDED;ITEM="The evening tours":Warm sweater or Jacket
   PROHIBITED;ITEM="During the magic show":Flash cameras
   BOOKINGS;PRXITEM="K:New Years Eve Dinner";OPREF=NYD:
    1-800-256 2222.


3.2 Namespace Reference

   Parameter Name: NSREF

   Purpose: To point to a namespace declaration within the same SkiCal

Internet-Draft                   SkiCal                     October 2002


   object

   Format Definition: The property parameter is defined by the following
   notation:

      nsrefparam  =  NSREF "=" prefix

      prefix      = 1*( ) ;  one or more letters matching the declared
                          ;  prefix of a NAMESPACE property value

   Description: This parameter specifies a prefix that matches a prefix
   declared as a  NAMESPACE property parameter value.  The NSREF
   parameter provides a method for relating the value of the property on
   which it is used to the appropriate namespace.

   It is expected that publishers wishing to optimize interoperability
   will choose values from enumerated lists of value-terms.  These lists
   can be utilized for constraining the values of both properties and
   property parameters.  The declaration for the URI of such a list is
   accomplished using the NAMESPACE property.  The NAMESPACE property
   can also assign a shorthand prefix to the URI value of the NAMESPACE
   and this prefix can be referenced using the NSREF property parameter.

   Example:

   Purpose: To clarify the role of Property values in a SkiCal object.

   The use of the ROLE Property Parameter as defined in RFC-2445 [3]
   Section 4.2.16 Participation Role is constrained to specific
   component properties and specific default values.  To avoid
   incompatibility, SkiCal defines a new property parameter - SKIROLE.

4. SkiCal Specific Property Value Data Types

   The following SkiCal property value datatypes are in addition to
   those defined by RFC-2445  Section 4.2 [3] and may be used as
   specified for the individual properties of this memo.

4.1 The OpeningTimes Set

   An iCalendar VEVENT component can only describe one complete date-
   time set and its eventual recurrences, such as office meetings or
   lunch appointments.  Using the SkiCal OPTIMESET of datetime values;
   OPTERM, OPSEASONS, OPDAYS, OPHOURS and OPMINUTES and OPSECONDS,
   individual SkiCal properties MAY be qualified with date and time
   values.

   For example, through the use of the OPTIMESET a publisher could
   within one calendar object describe not only the general date-times
   of a conference, but also when a refreshment bar was open, the
   telephone times for a help desk, the last date for submitting papers,
   and the opening times of the conference hall itself.

   Or in another example, through the use of this OPTIMESET a publisher
   could within one calendar object describe the operating times of a
   petrol station, differentiating between levels of service such as
   when a mechanic was on duty, when the convenience store was open or
   full service available.

   Formal Definition:

       OPTIMESET         =  "<OPTIME"  OPTIMESETattlist ">"
                            OPTIMESETcontents "</OPTIMESET>"

       OPTIMESETattlist  =  OPTIMESETid

       OPTIMESETid       =  "ID="    idvalue
       idvalue           =  text


    OPTIMESETcontents    =  1*( "OPTERM" / "OPSEASONS" / "OPDAYS" /
                            "OPHOURS" / "OPMINUTES" / "OPSECONDS" )



4.1.1 Terms used in the OPTIMESET data value  declaration

      OPEN: Depending upon the property value being qualified, OPEN may
      indicate open, accessible, in-force, operative, available or any
      comparable state.



FitzPatrick, et al.      Expires April 25, 2003                [Page 14]

Internet-Draft                   SkiCal                     October 2002


      NOT-OPEN: Depending upon the property value being qualified, NOT-
      OPEN may indicate closed, non-accessible, not-in-force, non-
      operative, not-available or any comparable state.

      NOT-DETERMINABLE: Dates and times that can not be determined as
      being open or closed.

      DATE-TIME VALUE PAIR: Two date-time values separated by one or
      more solidus "/" characters.   Value-pairs are either END-
      INCLUSIVE or END-EXCLUSIVE.

      END-INCLUSIVE Value-pairs:  The contents of a SKiCal object are
      formated so as to enable unambiguous machine-readability, but
      there are of course considerable advantages in maintaining human
      readability of the same information.  Unfortunately common date-
      time value pairs can be ambiguous.  If we hear that someone works
      from nine to five, then we can with fairly high probability expect
      her to go home at five o'clock, but if we hear that someone will
      be in town from the first to the 15th, we, with less assuredness,
      might assume that they will leave town on the 16th.  The former
      example is END-EXCLUSIVE while the later is END-INCLUSIVE.

      To facilitate machine-readability it might be convenient to
      mandate that all value-pairs are either END-INCLUSIVE or END-
      EXCLUSIVE, but this memo allows both types, both for the sake of
      human-readability  and the fact that END-EXCLUSIVE value-pairs
      offer an implicit degree of accuracy lacking in END-INCLUSIVE.
      For example END-EXCLUSIVE 170000/180000 is more suitable than END-
      INCLUSIVE 170000//175959.99999 in cases where that sort of
      precision is desirable.  The distinction between these two types
      of value-pairs is made by the number of SOLIDUS characters
      separating the two values.  One SOLIDUS ex: "/" indicates END-
      EXCLUSIVE pairs and two SOLIDUS ex "//" indicate END-INCLUSIVE
      value pairs.

    0105//0110
   START-INCLUSIVE   END-INCLUSIVE  a six day period including the whole of the
   5th day and the whole of the 10th day of January
   0105/0110
   START-INCLUSIVE   END-EXCLUSIVE  a five day period including the whole of the
   5th day and the whole of the 9th day of January

   the following combinations are not currently described in this memo

   START-EXCLUSIVE   END-INCLUSIVE  a five day period
   START-EXCLUSIVE   END-EXCLUSIVE  a four day period

      PERIOD-EXPLICIT / DURATION-EXPLICIT: This SkiCal memo stipulates

Internet-Draft                   SkiCal                     October 2002


      the  use of either period-explicit or duration-explicit value-
      pairs.  Though at first glance the difference  may seem to be only
      representational, these value-pair declarations must not be
      treated as interchangeable.  See below.

      PERIOD-EXPLICIT: A period of time that is defined by a specific
      start and a specific end.

      This means that whenever the start and end of one value-pair are
      designated with different time zone identifiers, or whenever a
      day-light savings change occurs inclusive to the  period , or
      whenever a leap day or leap second occurs inclusive to the period,
      then the duration of the period value will be lengthened or
      shortened accordingly.  The duration can only be determined when
      all possible fluctuations in leap years and leap seconds, day
      light savings schemes and time zone coordinates are accounted for.
      In a period-explicit value-pair the concluding and initiating
      instances of the pair are fixed to whatever politically or
      personally mandated timekeeping is in force for each end of the
      value-pair.

      DURATION-EXPLICIT: A period of time that is defined by a specific
      start coupled to a duration of time or alternatively a specific
      end coupled to a duration of time.

      In a duration-explicit value pair, the duration is fixed and can
      always be calculated as a number of seconds.  The start or the end
      date-times of the duration-explicit value-pair can only be
      determined when all possible fluctuations in leap years and leap
      seconds, day light savings schemes and time zone coordinates are
      accounted for.

      This means that whenever a day-light savings change is inclusive
      to the resulting period value, or whenever a leap day or leap
      second is inclusive to the period value, then the duration of the
      period value will be maintained and the start - alternatively end,
      date-time of the period will be moved forward or backwards in time
      accordingly.  Since no timezone identifier can be concatenated to
      the duration value, a duration-explicit date-time value can only
      be referenced to one timezone.

      TWO USES of ISO8601 TIME-DATE PERIODS: In duration-specific value-
      pairs the amount of time represented must unambiguously be
      reducible to a number of seconds.  For example P2D is the
      equivalent of PT172800S (1 day = 86400 seconds.  For this reason
      RFC2445 has limited the possible members of this set to Weeks,
      Days, Hours, Minutes and Seconds, considering the ambiguity
      involved in the  length of a Year or a Month or century.



FitzPatrick, et al.      Expires April 25, 2003                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                   SkiCal                     October 2002


      At the same time the same members of the complete set; Centuries,
      Years, Months, Weeks, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds and fractions
      thereof, make convenient units for reoccurrences which are
      actually period-explicit.  For example; reoccurrences on the third
      of every month will give instances in time of unequal duration
      from each other.  In this memo the contents of the CYCLE attribue
      use the full ISO8601 set for reoccurrences.


4.1.1.1 Differences between ISO8601 and RFC2445

   Negative Periods of time: When representing PERIOD-EXPLICIT value-
   pairs,  RFC2445 always places the date-time value  first in the value
   pair.  Then the dur-value, by being positive (default, or preceded by
   a plus) or negative (preceded by a minus), determines whether the
   date-time value serves as the  start or end of the period.  ISO8601
   on the other hand signifies positive or negative durations by the
   ordering of values in the value pair.  If the dur-value precedes (is
   to the left of) the date-time value then the date-time value to the
   right is the end of the period.  If the dur-value is to the right of
   the date-time value then the date-time value serves as the start of
   the period.

   This memo uses the RFC2445 method for describing negative periods of
   time.

4.2 Term of the OPTIMESET

   Value Name: OPTERM

   Purpose: This value type is used to express an interval of time or a
   point in time.  The OPTERM value type when specified is used in

   computing the OPTIMESET.  This value type uses the date and date-time
   value definitions of RFC 2445 - 4.3.4 Date and 4.3.5 Date-Time as
   well as Julian Day, Modified Julian Date as standarized by the
   International Astronomical Union and the Network Time Protocol first
   described in RFC 868 and elaborated upon in RFC1305 .

   The opterm value-type is unique in the OPTIMESET insomuch as it is
   "anchored" or fixed to the common era.  No other OPTIMESET value-type
   shares this function.  Without the Opterm, other value-types can
   never point to a specific time or date - only infinite free floating
   reoccurrences such as every Monday.  On the other hand Opterms can
   not reoccur.

   OPTERM serve the purpose of anchoring and constraining the
   reoccurrences of it contents, but is also suitable for declaring
   single events or points in time.  In the later case the OPTERM will
   have no contents.

   The OPTERM value type is made up of two date-time values separated by
   one - alternatively two, SOLIDUS characters; "/" or "//" (US- ASCII
   decimal 47), or one date-time value separated by one or two SOLIDUS
   characters, from a text value; By the use of THISANDPRIOR the date-
   time value pair signifies an OPTERM period whose start time is either
   not relevant or unknown.  By the use of THISANDFUTURE the date-time
   value pair signifies an OPTERM whose conclusion is either not
   relevant or unknown.

   OVERLAPING VALUES: For all of the opentimeset members it is permited
   to have multiple intervals or points as the value of the range
   attribute, indicated by commas.  For ex: range=18880808/
   P500D,18890909/P5D.  When these values overlap such in the example
   above, no special consideration will be given to the overlapping
   date-times.  Above all they do not cancel out each other or turn a
   CLOSED into an OPEN or an OPEN into a CLOSED

   The OPTERM value includes an ID and an IDREF.  Through the ID, an
   OPTERM value can be used in another OPTIMESET.  Through the IDREF, an
   OPTERM declared in any other optimes set may be used.

   For example, the following OPTERM might be declared:

   OPTIMES:<OPTIMESET ID="Summer">
     <OPTERM ID="OPTERM3" range="19751214/THISANDFUTURE" state="OPEN">
       <OPSEASONS range="0515/0831" state="OPEN"/>
     </OPTERM>
   </OPTIMESET>


   and then referred to in another OPTIMES declaration.

       <OPSEASONS range="0901/1115" state="OPEN"/>

   An OPDAYS value may occur more than once in an OPTIMESET.    An
   OPDAYS property value  may include one or more comma-separated date-
   time value pairs for each day or interval of days.  Each WEEKDAY
   value can also be preceded by a positive (+n) or negative (-n)
   integer.  If present, this indicates the nth occurrence of the
   specific day within the MONTH.  For example, +1MO (or simply 1MO)
   represents the first Monday within the month, whereas -1MO represents
   the last Monday of the month.

5. SkiCal specific Calendar Component

   The body of an iCalendar object consists of a sequence of calendar
   properties and one or more calendar components.  The calendar
   properties are attributes that apply to the calendar as a whole.  The
   calendar components are collections of properties that express a
   particular calendar semantic.  For example, the calendar component
   can specify an event, a to-do, a journal entry, time zone
   information, or free/busy time information, or an alarm.

   A SkiCal extended iCalendar object may include a "VOPTIME" calendar
   component as defined by the following notation:





        component  =  (
                      / optimec
                      )



5.1 The OpTime calendar component

   Component Name: "OPTIME

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of component properties that describe the
   opening times of a SkiSource.

   Format Definition: An "OPTIME" calendar component is defined by the
   following notation:

        optimec     = "BEGIN" ":" "OPTIME" CRLF
                     optimeprop *alarmc
                     "END" ":" "OPTIME" CRLF

                   )

   Description: An "OPTIME" calendar component is a grouping of
   component properties, possibly including "VALARM" calendar
   components, that describes date-time values that we normally refer to
   as opening hours or business hours or operating hours.  The OPTIME
   component can be used to declare such times for any imaginable
   resource.  Generally, Opening Time schedules in any significant
   number are not ideal for visual representation in traditional PIM
   calendars, since if stored in an "opaque" manner they would "clutter
   up" the limited visual space available.  It is recommended that
   implementers develop alternative methods for visual representation of
   Optime calendar components.

   The "OPTIME" calendar component is identical to the "VEVENT" calendar
   component with the exception that the Date-time related properties

   such as DTSTART, DTEND and DURATION have been removed and replaced by
   the DTOPEN property.

   Example: The following is an example of the "VOPTIME" calendar
   component used to represent the business hours of a video rental
   store that is open daily from 10am to 10pm, except for Fridays and
   Saturdays, when open to 12pm :

6. SkiCal specific Component Properties

   The class of SkiCal objects is a superset of the class of iCalendar
   objects.  Therefore any component property, which MAY appear in a
   VEVENT iCalendar component, is also allowed in a SkiCal object.  In
   addition, the following component properties are defined in this
   memo.

      eventprop  =    /  *(

                          ; the following are optional,
                          ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                          publisher / skuid / whurl

                          ; the following are optional,
                          ; and MAY occur more than once

                          access / actions / bookings / control /
                          directions / optimes /namespace /
                          orientation / partrel / paymethod /
                          persons / placename / price /
                          prohibited / promo / recommended
                          required / skicalver / skilang
                          things / thinks / title

                         )

   It is RECOMMENDED that publishers chose the terms used as TEXT type
   property values from authoritative lists of terms.  Section 10

   For reasons of clarity the properties self-describing the SkiCal
   object are presented under the "MANAGEMENT" header (Calendar object
   management), while properties describing the actual SkiSource being
   described are presented under the interrogative headers; "WHAT",
   "WHEN", "WHERE", "WHO", "WHY", and "WHOW".  For example, the date
   when a SkiCal object describing a SkiSource was published would be
   defined by RFC2445 4.8.7.1 Date/Time Created, and this property would
   be sorted under MANAGEMENT while the date the actual SkiSource being
   described occurs is defined by RFC2445 4.8.2.4 Date/Time Start which
   would be sorted under WHEN.  The creator of a SkiCal object
   describing a SkiSource is defined by RFC2445 4.8.4.3 Organizer, and
   this property would be sorted under MANAGEMENT while the "organizer"
   or producer of the actual SkiSource being described could be defined
   by the one of the SkiCal properties such as Section 6.6.1 which would
   be sorted under WHO.

6.1 WHAT properties

   The following properties serve as place-holders for the answers to
   user questions about the SkiSource such as "What is it?" and "What is
   happening?".

   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] related to WHAT are:

      4.8.1.2 Categories

      4.8.1.5 Description - The description property in RFC2445 can be
      used to hold any sort of WHA information.

      4.8.1.11 Status

      4.8.1.12 Summary - The summary property in RFC2445 can be used to
      hold any sort of WHA information.

   In addition to the properties named above as defined in RFC-2445 [3],
   a SkiCal object may include the following properties

6.1.1 Title

   Property Name: TITLE

   Purpose: This property specifies the title or name of the SkiSource
   being described.

   Value Type: TEXT.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard and language property parameters
   can be specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: Public SkiSources often have titles .  The title may not
   be directly descriptive of the SkiSource.  The Title might be
   abstract in nature or it might be a copyrighted name that an owner
   wishes to see included in the calendar object.  The following example
   illustrates the difference between SUMMARY and TITLE: A photo
   exhibition by photographer Collier Schorr in New York City called
   "Excuse Me While I Kiss the Sky" can be described by these two lines
   in a SkiCal file:


   SUMMARY:Collier Schorr photos on exhibit in NYC
   TITLE:Excuse Me While I Kiss the Sky

                        (";" xparam)

                        )

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: This property allows for the publisher of a SkiSource to
   indicate a relation to another SkiSource.  This property differs from
   the RELATED-TO property of RFC-2445 [3], which defines a relationship
   between calendar objects describing SkiSources and not between
   SkiSources themselves.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

   Description: Language used at the SkiSource.  For example, the main
   language of a theatre play, the language spoken by the teacher of a
   course, or the languages spoken by the salespeople in a boutique.

   NOTE: If the SkiSource is being translated, the information about
   what languages are available as translations could be published under
   RESOURCES.

   NOTE: If knowledge of a certain language is required in order to
   appreciate the SkiSource, this should be indicated by a REQUIRED (or
   RECOMMENDED) property.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

      skilang            =   "SKILANG" skilangparam ":" language CRLF

      skilangparam       =    *(

                         ; the following is optional,

6.1.9 What URL

   Property Name: WHURL

   Purpose: This property defines a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
   associated with the SkiSource the SkiCal object is describing.

   Value Type: URI

Internet-Draft                   SkiCal                     October 2002


   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: This property may be used in a SkiCal object to convey a
   URL for information about the SkiSource.  The difference between
   WHURL and the iCal Property URL as defined in RFC2445 section 4.8.4.6
   is that while URL points to some place "where a more dynamic
   rendition of the calendar information associated with the calendar
   component can be found", WHURL points to the "home page" of the
   SkiSource itself.  This memo does not attempt to standardize the form
   of the URI, nor the format of the resource pointed to by the property
   value.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

      whurl         =   "WHURL" whurlparam ":" uri CRLF

      whurlparam    =   *(

                        ; the following is optional,

6.1.10 SkiSource Unique Identifier

   Property Name: SKUID

   Purpose: This property specifies a persistent, globally unique
   identifier for the SkiSource.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

Internet-Draft                   SkiCal                     October 2002


   Description: This property provides a method for determining a
   definite, authoritative and unique identification of a SkiSource.
   SKUID differs from the UID property defined in RFC2445 section
   4.8.4.7, whereas UID identifies a calendar component (SkiCal object),
   SKUID identifies the SkiSource being defined by the calendar
   component.

   The SKUID itself MUST be a globally unique identifier.  The generator
   of the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier is unique.
   There are several algorithms that can be used to accomplish this.
   The identifier is RECOMMENDED to be the identical syntax to the RFC-
   822 [7] addr-spec.  A good method to assure uniqueness is described
   in RFC-2445 [3], section 4.8.4.7 about Unique Identification Numbers.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

      skuid         =   "SKUID"  skuidparam ":" text CRLF


      skuidparam    =   *(

                       ; the following is optional,
                       ; but MUST NOT occur more than once
                       (";" languageparam ) / (";" nsrefparam )

                       ; the following is optional,
                       ; and MAY occur more than once

                       (";" xparam)
                       )

   Example: The following are examples of this property:

   SKUID:20021001T090045Z-4000F192713-0052@qwack.com
   SKUID;NSREF="TG":20021001T090045Z-4000F192713-0052@qwack.com

6.2 WHEN properties

   The following properties answer time and date related questions about
   the SkiSource, such as "When is it open" and "When does it happen?".

   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] related to WHEN are:

      4.8.2 Date and Time Component Properties

      4.8.3 Time Zone Component Properties

      4.8.5 Recurrence Component Properties

6.2.1 Date-time open

   Property Name: DTOPEN

   Purpose: This property can be used to specify reoccurring date-time
   schedules such as the opening -, operating -, accessible times of a
   SkiSource.  This Property is suitable for "persistent resources",
   that is resources that unlike events have  regular persistent
   operating hours.  Though in some cases a publisher could describe
   opening hours using the existing time-date properties and
   reoccurrence rules of RFC2445, those rules are not optimized  for
   this sort of use.   Further, a collection of such SkiSources, for
   example all the shops and restaurants in one's neighbourhood, would
   clutter a traditional PIM calendar, where events are expected to
   happen in a more or less serial fashion.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in a "VOPTIME" calendar
   component.

   Value Type: The default value type is TEXT.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard, value data type, time zone
   identifier property parameters can be specified on this property.

   Description: This property defines access information for a SkiSource
   - what are usually called the hours of business or operation.  The
   date time values are stated through the OPTIMESET of property Values
   and are referred to with the opref property parameter value.  The
   value of the Property is a text label describing what the  opening
   times derived through the OPTIMESET are referring to.  The OPTIMESET
   can be used to qualify several of the SkiCal properties.  If a
   SkiSource can be considered to have a "main", "primary" or
   "essential" Opening Times, then it is recommended that the DTOPEN
   property be used to declare these.

   There is a known discrepancy in RFC2445.  In section 4.6.1 Event
   Component, the ABNF declares that there are no obligatory properties
   in a VEVENT Component, while in 4.8.2.4 Date/Time Start it is stated
   that "The property is REQUIRED in "VEVENT" calendar components.  Even
   though the ABNF takes precedent over prose, until this discrepancy
   is resolved it is recommended that SkiCal publishers always include a
   DTSTART property in a SkiCal object.  If the publishers intention is
   to declare Opening Times and not the date-times of a specific event,
   it is recommended that they use the VOPTIME calendar component.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

                   )

   Example: The following are examples of this property:

   DTOPEN;opref="Bstandard":Balthazar's schedule

6.3 WHERE properties

   The following properties serve as place-holders for the answers to
   user questions about the SkiSource such as "Where does it happen?"
   and "Where do I find the SkiSource?".

   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] related to WHERE are:

      4.8.1.6 Geographic Position (GEO)

      4.8.1.7 Location

   SkiCal objects SHOULD use vCards [RFC 2426] as an ALTREP parameter
   value to the LOCATION property parameter, in order to provide machine
   readability and maintain information structure when exchanging data.
   For example, the alternate representation may specify either an LDAP
   URI pointing to an LDAP server entry or a CID URI pointing to a MIME
   body part containing a vCard for the location.

   In addition to the properties named above as defined in RFC-2445 [3],
   a SkiCal object may include the following properties.

6.3.1 Venue

   Property Name: VENUE

   Purpose: This property classifies the type of physical context in

   which an SkiSource takes place.

   Value Type: TEXT.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: The venue parameter divides SkiSources into a number of
   distinctly different groups, this is useful when there is a need to
   quickly reduce the number of SkiSources in a selection.  For example:
   When searching for outdoor sport SkiSources to take part in, it will
   help not having to browse through listings of TV shows showing
   sports.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

      venue        =    "VENUE" venueparam ":" venuetype CRLF

      venueparam   =    *(

                        ; the following is optional,
                        ; and MAY occur more than once

                        (";" xparam)
                        )

      venuetype      =   "Internet"      /
                         "Radio"         /
                         "TV"            /
                         "Outdoors"      /
                         "Indoors"       /
                         "Travel-transit"

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Example: The following are examples of this property:

           VENUE:Outdoors
           VENUE:TV

   Purpose: This property can be used to specify helpful directions for
   finding the SkiSource.

   Value Type: TEXT.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: Very often when a public SkiSource is published, there
   are instructions other than the address for finding the location.  In
   metropolitan areas this could be just the name of a subway stop,
   while on the sea it could possibly be a path defined by a series of
   GEO (longitude + latitude) coordinates that will help sailors avoid
   shallow water.

   TimeSpender questions about the SkiSource such as "Why should I
   attend?" and "Why would this be interesting?".

   WHY gathers promotional, instructive or informational material under
   one roof.  It is hoped that this will promote expedience.  Many
   applications will be operating in a narrow bandwidth environment;
   this is specially the case with mobile cellular phones, PDA's and
   other digiphernalia.

   well as the SkiSource publisher is given greater control over
   individual property access.

   There is no property defined in RFC-2445 [3] that is directly related
   to WHY.  Though iCal publishers could use the ATTACHMENT property to
   wrap promotional material or put promotional texts into DESCRIPTION.

6.5.1 Promotion

   Property Name: PROMO

   Purpose: This property allows for the organizer of the SkiSource to
   refer to advertising material, in various forms.

   Value Type: URI

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or

6.6 WHO properties

   The following property serves as place-holders for the answers to
   user questions about the SkiSource such as; Who is responsible? Who
   is the owner? Who authorized this? What organizations are involved?

   The property defined in RFC-2445 [3] related to WHO is:

   4.8.4.2 Contact

   It is RECOMMENDED that SkiCal objects use vCards [RFC 2426] as an
   ALTREP parameter value to the CONTACT property parameter, in order to
   provide machine readability and maintain information structure when
   exchanging data.  For example, the alternate representation may
   specify either an LDAP URI pointing to an LDAP server entry or a CID
   URI pointing to a MIME body part containing a vCard for the contact.

   In addition to the property named above as defined in RFC-2445 [3], a
   SkiCal object may include the following property;

6.6.1 Control

   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

6.7 MANAGEMENT properties

   The above SkiCal component properties all describe the SkiSource
   itself (description) and not, as is the case with many iCalendar
   component properties, the entry in a calendar user agent (CUA) or
   calendar server (CS) (self-description).

   It is possible that several, or even many calendar objects could
   refer to the same SkiSource.  Each of these calendar objects could
   have their own publisher, while the SkiSource itself has only one
   responsible authority.

   The properties defined in RFC-2445 [3] related to MANAGEMENT are:

      4.8.1.3 Classification

      4.8.1.4 Comment

      4.8.4.3 Organizer

      4.8.4.5 Related-to

      4.8.4.6 Uniform Resource Locator

      4.8.4.7 Unique Identifier

      4.8.7.1 Date/Time Created

      4.8.7.2 Date/Time Stamp

      4.8.7.3 Last Modified

      4.8.7.4 Sequence Number


6.7.1 Publisher

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: The ORGANIZER of a SkiSource is not always the one who
   makes the information about the SkiSource publicly available.  Many
   SkiCal objects will be published by organizations or private parties
   who are not an "ORGANIZER" as defined in RFC2445.  The role of the
   publisher is sometimes referred to as 'Infomediary'.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

      publisher       = "PUBLISHER" publisherparam ":" mailto CRLF

      publisherparam  =    *(

                     ; the following is optional,
                     ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                     (";" cnparam ) / (";" nsrefparam )  /
                     (";" skiroleparam)   / (";" altrepparam) /


                     ; the following is optional,
                     ; and MAY occur more than once

                     (";" xparam)

                     )

   Example: The following are examples of this property:

   PUBLISHER:mailto:info@timeout.co.uk

6.7.2 SkiCal Version

   Property Name:SKICALVER

   Property Name:SKICALVER

   Purpose: The inclusion of this property in an iCalendar object
   indicates the presence of SkiCal extensions.  At the same time this
   property specifies the identifier corresponding to the highest
   version number or the minimum and maximum range of the SkiCal
   specification that is required in order to interpret the SkiCal
   extensions.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.  This property MUST be specified by an
   iCalendar object containing any of the SkiCal extensions defined in
   this memo, but MAY only be specified once.

   Description: A value of "1.0" corresponds to this memo.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

        SkiCalver    = "SKICALVER" SkiCalverparam ":" vervalue CRLF

        SkiCalverparam   = *(";" xparam)

        vervalue   = "1.0"         ;This memo
                   / maxver
                   / (minver ";" maxver)

        minver     = <A IANA registered SkiCal version identifier>

        ; Minimum SkiCal version needed to parse the SkiCal extensions
        ; in the iCalendar object

        maxver     = <A IANA registered SkiCal version identifier>

        ; Maximum SkiCal version needed to parse the SkiCal extensions
        ; in the iCalendar object

   Example: The following is an example of this property:

        SKICALVER:1.0

6.7.3 Namespace

   Property Name: NAMESPACE

   Purpose: Designates a URL containing a list of values and assigns a
   prefix as a shorthand pointer to that URL.

   Value Type: URI

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or
   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: For many of the properties and property parameters of
   this note, it is recommended that text values be chosen from
   authoritative lists.  This property defines a method for the
   identification and location of such a list, but it does not define
   the syntax that such a list might employ.  The inclussion of a
   NAMESPACE properery in a calendar component does not imply that a
   SkiCal parser must be able to access such a list.

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

      namespace       =  "NAMESPACE" namespaceparam ":" uri CRLF

      namespaceparam  =  ";" "PREFIX" "=" prefix

      prefix          =  text

                         ; the following is optional,
                         ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

   Property Name: OPTIMES

   Purpose: Defines an OPTIMESET and assigns an id value for that set.

   Value Type: optimelist

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
   specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property CAN be specified within a "VEVENT" or

   "VOPTIME" calendar component.

   Description: .

   Format Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

      optimes       =  "OPTIMES" optimesparam ":" OPTIMESET CRLF

      optimesparam  =  ";" "ID" "=" text

   ; the OPTIMESET is defined as a value type in beginning of this memo

                         ; the following is optional,
                         ; and MAY occur more than once
                         (";" altrepparam) / (";"  itemparam ) /
                         (";" nsrefparam ) / (";" xparam)

                         )

   Example: The following is an example of this property:

   OPTIMES:<OPTIMESET ID="DEMO12"><OPTERM
    state="OPEN" range="20030225T15300Z/20030225T16300Z"/>
    </OPTIMESET>

   the OPTIMESET follows a uniform logical model.  The six value types
   can be thought of as containers of date-time values.  There is a
   hierarchal order for these containers, related to the significance of
   the date-time units running from centuries down to seconds.  This
   sort of ordering is  often referred to as the "Russian doll" model.

   OPTERM is the only container that can declare 4-digit year
   information in its range and it is at the top of the hierarchy.  An
   OPTERM value type can contain any of the other OPTIMESET value types,
   though not another OPTERM.  At the bottom of the hierarchy comes
   OPSECONDS, which can declare seconds and fractions of seconds as its
   range value, and can contain no other value-type.  This gives us six
   possible generations of containers; OPTERMS holding OPSEASONS holding
   OPDAYS holding OPHOURS holding OPMINUTES holding OPSECONDS.  But is
   possible to skip any or all but one of these.  So an OPTERM could
   contain an OPSECONDS container and nothing else or an OPMINUTES
   container could be the only member of an OPTIMESET.  When Parsing the
   OPTIMESET

   The following chart shows the possible contents for each OPTIMESET
   value type

    +------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |           OPSEASONS   OPDAYS   OPHOURS   OPMINUTES   OPSECONDS   |
    |                                                                  |
    |  OPTERM     YES        YES       YES        YES        YES       |
    |  OPSEASONS             YES       YES        YES        YES       |
    |  OPDAYS                          YES        YES        YES       |
    |  OPHOURS                                    YES        YES       |
    |  OPMINUTES                                             YES       |
    |  OPSECONDS  contain no other value-type                          |
    +------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Each container has a root date-time range setting the limits for all
   values inside that container.  For example an OPTERM container with a
   range of  20040101/20041231 can contain any number of lesser
   containers each with reoccurring datetime values, but an optimeset
   parser will only be concerned with date-times falling within the year
   2004.

   The OPTERM data value is unique insomuch as it is "anchored" to the
   era of the Gregorian Calendar, Julian Date system or Network Time
   Protocol.  It does not reoccur even though several OPTERM values may
   occur as siblings in an optimese).

   What sort of information does the OPTIMESET represent and how is it
   calculated?

   For each optimeset, individual containers at the bottom of the
   heirarchy are calculated first  and then all containers are matched
   against each other.  These calculations result in one period of time
   in which one (and only one) of three conditional states can be
   derived at at any given moment.  These three states are; TRUE, FALSE,
   and UNDETERMINED.

   In the OPTIMESET logical model all times are UNDETERMINED if not
   declared in an OPTIMESET.

   The reoccurrence rules for the OPTIMESET members are as follows.

   With the exception of OPTERM, the ranges of all OPTIMESET members
   will continue to reoccur indefinently unless constrained.

   The contents of a container are constrained by the range of that
   container.

   We tend to naturally schedule reoccurences in sync with  date-time

   units.  We choose for something to happen at the same time every day
   or the same day every week and so forth.  In this memo such
   reocurrences are refered to as "Date-time unit symetric".  They are
   the default reoccurence frequency of this memo.  They are as follows:


         A value type of seconds will reoccur every minute
                         Minutes                    hour
                         Hour                       day
                         weekday                    week
                         Monthday                   month
                         Yearday                    year
                         Season                     year

   But of course it is quite possible for things to reoccur with
   frequencies that do not naturally fall into the patterns above.  If
   for example a workshift was scheduled to be 6 days of work followd by
   4 days of rest, the resulting 10 day cycle would not be symetric with
   the seven day week date-time unit.  We call such reocurrences "Date-
   time unit asymetric" and such frequencies are enabled with the help
   of the CYCLE attribute.    Using CYCLE We can say for example that
   the reoccurrence range for a period of 0700/0900 hours is not days
   but rather a timespan of 22 hours - so when compared to a normal 24
   hour daily schedule the first occurence on the  the first day would
   be from  7-9 but on  the second day 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 on the third
   and so forth.  We can also use CYCLE to indicate date-time symetric
   ranges that are multiples of date-time units - such as a cycle of 7
   Years.

   Let us say that a OPSEASONS container held two OPDAYS containers
   without children.  With the container-logic atribute of the OPSEASONS
   an operator is chosen for combining the two OPDAYS containers.  The
   operators are AND, OR, XOR.  For example if the value of one opday
   was "TU,TH" and the other moday "05".

7. Security considerations

   Anybody could produce a SkiCal compliant file containing false
   information.  Calendar  publishers will need to exercise caution, or
   they may end up publishing invalid information.  Security can be
   achieved either by choosing to index SkiCal files only from trusted
   servers, or by employing a moderator who can correct or refuse
   corrupt information.  Nobody should consider information from non-
   encrypted SkiCal files 100% reliable, just as nobody SHOULD blindly
   trust printed advertisements or email.

   SkiSource organizers and publishers should be aware of legal
   implications from spreading personal information in electronic media.

8. Internationalisation and localisation

   The same Internationalization considerations apply as in all
   iCalendar applications.  See RFC-2445 section 2.3 [3].

9. Communication protocol

   The definitive method for interchanging SKiCal data between
   directories/calendars will probably be an extension to the Calendar
   Access Protocol CAP [4].  Since, as of this writing, CAP not yet
   published as an RFC, the process of extending it has not begun.
   Meanwhile, a simplistic approach is being used to synchronize
   existing SKICal databases over HTTP.

   Typically an organization wants to copy all SKICal data from certain
   SKICal databases.  In our simplistic solution we have two methods for
   this:

   1.  SKICal files are stored in a web accessible directory (which is
   basically a webpage with links to .ics files).  All files are fetched
   every time a synchronization needs to be made, they are parsed and
   all objects with a CREATED or LAST-MODIFIED value newer than the time
   of the previous synchronization are copied into the database.
   (Either automatically, or after review by an editor.)

   2.  A cgi program accepting one parameter, named 'since', returns a
   SKICal file containing all SKICal objects having a CREATED or LAST-
   MODIFIED value newer than local time 00:00:01 at the date indicated
   by the 'since' parameter.  The format of the 'since' parameter is
   YYYY-MM-DD.  (Eg.  2001-09-18 for September 18th 2001.)

   Obviously these methods are not economic, neither in terms of
   bandwidth usage or processing power.  The filtering of SKICal objects
   is left to the application since there is no way to limit your
   selection.  You might for example want to get all SKICal objects
   related to "sports".  Such selection mechanisms will appear in a
   later specification.

   In order to facilitate the creation of intelligent SKICal
   applications, though, it is RECOMMENDED that cgi export programs also
   implement the 'skuid' parameter.  A call (HTTP GET) to the cgi
   program with the 'skuid' value set should return a single SKICal
   object identified by that SKUID value, if there is such an object in
   the database.  A response other than a valid SKICal file from the cgi
   program should be interpreted as "no such object".

10. Choosing values from lists

   It is RECOMMENDED that text values be chosen from "authoritative
   naming lists" whenever possible.  Doing this, the publisher will
   increase the level of machine readability and thus increase the
   accumulated global value of all iCalendar/SkiCal objects.  It is
   expected that such lists will become widely available and accessible
   online, possibly in the RDF [11] or XML-Schema format.
