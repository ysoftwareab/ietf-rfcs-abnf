                Multiple SIP Reason Header Field Values
                draft-sparks-sipcore-multiple-reasons-00

Abstract

   The SIP Reason Header Field as defined in RFC 3326 allows only one
   Reason value per protocol value.  Practice shows it is useful to
   allow multiple values with the same protocol value.  This update to
   RFC 3326 allows multiple values for an indicated registered protocol
   when that protocol defines what the presence of multiple values
   means.

1.  Introduction

   The SIP Reason Header Field as defined in RFC 3326 allows only one
   Reason value per protocol value.  Practice shows it is useful to
   allow multiple values with the same protocol value.  This update to
   RFC 3326 allows multiple values for an indicated registered protocol
   when that protocol defines what the presence of multiple values
   means.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Update to RFC3326

   The last paragraph of section 2 of [RFC3326] is replaced as follows:

   A SIP message MAY contain more than one Reason value (i.e., multiple
   Reason lines), but all of them MUST have different protocol values
   (e.g., one SIP and another Q.850).  An implementation is free to
   ignore Reason values that it does not understand.

   NEW:

   A SIP message MAY contain more than one Reason value (i.e., multiple
   Reason lines).  If the registered protocol for the Reason value
   specifies what it means for multiple values to occur in one message,
   more than one value for that protocol MAY be present.  Otherwise,
   there MUST be only one value per protocol provided (e.g., one SIP and
   another Q.850).  An implementation is free to ignore Reason values
   that it does not understand.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document adds no security considerations to the use of SIP.  The
   security considerations in [RFC3326] and those in any registered
   protocols used in Reason header field values should be considered.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
