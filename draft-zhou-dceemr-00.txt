     DCEEMR: A Delay-constrained Energy Efficient Multicast Routing 
                Algorithm in Cognitive Radio ad hoc Networks

Abstract 
                   
   In this paper, we discuss the delay-constrained energy efficient 
   multicast routing problem in cognitive radio ad hoc networks. A 
   cognitive radio ad hoc network is a wireless multi-hop network 
   established by secondary users on varying available spectrum bands. 
   The routing research is a hotspot in the field of cognitive radio 
   ad hoc networks. However, multicast routing algorithm study of 
   cognitive radio ad hoc networks is still in starting stage. In this 
   paper, we proposed a novel delay-constrained energy efficient 
   multicast routing algorithm (DCEEMR) in cognitive radio ad hoc 
   networks. The DCEEMR guarantees that the multicast tree can be found 
   if it exists, and the multicast tree satisfies the delay bound and 
   has low energy consuming. The algorithm uses delay-energy function 
   to construct the multicast tree based on the spectrum selection. 
   Through an example with randomly network topology, we demonstrate 
   that our algorithm is better in terms of energy cost of multicast 
   tree as compared to the existing algorithm QoS Dependent Multicast 
   Routing (QDMR). Moreover, the algorithm does not suffer from high 
   complexity common to the algorithm QDMR. Experiment results by NS-2 
   show that the delay and tree cost are lower than well-known 
   Multicast ad- hoc On-demand Distance Vector (MAODV) protocol.

2. Introduction 
    
   Recent technological advances have resulted in the development of 
   wireless ad hoc networks composed of devices that are self-organizing
   and can be deployed without infrastructure support. These devices 
   generally have small form factors, and have embedded storage, 
   processing and communication ability [1]. With the growing 
   proliferation of wireless devices, these bands are increasingly 
   getting congested.
   
   The licensing of the wireless spectrum is currently undertaken on 
   a long-term basis over vast geographical regions. In order to 
   address the critical problem of spectrum scarcity, the FCC has 
   recently approved the use of unlicensed devices in licensed bands. 
   Consequently, dynamic spectrum access techniques are proposed to 
   solve these current spectrum inefficiency problems. This new area
   of research foresees the development of cognitive radio networks 
   to further improve spectrum efficiency. The basic idea of cognitive
   radio networks is that the unlicensed devices (also called cognitive
   radio users or secondary users) need to vacate the band once the 
   licensed device (also known as a primary user) is detected. The 
   emerging field of cognitive radio networks is geared to address the
   increasing congestion in the unlicensed band by opportunistically 
   using vacant spectrum, such as, frequencies licensed for television 
   broadcast, public service, among others [2]. Cognitive radios are 
   highly agile wireless platforms capable of autonomously choosing 
   device parameters based on prevailing operating conditions [3]. 
   Cognitive radio networks, however, impose unique challenges due to 
   the high fluctuation in the available spectrum as well as diverse 
   quality of service (QoS) requirements [4]. 
   
   Cognitive radio ad hoc networks can be defined as follows [5]: 
   Cognitive radio ad hoc network is considered for realizing the 
   cognitive radio by using multi-hop communication networks without 
   giving the large interference toward the primary system. In [1], 
   the authors give the differences between Cognitive radio ad hoc 
   networks and classical ad hoc networks: 
   
   (1) Choice of transmission spectrum: In Cognitive radio ad hoc 
   networks, the available spectrum bands are distributed over a wide 
   frequency range, which vary over time and space. Thus, each user 
   shows different spectrum availability according to the primary user
   activity. As opposed to this, classical ad hoc networks generally 
   operate on a pre-decided channel that remains unchanged with time. 
   For the ad hoc networks with multi-channel support, all channels are
   continuously available for transmission, though nodes may select few
   of the latter from this set based on self-interference constraints. 
   A key distinguishing factor is the primary consideration of 
   protecting the primary user transmission, which is entirely missing 
   in classical ad hoc networks.

Internet-Draft     Link State Update Mechanism            August  2010  
  
   
   (2) Topology control: In classical ad hoc networks, this is easily 
   accomplished by periodic beacon messages on the channel. However, 
   in Cognitive radio ad hoc networks, as the licensed spectrum 
   opportunity exists over large range of frequencies, sending beacons 
   over all the possible channels is not feasible. Thus, cognitive 
   radio ad hoc networks are highly probable to have incomplete 
   topology information, which leads in an increase in collisions among
   cognitive radio users as well as interference to the primary users.
   
   (3) Multi-hop/multi-spectrum transmission: The end-to-end route in 
   the cognitive radio ad hoc networks consists of multiple hops having
   different channels according to the spectrum availability. Thus, 
   cognitive radio ad hoc networks require collaboration between 
   routing and spectrum allocation in establishing these routes. 
   Moreover, the spectrum switches on the links are frequent based on 
   primary user arrivals. As opposed to classical ad hoc networks, 
   maintaining end-to-end QoS involves.
   
   (4) Distinguishing mobility from primary user activity: In classical
   ad hoc networks, routes formed over multiple hops may periodically
   experience disconnections caused by node mobility. These cases may 
   be detected when the next hop node in the path does not reply to 
   messages and the retry limit is exceeded at the link layer. However,
   in Cognitive radio ad hoc networks, a node may not be able to 
   transmit immediately if it detects the presence of a primary user on
   the spectrum, even in the absence of mobility. Thus, correctly 
   inferring mobility condition and initiating the appropriate recovery
   mechanism in cognitive radio ad hoc networks necessitate a different
   approach from the classical ad hoc networks.
   
   Based on the above, the existing routing algorithms and routing 
   protocols in classical ad hoc networks are not suitable for 
   cognitive radio ad hoc networks and are unaware of the changing 
   spectrum opportunity. In cognitive radio ad hoc networks, routes 
   must be constructed to avoid the regions affected by active primary 
   users and must also adapt themselves to subsequent changes induced 
   by new primary user arrivals. We discuss the delay-constrained 
   energy efficient multicast routing algorithm based on this principle.
   
   The most significant challenges in cognitive radio ad hoc network 
   routing are to maximize secondary users' throughput and minimize 
   their consumed energy, while not interfering with the primary users.
   Energy efficiency is a critical issue in cognitive radio ad hoc 
   network routing algorithms due to lack of infrastructure supporting.
   Furthermore increasing real-time applications are required to be 
   satisfied QoS constraints, such as delay, jitter, data packets 
   lossing, etc. For the sake of guarantee the behalf of primary user,
   such application requires consideration of spectrum selection and 
   spectrum switching.

Internet-Draft     Link State Update Mechanism            August  2010


   In the paper, we address the problem of multicast routing in 
   cognitive radio ad hoc networks, and first propose the delay-bounded
   energy efficient multicast routing algorithm in cognitive radio ad 
   hoc networks. Multicast is communication from a single source node 
   to a group of multicast. A fundamental issue in multicast 
   communication is route selection, usually based on trees. So our 
   multicast routing algorithm makes great efforts to find a multicast
   tree, which is rooted from the source and spans all multicast nodes
   and have lowest energy cost of tree. In cognitive radio ad hoc 
   networks, nodes communicate with each other by radio signals, which
   are broadcast in nature. The algorithm uses the local cost 
   information, which makes it can be easily actualized in a 
   distributed manner.
   
   Routing algorithm is a hotspot issue in the field of cognitive 
   network. In cognitive radio ad hoc networks, its routing research 
   requires consideration of selection spectrum and routing path [6,7].
   However, numerous works focused multicast routing on classical 
   wireless ad hoc networks [8]. Though there are some routing 
   protocols on supporting spectrum decision in cognitive radio 
   networks [9,10], most of the existing works focuses on unicast 
   routing. As far as multicast routing algorithm in cognitive radio 
   ad hoc networks, the research is still in starting stage. 
   
   In a classical ad hoc network, each node has a limited energy 
   resource (battery), and operates in an unattended manner. 
   Consequently, energy efficiency is an important design consideration
   for these networks. Most recent work [11-15] has been proposed for 
   the problems of minimizing the energy consumption for multicasting 
   in classical wireless ad hoc networks, addressed as Minimum-Energy 
   Multicast (MEM) [6,11], respectively. Since the MEM problem have 
   recently been shown to be NP-hard [16,17].They proved the energy 
   efficient multicast routing problem is unlikely has an approximation
   algorithm with a constant performance ratio of the number of nodes
   in the networks. Efficient heuristic algorithm design has received 
   much more attention. Deying Li et al [6] proposed a steiner tree 
   based algorithm with a guaranteed approximation performance ratio
   and two efficient heuristic algorithms for the energy efficient 
   multicast problem in ad hoc networks. And they first prove the 
   problem is NP-hard.
   
   For the MEM problem, a straight greedy approach is the use of 
   multicast trees that consist of the best unicast paths to each 
   individual destination from the source node. In [11], Multicast 
   Incremental Power (MIP) method is based on a broadcast tree 
   construction algorithm with pruning the redundant branches of the 
   broadcast tree to obtain a multicast tree in wireless networks. For
   supporting real-time applications, there have been many 
   delay-constrained multicast routing algorithms [12-14]. In [12], 
   Kou, Markowsky and Berman proposed a heuristic algorithm KMB with 
   named the abbreviation of their names for the steiner tree problem. 
   In [13], Kompella, Pasquale and Polyzos designed an algorithm named 
   KPP (the abbreviation of the authors), the algorithm extends KMB 
   algorithm to construct delay-constrained multicast tree.

   KPP algorithm assumes that the delay bound and link delays are all 
   integers. Guo and Matta proposed QDMR algorithm in [14], which 
   modified Destination-Driven Multicast Routing (DDMC) algorithm, 
   where DDMC is an unconstrained Steiner tree heuristic algorithm[15].
   QDMR dynamic adjusts its indicator function according to ratio 
   between end-to-end delay (from source node to multicast node) and 
   the delay bound. But the two algorithms are not designed for 
   cognitive radio ad hoc network. Cheng G.and Liu W. et al [9] 
   proposed the method to evaluate cumulative delay in cognitive radio
   ad hoc network. In their protocol, the cumulative delay was regarded
   as routing metric, which was based on ad-hoc on-demand distance 
   vector (AODV) [18]. 
   
   Our multicast routing algorithm arises from the observation that 
   DDMC algorithm to give priority to multicast nodes and QDMR 
   algorithm to choose the new adding node with lower end-to-end delay
   in constructing multicast tree as soon as possible. But it is quite 
   different from these algorithms: at first, our multicast routing 
   algorithm adapts to cognitive radio ad hoc network environment 
   based on spectrum selection mechanism. The algorithm can construct
   an energy efficient multicast tree with satisfying the delay bound. 
   Spectrum selection is based on our energy-delay function. Secondly, 
   our algorithm considers the average cost consuming of candidate node
   covering multicast node in constructing multicast tree, so it is 
   more efficient than existing algorithms. We detail our algorithm in 
   Section 3. In the numerical results, we demonstrate that our 
   algorithm is better in terms of energy cost as compared to the 
   existing algorithm QDMP through an example. Experiment results by 
   NS-2 show that the delay and energy cost are lower than well-known 
   MAODV protocol [19].
   
   In the remainder of this paper, in Section 2, we give the network 
   model and the problem definition. We detail our algorithm DCEEMR in
   Section 3. In Section 4, we present the simulation results. We give
   some conclusion in Section 5.
 
                   
3. Network Model and Problem Specification
                   
   A cognitive radio ad hoc network can be modeled as a directed graph G
   which has two variants V and E.The V is the union set of Vc and Vp,
   which represents total network nodes. Vc represents cognitive nodes 
   (secondary users), Vp represents primary nodes (primary users). E is 
   the set of links representing logical connectivity between all 
   cognitive nodes. There is no link among primary nodes and between 
   primary nodes and cognitive nodes. If a link exists between cognitive
   nodes vi and vj, that means vi and vj can connect directly while not
   interfering with any primary node. We assume that vi belongs to Vc 
   which is a cognitive node and Ni is the set of neighbor nodes of vi. 
   Let prec(vi) be the predecessor node of vi and e(vi,vj) is the 
   energy cost of link (vi,vj). In this paper, we will construct an 
   energy efficient multicast tree T, where T belonging to G is a 
   sub-network of the cognitive ad hoc network. Our aim to find a 
   multicast tree T so that the sum of energy cost e(vi,vj),i and j 
   belong to T in multicast tree T is lower as soon as possible.

   In addition, based on spectrum availability and node mobility of 
   cognitive radio ad hoc networks, end-to-end delay should be 
   considered during the process of designing algorithm. We assume 
   that there are K channels in link(vi,vj) and d(vi,vj) is the delay 
   of link(vi,vj) from node vi to vj through channel k which belongs 
   to K.and b is the delay bound, where vi and vj belong to Vc. In 
   cognitive radio ad hoc networks, the end-to-end delay not only 
   denotes path latency from source node to a multicast node, but also 
   includes the time of switching channel owing to the factor of 
   primary user activity. Here, let P(s,vi) denote a path (or routing) 
   from source node s to vi. Similar to [2] and [9], we assume that the
   channel switching time ts is fixed at vm that belongs to P(s,vi) and
   path latency tp is delay sum of all links from source node to 
   multicast node vi belonging to M. If there is not primary user 
   activity in a routing, then we have ts=0. In our algorithm, we will
   optimize the two objectives: energy consumption and end-to-end 
   delay. But the energy efficient is considered first, i.e., if we 
   find newly adding node which satisfy energy efficient, then we check
   that whether the network satisfy delay requirement. We will describe
   concretely our problem as follows.
   
   Given a multicast request (s,M), where s is a source node and M is a
   set of multicast nodes, let T be a multicast tree rooted at source 
   node s. Leaf nodes in T only receive message, do not need to 
   transmit them. We assume receiving messages do not consume any 
   energy, that means only transmitting message could incur energy 
   cost. Let Ct(e) be the energy cost of the links in T. We assume that
   D(vi) is the sum of ts and tp and is the end-to-end delay of the 
   path from source node s to the multicast node vi and b is a delay 
   bound which means that the maximum tolerance of network if 
   end-to-end delay less than b. For every nodevi that belongs to M, 
   the delay bound from s to vi must be satisfied. That means: the 
   minimum value of the sum of Ct(e),and D(vi) less than b,vi 
   belonging to M.
   
   If setting the delay bound to be infinity, the delay-constrained 
   MEM problem simplifies to the unconstrained MEM problem in cognitive
   radio ad hoc network. Cognitive nodes in cognitive radio ad hoc 
   network can be regarded as the nodes in classical ad hoc network 
   without consideration to the interfering with primary users, and the
   problem can be seen as the special case of unconstrained MEM 
   problem, which has been proved to be NP-hard. Our problem is how to,
   given a multicast request (s,M) and energy cost Ct(e) for each link 
   e, find a multicast tree rooted at s and spanning all nodes in M 
   such that total energy cost is minimized. In this paper, we present
   a heuristic algorithm to resolve this problem.

4. DCEEMR algorithm 

   In this section, we shall describe the algorithm in three parts: 
   (1) the spectrum selection in multicast tree and the (2) algorithm 
   description, and at last (3) we give an example of DCEEMR algorithm.
   Through an example, we demonstrate that our algorithm is better in 
   terms of energy cost of multicast tree as compared to the existing 
   algorithm QDMR.
                   
4.1 Spectrum selection in multicast tree
              
   In cognitive radio ad hoc networks, routing algorithm not only 
   considers path selection but also faces spectrum decisions. Many 
   routing protocols of cognitive radio ad hoc networks are based on 
   basically routing protocols of classical ad hoc networks, e.g., the 
   routing selecting in [20] and [9] is based on unicast routing 
   protocol AODV and in [2] is based on geographic routing protocol 
   greedy perimeter stateless routing (GPSR) [21]. The best routing 
   paths are fist identified and then the preferred spectrums among 
   the path are chosen in [3], here, the AODV routing protocol is 
   modified to include the list of preferred spectrums by a given node 
   as the route request (RREQ) is forwarded. Once the RREQ is received,
   the destination is aware of spectrums that may be used to transmit 
   at each hop and finds the optimal combination such that channel 
   switching is minimized. These routing protocols are not applicable 
   in delay-constrained energy efficient multicast routing problem, 
   because it can not guarantee the delay from source node to multicast
   nodes all satisfy the delay bound. But our spectrum selection 
   mechanism is similar to these spectrum opportunities (SOP) 
   methods [9]. Intuitively, a channel can be considered as an 
   opportunity if it is not currently used by primary users [22]. 
   Consider a pair of secondary users (AandB) aiming to communicate in 
   the presence of primary users. A channel is an opportunity to A and
   B if they can communicate successfully over this channel while 
   limiting the interference to primary users below a prescribed level 
   determined by the regulatory policy. A common control channel is 
   then formed by those traditional interfaces, such that all 
   nodes' SOP can be shared among network. The key message is that SOP 
   must be defined jointly at the transmitter and the receiver. It is 
   a function of (1) the transmission powers of both primary and 
   secondary nodes, (2) the geographical locations of these nodes, 
   and (3) the interference constraint. From this definition, we arrive
   at the following properties of spectrum opportunity.    
   
   P1. Spectrum opportunity depends on both transmitting and receiving 
   activities of primary users.
   P2. Spectrum opportunity is, in general, asymmetric: a channel that 
   is an opportunity when A is the transmitter and B the receiver may 
   not be an opportunity when B is the transmitter and A the receiver.

   In [9] and [21], end-to-end delay consists of channel switching time
   and path latency which is delay sum of all links from source node 
   to multicast node vi from M. Based on that D(vi) is the sum of ts 
   and tp, we can get the end-to-end delay from the source node to the 
   nodes in multicast tree T. Similar with [2] and [9], we select 
   appropriate spectrum based on the delay for every nodes. Thus our 
   work focus on selecting appropriate nodes as tree nodes to 
   construct a delay-bounded energy efficient multicast tree, we 
   consider spectrum decision based on the delay in multicast tree in 
   cognitive radio ad hoc network.

   At first, a RREQ packet with piggyback (SOP s) information which 
   is available spectrum band is transmitted by the source node on 
   each channel that is not affected by the primary user activity. For 
   example, in figure 1, the RREQ packet carries (SOP s) of node 
   transmit to node H, node I and node J. If SOP information of 
   receiving nodes exist intersection with sending node, this means 
   that receiving node can use same spectrum with sending node and 
   does not interfere with nearby primary node, then the receiving 
   node adds its own SOP information to the packet then forward the 
   message.
              
   (1) Handling RREQ packet: After receiving RREQ packet, as forwarding
   nodes, node H and node I add their own SOP information to the packet
   and then forward the different RREQ packet (bring their (SOP s, H) 
   and (SOP s, I) information respectively) to their next hop nodes if
   their SOP information exist intersection with (SOP s), and 
   otherwise drop RREQ . But as destination nodes, nodes J, K , F and 
   G chooses available spectrum band from intersection of (SOP s) and 
   then encapsulate spectrum choice into route reply (RREP) and sent 
   back to predecessor node or source node.
   
   (2)Handling RREP packet: After receiving RREP packet, as forwarding
   nodes, node H and I assign an appropriate spectrum band to the next
   hop or source node respectively based on our delay-energy function
   in DCEEMR algorithm, which will be described concretely in next 
   subsection. But as source node S , it starts data packet transfer.
   
4.2 Formulas in DCEEMR algorithm

   Given a multicast request (s,M), we first define three sets. 
   Firstly, let V(T) be the set of nodes in multicast tree T, including
   only source node at the beginning of constructing the tree. We aim 
   to find the delay bounded efficient energy multicast tree including 
   all multicast nodes in V(T). Let NT be the set of neighbor nodes of 
   the multicast tree T, i.e., it contains the neighbor nodes of 
   candidate nodes. Meanwhile, let U be the set of the uncovered 
   multicast nodes. An uncovered multicast node means a node belongs 
   to neither V(T) nor NT. We assume that vi from Vc is a cognitive 
   node and Ni is the set of neighbor nodes of vi.Let prec(vi) be the 
   predecessor node of vi and e(vi,vj) is the cost of link(vi,vj).

   This heuristic grows the multicast tree from s. At the beginning, 
   V(T) only contains source node s, NT contains the neighbor nodes of 
   s, and U contains all multicast node s. After running the algorithm 
   to end, U becomes null, that means V(T) contains all multicast 
   nodes. For selecting appropriate forwarding nodes to minimize the 
   total cost in formula (1) and to satisfy the delay-bound b, we 
   define a delay-energy function to evaluate each candidate node vi 
   from NT.           
   
   The function can be described as follows.First we define a function
   f(vi).We get a result of b minus D(vj),then we get a sum of the 
   results of each vj from Ni.We make it the denominator,and the 
   intersection of Ni and U the numerator.We define this function as X.
   The second,we get a sum of e(vi,vj) of evey value from Nj.We use 
   this result to multiply X,then plus e(prec(vi),vj) makes f(vi).The 
   last, we use D(vi) to multiply e(prec(vi),vj) as numerator and the 
   b as the denominator.So we get g(vi).
   
   Wheree (prec(vi),vj) denote link cost the between of tree node 
   prec(vi) and the candidate node vi, and the result of sum of 
   e(vi,vj) divided by the intersection of Ni and U denotes the average
   energy cost of the candidate node vi from NT covering a multicast 
   node. The X denotes the average residual delay from the source node
   to a multicast node covered by the candidate node vi, where D(vi) 
   is the end-to-end delay from the source node to the multicast node 
   vj. The nodes with lower energy cost and delay are chosen to add to 
   the tree in our algorithm.
   
   If the candidate node vi subject to the intersection of Ni and U 
   that is null, choose the node with lower f(vi) to add to the tree. 
   If he candidate nodevi from NT subject to intersection of Ni and U 
   that is null, we use the function mentioned above to evaluate every 
   candidate node.
   
   Now, we discuss our energy-delay function. In KPP algorithm, the 
   choice function only adds the cost link which ensures the ratio of 
   the cost between two multicast nodes and residual delay in completed
   graph to be lowest. But it does not fit for cognitive radio ad hoc 
   network. Instead, we first calculate the average cost of the 
   candidate node covering multicast nodes, and then use the sum of 
   the average cost and the communication cost between the candidate 
   node and its father node as numerator. This sum value is more fair 
   and proper to the delay-constrained energy efficient multicast 
   routing problem in cognitive network. While the value of f(vi) is 
   lower, the cost consuming of candidate node covering multicast node
   is more efficient, and at the same time, the end-to-end delay is 
   less than delay bound b.
   
   In DDMC algorithm, the algorithm gives priority to multicast nodes.
   The cost of a new node v via a node u to add to the multicast tree 
   is Cost(v). We use I(u) to multiply Cost(u) then make the result 
   plus c(u,v) to get Cost(v).Where the indicator function I(u) is 
   defined as follows: If u belongs to M, I(u) is 0,otherwise, I(u) 
   is 1.

   Where M is the set of multicast nodes. If node u is a multicast 
   node, the cost of the new node v is only the cost of the link from 
   node u to v. It made the path to a new node via a multicast node is 
   more likely to add to the tree. This information is used to give 
   "preference" to multicast nodes. But the constructed tree is easy 
   to have some very long branches like a chain of multicast nodes, 
   which lead some multicast nodes violate delay bound. Guo and Matta
   proposed QDMR algorithm in [14], which modified DDMC algorithm. 
   It modified the indicator function, let it can adjust according to
   how far a multicast node is from the delay bound. The indicator 
   function is: If u belongs to M, we make Delay(u) divided by b to 
   get I(u).Otherwise , I(u) is 1.
   
   Where Delay(u) is the delay sum of all links from source node to
   multicast node u and b is the delay bound. If the delay of the 
   source node to a multicast node is closer to delay bound, the 
   multicast nodes is given less priority to be a parent node of the 
   newly added node.
   
   In our algorithm, the formula above is based on the indicator 
   function of QDMR algorithm. But our D(vi) and e(prec(vi),vj) is 
   quite different with QDMR as mentioned.D(vi) is the end-to-end 
   delay from the source node to node vi which is the neighbor node 
   of the tree. In QDMR algorithm, Delay(u) in its indicator function 
   means the delay from the source node to the multicast node u in 
   tree. And the cost of a newly added node v need add the cost of the 
   node which it via in the tree. Our algorithm does not need to give 
   priority to multicast nodes, and the cost of a new node v is not 
   related with the parent tree node in the algorithm. Instead, we 
   evaluate the cost of a new node by its delay and the energy cost 
   between the tree and it.
   
   When select the next hop node, if the intersection of Ni and U isn't
   null, choose the node with lower f(vi) to add to the tree. If nodes 
   has same f(vi) or the intersection of Ni and U is null (that means 
   the set of neighbor nodes of candidate nodes has no any multicast 
   node), choose the node with g(vi) lower to add to the tree.
   
4.3 Algorithm Implements

   Input: network graph G, a source node s, the set of multicast nodes 
   M;
   
   Output: a delay-bounded energy efficient multicast tree T.
   
   Step 1. Initialization: let V(T) equals s , U equals M, NT equals
   Ns.
   
   Step 2. Based on the spectrum section mechanism in section 3.1, 
   source node s and candidate nodes select available spectrums to 
   neighbor nodes of NT.
   
   Step 3. If U isn't null,

   If exists vi from NT, subject to the intersection of Ni and U that 
   is not null, select an appropriate vi from NT  to minimize f(vi) 
   in formula above.
   
   If has no node vi from NT, subject to the intersection of Ni and U 
   that is not null, select a appropriate vi from NT to minimize g(vi)
   in formula above.
   
   When choose the node to add to the tree, let V(T) a union set of 
   V(T), vi and the intersection of Ni and U,U equals M minus the 
   intersection of M and Ni, and update NT.
   
   Step 4.  If U isn't null,  the algorithm stops. 
   Otherwise go to step 2.

5. Security Considerations 
                   
   The presence of the Reason header in a response does not affect the
   treatment of the response.

   Including such a header by an untrusted entity could adulterate the
   reactions of the originating entities.  E.G. sending back a cause
   value "87" can cause an announcement within the PSTN/ISDN saying that
   the call was rejected due to the Closed User Group service.

   Therefore it is RECOMMENDED to include the Reason header information
   in Responses only by trusted entities as it is described within
   [RFC3325][7].
