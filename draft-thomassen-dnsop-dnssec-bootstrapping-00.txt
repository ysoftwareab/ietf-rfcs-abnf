Abstract

   This document describes an authenticated in-band method for automatic
   signaling of a DNS zone's delegation signer information from the
   zone's DNS operator.  The zone's registrar or registry may
   subsequently use this signal for automatic DS record provisioning in
   the parent zone.

1.  Introduction

   *TODO remove*: this section is inspired by [RFC7344], Section 1.

   The first time a DNS Operator signs a zone, they need to communicate
   the keying material to the Parent.  Depending on the desires of the
   Parent, the Child might send their DNSKEY record, a DS record, or
   both.

   So far, out-of-band methods are typically used to complete the chain
   of trust.  In-band methods exist, in particular based on the CDS and
   CDNSKEY record types as specified in [RFC7344] and [RFC8078].
   However, such communication is only authenticated when performing a
   rollover of the Child's keys represented in the parent.  An
   authenticated in-band channel for enabling DNSSEC so far has been
   missing.

   How the keying material is conveyed to the Parent during initial
   DNSSEC bootstrapping depends on the relationship the Child has with
   the Parent.  In many cases this is a manual process -- and not an
   easy one.  The communication has to occur between the DNS Operator
   and, depending on the circumstances, the Registry or the Registrar,
   possibly via the Registrant (for details, see [RFC7344], Appendix A).
   Any manual process is susceptible to mistakes and/or errors.  In
   addition, due to the annoyance factor of the process, Operators may
   avoid the process of getting a DS record set published at the Parent.

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                 June 2021


   DNSSEC provides data integrity to information published in DNS; thus,
   DNS publication can be used to automate maintenance of delegation
   information.  This document describes a method to automate
   publication of inital DS records for a hitherto insecure delegation.

   Readers are expected to be familiar with DNSSEC, including [RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC6781], [RFC7344], and [RFC8078].

   This document describes a method for automated provisioning of the
   delegation trust information and proposes a polled/periodic trigger
   for simplicity.  Some users may prefer a different trigger.  These
   alternate additional triggers are not discussed in this document.

1.1.  Terminology

   The terminology we use is defined in this section.  The highlighted
   roles are as follows:

   Child  The entity on record that has the delegation of the domain
      from the Parent.

   Parent  The domain in which the Child is registered.

   Child DNS Operator  The entity that maintains and publishes the zone
      information for the Child DNS.

   Parental Agent  The entity that the Child has a relationship with to
      change its delegation information.

   Bootstrapping Domain  Given an authoritative nameserver hostname from
      the Child's NS record set, that hostname prefixed the label
      "_boot".

   Signaling Name  A Bootstrapping Domain prefixed with a label encoding
      the Child's name.

   CDS/CDNSKEY  This notation refers to CDS and/or CDNSKEY, i.e., one or
      both.

   Base32hex Encoding  "Base 32 Encoding with Extended Hex Alphabet" as
      per [RFC4648].

1.2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Description

   When setting up initial trust, the child generally wants to enable
   global validation.  As long as the child is insecure, DNS answers can
   be forged.  The goal is to promote the child from insecure to secure
   as soon as reasonably possible by the parent.  This means that the
   period from the child's publication of CDS/CDNSKEY RRset to the
   parent publishing the synchronized DS RRset should be as short as
   possible.

   This goal is achieved by transferring trust from the Child DNS
   Operator.

2.1.  Preconditions

   In order to use this technique, the following conditions have to be
   met:

   1.  The Child DNS Operator SHOULD publish CDS/CDNSKEY records at the
       Child's apex, as described in [RFC7344].

   2.  Each Bootstrapping Domain MUST be part of a securely delegated
       zone, i.e. has a valid DNSSEC chain of trust from the root.

   3.  The Child DNS Operator MUST be able to maintain and publish DNS
       information in these zone (i.e. under the Bootstrapping Domains).

   For operational or other reasons, a Bootstrapping Domain MAY coincide
   with a zone cut.

2.1.1.  Example

   When performing DNSSEC bootstrapping for the Child zone "example.com"
   using NS records "ns1.example.net" and "ns2.example.net", the Child
   DNS Operator

   1.  should publish CDS/CDNSKEY records at "example.com";

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                 June 2021


   2.  needs to ensure that a valid DNSSEC chain of trust exists for the
       zone(s) that are authoritative for the Bootstrapping Domains
       "_boot.ns1.example.net" and "_boot.ns2.example.net";

   3.  must be able to maintain and publish DNS information in these
       zones.

2.1.2.  Zone Cut Clarification

   A Bootstrapping Domain such as "_boot.ns1.example.net" may be a zone
   of its own, in which case it needs to be secure and under the control
   of the Child DNS Operator.  If the Bootstrapping Domain does not
   coincide with a zone cut, these conditions are instead imposed on the
   containing zone (such as "example.net").

   The "Bootstrapping Domain" terminology is necessary to describe the
   bootstrapping mechanism without regard to whether there is a zone cut
   at these names or not.

2.2.  Bootstrapping Method

2.2.1.  Steps Taken by the Child DNS Operator

   To perform DNSSEC bootstrapping for the Child zone, the Child DNS
   Operator MUST (re-)publish the Child's CDS/CDNSKEY records at the
   corresponding Signaling Name under each Bootstrapping Domain (see
   example below).  These records belong to the autoritative zone of the
   Bootstrapping Domain, and as such they MUST be signed with that
   zone's keys, and MUST NOT be signed with the Child zone's keys.

   The Signaling Name contains a label identifying the Child's name.
   This label MUST be equal to the SHA-256 hash digest of the Child's
   name in "Base 32 Encoding with Extended Hex Alphabet", as specified
   in [RFC4648].  Trailing padding characters ("=") MUST be dropped.

   Previous uses of CDS/CDNSKEY records are specified at the apex only
   ([RFC7344], Section 4.1).  This protocol extends the use of these
   record types on non-apex owner names for the purpose of DNSSEC
   bootstrapping.  To avoid the possibility of semantic collision, there
   MUST NOT be a zone cut at a Signaling Name.

   *TODO Remove Note 1:* The purpose of the hash function is to avoid
   the possibility of exceeding the maximum length of a DNS name.  This
   could occur if the Child name was used as is.

   *TODO Remove Note 2:* The encoding choice is like in NSEC3, except
   that SHA-256 is used instead of SHA-1.  This is to prevent other
   tenants in shared hosting environments from creating collisions.

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                 June 2021


2.2.1.1.  Example

   To bootstrap the Child zone "example.com" using NS records
   "ns1.example.net" and "ns2.example.net", the Bootstrapping Domains
   are "_boot.ns1.example.net" and "_boot.ns2.example.net".  The Child
   DNS Operator thus (re-)publishes the Child's CDS/CDNSKEY records
   under the names

kdsqdtnelusqanhnhg8o0d72ekf6gbtbjsmj1aojq895b1me353g._boot.ns1.example.net
kdsqdtnelusqanhnhg8o0d72ekf6gbtbjsmj1aojq895b1me353g._boot.ns2.example.net

   where "kdsqdtnelusqanhnhg8o0d72ekf6gbtbjsmj1aojq895b1me353g" is the
   unpadded Base32hex Encoding of "example.com".  The records are
   accompanied by RRSIG records created using the key(s) of the zone
   which is authoritative for the respective Bootstrapping Domain.

   *TODO remove:* Should hash input include trailing dot?  (Command was:
   "echo -n example.com | openssl dgst -binary -sha256 | base32hex | tr
   -d =")

2.2.2.  Steps Taken by the Parental Agent

   When the Parental Agent receives a new NS record set (or additionally
   at any other time considered appropriate), the Parental Agent,
   knowing both the Child zone name and its NS hostnames,

   1.  MUST query the CDS/CDNSKEY records located at each of the
       Signaling Names (using standard DNS resolution);

   2.  MUST perform DNSSEC validation of all responses retrieved in Step
       1;

   3.  SHOULD query the CDS/CDNSKEY records located at the Child zone
       apex, directly from each of the authoritative nameservers as
       given in the Child NS record set;

   4.  MUST checks that all CDS/CDNSKEY record sets retrieved in Steps 1
       and 3 have equal record contents;

   5.  SHOULD derive a DS record set from the retrieved CDS/CDNSKEY
       record sets and publish it in the Parent zone, as to secure the
       Child's delegation.

   If an error condition occurs during Steps 1--4, in particular:

   *  DNS resolution failure during retrieval of CDS/CDNSKEY records
      from any Signaling Name (Step 1), or failure of DNSSEC validation
      (Step 2),

Internet-Draft            dnssec-bootstrapping                 June 2021


   *  Failure to retrieve CDS/CDNSKEY records located at the Child apex
      from all of the Child's authoritative nameservers (Step 3),

   *  Inconsistent responses (Step 4),

   the Parental Agent MUST NOT proceed to Step 5.

2.2.2.1.  Example

   To bootstrap the Child zone "example.com" using NS records
   "ns1.example.net" and "ns2.example.net", the Parental Agent

   1.  queries CDS/CDNSKEY records, using standard DNS resolution, for
       the names

kdsqdtnelusqanhnhg8o0d72ekf6gbtbjsmj1aojq895b1me353g._boot.ns1.example.net
kdsqdtnelusqanhnhg8o0d72ekf6gbtbjsmj1aojq895b1me353g._boot.ns2.example.net

   2.  performs DNSSEC validation of the responses retrieved in Step 1;

   3.  queries CDS/CDNSKEY records for "example.com" directly from
       "ns1.example.net" and "ns2.example.net";

   4.  checks that CDS record sets retrieved in Step 1 agree across
       responses and also with the CDS record sets retrieved in Step 3;
       ditto for CDNSKEY;

   5.  publishes a DS record set according to the information retrieved
       in the previous steps.

2.2.2.2.  Opt-out

   As a special case of Step 4 failure, the Child MAY opt out from
   DNSSEC bootstrapping by publishing a CDS/CDNSKEY record with
   algorithm 0 and other fields as specified in [RFC8078], Section 4, at
   its apex.  (This opt-out mechanism is without regard to whether the
   Child DNS Operator signs the zones and publishes records at the
   Signaling Names.)

3.  Implementation Status

   *Note to the RFC Editor*: please remove this entire section before
   publication.

   *  PowerDNS supports manual creation of CDS/CDNSKEY records on non-
      apex names.

   *  TODO Proof of concept

4.  Security Considerations

   Thoughts (to be expanded):

   *  We use at least one established chain of trust (via the secure
      delegations of the zones containing the NS hostnames).  As a
      result,

      -  communication is authenticated;

      -  process is immediate (no need for observing CDS/CDNSKEY records
         via TCP for several days);

      -  an active on-wire attacker cannot tamper with the delegation.

   *  When validating against CDS/CDNSKEY records at the Child's apex,
      the security level of the method is strictly higher than the
      "accept CDS/CDNSKEY after a while"-approch that is already in use
      at several ccTLD registries ("Accept after Delay", [RFC8078],
      Section 3.3).  This is because the method described here adds
      stronger guarantees, but removes nothing.  Perhaps this means that
      co-publication of CDS/CDNSKEY at the Child apex should be
      mandatory.  (This in turn may interact somehow with the Child's
      opt-out option.)

   *  Actors in the chain(s) of trust of the zone(s) used for
      bootstrapping (the DNS Operator themselves, plus entities further
      up in the chain) can undermine the protocol.  However,

      -  that's also possible in the case of CDS/CDNSKEY (see previous
         point);

      -  if the Child DNS Operator doesn't control the zones in which
         its NS hostnames live (including their nameservers' A records)
         because the path from the root is untrusted, you probably don't
         want to trust that operator as a whole;

      -  when bootstrapping is done upon receipt of a new NS record set,
         the window of opportunity is very small (and easily monitored
         by the Child DNS operator);

      -  mitigation exists by diversifying e.g. the nameserver
         hostname's TLDs, which is advisable anyways.

5.  IANA Considerations

   *TODO:* reserve "_boot"?
