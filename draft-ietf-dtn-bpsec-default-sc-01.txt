Abstract

   This document defines default integrity and confidentiality security
   contexts that may be used with the Bundle Protocol Security Protocol
   (BPSec) implementations.  These security contexts may be used for
   both testing the interoperability of BPSec implementations and for
   providing basic security operations when no other security contexts
   are defined or otherwise required for a network.

Internet-Draft       BPSec Default Security Contexts       February 2021


1.  Introduction

   The Bundle Protocol Security Protocol (BPSec) [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec]
   specification provides inter-bundle integrity and confidentiality
   operations for networks deploying the Bundle Protocol (BP)
   [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis].  BPSec defines BP extension blocks to carry
   security information produced under the auspices of some security
   context.

   This document defines two security contexts (one for an integrity
   service and one for a confidentiality service) for populating BPSec
   Block Integrity Blocks (BIBs) and Block Confidentiality Blocks
   (BCBs).

   These contexts generate information that MUST be encoded using the
   CBOR specification documented in [RFC8949].

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Integrity Security Context BIB-HMAC-SHA2

3.1.  Overview

   The BIB-HMAC-SHA2 security context provides a keyed hash over a set
   of plain text information.  This context uses the Secure Hash
   Algorithm 2 (SHA-2) discussed in [RFC4634] combined with the HMAC
   keyed hash discussed in [RFC2104].

   BIB-HMAC-SHA2 supports three variants of HMAC-SHA, based on the
   supported length of the SHA-2 hash value.  These variants correspond
   to HMAC256-SHA256, HMAC384-SHA384, and HMAC512-SHA512 as defined in
   [RFC8152] Table 7: HMAC Algorithm Values.  The selection of which
   variant is used by this context is provided as a security context
   parameter.

   The output of the HMAC shall be equal to the size of the SHA2 hashing
   function: 256 bits for SHA-256, 384 bits for SHA-384, and 512 bits
   for SHA-512.

   The BIB-HMAC-SHA2 security context shall have the Security Context ID
   specified in Section 5.1.

3.2.  Scope

   The scope of BIB-HMAC-SHA2 refers to the set of information used to
   produce the plain text over which a keyed hash is calculated.  This
   plain text is termed the "Integrity Protected Plain Text" (IPPT).
   The contents of the IPPT is constructed as the concatenation of
   information whose integrity is being preserved from the BIB-HMAC-SHA2
   security source to its security acceptor.  There are four types of
   information that can be used in the generation of the IPPT, based on
   how broadly the concept of integrity is being applied.  These four
   types of information, whether they are required, and why they are
   important for integrity, are discussed as follows.

   Security target contents
       The contents of the block-type-specific data field of the
       security target MUST be included in the IPPT.  Including this
       information protects the security target data and is considered
       the minimal, required set of information for an integrity service
       on the security target.

   Primary block
       The primary block identifies a bundle and, once created, the
       contents of this block are immutable.  Changes to the primary
       block associated with the security target indicate that the
       security target (and BIB) may no longer be in the correct bundle.

       For example, if a security target and associated BIB are copied
       from one bundle to another bundle, the BIB may still contain a
       verifiable signature for the security target unless information
       associated with the bundle primary block is included in the keyed
       hash carried by the BIB.

       Including this information in the IPPT protects the integrity of
       the association of the security target with a specific bundle.

   Security target other fields
       The other fields of the security target include block
       identification and processing information.  Changing this
       information changes how the security target is treated by nodes
       in the network even when the "user data" of the security target
       are otherwise unchanged.

       For example, if the block processing control flags of a security
       target are different at a security verifier than they were
       originally set at the security source then the policy for
       handling the security target has been modified.

Internet-Draft       BPSec Default Security Contexts       February 2021


       Including this information in the IPPT protects the integrity of
       the policy and identification of the security target data.

   BIB other fields
       The other fields of the BIB carrying the security result for this
       security context security block include block identification and
       processing information.  Changing this information changes how
       the BIB is treated by nodes in the network, even when other
       aspects of the BIB are unchanged.

       For example, if the block processing control flags of the BIB are
       different at a security verifier than they were originally set at
       the security source, then the policy for handling the BIB has
       been modified.

       Including this information in the IPPT protects the integrity of
       the policy and identification of the security service in the
       bundle.

       NOTE: The security context identifier and security context
       parameters of the security block are not included in the IPPT
       because these parameters, by definition, are required to verify
       or accept the security service.  Successful verification at
       security verifiers and security acceptors implies that these
       parameters were unchanged since being specified at the security
       source.

   The scope of the BIB-HMAC-SHA2 security context is configured using
   an optional security context parameter.

3.3.  Parameters

   BIB-HMAC-SHA2 can be parameterized to select SHA-2 variants,
   communicate key information, and define the scope of the IPPT.

3.3.1.  SHA Variant

   This optional parameter identifies which variant of the SHA-2
   algorithm is to be used in the generation of the authentication code.

   This value MUST be encoded as a CBOR unsigned integer.

   Valid values for this parameter are as follows.

   +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   When not provided, implementations SHOULD assume a value of 6
   (indicating use of HMAC384/SHA384), unless an alternate default is
   established by security policy at the security source, verifier, or
   acceptor of this integrity service.

3.3.2.  Encapsulated Key

   This optional parameter contains the output of a Key Encapsulation
   Mechanism (KEM) run at the security source of this security context.

   This value MUST be encoded as a CBOR byte string.

   If provided, this information is used to retrieve the symmetric HMAC
   key used in the generation of security results for this security
   context.  If not provided, security verifiers and acceptors MUST
   determine the proper key as a function of their local BPSec policy
   and configuration, as discussed in Section 3.5.

3.3.3.  Integrity Scope Flags

   This optional parameter contains a series of flags that describe what
   information is to be included with the block-type-specific data when
   constructing the IPPT value.

   This value MUST be represented as a CBOR unsigned integer, the value
   of which MUST be processed as a bit field containing no more than 16
   bits.

   Bits in this field represent additional information to be included
   when generating an integrity signature over the security target.
   These bits are defined as follows.

      - Bit 0 (the low-order bit, 0x1): Primary Block Flag.

      - Bit 1 (0x02): Target Header Flag.

      - Bit 2 (0x03): Security Header Flag.

      - Bits 3-7 are reserved.

      - Bits 8-15 are unassigned.

3.5.  Key Considerations

   BIB-HMAC-SHA2 does not define or otherwise mandate any method for key
   exchange, encryption, or encapsulation.  The derivation of an
   appropriate key for use in the integrity service is considered




Birrane                  Expires August 19, 2021                [Page 7]

   separate from the application of the integrity service for this
   context.

   HMAC keys used with this context MUST be symmetric and MUST have a
   key length equal to the output of the HMAC.

   It is assumed that any security verifier or security acceptor
   performing an integrity verification can determine the proper HMAC
   key to be used.  Potential sources of the HMAC key include (but are
   not limited to) the following:

      Pre-placed keys selected based on local policy.

      Keys extracted from encapsulated key material carried in the BIB.

      Session keys negotiated via a mechanism external to the BIB.

   NOTE: When keys are extracted from key material carried in the BIB
   itself, the encapsulated key SHOULD be protected by an approved
   algorithm such as NIST SP-800-38F.  The determination to use approved
   algorithms increases interoperability and can be specified as part of
   local security policy.

   BIB-HMAC-SHA2 provides no explicit requirements on the configuration,
   storage, or exchange of HMAC keys.

3.6.  Canonicalization Algorithms

   This section defines the canonicalization algorithm used to prepare
   the IPPT input to the BIB-HMAC-SHA2 integrity mechanism.  The
   construction of the IPPT depends on the settings of the Integrity
   Scope Flags that may be provided as part of customizing the behavior
   of this security context.

   In all cases, the canonical form of any portion of an extension block
   MUST be performed as described in [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec].  The
   canonicalization algorithms defined in [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec] adhere to
   the canonical forms for extension blocks defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis] but resolve ambiguities related to how values
   are represented in CBOR.

   The IPPT is constructed using the following process.

   1.  The canonical form of the IPPT starts as the empty set with
       length 0.

Internet-Draft       BPSec Default Security Contexts       February 2021


   2.  If the Integrity Scope parameter is present and the Primary Block
       Flag is set to 1, then a canonical form of the bundle's primary
       block MUST be calculated and the result appended to the IPPT.

   3.  If the Integrity Scope parameter is present and the Security
       Header flag is set to 1, then the canonical form of the Block
       Type Code, Block Number, and Block Processing Control Flags
       associated with the BIB MUST be calculated and, in that order,
       appended to the IPPT.

   4.  If the Integrity Scope parameter is present and the Target Header
       flag is set to 1, then the canonical form of the Block Type Code,
       Block Number, and Block Processing Control Flags associated with
       the security target MUST be calculated and, in that order,
       appended to the IPPT.

   5.  The canonical form of the security target block-type-specific
       data MUST be calculated and appended to the IPPT.

3.7.  Processing

3.7.1.  Keyed Hash Generation

   During keyed hash generation, two inputs are prepared for the the
   appropriate HMAC/SHA2 algorithm: the HMAC key and the IPPT.  These
   data items MUST be generated as follows.

      The HMAC key MUST have the appropriate length as required by local
      security policy.  The key may be generated specifically for this
      integrity service, given as part of local security policy, or
      through some other key management mechanism as discussed in
      Section 3.5.

      Prior to the generation of the IPPT, if a CRC value is present for
      the target block of the BIB, then that CRC value MUST be removed
      from the target block.  This involves both removing the CRC value
      from the target block and setting the CRC Type field of the target
      block to "no CRC is present."

      Once CRC information is removed, the IPPT MUST be generated as
      discussed in Section 3.6.

   Upon successful hash generation the following actions MUST occur.

      The keyed hash produced by the HMAC/SHA2 variant MUST be added as
      a security result for the BIB representing the security operation
      on this security target, as discussed in Section 3.4).

Internet-Draft       BPSec Default Security Contexts       February 2021


   Finally, the BIB containing information about this security operation
   MUST be updated as follows.  These operations may occur in any order.

      The security context ID for the BIB MUST be set to the context
      identifier for BIB-HMAC-SHA2.

      Any local flags used to generate the IPPT SHOULD be placed in the
      Integrity Scope flags security parameter for the BIB unless these
      flags are expected to be correctly configured at security
      verifiers and acceptors in the network.

      The HMAC key MAY be encapsulated using some key encapsulation
      mechanism (to include encrypting with a key encryption key) and
      the results of the encapsulation added as the Encapsulated Key
      security parameter for the BIB.

      The SHA Variant used by this security context SHOULD be added as
      the SHA Variant security parameter for the BIB if it differs from
      the default key length.  Otherwise, this parameter MAY be omitted
      if doing so provides a useful reduction in message sizes.

   Problems encountered in the keyed hash generation MUST be processed
   in accordance with local BPSec security policy.

3.7.2.  Keyed Hash Verification

   During keyed hash verification, the input of the security target and
   a HMAC key are provided to the appropriate HMAC/SHA2 algorithm.

   During keyed hash verification, two inputs are prepared for the the
   appropriate HMAC/SHA2 algorithm: the HMAC key and the IPPT.  These
   data items MUST be generated as follows.

      The HMAC key MUST be derived using the Encapsulated Key security
      parameter if such a parameter is included in the security context
      parameters of the BIB.  Otherwise, this key MUST be derived in
      accordance with security policy at the verifying node as discussed
      in Section 3.5.

      The IPPT MUST be generated as discussed in Section 3.6 with the
      value of Integrity Scope flags being taken from the Integrity
      Scope flags security context parameter.  If the Integrity Scope
      flags parameter is not included in the security context parameters
      then these flags MAY be derived from local security policy.

   The calculated HMAC output MUST be compared to the expected HMAC
   output encoded in the security results of the BIB for the security
   target.  If the calculated HMAC and expected HMAC are identical, the

   verification MUST be considered a success.  Otherwise, the
   verification MUST be considered a failure.

   If the verification fails or if any needed parameters are missing
   then the verification MUST be treated as failed and processed in
   accordance with local security policy.

   This security service is removed from the bundle at the security
   acceptor as required by the BPSec specification.  If the security
   acceptor is not the bundle destination and if no other integrity
   service is being applied to the target block, then a CRC MUST be
   included for the target block.  The CRC type, as determined by
   policy, is set in the target block's CRC type field and the
   corresponding CRC value is added as the CRC field for that block.

4.  Security Context BCB-AES-GCM

4.1.  Overview

   The BCB-AES-GCM security context replaces the block-type-specific
   data field of its security target with cipher text generated using
   the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher operating in Galois/
   Counter Mode (GCM) [AES-GCM].

   Additionally, the BCB-AES-GCM security context generates an
   authentication tag based on the plain text value of the block-type-
   specific data and other additional authenticated data that may be
   specified via parameters to this security context.

   This security context supports two variants of AES-GCM, based on the
   supported length of the symmetric key.  These variants correspond to
   A128GCM and A256GCM as defined in [RFC8152] Table 9: Algorithm Value
   for AES-GCM.

   The BCB-AES-GCM security context shall have the Security Context ID
   specified in Section 5.1.

4.2.  Scope

   There are two scopes associated with BCB-AES-GCM: the scope of the
   confidentiality service and the scope of the authentication service.
   The first defines the set of information provided to the AES-GCM
   cipher for the purpose of producing cipher text.  The second defines
   the set of information used to generate an authentication tag.

   The scope of the confidentiality service defines the set of
   information provided to the AES-GCM cipher for the purpose of
   producing cipher text.  This MUST be the full set of plain text



Birrane                  Expires August 19, 2021               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft       BPSec Default Security Contexts       February 2021


   contained in the block-type-specific data field of the security
   target.

   The scope of the authentication service defines the set of
   information used to generate an authentication tag carried with the
   security block.  This information MUST include the plain text of the
   block-type-specific data field of the security target.  This
   information MAY include other information (additional authenticated
   data), as follows.

   Primary block
       The primary block identifies a bundle and, once created, the
       contents of this block are immutable.  Changes to the primary
       block associated with the security target indicate that the
       security target (and BCB) may no longer be in the correct bundle.

       For example, if a security target and associated BCB are copied
       from one bundle to another bundle, the BCB may still be able to
       decrypt the security target even though these blocks were never
       intended to exist in the copied-to bundle.

       Including this information as part of additional authenticated
       data ensures that security target (and security block) appear in
       the same bundle at the time of decryption as at the time of
       encryption.

   Security target other fields
       The other fields of the security target include block
       identification and processing information.  Changing this
       information changes how the security target is treated by nodes
       in the network even when the "user data" of the security target
       are otherwise unchanged.

       For example, if the block processing control flags of a security
       target are different at a security verifier than they were
       originally set at the security source then the policy for
       handling the security target has been modified.

       Including this information as part of additional authenticated
       data ensures that the cipher text in the security target will not
       be used with a different set of block policy than originally set
       at the time of encryption.

   BCB other fields
       The other fields of the BCB include block identification and
       processing information.  Changing this information changes how
       the BCB is treated by nodes in the network, even when other
       aspects of the BCB are unchanged.

Internet-Draft       BPSec Default Security Contexts       February 2021


       For example, if the block processing control flags of the BCB are
       different at a security acceptor than they were originally set at
       the security source then the policy for handling the BCB has been
       modified.

       Including this information as part of additional authenticated
       data ensures that the policy and identification of the security
       service in the bundle has not changed.

       NOTE: The security context identifier and security context
       parameters of the security block are not included as additional
       authenticated data because these parameters, by definition, are
       those needed to verify or accept the security service.
       Therefore, it is expected that changes to these values would
       result in failures at security verifiers and security acceptors.

   The scope of the BCB-AES-GCM security context is configured using an
   optional security context parameter.

4.3.  Parameters

   BCB-AES-GCM can be parameterized to specify the AES variant,
   initialization vector, key information, and identify additional
   authenticated data.

4.3.1.  Initialization Vector (IV)

   This optional parameter identifies the initialization vector (IV)
   used to initialize the AES-GCM cipher.

   The length of the initialization vector, prior to any CBOR encoding,
   MUST be between 8-16 bytes.  A value of 12 bytes SHOULD be used
   unless local security policy requires a different length.

   This value MUST be encoded as a CBOR byte string.

   The initialization vector may have any value with the caveat that a
   value MUST NOT be re-used for multiple encryptions using the same
   encryption key.  This value MAY be re-used when encrypting with
   different keys.  For example, if each encryption operation using BCB-
   AES-GCM uses a newly generated key, then the same IV may be reused.

4.3.2.  AES Variant

   This optional parameter identifies the AES variant being used for the
   AES-GCM encryption, where the variant is identified by the length of
   key used.

Internet-Draft       BPSec Default Security Contexts       February 2021


   This value MUST be encoded as a CBOR unsigned integer.

   Valid values for this parameter are as follows.

                       AES Variant Parameter Values

   +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
   | Value |                        Description                        |
   +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
   |   1   | A128GCM as defined in [RFC8152] Table 9: Algorithm Values |
   |       |                        for AES-GCM                        |
   |   3   | A256GCM as defined in [RFC8152] Table 9: Algorithm Values |
   |       |                        for AES-GCM                        |
   +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

   When not provided, implementations SHOULD assume a value of 3
   (indicating use of A256GCM), unless an alternate default is
   established by security policy at the security source, verifier, or
   acceptor of this integrity service.

   Regardless of the variant, the generated authentication tag MUST
   always be 128 bits.

4.3.3.  Encapsulated Key

   This optional parameter contains the output of a Key Encapsulation
   Mechanism (KEM) run at the security source of this security context.

   This value MUST be encoded as a CBOR byte string.

   If provided, this information is used to retrieve the symmetric AES
   key used in the generation of security results for this security
   context.  If not provided, security verifiers and acceptors MUST
   determine the proper key as a function of their local BPSec policy
   and configuration, as discussed in Section 4.5.

4.3.4.  AAD Scope Flags

   This optional parameter contains a series of flags that describe what
   information is to be included with the block-type-specific data of
   the security target as part of additional authenticated data (AAD).

   This value MUST be represented as a CBOR unsigned integer, the value
   of which MUST be processed as a bit field containing no more than 16
   bits.

   Bits in this field represent additional information to be included
   when generating an integrity signature over the security target.
   These bits are defined as follows.

      - Bit 0 (the low-order bit, 0x1): Primary Block Flag.

      - Bit 1 (0x02): Target Header Flag.

      - Bit 2 (0x03): Security Header Flag.

      - Bits 3-7 are reserved.

      - Bits 8-15 are unassigned.

4.3.5.  Enumerations

   BCB-AES-GCM defines the following security context parameters.

                      BCB-AES-GCM Security Parameters

    +----+-----------------------+--------------------+---------------+
    | Id |          Name         | CBOR Encoding Type | Default Value |

    | 4  |    AAD Scope Flags    |        UINT        |      0x7      |
    +----+-----------------------+--------------------+---------------+

                                  Table 4

4.4.  Results

   The BCB-AES-GCM security context produces a single security result
   carried in the security block: the authentication tag.

   NOTES:

      The cipher text generated by the cipher suite is not considered a
      security result as it is stored in the block-type-specific data
      field of the security target block.  When operating in GCM mode,
      AES produces cipher text of the same size as its plain text and,
      therefore, no additional logic is required to handle padding or
      overflow caused by the encryption in most cases (see below).

      If the generated cipher text contains the authentication tag and
      the tag can be separated from the cipher text then the tag MUST be

Internet-Draft       BPSec Default Security Contexts       February 2021


      separated and stored in the Authentication Tag security result
      field.

      If the generated cipher text contains the authentication tag and
      the tag cannot be separated from the cipher text then the tag MUST
      NOT be included in the Authentication tag security result field.
      Instead the security target block MUST be resized to accommodate
      the additional 128 bits of authentication tag included in the
      generated cipher text.

4.4.1.  Authentication Tag

   The authentication tag is generated by the cipher suite over the
   security target plain text input to the cipher suite as combined with
   any optional additional authenticated data.  This tag is used to
   ensure that the plain text (and important information associated with
   the plain text) is authenticated prior to decryption.

   If the authentication tag is included in the cipher text placed in
   the security target block-type-specific data field, then this
   security result MUST NOT be included in the BCB for that security
   target.

   The length of the authentication tag, prior to any CBOR encoding,
   MUST be 128 bits.

   This value MUST be encoded as a CBOR byte string.

4.4.2.  Enumerations

   BCB-AES-GCM defines the following security context parameters.

                       BCB-AES-GCM Security Results

          +-----------+--------------------+--------------------+
          | Result Id |    Result Name     | CBOR Encoding Type |
          +-----------+--------------------+--------------------+
          |     1     | Authentication Tag |    Byte String     |
          +-----------+--------------------+--------------------+

                                  Table 5

4.5.  Key Considerations

   BCB-AES-GCM does not define or otherwise mandate any method for key
   exchange, encryption, or encapsulation.  The derivation of an
   appropriate key is considered separate from the application of the
   authenticated confidentiality service provided by this context.

   Keys used with this context MUST be symmetric and MUST have a key
   length equal to the key length defined in the security context
   parameters or as defined by local security policy at security
   verifiers and acceptors.

   It is assumed that any security verifier or security acceptor can
   determine the proper key to be used.  Potential sources of the key
   include (but are not limited to) the following.

      Pre-placed keys selected based on local policy.

      Keys extracted from encapsulated key material carried in the BCB.

      Session keys negotiated via a mechanism external to the BCB.

   NOTE: When keys are extracted from key material carried in the BCB
   itself, the encapsulated key SHOULD be protected by an approved
   algorithm such as NIST SP-800-38F.  The determination to use approved
   algorithms increases interoperability and can be specified as part of
   local security policy.

   BCB-AES-GCM provides no explicit requirements on the configuration,
   storage, or exchange of keys.

4.6.  Canonicalization Algorithms

   This section defines the canonicalization algorithms used to prepare
   the inputs used to generate both the cipher text and the
   authentication tag.

   In all cases, the canonical form of any portion of an extension block
   MUST be performed as described in [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec].  The
   canonicalization algorithms defined in [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec] adhere to
   the canonical forms for extension blocks defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpbis] but resolve ambiguities related to how values
   are represented in CBOR.

4.6.1.  Cipher text related calculations

   The plain text used during encryption MUST be calculated as the
   single, definite-length CBOR byte string representing the block-type-
   specific data field of the security target excluding the CBOR byte
   string identifying byte and optional CBOR byte string length field.

   For example, consider the following two CBOR byte strings and the
   plain text that would be extracted from them.

   +------------------------------+---------+--------------------------+

                                  Table 6

   Similarly, the cipher text used during decryption MUST be calculated
   as the single, definite-length CBOR byte string representing the
   block-type-specific data field excluding the CBOR byte string
   identifying byte and optional CBOR byte string length field.

   All other fields of the security target (such as the block type code,
   block number, block processing control flags, or any CRC information)
   MUST NOT be considered as part of encryption or decryption.

4.6.2.  Additional Authenticated Data

   The construction of additional authenticated data depends on the AAD
   Scope flags that may be provided as part of customizing the behavior
   of this security context.

   The canonical form of the AAD input to the BCB-AES-GCM mechanism is
   constructed using the following process.  This process MUST be
   followed when generating AAD for either encryption or decryption.

   1.  The canonical form of the AAD starts as the empty set with length
       0.

   2.  If the AAD Scope parameter is present and the Primary Block Flag
       is set to 1, then a canonical form of the bundle's primary block
       MUST be calculated and the result appended to the AAD.

   3.  If the AAD Scope parameter is present and the Security Header
       flag is set to 1, then the canonical form of the Block Type Code,
       Block Number, and Block Processing Control Flags associated with
       the BIB MUST be calculated and, in that order, appended to the
       AAD.

   4.  If the AAD Scope parameter is present and the Target Header flag
       is set to 1, then the canonical form of the Block Type Code,



Birrane                  Expires August 19, 2021               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft       BPSec Default Security Contexts       February 2021


       Block Number, and Block Processing Control Flags associated with
       the security target MUST be calculated and, in that order,
       appended to the AAD.

   If, after this process, the AAD remains at length 0, then no AAD
   exists to be input to the cipher suite.

4.7.  Processing

4.7.1.  Encryption

   During encryption, four inputs are prepared for input to the AES/GCM
   cipher: the encryption key, the Initialization Vector (IV), the
   security target plain text to be encrypted, and any additional
   authenticated data.  These data items MUST be generated as follows.

   Prior to encryption, if a CRC value is present for the target block,
   then that CRC value MUST be removed.  This requires removing the CRC
   field from the target block and setting the CRC Type field of the
   target block to "no CRC is present."

      The encryption key MUST have the appropriate length as required by
      local security policy.  The key may be generated specifically for
      this encryption, given as part of local security policy, or
      through some other key management mechanism as discussed in
      Section 4.5.

      The Initialization Vector (IV) selected MUST be of the appropriate
      length.  Because replaying an IV in counter mode voids the
      confidentiality of all messages encrypted with said IV, this
      context also requires a unique IV for every encryption performed
      with the same key.  This means the same key and IV combination
      MUST NOT be used more than once.

      The security target plain text for encryption MUST be generated as
      discussed in Section 4.6.1.

      Additional authenticated data, if present, MUST be generated as
      discussed in Section 4.6.2 with the value of AAD Scope flags being
      taken from local security policy.

   Upon successful encryption the following actions MUST occur.

      The cipher text produced by AES/GCM MUST replace the bytes used to
      define the plain text in the security target block's block-type-
      specific data field.  The block length of the security target MUST
      be updated if the generated cipher text is larger than the plain




Birrane                  Expires August 19, 2021               [Page 19]

      text (which can occur when the authentication tag is included in
      the cipher text calculation, as discussed in Section 4.4).

      The authentication tag calculated by the AES/GCM cipher MUST be
      added as a security result for the security target in the BCB
      holding results for this security operation.

      Cases where the authentication tag is generated as part of the
      cipher text MUST be processed as described in Section 4.4.

   Finally, the BCB containing information about this security operation
   MUST be updated as follows.  These operations may occur in any order.

      The security context ID for the BCB MUST be set to the context
      identifier for BCB-AES-GCM.

      The IV input to the cipher MUST be added as the IV security
      parameter for the BCB.

      Any local flags used to generated AAD for this cipher MUST be
      added as the AAD Scope flags security parameter for the BCB.

      The encryption key MAY be encapsulated using some key
      encapsulation mechanism (to include encrypting with a key
      encryption key) and the results of the encapsulation added as the
      Encapsulated Key security parameter for the BCB.

      The key length used by this security context MUST be considered
      when setting the AES Variant security parameter for the BCB if it
      differs from the default AES Variant.  Otherwise, the AES Variant
      MAY be omitted if doing so provides a useful reduction in message
      sizes.

   Problems encountered in the encryption MUST be processed in
   accordance with local security policy.  This MAY include restoring a
   CRC value removed from the target block prior to encryption, if the
   target block is allowed to be transmitted after an encryption error.

4.7.2.  Decryption

   During encryption, five inputs are prepared for input to the AES/GCM
   cipher: the decryption key, the Initialization Vector (IV), the
   security target cipher text to be decrypted, any additional
   authenticated data, and the authentication tag generated from the
   original encryption.  These data items MUST be generated as follows.

      The decryption key MUST be derived using the Encapsulated Key
      security parameter if such a parameter is included in the security



Birrane                  Expires August 19, 2021               [Page 20]

      context parameters of the BCB.  Otherwise this key MUST be derived
      in accordance with security policy at the decrypting node as
      discussed in Section 4.5.

      The Initialization Vector (IV) MUST be set to the value of the IV
      security parameter included in the BCB.  If the IV parameter is
      not included as a security parameter, an IV MAY be derived as a
      function of local security policy and other BCB contents or a lack
      of an IV security parameter in the BCB MAY be treated as an error
      by the decrypting node.

      The security target cipher text for decryption MUST be generated
      as discussed in Section 4.6.1.

      Additional authenticated data, if present, MUST be generated as
      discussed in Section 4.6.2 with the value of AAD Scope flags being
      taken from the AAD Scope flags security context parameter.  If the
      AAD Scope flags parameter is not included in the security context
      parameters then these flags MAY be derived from local security
      policy in cases where the set of such flags is determinable in the
      network.

      The authentication tag MUST be present in the BCB security context
      parameters field if additional authenticated data are defined for
      the BCB (either in the AAD Scope flags parameter or as specified
      by local policy).  This tag MUST be 128 bits in length.

   Upon successful decryption the following actions MUST occur.

      The plain text produced by AES/GCM MUST replace the bytes used to
      define the cipher text in the security target block's block-type-
      specific data field.  Any changes to the security target block
      length field MUST be corrected in cases where the plain text has a
      different length than the replaced cipher text.

   If the security acceptor is not the bundle destination and if no
   other integrity or confidentiality service is being applied to the
   target block, then a CRC MUST be included for the target block.  The
   CRC type, as determined by policy, is set in the target block's CRC
   type field and the corresponding CRC value is added as the CRC field
   for that block.

   If the cipher text fails to authenticate, if any needed parameters
   are missing, or if there are other problems in the decryption then
   the decryption MUST be treated as failed and processed in accordance
   with local security policy.

5.1.  Security Context Identifiers

   This specification allocates two security context identifiers from
   the "BPSec Security Context Identifier" registry defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dtn-bpsec].

       Additional Entries for the BPSec Security Context Identifiers
                                 Registry:

                 +-------+---------------+---------------+
                 | Value |  Description  |   Reference   |
                 +-------+---------------+---------------+
                 |  TBA  | BIB-HMAC-SHA2 | This document |
                 |  TBA  |  BCB-AES-GCM  | This document |
                 +-------+---------------+---------------+
