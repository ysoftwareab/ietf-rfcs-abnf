1.  Introduction

   Large or never-ending sequences of values pose a problem for JSON
   that is well explained in the motivation for JSON Text Sequences
   [RFC7464].  GeoJSON [RFC7946] faces the same kind of problem:
   geographic datasets often run to the tens of thousands or millions of
   features.  The problem is often amplified by the presence of large
   arrays of coordinates for each of the features.

   This document describes a specialization of JSON Text Sequences.  A
   GeoJSON Text Sequence is a document of possibly infinite size
   containing one or more GeoJSON objects, e.g., multiple GeoJSON texts
   that can be parsed and produced incrementally, and not only a single
   GeoJSON FeatureCollection, Feature, or Geometry.

   The advantage of using ASCII character RS "0x1e" to denote a text is
   that sequence producers and parsers need not enforce a canonical form
   of GeoJSON.  Any valid GeoJSON, pretty-printed or compact, can be
   used in a GeoJSON text sequence.  Additionally, GeoJSON text
   sequences inherit from the other [RFC7464] rules for consistent
   processing of sequences with potentially corrupted texts.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  GeoJSON Text Sequence Format

   Defined in prose, following [RFC7464]: a GeoJSON text sequence is any
   number of GeoJSON [RFC7946] texts, each encoded in UTF-8 [RFC3629],
   each preceded by one ASCII RS character, and each followed by a line
   feed (LF).

   The GeoJSON Text Sequence Format conforms to all the rules of
   [RFC7464] and adds the following constraint: each JSON text MUST
   contain a single GeoJSON object as defined in [RFC7946].

   Heterogeneous sequences containing a mix of GeoJSON Geometry,
   Feature, and FeatureCollection objects are permitted.  How producers
   and parsers of GeoJSON text sequences communicate rules for allowed
   GeoJSON types in exchanged sequences is not specified in this
   document.

3.  Security Considerations

   GeoJSON text sequences have no security considerations beyond those
   of JSON text sequences and the GeoJSON format.

4.  Interoperability Considerations

   A variety of parsers designed for newline-delimited sequences of
   compact JSON text are deployed on the internet today.  While there is
   no canonical form for JSON texts, and pretty-printed and compact
   forms are equally valid, GeoJSON text sequences containing compact
   GeoJSON texts with no internal newlines are more interoperable with
   existing non-standardized parsers.

   In a distributed system where order and exactly-once delivery of
   messages are difficult to achieve, GeoJSON text sequences that do not
   rely on order of texts for extra semantics are more interoperable
   than those that do.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The MIME media type for GeoJSON feature sequences is application/
   geo+json-seq.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  geo+json-seq

   Required parameters:  n/a

   Optional parameters:  n/a

   Encoding considerations:  binary

   Security considerations:  See Section 3 above

   Interoperability considerations:  See Section 4 abovee

   Published specification:  [[This document]]

   Applications that use this media type:  No known applications
      currently use this media type.  This media type is intended for
      GeoJSON applications currently using colloquial line-delimited
      variants of GeoJSON.

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s):  n/a

      File extension(s):  n/a

      Macintosh file type code:  n/a
