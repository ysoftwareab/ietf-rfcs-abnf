Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Cause URI parameter for Service Number
                              translation
           draft-mohali-dispatch-cause-for-service-number-00

Abstract

   [RFC4458] defines a "cause" URI parameter as having predefined values
   for Redirecting reasons as a mapping from ITU-T Q.732.2-5 Redirecting
   Reasons.  The "cause" URI parameter is to be used in SIP or SIPs URI.
   In particular, it may appear in the History-Info header defined in
   [RFC7044] that MUST be added in retargeted requests.
   This specification creates a new predefined value for cases when the
   retargeting is caused by a specific service action leading to a
   called number translation.
   This document updates [RFC4458].

1.  Introduction

   The History-Info header [RFC7044] provides a mechanism to capture the
   history information associated with a Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP) request.  This capability enables many enhanced services by
   providing the information as to how and why a SIP request arrives at
   a specific application or user.

   To be able to filter specific entries among the history information,
   tags have been defined in [RFC7044].  For instance, the "mp" tag
   allows identifying, retargeting that are result of a decision made by
   a particular type of application or that an initial request has been
   retargeted as a result of an application decision in a general
   manner.  The "mp" tag is added when the target was determined based
   on a mapping to a user other than the target user associated with the
   Request-URI being retargeted.

   Additionally, a mechanism has been defined in [RFC4458] to add a
   "cause" parameter in the target URI to be able to identify
   retargeting due to the call forwarding supplementary services form
   other retargetings.  This "cause" parameter has defined values
   equivalent to the TDM Redirecting reasons.

   There is no solution to identify other reasons for retargeting than
   call forwarding service whereas some others already exist in PSTN/
   ISDN.  In particular, it is the case for IN services number
   translation identified in ISUP by the "called IN number" and the
   "original called IN number".

   Cause is a URI parameter that is used to indicate the service that
   the User Agent Server (UAS) receiving the message should perform.

Internet-Draft    Cause for service number translation      October 2014


   This specification proposes a solution for well-known services such
   as premium or tool free services that are doing retagertings.

2.  Problem Statement

   A mechanism is required to identify URIs that are issued form a
   retargeting by a specific service similar to PSTN/ISDN IN services.

   This mechanism needs to cover at least the IN services that can be
   identified in the ISUP signaling in the "called IN number" and
   "original called IN number" optional parameters defined in
   [ITU-T_Q.763] and used in ISUP/INAP interworking as described in
   [ITU-T_Q.1600].

3.  Solution

   A new alternative value for the "cause" parameter of the 'sip:' or
   'sips:' URI schemes is defined.
   This value may be used in a 'sip:' or 'sips:' URI inserted in the
   History-Info header [RFC7044] when the "mp" tag is present and the
   URI is issued form a retargeting by a specific service similar to
   PSTN/ISDN IN services.
   As defined in [RFC4458], the cause URI parameter MUST be encoded in
   the target URI when generated by the service.


   The ABNF grammar [RFC5234] for the cause-param and target-param
   parameters is reminded below as it has been subject to Errata [ID:
   1409] in [RFC4458].  The Status-Code is defined in [RFC3261].

   target-param = "target=" pvalue

   cause-param = "cause=" Status-Code


   The following value for this URI parameter is added to the existing
   ones:



                   +---------------------------------+-------+
                   | Service Type                    | Value |
                   +---------------------------------+-------+
                   | Service number translation      | 380   |
                   +---------------------------------+-------+

4.  Example

   In this section an example will be provided to illustrate the
   application of hte new cause-param value.

   History-Info: <sip: ToolFree_service_number>;index=1,
   <sip: callcenter_addr;cause=380>;index=1.1;mp=1

5.  IANA Considerations

   [RFC3969] defines a 'sip:' or 'sips:' URI Parameter sub registry.
   [RFC4458] defines a "cause" parameter specified as having predefined
   values.  This RFC defines a new value for the "cause" parameter: 480.
   This RFC has been added to the references listed for the "cause" the
   "SIP/SIPS URI Parameters" sub-registry in
   <http:/www.iana.org/assignments/sip-parameters> for the "cause"
   parameter.


    Parameter Name         Predefined Values            References
    --------------         -----------------        ------------------
       cause                      Yes               [RFC4458][RFCxxxx]

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC4458] apply.

   A privacy service that performs the "Privacy: header" Service
   [RFC3323] must remove the cause URI parameter from the URI.  Privacy
   of the parameters, when they form part of a URI within the History-
   Info header field, is covered in [RFC7044].
