            Abstract 
               This document describes the proposed requirements for NDMP version 5. 
               This document assumes NDMP version 4 as a starting point. 

               The requirements focus on improved clarity and interoperability, 
               enabling a richer set of data management applications, and broadening 
               the scope of NDMP to become a true Internet protocol. This increased 
               scope increases the need for improved security mechanisms. 

               The document provides the input to a BOF session where the NDMP 
               community will discuss and prioritize these requirements. 

               The key goals of NDMP include interoperability, contemporary 
               functionality, and extensibility.

            Draft Specification   NDMP Version 5 Requirements            June 2001 


            1. Overview 
            1.1. Motivation 
               The goal of NDMP v5 is the definition of a protocol allowing data 
               management applications to control the administrative movement of 
               data between NDMP compliant primary, secondary and other storage 
               systems and applications without the need for data management 
               application software resident on storage system servers. 

               The control and data transfer components of the data management 
               session are separated. The separation allows complete 
               interoperability at a network level. The storage system vendors need 
               only be concerned with maintaining compatibility with one, well 
               defined protocol. The data management vendors can place their primary 
               focus on the sophisticated central administration software for data 
               management. 

               NDMP is targeted towards the process of administering the protection 
               of data for an organization. Included are tasks such as backup and 
               recovery, mirroring and replication, on and offsite archiving, and 
               more. 

            1.2. Scope 
               This document is the requirements specification for Network Data 
               Management Protocol version 5.  

               The primary scope of the NDMP v5 effort is to further improve 
               simplicity, clarity and interoperability of NDMP, to enable a richer 
               set of NDMP based data management functionality, and to broaden the 
               scope of NDMP to become a true Internet protocol. This increased 
               scope increases the need for improved security mechanisms. 

            1.3. Audience 
               This document is intended for use by software developers and 
               architects who will participate in the development of version 5 of 
               the NDMP protocol.  

               The reader is assumed to be familiar with TCP/IP networking, and with 
               the operation of data management software in general, and NDMP v4 in 
               particular. The user is not expected to have knowledge of internal 
               backup software behavior. 

            1.4. Terminology 
               This document uses the terminology from the specification of NDMP v4. 
               The following sections define new terms. 

               NDMP extensions provide additional functions beyond those provided by 
               the core NDMP. The core NDMP includes features needed to support 
               these NDMP extensions. See [1].

            1.5. Key Words 
               The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
               "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
               document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

            Draft Specification   NDMP Version 5 Requirements            June 2001 


            2. NDMP v5 Requirements 
               The following sections give a functional description of new 
               applications or capabilities that are considered for NDMP v5. It also 
               includes a description of the underlying capabilities in core NDMP 
               that are needed to enable such functionality. 

               Notice that we include in the v5 core the functionality that is 
               required to support certain proposed extensions. These extensions 
               form the infrastructure needed to enable more complex data management 
               capabilities. An example is restartability and checkpoint support 
               which will allow recovery from partially failed data management 
               operations. 

               The NDMP core will as a minimum include the basic mechanisms needed 
               to support checkpoint creation and tracking. Whereas, various 
               approaches to restarting from checkpoints may be implemented as one 
               or more NDMP extensions. 

               One explicit goal of NDMP v5 is to exploit existing Internet 
               standards where it is appropriate. For instance, in order to support 
               optimal network path selection we will attempt to rely on internet 
               based directory services for creating, storing, managing and 
               accessing the information used for selecting the optimal path. 

               Following is a list of approximately 30 features under consideration 
               for NDMP v5. The features are listed in prioritized order, the most 
               requested features are listed first. The ranking is based on a brief 
               review by some of the participants in the NDMP development efforts. 
               Work will be done to further prioritize and select the subset that 
               gives good value to the NDMP community, and that can be accomplished 
               within a suitable development period for v5. Currently our goal for 
               v5 completion would be fall 2002 or winter 2003. 

            2.1. Restartability and Checkpoints 
               Backup, recovery and other data management operations involve large 
               amounts of data, and often take many hours to complete. Currently, 
               when a failure occurs, the operation needs to be restarted from the 
               beginning. Often many hours of time and data protection is lost. 

               NDMP needs to provide the underlying mechanisms that enable data 
               management applications to create coordinated session wide 
               synchronization points in the data stream(s), and to be able to 
               restart the operation from a set of coordinated synchronization 
               points. 

               The synchronization point infrastructure needs to apply to all types 
               of data management sessions: backup, recovery, mirroring, etc., and 
               it needs to enable several different implementations of such 
               capabilities.

            2.2. Multi Source or Multi Destination Sessions 
               Devices or network paths participating in an NDMP session typically 
               have different bandwidth and latency properties. In order to fully 
               utilize the storage systems and networks, NDMP should be extended to 
               allow for more than one source or more than one destination within 
               one NDMP session. Examples are: 

                  - Moving data between two storage systems using more than one 
                  network connection, or 

                  - Moving data from N high performance storage system to M medium 
                  performance storage systems. 

               This enables so called speed matching. Multiple connections can be 
               used to shorten the backup or restore times, reduce the time lag 
               between two asynchronous storage systems, and more. 

               One application is so called "tape RAID", where a backup data set is 
               partitioned and distributed over several tape drives in parallel. 

            2.3. Security 
             
            2.3.1 Improved Authentication  
               NDMP currently supports clear text and MD5 based authentication 
               between DMAs and servers. Use of more secure contemporary 
               authentication mechanisms, including public key encryption and the 
               use of encrypted passwords must be investigated.  

            2.3.2 Firewall compatibility 
               The most significant issue for NDMP and firewall compatibility is the 
               lack of port range control for NDMP connections (control and data) 
               and the incompatibility of NDMP with firewalls implementing Network 
               Address Translation (NAT).   

               Port Ranges: 

                  For control connections, the DMA initiates a connection from any 
                  non-reserved TCP source port (1025 to 65535) to the NDMP "well 
                  known" destination port on the data/tape server (10,000).  The 
                  data/tape server then allocates a new non-reserved TCP port for 
                  the NDMP connection.  For control connections, the TCP source and 
                  destination ports can be allocated anywhere in the non-reserved 
                  range. 

                  Firewalls normally disallow or restrict inbound connections based 
                  on IP address/port combinations. Supporting a wide range of ports 
                  requires opening large "holes" in the firewall.  This is 
                  something security folks dislike.  Providing administrative 
                  control of the DMA and data/tape server port allocations, allows 
                  the ranges to constrained to manageable (and less vulnerable) 
                  sizes.  It more desirable to open a range of 50 ports than 64,000 
                  ports.

            Draft Specification   NDMP Version 5 Requirements            June 2001 


                  For control connections the problem is most evident when the DMA 
                  attempts to connect to a data/tape server residing inside a 
                  firewall.  For 3-way data connections the problem is most 
                  difficult when the data and tape servers reside behind separate 
                  firewalls.  Note for 3-way data connections the location of the 
                  DMA is not relevant.  The control connection is assumed to 
                  already be established and the data connections is really a 
                  server peer to peer connection being passed to each peer by the 
                  DMA. 

               NAT Incompatibility: 

                  NATs translate between registered IP addressed used for external 
                  connectivity and unregistered internal IP addresses to 1) allow 
                  use of unregistered IP addresses and 2) to hide the topology of 
                  the network behind the firewall. 

                  NDMP is incompatible with Network Address Translation (NAT) 
                  firewalls because IP address and TCP port information is conveyed 
                  as payload data between NDMP peers (connect_addr in 
                  NDMP_MOVER_LISTEN/NDMP_DATA_LISTEN replies and 
                  NDMP_MOVER_CONNECT/NDMP_DATA_CONNECT requests).  This address 
                  information is not processed by the translate logic of the 
                  firewall. The problem is evident when a data connection is 
                  attempted between two servers separated by a NAT firewall where 
                  the mover or data server listener is on the interior of the 
                  firewall.  The mover or data connect requests will contain 
                  internal network IP addresses which can not be used externally to 
                  establish the data connection. 

               The solution for port range control may not require a protocol change 
               (rather just administrative control of each NDMP entity).  The 
               solution for NAT compatibility seems to necessitate a protocol 
               change. 

            2.4. Standardization of Environment Variables 
               NDMP backup methods are typically based on the design of existing 
               tar, dump or cpio backup utilities. On unix or unix style servers 
               these utilities, as well as the NDMP data and tape servers, are 
               controlled via environment variables. 

               Currently there is little structure in the definitions of these 
               environment variables, there is redundancy, and there is no 
               definition of environment variables that are for NDMP use only. 

               The new requirement is therefore to introduce a system of NDMP based 
               environment variables, with naming conventions reflecting their use: 
               data, tape or filter services, for core NDMP or for use in standard 
               or proprietary extensions, etc.

            Draft Specification   NDMP Version 5 Requirements            June 2001 


               Another environment related issue is related to managing time stamps. 
               Currently incremental backups (level 0 - 9) use one global location 
               to store the time stamp for a backup of a certain level. If multiple 
               independent backups of the same file system are taken by multiple 
               backup clients, generating different tape sets, a race condition 
               occurs since all the clients will update the same time stamp. A 
               successive incremental backup will end up with less updates than it 
               should have had. 

               The solution is to transfer the time stamp to the DMA at the 
               conclusion of the operation, thus the time stamp is a per session 
               item managed by the DMA as part of the meta data set for the 
               operation. 

            2.5. Internationalization 
               NDMP currently use the ASCII character set. As the scope of NDMP 
               widens, NDMP needs to provide the infrastructure so that DMA's can be 
               developed for non-english speaking users, using non-english 
               languages.  

            2.6. Generalizing NDMP for non-UNIX environments 
               NDMP grew out of a Unix based environments. The applications and 
               storage landscape now include other operating systems such as those 
               developed by Microsoft, Apple Computers, as well as custom operating 
               systems used in network, server and storage appliances. 

               NDMP should be generalized such that it can be more easily adapted to 
               to these environments which have other sets of file and file system 
               attributes, and other properties different from the classic Unix' 
               environments.  

            2.7. Data Management of non-file system data sets 
               NDMP is currently aimed at moving file system data. iSCSI and other 
               IPS protocols bring block storage systems, data transfers and access 
               to the internet network. Some database vendors implement relational 
               database tables and files directly on the block device, circumventing 
               the file system. There are several other data sets formats in use 
               today. 

               NDMP must enable data management of data sets that do not exist in 
               file systems. These include volume or block based data sets or 
               storage systems and database data sets. 

            2.8. Snapshot management 
               The snapshot management interface defines a mechanism and protocol 
               for controlling primary storage file system images commonly referred 
               to as snapshots.  








            Expires August 2002                                         [Page 8] 





            Draft Specification   NDMP Version 5 Requirements            June 2001 


               Specifically this interface supports the management of automated and 
               manual snapshot creation, snapshot deletion, and snapshot directory 
               browsing as well as full snapshot recovery and selective file 
               recovery.  This interface provides functionality allowing snapshots 
               to be used to implement near-line data protection solutions that 
               offer faster backup and recovery times compared to traditional tape 
               based secondary storage.  

            2.9. XML Metadata 
               The use of the emerging XML standard in NDMP metadata would enable 
               easier integration between NDMP and other business and management 
               applications. 

               This requirement may be a component of the Internationalization 
               requirement. 

            2.10. Time out handling 
               When one or more component of an NDMP session fail, for instance when 
               a network connection is broken, or when a participating host fails, 
               there needs to be a coordinated NDMP session level strategy for 
               determining when failure has happened, how to report it or take other 
               actions, and how to recover from the failure. 

               This strategy should be coordinated with the foundation for restart-
               ability and checkpoints. 

            2.11. Additional Data Path Processing 
               Data management is becoming a wide area application. In addition, new 
               needs require additional processing of data as it is moved between 
               storage systems. 

               When data is moved to an off site archive over the network, data 
               compression may shorten the transfer time, and thus the window of 
               time a service is unprotected, by 50% or more. For data sizes of 10's 
               or 100's of Gbytes this time may amount to hours, and is therefore 
               significant. Another need is virus scanning of data that is being 
               archived or replicated between two primary storage systems.  

               These are examples where the data being moved in an NDMP session 
               require one or more additional step of processing between source and 
               destination. NDMP needs to be enhanced in order to allow for the 
               configuration of additional services that process the data stream. 

               In the following we will call these intermediate data translators or 
               filters for "(data) filter services".

            2.12. Archive or Secondary Storage Abstractions 
            2.12.1. Higher Level Archive Interfaces 
               The service interface to the archive devices such as the tape drive 
               or tape library is now at a very low level. The interaction between 
               DMA and tape is done via SCSI level commands. This implies that the 
               DMA needs to understand vendor specific aspects of the tape drives or 
               libraries. Since the SCSI bus on the tape host is exposed it also 
               leaves the tape host vulnerable if there are errors in the tape 
               interface. 

               A low level tape interface slows the adoption of NDMP, and slows the 
               development of NDMP based data management applications. The benefit 
               of a tape/archive model at a higher level is two fold: First it frees 
               the tape and library vendors from remaining mostly compatible with 
               old tape architectures, instead they can make the low level changes 
               necessary to yield a better balanced product. Secondly the DMA 
               vendors can omit the tape specific issues and focus on the 
               administration of the data. 

               NDMP needs to provide an alternative to the existing tape interface, 
               one that hides the device specific properties, and presents a generic 
               archive interface that give tape or library vendors the freedom to 
               provide innovation and greater added value. 

            2.12.2. New Archive Media 
               Archive media other than tape: CD's, DVD's, even disk based archive, 
               is gaining some popularity today. NDMP should be generalized to allow 
               for easy adoption of these and other emerging archive technologies.  

            2.12.3. Generalizing a Unix Based Tape Environment 
               The tape model in NDMP grew out of UNIX. Therefore the tape server 
               architecture is heavily related to UNIX, and thus harder to implement 
               in non-UNIX based operating systems. NDMP needs a tape model which 
               enables easier deployment and implementations across all the 
               operating systems commonly hosting tape or archival devices or 
               systems. 

            2.13. Optimal Network Path Selection 
               Due to the decrease in network cost, primary and secondary storage 
               systems typically have multiple network interfaces, and are often 
               connected to multiple networks or network segments. A file server may 
               have multiple Ethernet interfaces, plus interfaces to Fibre Channel 
               and other network fabric types. 

               Each interface may have different properties, based on the network 
               type, network topology and network loading. This may impact the peak 
               vs. guaranteed bandwidth, the reliability of the network, etc. 








            Expires August 2002                                        [Page 10] 





            Draft Specification   NDMP Version 5 Requirements            June 2001 


               Depending upon the requirements of the data management application, 
               it must be possible for the application to determine which of the 
               available network paths and interfaces provides the best fit for an 
               NDMP session. NDMP based applications therefore needs to provide the 
               ability to discover the properties of the network topologies so as to 
               enable the data management applications to configure an NDMP session 
               according to specified service levels. Primarily this should be 
               achieved by interfacing to and using existing or emerging protocols 
               for QoS management. NDMPv5 should interface to and interoperate with 
               these new protocols. 

            2.14. Server or Application Initiated Operations 
               Enterprise applications often use caching techniques to improve 
               performance. One implication of this is that the application need to 
               be "quiscenced" before backup; the applications' cache needs to be 
               flushed in order to generate a data set in the storage system which 
               is consistent, and can be replicated or backed up. Most database 
               implementations require this. 

               In automated IT environments this implies that it is the state or 
               operations on the applications which determine when data management 
               applications should start. 

               One way of enabling such external control of NDMP sessions is through 
               the primary storage system; applications can create snapshots (point 
               in time copies of the data set), when the data service or the DMA per 
               convention or per signal from the application sees the new snapshot, 
               it can initiate the session. 

               NDMP needs to provide mechanisms that  allow external programs, 
               including NDMP services, to initiate pre-configured NDMP sessions in 
               the DMA. 

            2.15. IPS: iSCSI, FCIP and iFCP 
               A new set of technologies is being developed in the IETF for 
               transporting block data over TCP/IP. In particular, iSCSI enables 
               servers to mount and read/write block devices that are connected 
               using Internet networks. With iSCSI primary storage devices can mount 
               tape libraries directly over the IP network. These new protocols 
               needs to be investigated to better understand if and how NDMP v5 can 
               integrate, expose and exploit their capabilities.  

            2.16. Restoring From a Partially Damaged Backup 
               When a tape set becomes only slightly damaged, for instance if two 
               tapes in a five tape backup has deteriorated, the full backup is 
               lost. It would be of great value to enable the recovery of those 
               elements of the tape or other backup media that was still intact. 








            Expires August 2002                                        [Page 11] 





            Draft Specification   NDMP Version 5 Requirements            June 2001 


               Notice that this is a post backup scenario, thus it is not a matter 
               of restarting the backup. Also, this problem is not solved by 
               restarting a restore, as the missing data is completely lost. The 
               issue here is to prepare the tapes or tape data with information that 
               enable the DMA to parse fragments of a backup and make use of the 
               fragments that exist. 

            2.17. Partial File Incremental Backup 
               Typical NDMP based backup methods support full and incremental backup 
               options. Full backups transfer all files residing in the specified 
               file system hierarchy to the secondary storage system.  Incremental 
               backups transfer only those files that have been modified since a 
               specified date (last backup timestamp, etc.). However both full and 
               incremental backups transfer the complete file contents regardless of 
               the amount of change to the file. 

               Many applications, such as databases use very large files. This 
               implies that despite minor changes in the data sets even incremental 
               backups can generate large amounts of data. 

               NDMP must be extended to support new backup methods that perform 
               incremental backups including only the modified parts of the file or 
               volume.  

            2.18. Distributing the Config Interface 
               Most of the messages in this interface is used to configure other 
               interfaces: data, tape, etc. A suggestion is therefore to restructure 
               the messages such that configuration messages for an interface is 
               part of this interface. 

            2.19. A Simple "Object Oriented" Architecture 
               Early discussions of "translate services", see 2.6.: "Additional Data 
               Path Processing", uncovered that one could generalize the interface 
               architecture of NDMP services such that all services were "core 
               services" and implemented a core set of the interfaces/messages, and 
               then specialized services such as  tape, data, encryption, etc. were 
               "sub-classes" of the general service class with their own specialized 
               interfaces and messages. 

               Additionally it has been pointed out that most of the messages in the 
               CONFIG interface really belong with the interface (tape, data, mover, 
               SCSI) that the message configures. 

               It is believed that re-architecture of NDMP according to these 
               objectives would make NDMP simpler to understand, describe, implement 
               and support.  

            2.20. Tape Verification 
               Backup data on tapes are typically lying unused and unchecked for 
               weeks or months. Archive data may sit off site for years. The tape 
               medium is not 100% reliable, thus when a backup tape set is needed 
               some or all the data may have been lost. 



            Expires August 2002                                        [Page 12] 





            Draft Specification   NDMP Version 5 Requirements            June 2001 


               NDMP should support the use of real or proxy data services to read 
               and verify that the tapes themselves are intact, and that the data on 
               the tapes is consistent in terms of data format and packaging format. 

               It is not clear whether this requires new support in NDMP, an 
               extension, or can be supported via the current  
               NDMP_DATA_START_RECOVER_FILEHIST message. 

            2.21. Data Stream Abstraction 
               Current NDMP backup methods exploit the design of existing file based 
               backup utilities such as tar, dump or cpio. New data management 
               methods for backup, replication, archiving and other services will 
               necessitate new data formats be conveyed between NDMP controlled 
               source and destination systems.   

               Even though NDMP has never attempted to define the data stream 
               structure between source and destination systems, existing NDMP v4 
               data channel services must be examined to ensure sufficient 
               flexibility exists to accommodate new data management methods and 
               associated data structures.  

            2.22. Supporting Contemporary File System Properties 
               NTFS and NFS version 4 supports "composite" files which include 
               multiple underlying objects, also called "streams". As an example, 
               some implementations support such files as hidden directories with 
               multiple hidden files. 

               During a recovery operation a problem arises when a DMA requests a 
               file which is composed of multiple distinct objects. The DMA requests 
               a single object, yet the NDMP session is responsible for recovering 
               possibly a group of objects, located at different places on a tsape 
               set. 

               NDMP must provide the underlying protocol mechanisms required to be 
               able to back up, mirror or recover such composite file objects. 

            2.23. Symbolic Links 
               Currently (v2-v4) the file history information does not include 
               information about the destination of a symbolic link. This seriously 
               limits the utility of recovering directories that include symbolic 
               links. The file history interface in NDMP v5 should provide the 
               necessary mechanisms that handle symbolic links.  

            2.24. Spooling 
               One implementation of an integrated check pointing and 
               restartability, and multi source/destination sessions is to partition 
               the data stream into "segments", and providing an intermediate 
               "spooling service" which will manage the placement of segment on 
               tapes, and provide both the multi source/destination multiplexing as 
               well as the restartability.

            2.25. File System Browsing 
               Currently (v2-v4) the file history information does not include 
               information about the destination of a symbolic link. This seriously 
               limits the utility of recovering directories that include symbolic 
               links. The file history interface in NDMP v5 should provide the 
               necessary mechanisms that handle symbolic links.  

               When looking for data to back up, NDMP relies on other file system 
               access methods such as NFS or CIFS to browse the data set. It would 
               be helpful if NDMP provided a native method for browsing of the 
               primary storage system.
