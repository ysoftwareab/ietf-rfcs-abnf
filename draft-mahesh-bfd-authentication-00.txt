1.  Introduction

   Authenticating every BFD [RFC5880] packet with a Simple Password, or
   with a MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm [RFC1321] and Secure Hash
   Algorithm (SHA-1) algorithms is computationally intensive process,
   making it difficult if not impossible to authenticate every packet -
   particularly at faster intervals.  In addition, the recent escalating
   series of attacks on MD5 and SHA-1 [SHA-1-attack1] [SHA-1-attack2]
   raise concerns about their remaining useful lifetime as outlined in
   Updated Security Considerations for the MD5 Message-Digest and the
   HMAC-MD5 Algorithm [RFC6151] and Security Considerations for the
   SHA-0 and SHA-1 Message-Digest Algorithm [RFC6194].  If replaced by
   stronger algorithms, the computational requirement of a stronger
   algorithms will make the task of authenticating every packet even
   more difficult to achieve.

   This document proposes that only BFD frames that signal a state
   change in BFD be authenticated.  The rest of the frames can be
   transmitted and received without authentication enabled.  Bulk of the
   frames that are transmitted and received have no state change
   associated with them.  Limiting authentication to frames that affect
   a BFD session state allows for more sessions to be supported for
   authentication.  Moreover, most BFD frames that signal a state change
   are generally transmitted at a slower interval of 1s leaving enough
   time to compute the hash.

   Section 2 talks about the changes to authentication mode as described
   in BFD [RFC5880].

2.  Authentication Mode

   The cryptographic authentication mechanisms specified in BFD
   [RFC5880] describes enabling and disabling of authentication as a one
   time operation.  As a security precaution, it mentions that
   authentication state be allowed to change at most once.  Once turned
   on, the document talks about every packet being enabled with
   Authentication bit and payload.  In addition, it states that an
   implementation SHOULD NOT allow the authentication state to be
   changed based on the receipt of a BFD Control packet.

   This document proposes that the authentication mode be modified to be
   enabled on demand.  Instead of every packet being authenticated, the
   two ends can decide which frames need to be authenticated, and
   authenticate only those frames.  For example, the two ends can decide
   that BFD frames that indicate a state change should be authenticated
   and enable authentication on those frames only.  If the two ends have
   not previously negotiated which frames they will transmit or receive
   with authentication enabled, then the BFD session will fail to come
   up, because at least one end will expect every frame to be
   authenticated.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication as an
   RFC.

4.  Security Considerations

   The approach described in this document enhances the ability to
   authentication a BFD session by taking away the onerous requirement
   that every frame be authenticated.  By authenticating frames that
   affect the state of the session, the security of the BFD session is
   maintained.  As such this document does not change the security
   considerations for BFD.
