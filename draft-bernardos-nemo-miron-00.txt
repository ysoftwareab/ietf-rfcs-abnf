Abstract

   The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roam
   and attach to different access networks without disrupting the
   ongoing sessions that nodes of the network may have.  By extending
   the Mobile IPv6 support to Mobile Routers, nodes of the network are
   not required to support any kind of mobility, since packets must go
   through the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA) bidirectional tunnel.  On

   the other hand, this introduces delivery latency - due to the
   increased length of the route - and packet overhead.

   This document describes an approach to the Route Optimisation for
   NEMO, called Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation for NEMO (MIRON).  MIRON
   enables mobility-agnostic nodes of the mobile network to directly
   communicate (i.e., without traversing the MRHA bidirectional tunnel)
   with Correspondent Nodes.  The solution is based on the Mobile Router
   performing the Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation signalling on behalf of
   the nodes of the mobile network.

1.  Introduction

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the
   terminology related to Network Mobility [1] and [2] (Figure 1), and
   with the Mobile IPv6 [3] and NEMO Basic Support [4] protocols.

   The goals of the Network Mobility (NEMO) Support are described in
   [5].  Basically, the main goal is to enable networks to move while
   preserving the communications of their nodes (Mobile Network Nodes,
   or MNNs), without requiring any support on them.  The NEMO Basic
   Support protocol [4] is the solution designed by the NEMO Working
   Group, consisting on setting a bidirectional tunnel (Figure 2)
   between the Mobile Router (MR) of the network (that connects the
   mobile network to the Internet) and its Home Agent (located at the
   Home Network of the mobile network).  This solution is quite similar
   to the solution designed for host mobility, Mobile IPv6 [3], but
   without supporting Route Optimisation.  Actually, the protocol
   extends the existing Binding Update (BU) message to inform the Home
   Agent (HA) of the current location of the mobile network (i.e., the
   MR's Care-of Address, CoA), through which the HA has to forward the
   packets addressed to the network prefix managed by the MR (Mobile
   Network Prefix, or MNP).

   However, because of the bidirectional tunnel that is established
   between HA and MR to transparently enable the movement of networks,
   the NEMO Basic Support protocol [4] introduces the following
   limitations:




Bernardos, et al.       Expires January 12, 2006                [Page 3]

   o  It forces suboptimal routing (known as angular or triangular
      routing), since packets are always forwarded through the HA
      following a suboptimal path and therefore adding a delay in the
      packet delivery.

   o  It introduces non-negligible packet overhead, reducing the Path
      MTU (PMTU).  An additional IPv6 header (40 bytes) is added to
      every packet because of the MR-HA bidirectional tunnel.

   o  The HA becomes a bottleneck of the communication.  This is
      because, even if a direct path is available between a MNN and a
      CN, the NEMO Basic Support protocol forces traffic to follow the
      CN-HA=MR-MNN path.  This may cause the Home Link to be congested,
      resulting in some packets to be discarded.

   In order to overcome such limitations, it is necessary to provide
   what have been called Route Optimisation for NEMO [6], [7], [8].  In
   Mobile IPv6 [3], the Route Optimisation is achieved by allowing the
   Mobile Node (MN) to send Binding Update messages also to the CNs.  In
   this way the CN is also aware of the CoA where the MN's Home Address
   (HoA) is currently reachable.  The Return Routability (RR) procedure
   is defined to authenticate new CoAs that the MN may use, thus
   securing the change that the CN makes in the IPv6 destination address
   (using the MN's CoA) of the packets it sends addressed to the MN's
   HoA [9].

2.  Protocol Overview

   The mechanism, called Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation for NEMO
   (MIRON), essentially consists in enabling a MR to behave as a proxy
   for nodes that do not have any kind of mobility support (i.e., LFNs),
   performing the Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation signalling and packet
   handling [3] on behalf of the LFNs.

                        Figure 3: MIRON signalling

   In order to enable packets to be directly routed between the CN and
   the LFN (avoiding the MRHA tunnel), the MR sends a Binding Update
   message on behalf of the LFN, binding the address of the LFN to the
   MR's CoA.

   Mobile IPv6 [3] requires an additional procedure to be performed
   before actually sending a Binding Update message to a certain CN (and
   therefore enabling the Route Optimisation between MN and CN).
   Basically, this procedure, called Return Routability (RR) - needed in
   order to mitigate possible security concerns [9] - is used to verify
   that the MN, besides being reachable at the HoA, is also able to
   send/respond to packets sent to a given address (different to its
   HoA).  This mechanism can be deceived only if the routing
   infrastructure is compromised or if there is an attacker between the
   verifier node and the addresses (HoA and CoA) that are being
   verified.  With these exceptions, the test is used to ensure that the
   MN's Home Address (HoA) and MN's Care-of Address (CoA) are
   collocated.

   Since MIRON proposes the MR to behave as a "proxy" (Figure 3), the MR
   has to perform the Mobile IPv6 Return Routability procedure on behalf
   of the LFNs.  This involves the MR sending the Home Test Init (HoTI)
   and Care-of Test Init (CoTI) messages to the CN and processing the
   replies (Home Test message - HoT - and Care-of Test message - CoT).
   These messages are sent as specified in [3], using the LFN's address
   as the source address in the HoTI message - which is sent
   encapsulated through the MR's HA -, and the MR's CoA as the source
   address in the CoTI message.  With the information contained in the
   HoT and CoT messages, sent by the CN in response to the HoTI and CoTI
   messages respectively, the MR is able to build a BU message to be
   sent to the CN on behalf of the LFN.  This message is sent using the
   MR's CoA as the packet source address and carries a Home Address
   destination option set to the LFN's address.

   Once the Return Routability procedure has been done and the MR has
   sent the BU message - binding the address of the LFN (belonging to
   the MR's MNP) to the MR's CoA - packets between the CN and the LFN do
   not follow the suboptimal CN-HA=MR-LFN path anymore, but the CN-MR-
   LFN optimised route (Figure 4).

   In addition to generating and receiving all the signalling related to
   Route Optimisation on behalf of the LFNs, the MR has also to process
   the "route optimised" packets sent by/directed to the LFNs
   (Figure 4):

   o  Packets sent by a CN are addressed to the MR's CoA and contain
      IPv6 extension headers (a type 2 Routing Header) that are not
      understood by the LFN.  Therefore, the MR has to change the
      destination address and remove the routing header before
      delivering the packet to the LFN.

   o  Packets sent by an LFN have to be also processed.  The MR, in
      order to be able to send packets directly to the CN, has to use

      its CoA as source address of the packets and has also to add a
      Home Address destination option to every packet (set to the LFN's
      address).

3.  Mobile Router operation

   The Mobile Router operation defined by the NEMO Basic Support
   protocol [4] is extended in order to be able to generate and process
   the Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation signalling (i.e., Return
   Routability and Binding Update) [3], since the MR is behaving as a
   "Proxy-MR" for their LFNs.

3.1  Data Structures

   In addition to the data structures defined in [4], the MR need also
   to maintain the following information:

   o  The MR extends the Binding Update List (BUL) to contain also some
      information per each LFN-CN communication that is being optimised.
      Basically the added fields are those described in [3] that are
      related to the Route Optimisation procedure defined by Mobile IPv6
      (such as IP addresses of CNs, binding lifetimes, Return
      Routability state, etc.), since the MR is behaving as Proxy-MR for
      the LFNs attached to it.

   o  The BUL is not indexed only by the address of the CN, since there
      is a different binding is per each CN-LFN pair.  Therefore, the
      address of the LFN has to be also included in every BUL entry.


3.2  Performing Route Optimisation

   Since the proposed optimisation has to be done per each LFN-CN
   communication, the MR should track the different ongoing
   communications that attached LFNs may have, in order to identify
   potential LFN-CN communications that may be worth to be optimised.
   Due to the fact that optimising a certain LFN-CN communication
   involves a cost - in terms of signalling and computation resources at
   the MR - it may not be worth to perform such a optimisation for some
   kinds of flows (e.g., DNS queries).  The decision about whether to
   perform Route Optimisation to a certain LFN-CN communication or not
   is out of the scope of this document.

   Per each LFN-CN communication that has been decided to be route
   optimised, the MR has to perform the following actions:

   o  The MR performs the Return Routability procedure as described in
      Section 2.

   o  The MR sends a Binding Update message to the CN on behalf of the
      LFN.  The BU contains the address of the LFN as the MN's Home
      Address (HoA) and the MR's CoA as the MN's CoA (the MR's CoA is

      the only address that is reachable without requiring any agent to
      be deployed to forward packets to the current location of the
      mobile network).  This procedure binds the LFN's address to the
      MR's CoA at the CN (i.e., an entry is added at the CN's Binding
      Cache).

   o  The MR processes every packet received from the CN as follows:

      *  These packets carry the MR's CoA as destination address, and
         also carry a Type 2 Routing Header with the LFN's address as
         next hop.  The MR processes and removes the Routing Header of
         the packet, checking if the next hop address belongs to one of
         its LFNs and, if so, delivering the packet to the LFN (with the
         destination address of the packet set to the address contained
         in the routing header: the LFN's address).

      *  [3] defines that IPv6 nodes which process a Type 2 Routing
         Header must verify that the address contained within is the
         node's own Home Address.  This is done in order to prevent
         packets from being forwarded outside the node, but MIRON
         changes the processing of this kind of routing header - at the
         MRs - to verify that the address contained within is an address
         of one of the LFNs the MR is acting as Proxy-MR.

   o  The MR processes every packet received from the LFN as follows:

      *  The MR's CoA is set as IPv6 source address.

      *  An IPv6 Home Address destination option, carrying the address
         of the LFN, is inserted.

4.  Home Agent, Local Fixed Node and Correspondent Node operation

   The operation of the Home Agent, the Local Fixed Nodes and the
   Correspondent Nodes remains unchanged.  The only requirement is that
   CNs must implement the Correspondent Node part of the Route
   Optimisation defined by Mobile IPv6 [3] (section 9).

5.  Conclusions

   This document describes a Route Optimisation for NEMO for LFN-CN
   flows.  The MR performs all the Route Optimisation tasks on behalf of
   the LFNs that are attached to it.  This involves generating and
   processing all the related signalling (that is, the Return
   Routability procedure and the Binding Update message), but also
   handling the packets sent and received by the LFNs, in order to
   enable the direct CN-MR-LFN route (avoiding the suboptimal CN-HA=MR-
   LFN path) without requiring any change on the operation of the CNs
   nor LFNs.

   The Route Optimisation here described is intended for LFN-CN
   communications in a non-nested NEMO.  However, nothing prevents this
   solution to be applied also in a nested NEMO, avoiding the last
   tunnel, or even all the tunnels if the MR is provided somehow with a
   topologically valid IPv6 address that is reachable without traversing
   any HA (for example, as described in [10]).

   MIRON has been designed and implemented within the framework of the
   European DAIDALOS project (http://www.ist-daidalos.org).  The
   implementation of the NEMO Basic Support protocol of MR and HA and
   the MIRON code at the MR have been done for Linux (2.6 kernel),
   mostly at user space (in C).  The implementation used at the CNs is
   MIPL-2.0 (http://wwww.mobile-ipv6.org).

   Conducted tests show that the performance obtained with MIRON is much
   better - in terms of latency and effective TCP throughput - than the
   obtained by the NEMO Basic Support protocol, specially when the
   "distance" (i.e., RTT) between the HA and the CN is increased.

6.  Security Considerations

   Because an LFN trusts its MR for the routing of all its traffic (both
   incoming and outcoming), allowing the MR to perform some signalling
   and processing on behalf of the LFNs attached to it does not
   introduce any new threat.  From the architectural point of view, the
   solution is also natural, since the Route Optimisation support
   defined by Mobile IPv6 [3] conceptually could be implemented in
   multiple boxes.  MIRON just applies this mechanism, by splitting the
   mobility functionalities among two different physical boxes, but
   actually the conceptual basis of the solution is the same as the one
   defined by Mobile IPv6.
