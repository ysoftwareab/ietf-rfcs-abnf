  Abstract 
   
    This document defines VC-ID-ASM, a virtual channel based inter-
    domain any source multicast protocol. Based on extended source 
    specific multicast, the participants join a virtual channel and a 
    shared tree is formed. The receivers receive the multicast traffic 
    along the shared tree, sense the source addresses and then initiate 
    the switch process from the shared tree to the source trees.

  1 Introduction 
      
    IP multicast model includes Any Source Multicast (ASM) and Source 
    Specific Multicast (SSM) models. ASM provides many-to-many packet 
    delivery, while SSM provides one-to-many packet delivery in IP 
    layer. 
     
    The typical intra-domain ASM protocol is Protocol Independent 
    Multicast Routing Protocols-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)[1]. In PIM-SM, the 
    multicast traffic firstly gathers to a Rendezvous Point (RP), and 
   
   Y.Chen et al.           Expires October 8, 2011              [Page 2] 
                                      
  Internet Draft     Virtual Channel Any Source Multicast       April.8 
   
   
    then reaches the receivers along the shared tree rooted at RP. When 
    the routers directly connected with the receivers (DRs) sense a 
    multicast source, they initiates join to the source and multicast 
    tree rooted at the source is formed. But PIM-SM has the following 
    flaws. (1) It relies on RP, and will cause heavy traffic at and 
    around RP. Computing and distribution the mapping of a group and a 
    RP will consume a great deal computing and bandwidth resource. (2) 
    It is complex, especially in the source registration process. (3) 
    It cannot support inter-domain multicast by itself. One inter-
    domain scheme is MBGP[2]/PIM-SM[1]/MSDP[3]. But the scheme has 
    serious problems in scalability, security, and group address 
    management. Another inter-domain multicast schema put forward by 
    IETF is MASC/BGMP. Because of its complexity, it is not widely used. 
    The above flaws baffle the deployment of the large scale inter-
    domain ASM application, and it is urgent to put forward a simple 
    effective inter-domain ASM protocol. 
     
    Compared with ASM, SSM is a simple. The typical protocol of SSM is 
    PIM-SSM[6], which is a subset of PIM-SM. The introduction of the 
    channel eliminates the dependency to RP and make it directly 
    support inter-domain single source multicast application. Inspired 
    by SSM, VC-ID-ASM, a virtual channel based inter-domain any source 
    multicast protocol, is put forward. It uses the extended PIM-SSM to 
    build a many-to-many inter-domain shared tree for initial group 
    communication and switch to the source trees when the receivers 
    sense the sources for the received packets' heads. Compared with 
    the other schemes, VC-ID-ASM is simple and can support inter-domain 
    ASM application by itself. 
     
     
  2 VC-ID-ASM 
   
  2.1 Many-to-many Group Communication and Group Address Consideration 
      
    The multi-source group communication process of VC-ID-ASM includes 
    two steps. 
     
    Step1: forming the initial shared tree and source discovery. 
     
    Firstly, a visual channel identifier <s,g>, including it supports a 
    specific ASM application, is published in certain ways (via web 
    pages, etc). s is an addressable IP address (commonly a address in 
    core network equipment, near the center of the participants) . s is 
    not the real multicast source, and it only tells the routers what 
    direction they should send the JOIN(for applying receiving the 
    traffic)/REQS(for applying sending the traffic) messages. g is a 
    multicast group identifier. Secondly, after the senders and 
    receivers get the channel address, they tell the DRs by sending 
    extended IGMPv3[5] (or MLDv2[6], for IPv6) messages that they want 
   
   Y.Chen et al.           Expires October 8, 2011              [Page 3] 
                                      
  Internet Draft     Virtual Channel Any Source Multicast       April.8 
   
   
    to send or to receive the group traffic. The routers send the 
    JOIN/REQS messages to the shortest path interface towards s, hop-
    by-hop. The routers along the shortest path process the messages to 
    create or maintain the (*,g) states, and the initial shared tree is 
    formed. Thirdly, the group traffic is transmitted alone the shared 
    tree and the receivers sense the real source set S={s1,s2,...,sm}.
    
    Step2: forming the source specific trees.

    Be aware of si in S by receiving the multicast packets, the 
    receivers tell theirs DRs they want the traffic of channel 
    <si,g>(1<=i<=m) by sending IGMPv3 messages. The routers send the 
    PIM-SSM JOIN messages to the shortest path interface towards si, 
    hop-by-hop. And the source tree rooted at si is formed. Then the 
    group traffic from si delivers to the receivers along the source 
    tree. When the traffic alone the source tree reaches the receivers, 
    they can optionally send IGMP or MLD message to leave channel <s,g>, 
    and the routers send extended PIM-SSM LEAVE messages to the

  Internet Draft     Virtual Channel Any Source Multicast       April.8 
   
   
    shortest path interface towards s, hop by hop, to eliminate the 
    (*,g) on the shared tree rapidly. 
     
    The routers need to run extended PIM-SSM to process JOIN/REQS/LEAVE 
    messages. Considering the compatibility with standard PIM-SSM, a 
    group address adopted by VC-ID-ASM must be a SSM address, and 
    specific reserved bits need to be set to identify that it is a VC-
    ID-ASM address. For IPv4 network, a special range in 232.0.0.0-
    232.0.0.255 can be divided out to denote VC-ID-ASM groups. For IPv6 
    network, a special value of the reserved 4 flag bits can be used to 
    denote VC-ID-ASM groups. 
     
    Take Fig. 1 as an example, the group senders are s1 and s2, 
    receivers are r1,r2,r3 and r4, and senders as well as receivers are 
    sr1,sr2 and sr3. Router i is denoted as Ri. The broken lines with 
    arrows denote the shared tree rooted at s formed by extended PIM-
    SSM, and the real lines with arrows denote the source tree rooted 
    at source s1 (the other source trees are neglected). 
    
  2.2 Initial Shared Tree Setup by Extended PIM-SSM 
  
  2.2.1 Virtual channel selection
  
    There are two methods to select a virtual channel s. The one 
    is that we specify a static s which is in the core network to be 
    the virtual channel. The other is that a s in the core network is 
    choosen using a selection algorithm, such as a random core 
    selection algorithm.
   
  2.2.2 (*,g) state 
      
    (*,g) state formed by extended PIM-SSM includes four fields 
    <*,g,ilist,olist>, where * means it can match any source, g is a 
    VC-ID-ASM group address, ilist is the incoming interface list, and 
    olist is the outgoing interface list. In Fig. 1, for (*,g) of R8, 
    ilist is {I4}, and olist is {I2}. For (*,g) of R9, the ilist is 
    {I1,I3,I4}, and olist is {I1,I2,I4}. Also, the (*,g) states are 
    soft states. The expirations of the interface timer and the state 
    timer will eliminate corresponding interface in ilist or olist, or 
    the whole state. 
      
  2.2.3 IGMP/MLD message extension and DR's processing 
      
    In VC-ID-ASM, a host needs to tell its DR that it applies to 
    send/receive group traffic or leave a group. The value of "Type" 
    field in IGMP/MLD message can be extended to fulfill this. Take 
    MLDv2 message for example. Its "Type" field includes 8 bits. Its 
    value is 130,131 or 132 represents the message is a Multicast 
    Listener Query, a Multicast Listener Report or a Multicast Listener 
    Done message. The field value can be extended as: when its value is 
    133, the message is a "Multicast Sender Report" message which 
    represents the host applies to send the group traffic. 
      
    When a DR receives a extended IGMP/MLD message, it creates or 
    maintains its (*,g) state. Diffident with standard PIM-SSM, when 
    receiving a Multicast Sender Report message from a host, it adds 
    the interface receiving the message to ilist of its (*,g) state; 
   
   Y.Chen et al.           Expires October 8, 2011              [Page 5] 
                                      
  Internet Draft     Virtual Channel Any Source Multicast       April.8 
   
   
    when receiving a Multicast Listener Done message from a host, it 
    removes the interface receiving the message from olist and ilist of 
    its (*,g). 
     
    Then, according the different requests from the host, the DR sends 
    JOIN/REQS/LEAVE message towards s. When sending JOIN message, it 
    adds the sending interface to ilist of its (*,g) state. When 
    sending REQS message, it adds the sending interface to olist of its 
    (*,g) state. When sending LEAVE message, it removes the sending 
    interface from ilist and olist of its (*,g) state. 
      
  2.2.4 JOIN/REQS/LEAVE message processing by extended PIM-SSM 
      
    In control plane, VC-ID-ASM uses extended PIM-SSM JOIN/REQS/LEAVE 
    messages to create and maintain (*,g) states. The type of extended 
    PIM-SSM message includes JOIN (for applying receiving the traffic), 
    REQS (for applying sending the traffic) and LEAVE (for applying 
    leaving the group). JOIN and REQS can be combined in one message, 
    and LEAVE must be used separately. The highest 3 bits in 
    "reversed1" field of SSM message specifies the type of the messages. 
    In the 3 bits, the bit from the highest to the lowest represents 
    whether or not ('1' or '0') expecting to receive the group traffic, 
    whether or not ('1' or '0') expecting to send the group traffic and 
    whether or not ('1' or '0') expecting to leave the group 
    respectively. 
     
    When a router r receives a JOIN/REQS/LEAVE message sent from a 
    downstream router on interface I, it processes the message as 
    follows. 
      
    1. If the message type is '100', '010' or '110', and r does not has 
       (*,g) state, r generates a (*,g) state, with its ilist and olist 
       be set {}. 
     
    2. If the message type is '1?0' (where ? represents '1' or '0'), r 
       adds I to the olist of its (*,g) state. 
     
    3. If the message type is '?10', r adds I to the ilist of its (*,g) 
       state. 
     
    4. If the message type is '??1', r removes I from the ilist and the 
       olist of its (*,g) state. 
      
    After that, suppose the shortest path interface from r to s is I', 
    r processes as follows. 
      
    1. If the set of the ilist and olist without {I'} is null, 
       indicating there is neither sender nor receiver downstream, r 

   
   Y.Chen et al.           Expires October 8, 2011              [Page 6] 
                                      
  Internet Draft     Virtual Channel Any Source Multicast       April.8 
   
   
       immediately sends LEAVE message (whose type is '??1') to I', and 
       eliminates its (*,g) state; 
      
    2. If the set of the ilist and olist without {I'} is null and r's 
       (*,g) state is a newly generated one, r immediately sends 
       JOIN/REQS message to I', or else, r sends JOIN/REQS message to 
       I' when JOIN/REQS timer expires; 
        
    3. If the set of ilist without {I'} is null and the set of olist 
       without {I'} is not null, indicating there is receiver and no 
       sender downstream, r sends the message with type '100' and adds 
       I' to the ilist of its (*,g) state; 
        
    4. If the set of olist without {I'} is null and the set of ilist 
       without {I'} is not null, indicating there is sender and no 
       receiver downstream, r sends the message with type '010' and 
       adds I' to the olist of its (*,g) state; 
        
    5. If the set of olist without {I'} is not null and the set of 
       ilist without {I'} is also not null, indicating there is sender 
       and receiver downstream, r sends the message with type '110' and 
       adds I' to the ilist and olist of its (*,g) state. 
      
  2.2.5 Switching from the Shared Tree to the Source Trees 
      
    After forming the shared tree, the group traffic will reach the 
    receivers along it. Being aware of a source address si from the 
    multicast packet header, the receiving hosts apply to join <si,g> 
    channel using IGMPv3 or MLDv2 messages, and the routers send 
    JOIN(si,g) messages to the shortest path interface towards si, hop 
    by hop, to establish the source tree rooted at si. 
     
    In VC-ID-ASM, the participants of ASM application can begin to 
    apply to send or receive the group traffic at a time point t1, and 
    should let the group traffic from all sources reaches all receivers 
    in a time period t2 after t1. That is, at the time point t1+t2, the 
    receivers should be aware of the source set S={s1,s2, ...,sm }. 
    After t1+t2, the receivers will send extended IGMP or MLD message 
    to leave <s,g>  channel, and then the routers send extended PIM-SSM 
    LEAVE messages towards s to eliminate the (*,g) on the shared tree. 
     
    According to above rule, after t1+t2, a new participant can not 
    take part in the group communication. While, the switching process 
    is initiated by the user's host; and the value of t1 and t2 can be 
    set in the terminal programs to meet the needs of the ASM 
    application. For example, in a video conference application, t1 is 
    set to 9:00 a.m. and t2 is set to 30 minutes, which means the 
    conference begin at 8:00, and after 8:30 a user can not take part

  2.2.6 VC-ID-ASM Packet Forwarding Rule 
      
    When a router r receivers a VC-ID-ASM packet P, whose source 
    address is si and destination address is g, on a interface iif, it 
    will forward the packet according to the following rule (related 
    functions can be found in [1], only PIM-SSM functions are 
    considered and the assert mechanics is ignored). 
     
    o-list = NULL; 
    if ((si,g) state exists) and (RPF check succeeds) 
         o-list= olist(si,g); 
         else if ((*,g) state exists) and (iif is in ilist of (*,g)) 
           {o-list = olist(*,g); 
            o-list = o-list (-) iif}; 
     Forwards P on each interface in o-list; 
      
    Above process shows that if a router is the intersection of the 
    shared tree and the source tree, it will firstly forward the packet 
    along the source tree. Take R8 for example. It has (s1,g) and (*,g) 
    state. When R8 receives a VC-ID-ASM packet, whose source address is 
    s1 and destination address is g, on interface I3, It will firstly 
    matches the (s1,g) state, and forwards the packet on I1 and I2, 
    which are in the olist of the (s1,g) state. 
     
  3 Security Considerations 
      
    All of the VC-ID-ASM protocol messages (Join/Prune and Hello etc.) 
    are identical, both in format and functionality, to the respective 
    messages used in PIM-SM.  Security considerations for these 
    messages are to be found in [1]. 
     
    It is recommended that IPsec authentication be applied to all VC-
    ID-ASM protocol messages.  The specification on how this is done is 
    found in [1].  Specifically, the authentication of PIM-SM link-
    local messages, described in [1], applies to all VC-ID-ASM messages 
    as well. 
     
    The denial-of-service attack based on forged Join messages, 
    described in [1], also applies to VC-ID-ASM. 
     
  IANA Considerations
