1. Introduction 

   The control plane is responsible for carrying the control information 
   or signaling of the IP network. Its major elements are various 
   unicast and multicast routing protocols. The control plane is very 
   central to the network. Attacking to the control plane may lead to 
   the collaps of the whole network. 

   The document tries to sum up the capabilities of control plane for IP 
   networks. 

2. Functional Capabilities 

   In the section , capabilities are listed to ensure the control plane 
   security.  

2.1. Route Authentication Capabilities 

   Routing protocol authentication prevents the introduction of false or 
   unauthorized routing messages from unauthorized sources. With 
   authentication configured, the router authenticates the source of 
   each routing protocol packet that it got from its neighbors. 
   sometimes authentication keys or passwords are configured between 
   neighbors. The shared keys or passwords are used to verify the 
   authenticity of routing packets. 

   2.1.1. Ability to configure/negotiate an authentication mechanism for 
             an interface 

   Capabilities.

   The device has one or more methods to allow the protocol to negotiate 
   or be configured an authentication mechanism (null authentication, 
   simple password authentication, MD5 authentication etc) to be used 
   between routing peers. The authentication mechanism implements data 
   origin authentication and integrity verification for any routing 
   update message from peers. Parameters related to the mechanism must 
   be set by administrator or management software, too. 

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Route Authentication([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7) 

   2. Authentication is configurable 

   Current Implementations. 

   Authentication is defined in most routing protocols. Basically most 
   routing protocols support 3 basic mechanisms: null authentication, 
   simple password authentication and MD5 authentication. Null 
   authentication doesn't provide any data origin authentication or 
   integrity verification service, and simple password authentication 
   provides very weak authentication capability and is subject to many 
   kinds of attacks. Relatively MD5 provides the security service in a 
   more secure manner than other two mechanisms by applying 
   cryptographic computation. 

   Considerations. 

   Null authentication and simple password authentication should be 
   avoided in IP infrastructure network unless a high trustable 
   environment is available.  

   The progress of cryptography makes MD5 collision feasible with 
   current computation technologies. Whenever possible more strong 
   authentication algorithm should be considered for candidate, such as 
   SHA-256.  

   2.1.2. Ability to generate authentication data for route update 

   Capabilities. 

   When sending a route update to a peer a device is provided capability 
   to invoke authentication algorithm to generate authentication data 
   for the route update. The authentication data is sent to routing peer 
   along with route update message. 

   Supported Practices.

   1. Route Authentication([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7) 

   Current Implementations. 

   Once configured with authentication mechanism, routing protocol will 
   invoke the algorithm to generate message authentication code(MAC), 
   which is carried in a specific field of the message, 64 bit 
   authentication field in OSPF for example. Typically MAC is generated 
   by applying a key hash algorithm (MD5 fro example) to the total 
   message or part of the message. 

   Considerations. 

   None. 

   2.1.3. Ability to verify authentication data of route update 

   Capabilities. 

   When got a route update message with authentication data from routing 
   peer, the device must be able to invoke a proper procedure to verify 
   the rightness of the data. If the data is not correct, the message 
   must be silently dropped. 

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Route Authentication([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7) 

   Current Implementations. 

   The receiver of the message applies keyed hash algorithm to the 
   message or part of the message and gets a MAC. If the MAC is same to 
   the one in the message, authentication passes. 

   Considerations. 

   None 

   2.1.4. Ability to rekey manually or automatically 

   Capabilities. 

   The device provides the capability to allow rekey the shared secret 
   by manually configuration or dynamic negotiation.  

   Supported Practices.

   TBD 

   Current Implementations. 

   Most device implementation allows administrator to configure 
   authentication parameters, including shared secret.  

   Considerations. 

   Dynamically parameter negotiation may be preferable feature for 
   operator to reduce the effort of configuration. 

   2.1.5. Ability to be extensible to other authentication mechanisms 

   Capabilities. 

   The routing protocol can be extensible to support other 
   authentication algorithm, such as SHA-1 or SHA-256.  

   Supported Practices. 

   This allows device to improve the security of control plane by 
   extending stronger authentication mechanism to routing protocols.  

   Current Implementations. 

   OSPF has an AuType field to identify the authentication mechanism, 
   new mechanism can be added to the protocol by defining new AuType and 
   relevant processing procedure.  

   Considerations. 

   Most current routing protocols use MD5 for authentication. MD5 is 
   proven a weak authentication algorithm and subject to some 
   cryptographic attacks. It is important for routing protocols to 
   support other authentication algorithm, such as SHA-1 or SHA-256, in 
   the future. 

2.2. Route Filtering Capabilities 

   In [FILTER] there are different filtering capabilities defined, some 
   filtering capabilities in [FILTER] are applied to route update.  

   Route filtering is a generic method which is important and used 
   widely in the field of the route security. We can prevent route 
   looping and black hole through deploying it properly. Route filtering 
   is also used to keep route information from leaking into illegal site 
 
 
Zhao                   Expires April 9, 2006                 [Page 6] 

Internet-Draft   Control Plane Security Capabilities      October 2005 
    

   and often be used to counter against some attacks, such as by 
   injecting false routes.  

   2.2.1. Ability to filter inbound or outbound route update 

   Capabilities. 

   The device has the capability to filter the incoming or outgoing 
   route updates according to configured filters. The receiver will 
   spend less CPU cycles and memory to process route updates once 
   inbound or outbound filtering is applied.  

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Route Filter([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7) 

   2. Ability to filter inbound and outbound([FILTER] section 2.1.10) 

   3. Filtering the inbound route updates is an effictive countermeasure 
      against spurious packets attack.  

   Current Implementations. 

   Most of the route protocols support methods to configure route 
   filters which permit or deny learning or advertising of specific 
   routes. 

   Consideration. 

   None 

   2.2.2. Ability to filter prefix for specific purpose 

   Capabilities. 

   Some address spaces should not be used globally. For example, for an 
   edge router the address blocks listed below should not be accepted: 

   loopback address, 127.0.0.0/8  

   RFC1918 address for private use, such as 10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12, 
   192.168.0.0/16 

   prefix for link local address 169.254.0.0/16 

   prefix for multicast address 224.0.0.0/4

   reserved address for IPv6/v4 interoperation 240.0.0.0/4 

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Route Filter ([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7) 

   Current Implementations. 

   It is an essential function to filter prefix mentioned above to a 
   edge router. 

   Consideration. 

   None 

   2.2.3. Ability to filter routing update by prefix 

   Capabilities. 

   Teh device is configured to explicitly permit or deny prefix received 
   in route updates from neighbors by applying IP address filters. 
   Implementation should support a rule set in which each element of the 
   set is a rule with a specific action(deny/permit) to a prefix. If no 
   rule is matched ,the default action is applied to reject the route 
   update. 

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Route Filter ([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7 

   2. Avoid injection of false routes.  

   3. Limit propagation of invalid routes  

   Current Implementations. 

   Most route protocols support the feature. 

   By this feature administrator can prevent false routes from 
   injecting and constrain the propagation of invalid routing 
   information. 


   Consideration. 

   None

   2.2.4. Ability to filter routing updates by protocols or ports 

   Capabilities. 

   The device provide a means to filter route packets based on the value 
   of the protocol field in the IP header or the port field in the TCP 
   or UDP header. 

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Route Filter ([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7 

   Current Implementations. 

   It is very common that more than one route protocols, such as OSPF 
   and BGP, run in the same router. IGP update messages from outside of 
   the route domain should be dropped. 

   It may be implemented by deploying ACLs. 

   Consideration. 

   None 

   2.2.5. Ability to filter routing update by TTL 

   Capabilities. 

   The device should provide a means to filter route packets based on 
   the value of the TTL field in the IPv4 header or the Hop-Limit field 
   in the IPv6 header. 

   Take adjacent routers for example,it is a good policy to drop the 
   protocols packets whose TTL is not equal to 255. 

   TTL filters should not be enabled by default. 

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Route Filter ([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7 

   Current Implementations. 

   When a router got a packet, it will decrement TTL(Hop-Limit for IPv6) 
   value of the packet by one. Thus, TTL spoofing is considered nearly 
   impossible. Furthermore, vast majority of routing peers are adjacent. 

 
 
Zhao                   Expires April 9, 2006                 [Page 9] 

Internet-Draft   Control Plane Security Capabilities      October 2005 
    

   TTL filter is a simple mechanism to authenticate origins and avoid 
   attack by spoofing a routing packet. 

   [GTMS] introduced a generalized TTL security mechanism which can be 
   used in several protocols. 

   Consideration. 

   It may be inadequate to use the technology where the situation is  
   multi-hop and the number of hops changes frequently. 

   If a router is in a environment where neighbor can be spoofed or is 
   not trustable the mechanism is not applicable. 

   2.2.6. Ability to filter routing update by neighbor. 

   Capabilities. 

   By default the device can learn routes form all available neighbors. 
   Neighbor filtering can be configured to explicitly permit or deny 
   learning route from specific neighbor.  

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Route Filter ([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7 

   Current Implementations. 

   By the method administrator can implement simple origin controlling 
   without cryptographic authentication. 

   Consideration. 

   None 

   2.2.7. Ability to filter routing update by route attributes 

   Capabilities. 

   Some route protocols, such as BGP, attach attributes after route 
   information. So route can be classified and filtered by the 
   attributes values. Processing of receiving route is flexibly 
   controlled. 

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Route Filter ([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7 
 
 
Zhao                   Expires April 9, 2006                [Page 10] 

Internet-Draft   Control Plane Security Capabilities      October 2005 
    

   Current Implementations. 

   Take BGP for example: router can filter routes received from BGP4 
   neighbors based on community names by either of the following methods. 
   A community is an optional attribute that identifies the route as a 
   member of a user defined class of routes. Community names are 
   arbitrary values made of two five-digit integers joined by a colon. 
   Administrator determines what the name means when community name is 
   generated as one of a route's attributes. Each string in the 
   community name can be a number from 0 - 65535. This format allows 
   administrator to easily classify community names. For example, a 
   common convention used in community naming is to configure the first 

   string as the local AS and the second string as the unique community 
   within that AS. Using this convention, communities 1:10, 1:20, and 
   1:30 can be easily identified as member communities of AS 1. 

   Router can filter updates received from BGP4 neighbors based on the 
   contents of the AS-path list accompanying the updates. For example, 
   if administrator want to deny routes that have the AS 4.3.2.1 in the 
   AS-path from entering the BGP4 route table, he can define a filter to 
   deny such routes. 

   Consideration. 

   The device may support this type of filter, only if it is applicable. 

   2.2.8. Ability to limit the number of routes learned from a specific 
             neighbor 

   Capabilities. 

   The device should provide a method to allow user to configure the 
   amount of routes that can be learned for a specific neighbor. 

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Route Filter ([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7 

   Current Implementations. 

   A potential malicious neighbor may attack the routing table through 
   injecting large amounts of routes which may result in the decline of 
   efficiency. So it is reasonable to limit the amount of routes that 
   can be learned from a specific neighbor. 

   Some BGP implementations has a ''Max Prefix-Limit'' feature. A BGP 
   neighbor would be shut down when the number reaches some threshold.

   Consideration. 

   None 

   2.2.9. Ability to limit the length of prefixes 

   Capabilities. 

   The device may has the capability to allow filtering route updates by 
   prefix length. 

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Route Filter ([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7 

   Current Implementations. 

   With this method attacks can be mitigated, such as attacks mentioned 
   in 2.2.8. In order to forge enough routes, the prefix length in false 
   updates will always be long. For the routers used for large ISPs, 
   prefix length in the routing table should be relatively short, so it 
   is adequate to limit long prefix. 

   Consideration. 

   Some IPSs declare that they will not accept the announcements whose 
   prefix length is greater than a specific threshold. 

    ''long'' and ''short'' are relative. Administrator may choose a proper 
   value according to the actual environment. 

   2.2.10. Ability to filter route redistribution 

   Capabilities. 

   The device should provide method to limit the scope of route 
   redistribution between different route protocols. 

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Route Filter ([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7 

   Current Implementations. 

   When more than two route protocols are available in a device in the 
   same time, it is neccessary to share route information among them. 
   Although route redistribution bridges between different route domains 
 
 
Zhao                   Expires April 9, 2006                [Page 12] 

Internet-Draft   Control Plane Security Capabilities      October 2005 
    

   and improves the flexibility of routing system , it may lead to 
   looping or black hole as well. Furthermore, if false routes injected 
   by the attacker are redistributed into other route domains(such as 
   BGP), the scope of the attack may be extended. Thus filtering 
   redistribution routes is necessary. 

   Some ISPs demand that an adjacent ISP should not configure unfiltered 
   redistribution from his interior routing protocol into BGP.  

   Consideration. 

   None 

2.3. log 

   2.3.1. Ability to log the failure of authentication  

   Capabilities. 

   The device has a capability to allow the failing authentication to be 
   logged. The log must be stored in non-volatile media of the device or 
   other log server. 

   Supported Practices. 

   Logging consideration ([PRACTICES] section 2.7) 

   Current Implementations. 

   Most devices provide logging function. A failing authentication 
   indicates a security violation of the routing peer or an attack by 
   malicious nodes.  

   Considerations. 

   None 

   2.3.2. Ability to counter and log denied packets 

   Capabilities. 

   The device should provide ability to counter and log denied packets. 
   The log data is important for the audit. It is unnecessary to log 
   everything, but the follow points should be captured: 

   Source and destination address

   Source and destination port 

   Protocol 

   Packet type 

   Time  

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Logging consideration ([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7 

   Current Implementations. 

   Logging is an essential function used for auditing. 

   Consideration. 

   None 

2.4. Route Flap Dampening 

   ''route flap'' means that a route's state changes from up to down or 
   down to up. When ''route flap'' occurs , the route process has to 
   insert or delete an item and the advertise update. That large amounts 
   of routes continue to flap will exhausting CPU and finally result in 
   DoS. The attacker can delete and insert routes to make route flap. 

   2.4.1. Ability to dampen route flap 

   Capabilities. 

   The device should provide ability to dampen route flap. 

   Different dampening algorithms may be involved in different 
   parameters. 

   Supported Practices. 

   Route flapping dampening is the primary mechanism to mitigate the 
   influence caused by flapping. 

   Current Implementations. 

   The function to dampen route flap may enhance the stability of

   BGP has implemented a dampening algorithm based on a penalty value. 

   Consideration. 

   None 

2.5. Architectural Security Capabilities 

   Protective measures can be taken to prevent date from the data plane 
   and management plane into the control plane.  In fact majority of 
   attacks aimed at the control plane are launched by the user in the 
   data plane. 

   2.5.1. Ability to isolate control plane from data plane logically 

   Capabilities. 

   The device should provide the ability to isolate the control plane 
   from the data plane. 

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Route Authentication([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7 

   Current Implementations. 

   Using routes authentication and origin filtering, it is ensured in 
    some certain that malicious users in the data plane can not 
    establish a session with the control plane. 

   Consideration. 

   None 

2.6. Ability to provide route confidentiality 

   Capabilities. 

   The device should provides a means to prevent routing information 
   from unauthorized disclosure. It is generally realized through using 
   encryption. 

   Supported Practices.

   It is not enough that only authentication is applied to route updates. 
   Through intercepting route information, the attacker may perform 
   analysis to the data and obtains the network topology. 

   Typically, a route protocol does not provide any encryption feature 
   by itself. The most common measure is to combine an external 
   encryption mechanism, such IPSec,SSL/TLS.  

   BGP can be deployed together with IPSec to ensure route date 
   confidentiality. 

   Consideration. 

   None 

2.7. Anti-replay  

   2.7.1. Ability to anti-replay 

   Capabilities. 

   The device should provide anti-replay mechanism to make it impossible 
   for an attacker to insert packet in the route traffic. 

   Supported Practices. 

   1. Route Authentication([PRACTICES] section 2.5.7 

   Current Implementations. 

   It is natural for protocol based on TCP that provides the slide 
   window mechanism and detects sequence numbers repetition. 

   Other protocols which are not based on TCP can combine with special 
   security protocols, such as IPSec, to provide the anti-replay feature. 

   Consideration. 

   None
