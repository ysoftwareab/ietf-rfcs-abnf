       Network Time Protocol Extended Information Extension Field
                draft-stenn-ntp-extended-information-01

Abstract

   The network packet format used by NTP has changed very little between
   NTPv1, defined by RFC 958 [RFC0958] in 1985, and NTPv4, defined by
   RFC 5905 [RFC5905].  The core network packet used by NTP has no spare
   bits available for reporting additional state information and no
   larger data areas available for larger amounts of information.  This
   proposal offers a new extension field that would contains this
   additional information.

1.  Introduction

   The core NTP packet format has changed little since RFC 958 [RFC0958]
   was published in 1985.  Since then, there has been demonstrated need
   to convey additional information about NTP's state in an NTP packet,
   but no backward-compatible way to usurp the few otherwise potentially
   available bits has been found, and no larger data areas are available
   in the core packet structure.  This proposal offers a new extension
   field that would contain this additional information.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Extended Information Extension Field

   The Field Type of the Extended Information EF includes a version
   specification, to make it easier to evolve this specification.

   OPTIONAL), 0x0109 (Extended-Information Version 1, MAC required),
   0x2109 (Extended-Information Version 1, MAC OPTIONAL)

   Field Length: as needed

   Payload: For Version 1, a two octet Content Descriptor field and a
   two octet Content Data field, as described below.

   Version 1 Content fields.

    Content Descriptor 1     Content Data 1
            0x0001         TAI offset in the low-order 8 bits, 24-31
            0x0002         Interleave Mode indicator in Bit 23
            0xFFFD         Reserved (Zeroes)

    Interleave Mode: 1 if the sender is in interleave mode, 0 otherwise

    NTP Extension Field: Extended Information Version 1 Content Fields

   Example: A system that wants to convey an offset to TAI of 36
   seconds, and show it is in interleave mode.
