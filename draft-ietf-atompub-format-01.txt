Internet-Draft                Atom Format                      July 2004


1.  Introduction

   Atom is an XML-based document format intended to allow lists of
   related information, known as "feeds", to be synchronised between
   publishers and consumers.  Feeds are composed of a number of items,
   known as "entries", each with an extensible set of attached metadata.
   For example, each entry has a title.

   The primary use case that Atom addresses is the syndication of Web
   content such as Weblogs and news headlines, to Web sites as well as
   directly to user agents.  However, nothing precludes it from being
   used for other purposes and kinds of content.

   Details of comunication protocols between software agents using Atom
   can be found in the Atom Protocol specification [Atom-protocol].

   [[ more motivation / design principles ]]

1.1  Editorial Notes

   The Atom format is a work-in-progress, and this draft is both
   incomplete and likely to change rapidly.  As a result, THE FORMAT
   DESCRIBED BY THIS DRAFT SHOULD NOT BE DEPLOYED, either in production
   systems or in any non-experimental fashion on the Internet.

   Discussion of this draft happens in two fora;

      The mailing list [1]
      The Atom Wiki Web site [2]

   Active development takes place on the mailing list, while the Wiki is
   used for issue tracking and new proposals.

   This document is an early draft and known to be incomplete.  Topics
   marked [[like this]] indicate where additional text is likely to be
   added.

1.2  Example

   A minimal, single-entry Atom Feed Document:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <feed version="draft-ietf-atompub-format-01: do not deploy"
    xmlns="http://purl.org/atom/ns#draft-ietf-atompub-format-01">
     <head>
       <title>Example Feed</title>
       <link rel="alternate" type="text/html"
        href="http://example.org/index.atom"/>
       <modified>2003-12-13T18:30:02Z</modified>
       <author>
         <name>John Doe</name>
       </author>
       </head>
     <entry>
       <title>Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok</title>
       <link rel="alternate" type="text/html"
        href="http://example.org/2003/12/13/atom03"/>
       <id>tag:example.org,2003:3.2397</id>
       <issued>2003-12-13T08:29:29-04:00</issued>
       <modified>2003-12-13T18:30:02Z</modified>
     </entry>
   </feed>


1.3  Conformance

   [[ talk about atom documents and atom consumers, and how requirements
   are placed on them ]]

1.4  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification uses XML Namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114]
   to uniquely identify XML elements and attribute names.  It uses the
   following namespace prefixes for the indicated namespace URIs;

   "atom":  http://purl.org/atom/ns#draft-ietf-atompub-format-01

   Note that the choice of any namespace prefix is arbitrary and not
   semantically significant.

   Atom is specified using terms from the XML Infoset



Nottingham              Expires January 15, 2005                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                Atom Format                      July 2004


   [W3C.REC-xml-infoset-20011024].  However, this specification uses a
   shorthand for two common terms; the phrase "Information Item" is
   omitted when naming Element Information Items and Attribute
   Information Items.

   Therefore, when this specification uses the term "element," it is
   refering to an Element Information Item in Infoset terms.  Likewise,
   when it uses the term "attribute," it is refering to an Attribute
   Information Item.

2.  Atom Documents

   This specification describes two kinds of Atom Documents; Atom Feed
   Documents and Atom Entry Documents.

   An Atom Feed Document is a representation of an Atom feed, including
   metadata about the feed, and some or all of the entries associated
   with it.  Its document element is atom:feed.

   An Atom Entry Document represents exactly one Atom Entry, outside of
   the context of an Atom Feed.  Its document element is atom:entry.

   Both kinds of Atom documents are specified in terms of the XML
   Information Set, serialised as XML 1.0 [W3C.REC-xml-20040204] and
   identified with the "application/atom+xml" media type.  Atom
   Documents MUST be well-formed XML.

   [[ Validity? ]]

   Atom constrains the appearance and content of elements and
   attributes; unless otherwise stated, Atom Documents MAY contain other
   Information Items as appropriate.  In particular, Comment Information
   Items and Processing Instruction Information Items SHOULD be ignored
   in the normal processing of an Atom Document.

   Any element in an Atom Document MAY have an xml:base attribute.  XML
   Base [W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627] processing MUST be applied to any
   relative URI reference present in an Atom document.  This includes
   such elements and attributes as specified by Atom itself, as well as
   those specified by extensions to Atom.

   Any element in an Atom Document MAY have an xml:lang attribute, whose
   content indicates the default natural language of the element's
   content.  Requirements regarding the content and interpretation of
   xml:lang are specified in XML 1.0 [W3C.REC-xml-20040204] Section
   2.12.  For convenience, the most important are summarised here:

      The content of this attribute must be a language tag [RFC3066] or
      an empty string (e.g., xml:lang=""), which indicates that there is
      no language information available.
      If an element does not have an xml:lang element, the first
      xml:lang attribute in its ancestors indicates the natural language
      of its content.

   [[ feedback as to whether this listing is helpful or not would be
   appreciated; re-stating the requirements of other specifications is
   tricky.  ]]

3.  Common Atom Constructs

   Many of Atom's elements share a few common structures.  This section
   defines a few such structures and their requirements, for convenient
   reference by the appropriate element definitions.

   When an element is identified as being a particular kind of
   construct, it inherits the corresponding requirements from that
   construct's definition in this section.

3.1  Content Constructs

   A Content construct is an element with arbitrary child content, whose
   properties are described by the following attributes:

3.1.1  "type" Attribute

   Content constructs MAY have a "type" attribute, whose value indicates
   the media type of the content.  When present, this attribute's value
   MUST be a media type [RFC2045].  If this attribute is not present,
   processors MUST behave as if it were present with a value of "text/
   plain".

3.1.2  "mode" Attribute

   Content constructs MAY have a "mode" attribute, whose value indicates
   the method used to encode the content.  When present, this
   attribute's value MUST be listed below.  If not present, its value
   MUST be considered to be "xml".

   "xml":  A mode attribute with the value "xml" indicates that the
      element's content is inline xml (for example, namespace-qualified
      XHTML).
   "escaped":  A mode attribute with the value "escaped" indicates that
      the element's content is escaped, as defined in
      [W3C.REC-xml-20040204] (section 4.6).  Processors MUST unescape
      the element's content before considering it as content of the
      indicated media type.
   "base64":  A mode attribute with the value "base64" indicates that
      the element's content is base64-encoded [RFC2045].  Processors
      MUST decode the element's content before considering it as content
      of the the indicated media type.

3.2  Person Constructs

   A Person construct is an element that describes a person,
   corporation, or similar entity.  It has the following children:

Internet-Draft                Atom Format                      July 2004


3.2.1  "atom:name" Element

   The "atom:name" element's content conveys a human-readable name for
   the person.  Person constructs MUST contain exactly one "atom:name"
   element, whose content is unstructured text.

3.2.2  "atom:uri" Element

   The "atom:uri" element's content conveys a URI associated with the
   person.  Person constructs MAY contain an atom:uri element, but MUST
   NOT contain more than one.  The content of atom:uri in a Person
   construct MUST be a URI [RFC2396].

   xml:base [W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627] processing MUST be applied to the
   atom:uri element's content.

3.2.3  "atom:email" Element

   The "atom:email" element's content conveys an e-mail address
   associated with the persons.  Person constructs MAY contain an
   atom:email element, but MUST NOT contain more than one.  Its content
   MUST be an e-mail address [RFC2822].

   Person constructs MAY be extended by namespace-qualified element
   children.

   Ordering of the element children of Person constructs MUST NOT be
   considered significant.

3.3  Date Constructs

   A Date construct is an element whose content is a W3C Date-Time
   string [W3C.NOTE-datetime-19980827].

3.4  Link Constructs

   A Link construct is an element that MUST NOT have any child content,
   and has the following attributes:

3.4.1  "rel" Attribute

   The "rel" attribute indicates the type of relationship that the link
   represents.  Link constructs MUST have a rel attribute, whose value
   MUST be one of the values enumerated in the Atom Protocol
   specification [Atom-protocol].

Internet-Draft                Atom Format                      July 2004


3.4.2  "type" Attribute

   The "type" attribute indicates an advisory media type; it MAY be used
   as a hint to determine the type of the representation which should be
   returned when the URI in the href attribute is dereferenced.  Note
   that the type attribute does not override the actual media type
   returned with the representation.

   Link constructs MUST have a type attribute, whose value MUST be a
   media type [RFC2045].

3.4.3  "href" Attribute

   The "href" attribute contains the link's URI.  Link constructs MUST
   have a href attribute, whose value MUST be a URI [RFC2396].

   xml:base [W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627] processing MUST be applied to the
   href attribute's content.

3.4.4  "hreflang" Attribute

   The "hreflang" attribute's content describes the language of the
   resource pointed to by the href attribute.  When used together with
   the rel="alternate", it implies a translated version of the entry.
   Link constructs MAY have an hreflang attribute, whose value MUST be a
   language tag [RFC3066].

3.4.5  "title" Attribute

   The "title" attribute conveys human-readable information about the
   link.  Link constructs MAY have a title attribute, whose value is
   unstructured text.

4.  The "atom:feed" Element

   The "atom:feed" element is the document (i.e., top-level) element of
   an Atom Feed Document, acting as a container for metadata and data
   associated with the feed.  Its first element child MUST be atom:head,
   which MAY be followed zero or more atom:entry child elements.

4.1  "version" Attribute

   atom:feed elements MUST have a "version" attribute whose content
   indicates the version of the Atom specification that the feed
   conforms to.  The content of this attribute is unstructured text.

   The version identifier for this specification is
   "draft-ietf-atompub-format-01: do not deploy".

4.2  The "atom:head" Element

   The atom:head element acts as a container for metadata about the feed
   itself.

   The atom:head element MAY contain any namespace-qualified
   [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114] elements as children.  Ordering of the
   element children of atom:head element MUST NOT be considered
   significant.

   The following child elements are defined by this specification (note
   that the presence of some of these elements is required):

4.2.1  "atom:title" Element

   The "atom:title" element is a Content construct that conveys a
   human-readable title for the feed.  atom:head elements MUST contain
   exactly one atom:title element.

4.2.2  "atom:link" Element

   The "atom:link" element is a Link construct that conveys a URI
   associated with the feed.  The nature of the relationship as well as
   the link itself is determined by the element's content.

   atom:head elements MUST contain at least one atom:link element with a
   rel attribute value of "alternate".

   atom:head elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:link element
   with a rel attribute value of "alternate" that has the same type
   attribute value.

   atom:head elements MAY contain additional atom:link elements beyond
   those described above.

4.2.3  "atom:author" Element

   The "atom:author" element is a Person construct that indicates the
   default author of the feed.  atom:head elements MUST contain exactly
   one atom:author element, UNLESS all of the atom:feed element's child
   atom:entry elements contain an atom:author element.  atom:head
   elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:author element.

   [[explain inheritence]]

4.2.4  "atom:contributor" Element

   The "atom:contributor" element is a Person construct that indicates a
   person or other entity who contributes to the feed.  atom:head
   elements MAY contain one or more atom:contributor elements.

4.2.5  "atom:tagline" Element

   The "atom:tagline" element is a Content construct that conveys a
   human-readable description or tagline for the feed.  atom:head
   elements MAY contain an atom:tagline element, but MUST NOT contain
   more than one.

4.2.6  "atom:id" Element

   The "atom:id" element's content conveys a permanent, globally unique
   identifier for the feed.  It MUST NOT change over time, even if the
   feed is relocated.  atom:head elements MAY contain an atom:id
   element, but MUST NOT contain more than one.  The content of this
   element, when present, MUST be a URI.

   xml:base [W3C.REC-xmlbase-20010627] processing MUST be applied to the
   atom:id element's content.

4.2.7  "atom:generator" Element

Internet-Draft                Atom Format                      July 2004


   MUST be a URI.  When dereferenced, that URI SHOULD produce a
   representation that is relevant to that agent.

   The atom:generator element MAY have a "version" attribute that
   indicates the version of the generating agent.  When present, its
   value is unstructured text.

4.2.8  "atom:copyright" Element

   The "atom:copyright" element is Content construct that conveys a
   human-readable copyright statement for the feed.  atom:head elements
   MAY contain an atom:copyright element, but MUST NOT contain more than
   one.

   The atom:copyright element SHOULD NOT be used to convey
   machine-readable licensing information.

   The atom:copyright element may be assumed to apply to all entries
   contained by the feed except those entries which contain
   atom:copyright elements.  The atom:copyright element MUST, if
   present, be considered to apply to the feed as a collection of
   entries.

4.2.9  "atom:info" Element

   The "atom:info" element is a Content construct that conveys a
   human-readable explanation of the feed format itself.  atom:head
   elements MAY contain an atom:info element, but MUST NOT contain more

5.  The "atom:entry" Element

   The "atom:entry" element represents an individual entry.  This
   element can appear as a child of the atom:feed element, or it can
   appear as the document (i.e., top-level) element of a standalone Atom
   Entry Document.

   When appearing in an Atom Entry Document, atom:entry elements MUST
   have a "version" attribute whose content indicates the version of the
   Atom specification that the entry conforms to.

   The version identifier for this specification is
   "draft-ietf-atompub-format-01: do not deploy".

   The atom:entry element MAY contain any namespace-qualified
   [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114] elements as children.  Ordering of the
   element children of atom:entry element MUST NOT be considered
   significant.

   The following child elements are defined by this specification (note
   that it requires the presence of some of these elements):

5.1  "atom:title" Element

   The "atom:title" element is a Content construct that conveys a
   human-readable title for the entry.  atom:entry elements MUST have
   exactly one "atom:title" element.

5.2  "atom:link" Element

   The "atom:link" element is a Link construct that conveys a URI
   associated with the entry.  The nature of the relationship as well as
   the link itself is determined by the element's content.

   atom:entry elements MUST contain at least one atom:link element with
   a rel attribute value of "alternate".

   atom:entry elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:link element
   with a rel attribute value of "alternate" that has the same type
   attribute value.

   atom:entry elements MAY contain additional atom:link elements beyond
   those described above.

5.3  "atom:author" Element

   The "atom:author" element is a Person construct that indicates the
   default author of the entry.  atom:entry elements MUST contain

Internet-Draft                Atom Format                      July 2004


   exactly one atom:author element, unless, in an Atom Feed Document,
   the atom:head element contains an atom:author element itself.
   atom:entry elements MUST NOT contain more than one atom:author
   element.

5.4  "atom:contributor" Element

   The "atom:contributor" element is a Person construct that indicates a
   person or other entity who contributes to the entry.  atom:entry
   elements MAY contain one or more atom:contributor elements.

5.5  "atom:id" Element

   The "atom:id" element's content conveys a permanent, globally unique
   identifier for the entry.  It MUST NOT change over time, even if
   other representations of the entry (such as a web representation
   pointed to by the entry's atom:link element) are relocated.

   For a given entry, the atom:id element's content MUST be stable
   across all Atom Documents published by the same entity.

   atom:entry MUST contain exactly one atom:id element.  The content of
   this element MUST be a URI.

5.6  "atom:modified" Element

   The "atom:modified" element is a Date construct that indicates the
   time that the entry was last modified.  atom:entry elements MUST
   contain an atom:modified element, but MUST NOT contain more than one.

   The content of an atom:modified element MUST have a time zone whose
   value SHOULD be "UTC".

5.7  "atom:issued" Element

   The "atom:issued" element is a Date construct that indicates the time
   that the entry was issued.  atom:entry elements MUST contain an
   atom:issued element, but MUST NOT contain more than one.

   The content of an atom:issued element MAY omit a time zone.

5.8  "atom:created" Element

   The "atom:created" element is a Date construct that indicates the
   time that the entry was created.  atom:entry elements MAY contain an
   atom:created element, but MUST NOT contain more than one.

   The content of an atom:created element MUST have a time zone whose

Internet-Draft                Atom Format                      July 2004


   value SHOULD be "UTC".

   If atom:created is not present, its content MUST considered to be the
   same as that of atom:modified.

5.9  "atom:summary" Element

   The "atom:summary" element is a Content construct that conveys a
   short summary, abstract or excerpt of the entry.  atom:entry elements
   MAY contain an atom:summary element, but MUST NOT contain more than
   one.

5.10  "atom:content" Element

   The "atom:content" element is a Content construct that conveys the
   content of the entry.  atom:entry elements MAY contain one or more
   atom:content elements.

   If @type="multipart/alternative", @mode MUST NOT be specified, and
   content element MUST contain 1 or more content elements.  These
   content elements MUST NOT specify @type="multipart/alternative" (i.e.
   only one level of nesting is allowed).  Consumers SHOULD look at all
   alternative content elements and determine which one is most
   suitable, based on which @type and @mode the consumer supports, and
   preferences specified by the end user (if any).  Consumers SHOULD NOT
   render more than one content alternative.

5.11  "atom:copyright" Element

   The "atom:copyright" element is a Content construct that conveys a
   human-readable copyright statement for the entry.  atom:entry
   elements MAY contain an atom:copyright element, but MUST NOT contain
   more than one.

   The atom:copyright element SHOULD NOT be used to convey
   machine-readable licensing information.

   If an atom:entry element does not contain an atom:copyright element,
   then the atom:copyright element of the containing atom:feed element's
   atom:head element, if present, should be considered to apply to the
   entry.

5.12  "atom:origin" Element

   The "atom:origin" element's content conveys the original source of
   the entry; e.g., the feed where the entry was first published.

   If the source is an Atom Feed Document, then the content of

   atom:origin MUST be the same, character-for-character, as that of the
   href attribute of the atom:link element that has a rel attribute
   value of "alternate" in that document's atom:head section (i.e., the
   XPath expression "/atom:feed/atom:head/atom:link[@rel='alternate']/
   @href").

   The content of this element MUST be a URI.  atom:entry elements MAY
   contain an atom:origin element, but MUST NOT contain more than one.

9.  IANA Considerations

   An Atom Document, when serialized as XML 1.0, can be identified with
   the following media type:

   MIME media type name: application
   MIME subtype name: atom+xml
   Mandatory parameters: None.
   Optional parameters:
      "charset": This parameter has identical semantics to the charset
         parameter of the "application/xml" media type as specified in
         RFC 3023 [RFC3023].  [RFC3023].
   Encoding considerations: Identical to those of "application/xml" as
      described in RFC 3023 [RFC3023], section 3.2.
   Security considerations: As defined in this specification.  [[update
      upon publication]]
      In addition, as this media type uses the "+xml" convention, it
      shares the same security considerations as described in RFC 3023
      [RFC3023], section 10.
   Interoperability considerations: There are no known interoperability
      issues.
   Published specification: This specification.  [[update upon
      publication]]
   Applications which use this media type: No known applications
      currently use this media type.

   Additional information:

   Magic number(s): As specified for "application/xml" in RFC 3023
      [RFC3023], section 3.2.
   File extension: .atom
   Fragment identifiers: As specified for "application/xml" in RFC 3023
      [RFC3023], section 5.
   Base URI: As specified in RFC 3023 [RFC3023], section 6.
   Macintosh File Type code: TEXT
