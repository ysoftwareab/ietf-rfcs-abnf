DNS Scoped Data Through Global '_Underscore' Naming of Attribute Leaves
                      draft-ietf-dnsop-attrleaf-02

Abstract

   Formally, any DNS "RR" may occur for any domain name.  However some
   services have defined an operational convention that applies to DNS
   leaf nodes that have a reserved node name, beginning with an
   underscore.  The underscore construct is used to define a semantic
   scope for DNS records that are associated with the parent domain.
   This specification explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines
   the "DNS Global Underscore Scoped Entry Registry" registry with IANA.

1.  Introduction

   The core DNS technical specifications assign no semantics to domain
   names or their parts, and no constraints upon which resource records
   (RRs) are permitted to be associated with particular names.  Over
   time, some leaf node names, such as "www" and "ftp" have come to
   imply support for particular services, but this is a matter of
   operational convention, rather than defined protocol semantics.  This
   freedom in the basic technology has permitted a wide range of
   administrative and semantic policies to be used -- in parallel.  Data
   semantics have been limited to the specification of particular
   resource records, on the expectation that new ones would be added as
   needed.

   As an alternative to defining new RRs, some DNS service enhancements
   reuse an existing resource record, but have specified a restricted
   scope for its occurrence.  That scope is a leaf node, within which
   the uses of specific resource records can be formally defined and
   constrained.  The leaf has a distinguished naming convention: It uses
   a reserved DNS node name that begins with an underscore ("_").
   Because the DNS rules for a "host" (host name) are not allowed to use
   the underscore character, this distinguishes the underscore name from
   all legal host names [RFC1035].  Effectively, this convention for
   leaf node naming creates a space for attributes that are associated
   with the parent domain, one level up.

   One example is the "SRV" record [RFC2782] which generalizes concepts
   long-used for email routing by the "MX" record [RFC0974][RFC5321].
   An equivalent usage to "SRV" is the "URI" "RR" [RFC7553].  Relying on

   special DNS names has significant benefits and detriments.  Some of
   these are explored in [RFC5507].

   [Comment]:    The terms "resolution context" and "scoping rules" have
      been suggested, in place of "semantic scope".  In order to avoid
      concern for matters of semantics, this specification uses the term
      "scoping rules", to create a focus on the mechanics being defined,
      rather than nuances of interpretation for the mechanism.

   The scoping feature is particularly useful when generalized resource
   records are used -- notably "TXT", "SRV" and "URI".  It provides
   efficient separation of one use of them from others.  Absent this
   separation, an undifferentiated mass of these "RR"s is returned to
   the DNS client, which then must parse through the internals of the
   records in the hope of finding ones that are relevant.  Worse, in
   some cases the results are ambiguous because the records do not
   adequately self-identify.  With underscore-based scoping, only the
   relevant "RR"s are returned.

   This specification discusses the underscore "attribute" enhancement,
   provides an explicit definition of it, and establishes an IANA
   registry for the highest-level reserved names that begin with
   _underscore; underscore-based names that are farther down the
   hierarchy is handled within the scope of the highest-level
   _underscore name.  It updates the many existing specifications that
   have defined underscore names, in order to aggregate the references
   to a single IANA table.

   Discussion Venue:    Discussion about this draft should be directed
      to the dnsop@ietf.org [1] mailing list.

2.  Scaling Benefits and TXT and SRV Resource Records

   Some resource records are generic and support a variety of uses.
   Each additional use defines its own rules and, possibly, its own
   internal syntax and node-naming conventions to distinguish among
   particular types.  The "TXT" and "SRV" records are notable examples.
   Used freely, some of these approaches scale poorly, particularly when
   the same "RR" can be present in the same leaf node, but with
   different uses.  An increasingly-popular approach, with excellent
   scaling properties, uses an underscore-based name, at a defined place
   in the DNS tree, so as to constrain to particular uses for particular
   "RR"s farther down the branch using that name.  This means that a
   direct lookup produces only the desired records, at no greater cost
   than a typical DNS lookup.

   In the case of "TXT" records, different uses have developed largely
   without coordination.  One side-effect is that there is no

Internet-Draft                DNS AttrLeaf                    March 2017


   consistently distinguishable internal syntax for the record; even the
   inefficiencies of internal inspection might not provide a reliable
   means of distinguishing among the different uses.  Underscore-based
   names therefore define an administrative way of separating "TXT"
   records that might have different uses, but otherwise would have no
   syntactic markers for distinguishing among them.

   In the case of the "SRV" "RR" and "URI" "RR", distinguishing among
   different types of use was part of the design [RFC2782], [RFC7553].
   The "SRV" and "URI" specifications serve as templates, defining "RR"s
   that might only be used for specific applications when there is an
   additional specification.  The template definition includes reference
   to two levels of tables of names from which underscore-names should
   be drawn.  The lower-level (local scope) set of <"_service"> names is
   defined in terms of other IANA tables, namely any table with symbolic
   names.  The upper-level (global scope) "SRV" naming field is
   <"_proto">, although its pool of names is not explicitly defined.

   The current definition of a global underscore registry attends only
   to the "upper-level" names used for these RRs, that is the "_proto"
   names.

3.  DNS Global Underscore Scoped Entry Registry Function

   This specification creates a registry for DNS nodes names that begin
   with an underscore and are used to define scope of use for specific
   resource records.  A given name defines a specific, constrained
   context for the use of such records.  Within this scope, use of other
   resource records that are not specified is permitted.  The purpose of
   the Underscore registry is to avoid collisions resulting from the use
   of the same underscore-based name, for different applications.

   Structurally, the registry is defined as a single, flat table of
   names that begin with underscore.  In some cases, such as for "SRV",
   an underscore name might be multi-part, as a sequence of underscore
   names.  Semantically, that sequence represents a hierarchical model
   and it is theoretically reasonable to allow re-use of an underscore
   name in different underscore context; a subordinate name is
   meaningful only within the scope of the first (parent) underscore
   name.  As such, they can be ignored by this DNS Global Underscore
   Scoped Entry Registry.  That is, the registry is for the definition
   of highest-level underscore node name used.

                        Example of Underscore Names

   Only the right-most names are registered in the IANA Underscore
   table.  Definition and registration of the subordinate names is the
   responsibility of the specification that creates the highest-level
   (right-most) registry entry.

4.  DNS Global Underscore Scoped Entry Registry Definition

   A registry entry contains:



      Name:    Specifies a textual name for a scoped portion of the DNS.
         The name will usually be taken from the specification cited in
         the "Purpose" column and is intended for use in discussions
         about the entry.

      DNS Label:    Specifies a single _underscore name that defines a
         name reservation; this name is the "global" entry name for the
         scoped resource records that are associated with that name.

      Constraints:    Specifies any restrictions on use of the name.

      RR(s):    Lists the RRs that are defined for use within this
         scope.

      References  Lists specifications that define the records and their
         use under this Name.

      Purpose:    Specifies the particular purpose/use for specific
         "RR"(s), defined for use within the scope of the registered
         underscore name.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Per [RFC5226], IANA is requested to establish a DNS Global Underscore
   Scoped Entry Registry, for DNS node names that begin with the
   underscore character (_) and have been specified in any published
   RFC, or are documented by a specification published by another
   standards organization.  The contents of each entry are defined in
   Section 4.

   Initial entries in the registry are:

      { Enhancement of this table to include all underscore name
      reservations in effect at the time this document is published is
      left as an exercise to the readers... /d }

6.  Related and Updated Registries

      This section needs to contained details specification of the
      updates to existing underscore "registries", in order to have
      those specifications point to this new registry.

   Numerous specifications have defined their own, independent
   registries for use of underscore names.  It is likely that adoption
   of the proposed, integrated registry should render these piecemeal
   registries obsolete

   Registries that are candidates for replacement include:

      Instant Messaging "SRV" Protocol Label Registry

      Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Parameters

      Presence "SRV" Protocol Label Registry

7.  Security Considerations

   This memo raises no security issues.
