1.  Introduction

   Authorization policies are an important component of presence
   [RFC2778].  They allow the presentity to grant access to specific
   pieces of information to watchers.  Authorization policies haven been
   designed to be extensible.  For this reason
   [I-D.rosenberg-simple-common-policy-caps] defines a generic
   Extensible Markup Language (XML) based format for representing policy
   capabilities.  That format applies to many policy types, including
   location and presence.  This specification extends that one by
   defining policy capabilities specific to geographic location
   information.  Those policy capabilities correspond to the conditions,
   actions and transformations defined in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Furthermore, the terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy] is
   used.

3.  Structure of Geopriv Policy Capabilities

   The structure of common policy capability documents is defined in
   [I-D.rosenberg-simple-common-policy-caps].  In that specification,
   each policy capability document has three components - a list of
   supported conditions, a list of supported actions, and a list of
   supported transformations.  This specification merely extends that
   document with the conditions, actions and transformations defined in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy].  It does so by defining the following
   empty elements:

   o  civil-loc-condition
   o  geospatial-loc-condition
   o  civil-loc-transformation
   o  set-retention
   o  set-distribution
   o  keep-rules
   o  longitude-resolution
   o  latitude-resolution
   o  altitude-resolution
   o  provide-timezone

   Each of these elements indicates whether the respective attribute in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-policy] is supported.  All of these elements are
   defined within the namespace:

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:supported-geopriv-permissions

5.  Example Document

   The following document indicates that the identity, validity, and
   sphere conditions are supported, each of which is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-geopriv-common-policy].  It also indicates that the
   geolocation-specific condition named geospatial-loc-condition is
   supported.  Support of the geolocation-specific transformations named
   civil-loc-transformation, longitude-resolution and
   latitude-resolution is indicated by the three child elements of the
   <transformations> element:


   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <supported-permissions
     xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:supported-permissions"
     xmlns:sgp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:supported-geopriv-permissions"

        supported-permissions.xsd
        urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:supported-geopriv-permissions
        supported-geopriv-permissions.xsd">

     <conditions>
       <identity/>
       <validity/>

       <sgp:longitude-resolution/>

   </supported-permissions>
