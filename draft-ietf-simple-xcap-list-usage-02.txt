Abstract

   In multimedia communications, presence and instant messaging systems,
   there is a need to represent lists of Uniform Resource Identifiers
   (URIs). These lists, which typically reside on a server, can be
   subscribed to, in order to learn the presence status of a group of
   users. A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INVITE message can be sent
   to them, causing the creation of a conference call. This
   specification defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document
   format for representing resource lists. Such a document can be
   manipulated by clients using the XML Configuration Access Protocol
   (XCAP), although other techniques are permitted.

1. Introduction

   In multimedia communications, presence and instant messaging systems,
   operations are frequently performed on lists of Uniform Resource
   Identifiers (URIs). One such example is a presence list [13]. These
   lists are used by Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Instant
   Messaging and  Presence (SIMPLE) [9]Resource List Servers (RLS) [11]
   for processing list subscriptions. A presence list can also be used
   by a user agent that chooses to subscribe to each user in its
   presence list, rather than using a list subscription. In such a case,
   the client would read the list from local storage, and generate
   subscriptions to each member.

   It is common for users to share presence lists. As an example, user A
   may have three people in their list that they wish to tell user B
   about. User A would like to send an email to user B with an
   attachment describing these three people. Should user B open the
   attachment, the three people can be added to their own presence list.
   Doing this requires a standardized format for exchanging lists over
   email, instant messaging, and other communications protocols.

   There are other applications of resource lists besides presence
   lists. Another example is a list of recipients for an instant
   message, or a list of users to invite to a conference bridge.

   This specification describes a common format for representing such a
   list, and for describing the set of actions which may be performed
   against the list. Lists can be hierarchical, and can contain
   sub-lists referenced by a URI.

   Resource list documents can be manipulated by clients using several
   means. One such mechanism is the XML Configuration Access Protocol
   (XCAP) [7]. This specification defines the details necessary for
   using XCAP to manage presence authorization documents.

2. Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

3. Structure of a Resource List

   A resource list is an XML [2] document that MUST be well-formed and
   SHOULD be valid. Resource list documents MUST be based on XML 1.0 and
   MUST be encoded using UTF-8. This specification makes use of XML
   namespaces for identifying resource list documents and document
   fragments. The namespace URI for elements defined by this
   specification is a URN [3], using the namespace identifier 'ietf'
   defined by [5] and extended by RFC 3688 [6]. This URN is:

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:resource-lists

   A resource list document begins with the root element tag
   "resource-lists".  It consists of an optional "mandatory-ns" element
   (defined in XCAP [7]), followed by any number of "list" sub-elements,
   each of which is a resource list. Other elements from different
   namespaces MAY be present for the purposes of extensibility; elements
   or attributes from unknown namespaces MUST be ignored. There are
   three attributes associated with the "list" element. The first is
   "name". This attribute is a descriptive name for the list. It MUST be
   unique amongst all other list elements within the same parent
   element. It serves as a useful, but optional handle to identify a
   list.

   Each list element will also have boolean attributes which indicate a
   specific action that may be made against that list. This
   specification defines a single attribute - "subscribeable" - which
   indicates that the list may be subscribed to using the SIP event list
   specification [11]. This application usage does not provide any
   information on which users would be authorized to subscribe to the
   list, however.

   Extensions to this application usage MAY define additional boolean
   elements, each within a different namespace, for the purposes of
   indicating other actions that may be peformed. When an attribute is
   absent, it implies that the operation is not supported.

   The third other attribute, "uri" MAY be present. It provides a URI
   that can be used to access the list, for example, using the SIP event
   notification extension for lists [11]. As a result, the URI MUST be
   either a SIP URI or a pres URI [12].

   Each "list" element is composed of a sequence of zero or more
   elements, each of which may be an "entry" element, a "list" element,
   an "entry-ref" element, or an "external" element. The ability of a
   "list" element to contain other "list" elements means that a resource
   list can be hierarchically structured. An "entry" element describes a
   single URI that is part of the list. An "entry-ref" element allows an

   entry to be included by reference, rather than by value. The content
   of "entry-ref" is a URI that points to an "entry" element in this
   document or another. This URI MUST be an HTTP URI identifying an XCAP
   resource. An "external" element contains a reference to a list stored
   on another server. The content of this element MUST also be an HTTP
   URI identifying an XCAP resource. A "list" element can also contain
   elements from other namespaces, for the purposes of extensibility.

   The "entry" element describes a single resource. The "entry" element
   has two attributes:

      name: This optional attribute is a unique identifier amongst all
      other "entry" elements of the same parent.

      uri: This mandatory attribute is a URI that is used to access the
      resource. It MUST be either a SIP or pres URI.

   The "entry" element contains a sequence of other elements. Only one
   such element is defined at this time, which is "display-name". This
   element provides a UTF-8 encoded string, meant for consumption by the
   user, that describes the resource. Unlike the "name" attribute of the
   entry element, the "display-name" has no uniqueness requirements.
   Other elements from other namespaces MAY be included. This is meant
   to support the inclusion of other information about the entry, such
   as a phone number or postal address.

6. Usage with XCAP

   Resource list documents can be manipulated with XCAP. This section
   provides the details necessary for such a usage.

6.1 Application Unique ID

   XCAP requires application usages to define a unique application usage
   ID (AUID) in either the IETF tree or a vendor tree. This
   specification defines the "resource-lists" AUID within the IETF tree,
   via the IANA registration in Section 8.

6.2 MIME Type

   The MIME type for this document is "application/resource-lists+xml".

6.3 XML Schema

   The XML Schema for this document is defined as the sole content of
   Section 4.

6.4 Additional Constraints

   None.

6.5 Data Semantics

   Semantics for the document content are provided in Section 3.

6.6 Naming Conventions

   There are no naming conventions that need to be defined for this
   application usage. A subscription to a resource list will be to a
   specific URI. That URI will be one of the "uri" attributes defined in
   a list within one of the documents managed by an XCAP server.

6.7 Resource Interdependencies

   An XCAP server supporting this application usage need only worry
   about a single data interdependency - the "uri" attribute of the list
   element.

   If the "uri" attribute is absent in a document written to an XCAP
   server, but the "subscribeable" flag is true, the XCAP server MUST
   allocate a URI for this list. This allocated URI MUST be globally
   unique, and MUST route to an RLS which will handle list subscriptions
   for the list defined by the document. The server MUST set the uri
   attribute of the document with this URI.



Rosenberg               Expires August 15, 2004                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft             XML Resource Lists              February 2004


   A server MUST NOT delete the "uri" attribute, however, should a
   client change the subscribeable flag to false after the server has
   allocated a URI.

   If the "uri" attribute is present in a document written to an XCAP
   server, but the URI exists in another document managed by the server,
   the document is considered invalid. A server MUST reject such a
   request with a 409, and MAY include an XCAP error report in the body
   indicating this condition. The server MAY suggest, using the "alt-ns"
   element, alternate suggestions for a URI that is not currently
   allocated.

6.8 Authorization Policies

   This application usage does not modify the default XCAP authorization
   policy, which is that only a user can read, write or modify their own
   documents. A server can allow priveleged users to modify documents
   that they don't own, but the establishment and indication of such
   policies is outside the scope of this document. It is anticipated
   that a future application usage will define which users are allowed
   to modify a list resource.

Internet-Draft             XML Resource Lists              February 2004


7. Security Considerations

   The configuration information defined by this application usage is
   particularly sensitive. It represents the principle set of people
   with whom a user would like to communicate. As a result, clients
   SHOULD use TLS when contacting servers in order to fetch this
   information. Note that this does not represent a change in
   requirement strength from XCAP.
