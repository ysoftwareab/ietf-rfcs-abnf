Abstract

   This draft describes the mechanisms required to automatically
   configure a Customer Edge (CE) Equipment to support a VPN service
   offered by the provider (aka as Provider Provisioned CE-based VPN).

1. Motivation

   To offer provider provisioned CE-based VPN [CE-VPN] ( or CE-based
   Virtual Private LAN [CE-VPL]), a provider has to configure on a CE
   tunnel(s) to remote CE(s) of a VPN. In this document, the term VPN
   includes VPL.

   In CE-based VPNs, if a site of a VPN is added or removed, other CE(s)
   belonging to the VPN must be reprovisioned with the new or updated
   tunnel endpoint. It is desirable to have a CE to be automatically
   updated with the change in tunnel endpoints and for the CE to self-
   provision a new tunnel to a remote site.  This auto-discovery or
   update and self-provisioning features on CE shall be referred to as
   CE auto-configuration.

Internet Draft            CE Auto-Configuration                July 2002


   PP CE-based VPNs which do not require the provider to manually
   perform configuration on the CEs reduces the cost of offering VPN
   service. If CEs of a VPN are fully-meshed, using CE auto-
   configuration instead of manually provisioning CEs, reduces the
   provisioning required from O(n^2) to O(n), where n is the number of
   sites.

2. Overview

   Figure 1 below is based on Figure 1 from [CE-VPN] and shows the
   reference model for auto-configuration of CEs for PP CE-based
   VPN.

        Figure 1: Reference model for auto-configuration of CEs


   A VPN Configuration server is a server which can update CEs of tunnel
   endpoint information or/and where CE may request tunnel endpoints
   information.

3. VPN service parameters

   The parameters that can be auto-configured at a CE device to allow a
   CE to self provision tunnels include:

   i) the list of remote CE IP address(es)

   ii) the VPN identification

   iii) the role of a site (e.g. whether it's a hub or spoke)

   iv) the transform sets defining the security protocols and algorithms

   that shall be used by two CEs for encryption and authentication (for
   IPSec).

   The (pre-shared or CE's private) key for IPSec tunnels must be pre-
   configured on the CE. Other VPN service related configuration which
   do not change as sites are removed or added to a VPN may also be
   configured a priori or remotely (and manually) configured if the
   parameters do not change frequently. The intent here is to define a
   minimal set of VPN service parameters that should be auto-configured.
   Hence, this draft shall focus on the auto-configuration of tunnel(s)
   to remote CE(s). If necessary, the transform sets for IPSec and other
   service parameters shall be defined to be auto-configured in future.
   It is assumed for now, the transform sets configured on a CE shall be
   applicable to all the IPSec tunnel(s) to other CEs of the same VPN.

   The scope here are VPN service parameters, other service parameters
   related to managed Internet service, firewall configuration are not
   within the scope of this draft.

4. CE Auto-Configuration requirements

   The CE auto-configuration solution should:

   - minimize the number of parameters that must be pre-configured

   - minimize the number of parameters that shall be auto-configured

   - allow configuration of CEs within one AS (Autonomous System) or
   network provider

   - allow CE to auto discover/request tunnel endpoint information

   - be able to auto update CEs with new tunnel endpoint information

   - allow a CE to self-provision the tunnels to other CEs

   - allow a provider to provision tunnel information for a CE
   independent of whether a CE is up and running

   - allow authentication of the tunnel endpoint information

   - not allow a customer to tamper with configuration of a CE

   - allow a provider to explicitly add or remove sites of a VPN e.g. a
   tunnel setup or removal does not necessarily imply a site should be
   added or removed from the VPN

Internet Draft            CE Auto-Configuration                July 2002


   The CE auto-configuration solution may:

   - allow configuration of CEs in different AS (Autonomous Systems) or
   network provider

   - leverage providers' existing AAA infrastructure

   - hide or encrypt the tunnel endpoint information

   [Note: If a CE uses a private key/certificate pair tunnel
   authentication, the remote end CE can use the corresponding public
   key when authenticating the other end CE. In this case, the private
   key may be configured on CEs a priori, and not sent as part of the
   tunnel endpoint information.

   Alternatively, if [PIC, XAUTH] is used, a CE may request credentials
   from an Authentication Server instead, and there is no need to pre-
   configure a CE with a private key, instead the CE ID and the password
   may be pre-configured on the CE.  "It is assumed then that the CE
   possesses (e.g. by pre-configuration) the public key of the
   Authentication Server, or it has the means to obtain and validate a
   certificate for the Authentication Server (e.g., by pre-configuration
   of a CA (Certificate Authority) public key)" In this case, the CE
   credentials must be encrypted if sent as part of the tunnel endpoint
   information. Otherwise an independent key distribution protocol may
   be used to distribute keys, instead of sending the key as part of the
   tunnel endpoint information.]

   - automate IP address association with a CE of a VPN

   [Note: a provider may have to be informed of a CE location offline
   and has to manually associate an IP address (that the CE is reachable
   from a provider's network) with a CE  of a VPN. Hence it is useful to
   allow a CE to authenticate itself to a  VPN Configuration server and
   then to "register" itself. This allows a VPN Configuration server to
   associate the CE with its current IP address  or alternatively, if
   the CE is within the service provider's network, the VPN
   Configuration server may be able to assign the IP address to the CE
   (on the port facing a network provider), associate the CE with the
   assigned IP address and at the same time provide the remote CE IP
   addresses [See Appendix].

4.1 General Ideal Solution

   Ideally on bootup, a CE should be able to automatically perform
   procedures to gain network access if needed and obtain an IP address
   to allow it to communicate with other CEs in the IP network, e.g. via
   [DHCP] or for PPP links via IPCP.  Subsequently the CE shall request

Internet Draft            CE Auto-Configuration                July 2002


   tunnel information from a VPN Configuration server.

   CEs need only be pre-configured with :

   a) a shared key or private key/certificate pair or a password, to
   allow it to authenticate itself to the VPN Configuration server and

   b) a shared key or a CA's public key to allow it to authenticate the
   VPN Configuration server

   If a shared key is used, a CE may additionally be pre-configured with
   a CE Identification (ID) in some service deployment scenarios, e.g.
   where the service provider is not able to infer the "location" of the
   CE or infer from the IP address of a CE which CE it is communicating
   with.

   CEs may be pre-configured with the VPN Configuration server name if
   the CE is not able to discover the VPN Configuration server or if the
   server involved in the network access configuration process (e.g.
   DHCP Server or NAS (Network Access Server), see [L2TP]) cannot be
   leveraged as a VPN Configuration server.  If the CE is pre-configured
   with the VPN Configuration server name, the CE may find out the VPN
   Configuration server IP address via e.g. the DNS.

   A CE shall query or retrieve the tunnels information of a VPN it
   belongs from the VPN Configuration server.

   The VPN Configuration server shall authenticate the CE and provide
   the tunnel endpoint information to the CE, encrypting any information
   if necessary.  [To leverage existing AAA infrastructure, the VPN
   Configuration server may choose to authenticate the CE via e.g.
   RADIUS and obtain the tunnel information from the RADIUS Server as
   well. In this case, the VPN Configuration server is acting as a
   RADIUS client, and shall send the CE Identification and password to
   the RADIUS server See the Appendix for further discussion].

   The CE shall authenticate the tunnel information provided by the VPN
   Configuration server, before provisioning the tunnels.

5. Protocol choices and features

   Some candidate protocols that could be used for CE auto-configuration
   and the extensions that are required are identified here. A
   combination of these approaches may also be considered.

5.1 SNMP

   It is not recommended that an operator configure CEs directly via



Expires January 2003                                            [Page 5]





Internet Draft            CE Auto-Configuration                July 2002


   SNMP, as this is labour intensive.

   A new auto-discovery framework is required on CEs and SNMP "manager"
   code which allows a CE to "get" VPN service parameters (a defined IP
   VPN MIB) from a VPN Configuration server is required to be
   implemented on a CE.  Normally a Network Element (NE) has an SNMP
   "agent" which allows a Network Manager to "get" MIB objects from the
   NE.  If it is not feasbible for a CE to "get" VPN parameters, the VPN
   Configuration server may have to send SNMP traps to the CE to trigger
   the CE to do a "get" VPN parameters from the VPN Configuration
   server.

   An new auto update framework is required on a Network/VPN Service
   Provisioning Manager. SNMPv3 may be used to automatically update CEs.
   SNMPv1/v2 over IPSec may used to configure CE, but this cannot
   prevent a customer from tampering with a CE.

5.2 LDAP/DNS

   A CE could retrieve tunnel endpoint information (to add new tunnels)
   from a (DNS or LDAP) server, and may be located in a different
   provider's network. However, a provider is not able to inform a CE to
   explicitly teardown a tunnel to a site unless the CE poll the DNS or
   LDAP server for VPN update information or a message is sent from
   another server using a different protocol to trigger the CE to pull
   information from the DNS or LDAP server.

   If another messaging/protocol is required to inform a CE to remove a
   tunnel endpoint, that same protocol could be used to inform a CE to
   add a tunnel endpoint, instead of LDAP/DNS, i.e. the use of LDAP/DNS
   for CE auto-configuration would be redundant then.

5.3 IKE

   When a CE attempts to setup tunnel to a remote CE (which may be
   located in a different provider's network), the remote CE is
   implicitly being informed of the tunnel endpoint. The remote CE may
   still need to contact the VPN Configuration Server (using another
   protocol) to download other tunnel endpoint information.  This
   implies a provider is not able to explicitly teardown a tunnel to a
   site, unless a message is sent from  a server using another protocol,
   as in the LDAP/DNS approach.

5.4 COPS

   COPS allows a CE to retrieve tunnel endpoint information as well as
   to be updated of tunnel endpoint information from a PDP (a server).
   CEs may be located in different providers' network and SSL/TLS may be

Internet Draft            CE Auto-Configuration                July 2002


   leveraged to provide secure commnunication between CEs and the VPN
   Configuration Server.

   The PDP (Policy Decision Point) must maintain a large number of TCP
   sessions if there are a large number of CEs.

5.5 XML and HTTP/HTTPS

   May require another auto-discovery and update protocol, on top of
   http/https, unless the "gets/sets" are simple and the outcome of a
   "get/set" is either a success or failure. May require an auto-
   discovery and update framework on the CE and the VPN Configuration
   Server.

5.6 DHCP

   Auto-discovery and auto-update framework already exist on DHCP client
   and server.  Automate CE address association with CEs of a VPN and
   faciliate CE address management and reuse.  Lightweight when CEs of a
   VPN are within a provider network.

   In the case where CEs span inter-domain networks and hence the
   network access configuration process may not be leveraged, an
   approach where a front-end Authentication Server [See PIC, XAUTH] is
   used to authenticate CEs in another provider's network and request
   VPN information from a back-end server (e.g. a RADIUS server or DHCP
   Server), may be required.  The CEs in another provider's domain
   cannot be updated with new VPN information, unless the back-end
   server is able to provide VPN information update to the front-end
   Authentication Server, and the front-end Authentication Server is
   able to inform CEs of the VPN information change.

   This approach is discussed in the Appendix.

5.7 RADIUS

   This allows a provider to leverage existing AAA framework for IP VPN.
   Currently this approach does not allow a server to update CEs of VPN
   information.  This approach is discussed in the Appendix.

6. Conclusion

   To facilitate CE auto-configuration, the following alternatives may
   be considered:

   a) specify the MIB required for CE auto-configuration.  This MIB may
   be part of the IP VPN MIB for CEs, which can be used to perform
   remote manual provisioning of other parameters that do not require

   auto-configuration, as well.  Vendors may build proprietary auto-
   configuration framework independently and configure the MIB objects
   on CEs via SNMP.

   b) specify the tunnel information to be carried in a suitable
   protocol, which ideally should meet the requirements of CE auto-
   configuration and allows existing network device configuration
   framework to be leveraged for CE auto-configuration

1. Overview of CE Auto-configuration solutions

   A CE shall be automatically configured with an IP address to allow it
   to communicate with the provider's network.

   Different protocols (depending on the network access method and VPN
   service deployment requirements) which allow CEs to discover and/or
   be updated with VPN service information are described here.

   Both the automatic configuration of IP address on the CE and
   provisioning of services on the CE should be authenticated to prevent
   malicious users from tampering with CE configuration.

2. Auto-configuration of IP address of CE

   If a CE is located in the VPN service provider's network (also the
   network provider in this case), a CE may use DHCP to automatically
   obtain and configure its IP address (facing a provider's network).
   Otherwise the CE IP address is assigned by the CE's network provider,
   and VPN service provider must be informed of the CE IP address
   offline, or when a CE contact the VPN Configuration Server as
   described in later sections.

   The CE shall obtain an IP address from a DHCP server using the
   procedures defined in [DHCP].  The DHCP server and CE shall be
   configured with a shared key a priori.  The CE and the DHCP server
   shall use the Delayed Authentication protocol defined in [DHCP-AUTH]
   (instead of Configuration Token).

   A CE should authenticate a DHCP server to ensure the DHCP server is
   the provider's DHCP server and not a rogue server.  A DHCP server
   should authenticate the CE to ensure the CE is a legitimate DHCP
   client.

   No changes to [DHCP] and [DHCP-AUTH] are required during the auto-
   configuration of IP address of CE as described above.

3. Auto-configuration of VPN service - leveraging DHCP

Internet Draft            CE Auto-Configuration                July 2002


   Once the CE has obtained an IP address, the CE shall send DHCPINFORM
   directly to the DHCP server to solicit for other configuration
   information. The DHCP server shall respond with a DHCPACK and the
   following VPN related DHCP option(s).

   If a VPN site is removed or added (or the CEs must be updated with
   new VPN configuration information), the DHCP server may send DHCP
   FORCERENEW to the CEs belonging to the VPN. The CEs shall send
   DHCPINFORM as described in the previous paragraph to obtain new VPN
   site information.

   This section lists the new DHCP option(s) required.

3.1 Peer CE DHCP Option

   The Peer CE option specifies the VPN ID (a unique number identifying
   a VPN or VPL within a service provider's network) and a list of Peer
   CE(s) which the client may connect to. The CE should setup a tunnel
   to every Peer CE listed.

   The code for this option is to be assigned by IANA. The minimum
   length for this option is 4 octet, and the length MUST always be a
   multiple of The VPN ID is 4 octet and the CE addresses are IPv4
   addresses.  The Reserved field is 1 octet - the 1 "O"peration bit to
   indicate if these are additional CEs to be added or deleted, if the
   "A" bit is set to 1 or to 0, respectively.

      +-----+-----+------+--------+-+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----

4. Auto-configuration of VPN service - leveraging PPP

   If a CE is connected to a provider's network via PPP, the remote CE
   addresses of a VPN may be configured via the IPCP Configuration
   Options which allow negotiatiation of desirable Internet Protocol
   parameters.

   The most up-to-date values of the IPCP Option Type field are
   specified in the most recent "Assigned Numbers" RFC [6].  A new TBD
   IPCP option can be used to configure remote CE addresses of a VPN if
   a CE is connected to the provider's network via PPP.  However this
   requires NAS (Network Access Servers) to support this new IPCP
   option. A forward looking extension may be to define an opaque IPCP
   option to allow some configuration options to be relayed to or from a
   back-end server transparently.

Internet Draft            CE Auto-Configuration                July 2002


5. Auto-configuration of VPN service - using a VPN Configuration server
   approach

   The CE should be configured a priori with the name or address of the
   VPN Configuration server.  This MAY be accomplished by pre-
   configuring a CE before it is being deployed or alternatively the VPN
   Configuration server address MAY be obtained from a DHCP server via a
   new DHCP option (if the CE is within the provider's network).

   The CE must be pre-configured with the CE's private key and digital
   certificate pair or the CE Identification and password (if [PIC,
   XAUTH] is used), and the provider's Certificate Authority (CA) and
   the CA's public key or the VPN Configuration Server's public key.
   This allows a CE to authenticate the VPN Configuration Server and the
   CE to be authenticated by the VPN Configuration Server (or relayed to
   an authentication server via the VPN Configuration Server)

   The CE should then be able to contact the VPN Configuration server.
   VPN configuration parameters may be solicited from a VPN
   Configuration server. If [PIC, XAUTH] is used to contact an
   Authentication Server (aka the VPN Configuration Server in this
   document), a new ISAKMP payload to carry a VPN Information request
   can be defined to allow the CE to request VPN Information via the
   Authentication Server.  The VPN Information request should be sent
   after the CE has been authenticated.  The front-end Authentication
   Server (aka VPN Configuration Server here) may request the VPN
   Information from a back-end legacy server e.g. RADIUS.  See [PIC] for
   the rationale on using a front-end and back-end server.

5.1 Default VPN Configuration server DHCP Option (Optional)

   This feature may be useful if a CE network access is managed by the
   VPN service provider as well.  The new DHCP option required is the
   VPN Configuration server option.

   The VPN Configuration server option specifies a list of servers
   available to  the client. VPN Configuration server should be listed
   in order of preference.

   The code for this option is TBD.  The minimum length for this option
   is 4 octets, and the length MUST always be a multiple of 4.
       Code   Len         Address 1               Address 2
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
      | TBD |  n  |  a1 |  a2 |  a3 |  a4 |  a1 |  a2 |  ...
      +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--

6. Security Considerations for DHCP

Internet Draft            CE Auto-Configuration                July 2002


   The addition of DHCP option(s) for VPN auto-configuration does not
   affect the security of DHCP.  The security issues of DHCP are
   described in [DHCP-AUTH] and as it pertains to the auto-configuration
   of CEs, the security issues are described in this draft.

   If an unauthorised CE configure its own IP address, the CE may not be
   permitted to use any services unless the CE has been authenticated
   for the particular service. For e.g. a device or the default filter
   at the ingress to the network can be configured to discard all
   traffic except DHCP messages from the client (port 67) unless the
   client has been authenticated for services as described in Section 3.
   In addition all DHCP messages on port 68 from the client should be
   discarded (a network user should not be sending DHCP messages from a
   DHCP server into the provider's network).  This measure which is
   applicable to Section 3, does not prevent a malicious user from
   launching a DoS attack on DHCP servers in the provider's network.
   [Note: If Layer 2 authentication is available, (e.g. 802.1x), it may
   be used to provide authenticated access to the Layer 2 network. In
   this case, unauthorised users are not allowed to send traffic].

   To reduce DoS attacks, the DHCP server may choose to "quarantine" CEs
   which have exceeded the pre-defined number of communication attempts
   allowed with the DHCP server within a given period.  Subsequent
   messages from these CEs may be discarded.  If these measures are
   necessary, the text in DHCP-AUTH would need to be modified
   accordingly.
