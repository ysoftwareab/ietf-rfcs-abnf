<h1><br />ConEx Concepts and Use Cases<br />draft-moncaster-conex-concepts-uses-01</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p> Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are facing problems where localized congestion
	prevents full utilization of the path between sender and receiver at today's
	"broadband" speeds. ISPs desire to control this congestion, which often appears
	to be caused by a small number of users consuming a large amount of bandwidth.
	Building out more capacity along all of the path to handle this congestion can
	be expensive and may not result in improvements for all users so
	network operators have sought other ways to manage congestion.
	The current mechanisms all suffer from difficulty measuring the congestion (as
	distinguished from the total traffic). 
</p>
<p> The ConEx Working Group is designing a mechanism to make congestion along any
	path visible at the Internet Layer. This document describes example cases where 
	this mechanism would be useful.

Introduction</h3>

<p> The growth of "always on" broadband connections, coupled with the steady
	increase in access speeds <a class='info' href='#OfCom'>[OfCom]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ofcom: Office of Communications, &ldquo;UK Broadband Speeds 2008: Research report,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>, have caused unforeseen problems for
	network operators and users alike. Users are increasingly seeing congestion at peak times and 
	changes in usage patterns (with the growth of real-time streaming) simply serve
	to exacerbate this. Operators want all their users to see a good service but are
	unable to see where congestion problems originate. But congestion results from sharing network
	capacity with others, not merely from using it. In general, today's "DSL"
	and cable-internet users cannot "cause" congestion in the absence of
	competing traffic. (Wireless ISPs and cellular internet have different
	tradeoffs which we will not discuss here.) 
</p>
<p> Congestion generally results from the interaction of traffic from
	an ISPs own subscribers with traffic from other users. The tools currently
	available don't allow an operator to identify which traffic contributes most to the congestion
	and so they are powerless to properly control it. 
</p>
<p> While building out more capacity to handle increased traffic is always
	good, the expense and lead-time can be prohibitive, especially for network
	operators that charge flat-rate feeds to subscribers and are thus unable
	to charge heavier users more for causing more congestion <a class='info' href='#BB-incentive'>[BB&#8209;incentive]<span> (</span><span class='info'>MIT Communications Futures Program (CFP) and Cambridge University Communications Research Network, &ldquo;The Broadband Incentive Problem,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>. For an operator
	facing congestion caused by other operators' networks, building out its
	own capacity is unlikely to solve the congestion problem. Operators are
	thus facing increased pressure to find effective solutions to dealing
	with the increasing bandwidth demands of all users. 
</p>
<p> The growth of "scavenger" behaviour (e.g. <a class='info' href='#LEDBAT'>[LEDBAT]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shalunov, S., &ldquo;Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>) helps to reduce congestion,
	but can actually make the ISPs problem less tractable. These 
	users are trying to make good use of the capacity of the path while minimising their own costs. Thus, users of such
	services may show very heavy total traffic up until the moment congestion
	is detected (at the Transport Layer), but then will immediately back off. ISP
	monitoring (at the Internet Layer) cannot detect this congestion avoidance
	if the congestion in question is in a different domain further along the
	path; and must treat such users as congestion-causing users. 
</p>
<p>The ConEx working group proposes that Internet Protocol (IP) packets have two "congestion"
	fields. The exact protocol details of these fields are for another
	document, but we expect them to provide measures of "congestion so far"
	and "congestion still expected".

Definitions</h3>

<p> ConEx expects to build on Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
	<a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> where it is available. Hence we use the 
	term "congestion" in a manner consistent with ECN, namely that congestion 
	occurs before any packet is	dropped. In this section we define a number
	of terms that are used throughout the document.

	</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Congestion:</dt>
<dd> Congestion is a measure of the probability that a
	    given packet will be ECN-marked or dropped as it traverses the network.
	    At any given router it is a function of the queue state at that router.
	    Congestion is added in a combinatorial manner, that is, routers ignore
	    the congestion a packet has already seen when they decide whether to
	    mark it or not. 
</dd>
<dt>Congestion Volume:</dt>
<dd>  Congestion volume is defined 
		as the congestion a packet experiences, multiplied by the size of that packet. 
		It can be expressed as the volume of bytes that have been ECN-marked or dropped.
		By extension, the Congestion Rate would be the 
	    transmission rate multiplied by the congestion level.
</dd>
<dt>Upstream Congestion:</dt>
<dd> The congestion that has already been
	    experienced by a packet as it travels along its path. In other words at 
		any point on the path, it is the congestion between the source of the
	    packet and that point. 
</dd>
<dt>Downstream Congestion:</dt>
<dd> The congestion that a packet still
	    has to experience on the remainder of its path. In other words at any
	    point it is the congestion still to be experienced as the packet
	    travels between that point and its destination.
</dd>
<dt>Whole Path Congestion:</dt>
<dd> The total congestion that a packet experiences
	between the ingress to the network and the egress.
</dd>
<dt>Network Ingress:</dt>
<dd> The Network Ingress is the first node a
	    packet traverses that is outside the source's own network. In a domestic network

Existing Approaches to Congestion Management</h3>

<p>A number of ISPs already use some form of traffic management. Generally
    this is an attempt to control the peak-time congestion within their network
	and to better apportion shared network resources between customers. Even ISPs
	that don't impose such traffic management (such as those in Germany) may have
	caps on the capacity they allow for Best Effort traffic in their backhaul.
</p>
<p>
	These attempts to control congestion have usually focused on
	the peak hours and aim to rate limit heavy users during that time. For
	example, users who have consumed a certain amount of bandwidth during the
	last 24 hours may be elected to have their traffic shaped once the
	total traffic reaches a given level in certain nodes
	within the operator's network. 
</p>
<p>The authors have chosen not to exhaustively list current approaches to congestion management. 
	Broadly these approaches can be divided into those that happen at Layer 3 of the OSI model and
	those that use information gathered from higher layers. In general these approaches
	attempt to find a "proxy" measure for congestion. Layer 3 approaches include:
	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Volume accounting &mdash; the overall volume of traffic a given user or network sends
		is measured. Users may be subject to an absolute volume cap (e.g. 10Gbytes per month) or 
		the "heaviest" users may be sanctioned in some manner.
</li>
<li>Rate measurement &mdash; the traffic rate per user or per network can be measured. The 
		absolute rate a given user sends at may be limited at peak hours or the average rate
		may be used as the basis for inter-network billing. 
</li>
</ul><p>
	Higher layer approaches include:
	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Bottleneck rate policing &mdash; bottleneck flow rate policers aim to share the available
		capacity at a given bottleneck between all concurrent users.
</li>
<li>DPI and application rate policing &mdash; deep packet inspection and other techniques can 
		be used to determine what application a given traffic flow is associated with. ISPs may
		then use this information to rate-limit or otherwise sanction certain applications at peak hours.
</li>
</ul><p>
	
</p>
<p>All of these current approaches suffer from some general limitations. First,
	they introduce performance uncertainty. Flat-rate pricing plans are popular
	because users appreciate the certainty of having their monthly bill amount
	remain the same for each billing period, allowing them to plan their costs
	accordingly. But while flat-rate pricing avoids billing uncertainty, it
	creates performance uncertainty: users cannot know whether the performance
	of their connection is being altered or degraded based on how the network
	operator manages congestion. 
</p>
<p>Second, none of the approaches is able to make use of what may be the most
	important factor in managing congestion: the amount that a given endpoint
	contributes to congestion on the network. This information simply is not
	available to network nodes, and neither volume nor rate nor application
	usage is an adequate proxy for congestion volume, because none of these
	metrics measures a user or network's actual contribution to congestion on
	the network. 
</p>
<p> Finally, none of these solutions accounts for inter-network congestion.
	Mechanisms may exist that allow an operator to identify and mitigate
	congestion in their own network, but the design of the Internet means that
	only the end-hosts have full visibility of congestion information along the
	whole path. ConEx allows this information to be visible to everyone on the
	path and thus allows operators to make better-informed decisions about
	controlling traffic.

<a name="rfc.section.4"></a><h3>4.&nbsp;
Exposing Congestion</h3>

<p> We argue that current traffic-control mechanisms seek to control the
	wrong quantity. What matters in the network is neither the volume of
	traffic nor the rate of traffic: it is the contribution to congestion over
	time&nbsp;&mdash; congestion means that your traffic impacts other users,
	and conversely that their traffic impacts you. So if there is no congestion
	there need not be any restriction on the amount a user can send;
	restrictions only need to apply when others are sending traffic such that
	there is congestion. 
</p>
<p> For example, an application intending to transfer large amounts of data
	could use a congestion control mechanism like <a class='info' href='#LEDBAT'>[LEDBAT]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Shalunov, S., &ldquo;Low Extra Delay Background Transport (LEDBAT),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>
	to reduce its transmission rate before any competing TCP flows do, by
	detecting an increase in end-to-end delay (as a measure of impending
	congestion). However such techniques rely on voluntary, altruistic action
	by end users and their application providers. ISPs can neither enforce
	their use nor avoid penalizing them for congestion they avoid. 
</p>
<p> The Internet was designed so that end-hosts detect and control congestion.
	We argue that congestion needs to be visible to network nodes as well, not
	just to the end hosts. More specifically, a network needs to be able to
	measure how much congestion any particular traffic expects to cause between
	the monitoring point in the network and the destination ("rest-of-path
	congestion"). This would be a new capability. Today a network can use
	Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> to
	detect how much congestion the traffic has suffered between the source and
	a monitoring point, but not beyond. This new capability would enable an
	ISP to give incentives for the use of LEDBAT-like applications that seek to 
	minimise congestion in the network whilst restricting inappropriate uses 
	of traditional TCP and UDP applications. 
</p>
<p> So we propose a new approach which we call Congestion Exposure. We
	propose that congestion information should be made visible at the IP
	layer, so that any network node can measure the contribution to congestion
	of an aggregate of traffic as easily as straight volume can be measured
	today. Once the information is exposed in this way, it is then
	possible to use it to measure the true impact of any traffic on the
	network. 
</p>
<p> In general, congestion exposure gives ISPs a principled way to hold their
	customers accountable for the impact on others of their network usage and
	reward them for choosing congestion-sensitive applications.

ECN - a Step in the Right Direction</h3>

<p> Explicit Congestion Notification <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> allows
		routers to explicitly tell end-hosts that they are approaching the point of
		congestion. ECN builds on Active Queue Mechanisms such as random early
		discard (RED) <a class='info' href='#RFC2309'>[RFC2309]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, B., Clark, D., Crowcroft, J., Davie, B., Deering, S., Estrin, D., Floyd, S., Jacobson, V., Minshall, G., Partridge, C., Peterson, L., Ramakrishnan, K., Shenker, S., Wroclawski, J., and L. Zhang, &ldquo;Recommendations on Queue Management and Congestion Avoidance in the Internet,&rdquo; April&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> by allowing the router to mark
		a packet with a Congestion Experienced (CE) codepoint, rather than dropping
		it. The probability of a packet being marked increases with the length of
		the queue and thus the rate of CE marks is a guide to the level of congestion
		at that queue. This CE codepoint travels forward through the network to the
		receiver which then informs the sender that it has seen congestion. The
		sender is then required to respond as if it had experienced a packet loss.
		Because the CE codepoint is visible in the IP layer, this approach reveals
		the upstream congestion level for a packet.
</p>
<p> Alas, this is not enough - ECN gives downstream nodes an idea of the
		congestion so far for any flow. This can help hold a receiver accountable for
		the congestion caused by incoming traffic. But a receiver can only indirectly
		influence incoming congestion, by politely asking the sender to control it. A
		receiver cannot make a sender install an adaptive codec, or install LEDBAT
		instead of TCP congestion-control. And a receiver cannot cause an attacker to
		stop flooding it with traffic. 
</p>
<p> What is needed is knowledge of the downstream congestion level, for which
		you need additional information that is still concealed from the network.

Requirements for ConEx</h3>

<p>This document is intended to highlight some of the possible uses for
	a congestion exposure mechanism such as the one being proposed by the ConEx working group.
	The actual ConEx mechanism will be defined in another document.
</p>
<p>
	In this section we set out some basic requirements for any ConEx mechanism.
	We are not saying this is an exhaustive list of those requirements. This list
	is simply to allow readers to make a realistic assessment of the feasibility and
	utility of the use cases set out in <a class='info' href='#conex-uses-cases'>Section&nbsp;8<span> (</span><span class='info'>ConEx Use Cases</span><span>)</span></a>.
	
</p>
<p>
	The three key requirements are
	</p>
<ol class="text">
<li> Timeliness of information. The limitations of current network design gives a
		minimum delay of 1 round trip time (RTT) for congestion information to circulate the 
		network. It is important that the conex mechanism operates on similar timescales to ensure 
		the congestion information it exposes is as up to date as possible. Stale congestion
		information is useless since congestion levels can fluctuate widely over relatively short timescales.
</li>
<li>Accuracy of information. In order to be useful, congestion information has to be
		sufficiently accurate for the purposes for which it is to be used. In general the main purposes
		are monitoring congestion and controlling congestion. As a minimum, conex
		should equal the accuracy required for current TCP implementations. A unary
		signal such as that provided by ECN is sufficient though a more precise signal may be desirable. 
</li>
<li>Visibility of information. In order to be useful conex information should be visible at 
		every point in the network. In today's networks that means it must be visible at the IP layer.
		
</li>

ConEx Issues</h3>

<p> If ConEx information is to be useful, it has to be accurate (within the
		limitations of the available feedback). This raises three issues that need to be
		addressed:

		</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>Distinguishing ConEx traffic from non-ConEx traffic:</dt>
<dd>
			An ISP may reasonably choose to do nothing different with ConEx traffic. 
			Alternatively they might want to incentivise it in order to give it marginally better
			service. 
</dd>
<dt>Over-declaring congestion:</dt>
<dd> 
			ConEx relies on the sender accurately declaring the congestion they expect to
			see. During TCP slow-start a sender is unable to predict the level of congestion
			they will experience and it is advisable to declare that expect to see some
			congestion on the first packet. However it is important to be cautious when
			over-declaring congestion lest you erode trust in the system. We do not initially 
			propose any mechanism to deal with this issue. 
</dd>
<dt>Under-declaring congestion:</dt>
<dd> 
			ConEx requires the sender to set the downstream congestion field in each packet 
			to their best estimate of what they expect the whole path congestion to be. If
			this expected congestion level is to be used for traffic management (see use
			cases) then it benefits the user to under-declare. Mechanisms are needed to
			prevent this happening. 
</dd>
<dt></dt>
<dd> There are three approaches that may work (individually or in combination):
			
<ul class="text">
<li> An ingress router can monitor a user's feedback to see what their reported
				congestion level actually is. 
</li>
<li> If the congestion field carries the actual congestion value then a ConEx-Enabled Policer
				could potentially drop any packet with a downstream-congestion value
				of zero or less. 
</li>
<li> An egress router can actively monitor some or all flows to check that they
				are complying with the requirement that the downstream congestion value should
				be zero or (slightly positive) when it reaches the egress. 
</li>

A Possible Congestion Exposure Mechanism</h3>

<p> One possible protocol is based on a concept known as re-feedback

	management techniques like RED <a class='info' href='#RFC2309'>[RFC2309]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, B., Clark, D., Crowcroft, J., Davie, B., Deering, S., Estrin, D., Floyd, S., Jacobson, V., Minshall, G., Partridge, C., Peterson, L., Ramakrishnan, K., Shenker, S., Wroclawski, J., and L. Zhang, &ldquo;Recommendations on Queue Management and Congestion Avoidance in the Internet,&rdquo; April&nbsp;1998.</span><span>)</span></a> and ECN
	<a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a> that network elements can already use to
	measure and expose congestion. The protocol is described in more detail in
	<a class='info' href='#Fairer-faster'>[Fairer&#8209;faster]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Briscoe, B., &ldquo;A Fairer Faster Internet Protocol,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, but we summarise it below.
</p>
<p> In this protocol packets have two Congestion fields in their IP header:

	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li> An Upstream Congestion field to record the congestion already experienced
		along the path. Routers indicate their current congestion level by
		updating this field in every packet. As the packet traverses the network
		it builds up a record of the overall congestion along its path in this
		field. This data is sent back to the sender who uses it to determine its
		transmission rate. This can be achieved by using the existing ECN field
		<a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>.
		
</li>
<li> A whole-path congestion field that uses re-feedback to record the total
		congestion expected along the path. The sender does this by re-inserting
		the current Congestion level for the path into this field for every packet
		it transmits. 
</li>
</ul><p>

	Thus at any node downstream of the sender you can see the Upstream
	Congestion for the packet and the whole path congestion (with a time lag of 
	one round-trip-time (RTT)) and can calculate the Downstream Congestion by 
	subtracting the Upstream from the Whole Path Congestion. 
</p>
<p> So congestion exposure can be achieved by coupling congestion notification
	from routers with the re-insertion of this information by the sender. This
	establishes information symmetry between users and network providers.

ConEx Architectural Elements</h3>

<p> ConEx is a simple concept that has revolutionary implications. It is that rare
	thing&nbsp;&mdash; a truly disruptive technology, and as such it is hard to
	imagine the variety of uses it may be put to. Before even thinking what it might be used
	for we need to address the issue of how it can be used. This section describes
	four architectural elements that can be placed in the network and which utilise
	ConEx information to monitor or control traffic flows.
		 
</p>
<p> In the following we are assuming the most abstract version of the
	ConEx mechanism, namely that every packet carries two congestion fields, one for
	upstream congestion and one for downstream. <a class='info' href='#conex-uses-mechanism'>Section&nbsp;6<span> (</span><span class='info'>A Possible Congestion Exposure Mechanism</span><span>)</span></a> 
	outlines one possible approach for this.

ConEx Monitoring</h3>

<p> One of the most useful things ConEx provides is the ability to monitor (and control) the
	amount of congestion entering or leaving a network. With ConEx, each packet carries
	sufficient information to work out the Upstream, Downstream and Total Congestion Volume
	that packet is responsible for.	This allows the overall Congestion Volume to be calculated at any point in the network.
	In effect this gives a measure of how much excess traffic has been sent that was above the instantaneous 
	transmission capacity of the network. A 1 Gbps router that is 0.1% congested 
	implies that there is 1 Mbps of excess traffic at that point in time.
</p>
<p>
	The figure below shows 2 conceptual pieces of network equipment that utilise ConEx
	information in order to monitor the flow of congestion through the network. The Border
	Monitor sits at the border between two networks, while the Edge Monitor sits at the ingress 
	or egress to the Internetwork.

			At any border between 2 networks, the operator can see the total Congestion Volume 
			that is	being forwarded into its network by the neighbouring network. A Border Monitor
			is able to measure the bulk congestion markings and establish the flow of Congestion 
			Volume each way across the border.  This could be used as the basis	for inter-network 
			settlements. It also provides information to target upgrades to where they are actually 
			needed and might help to identify network problems. Border Monitoring really needs the 
			majority of the network to be ECN-Enabled in order to provide the necessary Upstream 
			Congestion signal. Clearly the greatest benefit comes when there is also ConEx deployment 
			in the nnetwork. However, as long as the sender is sending accurate ConEx information 
			and the majority of the network is ECN-enabled,	border monitoring will work.

ConEx Policing</h3>

<p>As shown above, ConEx gives an easy method of measuring Congestion Volume. This information
		can be used as a control metric for making traffic management decisions (such as deciding which 
		traffic to prioritise) or to identify and block sources of persistent and damaging congestion.
		Simple policer mechanisms, such as those described 
		in <a class='info' href='#Policing-freedom'>[Policing&#8209;freedom]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Briscoe, B., Jacquet, A., and T. Moncaster, &ldquo;Policing Freedom to Use the Internet Resource Pool,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> and <a class='info' href='#re-ecn-motive'>[re&#8209;ecn&#8209;motive]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Briscoe, B., Jacquet, A., Moncaster, T., and A. Smith, &ldquo;Re-ECN: A Framework for adding Congestion Accountability to TCP/IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>,
		can control the overall congestion volume traversing a network. Ingress Policing typically 
		happens at the Ingress Node, Egress Policing typically happens at the Egress Node and Border
		Policing can happen at any border between two networks. The current charter concentrates on 
		use cases employing Egress Policers.

<p>	
			An Egress Policer allows an ISP to monitor the Congestion Volume a user's traffic has caused throughout
			the network, and then use this to prioritise the traffic accordingly. By itself, such a policer cannot 
			tell how much of this congestion was caused in the ISP's own network, but it will identify which users are 
			the "heaviest" in terms of the congestion they have caused. Assuming the ConEx information is accurate
			then the Egress Policer will be able to see how much congestion exists between it and the final destination 
			(what you might call "last-mile" congestion). There are a number of strategies that could be used to determine
			how traffic is treated by an Egress Policer. Obviously traffic that is not ConEx enabled needs to receive some 
			form of "default" treatment. Traffic that is ConEx enabled may have under-declared congestion in which case it 
			would be reasonable to give it a low scheduling priority. Traffic that appears to be over-declaring congestion
			may be simply a result of especially high "last-mile" congestion, in which case the ISP may want to upgrade the 
			access capacity, or may want to try and reduce the volume of traffic. Where the ISP knows what the "last-mile" 
			congestion is (for instance if it is able to measure several users sharing that same capacity) then any remaining
			over-declared congestion might be seen as a signal that the sender wishes to prioritise this traffic.

ConEx as a basis for traffic management</h3>

<p> Currently many ISPs impose some form of traffic management at peak hours. This
	  is a simple economic necessity&nbsp;&mdash; the only reason the Internet works
	  as a commercial concern is that ISPs are able to rely on statistical multiplexing
	  to share their expensive core network between large numbers of customers. In order
	  to ensure all customers get some chance to access the network, the "heaviest"
	  customers will be subjected to some form of traffic management at peak times
	  (typically a rate cap for certain types of traffic) <a class='info' href='#Fair-use'>[Fair&#8209;use]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Broadband Choices, &ldquo;Truth about 'fair usage' broadband,&rdquo; 2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. Often this traffic
	  management is done with expensive flow aware devices such as DPI boxes or flow-aware
	  routers. 
</p>
<p> ConEx offers a better approach that will actually target the users that are causing the congestion.
	By using Ingress or Egress Policers, an ISP can identify which users are causing the greatest Congestion
	Volume throughout the network. This can then be used as the basis for traffic management decisions. The
	Ingress Policer described in <a class='info' href='#Policing-freedom'>[Policing&#8209;freedom]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Briscoe, B., Jacquet, A., and T. Moncaster, &ldquo;Policing Freedom to Use the Internet Resource Pool,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> is one interesting approach
	that gives the user a congestion volume limit. So long as they stay within their limit then their
	traffic is unaffected. Once they exceed that limit then their traffic will be blocked temporarily.

ConEx to incentivise scavenger transports</h3>

<p> Recent work proposes a new approach for QoS where traffic is provided with a less
	  than best effort or "scavenger" quality of service. The idea is that low priority
	  but high volume traffic such as OS updates, P2P file transfers and view-later TV
	  programs should be allowed to use any spare network capacity, but should rapidly
	  get out of the way if a higher priority or interactive application starts up.
	  One solution being actively explored is LEDBAT which proposes a new congestion
	  control algorithm that is less aggressive in seeking out bandwidth than TCP. 
</p>
<p> At present most ISPs assume a strong correlation between the volume of a flow
	  and the impact that flow causes in the network. This assumption has been eroded
	  by the growth of interactive streaming which behaves in an inelastic manner and hence
	  can cause high congestion at relatively low data volumes. Currently LEDBAT-like transports
	  get no incentive from the ISP since they still transfer large volumes of data and may
	  reach high transfer speeds if the network is uncongested. Consequently the only current
	  incentive for LEDBAT is that it can reduce self-congestion effects.
</p>
<p> If the ISP has deployed a ConEx-aware ingress policer then they are able to
	  incentivise the use of LEDBAT because a user will be policed according to the
	  overall congestion volume their traffic generates, not the rate or data volume. If all background file
	  transfers are only generating a low level of congestion, then the sender has
	  more "congestion budget" to "spend" on their interactive applications. It can
	  be shown <a class='info' href='#Kelly'>[Kelly]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kelly, F., Maulloo, A., and D. Tan, &ldquo;Rate control for communication networks: shadow prices, proportional fairness and stability,&rdquo; 1998.</span><span>)</span></a> that this approach improves social welfare&nbsp;&mdash; in
	  other words if you limit the congestion that all users can generate then
 	  everyone benefits from a better service.

ConEx to mitigate DDoS</h3>

<p> DDoS relies on subverting innocent end users and getting them to send flood
	  traffic to a given destination. This is intended to cause a rapid increase in
	  congestion in the immediate vicinity of that destination. If it fails to do this
	  then it can't be called Denial of Service. If the ingress ISP has deployed Ingress Policers,
	  that ISP will effectively limit how much DDoS traffic enters the 'net. If any ISP along the path has
	  deployed Border Monitors then they will be able to detect a sharp rise in Congestion Volume and if
	  they have Border Policers they will be able to "turn off" this traffic. If 
	  the victim of the DDoS attack is behind an Egress Monitor then their ISP will be able to detect 
	  which traffic is causing problems. If the
	  compromised user tries to use the 'net during the DDoS attack, they will quickly 
	  become aware that something is wrong, and their ISP can show the evidence that
	  their computer has become zombified. 
</p>
<p>
		DDoS is a genuine problem and so far there is no perfect solution. ConEx does
		serve to raise the bar somewhat and can avoid the need for some of the more
		draconian measures that are currently used to control DDoS. More details of this
		can be found in <a class='info' href='#Malice'>[Malice]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Briscoe, B., &ldquo;Using Self Interest to Prevent Malice; Fixing the Denial of Service Flaw of the Internet,&rdquo; 2006.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Accounting for Congestion Volume</h3>

<p>
		Accountability was one of the original design goals for the Internet <a class='info' href='#Design-Philosophy'>[Design&#8209;Philosophy]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Clarke, D., &ldquo;The Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols,&rdquo; 1988.</span><span>)</span></a>. At
		the time it was ranked low because the network was non-commercial and it was assumed
		users had the best interests of the network at heart. Nowadays users generally treat the 
		network as a commodity and the Internet has become highly commercialised. This 
		causes problems for ISPs and others	which they have tried to solve and often leads to a 
		tragedy of the commons where users end up fighting each other for scarce peak capacity.
</p>
<p>The most elegant
		solution would be to introduce an Internet-wide system of accountability where every actor in 
		the network is held to account for the impact they have on others. If  
		Policers are placed at every Network Ingress or Egress and Border Monitors at 
		every border, then you have the basis for a system of congestion accounting. Simply by
		controlling the overall Congestion Volume each end-system or stub-network can send you

ConEx as a form of differential QoS</h3>

<p> Most QoS approaches require the active participation of routers to control the
	  delay and loss characteristics for the traffic. For real-time interactive traffic
	  it is clear that low delay (and predictable jitter) are critical, and thus these probably
	  always need different treatment at a router. However if low loss is the issue
	  then ConEx offers an alternative approach.
</p>
<p>Assuming the ingress ISP has deployed a ConEx Ingress Policer, then the only control 
	  on a user's traffic is dependent on the congestion that user has caused. Likewise, if 
	  they are receiving traffic through a ConEx Egress Policer then their ISP will impose 
	  traffic controls (prioritisation, rate limiting, etc) based on the congestion they have caused.
	  If an end-user (be they the receiver or sender) wants to prioritise some
	  traffic over other traffic then they can allow that traffic to generate or cause more
	  congestion. The price they will pay will be to reduce the congestion that their other
	  traffic causes. 
</p>
<p> Streaming video content-delivery is a good candidate for such ConEx-mediated QoS. Such traffic
		can tolerate moderately high delays, but there are strong economic pressures to maintain
		a high enough data rate (as that will directly influence the Quality of Experience the 
		end-user receives. This approach removes the need for bandwidth brokers to establish QoS 
		sessions, by removing the need to coordinate requests from multiple sources to pre-allocate 
		bandwidth, as well as to coordinate which allocations to revoke when bandwidth predictions 
		turn out to be wrong. There is also no need to "rate-police" at the boundaries on a per-flow basis, 
		removing the need to keep per-flow state (which in turn makes this approach more scalable).

Partial vs. Full Deployment</h3>

<p>In a fully-deployed ConEx-enabled internet, <a class='info' href='#QoS-Models'>[QoS&#8209;Models]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Briscoe, B. and S. Rudkin, &ldquo;Commercial Models for IP Quality of Service Interconnect,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> shows that ISP settlements based on congestion 
	volume can allocate money to where upgrades are needed. Fully-deployed implies that ConEx-marked 
	packets which have not exhausted their expected congestion would go through a congested path 
	in preference to non-ConEx packets, with money changing hands to justify that priority.	
</p>
<p>In a partial deployment, routers that ignore ConEx markings and let them pass unaltered are no problem unless 
	they become congested and drop packets. Since ConEx incentivises the use of lower congestion
	transports, such congestion drops should anyway become rare events. ConEx-unaware routers that do 
	drop ConEx-marked packets would cause a problem so to minimise this risk ConEx should be designed such that ConEx packets will appear 
	valid to any node they traverse. Failing that it could be possible to bypass such nodes with a tunnel.
	  
</p>
<p>If any network is not ConEx enabled then the sender and receiver have to rely on ECN-marking or packet drops to
	 establish the congestion level. If the receiver isn't ConEx-enabled then there needs to be some
	form of compatibility mode. Even in such partial deployments the end-users and access networks will
	benefit from ConEx. This will put create incentives for ConEx to be more widely adopted as
	access networks put pressure on their backhaul providers to use congestion as the basis of their
	interconnect agreement.
	
</p>
<p>The actual charge per unit of congestion would be specified in an interconnection agreement,
	with economic pressure driving that charge downward to the cost to upgrade whenever alternative
	paths are available. That charge would most likely be invisible to the majority of users. Instead
	such users will have a contractual allowance to cause congestion, and would see packets dropped 
	when that allowance is depleted.
</p>
<p>  Once an Autonomous System (AS) agrees to pay any congestion charges to any other AS it forwards to, 
	it has an economic incentive to increase congestion-so-far marking for any congestion within its 
	network. Failure to do this quickly becomes a significant cost, giving it an incentive to turn on such marking. 
</p>
<p> End users (or the writers of the applications they use) will be given an incentive to use a congestion control
	that back off more aggressively than TCP for any elastic traffic. Indeed they will actually have an 
	incentive to use fully weighted congestion controls that allow traffic to cause congestion in proportion
	to its priority. Traffic which backs off more aggressively than TCP will see congestion charges remain 
	the same (or even drop) as congestion increases; traffic which backs off less aggressively will see charges 
	rise, but the user may be prepared to accept this if it is high-priority traffic; traffic which backs 
	off not at all will see charges rise dramatically.

Congestion as a Commercial Secret</h3>

<p>
	
	Network operators have long viewed the congestion levels in their 
	network as a business secret. In some ways this harks back to the days 
	of fixed-line telecommunications where congestion manifested as failed 
	connections or dropped calls. But even in modern data-centric packet 
	networks congestion is viewed as a secret not to be shared with 
	competitors. It can be debated whether this view is sensible, but it
	may make operators uneasy about deploying ConEx. The following two 
	examples highlight some of the arguments used:
	</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>An ISP buys backhaul capacity from an operator. Most ISPs want their
	customers to get a decent service and so they want the backhaul to be
	relatively uncongested. If there is competition, operators will seek
	to reassure their customers (the ISPs) that their network is not congested in
	order to attract their custom. Some operators may
	see ConEx as a threat since it will enable those ISPs to see the actual congestion
	in their network. On the other hand, operators with low congestion
	could use ConEx to show how well their network performs, and so might have
	an incentive to enable it.
</li>
<li>ISPs would like to be part of the lucrative content provision market. Currently 
	the ISP can gain a competitive edge as it can put its own content in a higher QoS class, 
	whereas traffic from content providers has to use the
	Best Effort class. The ISP may take the view that if they can conceal the congestion
	level in their Best Effort class this will make it harder for the content provider
	to maintain a good level of QoS. But in reality the Content Provider will just
	use the feedback mechanisms in streaming protocols such as Adobe Flash to monitor the
	congestion.
</li>
</ul><p>
	Of course some might say that the idea of keeping congestion secret is silly. After
	all, end-hosts already have knowledge of the congestion throughout the network, albeit only
	along specific paths, and ISPs can work out that there is persistent congestion as their
	customers will be suffering degraded network performance.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p> This document proposes a mechanism tagging onto Explicit Congestion Notification
        <a class='info' href='#RFC3168'>[RFC3168]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ramakrishnan, K., Floyd, S., and D. Black, &ldquo;The Addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>, and inherits the security issues listed therein. The
        additional issues from ConEx markings relate to the degree of trust
        each forwarding point places in the ConEx markings it receives, which is
        a business decision mostly orthogonal to the markings themselves. 
</p>
<p> One expected use of exposed congestion information is to hold the end-to-end
	transport and the network accountable to each other. The network cannot be relied
	on to report information to the receiver against its interest, and the same applies
	for the information the receiver feeds back to the sender, and that the sender
	reports back to the network. Looking at each in turn:


	</p>
<blockquote class="text"><dl>
<dt>The Network</dt>
<dd> In general it is not in any network's interest to under-declare
	  congestion since this will have potentially negative consequences for all users
	  of that network. It may be in its interest to over-declare congestion if, for
	  instance, it wishes to force traffic to move away to a different network or
	  simply to reduce the amount of traffic it is carrying. Congestion Exposure
	  itself won't significantly alter the incentives for and against honest
	  declaration of congestion by a network, but we can imagine applications of
	  Congestion Exposure that will change these incentives. There is a perception
	  among network operators that their level of congestion is a business secret.
	  Today, congestion is one of the worst-kept secrets a network has, because
	  end-hosts can see congestion better than network operators can. Congestion
	  Exposure will enable network operators to pinpoint whether congestion is on
	  one side or the other of any border. It is conceivable that forwarders with
	  underprovisioned networks may try to obstruct deployment of Congestion
	  Exposure. 
</dd>
<dt>The Receiver</dt>
<dd> Receivers generally have an incentive to under-declare
	  congestion since they generally wish to receive the data from the sender as
	  rapidly as possible. <a class='info' href='#Savage'>[Savage]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Savage, S., Wetherall, D., and T. Anderson, &ldquo;TCP Congestion Control with a Misbehaving Receiver,&rdquo; 1999.</span><span>)</span></a> explains how a receiver can
	  significantly improve their throughput my failing to declare congestion. This
	  is a problem with or without Congestion Exposure. <a class='info' href='#KGao'>[KGao]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gao, K. and C. Wang, &ldquo;Incrementally Deployable Prevention to TCP Attack with Misbehaving Receivers,&rdquo; December&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>
	  explains one possible technique to encourage receiver's to be honest in their
	  declaration of congestion.
</dd>
<dt>The Sender</dt>
<dd> One proposed mechanism for Congestion Exposure deployment adds
	  a requirement for a sender to advise the network how much congestion it has
	  suffered or caused. Although most senders currently respond to congestion
	  they are informed of, one use of exposed congestion information might be to
	  encourage sources of persistent congestion to back off more aggressively.
	  Then clearly there may be an incentive for the sender to under-declare
	  congestion. This will be a particular problem with sources of flooding
	  attacks. "Policing" mechanisms have been proposed to deal with this. 
</dd>
</dl></blockquote><p>

	

	In addition there are potential problems from source spoofing. A malicious
	sender can pretend to be another user by spoofing the source address.
	Congestion Exposure allows for "Policers" and "Traffic Shapers" so as to be
	robust against injection of false congestion information into the forward
	path.
