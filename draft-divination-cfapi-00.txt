1.  Introduction

   Fortune-telling, the practice of predicting information about a
   person's life, is an activity practiced throughout history.

   While there are myriad forms of fortune telling methodologies, this
   document applies to a particular form of service that provides
   fortune heuristics, commonly known as "luck", for a particular
   subject based on a calendar-based input.

   Since HTTP [RFC7230] status codes are insufficient to convey
   information about fortune heuristics, this specification defines a
   simple JSON [RFC8259] document format for this purpose.  The response
   can be used by HTTP APIs to deliver results to non-human clients or
   to an end-user.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",
   "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*", "*NOT
   RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only
   when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

   The following definitions apply in this document:

   Well-known URI
      This specification makes use of the "well-known URI" feature of
      HTTP servers [RFC5785] to provide a bootstrapping URI for the
      client usage of fortune heuristics services.

   Root of Fortune
      The service discovery endpoint that provides a URI list of
      available fortune heuristic endpoints available, in accordance
      with Section 6.

3.  Fortune Heuristics Service Well-Known URI

   A well-known URI called "fortune" is registered by this specification
   for fortune heuristics services (see Section 10).

   Services complying with this document *SHOULD* have its well-known
   URI pointing (directly or through redirection) to the Root of
   Fortune.

   The Root of Fortune can be used by the client for service discovery,
   namely, the available calendar-based fortune heuristics services
   available on the server, as specified in Section 6.

3.1.  Well-Known URI Redirection

   Servers *MUST* redirect HTTP requests for that resource to the actual
   "context path" using one of the available mechanisms provided by HTTP
   [RFC7230] (e.g., using a 301, 303, or 307 response).

   Clients *MUST* handle HTTP redirects on the well-known URI.

3.2.  Well-Known URI Cache Behavior

   Servers *SHOULD* set an appropriate Cache-Control header value (as
   according to Section 5.2 of [RFC7234]) in the redirect response to
   set caching behavior as required by the type of response generated.

4.  New HTTP Methods: SEEK and DIVINE

   This specification defines two new HTTP methods: "SEEK" and "DIVINE"
   methods for HTTP [RFC7230].

   While HTTP GET requests are treated equivalently as the "SEEK" and
   "DIVINE" requests, its usage is discouraged and therefore *SHOULD
   NOT* be used.

   Usage of these methods are defined in the sections below.

5.  Defined Data Types: Date-Time Formats

   This specification defines a number of date-time formats as according
   to the conventions of [RFC3339] for the unambiguous communication
   between client and server.

   The types defined are as follows.

   DATETIME
      As described in Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], with the addition that
      reduced accuracy representations described in [ISO.8601-1.2018]
      are supported.  Reduced accuracy date and times are accepted where
      a date or time component (2-digits long) is replaced by "--".
      For example, the date time "2018-04---T01:02:00Z" represents the
      UTC time of 1:02am, on an unknown day within April of the year
      2018.

   DATE
      As described in "DATETIME", but the "time" component will not be
      taken into account in the algorithm.

6.  Fortune Heuristics Service Discovery

6.1.  Root of Fortune Path URI ("/")

   The Root of Fortune URI, defined as "/" in this document, is used for
   service discovery on types of calendar-based fortune heuristics
   available.

   An empty SEEK request with the "application/json" request type *MUST*
   be sent to this endpoint to retrieve the available endpoints.  All
   other HTTP methods *MUST NOT* be supported at this URI.

   An example of such a response is as follows:

   Content-Language: en

   {
     "diviners" : [
       "/astrology",
       "/bazi",
     ]
   }

   A service discovery object *MUST* have the following members:

   diviners
      (JSON array) An array that contains endpoints that conform to this
      specification.  All endpoints listed here are relative to the Root
      of Fortune path.  For example, the path "/astrology" listed in the
      example has an endpoint path of "[root-of-fortune]/astrology",
      where "[root-of-fortune]" indicates the real path of the Root of
      Fortune.

7.  Fortune Heuristics Service Endpoint

   An endpoint offering fortune heuristics services *MUST* adhere to
   specifications in this section.

   A service *MAY* implement multiple divination services based on
   different divination methods, such as the digital oracle shown in
   Figure 1.

7.1.  Service Specification Request

   To retrieve capabilities and parameters of an endpoint complying with
   this specification, a service specification JSON object is returned.

   An empty SEEK request with the "application/json" request type *MUST*
   be sent to this endpoint to retrieve the service specification that
   describes parameters accepted by this endpoint.

   Two examples of such a response are given below.

   A report object *SHOULD* contain the following members:

   type
      (URI, mandatory) A URI that defines the type of the report located
      at the "report" key of this object.

   report
      (object, mandatory) An object that contains two keys, "intervals"
      and "events".  The "intervals" object contains an array of
      interval objects that matches the demanded intervals in the
      request within the target date range.  The "events" object
      contains an array of significant event objects within the target
      date range.

   Fortune heuristic reports are created by a divination output that
   *MAY* requires quantitative interpretation.  A sample representation
   of interpreting a graphical divination output is provided in
   Figure 2.

8.3.  Report Interval Object

   The "intervals" value of a report object contains a number of report
   intervals -- each representing a non-overlapping period of the
   selected interval length.  When all of these intervals are put
   together, the combined period *MUST* fully cover the requested report
   target period.

   An example interval object is shown below.

  {
    "dateStart": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "dateEnd": "2018-02-01T00:00:00Z",
    "categories": [
      {
        "category":
          "https://divine.example.com/astrology/categories/health"
        "value": 80,
        "description": "Charge ahead with your excellent health."
      },
      {
        "category":
          "https://divine.example.com/astrology/categories/love"
        "value": 70,
        "description": "Give a certain person or situation another try!"
      },
      {
        "category":
          "https://divine.example.com/astrology/categories/finance"
        "value": 5,
        "description": "You've just realized that you don't have
          any cash on hand."
      }
    ]
  }

   An interval object *MUST* contain the following members:

   dateStart
      (datetime, mandatory) This value specifies the start of the period
      which this interval object applies to.

   dateEnd
      (datetime, mandatory) This value specifies the end of the period
      which this interval object applies to.

   In the given example, the "categories" key is an implementation
   specific object that details heuristic results returned by the
   selected algorithm.  This *MAY* differ in different algorithms.

8.4.  Report Events Object

   The "events" value of a report object contains a number of event
   objects.  Each event object represents an event relevant to the
   calculation of fortune heuristics during a target report period.
   These events *MAY* be of variable time lengths, and *MAY* be
   overlapping amongst each other.

Internet-Draft       Calendar Fortune Heuristics API          March 2018


   The following example demonstrates two event objects the service
   determines relevant to a user's query.

   {
     "dateStart": "2018-01-15T03:20:00",
     "dateEnd": "2018-01-16T20:22:15",
     "description": "The planet of growth and good luck, Jupiter will
       make a harmonious connection with power planet Pluto, helping you
       connect with influential people",
     "recommendation": "Engage in networking during this time."
   },
   {
     "dateStart": "2018-03-22T00:12:40",
     "dateEnd": "2018-03-28T02:45:03",
     "description": "Communication planet Mercury enters your sign,
       which will find you in a busier and chattier mood.",
     "recommendation": "Take charge of work with your newfound energy."
   }

   Similar to an interval object, an event object *MUST* contain the
   following members:

   dateStart
      (datetime, mandatory) This value specifies the start of the period
      described by the event.

   dateEnd
      (datetime, mandatory) This value specifies the end of the period
      described by the event.

   In the given example, the keys "description" and "recommendation" are
   implementation-specific details.  This *MAY* differ in different
   algorithms.

8.5.  Report Generation Errors

   This specification makes use of normal HTTP error codes with the
   following extensions.

   Errors *MUST* be returned using the Problem JSON Structure as
   accordance with [RFC7807].

   422 Unprocessable Entity
      For example, a malformed date-time parameter, or an illogical
      input, such as when the subject's birthday occurs after the report
      target date period.

   473 Beyond Existing Capability

      The service determines that the outcome is too difficult to
      predict.  For example, in the case where the calculation is too
      complex to complete in a certain time period.  The service
      *SHOULD* issue this response code to indicate that the client
      should not try the same request again.

   474 Outcome Impossible
      The service determines that the outcome is impossible.  For
      example, when the algorithm determines that the subject will have
      deceased before the start of the requested target period.

9.  Security Considerations

   o  TLS [RFC5246] and authenticated HTTP requests should be used to
      protect the DIVINE request and responses due to the personal
      nature of information transmitted.

   o  A client *SHOULD* verify the identity of the server on every
      request to prevent impersonation or man-in-the-middle attacks, as
      data transmitted to and from the server is sensitive information,
      and at times critical information to the user.

   o  Synchronization of client and server time *MUST* be well-
      considered in the implementation of this specification.  A
      mismatch of client and server time *MAY* lead to algorithm
      miscalculations that can cause mistaken choices of a user that
      depends on the reliability of this system.

10.  IANA Considerations

10.1.  Well-Known URI Registrations

   This document defines a well-known URI using the registration
   procedure and template from Section 5.1 of [RFC5785].
