      Load-i: Load Index at Site-i, it is the weighted
      combination of the total packets or/and bytes sent to
      and received from the Application Server at Site-i
      during a fixed time period.

      CP-i: capacity index at site I, a higher value means
      higher capacity.

      Network Delay-i: Network latency measurement (RTT) to
      the A-ER that has the Application Server attached at the
      site-i.
