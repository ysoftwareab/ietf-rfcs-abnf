2.  Abstract

This document describes an extensible human-readable accounting record
format, the Accounting Data Interchange Format (ADIF). Based on MIME,
ADIF is designed to compactly represent accounting data from any
protocol using attribute/value pairs or object identifiers.

While in many cases Accounting Servers will produce ADIF records based
on data from accounting protocols, it is also possible for devices to
store data in ADIF format and transfer ADIF records to the accounting
server. The latter approach has the advantage of offloading the
Accounting Server from the task of transcribing interim or session
records, thus improving scalability. This approach also enables the
transport of data from multiple sources within the same set of records.
Where a record format is employed that supports batching, the transport
of multiple records within the same accounting packet is enabled.

2.1.  History

-06 draft: added to terminology section. Fixed ABNF issues with respect
to use of the space character. Added ability to support complex objects
via numbered sub-attributes.  Still needed: examples for protocols other
than RADIUS, including SNMP, L2TP, LDAP and COPS.

3.  Introduction

This document describes an extensible human-readable accounting record
format, the Accounting Data Interchange Format (ADIF). Based on MIME,
ADIF is designed to compactly represent accounting data from any
protocol using attribute/value pairs or object identifiers.

While in many cases Accounting Servers will produce ADIF records based
on data from accounting protocols, it is also possible for devices to
store data in ADIF format and transfer ADIF records to the accounting
server. The latter approach has the advantage of offloading the
Accounting Server from the task of transcribing interim or session
records, thus improving scalability. This approach also enables the
transport of data from multiple sources within the same set of records.
Where a record format is employed that supports batching, the transport
of multiple records within the same accounting packet is enabled.

3.1.  Terminology

This document uses the following terms:

Accounting
          The collection of resource consumption data for the purposes
          of capacity and trend analysis, cost allocation, auditing, and
          billing.  Accounting management requires that resource
          consumption be  measured, rated, assigned, and communicated
          between appropriate parties.

Rating    The act of determining the price to be charged for use of a
          resource.

Billing   The act of preparing an invoice.

Archival accounting
          In archival accounting, the goal is to collect all accounting
          data, to reconstruct missing entries as best as possible in
          the event of data loss, and to archive data for a mandated
          time period. It is "usual and customary" for these systems to
          be engineered to be very robust against accounting data loss.
          Legal or financial requirements frequently mandate archival
          accounting practices, and may often dictate that data be kept

          confidential, regardless of whether it is to be used for
          billing purposes or not.

Interim accounting
          An interim accounting packet provides a snapshot of usage
          during a user's session. This may be useful in the event of a
          device reboot or other network problem that prevents the
          reception or generation of a session summary packet or session
          record. Interim accounting packets can always be summarized
          without the loss of information.

Session record
          A session record represents a summary of the resource
          consumption of a user over the entire session. Accounting
          gateways creating the session record may do so by processing
          interim accounting events or accounting events from several
          devices serving the same user.

Accounting Protocol
          A protocol used to convey data for accounting purposes.

Accounting server
          The accounting server receives accounting data from devices
          and translates it into session records. The accounting server
          may also take responsibility for the routing of session
          records to interested parties.

4.  Accounting record format requirements

As detailed in [2], solution of the accounting problem in roaming
requires a standardized accounting record format to enable exchange of
accounting data between members of a roaming consortium.  Since
operational roaming services, described in [1], exhibit considerable
diversity in their accounting implementations it is desirable that the
chosen accounting record format be protocol-independent.Since accounting
implementations are continually adding new attributes, extensibility is
useful.

For accounting session records, compactness of representation is a
virtue. Session records can be stored within devices where memory or
non-volatile storage is at a premium. Thus the compactness of the
representation will determine how much data can be stored prior to
experiencing data loss.  To satisfy legal and regulatory requirements it
has become customary to archive session records.  Thus, the compactness
of the representation will determine how much warehouse space is
required to store the tapes or CD-ROMs of the archived data.  In
addition, where session records are transferred over the wire the
compactness of representation will determine bandwidth consumption. For

all these reasons, smaller is better.

It is also desirable that an accounting session records be human
readable. Since the processing of accounting data may ultimately result
in the transfer of funds, it is important that the software producing
and handling session records be correct. Human readable accounting
formats are considerably easier to implement and debug than binary
formats and thus software based on them is more likely to be free of
defects.

In reviewing the current state of the art in accounting data
representation, it was determined that existing approaches could not
satisfy the requirements for generality, extensibility, compactness and
human readability. For example, protocol-specific solutions such as the
SNMP-oriented record format described in [10] do not offer sufficient
flexibility in representing data from other protocols.  They also have
the disadvantage of not being human readable. Existing call detail
records based on fixed record formats, while being human readable, do
not offer the required extensibility.

While XML is human readable as well as being very extensible and
flexible, it is not compact. As a result, XML-based session records are
likely to consume many times more storage space than a MIME-based
approach. While compression techniques can be used to reduce the size of
XML-based session records, the resulting compressed records are still
larger than comparable compressed MIME-based records. As a result, it is
to be expected that XML-based session records will suffer in terms of
compactness.

As a result of these considerations, it was decided to base ADIF on
MIME, described in [11].  The use of MIME has enabled ADIF to represent
both printable and non-printable characters as well as to allow
representation of attributes of unlimited size. Through the use of
attribute numbers and protocol defaults, it has been possible to produce
an accounting record format that is simultaneously human readable,
general, extensible, and compact.

4.1.  Requirements language

In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST,  "MUST  NOT",  "optional",
"recommended",  "SHOULD",  and  "SHOULD  NOT",  are to be interpreted as
described in [5].

5.  Definition of the Accounting Data Interchange Format (ADIF)

ADIF is based on MIME, described in [11] and consists of a header
providing basic information about the records in the file, followed by a
series of records each separated by a separator.



Aboba & Lidyard              Standards Track                    [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT   The Accounting Data Interchange Format    25 April 2000


The header includes the ADIF version number (1 for this document),
device name/description, and collection start date and time. A default
protocol type may be optionally included in the header.  Note that it is
possible to use ADIF in a real-time accounting environment where
individual records are transmitted by the device to the Accounting
Server in ADIF format.  In such a case it is up to the mechanism to
specify whether ADIF headers are included within each record or are
agreed to beforehand via some out-of-band mechanism.

Each record may consist of one or more lines, and as with MIME,
described in [11], lines may be continued by putting a space or tab
character on the succeeding line, allowing attributes to be of arbitrary
length.  Lines beginning with the "#" character are taken as comments
and ignored.

Accounting records have traditionally been human-readable, so as to
allow them to be more easily debugged. ADIF attributes can be expressed
either in NVT ASCII (characters 32 through 126) or if non-printable
characters are required, in base64.

ADIF includes support for encoding of attributes for any protocol
utilizing attribute/value pairs or object identifiers. This includes
RADIUS, defined in [3] and [4], RTFM, defined in [14] and [15], L2TP,
defined in [8] as well as SNMP, TACACS+ and COPS, defined in [16].  The
protocol type is indicated by prepending the protocol keyword as defined
by IANA and a "//" to the attribute number, i.e. radius//46.

To improve compactness, when a default protocol is indicated in the
header, attributes of the default protocol do not need to include the
protocol type.  For example, if defaultProtocol: rtfm is indicated in
the ADIF header, then 32 may be used instead of rtfm//32.

In order to allow for compact representation of object identifiers, the
ADIF header allows the definition of oid-names that can be used in place
of an object-identifier sub-tree. For example, the inclusion of a header
statement:
oid-define: mib-2=1.3.6.1.2.1;

would permit the string "mib-2" to substitute for the sub-tree
1.3.6.1.2.1 wherever this occurred within the accounting record file.
This would allow the OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.2 to be abbreviated as mib-2.2.

Protocols such as L2TP, defined in [8] include additional fields such as
Vendor ID and flags in their Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs). Protocols
such as COPS, defined in [16] include attribute numbers expressed as a
combination of C-Num and C-Type as well as supporting complex objects.
To encode such AVPs, ADIF includes support for attribute numbers
expressed in OID form, as well as sub-attributes.

INTERNET-DRAFT   The Accounting Data Interchange Format    25 April 2000


Sub-attributes are included as additional fields, separated by a semi-
colon, and are of the form <subattribute> = <value>. Sub-attributes used
in complex objects are numbered starting from 1; letters are used for
well-known sub-attributes.  This document includes support for the
following well-known sub-attributes: VendorId, VendorType, Mandatory and
Hidden, which apply to all protocols. Other sub-attributes may be added
as needed. Use of the VendorId and VendorType sub-attribute may be used
for expression of vendor-specific attributes, such as those supported in
RADIUS.

As an example, the L2TP version number attribute (attribute 2) with the
Mandatory bit set would be expressed as "l2tp//2: 1; M=1".  A COPS In-
Interface object (C-Num=3, C-Type=1, including an IPv4 address of
204.57.137.2 and an interface index of 1) would be expressed as
"cops//3.1: 1=204.57.137.2; 2=1"

7.  Security Considerations

Since accounting data may include sensitive information, it may be
desirable for this information to be kept confidential during
transmission. Several mechanisms may be used to accomplish this,
including IPSEC, described in [12].

8.  IANA Considerations

This draft creates two new name spaces that will need to be administered
by IANA, namely the ADIF protocol name and attribute number spaces. In
order to avoid creating any new administrative procedures,
administration of the ADIF protocol name space will piggy-back on the
allocation of IP protocol and UDP/TCP port numbers.  Administration of
the ADIF attribute number space will piggy-back on administration of the
attribute numbers or object identifiers for the protocol in question.

ADIF protocol names are required to be unique, and are created
coincident with allocation of an IP protocol number or UDP/TCP port
number. In applying for a protocol number or UDP/TCP port, a unique
keyword is assigned to the protocol, and this keyword is used as the
ADIF protocol name.

INTERNET-DRAFT   The Accounting Data Interchange Format    25 April 2000


Those wishing to use an ADIF protocol name should first acquire the
rights to use the corresponding protocol or port number. Using an ADIF
protocol name without first obtaining rights to a protocol or port
number creates the possibility of conflict and therefore is to be
discouraged.

Similarly, ADIF attribute numbers are allocated coincident with IANA
allocation of attribute numbers or object identifiers for a given
protocol.
