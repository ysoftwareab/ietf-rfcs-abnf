1. Introduction

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is currently involved
   in the development of a multicast and broadcast service, the
   Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS), and its security
   architecture [MBMS].

   [MBMS] requires the use of the Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY)
   Protocol [RFC3830], to convey the keys and related security
   parameters needed to secure the multimedia that is multicast or
   broadcast.

   One of the requirements that MBMS puts on security is the ability to
   perform frequent updates of the keys.  The rationale behind this is
   that it will be costly for subscribers to re-distribute the
   decryption keys to non-subscribers. The cost for re-distributing the
   keys using the unicast channel should be higher than the cost of
   purchasing the keys for this scheme to have an effect.  To implement
   this, MBMS uses a three level key management, to distribute group
   keys to the clients, and be able to re-key by pushing down a new
   group key.  As illustrated in the section below, MBMS has the need
   to identify which types of key are involved in the MIKEY message,
   and their identity.

   This memo specifies a new Type for the General Extension Payload in
   MIKEY, to identify the type and identity of keys involved.


2. Rationale

   An application where this extension is used is MBMS key management.




Carrara et al.                                                [Page 2]

INTERNET-DRAFT               newtype-keyid                March, 2006


   The key management solution adopted by MBMS uses three level key
   management.  The keys are used in the way described below.
   "Clients" refers to the clients who have subscribed to a given
   multicast/broadcast service.

   * The MBMS User Key (MUK), point-to-point key between the multicast
     server and each client

   * The MBMS Service Key (MSK), group key between the multicast server
     and all the clients

   * The MBMS Traffic Key (MTK), group traffic key between the
     multicast server and all clients.

   The Traffic Keys are the keys that are regularly updated.

   The point-to-point MUK key (first-level key) is shared between the
   multicast server and the client via means defined by MBMS [MBMS].
   The MUK is used as pre-shared key to run MIKEY with the pre-shared
   key method [RFC3830], to deliver (point-to-point) the MSK key. The
   same MSK key is pushed to all the clients, to be used as a (second-
   level) group key.

   Then, the MSK is used to push to all the clients an MTK key (third-
   level key), the actual group key that is used for the protection of
   the media traffic. For example, the MTK could be the master key for
   the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] in the
   streaming case.

   A Key Domain identifier defines the domain where the group keys are
   valid or applicable. For example it may define a specific service
   provider.

   To allow the key distribution described above, an indication of the
   type and identity of keys being carried in a MIKEY message is
   needed. This indication is carried in a new Type of the General
   Extension Payload in MIKEY.

   It is necessary to specify what Crypto Session ID (CS ID) map type
   is associated with a given key.  There are cases, for example the
   download case in MBMS, where the required parameters are signalled
   in-band (each downloaded Digital Rights Management Content Format-
   object [DCF] contains the necessary parameters needed by the
   receiver to process it).  Since the parameters are not transported
   by MIKEY, this implies that a CS ID map type needs to be registered
   to the "empty map" as defined in Table 3, which is to be used when
   the map/policy information is conveyed outside of MIKEY.

3. Relations to MIKEY and GKMARCH

   MIKEY according to [RFC3830] is a registration protocol that
   supports re-keying for unicast in the terms of the MSEC Group Key
   Management Architecture [RFC4046].  MBMS uses MIKEY both as a
   registration protocol and a rekey protocol, and the specified
   extension implements the necessary additions to [RFC3830] that
   allows MIKEY to function both as a unicast and multicast rekey
   protocol in the MBMS setting.


4. The Key ID Information Type for the General Extension Payload

   The General Extension payload in MIKEY is defined in Section 6.15 of
   [RFC3830].  The General Extension payload type (Key ID Information)
   defined in the present document is not restricted to MBMS.
   Applications using this General Extension payload type may define
   new Key ID types, and these applications MUST define the semantics
   and usage of the Key ID Type sub-payloads according to Section 8.
   The MBMS use of the Key ID Type sub-payloads defined in Table 2 is
   specified in [MBMS].

   The Key ID Information Type (Type 3) formats the General Extension
   payload as follows:

                           1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      ! Next payload  !      Type     !            Length             !
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      !                  Key ID Information                           ~
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Next Payload and Length are defined in Section 6.15 of [RFC3830].

     *  Type (8 bits): identifies the type of the General Extension
     Payload [RFC3830]. This memo adds Type 3 to the ones already
     defined in [RFC3830].

          Type      | Value | Comments
          ------------------------------------------------------------
          Key ID    |     3 | information on type and identity of keys

          Table 1. Definition of the new General Extension Payload.

     * Key ID Information (variable length): the general payload data
     transporting the type and identifier of a key.  This field is
     formed by Key ID Type sub-payloads as specified below.


   The Key ID Type sub-payload is formatted as follows:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      !  Key ID Type  ! Key ID Length !            Key ID             ~
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      * Key ID Type (8 bits): describes the type of the key ID.
      Predefined types are listed in Table 2.





         Key ID Type           | Value | Comment
         --------------------------------------
         MBMS Key Domain ID    |     0 | ID of the group key domain
         MBMS Service Key ID   |     1 | ID of the group key
         MBMS Transport Key ID |     2 | ID of the group traffic key

         Table 2. Type definitions for Key IDs.


      *  Key ID Length (8 bits): describes the length of the Key ID
         field in octets.

      *  Key ID (variable length): defines the identity of the key.

   Note that there may be more than one Key ID Type sub-payload in an
   extension, and that the overall length (i.e., the sum of lengths of
   all Key ID Type sub-payloads) of the Key ID information field cannot
   exceed 2^16 - 1 octets.


5. Empty map type definition for the CS ID map type

   When the security policy information is conveyed outside of MIKEY,
   the CS ID map type is set to value defined in Table 3 to indicate




Carrara et al.                                                [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT               newtype-keyid                March, 2006


   "empty map".  In this case, there MUST NOT be any Security Policy
   payload present in the message.


          CS ID map type | Value | Comments
          ------------------------------------------------------------
          Empty map      |     1 | Used when the map/policy information
                         |       | is conveyed outside of MIKEY

          Table 3. Definition of the CS ID map type.


6. Transport Considerations

   As specified in Section 7 of [RFC3830], the underlying transport of
   the MIKEY protocol has to be defined for each type of transport.
   When the Key-ID payload is used with MBMS, the transport is UDP, and
   the usage of MIKEY over UDP in the MBMS setting is defined in
   [MBMS].


7. Security Considerations


   The usage of MIKEY for updating the traffic encryption key (MTK) in
   the broadcast manner, described in Section 2, deviates from the way
   MIKEY [RFC3830] was originally designed.  There are mainly two
   points that are related to the security of the described usage.

   First, the delivery of the MTK is not source origin authenticated,
   but rather protected by a group MAC, keyed by the group key (MSK).
   The threat this raises is that users that are part of the group are
   able to send faked MTK messages to other group members. The origin
   of the MTK messages is a node inside the core network, and the trust
   model used in MBMS, is that only trusted traffic is allowed to be
   sent on the MBMS bearers (from within the operator's network).
   However, there is always the risk that traffic is injected on the
   air interface between the base stations and the user equipment.  It
   is possible for members of the group (i.e., with access to the MSK)
   to spoof MTK updates to other members of the group.  3GPP decided
   that the technical difficulties and costs involved in performing
   such an attack are large enough compared to the expected gain for
   the attacker, that the risk was deemed acceptable.  Note that, since
   the delivery of the MTK is not source origin authenticated, there is
   nothing gained by adding source origin authentication to the RTP
   streams (e.g., using SRTP-TESLA [SRTP_TESLA]).  Hence, the current
   use of the specified extension is not compatible with SRTP-TESLA,
   which requires source origin authentication of the integrity key.



Carrara et al.                                                [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT               newtype-keyid                March, 2006


   Note that in MBMS the MSK is protected end-to-end, from the
   multicast server to the clients, using a client-unique key MUK, but
   the MTK is delivered under protection by the group key MSK, so
   source origin authentication is not achieved.

   Secondly, the delivery of the MTK is separated from the delivery of
   the security policy.  The security policy is delivered with the MSK.
   The delivery of the MTKs is assumed to be very frequent (some
   scenarios require the delivery of MTKs to be as frequent as a few
   seconds apart).  This would imply that the cost (in terms of
   bandwidth) would be very high if the security policy was delivered
   together with each MTK.  Furthermore, the security policy parameters
   of the streaming session are not anticipated to change during the
   session, even though there would be an update of the MTK.  It was
   decided in 3GPP that there was no need for updating the policy
   during an ongoing session, and the cost of allowing such a feature,
   only to be on the safe side, would be too high.  On the other hand,
   updating the security policy during an ongoing session would be
   possible by updating the MSK.

   The Empty map type used when the security policy is delivered in
   band relies on the security provided by DCF [DCF], and MIKEY is in
   this case only used to provide the master key for the DCF
   processing.


8. IANA Considerations

   Please add the following to the IANA registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/mikey-payloads (To be removed by
   after IANA processing).

   According to Section 10 of RFC 3830, IETF consensus is required to
   register values in the range 0-240 in the Type namespace of the
   MIKEY General Extension Payload and the CS ID map type namespace of
   the Common Header Payload.

   A new value in the MIKEY General Extension Payload Type name space
   needs to be registered for this purpose.  The registered value for
   Key ID is requested to be 3 according to Section 4.

   It is also requested to register the value 1 for the Empty map in
   the existing CS ID map namespace of the Common Header Payload as
   specified in Table 3 in Section 5.

   The new name space for the following field in the Key ID information
   sub-payload (from Sections 4 and 5) is requested to be managed by
   IANA:



Carrara et al.                                                [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT               newtype-keyid                March, 2006



   * Key ID Type

   It is requested that IANA register the pre-defined types of Table 2
   for this namespace.  IANA is also requested to manage the definition
   of additional values in the future.  Values in the range 0-240 for
   each name space SHOULD be approved by the process of IETF consensus
   and values in the range 241-255 are reserved for Private Use,
   according to [RFC2434].
