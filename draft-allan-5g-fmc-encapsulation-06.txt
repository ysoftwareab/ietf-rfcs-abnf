    5G Wireless Wireline Convergence User Plane Encapsulation (5WE)

Abstract 
 
   As part of providing wireline access to the 5G Core (5GC), deployed  
   wireline networks carry user data between 5G residential gateways  
   and the 5G Access Gateway Function (AGF). The encapsulation method  
   specified in this document supports the multiplexing of traffic for 
   multiple PDU sessions within a VLAN delineated access circuit, 
   permits legacy equipment in the data path to inspect certain packet 
   fields, carries 5G QoS information associated with the packet data, 
   and provides efficient encoding. It achieves this by specific points 
   of similarity with the RFC 2516 PPPoE data packet encapsulation.

1. Introduction 
    
   Converged 5G ("fifth generation") wireline networks carry user data  
   between 5G residential gateways (5G-RG) and the 5G Access Gateway 
   Function (identified as a Wireline-AGF (W-AGF) by 3GPP in [TS23316]) 
   across deployed access networks based on Broadband Forum [TR101] and 
   [TR178].  
    
   The transport encapsulation used needs to meet a variety of 
   requirements including the following: 
    
   -  The ability to multiplex multiple logical connections (Protocol 
     Data Unit (PDU) Sessions as defined by 3GPP) within a VLAN 
     identified point to point logical circuit between a 5G-RG and a W-
     AGF. 
    
   - To allow unmodified legacy equipment in the data path to identify 
      the encapsulation and inspect specific fields in the payload. 
      Some access nodes in the data path between the 5G-RG and the W-
      AGF (Such as digital subscriber loop access multiplexers (DSLAMs) 
      and optical line terminations (OLTs)) currently inspect packets 
      identified by specific Ethertypes to identify protocols such as 
      the point to point protocol over ethernet (PPPoE), IP, ARP, and

      IGMP. This may be for the purpose of enhanced QoS, policing of 
      identifiers and other applications. Some deployments are 
      dependent upon this inspection. Such devices are able to do this 
      for PPPoE or IP over ethernet (IPoE) packet encodings but would 
      be unable to do so if a completely new encapsulation, or an 
      existing encapsulation using a new Ethertype, were used. 
    
   -  To carry per packet 5G QoS information.  
    
   -  Fixed access residential gateways are sensitive to the complexity 
     of packet processing, therefore an encapsulation that minimizes 
     processing is an important consideration.  
    
   A data encapsulation that uses a common Ethertype and has certain 
   fields appearing at the same offset as the [RFC2516] PPPoE data 
   encapsulation can address these requirements. This data 
   encapsulation is referred to as the 5G WWC user plane Encapsulation 
   or 5WE. Currently deployed access nodes do not police the VER, TYPE 
   and CODE fields of an RFC 2516 header, and only perform limited 
   policing of stateful functions with respect to the procedures 
   documented in RFC 2516. Therefore, these fields have a different 
   definition for 5WE and are used to: 
       
   -  Identify that the mode of operation for packets encapsulated in 
     such a fashion uses non-access stratum (NAS, a logical control 
     interface between user equipment (UE) and 5GC as specified by 
     3GPP) based 5G WWC session establishment and life cycle 
     maintenance procedures as documented in [TS23502][TS23316] instead 
     of legacy PPP/PPPoE session establishment procedures (i.e. PADI 
     discipline, LCP, NCP etc.). In this scenario "discovery" is 
     performed by means outside the scope of this document. 
    
   -  Permit the session ID field to be used to identify the 5G PDU 
     session the encapsulated packet is part of. 
 
   -  Communicate per-packet 5G QoS Flow Identifier (QFI) and 
     Reflective QoS Indication (RQI) information from the 5GC to the 
     5G-RG. 
      
   This 5G specific redesign of fields not inspected by deployed 
   equipment results in an encapsulation uniquely applicable to the 
   requirements for the communication of PDU session traffic between 
   the subscriber premises and the 5G system over wireline networks.  
   The 6 byte RFC 2516 data packet header followed by a 2 byte PPP 
   protocol ID is also the most frugal of the encapsulations that are 
   currently supported by legacy access equipment that could be adapted 
   to meet these requirements.

   This encapsulation is expected to be used in environments where RFC 
   2516 is deployed. Therefore implementations are required to examine 
   the version number and react accordingly. 

   This encapsulation may have MTU issues when used for Ethernet 
   multiplexing in networks where the underlying Ethernet payload is 
   limited to 1500 bytes.  

   This encapsulation is not suitable for other network environments, 
   e.g., general use over the public Internet.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", 
   "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as

   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

2. Data Encapsulation Format 
    
   The Ethernet payload [IEEE802] for PPPoE [RFC2516] is indicated by 
   an Ethertype of 0x8864. The information following that Ethertype 
   uses a value of 2 in the VER field for the repurposing of the PPPoE 
   data encapsulation as the 5G WWC user plane encapsulation (5WE). The 
   5G WWC User Plane encapsulation is structured as follows:

   The description of each field is as follows: 
    
      VER is the version. It MUST be set to 0x02. 
 
      TYPE is the message type. It MUST be set to 0x01.    
    
      QFI encodes the 3GPP 5G QoS Flow Identifier [TS38415] to be used  
          for mapping 5G QoS to IP DSCP/802.1 P-bits [IEEE802]. 
    
      R (short for Reflective QoS Indication [TS38415]) encodes the one  
          bit RQI. It is set by the network side 5WE termination for  
          downstream traffic and ignored by the network for upstream  
          traffic. 
    
      0 indicates the bit(s) MUST be sent as zero and ignored on  
          receipt. 
    
      SESSION_ID is a 16-bit unsigned integer in network byte order. It  
          is used to distinguish different PDU sessions that are in the  
          VLAN delineated multiplex. A value of 0xffff is reserved for     
          future use and MUST NOT be used. 
    
      LENGTH is the length in bytes of the data payload including 
          the initial Protocol ID. It is 16 bits in network byte order. 
    
      PROTOCOL ID is the 16 bit identifier of the data payload type  
          encoded using values from the IANA PPP DLL protocol numbers  
          registry. (https://www.iana.org/assignments/ppp-numbers/ppp-
          numbers.xhtml#ppp-numbers-2) 

          The following values are valid in this field for 5G  
          WWC use: 
    
               0x0021: IPv4 
    
               0x0031: Ethernet (referred to in PPP as "bridging")

          Packets received that do not contain one of the above  
          protocol IDs are silently discarded. 
    
      DATA PAYLOAD is encoded as per the protocol ID.  
    
3. Acknowledgements 
    
   This memo is a result of comprehensive discussions by the Broadband 
   Forum's Wireline Wireless Convergence Work Area. 
   The authors would also like to thank Joel Halpern and Dirk Von Hugo 
   for their detailed review of this draft. 
    
4. Security Considerations 
    
   5G NAS procedures used for session life cycle maintenance employ 
   ciphering and integrity protection [TS23502]. They can be considered 
   to be a more secure session establishment discipline than existing 
   RFC 2516 procedures, at least against on path attackers. 
   The design of the 5WE encapsulation will not circumvent existing 
   anti-spoofing and other security procedures in deployed equipment. 
   The existing access equipment will be able to identify fields that 
   they normally process and policed as per existing RFC 2516 traffic. 
    
   Therefore, the security of a fixed access network using 5WE will be 
   equivalent or superior to current practice. 
    
   5WE encapsulated traffic is used on what the 5GC considers to be 
   trusted non-3GPP interfaces, therefore is not ciphered. 5WE is not 
   suitable for use over an untrusted non-3GPP interface. 
    
    
5. IANA Considerations 
    
   IANA is requested to create a registry on the Point-to-Point (PPP) 
   Protocol Field Assignments IANA Web page as follows:
