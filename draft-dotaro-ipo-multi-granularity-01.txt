1. Abstract

   The multi-granularity concept in optical networks is the ability to
   simultaneously switch different levels of granularity inside a given
   optical network. Optical multi-granularity and particularly waveband
   switching raises some issues for GMPLS. These have been partially
   addressed in [GMPLS-ARCH] and [GMPLS-SIG] from the CCAMP Working
   Group. However, enabling multi-granularity in optical networks
   demands the definition of a more complete set of requirements
   considering the management, control, routing and signaling issues
   and their impacts in the GMPLS protocols suite.

   In this framework document we propose to extend GMPLS previous set
   of switching capabilities in the optical domain. This by identifying
   uncovered characteristics of the optical transport, taking into
   account interest for optical components working at the band level
   and its impact on the control of the optical networks.

  Optical Multi-Granularity û Architectural Framework November 2001



2. Introduction

   Starting from MPLS labeled packet switching and MPLS-TE concepts,
   Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) introduces a new architecture and new
   building blocks to support additional switching layers, i.e. TDM,
   wavelength, waveband and fiber switching. In the framework of
   optical networking, the switching types of interest are mainly
   wavelength, waveband and fiber. Multi-granularity consists in
   combining and operating these switching layers in optical networks.
   Optical multi-granularity is quite a new concept, however
   feasibility and benefits of the approach have already been
   demonstrated [ONDM00-MGOXC], [OFC01-MGOXC].

   Available optical multi-granularity technologies spanning components
   and systems (de/multiplexer, switch ,MG-OXC,...) indicate the
   growing interest to multi-granularity concepts and applications,
   while also answering demands and requirements from carriers for the
   support and control of multiple switching layers in optical
   networks. All this aspects concur to position multi-granularity as a
   relevant item in today optical networking framework.

   Optical multi-granularity and particularly waveband switching raises
   some issues for GMPLS. These have been partially addressed in
   [GMPLS-ARCH] and [GMPLS-SIG] from the CCAMP Working Group. However,
   enabling multi-granularity in optical networks demands the
   definition of a more complete set of requirements considering the
   management, control, routing and signaling issues and their impacts
   in the GMPLS protocols suite.

   In this memo, we propose to use this concept of multiple optical
   granularities in the GMPLS context in association with grooming
   strategies. Among possible optical switching granularities, waveband
   is an attractive trade-off for foreseen traffic volumes in next few
   years and will be particularly considered in the following. For this
   purpose, a new type of interface û WaveBand Switch Capable(WBSC) -
   is introduced completing the existing set of interfaces.
   Consequently a new type of Label Switched Path, the WaveBand-LSP
   (WB-LSP), is considered along with a new class of Forwarding
   Adjacencies (FA) as described in Section 4.3.

3. Rationale

   The sub-IP area and IPO Working Group are the most suitable
   locations for the proposed document as they addresse issues and
   considerations related and specific to optical networking.

   On basis of charter items, this memo fits into the IPO Working Group
   since it documents issues and requirements of an optical specific
   concept and technology. The document proposes and describes a
   framework for optical multi-granularity and its impact on the GMPLS
   protocols suite, notably routing and signaling aspects.

   A complementary work is being initiated in the CCAMP Working Group
   based on the present document used as architectural framework. It
   addresses GMPLS building blocks enhancement and protocol suite
   extension to cover optical multi-granularity and particularly
   waveband switching.

5. Multi-Granularity Considerations

5.1 Context and definition

   Considering that traffic increases faster than connectivity,
   widening switching granularity scope becomes valuable. Optical
   multi-granularity concept, including particularly waveband
   switching, allows to match those new requirements of granularity
   diversity.

   The use and exploitation of multiple granularities in optical
   networks relies on availability of proper hardware (components and
   systems), on methods to nest LSPs and especially on protocols
   integrating the specific features of optical multi-granularity.

   The multi-granularity concept in optical networks refers to the
   ability to simultaneously switch different levels of granularity
   inside a given optical network. The granularities considered at the
   optical layer are single wavelengths (L-LSP), band of wavelengths,
   i.e. wavebands (WB-LSP), and fibers (F-LSP).

   In order to take benefits from these switching granularities, it is
   necessary to be able to provision and handle LSPs at such
   granularities. The operation to assemble and combine LSPs into
   coarser LSPs is called grooming, also known as LSPs nesting. The
   process of grooming lower granularity LSPs into larger ones is
   analog to the LSP stacking scheme used in MPLS. Typical case of

E.Dotaro et al.                                                      3

  Optical Multi-Granularity û Architectural Framework November 2001


   grooming consists in aggregating L-LSPs into WB-LSPs and WB-LSPs
   into F-LSPs. Section 6.1 addresses the various aspects of grooming
   strategies.

   Therefore, extensions to GMPLS previous set of switching
   capabilities in the optical domain are proposed in this framework
   document. This is achieved by identifying uncovered characteristics
   of the optical transport, taking into account interest for optical
   components working at the band level and its impact on the control
   of the optical networks.

   In the efforts of describing the requirements and set of
   capabilities for optical multi-granularity, three approaches to
   waveband switching have been identified:
        - Inverse Multiplexing
        - Wavelength Concatenation
        - Waveband

   The availability of optical and/or photonic switching equipment
   capable to work at the band level û i.e. build out of band
   components and hardware - motivates the redefinition of waveband
   switching as defined in the GMPLS architecture. Current definition
   of waveband switching (see [GMPLS-ARCH] and [GMPLS-SIG]) refers to
   inverse multiplexing mechanism or wavelength concatenation
   (ôcontiguousö lambdas) were one can request a 10 Gbps L-LSP (logical
   waveband) while the underlying (physical) wavelength operates at 2.5
   Gbps. While this definition is still valid and applicable, it does
   not consider the approach where band has a physical signification,
   i.e. where the interface is waveband switch capable (WBSC). The
   following paragraph shows the location of optical multi-granularity
   and highlight the new definition of waveband switching.

5.2 Hierarchy Overview

   The integration of optical multi-granularity in the GMPLS
   architecture requires modifications and extensions to current
   definitions. For this purpose, a new type of switch capable
   interface is first introduced: the Waveband Switch Capable Interface
   (WBSC). The WBSC interface materializes the physical reality of
   optical waveband as an atomic entity or granularity. As with the
   introduction of the waveband switch capable interface, a new class
   of LSP is defined: the WaveBand LSP (WB-LSP).

   WXC, WBXC and FXC can be part of the same entity referred to as MG-
   OXC or MG-PXC.

   The above figure illustrates the hierarchy of the switching layers
   and highlights the optical multi-granularity part. The network
   element column shows typical real-life boxes that support such
   interfaces. Note that this representation does not aim at
   restricting interfaces that network elements can support.

   Section 7 further details the extensions required to support the new
   definition of waveband switching in GMPLS.

5.3 Optical networking with Multi-Granularity

   Enabling multi-granularity into optical networks implies the use of
   specific optical components and systems, which are band-specific
   (filtering and switching functions).

   The use of multi-granularity results in reduction of the number of
   connections through each optical node. This means from the hardware
   point of view a reduction of the number of ports both for the
   switches and for the optical multiplexers and demultiplexers. Hence
   the optical switches have to be seen as a combination of Fiber
   Cross-Connects (FXC), WaveBand Cross-Connects (WBXC) and Wavelengths
   Cross-Connects (WXC) with a significant size reduction.

   Other benefits of multi-granularity systems, especially with
   waveband-based components have to be considered in terms of physical
   impairments since constraints are relaxed by decreasing the optical
   losses.

   The proposed multi-granularity scheme adds a relation between the
   Wavelength layer and the Waveband layer which is similar to the
   relation between IP and the optical layer from the connectivity
   point of view. Hence, all the analysis made in order to justify the
   sub-IP layers may be reuse. For instance the provisioning of cut-
   trough WaveBand-LSP below wavelength layer will allow to save a
   large amount of resource for this last layer. It is analog to
   lightpaths, acting as tunnels for the IP layer. Finally, most of
   existing routing and signaling protocols building blocks are
   applicable, including dissemination of topology information with
   Forwarding Adjacencies (FA) based on WB-LSP.

6. Multi-granularity Concept Applicability

6.1 Grooming strategies

  Optical Multi-Granularity û Architectural Framework November 2001


   The relative limited number of nodes and the relative small
   connectivity in an optical network allows assuming that there is
   potentially a strong correlation between flows of traffic inside
   such network. Hence, a grooming strategy can be envisaged to nest
   low order L-LSPs into higher order LSPs (eg. WB-LSPs or F-LSPs) in
   order to  take benefit of the different switching level (i.e.
   switching granularities).

   Considering a set of L-LSPs sharing the same ingress and egress
   nodes, a higher order LSP could be provisioned between theses nodes
   and the L-LSPs nested into it. This provisioning method is called
   End-To-End grooming.

   Furthermore, we can assume that the correlation of traffic flows
   will be greater in the core of the network than at its periphery.
   Considering a set of L-LSPs not sharing the same ingress or/nor the
   same egress nodes, but sharing a common sub-path, a higher order LSP
   could be provisioned over this sub-path and the L-LSPs nested into
   it. This grooming strategy is called Intermediate grooming. Note
   that End-To-End grooming is just a peculiar case of Intermediate
   grooming, where the sub-path shared by the L-LSPs equals the entire
   path (i.e. same source-destination pair).

6.2 Grooming applicability scope

   The current L-LSPs nesting definition under the concept of waveband,
   as defined in [GMPLS-ARCH] and [GMPLS-SIG], has a restricted
   applicability scope. We propose to enhance the grooming
   possibilities of L-LSPs so as to widen this field.

   From these definitions, two L-LSPs nesting scenarios have been
   envisaged.
   (1) Waveband switching refers to inverse multiplexing such that only
   end-to-end grooming can be achieved and consequently quite
   restrictive and limited in its applicability scope.
   (2) Waveband switching refers to a kind of optical wavelength
   virtual concatenation (wavebands are logically defined û at the
   control plane level only - as a group of wavelengths). This scenario
   is quite flexible in terms of L-LSP virtual nesting but is
   incompatible with the physical constraints of effectively switching
   a set of wavelengths as a single physical unit.

   In the context of this memo, these two previous scenarios either do
   not take advantage of the natural intermediate grooming strategy or
   do not take advantage of the emerging waveband switching and
   multiplexing technologies.

   The principle of grooming optical granularities, taking into account
   the new WB-LSP, is analog in the optical domain to LSPs stacking in
   MPLS-TE and to the LSP hierarchy that ensues.

   The following example illustrates the new grooming strategy combined
   with the WB-LSP.

   Let us consider, in this example, that wavebands are composed of
   four wavelengths. Let us also consider that A has one L-LSP
   established with C and one with D, that B has one L-LSP established
   with C and two with D.

   In a wavelength only switching network, these connections would have
   been established and routed as L-LSPs and wavelengths switched. But
   in a wavelength and waveband switching network, where nodes E, F, G
   and H are wavelength and waveband switch capable, a WB-LSP could be
   established and routed between nodes E and H. The WB-LSP formed is
   composed of any four L-LSPs amongst the five ones entering node E.

6.3 Provisioning Strategies

   The introduction of multi-granularity has proven its potential,
   however the provisioning of the corresponding LSPs brings a new set
   of problems such as information flooding, LSPs establishment
   (dynamicity, triggering process, service disruption ...) and other
   issues like protection.

   In order to make efficient use of waveband switching concept, the
   new WBSC interfaces should be advertised. It is envisaged that IGP
   such as OSPF or IS-IS could flood the relative information. The
   introduction of the new WBSC interface is compliant, considering few
   minor enhancements, with Traffic Engineering extensions to OSPF
   [OSPF-TE] or IS-IS [ISIS-TE].

   Following information dissemination, different scenarii are
   envisaged for the provisioning of WB-LSPs.



E.Dotaro et al.                                                      7

  Optical Multi-Granularity û Architectural Framework November 2001


   Several provisioning/grooming strategies can be foreseen depending
   on the various triggering mechanisms with more or less Traffic
   Engineering implication.
   From the simple point-and-click case to sophisticated traffic driven
   one, these approaches will use the information resulting from the
   flooding of the FAs. The definition of new traffic engineering
   parameters associated to this new class of FA is beyond the scope of
   this document.

   Nevertheless two TE based approaches dealing with two different
   grooming strategies may illustrate TE implication in provisioning/
   grooming process.

   - On one hand WaveBand-LSPs can be pre-provisioned and then
   considered as tunnels for L-LSPs to be routed/nested into it. This
   method is an application of intermediate grooming paradigm (see
   Section 6.1). Provisioning of such WB-LSPs should be based on large
   time scale rules.

   - On the other hand WaveBand-LSPs can be dynamically established in
   response to a specific triggering mechanism.
   WB-LSPs can be established from end-to-end in response to a WB-LSP
   request, or can be established following several L-LSPs requests.
   Note that re-routing already established L-LSPs into WB-LSPs induces
   an interruption of service during switching time.

7. GMPLS Protocol suite extensions

   Enabling optical multi-granularity demands the definition of a
   complete set of requirements considering the management, control,
   routing and signaling issues. The details of the enhancement are
   addressed in the companion document [CCAMP-WB] in the CCAMP WG. It
   covers particularly the routing and signaling aspects.

   The major extension is the introduction of a WaveBand Switch Capable
   Interface (WBSC) with its associated components (WB-LSP, Link
   Multiplex Capability Value and Descriptor,). Routing aspects also
   include the definition of new sub-TLV descriptor for OSPF and IS-IS
   to advertise waveband capable links (FAs). From a signaling point of
   view, the Generalized Label Request is augmented to support WB-LSP
   establishment, while the generalized label is kept unchanged.
   Specific extensions to signaling protocols (RSVP-TE, CR-LDP) are
   currently under definition.

   Other open issues such as LMP considerations, definition of waveband
   specific TE parameters will be further specified.

8. Security Considerations

   This memo does not introduce new security consideration from the one
   already detailed in the GMPLS protocol suite.
