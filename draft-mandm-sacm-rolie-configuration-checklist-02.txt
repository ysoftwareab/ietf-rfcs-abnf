       Definition of the ROLIE configuration checklist Extension
           draft-mandm-sacm-rolie-configuration-checklist-02

Abstract

   This document extends the Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information
   Exchange (ROLIE) core to add the information type categories and
   related requirements needed to support security configuration
   checklist use cases.  Additional categories, properties, and
   requirements based on content type enables a higher level of
   interoperability between ROLIE implementations, and richer metadata
   for ROLIE consumers.  Additionally, this document discusses
   requirements and usage of other ROLIE elements in order to best
   syndicate security configuration checklists.

1.  Introduction

   Default configurations for endpoints (operating systems,
   applications, etc.) are normally geared towards ease-of-use or ease-
   of-deployment, not security.  As such, many enterprises operate
   according to guidance provided to them by a control framework
   ([CIS_Critical_Controls], [PCI_DSS], [NIST_800-53] etc.), which often
   prescribe that an enterprise define a standard, security-minded
   configuration for each technology they operate.  Such standard
   configurations are often referred to as configuration checklists.
   This document defines an extension to the Resource-Oriented
   Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE) protocol
   [I-D.ietf-mile-rolie] to support the publication of configuration
   checklist information.  Configuration checklists contain a set of
   configuration recommendations for a given endpoint.  A configuration
   recommendation prescribes expected values pertaining to one or more
   discrete endpoint attributes.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The previous key words are used in this document to define the
   requirements for implementations of this specification.  As a result,
   the key words in this document are not used for recommendations or
   requirements for the use of ROLIE.

   As an extension of [RFC8322], this document refers to many terms
   defined in that document.  In particular, the use of "Entry" and
   "Feed" are aligned with the definitions presented in section TODO of
   ROLIE.

   Several places in this document refer to the "information-type" of a
   Resource (Entry or Feed).  This refers to the "term" attribute of an
   "atom:category" element whose scheme is
   "urn:ietf:params:rolie:category:information-type".  For an Entry,
   this value can be inherited from it's containing Feed as per
   [RFC8322].

   Other terminology used in this document is defined below:

   Configuration Item  Generally synonymous with endpoint attribute.

   Configuration Checklist  A configuration checklist is an organized
      collection of rules about a particular kind of system or platform.

   Configuration Recommendation  A configuration recommendation is an
      expression of the desired posture of one or more configuration
      items.  A configuration recommendation generally includes the
      description of the recommendation, a rationale statement, and the
      expected state of collected posture information.

   TODO: There needs to be a "normative" reference to the SCAP 1.2/3
   specifications and schema definitions

3.  The 'configuration-checklist' information-type

   This document registers a new information type for use in ROLIE
   repositories.  The "configuration-checklist" information type
   represents a body of information describing a set of configuration
   recommendations.  A configuration recommendation is, minimally, a
   single configuration item paired with a recommended value or range of



Banghart, et al.        Expires January 14, 2021                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                rolie-cc-ext                     July 2020


   values.  Depending on the source, a configuration recommendation may
   carry with it additional information (i.e.  description, references,
   rationale, etc.).  Provided below is a non-exhaustive list of
   information that may be considered as components of a configuration
   checklist.

   o  A "Data Stream"

   o  A "Benchmark"

   o  A "Profile"

   o  A "Value"

   o  A "Rule" or "Group" of Rules

      *  Description

      *  Rationale

      *  Remediation Instructions

      *  Information, described in the dialect of a supported "check
         system", indicating the method(s) used to audit the checklist
         configuration item.

   o  Applicable Platform Information

   o  Information regarding a set of patches to be evaluated

4.  rolie:property Extensions

   A breadth of metadata may be included with a configuration checklist
   as identifying information.  A publishing organization may wish to
   recognize or attribute checklist authors or contributors, or maintain
   a revision/version history over time.  Other metadata that may be
   included could indicate the various categories of products to which
   the checklist applies, such as Operating System, Network Device, or
   Application Server.

   This document registers several new rolie:property elements to
   express this metadata in a more efficient and automatable form.

   o  contributor (0..n)

      *  name: urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:checklist:contributor

Internet-Draft                rolie-cc-ext                     July 2020


      *  value: Indicates those individuals noted as recognized
         contributors to the configuration checklist and/or the
         recommendations contained within.  The value MUST be either a
         plaintext name of a entity, or a link to an <author> element
         that describes an entity.

   o  checklist version

      *  name: urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:checklist:version

      *  value: Indicates the version/revision number of the
         configuration checklist.  Implementations MAY choose to
         incorporate a semantic versioning scheme illustrating
         "major.minor.point" releases, such as "3.1.1".

   o  title

      *  name: urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:checklist:title

      *  value: Indicates the document title of the configuration
         checklist, such as "CIS Benchmark for Microsoft Windows Server
         2019".

   o  overview

      *  name: urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:checklist:overview

      *  value: This property allows for a textual overview and/or
         introduction to the configuration checklist including, but not
         limited to, overview of the technology under assessment,
         limitations or caveats, or assumptions to be made when
         evaluating the checklist.

   o  product name (0..n)

      *  name: urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:checklist:product-name

      *  value: This property allows for further refinement and
         identification of the configuration checklist using the name of
         the product or products to which the checklist applies, such as
         Microsoft Windows Server 2019, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, IBM
         WebSphere Application Server, Google Chrome, etc.

   o  product category (0..n)

      *  name: urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:checklist:product-category

5.  Handling Existing Checklist Formats

   Today, checklists are distributed in a myriad of different formats,
   using a variety of organization schemes.  This standard attempts to
   be as flexible as possible in its approach, in order to be usable by
   as many checklist distributors as possible.

   Using the NIST National Checklist Program as a foundation, checklists
   consist of a primary set of content and a list of supporting content.
   These pieces of content come in a number of machine readable and



Banghart, et al.        Expires January 14, 2021                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                rolie-cc-ext                     July 2020


   human readable formats, and it is out of scope of this standard to
   describe guidance for all them.  Instead, a best effort should be
   made to use the available properties, elements, and attributes to
   describe the content.  Moreover, the content is often a compressed
   file that consists of a package of other content.  Likewise,
   describing this nested structure is out of scope for this standard.
   Each organization should use a description scheme that best matches
   their use and business cases, and this description scheme should be
   documented as thoroughly as possible for all users.

   When existing identifiers, titles, authors, and dates are provided in
   machine-readable forms inside a ROLIE Entry, automated processes can
   find and acquire checklist content with more ease than the current
   state-of-the-art methodology.  Fully solving the checklist automation
   problem will require a more significant effort touching on all parts
   of the checklist ecosystem.

8.  Security Considerations

   Use of this extension requires understanding and managing the
   security considerations of the core ROLIE specification.  Beyond
   that, there must be considerations made for the common use cases and
   data types that would be shared with this extension in particular.

   Checklist information, while typically shared publicly, can have
   potential security impact if compromised.  In these cases, the utmost
   care should be taken to secure the REST endpoint.  Ensure that only
   authenticated users are allowed request access to any part of the
   ROLIE repository.  Authentication schemes such as OAUTH or basic HTTP
   Auth provides a significant barrier to compromise.  When providing
   checklist information as a paid service, security is valuable as a
   means to protect valuable data from being stolen or taken for free.
   In these cases, the above strategies still apply, but providers may
   want to make the Feed visible to non-authenticated users, with
   meaningful error messages sent to users that have not yet paid for
   the service.

   Typical RESTful security measures applied commonly on the web would
   be effective to secure this ROLIE extension.  As a flexible and
   relatively simple RESTful service, ROLIE server implementations have
   great flexibility and freedom in securing their repository.

9.  Privacy Considerations

   This extension poses no additional privacy considerations above and
   beyond those stated in the core ROLIE specification.
