Updates: 2474 (if approved)                                 May 10, 2018
Intended status: Standards Track
Expires: November 09, 2018

IANA Assignment of DSCP Pool 3 (xxxx01) Values to require Publication of
             a Standards Track or Best Current Practice RFC
                 draft-ietf-tsvwg-iana-dscp-registry-05

Abstract

   The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture specifies use of
   a field in the IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers to carry Diffserv
   Codepoint (DSCP) values.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
   (IANA) maintains a registry of assigned DSCP values.

   This update to RFC2474 changes the IANA assignment method for Pool 3
   of the registry (i.e., DSCP values of the form xxxx01) to Standards
   Action, i.e., values are assigned through a Standards Track or Best
   Current Practice RFC. The update also removes permission for
   experimental and Local Use of the Codepoints that form Pool 3 of the
   DSCP registry; Pool 2 Codepoints (i.e., DSCP values of the form
   xxxx11) remain available for these purposes.

1.  Introduction

   The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) [RFC2475] architecture
   (updated by [RFC3260]) provides scalable service differentiation in
   the Internet.  Diffserv uses the six most significant bits of the
   former IPv4 Type of Service (TOS) octet or the former IPv6 Traffic
   Class octet to convey the field, which is used to carry the Diffserv
   Codepoint (DSCP). This DSCP value is used to select a Diffserv Per
   hop Behaviour, PHB.

   The six bit field is capable of conveying 64 distinct codepoints, and
   this codepoint space has been divided into three pools for the
   purpose of codepoint assignment and management (as shown in figure
   1). Pool 1 comprises 32 codepoints [RFC2474].  These are assigned by
   Standards Action, as defined in [RFC8126], i.e., values are assigned
   by Standards Track or Best Current Practice RFCs.  Pool 2 comprises a
   pool of 16 codepoints reserved for experimental or Local Use (EXP/LU)
   as defined in [RFC2474], and Pool 3 comprises 16 codepoints, which
   were specified as "initially available for experimental or local use,
   but which should be preferentially utilized for standardized
   assignments if Pool 1 is ever exhausted" [RFC2474].

   Figure 1: Format of the field for codepoints allocated in the
   three IANA pools (where 'x' refers to either '0' or '1').
   

   At the time of writing this document, 22 of the 32 Pool 1 codepoints
   have currently been assigned.

   Although Pool 1 has not yet been completely exhausted, there is a
   need to assign codepoints for particular PHBs that are unable to use
   any of the unassigned values in Pool 1. This document changes the
   IANA registration policy of Pool 3 to assignment by Standards Action,
   i.e., values are assigned by Standards Track or Best Current Practice
   RFCs, allowing these codepoints to be assigned.

   An example is the need to assign a suitable recommended default
   codepoint for the Lower Effort (LE) per-hop behavior (PHB) [I-D.ietf-
   tsvwg-le-phb].  The LE PHB is designed to protect best-effort (BE)
   traffic (packets forwarded with the default PHB) from LE traffic in
   congestion situations (i.e., when resources become scarce, best-
   effort traffic has precedence over LE traffic and is allowed to
   preempt it). The continued presence of bleaching of the IP precedence
   field in deployed networks can result in setting the first three bits
   of the former TOS byte to zero (disabling any class-based flow
   management by routers configured with TOS-based packet processing).
   There is a need to avoid this remapping of the DSCP for the LE PHB by
   assigning a codepoint that has a zero value in the first three bits
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-le-phb].  Furthermore, if the LE PHB were to have
   been assigned one of the currently unused Pool 1 codepoints with a
   zero value in the first three bits, any bleaching of the IP
   precedence field would result in other (higher assurance) traffic
   being also remapped to the assigned DSCP. This remapping could then
   cause diffserv-marked traffic to receive an unintentional LE
   treatment for the remainder of the Internet path.  It is therefore
   important to avoid the resulting priority inversion.  The absence of
   unassigned codepoints in Pool 1 that exhibit these important
   properties motivates assigning a Pool 3 codepoint as the default that
   is recommended for use with this PHB.

   To allow the IETF to utilise Pool 3 codepoints, this document
   requests IANA to to manage Pool 3 assignments for DSCP values in Pool
   3 via the Standards Action policy [RFC8126].  This assignment method
   requires publication of a Standards Track or Best Current Practice
   RFC.

2.  Terminology

   This document assumes familiarity with the terminology used in
   [RFC2475] updated by [RFC3260].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  The update to RFC2474

   This document updates section 6 of [RFC2474], in the following ways.

   It updates the following text concerning the assignment method:

   OLD: which are initially available for experimental or local use, but
      which should be preferentially utilized for standardized
      assignments if Pool 1 is ever exhausted.

   NEW: which are utilized for standardized assignments (replacing the
      previous availability for experimental or local use).

   It removes the footnote in RFC2474 relating to Pool 3:

   DELETE: "(*) may be utilized for future Standards Action allocations
      as necessary"

   The new registry contents are shown in Figure 2.

       Pool  Codepoint space  Assignment Policy
       ----  --------------- ------------------
   
        1         xxxxx0      Standards Action
        2         xxxx11      EXP/LU
        3         xxxx01      Standards Action
   
   
        Note for Pool 2: "Reserved for experimental or Local Use"

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the use of DSCP values are described in
   the RFCs that define their usage.  This document does not present new
   security considerations.

5.  IANA Considerations

Internet-Draft      IANA DSCP assignment for Pool 3             May 2018


   This section requests IANA to change the use of Pool 3 in the DSCP
   registry and to manage this pool using a Standards Action assignment
   method.

   This requests IANA to make the following changes to the
   Differentiated Services field Codepoints (DSCP) Registry, made
   available at [Registry].

   IANA is requested to reference RFC3260 and this current document for
   Pool 1.

   This update does not modify the IANA registry text for Pool 2. This
   pool continues to preserve the note shown in Figure 2.

   The previous registry text:

      3 xxxx01 Experimental or Local Use May be utilized for future
      Standards Action allocations as necessary.

   is replaced with the following registry text:

      3 xxxx01 Standards Action.

   To manage codepoints in Pool 3, IANA is requested to create and
   maintain a "Pool 3 Codepoints" subregistry.  Pool 3 of the registry
   is to be created initially empty, with a format identical to that
   used for "Pool 1 Codepoints".  IANA is requested to reference RFC3260
   and this current document for Pool 3.

   The Registration Procedure for use of Pool 3 is "Standards Action"
   [RFC8126].  IANA is expected to normally make assignments from Pool
   1, until this Pool is exhausted, but MAY make assignments from Pool 3
   where the format of the codepoint has properties that are needed for
   a specific PHB. The required characteristics for choosing the DSCP
   value MUST be explained in the IANA considerations of the document
   that requests any assignment from Pool 3
