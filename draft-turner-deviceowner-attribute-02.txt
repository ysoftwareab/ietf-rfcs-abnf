Internet-Draft          Device Owner Attribute              August 2009 
    

Abstract 

   This document defines the Device Owner attribute.  This attribute may 
   be included in locations or protocols that support ASN.1 attributes. 

1. Introduction 

   This document specifies the Device Owner attribute.  This attribute 
   may be included in locations or protocols that support ASN.1 
   attribute definitions to indicate the country or group that owns the 
   device. 

   This attribute may be used in authorization decisions. For example, a 
   router deciding whether to connect to another router could check that 
   the device owner present in the device's certificate is on an 
   "approved" list.   

   NOTE: This document does not provide LDAP equivalent schema 
   specification as this attribute is targeted at public key 
   certificates [RFC5280] and attribute certificates [RFC3281bis].  This 
   is left to a future specification. 

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 

1.2. ASN.1 Syntax Notation 

   The attributes are defined using ASN.1 [X.680]. 

2. Device Owner 

   The Device Owner attribute indicates the country or organization that 
   owns the Device with which this attribute is associated.  Device 
   Owner is a choice of ISO 3166 [ISO3166-1] and [ISO3166-2] country 
   codes or an object identifier that represents a group of nations, an 
   organization, or any entity other than a nation.

Internet-Draft          Device Owner Attribute              August 2009 
    

   The following object identifier identifies the Device Owner 
   attribute: 

     id-deviceOwner OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {  
       joint-iso-ccitt(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
       dod(2) infosec(1) attributes(5) 69 
     } 

   The ASN.1 syntax for the Device Owner attribute is as follows: 

     deviceOwner ATTRIBUTE ::= { 
       WITH SYNTAX             DeviceOwner 
       EQUALITY MATCHING RULE  deviceOwnerMatch 
       SINGLE VALUE            TRUE 
       ID                      id-deviceOwner 
     } 

     DeviceOwner  ::= CHOICE { 
       alpha2Country  [0] PrintableString ( SIZE (2) ), 
         -- ISO 3166-1 2 Letter Codes (aka diagram). 
       alpha3Country  [1] PrintableString ( SIZE (3) ), 
         -- ISO 3166-1 3 Letter Codes (aka trigram). 
       alpha4Country  [2] PrintableString ( SIZE (4) ), 
         -- ISO 3166-2 4 Letter Codes (ISO 3166-1 diagram and a hyphen 
         -- followed by one alpha or numeric code). 
       alpha5Country  [3] PrintableString ( SIZE (5) ), 
         -- ISO 3166-2 5 Letter Codes (ISO 3166-1 diagram and a hyphen 
         -- followed by two alpha or numeric codes). 
       alpha6Country  [4] PrintableString ( SIZE (6) ), 
         -- ISO 3166-2 6 Letter Codes (ISO 3166-1 diagram and a hyphen 
         -- followed by three alpha or numeric codes). 
       numericCountry     INTEGER (0..999), 
         -- ISO 3166-1 3 Digit Codes. 
       group              OBJECT IDENTIFIER 
     } 

   There MUST only be one value of Device Owner associated with a 
   device, as distinct owners SHOULD be represented in separate 
   certificates. 

   NOTE: When an environment uses the Device Owner attribute, it is 
   important that the same CHOICE be used throughout the environment.

Internet-Draft          Device Owner Attribute              August 2009 
    

   The following object identifier identifies the Device Owner matching 
   rule: 

     id-matching-rule-deviceOwnerMatch OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=  { 
        joint-iso-ccitt(2) country(16) us(840) organization(1) gov(101) 
        dod(2) infosec(1) matching-rules(9) 6  
     } 

   When performing a match the following matching rule is used: 

     deviceOwnerMatch MATCHING-RULE ::= { 
       SYNTAX  DeviceOwner 
       ID      id-matching-rule-deviceOwnerMatch 
     } 

   This rule returns a TRUE if the strings are the same length and 
   corresponding characters are identical except possibly with regard to 
   case. 

3. Security Considerations 

   If this attribute is used as part of an authorization process, the 
   procedures employed by the entity that assigns each value must ensure 
   that the correct value is applied.  Further, once applied to the 
   object it must be bound to the object; this binding is normally 
   performed by digitally signing over the object and the attribute to 
   ensure data integrity. 

4. IANA Considerations 

   None: All identifiers are already registered.  Please remove this 
   section prior to publication as an RFC.
