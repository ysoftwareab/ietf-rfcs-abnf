1.  Introduction

   Providers of Internet content and other services may wish to
   customize those services based on the geographic location of the user
   of the service.  This is often done using the source IP address used
   to contact the service.  Also, infrastructure and other services
   might wish to publish the locale of their services.  [RFC8805]
   defines geofeed, a syntax to associate geographic locales with IP
   addresses.  But it does not specify how to find the relevant geofeed
   data given an IP address.

   This document specifies how to augment the Routing Policy
   Specification Language (RPSL) [RFC2622] inetnum: class to refer
   specifically to geofeed data CSV files, and how to prudently use
   them.  In all places inetnum: is used, inet6num: should also be
   assumed [RFC4012].

   The reader may find [INETNUM] and [INET6NUM] informative, and
   certainly more verbose, descriptions of the inetnum: database
   classes.

   An optional, utterly awesome but slightly complex means for
   authenticating geofeed data is also defined.

Internet-Draft              Finding Geofeeds                    May 2021


1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Geofeed Files

   Geofeed files are described in [RFC8805].  They provide a facility
   for an IP address resource 'owner' to associate those IP addresses to
   geographic locales.

   Content providers and other parties who wish to locate an IP address
   to a geographic locale need to find the relevant geofeed data.  In
   Section 3, this document specifies how to find the relevant [RFC8805]
   geofeed file given an IP address.

   Geofeed data for large providers with significant horizontal scale
   and high granularity can be quite large.  The size of a file can be
   even larger if an unsigned geofeed file combines data for many
   prefixes, dual IPv4/IPv6 spaces are represented, etc.

   Geofeed data do have privacy considerations, see Section 6; and this
   process makes bulk access to those data easier.

   This document also suggests an optional signature to strongly
   authenticate the data in the geofeed files.

3.  inetnum: Class

   The original RPSL specifications starting with [RIPE81], [RIPE181],
   and a trail of subsequent documents were done by the RIPE community.
   The IETF standardardized RPSL in [RFC2622] and [RFC4012].  Since
   then, it has been modified and extensively enhanced in the Regional
   Interney Registry (RIR) community, mostly by RIPE, [RIPE-DB].
   Currently, change control effectively lies in the operator community.

   The Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL), and [RFC2622] and
   [RFC4012] used by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) specifies
   the inetnum: database class.  Each of these objects describes an IP
   address range and its attributes.  The inetnum: objects form a
   hierarchy ordered on the address space.

   Ideally, RPSL would be augmented to define a new RPSL geofeed:
   attribute in the inetnum: class.  Until such time, this document
   defines the syntax of a Geofeed remarks: attribute which contains an



Bush, et al.            Expires November 20, 2021               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft              Finding Geofeeds                    May 2021


   HTTPS URL of a geofeed file.  The format of the inetnum: geofeed
   remarks: attribute MUST be as in this example, "remarks: Geofeed ",
   where the token "Geofeed" MUST be case-sensitive, followed by a URL
   which will vary, but MUST refer only to a single [RFC8805] geofeed
   file.

       inetnum: 192.0.2.0/24 # example
       remarks: Geofeed https://example.com/geofeed.csv

   While we leave global agreement of RPSL modification to the relevant
   parties, we specify that a proper geofeed: attribute in the inetnum:
   class MUST be "geofeed: ", and MUST be followed by a single URL which
   will vary, but MUST refer only to a single [RFC8805] geofeed file.

       inetnum: 192.0.2.0/24 # example
       geofeed: https://example.com/geofeed.csv

   Registries MAY, for the interim, provide a mix of the remarks:
   attribute form and the geofeed: attribute form.

   The URL's use of the web PKI can not provide authentication of IP
   address space ownership.  It is only used to authenticate a pointer
   to the geofeed file, authenticate the domain name in the URL, and
   provide confidentiality and integrity for the geofeed file in
   transit.  In contrast, the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI,
   see [RFC6481]) can be used to authenticate IP space ownership; see
   optional authentication in Section 4.

   Until all producers of inetnum:s, i.e. the RIRs, state that they have
   migrated to supporting a geofeed: attribute, consumers looking at
   inetnum:s to find geofeed URLs MUST be able to consume both the
   remarks: and geofeed: forms.  The migration not only implies that the
   RIRs support the geofeed: attribute, but that all registrants have
   migrated any inetnum:s from remarks: use to geofeed:s.

   Any particular inetnum: object MUST have at most, one geofeed
   reference, whether a remarks: or a proper geofeed: attribute when it
   is implemented.  If there is more than one, all are ignored.

   If a geofeed CSV file describes multiple disjoint ranges of IP
   address space, there are likely to be geofeed references from
   multiple inetnum: objects.

   As inetnum: objects form a hierarchy, Geofeed references SHOULD be at
   the lowest applicable inetnum: object covering the relevant prefixes
   in the referenced geofeed file.  When fetching, the most specific
   inetnum: object with a geofeed reference MUST be used.

Internet-Draft              Finding Geofeeds                    May 2021


   When geofeed references are provided by multiple inetnum: objects
   which have identical address ranges, then the geofeed reference on
   the inetnum: with the most recent last-modified: attribute SHOULD be
   preferred.

   It is significant that geofeed data may have finer granularity than
   the inetnum: which refers to them.  For example an INETNUM object for
   a prefix P could refer to a geofeed file in which P has been sub-
   divided into one or more longer prefixes.

   Currently, the registry data published by ARIN is not the same RPSL
   as that of the other registries (see [RFC7485] for a survey of the
   whois Tower of Babel); therefore, when fetching from ARIN via FTP
   [RFC0959], whois [RFC3912], RDAP [RFC7482], or whatever, the
   "NetRange" attribute/key MUST be treated as "inetnum" and the
   "Comment" attribute MUST be treated as "remarks".

4.  Authenticating Geofeed Data

   The question arises whether a particular [RFC8805] geofeed data set
   is valid, i.e. is authorized by the 'owner' of the IP address space
   and is authoritative in some sense.  The inetnum: which points to the
   [RFC8805] geofeed file provides some assurance.  Unfortunately, the
   RPSL in many repositories is weakly authenticated at best.  An
   approach where RPSL was signed a la [RFC7909] would be good, except
   it would have to be deployed by all RPSL registries, and there is a
   fair number of them.

   A single optional authenticator MAY be appended to a [RFC8805]
   geofeed file.  It is a digest of the main body of the file signed by
   the private key of the relevant RPKI certificate for the covering
   address range.  One needs a format that bundles the relevant RPKI
   certificate with the signature and the digest of the geofeed text.

   The canonicalization procedure converts the data from its internal
   character representation to the UTF-8 [RFC3629] character encoding,
   and the <CRLF> sequence MUST be used to denote the end of a line of
   text.  Trailing space characters MUST NOT appear on a line of text.
   That is, the space or tab characters must not be followed by the
   <CRLF> sequence.  Thus, a blank line is represented solely by the
   <CRLF> sequence.  Other nonprintable characters, such as backspace,
   are not expected.  For robustness, any nonprintable characters MUST
   NOT be changed by canonicalization.  Trailing blank lines MUST NOT
   appear at the end of the file.  That is, the file must not end with
   multiple consecutive <CRLF> sequences.  Any end-of-file marker used
   by an operating system is not considered to be part of the file
   content.  When present, such end-of-file markers MUST NOT be
   processed by the digital signature algorithm.

   Should the authenticator be syntactically incorrect per the above,
   the authenticator is invalid.

   Borrowing detached signatures from [RFC5485], after file
   canonicalization, the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652]
   would be used to create a detached DER encoded signature which is
   then padded BASE64 encoded (as per [RFC4648]) and line wrapped to 72
   or fewer characters.

   The address range of the signing certificate MUST cover all prefixes
   in the geofeed file it signs; and therefore must be covered by the
   range of the inetnum:.

   An address range A 'covers' address range B if the range of B is
   identical to or a subset of A.  'Address range' is used here because
   inetnum: objects and RPKI certificates need not align on CIDR prefix
   boundaries, while those of the CSV lines in the geofeed file do.

   As the signer specifies the covered RPKI resources relevant to the
   signature, the RPKI certificate covering the inetnum: object's
   address range is included in the [RFC5652] CMS SignedData
   certificates field.

   Identifying the private key associated with the certificate, and
   getting the department with the Hardware Security Module (HSM) to
   sign the CMS blob is left as an exercise for the implementor.  On the
   other hand, verifying the signature requires no complexity; the
   certificate, which can be validated in the public RPKI, has the
   needed public key.  The trust anchors for the RIRs are expected to
   already be available to the party performing signature validation.
   Validation of the CMS signature on the geofeed file involves:

   1.  Obtain the signer's certificate from an RPKI Repository.  The
       certificate SubjectKeyIdentifier extension [RFC5280] MUST match
       the SubjectKeyIdentifier in the CMS SignerInfo SignerIdentifier
       xref target="RFC5286"/>.  If the key identifiers do not match,
       then validation MUST fail.

   2.  Construct the certification path for the signer's certificate.
       All of the needed certificates are expected to be readily
       available in the RPKI Repository.  The certification path MUST be
       valid according to the validation algorithm in [RFC5280] and the
       additional checks specified in [RFC3779] associated with the IP
       Address Delegation certificate extension and the Autonomous
       System Identifier Delegation certificate extension.  If
       certification path validation is unsuccessful, then validation
       MUST fail.

Internet-Draft              Finding Geofeeds                    May 2021


   3.  Validate the CMS SignedData as specified in [RFC5652] using the
       public key from the validated signer's certificate.  If the
       signature validation is unsuccessful, then validation MUST fail.

   4.  Verify that the IP Address Delegation certificate extension
       [RFC3779] covers the address range of the geofeed file.  If the
       address range is not covered, then validation MUST fail.

   5.  Validation of the signing certificate MUST ensure that it is part
       of the current manifest and that the resources are covered by the
       RPKI certificate.

   All of these steps MUST be successful to consider the geofeed file
   signature as valid.

   As the signer specifies the covered RPKI resources relevant to the
   signature, the RPKI certificate covering the inetnum: object's
   address range is included in the [RFC5652] CMS SignedData
   certificates field.

   Identifying the private key associated with the certificate, and
   getting the department with the Hardware Security Module (HSM) to
   sign the CMS blob is left as an exercise for the implementor.  On the
   other hand, verifying the signature requires no complexity; the
   certificate, which can be validated in the public RPKI, has the
   needed public key.

   The appendix MUST be 'hidden' as a series of "#" comments at the end
   of the geofeed file.  The following is a cryptographically incorrect,
   albeit simple example.  A correct and full example is in Appendix A.

       # RPKI Signature: 192.0.2.0/24
       # MIIGlwYJKoZIhvcNAQcCoIIGiDCCBoQCAQMxDTALBglghkgBZQMEAgEwDQYLKoZ

       # End Signature: 192.0.2.0/24

   The signature does not cover the signature lines.

   The bracketing "# RPKI Signature:" and "# End Signature:" MUST be
   present exactly as shown.

   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  It provides usable, albeit
   complex, code to sign geofeed files.

   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-rpki-rta] describes a Cryptographic Message Syntax
   (CMS) profile for a general purpose Resource Tagged Attestation (RTA)
   based on the RPKI.  While this is expected to become applicable in
   the long run, for the purposes of this document, a self-signed root
   trust anchor is used.

5.  Operational Considerations

   To create the needed inetnum: objects, an operator wishing to
   register the location of their geofeed file needs to coordinate with
   their RIR/NIR and/or any provider LIR which has assigned prefixes to
   them.  RIRs/NIRs provide means for assignees to create and maintain
   inetnum: objects.  They also provide means of [sub-]assigning IP
   address resources and allowing the assignee to create whois data,
   including inetnum: objects, and thereby referring to geofeed files.

   The geofeed files MUST be published via and fetched using https
   [RFC2818].

   When using data from a geofeed file, one MUST ignore data outside the
   referring inetnum: object's inetnum: attribute address range.

   If and only if the geofeed file is not signed per Section 4, then
   multiple inetnum: objects MAY refer to the same geofeed file, and the
   consumer MUST use only geofeed lines where the prefix is covered by
   the address range of the inetnum: object they have followed.

   If the geofeed file is signed, and the signer's certificate changes,
   the signature in the geofeed file MUST be updated.

   It is good key hygene to use a given key for only one purpose.  To
   dedicate a signing private key for signing a geofeed file, an RPKI CA
   may issue a subordinate certificate exclusively for the purpose as
   shown in Appendix A.

   To minimize the load on RIR whois [RFC3912] services, use of the
   RIR's FTP [RFC0959] services SHOULD be the preferred access.  This
   also provides bulk access instead of fetching by brute force search
   through the IP space.

   Currently, geolocation providers have bulk whois data access at all
   the RIRs.  An anonymized version of such data is openly available for
   all RIRs except ARIN, which requires an authorization.  However, for
   users without such authorization, the same result can be achieved
   with extra RDAP effort.  There is open source code to pass over such



Bush, et al.            Expires November 20, 2021               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft              Finding Geofeeds                    May 2021


   data across all RIRs, collect all geofeed references, and process
   them [geofeed-finder].

   To prevent undue load on RPSL and geofeed servers, an entity fetching
   geofeed data using these mechanisms MUST NOT do frequent real-time
   look-ups.  [RFC8805] Section 3.4 suggests use of the [RFC7234] HTTP
   Expires Caching Header to signal when geofeed data should be
   refetched.  As the data change very infrequently, in the absence of
   such an HTTP Header signal, collectors SHOULD NOT fetch more
   frequently than weekly.  It would be polite not to fetch at magic
   times such as midnight UTC, the first of the month, etc., because too
   many others are likely to do the same.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   [RFC8805] geofeed data may reveal the approximate location of an IP
   address, which might in turn reveal the approximate location of an
   individual user.  Unfortunately, [RFC8805] provides no privacy
   guidance on avoiding or ameliorating possible damage due to this
   exposure of the user.  In publishing pointers to geofeed files as
   described in this document, the operator should be aware of this
   exposure in geofeed data and be cautious.  All the privacy
   considerations of [RFC8805] Section 4 apply to this document.

   Where [RFC8805] provided the ability to publish location data, this
   document makes bulk access to those data readily available.

7.  Security Considerations

   It is generally prudent for a consumer of geofeed data to also use
   other sources to cross-validate the data.  All the Security
   Considerations of [RFC8805] apply here as well.

   As mentioned in Section 4, many RPSL repositories have weak if any
   authentication.  This allows spoofing of inetnum: objects pointing to
   malicious geofeed files.  Section 4 suggests an unfortunately complex
   method for stronger authentication based on the RPKI.

   If an inetnum: for a wide prefix (e.g. a /16) points to an RPKI-
   signed geofeed file, a customer or attacker could publish an unsigned
   equal or narrower (e.g. a /24) inetnum: in a whois registry which has
   weak authorization.

   The RPSL providers have had to throttle fetching from their servers
   due to too-frequent queries.  Usually they throttle by the querying
   IP address or block.  Similar defenses will likely need to be
   deployed by geofeed file servers.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to register object identifiers for one content type in
   the "SMI Security for S/MIME CMS Content Type
   (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1)" registry as follows:

Appendix A.  Example

   This appendix provides an example, including a trust anchor, a CA
   certificate subordinate to the trust anchor, an end-entity
   certificate subordinate to the CA for signing the geofeed, and a
   detached signature.

   The trust anchor is represented by a self-signed certificate.  As
   usual in the RPKI, the trust anchor has authority over all IPv4
   address blocks, all IPv6 address blocks, and all AS numbers.

   The end-entity certificate is issued by the CA.  This certificate
   grants signature authority for one IPv4 address block (192.0.2.0/24).
   Signature authority for AS numbers is not needed for geofeed data
   signatures, so no AS numbers are included in the certificate.
