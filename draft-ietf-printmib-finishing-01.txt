Abstract

   This document defines a printer industry standard SNMP MIB for the
   management of printer finishing device subunits.  The finishing
   device subunits applicable to this MIB are an integral part of the
   Printer System.  This MIB does not apply to a Finisher Device that
   is external to a Printer System.

   The Finisher MIB is defined as an extension of the Printer MIB
   [PrtMIB] and it is expected that the information defined in this
   document will be incorporated into a future update of the Printer
   MIB.

1.  INTRODUCTION

   This document describes an SNMP Management Information Base (MIB) to
   provide for the management of in-line post-processing in a fashion
   that is currently provided for printers, using the Printer MIB
   [PrtMIB].  The Printer Finishing MIB includes the following features:

    - Provides the status of the finishing device.
    - Manages the features and configuration of the finishing device.
    - Enables and disables the finishing operations.
    - Allows unsolicited status from the finishing device.


1.1  Scope

   This document provides a robust set of finishing devices, features,
   and functions, based upon today's state of the art of in-line
   finishing.  Since finishing typically accompanies higher speed
   network printers and copiers, in contrast to simple desktop devices,
   no attempt is made to limit the scope to "bare minimum".  On the
   other hand, the Printer Finishing MIB does not duplicate the
   production mail preparation, custom insertion, franking, and reprints
   that are covered by the DMTF Large Mailing Operations standard [LMO].

   Information supplied by the Printer Finishing MIB may be utilized by
   printer and finisher management applications engaged in monitoring
   status and managing configuration, and also used by print and
   finishing submission applications which are engaged in:

INTERNET-DRAFT         Printer Finishing MIB              March 12, 1998




    - print-file-level finishing operations that are applied to a
      complete print file,

    - document-level finishing operations that are applied individually
      to each document in the print file,

    - document-level finishing operations that are applied to a selected
      document in the print file.

   Note that not all combinations of finishing operations are
   compatible.  Compatible combinations of finishing operations are
   device specific.


1.2  Rational

   The Printer MIB [PrtMIB] is now successfully deployed in a large
   segment of the network printer market.  SNMP and/or HTTP enabled
   printers and software management applications are growing in numbers.

   There is an increase in the availability of network printers and
   copiers that include in-line finishing operations.  Thus a well
   defined and ordered set of finishing objects is now necessary for
   printer management.

   The printer model defined in the Printer MIB includes finishing
   operations and the MIB was designed to later incorporate finisher
   objects or to be referenced by a future Finisher MIB.



2.  TERMINOLOGY

   Where appropriate, the Printer Finishing MIB will conform to the
   terminology, syntax, and semantics from the DMTF Large Mailing
   Operations standard [LMO], the Internet Printing Protocol [IPP],
   and/or the ISO Document Printing Application [DPA].

   Finisher Input:  An input tray on the finisher and not otherwise
   associated with the printer.  An example of a finisher input is a
   tray that holds finishing "inserts".

   Finisher Output:  The output of the finisher.  Because processing is
   in-line, the finisher outputs are a direct extension of the set of
   printer outputs.

   Finishing Operation Axis:  Defined by DPA as the axis to which some
   finishing operations are applied to or referenced from.  An example
   is the axis for a fold operation.

INTERNET-DRAFT         Printer Finishing MIB              March 12, 1998




   Finishing Axis Offset:  The offset from a finishing operation axis at
   which the finishing operation takes place or is applied.



3.  FINISHER SUBUNITS INTEGRATED INTO THE PRINTER MODEL:

   The Printer Finisher Device subunits receive media from one or more
   Printer Media Path subunits and deliver the media to one or more
   Printer Output subunits after the completion of the finishing
   operations.  The Printer Model, as described in the Printer MIB
   [PRTMIB], is modified adding the finisher subunit(s) and finisher
   supplies as follows:

4.  THE ATTRIBUTE MECHANISM

   Attributes provide a function similar to information objects, except
   that attributes are identified by an enum, instead of an OID.  Thus
   new attributes may be registered without requiring a change to the
   MIB.  In addition, an implementation that does not have the
   functionality represented by the attribute can omit the attribute
   entirely, rather than having to return a distinguished value.  The
   agent is free to materialize an attribute in the Attribute Table as
   soon as the agent is aware of the value of the attribute.




Bergman, Lewis               Informational                     [page 4]
INTERNET-DRAFT         Printer Finishing MIB              March 12, 1998





   The agent materializes finishing subunit attributes in a four-indexed
   finDeviceAttributeTable:

     1. hrDeviceIndex - which device in the host

     2. finDeviceIndex - which finisher subunit in the printer device

     3. finDeviceAttributeTypeIndex - which attribute

     4. finDeviceAttributeInstanceIndex - which attribute instance for
        those attributes that can have multiple values per finishing
        subunit.


4.1  Conformance of Attribute Implementation

   An agent SHALL implement any attribute if (1) the device supports the
   functionality represented by the attribute and (2) the information is
   available to the agent.  The agent MAY create the attribute row in
   the finDeviceAttributeTable when the information is available or MAY
   create the row earlier with the designated 'unknown' value
   appropriate for that attribute.  See next section.

   If the device does not implement or does not provide access to the
   information about an attribute, the agent SHOULD NOT create the
   corresponding row in the finDeviceAttributeTable.


4.2  Useful, 'Unknown', and 'Other' Values for Objects and Attributes

   Some attributes have a 'useful' Integer32 value, some have a 'useful'
   OCTET STRING value, some MAY have either or both depending on
   implementation, and some MUST have both.  See the
   finDeviceAttributeTypeTC textual convention for the specification of
   each attribute.

   SNMP requires that if an object cannot be implemented because its
   values cannot be accessed, then a compliant agent SHALL return an
   SNMP error in SNMPv1 or an exception value in SNMPv2.  However, this
   MIB has been designed so that 'all' objects can and SHALL be
   implemented by an agent, so that neither the SNMPv1 error nor the
   SNMPv2 exception value SHALL be generated by the agent.  This MIB has
   also been designed so that when an agent materializes an attribute,
   the agent SHALL materialize a row consisting of both the
   finDeviceAttributeValueAsInteger and
   finDeviceAttributeValueAsOctets objects.

   In general, values for objects and attributes have been chosen so
   that a management application will be able to determine whether a
   'useful', 'unknown', or 'other' value is available.  When a useful




Bergman, Lewis               Informational                     [page 5]
INTERNET-DRAFT         Printer Finishing MIB              March 12, 1998




   value is not available for an object that agent SHALL return a zero-
   length string for octet strings, the value 'unknown(2)' for enums, a
   '0' value for an object that represents an index in another table,
   and a value '-2' for counting integers.

   Since each attribute is represented by a row consisting of both the
   finDeviceAttributeValueAsInteger and finDeviceAttributeValueAsOctets
   MANDATORY objects, SNMP requires that the agent SHALL always create
   an attribute row with both objects specified.  However, for most
   attributes the agent SHALL return a "useful" value for one of the
   objects and SHALL return the 'other' value for the other object.  For
   integer only attributes, the agent SHALL always return a zero-length
   string value for the finDeviceAttributeValueAsOctets object.  For
   octet string only attributes, the agent SHALL always return a '-1'
   value for the finDeviceAttributeValueAsInteger object.


4.3  Data Sub-types and Attribute Naming Conventions

   Many attributes are sub-typed to give a more specific data type than
   Integer32 or OCTET STRING.  The data sub-type of each attribute is
   indicated on the first line(s) of the description.  Some attributes
   have several different data sub-type representations.  When an
   attribute has both an Integer32 data sub-type and an OCTET STRING
   data sub-type, the attribute can be represented in a single row in
   the finDeviceAttributeTable.  In this case, the data sub-type name is
   not included as the last part of the name of the attribute.  When the
   data sub-types cannot be represented by a single row in the
   finDeviceAttributeTable, each such representation is considered a
   separate attribute and is assigned a separate name and enum value.
   For these attributes, the name of the data sub-type is the last part
   of the name of the attribute.


4.4  Single-Value (Row) Versus Multi-Value (MULTI-ROW) Attributes

   Most attributes SHALL have only one row per finishing subunit.
   However, a few attributes can have multiple values per finishing
   subunit, where each value is a separate row in the
   finDeviceAttributeTable.  Unless indicated with 'MULTI-ROW:' in the
   finDeviceAttributeTypeTC description, an agent SHALL ensure that each
   attribute occurs only once in the finDeviceAttributeTable for a
   finishing subunit.  Most of the 'MULTI-ROW' attributes do not allow
   duplicate values, i.e., the agent SHALL ensure that each value occurs
   only once for a finishing subunit.  Only if the specification of the
   'MULTI-ROW' attribute also says "There is no restriction on the same
   xxx occurring in multiple rows" can the agent allow duplicate values
   to occur for a single finishing subunit.

INTERNET-DRAFT         Printer Finishing MIB              March 12, 1998




4.5  Linked MUTI-ROW Values

   Some MULTI-ROW attributes are intended to go together.  Thus a set
   of value instances represent a single instance.  For example, the
   puncher attributes indicate the shape, maximum size, minimum size
   and shape of the various holes that the puncher can produce.  So the
   first set of values could represent one kind of hole, and the second
   set another kind of hole, etc.


4.6  Index Value Attributes

   A number of attributes are indexes in other tables.  Such attribute
   names end with the word 'Index'.  If the agent has not (yet) assigned
   an index value for a particular index attribute for a finishing
   subunit, the agent SHALL either: (1) return the value 0 or (2) not
   add this attribute to the finDeviceAttributeTable until the index
   value is assigned.  In the interests of brevity, the semantics for 0
   is specified once here and is not repeated for each index attribute
   specification and a DEFVAL of 0 is indicated.

7.  SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

   The Finisher MIB specifies a database and not necessarily a protocol
   for accessing the database. With regards to the security of the
   information within the database, it is anticipated that the primary
   vehicle for accessing this data will be through the use of the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP Version 1 has known security
   vulnerabilities due to the fact that only a "clear text" community




Bergman, Lewis               Informational                     [page 28]

   name is used for accessing MIB objects within a particular entity.
   SNMPv2 attempted to provide additional security features but is still
   not considered to be an adequate solution.  SNMP Version 3 provides
   much more robust security mechanisms with regards to with support
   authentication, as well as privacy.
