Abstract
   This memo describes a routing architecture that is most applicable to
   Customer Edge (CE)-based Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

   In this architecture, customer devices use BGP to exchange VPN routes
   with one another. The BGP UPDATES include a new attribute that
   identifies the endpoint of a tunnel that can be used to reach a
   particular VPN prefix.  The encapsulation strategy described in this
   memo is more flexible than that described in RFC 4364. In this
   architecture, the edge router can encapsulate the original datagram
   twice, as in RFC 4364. In this case, the inner header provides VPN
   context and the outer header identifies the tunnel between edge
   routers. Alternatively, the edge router can encapsulate the original
   datagram only once, with the tunnel providing both VPN context and
   identifying a tunnel to the remote edge router.

Internet-Draft    draft-berger-l3vpn-ip-tunnels-01.txt  October 24, 2007


1. Introduction

   [RFC4110] provides a taxonomy for Layer 3 Virtual Private Networks
   (VPNs). All VPNs share the following characteristics:

     - Customer enclaves are connected to a Service Provider (SP)
       network
     - Customer enclaves are assigned to a Virtual Routing and
       Forwarding (VRF) Instance
     - Customers can communicate within the VRF
     - Customers cannot communicate across VRF boundaries
     - Addressing is unique only within the VRF
     - VPN routing environments are isolated from one another
     - VPN routing environments are isolated from the service provider
       routing environment
     - Tunnels (MPLS, GRE, IPSec) connect customer enclaves to one
       another across the SP network

   [RFC4110] divides VPNs into two classes. These are:

     - Provider Edge (PE)-based VPNs
     - Customer Edge (CE)-based VPNs

   In a PE-based VPN, SP tunnels connect PE routers to one another.
   BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, see [RFC4364] and [RFC4659], leverages this
   architecture, using BGP to exchange VPN routes among PE routers. The
   BGP advertisements specify tunnel endpoint as the BGP next-hop for
   the VPN route. Therefore, SP interior routers need not carry VPN
   routes.

   In a CE-based VPN, tunnels connect CE routers to one another.
   Therefore, the routing architecture used in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs is not
   applicable. BGP/MPLS IP VPNs are also not applicable when MPLS is not
   supported. This memo describes a routing architecture similar to the
   routing architecture used in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs that is applicable to
   CE-based VPNs. We refer to the approach described in this document as
   "BGP/IP VPNs".

   In this architecture, customer devices use BGP to exchange VPN routes
   with one another. The BGP UPDATES include a new attribute that
   identifies the endpoint of a tunnel that can be used to reach a
   particular VPN prefix.

   The encapsulation strategy described in this memo is more flexible
   than that used in BGP/MPLS IP VPNs. In this architecture, the CE
   router can encapsulate the original datagram twice, as in BGP/MPLS IP
   VPNs. In this case, the inner header provides VPN context and the
   outer header identifies the tunnel between CE routers. Alternatively,

Internet-Draft    draft-berger-l3vpn-ip-tunnels-01.txt  October 24, 2007


   the CE router can encapsulate the original datagram only once, with
   the tunnel providing both VPN context and identifying a tunnel to the
   remote CE.


1.1. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2. VPN Route Distribution

   BGP/IP VPNs use much the same mechanisms as [RFC4364] and [RFC4659]
   to support VPN route distribution.  The specific mechanism differs
   only in that no MPLS labels are required.  This Section is modeled
   after Section 4 of [RFC4364] and Section 3 of [RFC4659] and borrows
   from those sources.


2.1. Address Families

   This document reuses the VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 address families
   specified in [RFC4364] and [RFC4659].  Different BGP encoding is used
   for these families as MPLS labels are not used.  This document adds
   the prefix "IP" to the names of the address families, i.e., "IP VPN-
   IPv4" and "IP VPN-IPv6", to identify the different encoding.


2.2. IP VPN-IPv4 NLRI and IP VPN-IPv6 NLRI Encoding

   As with BGP/MPLS IP VPNs, BGP/IP VPN information is carried in the
   Multiprotocol Reachable and Unreachable Network Layer Reachability
   Information (NLRIs) introduced in [RFC4760].  Unlike BGP/MPLS IP
   VPNs, the BGP/IP VPN encoding of the VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 address
   families provide tunnel related information (rather than MPLS
   labels).  This difference is reflected in the use of new formats in
   the "Network Address of Next Hop" and "Network Layer Reachability
   Information" NLRI fields.  In all other respects, including
   formatting and processing, BGP/IP VPN route distribution is identical
   to BGP/MPLS VPN route distribution.  This includes the encoding of
   the Route Distinguishers (RD) in prefixes and Route Target (RT)
   Attributes in extended communities.

   The use of BGP/IP VPN related NLRI formats is indicated by the SAFI
   value TBA (by IANA).  The address family of a VPN route determines
   the type of IP VPN NLRI which, as typical, is indicated by the AFI.



Berger, Bonica and White     Standards Track                    [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    draft-berger-l3vpn-ip-tunnels-01.txt  October 24, 2007


   IPv4 VPN routes MUST be encoded in an IP VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an AFI of
   1. IPv6 VPN routes MUST be encoded in an IP VPN-IPv6 NLRI with an AFI
   of 2.  With the exception of the "Network Address of Next Hop" and
   "Network Layer Reachability Information" NLRI fields, both types of
   NLRIs MUST be encoded as defined in [RFC4364] (for the IP VPN-IPv4
   NLRI) and in [RFC4659] (for the IP VPN-IPv4 NLRI).


2.2.1. BGP/IP VPN - Network Address of Next Hop

   With IP VPN NLRIs, the Network Address of Next Hop NLRI field carries
   the IP address and related tunnel parameters that should be used to
   reach a particular VPN route.  The IP address is the address to be
   used by receiving routers as the destination tunnel end-point
   address.  Tunnel parameters indicate the type of tunnel supported by
   the advertising router for the particular route.  Tunnel parameters
   may optionally indicate tunnel specific information, e.g, destination
   port or other tunnel identifying information.  The format of the
   Network Address of Next Hop field used in BGP/IP VPN route
   distribution is:

      +---------------------------+
      | Tunnel Flags (1 octet)    |
      +---------------------------+
      | Tunnel Type (1 octet)     |
      +---------------------------+
      | Tunnel Address (variable) |
      +---------------------------+
      | Tunnel Params. (variable) |
      +---------------------------+

   The use and meaning of these fields are as follows:

      Tunnel Flags: (Bit Field)

         The following flags are defined:

             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |V|  Reserved   |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         Version (V):

            The Version bit is used to indicate the IP version of the
            Tunnel Address field.  The flag MUST be cleared, i.e., zero
            (0), when the tunnel end-point address carried in the Tunnel
            Address field is an IPv4 address.  The flag MUST be set,

Internet-Draft    draft-berger-l3vpn-ip-tunnels-01.txt  October 24, 2007


            i.e., one (1), when the Tunnel Address field carries an IPv6
            address.

      Tunnel Type: (Unsigned Integer)

         This field indicates the type of tunnel that should be used to
         transport data associated with the advertised VPN route.  Note
         that the mechanisms related to establishment and management of
         tunnels are outside the scope of this document.  The following
         Type values are defined:

         Value   Type
         -----   ----------------------------------------
             0   Reserved
             1   Generic Route Encapsulation (GRE) [RFC1701]
             2   IP-in-IP [RFC2003]
             3   IP Authentication Header in the Tunnel-mode (AH)
                 [RFC4301]
             4   IP Encapsulating Security Payload in the Tunnel-mode
                 (ESP) [RFC4303]
             5   Reserved (contact authors)

      Tunnel Address:

         The Tunnel Address field contains the destination tunnel end-
         point IP address that SHOULD be used to reach the advertised
         VPN route.  The type of address and the size of the field can
         be determined by examining the V-bit.  When the V-bit is not
         set, i.e., zero (0), the Tunnel Address field MUST contain a
         4-octet IPv4 address.  When the V-bit is set, i.e., one (1),
         the Tunnel Address field MUST contain a 16-octet IPv6 address.

      Tunnel Parameters:

         The Tunnel Parameters field contains a series of variable-
         length data items called Tunnel Parameter, or TP, subobjects.
         Each TP subobject has the following format:

            +---------------------------+
            |   TP Type (1 octet)       |
            +---------------------------+
            |   TP Length (1 octet)     |
            +---------------------------+
            |   TP Contents (variable)  |
            +---------------------------+

         The use and meaning of these fields are as follows:

Internet-Draft    draft-berger-l3vpn-ip-tunnels-01.txt  October 24, 2007


            Tunnel Parameter (TP) Type: (Unsigned Integer)

               This field indicates the type of tunnel parameters
               contained in the TP subobject. Two value ranges are
               defined.  The first range is used for parameters that are
               independent of any particular tunneling technology and
               are shared across all Tunnel Type field values.  The
               second range is specific to, and only has meaning in the
               context of a particular Tunnel Type field values, i.e.,
               identified by the tuple <Tunnel Type, TP Type>.  The
               value ranges are as followed:

                   Range   Use
                  -------  ----------------------------------------
                    0-63   Common tunnel parameters (Applies to all
                           Tunnel Types)
                   64-127  Tunnel Type (technology) specific tunnel
                           parameters
                  128-255  Reserved

               TP Type one (1) is defined below in Section 2.2.1.1.

            Tunnel Parameter (TP) Length: (Unsigned Integer)

               The TP Length field contains of the total length of the
               tunnel parameters subobject in octets, including the TP
               Type and TP Length fields.  The TP Length field MUST be
               equal to or greater than 2.

            Tunnel Parameter (TP) Contents:

               The actual information carried in the subobject.

         Subobjects with TP subobject types that are not recognized by a
         receiver SHOULD be silently ignored.


2.2.1.1. Alternate Address Tunnel Parameter (AA-TP) Subobject

   The Alternate Address Tunnel Parameter (AA-TP) Subobject is used to
   provide an additional destination tunnel end-point IP address.  When
   this subobject is present, the address provided in the subobject
   along with the address provided in the next hop Tunnel Address field
   and any other AA-TP Subobjects SHOULD be used as "equal cost" next
   hops.  Multiple AA-TP Subobjects MAY be included in a NLRI Next Hop.
   The format of the AA-TP Subobject is:





Berger, Bonica and White     Standards Track                    [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    draft-berger-l3vpn-ip-tunnels-01.txt  October 24, 2007


      +---------------------------+
      |   TP Type (=1)            |
      +---------------------------+
      |   TP Length (=6 or =18)   |
      +---------------------------+
      |   AA (variable)           |
      +---------------------------+

   The use and meaning of these fields are as follows:

      TP Type:

         The AA-TP Subobject may be used with any type of tunnel and
         MUST use the TP Type of 1.

      TP Length:

         Per the definition of TP Length, see above, this field is set
         to the length of the AA field in octets plus 2.  TP Length MUST
         be set to 6 when the V bit is not set, i.e. zero (0), and MUST
         be set to 18 when the V bit is set, i.e., one (1).

      Alternate Address (AA):

         The Alternate Address (AA) field contains an address of the
         type identified by the V bits in the Tunnel Flags field.  The
         field MUST contain an IPv4 address when the V bit is not set
         (0), and an IPv6 address when the V bit is set (1).


2.2.2. BGP/IP VPN Prefix Information

   BGP/IP VPN Prefix Information parallels the label mapping information
   used in BGP/MPLS VPNs, and the general definition and processing of
   BGP/IP VPN Prefix Information follows [RFC3107].  As with label
   mapping information tunnel, BGP/IP VPN Prefix Information is carried
   as part of an NLRI in the Multiprotocol Extensions attributes.


2.2.2.1. BGP/IP VPN Prefix Route Information Encoding

   The Network Layer Reachability information is encoded as one or more
   triples of the form <length, next hop token, prefix>.  The Next Hop
   Token corresponds to the Network Address of Next Hop field of the
   NRLI.  Prefix contains the reachable VPN route.  When a router
   advertises the same Prefix with multiple NLRI Next Hop fields, the
   advertiser uses different Next Hop Tokens for each next hop.  This
   allows the router to independently withdraw each advertised route.



Berger, Bonica and White     Standards Track                    [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    draft-berger-l3vpn-ip-tunnels-01.txt  October 24, 2007


   The format of the BGP/IP VPN Prefix Route Information is:

      +---------------------------+
      |   Length (1 octet)        |
      +---------------------------+
      |   NH Token (1 octet)      |
      +---------------------------+
      |   Prefix (variable)       |
      +---------------------------+

   The use and meaning of these fields are as follows:

      Length: (Unsigned Integer)

         The Length field indicates the length in bits of the address
         prefix.  The size of the Length and NH Token fields MUST NOT be
         included.

      Next Hop (NH) Token: (Unsigned Integer)

         An identifier that within the scope of the advertising router
         uniquely identifies the contents of the Network Address of Next
         Hop field associated with this route.  All routes advertised
         with the same Next Hop field SHOULD have the same NH Token
         value.  Routes advertised with different Next Hop field values
         MUST have different value NH Tokens. Note, zero (0) is a valid
         NH Token field value.

      Prefix:

         This field contains the IP VPN prefix that is being advertised.
         Both unicast and multicast prefixes MAY be carried in this
         field.

         The format of this field is the same as defined in [RFC4364].
         The [RFC4364] definition is based on the following definition
         from [RFC3107]: "The Prefix field contains address prefixes
         followed by enough trailing bits to make the end of the field
         fall on an octet boundary.  Note that the value of trailing
         bits is irrelevant."  Additionally, per [RFC4364], the Prefix
         field includes an 8 octet RD.

         The length of the Prefix field can be determined by examining
         the V-bit.  When the V-bit is not set, i.e., zero (0), the
         Prefix field is a 12 octet quantity which MUST contain an
         8-octet RD followed by a 4-octet IPv4 address.  When the V-bit
         is set, i.e., one (1), the Prefix field is a 24-octet quantity
         which MUST contain an 8-octet RD followed by a 16-octet IPv6

         address.


2.2.2.2. Advertising Multiple Routes to a Destination

   A BGP speaker may maintain (and advertise to its peers) more than one
   route to a given destination.  Each of these routes can be advertised
   using separate NLRIs with different Network Address of Next Hops, or
   via the AA-TP Subobject defined above in Section 2.2.1.1.  When
   routes are advertised with different NLRI Next Hops, the routes will
   have different NH Tokens.  Routes, with independent NH Tokens, may be
   independently withdrawn.  When the AA-TP Subobject is used, all next
   hops included in the same advertisement will share the same NLRI Next
   Hop field and will be covered under the same NH Token and, therefore,
   can only be withdrawn as a group.


2.3. BGP Capability Negotiation

   In order for two edge routers to exchange IP VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6
   NLRIs, they MUST use BGP Capabilities Negotiation to ensure that they
   both are capable of properly processing such NLRIs.  This is done as
   specified in [RFC4760] and [RFC3392], by using capability code 1
   (multiprotocol BGP), with AFI and SAFI values as specified above,
   Section 2.2.1 and 2.2.2.


3. Forwarding

   This Section is modeled after Section 5 of [RFC4364] and Section 4 of
   [RFC4659] and borrows from those sources.

   When an edge router receives an IP packet from a CE device, the edge
   router MUST choose a particular VRF in which to look up the packet's
   destination address.  This choice is typically based on the packet's
   ingress attachment circuit.  The router MUST then look for a best
   match for the packet's destination IP address within the VRF.

   If the packet's next hop is reached directly over a VRF attachment
   circuit (see definition in [RFC4364]) from the processing edge router
   (i.e., the packet's egress attachment circuit is on the same edge
   router as its ingress attachment circuit), then the packet MUST be
   sent on the egress attachment circuit.

   If the ingress and egress attachment circuits are on the same edge
   router, but are associated with different VRFs, and if the route that
   best matches the destination address in the ingress attachment
   circuit's VRF is an aggregate of several routes in the egress



Berger, Bonica and White     Standards Track                   [Page 10]

Internet-Draft    draft-berger-l3vpn-ip-tunnels-01.txt  October 24, 2007


   attachment circuit's VRF, it may be necessary to look up the packet's
   destination address in the egress VRF as well.

   If the packet's next hop is NOT reached through a VRF attachment
   circuit, then the packet must travel at least one hop through the
   backbone.  The packet thus has a "BGP VPN Next Hop", which will have
   been advertised per Section 2.2.  The packet must then be tunneled to
   the BGP VPN Next Hop.

   The packet MUST be encapsulated in a tunnel according to the type
   specified in the NLRI Next Hop of the advertised route.  The
   encapsulated packet MUST then be forwarded as a standard IP packet.
   As previously mentioned, the specifics of tunnel establishment are
   outside the scope of this document.

   When the packet arrives at the destination tunnel end-point, it will
   be at the BGP VPN Next Hop.  The BGP VPN Next Hop MUST strip the
   tunnel encapsulation, and MUST identify how the received packet is to
   be forwarded.  The tunnel destination address will typically indicate
   the outgoing VRF.  In this case, the packet's original IP destination
   address MUST be looked up in a particular VRF before being forwarded
   to a CE device.  In other cases, the tunnel's destination address
   will determine the packet's egress attachment circuit.  In this case,
   a lookup (e.g., ARP) may still need to be done in order to determine
   the packet's data link header on that attachment circuit.


4. Security Considerations

   This section borrows from Section 11 of [RFC4659].  The extensions
   defined in this document allow [RFC4271] to propagate reachability
   information about IPv4 and IPv6 VPN routes.  Propagation of VPN
   routes within BGP is already defined in [RFC4364] and [RFC4659].

   Security considerations for the transport of IPv4 and IPv6
   reachability information using BGP are discussed in [RFC4271] and
   [RFC2545], respectively, and are equally applicable for the
   extensions described in this document.

   The extensions described in this document for offering VPNs over IP
   tunnels use the same BGP based route distribution approach as the
   approach described in [RFC4364] and [RFC4659].  Therefore, the same
   security considerations apply with regards to Control Plane security,
   and edge router and P device security as described in [RFC4364],
   Section 13.

   This document uses IP based tunnel technologies to support data plane
   transport.  Consequently, the security considerations of those tunnel

   technologies apply.  This document defines support for GRE [RFC1701],
   IP-in-IP [RFC2003] and IPsec AH [RFC4301] and ESP [RFC4303].  The
   security considerations from those documents apply to the data plane
   aspects of this document.


5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to administer assignment of new namespaces and new
   values for namespaces defined in this document and reviewed in this
   section.


5.1. BGP/IP VPN SAFI

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will make the assignment in
   the Subsequence Address Family Identifiers (SAFI) registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/safi-namespace:

   Value    Description                                     Reference
   -----    -----------                                     ---------
   141*     BGP/IP VPN address                        [This document]

   (*) Suggested value.


5.2. BGP/IP VPN Tunnel Types

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will establish a new
   registry called the "BGP/IP VPN Tunnel Types registry".  This
   registry should be established with the following initial values.

      Value   Type
      -----   ----------------------------------------
          0   Reserved
          1   Generic Route Encapsulation (GRE) [RFC1701]
          2   IP-in-IP [RFC2003]
          3   IP Authentication Header in the Tunnel-mode (AH)
              [RFC4301]
          4   IP Encapsulating Security Payload in the Tunnel-mode
              (ESP) [RFC4303]
          5   Reserved

   Future assignments are to be made using either the IETF Consensus
   process defined in [RFC2434], or the Early IANA Allocation process
   defined in [RFC4020]. Reserved values MUST NOT be reassigned without
   permission of the authors of this document.

5.3. BGP/IP VPN Tunnel Parameter Subobject Types

   Upon approval of this document, the IANA will establish a new
   registry called the "BGP/IP VPN Tunnel Parameter Subobject Types
   registry".  The assignable values are broken down into the following
   ranges:

       Range   Use
      -------  ------------------------------------------------------
        0-63   Common tunnel parameters (Applies to all Tunnel Types)
       64-127  Tunnel Type (technology) specific tunnel parameters
      128-255  Reserved

   This registry should be established with the following initial
   values:

      Value   Tunnel Parameter (TP) Type
      -----   --------------------------------------------
          0   Reserved
          1   Alternate Address Tunnel Parameter Subobject

   Assignments in the range of 64-127 MUST be made in the context of a
   particular BGP/IP VPN Tunnel Type, see Section 5.3, i.e., assignments
   take the form of <Tunnel Type, TP Type>.

   Future assignments in the range of 0-127 are to be made using either
   the IETF Consensus process defined in [RFC2434], or the Early IANA
   Allocation process defined in [RFC4020].  Assignments in the range of
   128-255 require Standards Action, which may impact how subsequent
   allocations within this range are to be made.
