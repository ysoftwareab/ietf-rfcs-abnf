Abstract

   This draft presents a LDAP schema for the DMTF CIM System model [5].

1. Introduction

   This draft presents a LDAPv3 [1,2] schema for the DMTF CIM System
   model.  It builds on the core model presented in [3].  Associations
   are mapped using a combination of auxiliary classes and DIT structure
   rules.  Where auxiliary classes are used, name form and DIT content
   rules are specified.

   This document is not a product of the DMTF, and represents the view
   of the authors.

2. LDAP Mapping Considerations

2.1 Differences Between this Mapping and the CIM System Model

   Several classes have attributes removed because they do not make
   sense for the directory to store: LocalDateTime, NumberOfUsers,
   NumberOfProcesses, TotalSwapSpaceSize, TotalVirtualMemorySize,
   FreeVirtualMemory, FreePhysicalMemory, TotalVisibleMemorySize,
   SizeStoredInPagingFiles, and FreeSpaceInPagingFiles.  Further, a
   directory shouldn't store logicalfile information, including
   datafiles, directories, and devices shouldn't be stored Therefore the
   DeviceAccessedByFile, DirectoryContainsFile, Mount, Export, and
   FileStorage associations aren't included because referenced pieces
   are missing.

   A directory should not store either Process, Thread, Job, or
   JobDestination objects. Therefore the associations OSProcess,
   ProcessThread, ProcessExecutable, HostedJobDestination, and
   JobDestinationJobs aren't included either.

2.2 Changes to cimAssociationInstance

   The core mapping [3] defined cimAssociationInstance as a helper
   class.  To support the auxiliary classes, the following classes
   should be added to cimAssociationInstance's content rule:

      cim22ComponentCSAuxClass
      cim22SystemPartitionAuxClass
      cim22HostingCSAuxClass
      cim22ParticipatingCSAuxClass
      cim22ClusterServiceAccessBySAPAuxClass
      cim22BootServiceAccessBySAPAuxClass
      cim22RunningOSAuxClass
      cim22OperatingSystemSoftwareFeatureAuxClass
      cim22BootOSFromFSAuxClass
      cim22BIOSFeatureBIOSElementsAuxClass
      cim22SystemBIOSAuxClass

   Also, the following structure rules defined here need to be added to
   the structure rule for cimAssociationInstance:  <sr29>, <sr30>,
   <sr31>.

2.3 cimCharacteristicsInstance

   The class cimBIOSFeature defines two linked indexed arrays:
   Characteristics and CharacteristicDescriptions.  In the LDAP mapping,
   these are replaced with separate instances of
   cimCharacteristicsInstance, DIT contained by cimBIOSFeature.

3. Class Definitions

   For efficiency in the LDAP representation, associations are specified
   as a combination of auxiliary classes and DIT structure rules.
   Attribute definitions for each class are presented with the object
   class.  Other definitions are also provided when necessary.

   This approach minimizes the number of DN pointers stored in the
   schema, but some pointer dereferencing is necessary.  While not
   explicitly stated in the definitions below, we assume that all
   attributes with DN support the matching rule defined in [4].
   Attribute names for DN pointers also follow the convention that a
   single pointer's name ends in "Ref", while an array of pointers' name

   ends in "Refs".

   Note: all attribute, object class, and name form OIDs are place
   holders, and syntax OIDs in definitions have been replaced by names
   for clarity.

3.1 cim22ComponentCSAuxClass

   A ComputerSystem can aggregate another ComputerSystem. This
   association can be used to model MPP Systems with workstation
   frontends, an I2O subsystem embedded in a UnitaryComputerSystem, or a
   System that splits functionality between two processors, potentially
   running different OperatingSystems. For example, if a CISC Processor
   and its associated OperatingSystem, are used for user interface and
   file support, and a RISC Processor and its OS are used for complex
   mathematical operations, this could be modeled as two ComputerSystems
   where one aggregates the other. Sometimes, this could be modeled as a
   Cluster. The difference is the focus of the relationship. ComponentCS
   represents that unique and distinct ComputerSystems are aggregated by
   a higher level CS object. However, each of the component CSs are
   still distinguishable entities and are only viewed as such.
   Alternately, with a Cluster, the ComputerSystems that participate in
   it are inconsequential, when viewed through the 'Cluster System'.

   When instantiating or subclassing the ComponentCS relationship, care
   should be taken that the component ComputerSystem meets the
   definitional requirements of a ComputerSystem - ie, a functional
   whole that provides compute capabilities and aggregates System
   Devices, an OperatingSystem, etc.
