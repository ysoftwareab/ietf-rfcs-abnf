<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>This document describes a Home Agent assisted Route Optimization
      functionality to IPv4 Network Mobility Protocol. The function is
      designed to facilitate optimal routing in cases where all nodes are
      connected to a single Home Agent, thus the use case is Route
      Optimization within single organization or similar entity. The
      functionality adds possibility to discover eligible peer nodes based on
      information received from Home Agent, Network Prefixes they represent,
      and how to establish direct tunnel between such nodes.

Introduction and motivations</h3>

<p>Traditionally, there has been no method for route optimization in
      <a class='info' href='#RFC3344'>Mobile IPv4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Perkins, C., &ldquo;IP Mobility Support for IPv4,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3344] apart from an early attempt
      <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-mobileip-optim'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;mobileip&#8209;optim]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Perkins, C. and D. Johnson, &ldquo;Route Optimization in Mobile IP,&rdquo; September&nbsp;2001.</span><span>)</span></a>. Unlike <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>Mobile IPv6<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3775], where Route Optimization has been
      included from the start, with Mobile IPv4 route optimization hasn't been
      addressed in a generalized scope.
</p>
<p>Even though general route optimization may not be of interest in the
      scope of IPv4, there are still specific applications for Route
      Optimization in Mobile IPv4. This draft proposes method to optimize
      routes between networks behind mobile routers, as defined by <a class='info' href='#RFC5177'>NEMO<span> (</span><span class='info'>Leung, K., Dommety, G., Narayanan, V., and A. Petrescu, &ldquo;Network Mobility (NEMO) Extensions for Mobile IPv4,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5177].
</p>
<p>A particular use case concerns setting up redundant yet economical
      enterprise networks. Recently, a trend has emerged where customers
      prefer to maintain connectivity via multiple service providers. Reasons
      include redundancy, reliability and availability issues. These kinds of
      multi-homing scenarios have traditionally been solved by using such
      technologies as multihoming BGP. However, a more lightweight and
      economical solution is desirable.
</p>
<p>From service provider perspective a common topology for enterprise
      customer network consists of one to several sites (typically
      headquarters and various branch offices). These sites are typically
      connected via various Layer 2 technologies (ATM or Frame relay PVCs),
      MPLS VPNs or Layer 3 site-to-site VPNs. With a Service Level Agreement,
      a customer can obtain a very reliable and well supported intranet
      connectivity. However, compared to the cost of "consumer-grade"
      broadband Internet access the SLA-guaranteed version can be considered
      very expensive. These consumer-grade options however, are not reliable
      approach for mission-critical applications.
</p>
<p>Mobile IP, especially mobile routers, can be used to improve
      reliability of connectivity even when implemented over consumer-grade
      Internet access. The customer becomes a client for a virtual service
      provider, which does not take part in the actual access technology. The
      service provider has a backend system and an IP address pool that it
      distributes to customers. Access is provided by multiple, independent,
      possibly consumer-grade ISPs, with Mobile IP providing seamless
      handovers if service from a specific ISP fails. The drawback of this
      solution is that it creates a star topology; All Mobile IP tunnels end
      up at the service provider hosted home agent, causing heavy load at the
      backend. Route Optimization between mobile networks addresses this
      issue, by taking network load off the home agent and the backend.
</p>
<p>An example network is pictured below:

<p>In this example case, organization network consists of two sites,
      that are connected via 2 ISPs for redundancy reasons. Mobile IP allows
      fast handovers without problems of multi-homing and BGP peering between
      each individual ISP and the organization. The traffic however takes a
      non-optimal route through the virtual operator backend.
</p>
<p>Route optimization addresses this issue, allowing traffic between
      Sites A and B to flow through ISP B's network, or in case of a link
      failure, via the ISP peering point (such as MAE-WEST). The backend will
      not suffer from heavy loads.
</p>
<p>The primary design goal is to limit the load to the backend to
      minimum. Additional design goals include extensibility to a more
      generalized scope, beyond the need of a single, coordinating Home
      Agent.

Mobile IPv4 route optimization between mobile networks</h3>

<p>This section describes the changed functionality of Home Agent and
      Mobile Router compared to the base NEMOv4 operation defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC5177'>NEMO-base<span> (</span><span class='info'>Leung, K., Dommety, G., Narayanan, V., and A. Petrescu, &ldquo;Network Mobility (NEMO) Extensions for Mobile IPv4,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC5177]. The basic premise is still the same;
      Mobile Routers, when registering to the Home Agent, either inform the
      Home Agent of the mobile network prefixes they are managing (explicit
      mode) or get prefixes assigned by Home Agent (implicit mode). However,
      instead of prefix information only remaining on the Home Agent and the
      Mobile Router managing the prefixes, this information will now be
      distributed to the other Mobile Routers as well.
</p>
<p>The Home Agent-assisted route optimization is primarily intended for
      helping to optimize traffic patterns between multiple sites in an single
      organization or administrative domain; However, extranets can also be
      reached with optimized routes, as long as all Mobile Routers connect to
      the same Home Agent. The procedure aim to maintain backwards
      compatibility; With legacy nodes or routers full connectivity is always
      preserved even though optimal routing cannot be guaranteed.
</p>
<p>The schema requires a Mobile Router to be able to receive messages
      from Home Agent and other Mobile Routers unsolicited - that is, without
      first initiating a request. This behavior is similar to the <a class='info' href='#RFC3543'>registration revocation procedure<span> (</span><span class='info'>Glass, S. and M. Chandra, &ldquo;Registration Revocation in Mobile IPv4,&rdquo; August&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3543]. Many of the
      mechanisms are same - including the fact that advertising route
      optimization support upon registration implies capability to receive
      registration requests and return routability messages from other Mobile
      Routers.
</p>
<p>Compared to IPv6, where Mobile Node &lt;-&gt; Correspondent node
      bindings are maintained via Mobility Routing header and Home Address
      options, Mobile IPv4 always requires the use of tunnels. Therefore,
      inter-mobile-router tunnel establishment has to be conducted.

<a name="rfc.section.3.1"></a><h3>3.1.&nbsp;
Maintaining route optimization information</h3>

<p>During registration, a joining Mobile Router MAY request
        information on route-optimizable network prefixes. The Mobile Router
        MAY also allow redistribution of information on its managed network
        prefixes regardless whether they are explicit or implicit (statically
        configured or assigned by Home Agent). These are indicated with Mobile
        Router route optimization capability extension, see <a class='info' href='#MRROCAP'>Section&nbsp;5.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mobile router Route optimization capability</span><span>)</span></a>. If the Home Agent accepts the request for
        Route Optimization, this is indicated with <a class='info' href='#ROR'>Route
        Optimization Reply extension<span> (</span><span class='info'>Route optimization reply</span><span>)</span></a> in the registration reply.
</p>
<p>Note that the redistribution of network prefix information from the
        Home Agent happens only during the registration signaling. There are
        no "routing updates" from Home Agent except during re-registrations
        triggered by handovers, registration timeouts and specific
        solicitation. The solicitation re-registration MAY occur if a
        Correspondent Router receives a registration request from a unknown
        Mobile Router (see <a class='info' href='#INTERMOBILEREG'>Section&nbsp;3.3.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Inter-Mobile Router registration</span><span>)</span></a>).

<a name="rfc.section.3.1.1"></a><h3>3.1.1.&nbsp;
Advertising route-optimizable prefixes</h3>

<p>As noted, NEMO-supporting Home Agent already maintains, and in
          some cases assigns, information on which network prefixes are
          reachable behind certain Mobile Routers. Only change to this
          functionality is that this information can now be distributed to
          other Mobile Routers upon request. This request is defined in <a class='info' href='#MRROCAP'>Section&nbsp;5.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mobile router Route optimization capability</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>When a Home Agent receives a registration request, standard
          authentication and authorization procedures are conducted.
</p>
<p>If registration is successful and the route optimization request
          was present in the registration request, the reply message MUST
          include <a class='info' href='#ROR'>Route Optimization Reply extension<span> (</span><span class='info'>Route optimization reply</span><span>)</span></a>
          to indicate whether Route Optimization was accepted. Furthermore,
          the extension also informs Mobile Router if NAT was detected using
          the procedure in <a class='info' href='#RFC3519'>RFC 3519<span> (</span><span class='info'>Levkowetz, H. and S. Vaarala, &ldquo;Mobile IP Traversal of Network Address Translation (NAT) Devices,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3519], which is
          based on the discrepancy between requester's indicated Care-of
          address and packet's source address.
</p>
<p>The reply message MAY also include one route optimization prefix
          advertisement extension which informs the Mobile Router of existing
          mobile network prefixes and the Mobile Routers that manage them
          which have given redistribution permission. The networks SHOULD be
          included in order of priority, with the prefixes most desired to
          conduct optimization listed first. The extension is constructed as
          shown in <a class='info' href='#ROPREFIXAD'>Section&nbsp;5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Route optimization prefix advertisement</span><span>)</span></a>. The extension consists
          of a list where each Mobile Router, identified by Home Address, is
          listed with according prefix(es) and their respective realm(s).
</p>
<p>Each network prefix can be associated to a realm, usually in the
          form 'organization.example.com'. Besides the routers in customer's
          own organization, the prefix list may also include other Mobile
          Routers, e.g. Default prefix (0.0.0.0/0) pointing towards Internet
          gateway for Internet connectivity, and possible extranets. The realm
          information can be used to make policy decisions on the Mobile
          Router, such as preferring optimization within specific realm
          only.
</p>
<p>In a typical scenario where Network Prefixes are allocated to
          Mobile Routers connecting to a single Home Agent, the prefixes are
          usually either continuous or at least very close to each other. Due
          to these characteristics, a prefix compression mechanism is
          provided. Another compression scheme is in use for realm
          information, where realms often share same higher-level domains.
          These compression mechanisms are further explained in <a class='info' href='#compressionsformats'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Data compression schemes</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Upon receiving registration reply with the route optimization
          prefix advertisement extension, the Mobile Router SHALL insert the
          Mobile Router Home Addresses included in the extension as a
          host-prefixes to the local Route Optimization Cache if they do not
          already exist. If present, any additional prefixes information SHALL
          also be inserted to the Route Optimization Cache.
</p>
<p>The Mobile Router MAY discard entries from a desired starting
          point onwards, due to memory or other policy related constraints.
          The intention of listing the prefixes in order of priority is to
          provide implicit guidance for this decision. If the capacity of the
          device allows, the Mobile Router SHOULD use information on all
          advertised prefixes.

Return routability procedure</h3>

<p>The return routability procedure for Mobile IPv6 is described in
        <a class='info' href='#RFC3775'>[RFC3775]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Johnson, D., Perkins, C., and J. Arkko, &ldquo;Mobility Support in IPv6,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>. Same principles apply to the Mobile IPv4
        version: Two messages are sent to Correspondent Router's Home Address,
        one via Home Agent and the other directly from the Mobile Router CoA,
        with two responses coming through same routes. Registration management
        key is derived from token information carried on these messages. This
        registration management key (KRm) can then be used to authenticate
        registration requests (comparable to Binding Updates in Mobile
        IPv6).
</p>
<p>The Return Routability procedure is a method provided by Mobile IP
        protocol to establish the KRm in a relatively lightweight fashion. If
        desired, the KRms can be configured to Mobile Routers statically, or
        using an desired external secure key provisioning mechanism. If KRm's
        are known to the Mobile Routers via some other mechanism, Return
        Routability procedure can be skipped. Such provisioning mechanisms are
        out of scope for this document.
</p>
<p>Assumption on traffic patterns is that the Mobile Router that
        initiates the RR procedure can always send outbound messages, even
        when behind NAT or firewall. This basic assumption made for NAT
        Traversal in <a class='info' href='#RFC3519'>[RFC3519]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Levkowetz, H. and S. Vaarala, &ldquo;Mobile IP Traversal of Network Address Translation (NAT) Devices,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> is also applicable here. In
        case the Correspondent Router is behind such obstacles, it receives
        these messages via the reverse tunnel to CR's Home Address, thus any
        problem regarding the CR's connectivity is addressed during the
        registration phase.

Router keys</h3>

<p>Each Mobile Router maintains a 'correspondent router key', Kcr,
          which is not shared with anyone else. Kcr is used for authenticating
          peer Mobile Routers in the situation where mobile router is acting
          as a CR. This is analogous to node key, Kcn, in Mobile IPv6.
          Correspondent Router uses router key to verify that the keygen
          tokens sent by Mobile Router in registration request are its own.
          The router key MUST be a random number, 96 bits in length.

<a name="rfc.section.3.2.2"></a><h3>3.2.2.&nbsp;
Nonces</h3>

<p>Each Mobile Router also maintains one or more indexed nonces.
          Nonces should be generated periodically with a good random number
          generator. The Mobile Router may use same nonces with all Mobile
          Routers.
</p>
<p>Mobile Routers keep both the current nonce and small set of valid
          previous nonces whose lifetime have not expired yet.
</p>
<p>Return Routability procedure may be initiated only when the Route
        Optimization Cache's RRSTATE field for the Correspondent Router is
        INACTIVE. When Return Routability procedure is initiated, the state
        MUST be set to IN PROGRESS.
</p>
<p>The Return Routability procedure consists of four Mobile IP
        messages: Home Test Init, Care-of Test Init, Home Test and Care-of
        Test. They are constructed as shown in <a class='info' href='#HOTI'>Section&nbsp;5.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Home-Test Init message</span><span>)</span></a> through
        <a class='info' href='#CoT'>Section&nbsp;5.8<span> (</span><span class='info'>Care-of test message</span><span>)</span></a>. If the Mobile Router has included the Mobile
        Router optimization capability extension in its Registration Request,
        it MUST be able to accept Return Routability messages. The messages
        are delivered as normal Mobile IP signaling packets. The addresses are
        set to Correspondent Router's HoA and Mobile Router's CoA.
</p>
<p>The return routability procedure begins with the Mobile Router
        sending HoTI and CoTI messages, each containing a cookie.
</p>
<p>Upon receiving the HoTI or CoTI message the Correspondent Router
        MUST have a secret Kcr. If the Kcr does not exist, it must be produced
        before continuing with the return routability procedure.
</p>
<p>Correspondent Router responds to HoTI and CoTI messages by
        constructing HoT and CoT messages, respectively, as replies. HoT
        message contains current home nonce index and CoT message contains
        current care-of nonce index.
</p>
<p>Upon completion of Return Routability procedure, the Routing
        Optimization Cache's RRSTATE field is set to ACTIVE. The Mobile Router
        will establish a registration management key KRm:
</p>
<p>KRm = SHA1 (home keygen token | care-of keygen token)
</p>
<p>Like in Mobile IPv6, the Correspondent Router does not maintain any
        state for the Mobile Router until after receiving a registration
        request.

Mobile-Correspondent Router operations</h3>

<p>This section deals with the operation of Mobile and Correspondent
        Routers performing route optimization. Note that in the context of
        this draft all routers work as both Mobile Router and Correspondent
        Router. The term "Mobile Router" applies to the router initiating the
        Route Optimization procedure, and "Correspondent Router" indicates the
        peer router.
</p>
<p>Especially compared to Mobile IPv6 route optimization there are two
        issues that are different regarding IPv4. First of all, since Mobile
        IPv4 always uses tunnels, there must be a tunnel established between
        MR and CR's Care-of addresses. The Correspondent Router learns of
        Mobile Router's Care-of address as it is provided by the Registration
        Request. The Mobile Router learns Correspondent Router's Care-of
        address by a new extension, "Care-of Address", in registration reply.
        Second issue is rising from security standpoint: In a registration
        request, the Mobile Router claims to represent an arbitrary IPv4
        network. If the CR has not yet received this information (HoA
        &lt;-&gt; Network prefix), it SHOULD perform a re-registration to Home
        Agent to verify the claim.

Triggering Route Optimization</h3>

<p>Since each Mobile Router knows the eligible route-optimizable
          networks, the route optimization between all Correspondent Routers
          can be established at any time; However a better general practice is
          to conduct Route Optimization on-demand only. Route optimization
          SHOULD only be started when receiving a packet where destination
          address is local (and the subnet is registered as route optimizable)
          and source address exists in the network prefixes of Route
          Optimization Cache.

<a name="rfc.section.3.3.2"></a><h3>3.3.2.&nbsp;
Mobile Router routing tables</h3>

<p>Each Mobile Router maintains a routing table. In a typical
          situation, the Mobile Router has one or more interface(s) to the
          local networks, one or more interface(s) to wide-area networks (such
          as provided by ISPs), and a tunnel interface to the Home Agent.
          Additional tunnel interfaces become activated as Route Optimization
          is being performed.
</p>
<p>The routing table SHOULD typically contain Network Prefixes
          managed by Correspondent Routers associated with established
          route-optimized tunnel interfaces. In addition, host-routes to
          Correspondent Routers' Care-of addresses SHOULD be associated with
          the assigned to the physical interfaces assigned with corresponding
          MR-CoA. A default route MAY point to the reverse tunnel to the Home
          Agent if not overridden by prefix information.
</p>
<p>The route for the Home Address of Correspondent Router SHOULD
          also be pointing towards the optimized tunnel. However, all
          registration messages MUST be sent via the reverse tunnel to the
          Home Agent.
</p>
<p>If two prefixes overlap each other, e.g. 192.0.2.128/25 and
          192.0.2.128/29, the standard longest match rule for routing is in
          effect. However, overlapping private address SHOULD be considered an
          error situation. Any aggregation for routes in private address space
          SHOULD be conducted only at HA.

Inter-Mobile Router registration</h3>

<p>If route optimization between Mobile Router and Correspondent
          Router is desired, either Return Routability procedure must have
          been performed ( See <a class='info' href='#RRP'>Section&nbsp;3.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Return routability procedure</span><span>)</span></a>), or key KRm must be
          pre-shared between the Mobile and Correspondent Router. If a known
          KRm exists, a Mobile Router MAY send a registration request to the
          Correspondent Router's HoA.
</p>
<p>The registration request's source address and Care-of address
          field are set to the address of desired outgoing interface on the
          Mobile Router. The address MAY be same as the Care-of address used
          with Home Agent. The registration request MUST include
          Mobile-Correspondent Authentication extension defined in <a class='info' href='#AUTHENTICATIONEXT'>Section&nbsp;5.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mobile-Correspondent authentication extension</span><span>)</span></a> and Mobile Network Request
          Extension defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC5177'>[RFC5177]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Leung, K., Dommety, G., Narayanan, V., and A. Petrescu, &ldquo;Network Mobility (NEMO) Extensions for Mobile IPv4,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. The Mobile
          Network Request Extension MUST contain the network prefixes, as if
          registering in explicit mode. If timestamps are used, the
          Correspondent Router MUST check the identification field for
          validity. The registration request MUST include Home Address. The
          Authenticator field is hashed with the key KRm.
</p>
<p>The encapsulation can be set as desired, except in the case where
          the Correspondent Router's Route Optimization Cache Entry has NAT
          set or the Mobile Router itself is behind NAT or firewall. If either
          of the conditions apply, registration request MUST specify UDP
          encapsulation. It is RECOMMENDED to always use UDP encapsulation to
          facilitate detecting of path failures via keepalive mechanism.
</p>
<p>The Correspondent Router first checks the registration request's
          authentication against Kcr and nonce indexes negotiated during
          Return Routability procedure. This ensures that the registration
          request is coming from a correct Mobile Router. If the check passes,
          the Correspondent Router MUST check whether the Mobile Router
          already exists in it's Route Optimization Cache and is associated
          with the prefixes included in the request (Prefixes are present and
          Flag HA is true for each prefix).
</p>
<p>If the check against the cache fails, the Correspondent Router
          SHOULD send a re-registration request to Home Agent with the 'S'
          (solicitation) bit set, thus obtaining the latest information on
          Network Prefixes managed by incoming Mobile Router. If, even after
          this update, the prefixes still don't match, the Correspondent
          Router MUST reject the registration request. This verification is
          done to protect against Mobile Routers claiming to represent
          arbitrary networks; However, since Home Agent provides trusted
          information, it can authorize Mobile Router's claim. If the
          environment itself is considered trusted, the Correspondent Router
          can, as a policy, accept registrations from without this check;
          however, this is NOT RECOMMENDED as a general practice.
</p>
<p>If the prefixes match, the Correspondent Router MAY accept the
          registration. If the CR chooses to accept, the CR MUST check if a
          tunnel to the Mobile Router already exists. If the tunnel does NOT
          exist or has wrong endpoints (CoAs), the tunnel MUST be established
          or updated and Route Optimization Cache updated.
</p>
<p>Upon receiving the registration reply, the Mobile Router MUST
          check if a tunnel to the Correspondent Router already exists. If the
          tunnel does NOT exist, or has wrong endpoints (CoAs), a tunnel MUST
          be established and Route Optimization Cache updated. This is covered
          in <a class='info' href='#TUNNELS'>Section&nbsp;3.3.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Inter-Mobile Router tunnels</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The Correspondent Router's routing table MUST be updated to
          include the Mobile Router's networks are reachable via the direct
          tunnel to the Mobile Router.
</p>
<p>After the tunnel is established, the Mobile Router MAY update
          it's routing tables to reach all Correspondent Router's Prefixes via
          the tunnel, although it is RECOMMENDED to wait for the Correspondent
          Router to perform it's own, explicit registration. This is primarily
          a policy decision depending on the network environment. See section

Inter-Mobile Router tunnels</h3>

<p>Inter-Mobile Router tunnel establishment follows establishing
          standard reverse tunnels to the Home Agent. The registration request
          to Correspondent Router includes information on the desired
          encapsulation. It is RECOMMENDED to use UDP encapsulation. In the
          case of GRE<a class='info' href='#RFC2784'>[RFC2784]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Farinacci, D., Li, T., Hanks, S., Meyer, D., and P. Traina, &ldquo;Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE),&rdquo; March&nbsp;2000.</span><span>)</span></a>, IP over IP<a class='info' href='#RFC2003'>[RFC2003]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Perkins, C., &ldquo;IP Encapsulation within IP,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> or minimal encapsulation<a class='info' href='#RFC2004'>[RFC2004]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Perkins, C., &ldquo;Minimal Encapsulation within IP,&rdquo; October&nbsp;1996.</span><span>)</span></a> no special considerations regarding the
          reachability are necessary; The tunnel has no stateful information;
          The packets are simply encapsulated within the GRE, IP, or minimal
          header.
</p>
<p>The tunnel origination point for the Correspondent Router is its
          Care-of Address, not the Home Address where the registration
          requests were sent. This is different from creation of the Reverse
          Tunnel to Home Agent, which reuses the channel from registration
          signaling.
</p>
<p>Special considerations rise from using UDP encapsulation,
          especially in cases where one of the Mobile Routers is located
          behind NAT or firewall.A deviation from <a class='info' href='#RFC3519'>RFC
          3519<span> (</span><span class='info'>Levkowetz, H. and S. Vaarala, &ldquo;Mobile IP Traversal of Network Address Translation (NAT) Devices,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3519] is that keepalives should be sent both from ends of the
          tunnel to detect path failures. Furthermore, if either end of the
          tunnel is located behind a NAT, the first UDP keepalive SHOULD be
          successfully completed, before the tunnel is considered active.
</p>
<p>If both the Mobile Router and the Correspondent Router are behind
          separate NATs, route optimization cannot be performed between them.
          Possibilities to set up mutual tunneling when both routers are
          behind NAT, are outside the scope of this draft. However, some of
          these issues are addressed in <a class='info' href='#NATCONSIDERATIONS'>Section&nbsp;6.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>NATs and stateful firewalls </span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the route optimization procedures may occur
          concurrently at two Mobile Routers, each working as each other's
          Correspondent Router, there may be a situation where two routers are
          attempting to establish separate tunnels between them at the same
          time. If a router with a smaller Home Address (meaning a normal
          32-bit integer comparison treating IPv4 addresses as 32-bit unsigned
          integers) receives a registration request (in CR role) while its own
          registration request (sent in MR role) is still pending, the reply
          must be deferred until the tunnel initiated by its registration
          request is up. This avoids the problem of two separate tunnels
          forming concurrently between two Mobile Routers.
</p>
<p>The designations "MR" and "CR" only apply to the initial
          tunnel-establishment phase. Once a tunnel is established between two
          routers, either of them can opt to either tear down the tunnel or
          perform a handover.

Constructing route-optimized packets</h3>

          special considerations when constructing the packets, the tunnel
          interface's own processes will encapsulate any packet

Handovers and Mobile Routers leaving network</h3>

<p>Handovers and connection breakdowns can be categorized as either
          ungraceful or graceful, also known as "break-before-make" (bbm) and
          "make-before-break" (mbb) situations.
</p>
<p>As with establishment, the "Mobile Router" discussed here is the
          router wishing to change connectivity state, "Correspondent Router"
          being the peer.
</p>
<p>When a Mobile Router wishes to leave network, it SHOULD, in
          addition to sending such a request to the Home Agent, also send a
          re-registration request to all Correspondent Routers with the
          lifetime set to zero. The Correspondent Router(s), upon accepting
          this request and sending the reply, will check if it's Route
          Optimization Cache contains any prefixes associated with the
          requesting Mobile Router. These entries should be removed and
          routing table updated accordingly (traffic forwarded via the Home
          Agent again). The tunnel MUST then be destroyed. A short grace
          period MAY be used to allow possible in-transit packets to be
          received correctly.
</p>
<p>In the case of a handover, the Correspondent Router simply needs
          to update the tunnel's destination to the Mobile Router's new
          Care-of Address. Mobile Router SHOULD keep accepting packets from
          both old and new care-of Addresses for a short grace period,
          typically in the order of ten seconds.
</p>
<p>If the Mobile Router was unable to send the re-registration
          request before handover, it MUST send it immediately after handover
          is completed and binding with the Home Agent is up. If care-of
          Address has changed, the Return Routability procedure has to be
          conducted first.
</p>
<p>If a reply is not received for a registration request to a
          Correspondent Router, routes to the network prefixes managed by the
          Correspondent Router MUST be removed from the routing table, thus
          causing the user traffic to be forwarded via the Home Agent.

Convergence and synchronization issues</h3>

<p>The information the Home Agent maintains on Mobile Network prefixes
        and the Mobile Routers' Route Optimization Caches do not need to be
        explicitly synchronized. This is based on the assumption is that at
        least some of the traffic between nodes inside mobile networks is
        always bidirectional. Due to this, when a node in a mobile network
        talks to a node in another mobile network, if the initial packet does
        not trigger Route Optimization, the reply packet will.
</p>
<p>Consider a situation with three mobile networks, A, B, C handled by
        three Mobile Routers, MR A, MR B and MR C respectively. If they
        register to a Home Agent in this order, the situation goes as
        follows:
</p>
<p>MR A registers; Receives no information on other networks from HA,
        as no other MR has registered yet.
</p>
<p>MR B registers; Receives information on mobile network A being
        reachable via MR A.
</p>
<p>MR C registers; Receives information on both of the other mobile
        networks.
</p>
<p>If a node in mobile network C receives traffic from mobile network
        A, the route optimization is straightforward; MR C already has network
        A in its Route Optimization Cache. Thus, packet reception triggers
        Route Optimization towards MR A. When MR C registers to MR A (after
        Return Routability procedure is completed), MR A does not have
        information on mobile network C; Thus it will perform a
        re-registration to the Home Agent on-demand. This allows MR A to
        verify that MR C is indeed managing network C.
</p>
<p>If a node in mobile network B receives to traffic from mobile
        network C, MR B has no information on network C. No route optimization
        is triggered. However, when the node in network B replies and the
        reply reaches MR C, route optimization happens as above. Further
        examples of signaling are in <a class='info' href='#examplesignals'>Section&nbsp;8<span> (</span><span class='info'>Example signaling scenarios</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Even in the very rare case of completely unidirectional traffic
        from an entire network, the re-registrations to the Home Agent caused
        by timeouts will eventually cause convergence. However, this should be
        treated as a special case.
</p>
<p>Note that all Mobile Routers are connected to same Home Agent. For
        possibilities concerning multiple Home Agents, see <a class='info' href='#MULTIHOMEAGENTS'>Section&nbsp;6.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Multiple Home Agents</span><span>)</span></a>

Data compression schemes</h3>

<a name="rfc.section.4.1"></a><h3>4.1.&nbsp;
Prefix compression</h3>

<p>The prefix-compression is based on the idea that prefixes usually
        share common properties. The scheme is simple delta-compression. In
        the prefix information advertisement, <a class='info' href='#ROPREFIXAD'>Section&nbsp;5.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Route optimization prefix advertisement</span><span>)</span></a>, the D bit indicates whether receiving a
        "master" or a "delta" prefix. This, combined with the Prefix Length
        information, allows for compression and decompression of prefix
        information.
</p>
<p>If D=0, what follows in the "Prefix" field are bits 1..n of the a
        new master prefix, where n is PLen. This is rounded up to nearest full
        octet. Thus, prefix lengths of /4 and /8 take 1 octet, /12 and /16
        take 2 octets, /20 and /24 three, and larger than that full 4
        octets.
</p>
<p>If D=1, what follows in the "Prefix" field are bits m..PLen of the
        prefix, where m is the first changed bit of previous master prefix,
        with padding from master prefix filling the field to full octet.
        Maximum value of Plen-m is 8 (that is, delta MUST fit into one octet).
        If this is not possible, a new master prefix has to be declared.
</p>
<p>Determining the order of prefix transmission should be based on
        saving maximum space during transmission.
</p>
<p>Example of compression and transmitted data, where network prefixes
        192.0.2.0/28, 192.0.2.64/26 and 192.0.2.128/25 are transmitted are

<p>First prefix, 192.0.2.0/28, is considered a master prefix and is
        transmitted in full. The PLen of 28 bits determines that all four
        octets must be transmitted. If the prefix would have been e.g.
        192.0.2.0/24, three octets would have sufficed since 24 bits fit into
        3 octets.
</p>
<p>For the following prefixes, the D=1. Thus, they are deltas of the
        previous prefix where D was zero.
</p>
<p>192.0.2.64/26 includes bits 19-26 (full octet). Bits 19-25 are
        copied from master prefix, but bit 26 is changed to 1. The final
        notation in binary is "1001", or 0x09.
</p>
<p>192.0.2.128/25 includes bits 18-25 (full octet). Bits 18-24 are
        copied from master prefix, but bit 25 is changed to 1. The final
        notation in binary is "101", or 0x05.
</p>
<p>The final encoding thus becomes:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
+----------------+--------+-+---------------------+
|     Prefix     |  Plen  |D| Transmitted Prefix  |

| 192.0.2.0/28   |  28    |0| 0xc0 0x00 0x02 0x00 |
| 192.0.2.64/26  |  26    |1| 0x09                |
| 192.0.2.128/25 |  25    |1| 0x05                |
+----------------+--------+-+---------------------+
</pre></div>
<p>It should be noted that in this case the order of prefix
        transmission would not affect compression efficiency. If prefix
        192.0.2.128/25 would have been considered the master prefix and the
        others as deltas instead, the resulting encoding still fits into one
        octet for the subsequent prefixes. There would be no need to declare a
        new master prefix.

<a name="rfc.section.4.2.1"></a><h3>4.2.1.&nbsp;
Encoding of compressed realms</h3>

<p>In order to reduce the size of messages, the system introduces a
          realm compression scheme, which reduces the size of realms in a
          message. The compression scheme is a simple dynamically updated
          dictionary based algorithm, which is designed to compress arbitrary
          length text strings. In this scheme, an entire realm, a single label
          or a list of labels may be replaced with an index to a previous
          occurrence of the same string stored in the dictionary. The realm
          compression defined in this specification was inspired by the <a class='info' href='#RFC1035'>RFC 1035<span> (</span><span class='info'>Mockapetris, P., &ldquo;Domain names - implementation and specification,&rdquo; November&nbsp;1987.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC1035] DNS domain name label compression.
          Our algorithm is, however, improved to gain more compression.
</p>
<p>When compressing realms, the dictionary is first reset and does
          not contain a single string. The realms are processed one by one so
          the algorithm does not expect to see them all or the whole message
          at once. The state of the compressor is the current content of the
          dictionary. The realms are compressed label by label or as a list of
          labels. The dictionary can hold maximum 128 strings. Thus, when
          adding the 129th string into the dictionary, the dictionary MUST
          first be reset to the initial state (i.e. Emptied) and the index of
          the string will become 0.
</p>
<p>The encoding of an index to the dictionary or an uncompressed run
          of octets representing a single label has purposely been made simple
          and the whole encoding works on an octet granularity. The encoding
          of an uncompressed label takes the form of a one octet:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
 0
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-=================-+-+-+-+
|0|   LENGTH    | 'length' octets long string.. |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-=================-+-+-+-+
</pre></div>
<p>This encoding allows label lengths from 1 to 127 octets. A label
          length of zero (0) is not allowed. The "label length" tag octet is
          then followed by up to 127 octets of the actual encoded label
          string.
</p>
<p>The index to the dictionary (the "label index" tag octet) takes
          the form of a one octet:
</p><div style='display: table; width: 0; margin-left: 3em; margin-right: auto'><pre>
 0
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|1|   INDEX     |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
</pre></div>
<p>The above encodings do not allow generating an output octet value
          of zero (0). The encapsulating Mobile IPv4 extension makes use of
          this property and uses the value of zero (0) to mark the end of
          compressed realm or to indicate an empty realm. It is also possible
          to encode the complete realm using only "label length" tags. In this
          case no compression takes place. This allows the sender to skip
          compression, for example to reduce computation requirements when
          generating messages. However, the receiver MUST always be prepared
          to receive compressed realms.

<a name="rfc.section.4.2.2"></a><h3>4.2.2.&nbsp;
Searching algorithm</h3>

<p>When compressing the input realm, the dictionary is searched for
          a matching string. If no match could be found, the last label is
          removed from the right-hand side of the used input realm. The search
          is repeated until the whole input realm has been processed. If no
          match was found at all, then the first label of the original input
          realm is encoded using the "label length" tag and the label is
          inserted into the dictionary. The previously described search is
          repeated with the remaining part of the input realm, if any. If
          nothing remains, the realm encoding is complete.
</p>
<p>When a matching string is found in the dictionary the matching
          part of the input realm is encoded using the "label index" tag. The
          matching part of the input realm is removed and the search is
          repeated with the remaining part of the input realm, if any. If
          nothing remains, the octet value of zero (0) is inserted to mark the
          end of encoded realm.
</p>
<p>The search algorithm also maintains the "longest non-matching
          string" for each input realm. Each time the search in dictionary
          fails and a new label gets encoded using the "label length" tag and
          inserted into the dictionary, the "longest non-matching string" is
          concatenated by this label including the separating "." (dot, i.e.
          Hexadecimal 0x2e). When a match is found in the dictionary the
          "longest non-matching string" is reset (i.e. Emptied). Once the
          whole input realm has been processed and encoded, all possible
          suffixes longer than one label are taken from the string and
          inserted into the dictionary.

Encoding example</h3>

<p>This section shows an example how to encode a set of realms using
          the specified realm compression algorithm. For example, a message
          might need to compress the realms "foo.example.com",
          "bar.foo.example.com", "buz.foo.example.org", "example.com" and
          "bar.example.com.org". The following example shows the processing of
          input realms on the left side and the contents of the dictionary on
          the right hand side. The example uses hexadecimal representation of
          numbers.

</pre></div>
<p>As can be seen from the example, due the greedy approach of
          encoding matches, the search algorithm and the dictionary update
          function is not the most optimal one. However, we do not claim the
          algorithm would be the most efficient. It functions efficiently
          enough for most inputs. In this example, the original input realm
          data was 79 octets and the compressed output excluding the end mark
          is 35 octets.

NATs and stateful firewalls </h3>

<p>Mechanisms described in <a class='info' href='#RFC3519'>MIP NAT
        traversal<span> (</span><span class='info'>Levkowetz, H. and S. Vaarala, &ldquo;Mobile IP Traversal of Network Address Translation (NAT) Devices,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2003.</span><span>)</span></a> [RFC3519] allow the Home Agent to work with Mobile Nodes
        situated behind a NAT device or a stateful firewall. Furthermore, the
        Home Agent may also detect whether NAT device is located between the
        Mobile Node and the HA. This information is passed on to the other
        Mobile Routers with the 'O' flag in <a class='info' href='#ROPREFIXAD'>Route
        optimization prefix advertisement extension<span> (</span><span class='info'>Route optimization prefix advertisement</span><span>)</span></a>, and to the
        registering Mobile Router with the 'N' flag in <a class='info' href='#ROR'>Route Optimization Reply extension<span> (</span><span class='info'>Route optimization reply</span><span>)</span></a>. In the case of
        one or both of the routers behind NAT or similarly impaired (not being
        able to accept incoming connections), the tunnel establishment
        procedure takes this into account. The existence of NAT or firewall
        implies that UDP encapsulation MUST be used.
</p>
<p>In the case where Mobile Router is behind NAT (or firewall) and
        Correspondent Router is not, the Mobile Router will, when tunnel has
        been established, send keepalive messages (ICMP echo requests) through
        the tunnel. Until a reply has been received, the tunnel SHOULD NOT be
        considered active. Once reply has been received, NAT mapping is in
        place and traffic can be sent.
</p>
<p>If Mobile Router and Correspondent Router are behind same NAT from
        HA's point of view, it is possible to establish tunnel between them.
        This may also be the situation in the case of nested NATs. It may be
        possible in specific cases that if two Mobile Routers' registration
        messages appear to come from same translated address, for Home Agent
        to strip the 'O' flag in the prefix advertisement messages. However,
        this does not work in case of nested NATs. Some sort of "Route
        optimization discovery" protocol (see <a class='info' href='#EXTENSIBILITY'>Section&nbsp;6.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Extensibility</span><span>)</span></a>), or more information in the Route
        Optimization capability advertisements is required for more
        generalized solution.
</p>
<p>If both the Mobile Router and the Correspondent Router are behind
        two separate NATs, some sort of proxy or hole-punching technique may
        be needed. This is out of scope of this draft.

Multiple Home Agents</h3>

<p>Mobile Routers can negotiate and perform route optimization without
        the assistance of Home Agent - if they can discover each others
        existence and thus know where to send registration messages. This
        draft only addresses a logically single Home Agent that distributes
        network prefix information to the Mobile Routers. Problems arise from
        possible trust relationships; In this draft the Home Agent serves as a
        way to provide verification that a specific network is managed by a
        specific router.
</p>
<p>If Route Optimization is desired between nodes attached to separate
        Home Agents, there are several possibilities. Note that standard high
        availability redundancy protocols, such as VRRP, can be utilized;
        However, in such case the Home Agent is still a single logical entity
        even if consisting of more than a single node.
</p>
<p>Several possibilities exist for achieving Route Optimization
        between Mobile Routers attached to separate Home Agents, such as a new
        discovery/probing protocol, routing protocol between Home Agents or
        DNS SRV records, or a common AAA architecture. There already is a
        framework for HA to retrieve information from AAA so it can be
        considered as the most viable possibility. See <a class='info' href='#EXTENSIBILITY'>Section&nbsp;6.5<span> (</span><span class='info'>Extensibility</span><span>)</span></a> for information on possibility to
        generalize the method.
</p>
<p>Any discovery/probing protocols are out of scope for this
        draft.

Mutualness of Route Optimization</h3>

<p>The procedure as specified is asymmetric; That is, if bidirectional
        route optimization is desired while maintaining consistency, the route
        optimization (RR check and registration) has to be performed in both
        directions, but this is not strictly necessary. This is primarily a
        policy decision depending on how often the mobile prefixes are
        reconfigured.
</p>
<p>Consider the case where two networks, A and B, are handled by
        Mobile Routers A and B respectively. If the routers are set up in such
        a fashion that Route Optimization is triggered when a packet is
        received from a Network Prefix in Route Optimization Cache, the
        following occurs if a node in network A starts sending ICMP echo
        requests (pinging) a node in network B.
</p>
<p>MR B sees the incoming ICMP echo request packet, which is
        travelling inside the reverse tunnel to the Home Agent. MR B sees that
        the destination is in network B, and furthermore, source is in network
        A which exists in the cache. This triggers Route Optimization
        processing. Until RO is active, the ping packets (echo requests and
        replies) are routed via the reverse tunnel.
</p>
<p>MR B completes RR procedure and registration with MR A, which thus
        becomes a Correspondent Router for MR B. A tunnel is created between
        the routers. MR A updates its routing tables so that network B is
        reachable via MR A &lt;-&gt; MR B tunnel.
</p>
<p>The traffic pattern is now that packets from network B to network A
        are sent over the direct tunnel, but the packets from A to B are
        transmitted via the Home Agent and reverse tunnels. MR A now performs
        its own registration towards MR B. Upon completion, MR A notices that
        a tunnel to MR B already exists, but updates its routing table so that
        network B is now reachable via the MR A &lt;-&gt; MR B tunnel. From
        this point onward, traffic is bidirectional.
</p>
<p>In this scenario, if MR A does NOT perform a separate route
        optimization (RR check and registration), but instead simply updates
        its routing table to reach network B via the tunnel, problems may
        arise if MR B has started to manage another network B' before the
        information has propagated to MR A. The end result is that MR B starts
        to receive packets for network B' via the Home Agent and for network B
        via direct tunnel. If Reverse Path checking or similar mechanism is in
        use on MR B, packets from network A could be black holed.
</p>
<p>Whether to perform this mutual registration or not thus depends on
        the situation, and whether Mobile Routers are going to start managing
        additional Network Prefixes during operation.

Extensibility</h3>

<p>The design considerations include several mechanisms which might
        not be strictly necessary if Route Optimization would only be desired
        between individual customer sites in a managed network. The
        registration procedure (with the optional Return Routability part),
        which allows for Correspondent Routers to learn Mobile Router's
        Care-of Addresses is not strictly necessary; The CoA's could have been
        provided by HA directly.
</p>
<p>However, this approach allows the method to be extended to a more
        generic route optimization. The primary driver for having Home Agent
        to work as a centralized information distributer is to provide Mobile
        Routers with the knowledge of not only the other routers, but to
        provide information on which networks are managed by which
        routers.
</p>
<p>The Home Agent provides the information on all feasible nodes with
        which it is possible to establish Route Optimization. If representing
        a whole Mobile Network is not necessary, in effect the typical Mobile
        Node &lt;-&gt; Correspondent Node situation, the mechanisms in this
        draft work just as well - only problem is discovering if the target
        Correspondent Node can provide Route Optimization capability. This can
        be performed by not including any prefixes in the information
        extension, just the HoA address of Mobile Router.
</p>
<p>In addition, with Route Optimization for single node, checks on
        whether a Mobile Router is allowed to represent specific networks are
        unnecessary since there are none.
</p>
<p>Correspondent node/router discovery protocols (whether they are
        based on probing or a centralized directory beyond the single Home
        Agent) are outside the scope of this draft.

Load Balancing</h3>

<p>The design simply provides possibility to create optimal paths
        between Mobile Routers; It doesn't dictate what should be the user
        traffic using these paths. One possible approach in helping facilitate
        load balancing and utilizing all available paths is presented in <a class='info' href='#I-D.gundavelli-mip4-multiple-tunnel-support'>[I&#8209;D.gundavelli&#8209;mip4&#8209;multiple&#8209;tunnel&#8209;support]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Gundavelli, S. and K. Leung, &ldquo;Multiple Tunnel Support for Mobile IPv4,&rdquo; February&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>, which
        effectively allows for multiple Care-of addresses for a single Home
        Address.

<a name="rfc.section.7"></a><h3>7.&nbsp;
Scalability</h3>

<p>Home Agent assisted Route Optimization scalability issues stem from
      the general Mobile IPv4 architecture which is based on tunnels.
      Creating, maintaining and destroying tunnel interfaces can cause load on
      the Mobile Routers. However, the MRs can always fall back to normal,
      reverse tunnelled routing if resource constraints are apparent.
</p>
<p>If there is a large number of optimization-capable prefixes,
      maintaining state for all of these may be an issue also, due to limits
      on routing table sizes.
</p>
<p>Registration responses from Home Agent to Mobile Router may provide
      information on large number of network prefixes. If thousands of
      networks are involved, the registration reply messages are bound to grow
      very large. The prefix- and realm compression mechanisms defined in
      <a class='info' href='#compressionsformats'>Section&nbsp;4<span> (</span><span class='info'>Data compression schemes</span><span>)</span></a> mitigates this problem to an
      extent. There will, however, be some practical upper limit after which
      point some other delivery mechanism for the prefix information will be
      needed.

IANA Considerations</h3>

<p>IANA has assigned rules for the existing registry "Mobile IPv4

      appear in Mobile IP control messages (those sent to and from UDP port
      number 434) should be modified.

<p>New Mobile IP header extension and message type values are needed for
      the messages and extensions listed in <a class='info' href='#MESSAGESANDEXTENSIONS'>Section&nbsp;5<span> (</span><span class='info'>New Mobile IPv4 messages and extensions</span><span>)</span></a>. There is a skippable extension
      which requires it's own type number. The rest of the new extensions are
      non-skippable, and grouped under a single new type as subtypes, apart
      from authentication extension which is given it's own type number to
      appear similar with other authentication extensions.

<a name="rfc.section.10.1"></a><h3>10.1.&nbsp;
Trust relationships</h3>

<p>The network of trust relationships in Home Agent assisted Route
        Optimization solve the issues where arbitrary Correspondent Router can
        trust an arbitrary Mobile Router that it is indeed the proper route to
        reach an arbitrary mobile network.
</p>
<p>It is assumed that all Mobile Routers have a trust relationship
        with the Home Agent. Thus, they trust information provided by Home
        Agent.
</p>
<p>The Home Agent provides information matching Home Addresses and
        network prefixes. Each Mobile Router trusts this information.
</p>
<p>Mobile Routers may perform Return Routability procedure between
        each other. This creates a trusted association between Mobile Router
        Home Address and Care-of Address. The Mobile Router also claims to
        represent a specific network. This information is not trustworthy as
        such.
</p>
<p>The claim can be verified by checking the Home Address &lt;-&gt;
        network prefix information received, either earlier, or due to
        on-demand request, from the Home Agent. If they match, the Mobile
        Router's claim is authentic. If the network is considered trusted, a
        policy decision can be made to skip this check. Exact definitions on
        situations where such decision can be made are out of scope of this
        draft. The RECOMMENDED general practice is to perform the check.
