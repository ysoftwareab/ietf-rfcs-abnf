Abstract

   The Netnews Administration System (NAS) is a framework to simplify
   the administration and usage of network news (also known as Netnews)
   on the Internet.  Data for the administration of newsgroups and
   hierarchies are kept in a distributed hierarchical database and are
   available through a client-server protocol.

   The database is accessible by news servers, news administrators, and
   news readers.  News servers can update their configuration
   automatically; administrators are able to get the data manually.
   News reader programs are able to get certain information from an NAS
   server, automatically or at a user&#x27;s discretion, which provides
   detailed information about groups and hierarchies to the user.

   NAS is usable in coexistence with the current, established process of
   control messages; an unwanted interference is impossible.
   Furthermore, NAS is able to reflect the somewhat chaotic structure of
   Usenet in a hierarchical database.  NAS can be used without
   modification of existing news relay, news server, or news reader
   software; however, some tasks will be better accomplished with NAS-
   compliant software.

1.  Introduction

   An increasing number of newsgroups, hierarchies, and articles has
   made the administration of news servers a complex and time-consuming
   task.  The tools for the administration have remained unchanged for
   ten years and are no longer appropriate.  Many hierarchies are
   inconsistent; many new newsgroups are not created or only with a
   large delay; removed groups keep lurking in the configuration files
   for a long period of time.  There is no administration tool that
   utilizes the power of the Internet, and it is not possible to check
   the consistency of the news server at a given point of time.

   Users find it difficult to get an overview of the newsgroups, the
   charter of a particular one, which language is preferred, or whether
   a group is moderated.  Renaming, the status change from moderated to
   unmoderated or vice versa, and the splitting of a group into several
   others are dynamic processes.  These processes are in common use, but
   it takes a long time until every news server is aware of these
   changes.

   An increasing number of faked control messages has appeared in the
   last few years.  Purposely or accidentally, control messages were
   sent to foreign news servers to create or remove a certain group,
   although this was not approved according to the rules of the
   hierarchy in question.  Due to this fact, automatic creation and
   removal are disabled on many news servers, and several dead groups
   have not been deleted.  It is very difficult for users to determine
   the current status of a group, and in some cases they simply cannot
   tell that the group they are posting to is not an active group but a
   dead or invalid one.

   It is the design goal of Netnews Administration System (NAS) to
   provide an out-of-band system that helps to maintain, propagate, and
   deliver the required information.  There will not be any interference
   with current protocols and standards.  It is not intended to make use
   of control messages or some special Network News Transfer Protocol
   (NNTP) commands.  The advantage of NAS is that it provides more
   information in a more structured format than that of control
   messages.  Not only news server administrators but also Usenet users
   can get more detailed information about newsgroups and hierarchies.

   Due to the fact that a client connects to a server and the server
   asks for authentication, this is a more reasonable procedure for
   transmitting information than that for control messages.

   Furthermore, it is possible to check for changes on a regular basis
   at customized intervals to keep local data up-to-date.

2.  Overview

   NAS is based on a database that contains information about certain
   groups and hierarchies.  This database is structured in a
   hierarchical manner and distributed to various servers, and it is
   able to receive queries at any time.  The service is comparable to
   directory services like DNS, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP), or Network Information Service (NIS).  The NAS protocol is
   inspired by protocols like NNTP and SMTP.  The port 991 is reserved
   for NAS and registered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
   (IANA) [IANA-PN].

   The organizational structure of NAS is hierarchical; this means that
   a NAS root server collects data from the sub-servers that are
   authoritative for certain hierarchies.  The root server signs the
   data and distributes it authoritatively.  Replication of database
   entries is possible.  The hierarchical structure can consist of
   multiple levels.  Usage of the database is possible for news servers,
   news readers, and special client programs.  The communication is
   based on TCP and UDP.

   Taking the real world into account, there might be some policy
   problems with a single root server.  But it is possible to establish
   a structure like that of the current Usenet system, where some
   hierarchies have a good administration with a well-defined system of
   rules, and where some are not well maintained.  The goal is to get as
   much information as possible under one hat, but there can be no
   &quot;official&quot; force to achieve this.

   During the startup phase, it is quite likely that there will be a
   root server, handling just hierarchies with strict rules and accepted
   authorities (e.g., BIG8, de.*, us.*, bln.*, fr.*, it.*).

   However, it is also imaginable to have some NAS servers providing
   data on, for example, alt.!binaries, some providing data on alt.*,
   and even some providing alt.*  following special policies or sets of
   rules.

   An administrator using NAS will have the choice to use just one root
   server (and all its data) or to use another NAS server for special
   hierarchies.

   NAS contains information about newsgroups and complete hierarchies.
   Furthermore, it contains information about the hierarchies&#x27;
   inheritable entries and default values for a single newsgroup.

3.  Protocol Level

   It is expected that the real-life use of NAS will change the
   requirements for the Netnews Administration System.  On the one hand,
   the protocol has to be extensible and flexible in order to implement
   improvements; on the other hand, it must ensure compatibility between
   different versions.  A simultaneous migration of all sites using NAS
   to a new protocol version is not likely to happen.  To solve this
   problem, NAS has a protocol level.  This protocol level describes the
   current functionality.  The protocol level, being a number between 1
   and 32767, is negotiated at connection setup.  Enhancements and
   modifications must use a different protocol level than that of their
   predecessors.  (Usually the protocol level is incremented by 1 with
   every new version of the protocol specification.) Every current or
   future implementation MUST be compatible with protocol level 1 in
   order to fall back to this level if communication on a higher level
   fails.

   An implementation of higher protocol levels should be able to emulate
   the behavior of lower levels, even if this implies a loss of
   features.  The negotiation of the protocol level between client and
   server is described in the specification of the command VERS.  If
   there is no agreement on the protocol level, only commands of the

   protocol level 1 MUST be used.  Documents enhancing or modifying the
   NAS standard MUST specify on which level these changes take place and
   how the behavior should be in other protocol levels.

   This document describes protocol level 1.

4.  Description of Functions

   In order to use an NAS server, a connection must be opened by the
   client.  The NAS server can be located in the same domain or
   somewhere else on the Internet.

   The NAS system is hierarchical.  The idea is to have an NAS root
   server like the DNS root servers.  The root server distributes the
   data collected from client NAS servers that are authoritative servers
   for their hierarchy.  The maintenance of the authoritative data is
   possible on any system.  The root server collects the data and makes
   them available to other servers, which can in turn distribute these
   data to other servers.  The administrator has the opportunity to make
   use of either all data or only parts of the database.  NAS servers
   can ask multiple NAS servers for data.  An attached time stamp makes
   it possible to distinguish between new and old data and to avoid
   loops in the propagation.

   To describe the NAS in greater detail, it is necessary to emphasize
   the hierarchical design of the NAS system.  The following figure
   shows the propagation of data along the server hierarchy.

   Authoritative data for a newsgroup or a hierarchy are collected and
   written into a database.  These data are available through a local
   NAS server and are collected from this authoritative server by
   upstream NAS servers.

   There may also be NAS servers that are not authoritative servers;
   these servers merely provide the information they collect from other
   NAS servers to clients such as news servers, administration programs,
   and news readers.

   Requests to an NAS server originating at a client (as well as at
   another server) are accomplished in several steps: establishing a
   connection, authentication (optional), negotiating a protocol level
   (optional), queries on the database, and termination.

   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

6.  Specification of the NAS Protocol (TCP)

6.1.  Responses

6.1.1.  Overview

   An answer starts with a response code (a three-digit number),
   optionally followed by white space and a textual message.  Then the
   actual text/data follows.  Text is sent as a series of successive
   lines of textual matter, each terminated with CRLF.  A single line
   containing only a single period (&#x27;.&#x27;) is sent to indicate the end of
   the text (i.e., the server will send a CRLF at the end of the last
   line of text, a period, and another CRLF).

   <span class="Verified-inline-styling" id='inline-5813'>   answer = response-code [answertext] CRLF <button id="btn_5813" target="expand_5813" onclick='hideFunction("expand_5813")'>Expand</button>
            *(text CRLF)
            &quot;.&quot; CRLF</span id__locate=5813>
<div class="nodeCloseClass" id='expand_5813'><div class='Verified-endnote-styling' id='eid5813'>
<pre>
<b><i><a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid5813'>EID 5813</a> (Verified) is as follows:</i></b>

<b>Section:</b> 6.1.1

<b>Original Text:</b>

   Answer = response-code [answertext] CRLF
            text CRLF
            &quot;.&quot; CRLF

<b>Corrected Text:</b>

   answer = response-code [answertext] CRLF
            *(text CRLF)
            &quot;.&quot; CRLF
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br/>
There may be zero, one or more additional lines of text followed by a CRLF.
</div>
</div>
   If the original text contains a period as the first character of the
   text line, that first period is doubled.  Therefore, the client must
   examine the first character of each line received and, for those
   beginning with a period, determine either that this is the end of the
   text or that it should collapse the doubled period to a single one.

   Example

   &lt;-- INFO
   --&gt; 101 Information follows
       Server: nas.example.org (192.0.2.100)
       Uptime: 2 weeks, 3 days, 5 hours, 9 minutes
       Software: NAS 1.0
       Client: client.example.org (192.0.2.123)
       Connection: 9 minutes
       Highest protocol level supported: 1
       Requested protocol level: 1
       Protocol level used: 1
       .

6.1.2.  Response Code Values, Structure, and Meaning

   The first digit of the response code indicates the message type
   (i.e., information, success, warning, error, or data):

   1xx Information
   2xx Request successful
   3xx Request successful, data follow
   4xx Request accepted, but no operation possible

   5xx Request is wrong (syntax error), is not implemented, or leads to
       an internal error
   6xx Request successful, data follow until end mark

   The second digit specifies the message category:

   x0x Connection-related stuff
   x1x Queries, answers, or data
   x2x Server-server communication
   x3x Authentication, authorization
   x8x Non-standard extensions
   x9x Debugging output

   The actual response code for a specific command is listed in the
   description of the commands.  Answers of the type 1xx, 2xx, 4xx, and
   5xx can have a text after the numerical code.  3xx answers contain
   one or more parameters with data; the exact format is explained in
   the description of the commands.

   An answer to an incorrect request may be longer than one line.

6.2.  Connection Setup

   NAS typically uses port 991, which is reserved by IANA [IANA-PN].  If
   a connection is set up by the client, the server answers immediately
   (without a request) with the greeting message, which will start with
   code 200:

   --&gt; 200 Welcome!
       nas.example.org ready
       .

   If a connection is refused because the client has no permission to
   access the server, the answer code is 434.  That decision can be made
   on connection startup based on the client&#x27;s IP address.  When the
   server is currently out of service, the answer code is 404.

    Examples:

   --&gt; 434 You have no permission to retrieve data.  Good bye.
       .

   --&gt; 404 Maintenance time
       .

   After sending a 404 or 434 message, the connection will be closed.

6.3.  Commands

6.3.1.  Structure

   A command consists of a command word, sometimes followed by a
   parameter.  Parameters are separated from the command word by white
   space.

   Commands used in the NAS protocol are not case sensitive.  A command
   word or parameter may be uppercase, lowercase, or any mixture of
   upper- and lowercase.

   The length of a command line is not limited.  If the need to limit
   the length of command lines in real-life implementations arises,
   answer code 513 (line too long) should be returned.

   The protocol level described in this document uses command words with
   a length of exactly four characters each.

   In examples, octets sent to the NAS server are preceded by &quot;&lt;-- &quot; and
   those sent by the NAS server by &quot;--&gt; &quot;.  The indicator is omitted if
   the direction of the dialog does not change.

6.3.2.  Overview

   The commands described below are defined using the Augmented Backus-
   Naur Form (ABNF) defined in [RFC4234].  The definitions for &#x27;ALPHA&#x27;,
   &#x27;CRLF&#x27;, &#x27;DIGIT&#x27;, &#x27;WSP&#x27; and &#x27;VCHAR&#x27; are taken from appendix B of
   [RFC4234] and not repeated here.

   The following ABNF definitions constitute the set of NAS commands
   that can be sent from the client to an NAS server.

6.3.3.  Detailed Description

   Some overall definitions follow:

   response-code = 3DIGIT   ; three digit number

   Newsgroup names and hierarchy names are defined according to the
   following ABNF definitions.  Since a hierarchy name can be the same
   as a newsgroup name (e.g., hierarchy bln.announce.fub.* and newsgroup
   name bln.announce.fub), there is no difference between the two.

   name                  =  plain-component *(&quot;.&quot; component)
   component             =  plain-component / encoded-word
   encoded-word          =  1*( lowercase / DIGIT /
                                &quot;+&quot; / &quot;-&quot; / &quot;/&quot; / &quot;_&quot; / &quot;=&quot; / &quot;?&quot; )
   plain-component       =  component-start *component-rest
   component-start       =  lowercase / DIGIT
   lowercase             =  %x61-7A ; letter a-z lowercase
   component-rest        =  component-start / &quot;+&quot; / &quot;-&quot; / &quot;_&quot;

   NOTE: This definition of newsgroup name is in reference to &quot;News
   Article Format and Transmission&quot; [SON1036].  When the document &quot;News
   Article Format&quot; [USEFOR] is established as an RFC, its definitions
   should be integrated into a higher protocol level of NAS.

   Description

   Prints the current time of the server in UTC (Universal Coordinated

   The DATE command is only for informational use and to check the
   server time.  For regular transmission of time over the network, the
   Network Time Protocol (NTP) [RFC1305] should be used.

6.3.3.4.  VERS

   Description

   The VERS command is used to determine the protocol level to use
   between client and server.  The parameter is a protocol level that
   the client supports and wants to use.  The server will respond with
   the highest level accepted.  This version number MUST not be higher
   than that requested by the client.  Client and server MUST only use
   commands from the level that the server has confirmed.  It is
   possible, but seldom necessary, to change the protocol level during a
   session by client request (VERS [protocol level]).  When no option is
   given, the current protocol level will be printed.  When no protocol
   level is negotiated, the protocol level 1 will be used.  Commands of
   a higher level are not allowed without successful negotiation.  The
   protocol level can be followed by an optional comment.

   vers-cmd =  &quot;VERS&quot; [WSP level] CRLF

   level = 1*5DIGIT ; the valid range is 1 - 32767

   Description

   To obtain a recursive list of newsgroups and sub-hierarchies in the

   hierarchies is also given.  The highest level consists of all top-
   level hierarchies and is labeled &quot;*&quot;.  It can be obtained this way,
   too.

   The use of &quot;*&quot; as a wildcard pattern following the beginning of a
   hierarchy name is also possible; so a &quot;LSTR de.a*&quot; would return a
   list of all newsgroups and hierarchies starting with &quot;de.a&quot;.

6.3.3.8.  HIER

   Description

   The command HIER lists all information available about the hierarchy.
   With the data header &quot;Name&quot;, a new data block for each hierarchy is
   started.  The header &quot;Name&quot; gives the name of the hierarchy.  The
   data headers are described in Section 6.3.4.  The default is to
   transmit all available information.  It can be limited to a list of
   desired headers (&quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Status&quot; are always given).  A set of
   comma-separated headers, as an option to the HIER command, will
   return the requested header fields.

   hier-cmd  = &quot;HIER&quot; 1*(WSP name) [WSP selection] CRLF

   selection = *( &quot;,&quot; header )        ; Describes the data fields
                                      ; that are requested
   header    = ALPHA *( ALPHA / &quot;-&quot; ) ; According to section 6.3.4

   Example for selection

6.3.3.10.  GETP

   Description

   GETP is used for server-server communication.  It requests the data
   for the hierarchy specified by the parameter &quot;name&quot;.  The format of
   the data is the same as for the commands &quot;HIER&quot; and &quot;LIST&quot;.  If &quot;*&quot;
   is given as hierarchy name, all data the server is offering will be
   transmitted.

   The &quot;timestamp&quot; attached to a package consists of the date and time
   that the package was created.  The timestamp for a package is
   transmitted together with the package data by the server and marks a
   specific revision for the package data.

   When a client requests a package with GETP, it transmits the
   timestamp attached to the package in its database so that the server
   can check whether the data on the client side is still valid or if it
   is too old.  If the data on the client side is still valid, a 213
   answer is sent, so the client knows that its data is OK.  If the
   timestamp is &quot;0&quot;, the server is forced to transmit the data.

   Timestamps set by the server must be increasing and may not be more
   than 12 hours in the future.

   The data for a successful request are signed and sent in ASCII armor
   according to [RFC2440], so a client can check the signature or ignore
   it.  The actual data will be surrounded by the armor start and end
   sections, according to Section 6.2 of [RFC2440].

   getp-cmd =  &quot;GETP&quot; WSP username WSP password WSP timestamp
               WSP ( name / &quot;*&quot; ) CRLF

   username =  *1( VCHAR ) / &quot;0&quot; ; Length of VCHAR &gt;= 1

   password =  *1( VCHAR ) / &quot;0&quot; ; Length of VCHAR &gt;= 1

   timestamp   =  utc-time / ; date and time of the last retrieval
                  &quot;0&quot;        ; force the transmission of data

   Possible answers

   213: Current data at the client side
   411: No hierarchy with that name
   430: Permission denied
   510: Syntax error
   613: Hierarchy data

6.3.3.11.  GETA

   Description

   The GETA command is used for server-server communication; it is used
   to collect authoritative data and will request packages that the
   server is authoritative for.  A package is the authoritative data
   either for a newsgroup or a hierarchy.  Each package has a
   &quot;timestamp&quot; attached to mark the revision of the package.  This
   timestamp is set by the server to the date of the last modification
   of the package data in UTC format.  A timestamp of &quot;0&quot; indicates that
   the package MUST be retrieved.  If the retrieving client has a recent
   package (i.e., no modification on the authoritative server), the
   server sends only a 215 response.  The format of the data is the same
   as that for the commands &quot;HIER&quot; and &quot;LIST&quot;.

6.3.3.12.  Unknown Commands and Syntax Errors

   If a command is recognized as unknown, a 519 return code (unknown
   command) is given.  If an error occurs after the command string
   (e.g., a missing parameter), a 510 return code (Syntax error: Missing
   parameter) is given.

6.3.4.  Data Headers

   The following paragraphs describe key words and key terms that
   support retrieval and storing of information.  Every header has a
   unique English name.

   The content of a header is inheritable within a hierarchy, as long as

   the header is marked as inheritable.  The content is the default
   value for all downstream newsgroups and sub-hierarchies.  For
   example, in the hierarchy &quot;de&quot;, the language header has the value
   &quot;DE&quot; (German); therefore, this value is &quot;DE&quot; for all newsgroups in
   this hierarchy, except for those that explicitly define a language
   code of their own.

   Hierarchies and newsgroups must have at least values for the headers

   The status indicator uniquely determines the status of a hierarchy or
   newsgroup.  The indicator is case insensitive.

   Indicator    Type       Description
   -----------  ---------  -------------------------------------------
   Complete     hierarchy  Authorized, complete known hierarchy
   Incomplete   hierarchy  Not completely known hierarchy (like free.*)
   Obsolete     hierarchy  Obsolete  hierarchy; should  contain only
                           newsgroups with status &quot;Removed&quot;
   Unknown      hierarchy  No information available; unknown hierarchy
   Unmoderated  newsgroup  Posting allowed; unmoderated
   Readonly     newsgroup  Posting not allowed
   Moderated    newsgroup  Moderated group; articles must be sent to
                           the moderator
   Removed      newsgroup  Deleted or renamed newsgroup; no posting or
                           transport
   Unknown      newsgroup  Unknown group; no information available
   -----------  ---------  -------------------------------------------

6.5.  Newsgroup Types

   A Newsgroup Type is a comprehensive overview about some
   characteristics of a newsgroup, being a test group, a binary group,
   or some other kind.  The Newsgroup Type is case insensitive.

   Type          Meaning
   -----------   ------------------------------------------------------
   Discussion    Discussion (text postings)
   Binary        (Encoded) binary postings
   Sources       Source postings (e.g., comp.unix.sources)
   Announce      Announcements, press releases, RfD/CfV
   Test          Test postings, sometimes reflectors (e.g., de.test)

   Robots        Automatic postings (like the former comp.mail.maps)
   Experiment    Experimental, other
   -----------   ------------------------------------------------------

6.6.  Hierarchy Types

   To describe a hierarchy, the following Hierarchy Types are used.
   These Types are used to mark some properties of a news hierarchy.
   They are case insensitive.

   Type             Meaning
   --------------   ---------------------------------------------------
   Global           International, global hierarchy
                    (e.g., the hierarchies comp, de, rec)
   Regional         Regional hierarchy
                    (e.g., the hierarchies ba, bln, tor)
   Alt              Alternative hierarchy, simpler rules for
                    creating a group, no formal structure
                    (e.g., the hierarchy alt)
   Non-commercial   Only for personal use; commercial use is prohibited
                    (e.g., the hierarchy de)
   Commercial       Commercial use permitted (e.g., the hierarchy biz)
   Organization     Hierarchy bound to an organization
                    (e.g., the hierarchy gnu)
   --------------   ---------------------------------------------------

6.7.  PGP Keys

   PGP keys for Ctrl-PGP-Key and Mod-PGP-Key are transmitted in the
   following structure:

   PGP-answer = &quot;V&quot; SP Version CRLF
                &quot;U&quot; SP User-ID CRLF
                &quot;B&quot; SP Bits CRLF
                &quot;I&quot; SP Key-ID CRLF
                &quot;F&quot; SP Finger CRLF
                *(&quot;L&quot; SP Location CRLF)
                *(&quot;K-&quot; Keyblock CRLF)
                &quot;K&quot; SP Keyblock CRLF

   Version  = text
   User-ID  = text
   Bits     = text
   Key-ID   = text
   Finger   = text
   Location = text
   Keyblock = text

   Key   Name        Mandatory   Description
   ---   ---------   ---------   --------------------------------------
   K     Keyblock    yes         Public key block in ASCII armor format
                                 [RFC2440]
   V     Version     yes         PGP-Version
   U     User-ID     no          Key user id
   B     Bits        no          Number of bits
   I     Key-ID      no          Key id, without leading &quot;0x&quot;
   F     Finger      no          Fingerprint
   L     Location    no          URL that points to the public key
   ---   ---------   ---------   --------------------------------------

   A hyphen following the code indicates that the block is continued on
   the next line.  In the last message row, there MUST be white space
   after the code; this is also true for a single line code.

7.  Specification of the NAS Protocol (UDP)

   UDP is intended for reading programs (news readers); it is not in the
   scope of this document.  The use of UDP for NAS will be described in
   a separate paper.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has registered the application/nasdata media type as defined
   by the following information:

   Media type name:     application
   Media subtype name:  nasdata
   Required parameters: none
   Optional parameters: level

                        The NAS protocol level number for the enclosed
                        NAS data package.  If not present, the
                        protocol level defaults to 1.

   Encoding scheme: NAS data is plain text; no special encodings are
   needed.

   Security considerations: see below

9.  Security Considerations

   Security issues are only addressed in respect to server-server
   communication in this protocol level.  Username and password
   combinations in the GETA and GETP commands can be used to make sure
   that connections are only accepted from authorized clients.  PGP keys
   according to [RFC2440] are used to sign NAS data in server-server
   communication in order to validate that the data is authentic and has
   not been tampered with.

   Every server does have the possibility (in both server-server and
   server-client communication) to deny some commands or the whole
   connection according to the client&#x27;s IP number.

   No mechanisms are defined in the current protocol level to allow a
   client to validate that it is talking to a legitimate server or that
   the data it receives is authentic.

   A stronger authentication scheme will be provided in a higher
   protocol level.
