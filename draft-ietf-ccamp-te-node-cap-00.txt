Abstract 
    
   It is highly desired in several cases, to take into account Traffic 
   Engineering (TE) node capabilities during TE LSP path selection, such 
   as for instance the capability to act as a branch LSR of a P2MP LSP. 
   This requires advertising these capabilities within the IGP. 
   For that purpose, this document specifies OSPF and IS-IS traffic 
   engineering extensions for the advertisement of control plane and 
   data plane traffic engineering node capabilities.

3. Introduction 
    
   MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) routing ([IS-IS-TE], [OSPF-TE]) 
   relies on extensions to link state IGP routing protocols ([OSPF], 
   [IS-IS]) in order to carry Traffic Engineering (TE) link information 
   used for constraint based routing. Further Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) 
   related routing extensions are defined in [IS-IS-G] and [OSPF-G].  
    
   It is desired to complement these routing extensions in order to 
   carry TE node capabilities, in addition to TE link information. These 
   TE node capabilities will be taken into account as constraints during 
   path selection. 
   Indeed, it is useful to advertise data plane TE node capabilities, 
   such as, for instance the capability to be a branch LSR or a bud-LSR 
   of a P2MP LSP. These capabilities are then taken into account as 
   constraints when computing TE LSP paths. 
   It is also useful to advertise control plane TE node capabilities 
   such as for instance the capability to support GMPLS  
   signaling for a packet LSR, or the capability to support P2MP (Point 
   to Multipoint) TE LSP signaling.  This allows selecting a path that 
   avoids nodes that do not support a given signaling feature, or 
   triggering a mechanism to support such nodes. Hence this facilitates 
   backward compatibility. 
    
   For that purpose, this document specifies IGP (OSPF and IS-IS) 
   traffic engineering node capability TLVs in order to advertise data 
   plane and control plane capabilities of a node. 
    
   A new TLV is defined for ISIS and OSPF: the TE Node Capability 
   Descriptor TLV, to be carried within: 
        - the ISIS Capability TLV ([ISIS-CAP]) for ISIS 
        - the Router Information LSA ([OSPF-CAP]), for OSPF. 
    
     
    
4. TE Node Capability Descriptor  
 
4.1. Description 
 
   LSRs in a network may have distinct control plane and data plane  
   Traffic Engineering capabilities. The TE Node Capability Descriptor  
   information defined in this document describes data and control plane 
   capabilities of an LSR. Such information can be used for instance 
   during path computation so as to avoid nodes that do not support a 
   given TE feature either in the control or data plane or to trigger 
   procedure to handle these nodes. In some cases, this may also be 
   useful to ensure backward compatibility.

4.2. Required Information 
    
   The TE Node Capability Descriptor contains two variable length sets 
   of bit flags: 
        -The Data Plane Capabilities: This a variable length  
   set of bit flags where each bit corresponds to a given TE data plane 
   capability.  
        -The Control Plane Capabilities: This a variable length  
   set of bit flags where each bit corresponds to a given TE control 
   plane capability.  
              
   Two Data Plane Capabilities are currently defined: 
            -B bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR can act  
             as a branch node on a P2MP LSP (see [P2MP-REQ]) and [RSVP- 
             P2MP]).  
            -E bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR can act  
             as a bud LSR on a P2MP LSP, i.e. an LSR that is both  
             transit and egress.  
              
   Three Control Plane Capabilities are currently defined:   
            -M bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR supports  
             MPLS-TE signaling ([RSVP-TE]).         
            -G bit: when set this flag indicates that the LSR supports  
             GMPLS signaling ([RSVP-G]).  
            -P bit: when set, this flag indicates that the LSR supports  
             P2MP MPLS-TE signaling ([RSVP-P2MP]).  
              
   Note that new capabilities may be added in the future if required. 
    
   Note that bits numbers are under IANA control.

5. OSPF TE extensions 
    
5.1. OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV format  
    
   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is made of various non 
   ordered sub-TLVs.  
   The format of the OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV and its sub-
   TLVs is the same as the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering 
   Extensions to OSPF [OSPF-TE]. That is, the TLV is composed of 2 
   octets for the type, 2 octets specifying the TLV length and a value 
   field.   
   The TLV is padded to four-octet alignment; padding is not included in 
   the length field (so a three octet value would have a length of 
   three, but the total size of the TLV would be eight octets).  Nested 
   TLVs are also 32-bit aligned.  Unrecognized types are ignored.  All 
   types between 32768 and 65535 are reserved for vendor-specific 
   extensions.  All other undefined type codes are reserved for future 
   assignment by IANA.  
    
   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV has the following format:  
        
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
   |              Type             |             Length            | 
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
   |                                                               |  
   //                            sub-TLVs                          //          
   |                                                               |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
    
              
         Type     To be defined by IANA 
         Length   Variable 
         Value    This comprises one or more sub-TLVs  
    
   Currently two sub-TLVs are defined:                   
            Sub-TLV type  Length               Name   
                1      variable     DATA-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV   
                2      variable     CONTROL-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV  
                       
   Any non recognized sub-TLV MUST be silently ignored.   
   More sub-TLVs could be added in the future to handle new 
   capabilities. 
 
   The OSPF TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is carried within an OSPF 
   router information LSA which is defined in [OSPF-CAP].

                  significant to the least significant, where each bit  
                  represents one data plane TE node capability.  When   
                  the first 32 capabilities are defined, a new   
                  capability flag will be used to accommodate the next

   Router information opaque LSA (opaque type of 4, opaque ID of 0) 
   which is defined in [OSPF-CAP].  
        
   A router MUST originate a new OSPF router information LSA whenever  
   the content of any of the carried TLVs changes or whenever  
   required by the regular OSPF procedure (LSA refresh (every  
   LSRefreshTime)).  
      
   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV advertises capabilities that 
   are taken into account as constraints during path selection. Hence 
   its flooding scope is area-local, and MUST be carried within a type 
   10 router information LSA.  
 
   TE Node Capability Descriptor TLVs are OPTIONAL. When an OSPF LSA 
   does not contain any TE Node capability Descriptor TLV, this means 
   that the TE Capabilities of that LSR are unknown.   
 
   Note that a change in any of these capabilities MAY trigger CSPF    
   computation, but MUST not trigger normal SPF computation.

6. IS-IS TE Extensions 
 
6.1. IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV format 
    
   The IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is made of various non 
   ordered sub-TLVs.  
    
   The format of the IS-IS TE Node Capability TLV and its sub-TLVs is 
   the same as the TLV format used by the Traffic Engineering Extensions 
   to IS-IS [ISIS-TE]. That is, the TLV is composed of 1 octet for the   
   type, 1 octet specifying the TLV length and a value field.   
    
   The IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV has the following format:  
        
      TYPE: To be assigned by IANA   
      LENGTH: Variable, from 3 to 255 
      VALUE: set of one or more sub-TLVs 
 
   Currently two sub-TLVs are defined:                   
               Sub-TLV type  Length               Name   
                  1         variable     DATA-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV   
                  2         variable     CONTROL-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV  
                       
   Any non recognized sub-TLV MUST be silently ignored.   
   More sub-TLVs could be added in the future to handle new 
   capabilities.  
 
   The IS-IS TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV is carried within an IS-
   IS CAPABILITY TLV which is defined in [ISIS-CAP]. 
    
6.1.1. DATA-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV  
           
   The DATA-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV is a series of bit flags, where each bit 
   correspond to a data plane TE node capability, and has a variable 
   length. These bits are under IANA control.      
 
   The DATA-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV has the following format:  
        
      TYPE: To be assigned by IANA (Suggested value =1)   
      LENGTH: It is set to N. N starts from 1 and can be increased when  
              there is a need. Each octet is referred to as a  
              capability flag. 
      VALUE: This comprises one or more data plane TE node capability   
             flags.  
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
 
 
Vasseur, Le Roux, et al.                                     [Page 10] 
  
Internet Draft   draft-ietf-ccamp-te-node-cap-00.txt    November 2005 


   The following bits in the first capability flag are to be assigned by 
   IANA: 
    
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
   |B|E| Reserved  |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
       
   B bit: P2MP Branch node capability: When set this indicates  
          that the LSR can act as a branch node on a P2MP LSP     
          [P2MP-REQ]  
   E bit: P2MP bud-LSR capability: When set, this indicates  
          that the LSR can act as a bud LSR on a P2MP LSP, i.e. an  
          LSR that is both transit and egress [P2MP-REQ].  
    
   Reserved bits are for future assignment by IANA 
    
 
6.1.2. CONTROL-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV  
           
   The CONTROL-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV is a series of bit flags, where each 
   bit correspond to a control plane TE node capability, and has a 
   variable length. These bits are under IANA control.      
 
   The CONTROL-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV has the following format:  
        
      TYPE: To be assigned by IANA (suggested value = 2)  
      LENGTH: It is set to N. N starts from 1 and can be increased   
              when there is a need. Each octet is referred to as a  
              capability flag. 
      VALUE: This comprises one or more control plane TE node capability    
             flags.  
 
   The following bits in the first capability flag are to be assigned by 
   IANA. 
    
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
   |M|G|P|Reserved |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
       
    -M bit: If set this indicates that the LSR supports MPLS-TE  
            signaling ([RSVP-TE]).  
             
    -G bit: If set this indicates that the LSR supports GMPLS signaling    
            ([RSVP-G]).  
           
    -P bit: If set this indicates that the LSR supports P2MP MPLS-TE   
            signaling ([RSVP-P2MP]).  
    
     Reserved bits are for future assignment by IANA.

6.2. Elements of procedure 
 
   The TE Node Capability TLV is carried within an IS-IS CAPABILITY TLV 
   defined in [IS-IS-CAP].  
    
   An IS-IS router MUST originate a new IS-IS LSP whenever the content  
   of any of the TE Node Capability TLV changes or whenever required by 
   the regular IS-IS procedure (LSP refresh).  
 
   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV advertises capabilities that 
   are taken into account as constraints during path selection. Hence 
   its flooding is area-local, and MUST be carried within an IS-IS 
   CAPABILITY TLV having the S flag cleared.  
    
   TE Node Capability Descriptor TLVs are OPTIONAL. When a IS-IS LSP  
   does not contain any TE Node capability Descriptor TLV, this means 
   that the TE Capabilities of that LSR are unknown.  
    
   Note that a change in any of these capabilities MAY trigger CSPF    
   computation, but MUST not trigger normal SPF computation. 
     
                  
7. Backward compatibility 
    
   The TE Node Capability Descriptor TLVs defined in this document do 
   not introduce any interoperability issue. For OSPF, a router not 
   supporting the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV SHOULD just silently 
   ignore the TLV as specified in RFC2370. For IS-IS a router not 
   supporting the TE Node Capability Descriptor TLV SHOULD just silently 
   ignore the TLV. 
    
8. Security Considerations 
 
   No new security issues are raised in this document. 
    
9. IANA considerations  
 
9.1. OSPF TLVs 
 
   IANA will assign a new codepoint for the TE Node Capability 
   Descriptor TLV defined in this document and carried within the Router 
   Information LSA. 
    
   Two sub-TLVs types are defined for this TLV and should be assigned by 
   IANA: 
        -CONTROL-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV (suggested value =1) 
        -DATA-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV (suggested value =2)

Internet Draft   draft-ietf-ccamp-te-node-cap-00.txt    November 2005 


9.2. ISIS TLVs 
    
   IANA will assign a new codepoint for the TE Node Capability 
   Descriptor TLV defined in this document, and carried within the ISIS 
   CAPABILITY TLV. 
    
   Two sub-TLVs types are defined for this TLV and should be assigned by 
   IANA: 
        -CONTROL-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV (suggested value =1) 
        -DATA-PLANE-CAP sub-TLV (suggested value =2) 
 
9.3. Capability bits 
 
   IANA is requested to manage the space of control plane and data plane 
   capability bit flags, numbering them in the usual IETF notation 
   starting at zero and continuing at least through 31. 
   New bit numbers may be allocated only by an IETF Consensus action. 
   Each bit should be tracked with the following qualities: 
      - Bit number 
      - Defining RFC 
      - Name of bit 
       
   Currently two bits are defined in the data plane capability flags. 
   Here are the suggested values: 
      -0x01: P2MP Branch LSR capability 
      -0x02: P2MP Bud LSR capability 
    
   Currently three bits are defined in the control plane capability 
   flags. Here are the suggested values: 
      -0x01: MPLS-TE support 
      -0x02: GMPLS support 
      -0x04: P2MP RSVP-TE support
