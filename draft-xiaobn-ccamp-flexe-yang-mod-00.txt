               A YANG Data Model for Flex Ethernet(FlexE)
                  draft-xiaobn-ccamp-flexe-yang-mod-00

Abstract

   Flex Ethernet(FlexE) implementation agreement have been published by
   OIF.  FlexE provides a generic mechanism for supporting a variety of
   Ethernet MAC rates that may or may not correspond to any existing
   Ethernet PHY rate.

   This document describes a YANG data model for FlexE.  It can be used
   to manage and control devices supporting FlexE functions.

1.  Introduction

   Flex Ethernet (FlexE) implementation agreement version 1.0
   [OIFFLEXE1] and 2.0 [OIFFLEXE2] have been published by OIF.  FlexE
   provides a generic mechanism for supporting a variety of Ethernet MAC
   rates that may or may not correspond to any existing Ethernet PHY
   rate.  This includes MAC rates that are both greater than (through
   bonding) and less than (through sub-rate and channelization) the
   Ethernet PHY rates used to carry FlexE.

   This document defines a date model of FlexE, using YANG[RFC7950].
   This model mainly deals with the data model of the FlexE Group and
   the FlexE client.  It can be used by an application to configure and
   modify the parameters of the FlexE Group and the FlexE client, and to
   receive notifications, e.g. mismatch errors, from devices supporting
   FlexE functions.

   Requirements for the FlexE YANG model are considered.  And FlexE YANG
   tree and YANG files are given.

2.  Terminology

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in the YANG data tree
   presented later in this document is defined in [RFC8340].  They are
   provided below for reference.

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

   o  Some of the key terms used in this document are listed as follow.

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  FlexE terminology used in this document

   a.  CSG: Calendar Slot Granularity.  It can be 5G or 25G.

   b.  FlexE Calendar: In FlexE IA v1.0, the total capacity of a FlexE
       Group is represented as a collection of slots which have a
       granularity of 5G.  The calendar for a FlexE Group composed of n
       100G PHYs is represented as an array of 20n slots (each
       representing 5G of bandwidth).  This calendar is partitioned into
       sub-calendars, with 20 slots per 100G PHY.  Each FlexE client is
       mapped into one or more calendar slots (based on the bandwidth
       the FlexE client flow will need).  In FlexE IA v2.0[OIFFLEXE2],
       the total capacity of a FlexE Group is represented as a
       collection of slots which may have a granularity of 5G or 25G.
       The calendar for a FlexE Group composed of n 100G FlexE instances
       from m 100G/200G/400G PHYs is represented as an array of 20n
       slots (each representing 5G of bandwidth) or 4n slots (25G
       granularity).

Internet-Draft              FlexE yang model                  March 2019


   c.  FlexE Client: An Ethernet flow based on a MAC data rate that may
       or may not correspond to any Ethernet PHY rate.

   d.  FlexE Group: A FlexE Group is composed of from 1 to n 100G FlexE
       Instances that are carried by a group of from 1 to m bonded
       Ethernet PHYs.

   e.  FlexE instance: A 100G FlexE Instance is a unit of information
       consisting of 100G of capacity able to carry FlexE Client data,
       together with its associated overhead.

   Detailed description of these terms can be found in [OIFFLEXE1] and
   [OIFFLEXE2] .

3.  FlexE Reference Configuration Model

   FlexE can be implemented between the FlexE mux and demux in two end
   devices connected directly by the FlexE links.  In this case, FlexE
   is just a link connection technology.

   FlexE can also be transported by transport networks.  There are three
   kinds of transport network mapping mechanisms for FlexE signals, that
   is, FlexE unaware transport, FlexE termination in the transport
   network and FlexE aware transport.

   How to configure the ingress or egress of transport network about
   FlexE mapping relationship may be application specific.  In this
   document, the part of YANG data model for the transport network
   mapping for FlexE is not included at present.

4.  Requirements

4.1.  Requirements

   This section summarizes the management requirements for the FlexE
   Group and the FlexE Client.

   Req-1 The model SHALL support the management of the FlexE Group,
   consisting of one or more 100G FlexE instances which carried by one
   or more 100GE, 200GE, 400GE Ethernet PHY(s).

   The detailed management covers the CURD functions (create, update,
   read and delete), and lock/unlock.

   Req-2 The model SHOULD be able to verify that the collection of
   Ethernet PHY(s) included in a FlexE Group have the same
   characteristics (e.g. number of PHYs, rate of PHYs, etc.) at the

   local FlexE shims.  If inconsistency exists, notifications (e.g.
   errors) SHOULD be invoked.

   Req-3 The model SHOULD be able to verify that the collection of FlexE
   instances included in a FlexE Group have the same characteristics
   (e.g. calendar slot granularity, unequipped slots, etc.) at the local
   FlexE shims.  If inconsistency exists, notifications (e.g. errors)
   SHOULD be invoked.

   Req-4 The model SHALL allow the addition (or removal) of one or more
   FlexE clients on a FlexE Group.  The addition (or removal) of a FlexE
   client flow SHALL NOT affect the services for the other FlexE client
   signals whose size and calendar slot assignments are not changed.

   Req-5 The model SHALL allow FlexE client signals to flexibly span the
   set of FlexE instances which comprise the FlexE Group.

   Req-6 The model SHALL support a FlexE client flow resizing without
   affecting any existing FlexE clients within the same FlexE Group.

   Req-7 The model SHALL support the switching of a calendar
   configuration.  There are two calendar configurations, A and B.

   This document registers the following YANG modules in the YANG Module
   Names registry[RFC6020] :

   name: ietf-flexe-yang

   namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-flexe-yang

   reference: RFC XXXX (TDB)

12.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF[RFC6241].  Proper standardized security measures should be
   implemented.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable.  These data nodes may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
   operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data nodes without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
