Abstract 
    
   This document provides the mechanism for the autoconfiguration of 
   recursive DNS server in mobile node and the optimization of DNS name 
   resolution in the hierarchical mobile IPv6 network.  Whenever the 
   mobile node moves into a new MAP domain, the region managed by 
   another MAP, in the hierarchical mobile IPv6 network, it detects the 
   addresses of recursive DNS servers which are placed in the region and 
   replaces the old ones with the new ones for DNS name resolution.  
   This allows the time for DNS name resolution much reduced by using 
   the nearest recursive DNS server which exists in the region.  
   Therefore, the mechanism of this document can optimize the DNS name 
   resolution.

1. Terminology 
    
   This memo uses the terminology described in [3].  In addition, a new 
   term is defined below: 
    
    Recursive DNS Server (RDNSS)   A name server that offers the 
                                   recursive service of DNS name 
                                   resolution. 
    
2. Introduction 
    
   RFC 2462 [4] provides a way to autoconfigure either fixed or mobile 
   nodes with one or more IPv6 addresses and default routes. 
    
   For the support of the various services in the Internet, not only the 
   configuration of IP address in network interface, but also that of 
   the recursive DNS server for DNS name resolution are necessary. 
    
   Up to now, many mechanisms to autoconfigure recursive DNS server in 
   nodes have been proposed [5][6]. 
    
   This document suggests not only the autoconfiguration of recursive 
   DNS server in mobile node that moves within the hierarchical mobile 
   IPv6 network [3], but also the optimization of the DNS name 
   resolution in such a network.  Whenever the mobile node moves into a 
   new MAP (Mobility Anchor Point) domain, the region managed by another 
   MAP, in the hierarchical mobile IPv6 network, it detects the 
   addresses of recursive DNS servers which are placed in the region and

   replaces the old ones with the new ones for DNS name resolution.  
   This allows the time for DNS name resolution much reduced by using 
   the nearest recursive DNS server which exists in the region.  Like 
   this, because the mobile nodes can use the recursive DNS server in 
   the same domain instead of the fixed recursive DNS server, the DNS 
   name resolution for the mobile nodes can be optimized.

      Figure 1. Optimization of DNS Name Resolution in HMIPv6 Domain 
    
   Whenever a mobile node enters into another MAP domain of the visited 
   network, it receives a Router Advertisement (RA) message including 
   MAP option from Access Router (AR) and performs the local binding 
   update with the new MAP.  If the list of the addresses of the 
   recursive DNS server (RDNSS) is included in the RA message with the 
   MAP option, the mobile node can detect the new RDNSSes and select one 
   of them for the DNS name resolution.  Like Figure 1, this scheme can 
   reduce considerably the time of the name resolution between the 
   mobile node and RDNSS.  Because the mobile node uses the nearest

   RDNSS in the same MAP domain, RDNSS2 or RDNSS3, instead of the RDNSS 
   in its home network, RDNSS1.  When the mobile node moves into another 
   MAP domain, it replaces the old RDNSS(es) with the new RDNSS(es) for 
   the succeeding name resolutions. 
    
4. HMIPv6 Extension - Advertisement of Recursive DNS Server 
    
   Because this document considers only router advertisement for MAP 
   discovery, all ARs belonging to the MAP domain MUST advertise the 
   MAP's IP address and list of the RDNSS addresses. 
    
   The information of the RDNSS(es) in the MAP domain is stored in the 
   MAP by the network administrator and advertised as a new option with 
   MAP option through the RA message.  There MAY be more than one RDNSS 
   in a MAP domain.  In this case, the MAP advertises RA message 
   including the list of RDNSSes in the same domain with MAP option 
   periodically.  The RA message with MAP and RDNSS options is 
   propagated from the MAP to the mobile node through certain 
   (configured) router interfaces within the hierarchy of routers.  This  
   requires the manual configuration of the MAP and RDNSS options in the 
   MAP and also the routers, receiving the MAN and RDNSS options, MUST 
   allow themselves to propagate the options on certain interfaces. 
    
   Finally, whenever the mobile node listening to RA messages receives 
   the new RA message, it checks if the MAP is new or not.  If the MAP 
   is a new one, the mobile node perceives it has moved into another MAP 
   domain and performs both the local binding update with the new MAP 
   and the update of the list of RDNSSes in the configuration for DNS 
   name resolution with the new ones.  From the next name resolution, 
   the mobile node uses the new RDNSSes. 
    
5. Neighbor Discovery Extension - RDNSS Option Message Format 
    
   The mechanism of this document needs a new option in Neighbor 
   Discovery [7]. Figure 2 shows the format of RDNSS option message.

                      The value 0 is invalid.  Nodes MUST silently 
                      discard an ND packet that contains an option with 
                      length zero.

                      integer.  A decimal value of 15 indicates the 
                      highest preference.  A decimal value of 0 
                      indicates that the RDNSS cannot be used. 
    
      IPv6 Address of RDNSS 
                      The RDNSS's IPv6 address.  The scope of the 
                      address SHOULD be global.  The prefix length of 
                      the address is /64. 
    
   When advertising more than one RDNSS, as many RDNSS options as the 
   number of RDNSSes are included in an RA message. 
    
6. RDNSS Selection by Mobile Node 
    
   When a mobile node perceives multiple RDNSSes through RA message, it 
   stores the addresses of the RDNSSes in order into the configuration 
   which the resolver on the node uses for DNS name resolution on the 
   basis of the value of "Pref" field and the prefix of "IPv6 Address of 
   RDNSS" field in the RDNSS option.  The following algorithm is simply 
   based on the rule of selecting the nearest possible RDNSS from the 
   mobile node, providing that its preference value did not reach the 
   maximum value of 15.  When the distances are the same, this algorithm 
   uses the preference value to order the RDNSSes.  The mobile node 
   operation is shown below: 
    
    1) Receive and parse all RDNSS options. 
    
    2) Arrange RDNSSes in an ascending order, starting with the nearest 
       RDNSS and store them in the configuration for DNS name

Internet-Draft        DNS Autoconfiguration in HMIPv6        June 2003 
 
 
       resolution used by resolver.  For example, the longest prefix 
       matching between the "IPv6 Address of RDNSS" field and mobile 
       node's On-link CoA (LCoA) MAY be used to decide the distance 
       between mobile node and RDNSS, how far away the mobile node is 
       from the RDNSS. 
    
    3) For each RDNSS entry, check the following; 
       If the value of "Pref" field is set to zero, exclude the RDNSS 
       entry from the list of RDNSSes of the configuration for DNS name 
       resolution. 
    
   Whenever the resolver on the mobile node performs the name resolution, 
   it refers to the address(es) of RDNSS in the configuration for name 
   resolution according to the current rule of selecting an RDNSS, 
   namely from the 1st RDNSS among the RDNSSes ordered in the 
   configuration.  For example, in Figure 1, when a mobile node (MN) 
   moves into another subnet managed by access router AR2, MN uses 
   RDNSS3 in the same subnet instead of RDNSS2 for name resolution. 
    
   As a last resort for name resolution, each mobile node SHOULD 
   maintain the address(es) of the RDNSS(es) at its home network in the 
   tail of the list of RDNSS addresses. 
    
   In the case that there are no available RDNSSes for name resolution 
   at a new MAP domain that a mobile node visits, the node can the 
   RDNSSes of the previous MAP domain or of its home network for name 
   resolution. 
    
7. Detection of RDNSS Failure 
    
   A MAP placed in a MAP domain checks periodically if the RDNSSes 
   registered in the MAP are alive.  Whenever the MAP detects the 
   failure of any RDNSS, it advertises the failure down to the hierarchy 
   with a new RA message including an RDNSS option of which "Pref" field 
   has zero for the RDNSS.  When a mobile node receives the RA message, 
   it perceives that the RDNSS is out of work or the path to the RDNSS 
   is broken and excludes the RDNSS from the configuration for name 
   resolution. 
    
   The dynamic detection of RDNSS failure in a MAP can be done by simply 
   pinging the RDNSS periodically (e.g., every ten seconds).  If no 
   response is received, the MAP MAY try to aggressively ping the RDNSS 
   for a short period of time (e.g., once every 5 seconds for 15 
   seconds).  If any response cannot be received, an RDNSS option for 
   the RDNSS MAY be sent with a preference value of zero.

   In order to guarantee the secure communication between routers, the 
   router advertisements sent between routers SHOULD be authenticated by 
   AH or ESP [3].  This security is essentially related to Neighbor 
   Discovery protocol security [7].
