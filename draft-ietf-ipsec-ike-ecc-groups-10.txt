                               Abstract

   This document describes additional elliptic curve groups for use
   in IKE (as defined in RFC 2409) and IKEv2 (as defined in RFC 3406).
   These groups are defined to align IKE and IKEv2 with other ECC
   implementations and standards, and in addition, many of them
   provide higher strength than the previousley defined Oakley
   groups.

1.  Introduction

This document describes groups for use in elliptic curve
Diffie-Hellman in IKE in addition to the Oakley groups included in
[IKE], [IKEv2], and [MODP-IKE].  The document assumes that the reader
is familiar with the IKE protocol and the concept of Oakley Groups, as
defined in RFC 2409 [IKE] and IKEv2 [IKEv2].  The ECC groups given
here are among the fifteen groups that NIST recommends in FIPS 186-2
[FIPS-186-2].

INTERNET-DRAFT   Additional ECC Groups for IKE and IKEv2   January 2006

RFC2409 [IKE] defines five standard Oakley Groups - three modular
exponentiation groups and two elliptic curve groups over GF[2^N].  One
modular exponentiation group (768 bits - Oakley Group 1) is mandatory
for all implementations to support, while the other four are optional.
Both elliptic curve groups (Oakley Groups 3 and 4) are defined over
GF[2^N] with N composite.

Additional groups that can be used with IKE and IKEv2 are defined in
[MODP-IKE].

This document describes all fifteen elliptic curve groups recommended
by NIST in [FIPS-186-2].

The reasons for supporting the 15 NIST ellipitc curve groups are for
better alignment with other standards, such as [FIPS 186-2], [X9.62],
[X9.63], and [SEC-2].  Some of these groups also afford efficiency
advantages in hardware applications since the underlying arithmetic is
binary field arithmetic.  The groups described are capable of providing
security consistent with both the new Advanced Encryption Standard
[FIPS-197] and with Triple DES [SP-800-67].

These groups could also be defined with the New Group Mode but
including them in this document will encourage interoperability of IKE
and IKEv2 implementations based on elliptic curve groups.

2.  The Additional Elliptic Curve Groups

The groups given in this document are capable of providing security
consistent with AES keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits, and also with 3DES
keys of lengths 168, whose corresponding strengths is often rated at
112 bits.  Additionally a lower security level, of 80 bits, is also
supported for backwards compatability.  The following table, based on
tables from [HOF] and [LEN], gives approximate comparable key sizes
for security stregnths for selected ECC key sizes by comparison
symmetric key sizes.  The estimates are based on the running times of
the best algorithms known today.

                      Strength  ECC2N  ECP 
                      --------  -----  ---
                         80      163   192   
                        112      233   224   
                        128      283   256   
                        192      409   384   
                        256      571   521   
          
                  Table 1: Comparable key sizes
     
Thus, for example, when securing a 192-bit symmetric key, it is
prudent to use either 409-bit ECC2N or 384-bit ECP.  With smaller ECC
key sizes the symmetric keys would be underprotected.

INTERNET-DRAFT   Additional ECC Groups for IKE and IKEv2   January 2006

The fifteen groups described in this document use elliptic curves over
GF[2^N] with N prime or over GF[P] with P prime.  This addresses
concerns expressed by many experts regarding curves defined over
GF[2^N] with N composite -- concerns highlighted by the recent attacks
on such curves due to Gaudry, Hess, and Smart [WEIL] and due to
Jacobson, Menezes and Stein [JMS].

Seven of the groups described here have been assigned identifiers by
IANA [IANA] and the remaining eight might later be assigned
identifiers by IANA.  A brief summary of the IANA identified groups
for IKE follows.  Groups with IANA numbers 1 through 4 are identified
in [IKE].  The group with IANA number 5 is identified in [MODP-IKE].
The group with IANA number 6, [X9.62] and [SEC 2], with object
identifier sect163r1, but it is not one of the fifteen curves that
NIST recommends [FIPS-186-2].  Nevertheless, it is included here for
backwards interoperability with existing implementations.  The
remaining NIST recommended groups are suggested and anticipated to be
assigned IANA numbers as specified in Table 2.

Generally, three curves are defined at each strength.  Two curves
chosen verifiably at random, which helps security in that the elliptic
curve is thereby unlikely to belong to some rare but weak classe of
curves.  One verifiably random is defined over a prime field, and
another over a prime field.  The third curve is Koblitz curve defined
over a binary field.  These curves are special curves with some
efficient implementation properties due to the special structure of
the curve [KOB] and [SOL].  Generally speaking, curves defined over
prime field are more efficient than those over binary fields when
implemented software, because typical platforms for software have
built-in 32-bit integer multipliers or better.  In hardware
implementations, binary fields potentially offer more efficient
implementation.

For elliptic curve groups, the data in the KE payload when using this
group is the octet string representation specified in [SEC1], [X9.62],
[X9.63], [FIPS-186-2], and [IEEE-1363] of the point on the curve
chosen by taking the randomly chosen secret Ka and computing Ka*G,
where * is the repetition of the group addition.

In this representation, a leading octet with value 02,03, or 04,
indicates whether the point is compressed and uncompressed, and if
compressed, which of the two choices for the y-coordinate.  The
coordinates are represented as octet strings consisting of initial
padding of zero bits, if needed, followed by a bit string of length
corresponding to the field size.  For binary fields, a polynomial
basis representation is used, with irreducible polynomials specified
in this document in the corresponding subsection describing the group.

If the initiator chooses secret i and the responder chooses secret r,
then the KEi is i*G and KEr is r*G.  The formatting of KEr is
identical to that for KEi.

The raw shared secret is the x-coordinate (only) of (ir)*G, using the
same representation of field elements as octet strings that is used
the x-coordinate inside of KEi and KEr.

Implementations of this document MUST support one of the groups in
Table 2.  The groups in Table 2 are arranged to 5 classes,
corresponding to approximately equivalent security strength.  To
encourage interoperability, implementations that support one of these
classes, SHOULD support the one group in that class that is defined
over a prime field (which will be one of P-192, P-224, P-256, P-384,
or P-521).  Implementations SHOULD support one of P-256 or P-384.
Implementations MAY support any set of groups.
 

The groups are now described in greater detail.  The order follows the
proposed id number of the group, which does match not the order of
Table 2 (based on security) for historical reasons.

However, for historical reasons, the method to generate the group from
the seed differs slightly from the method described in

4. Security Considerations

Since this document describes some groups for use within IKE and
IKEv2, many of the security considerations contained within RFC 2409
apply here as well.

Many of the groups described in this document offer higher strength
than the groups in RFC 2409.  This allows the IKE and IKEv2 to offer
security comparable with the AES algorithms.

In addition, since all the groups are defined over GF[P] with P prime
or GF[2^N] with N prime, they address the concerns expressed regarding
the elliptic curve groups included in RFC 2409, which are curves
defined over GF[2^N] with N composite.  The work of Gaudry, Hess, and
Smart [WEIL] reveal some of the weaknesses in such groups.

5. IANA Considerations

It is propose that the id column Table 2 be defined as the IANA
numbers that MUST be used in IKE and IKEv2 to identify the groups
specified in this document.

6. Intellectual Property Rights

The IETF has been notified of intellectual property rights claimed in
regard to the specification contained in this document.
For more information, consult the online list of claimed rights
(http://www.ietf.org/ipr.html).
