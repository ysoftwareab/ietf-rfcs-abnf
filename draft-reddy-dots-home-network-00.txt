Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Signal Channel Call Home
                    draft-reddy-dots-home-network-00

Abstract

   This document presents DOTS signal channel Call Home service, which
   enables a DOTS server to initiate a secure connection to a DOTS
   client, and to receive the attack traffic information from the DOTS
   client.  The DOTS server in turn uses the attack traffic information
   to identify the compromised devices launching the outgoing DDOS
   attack and takes appropriate mitigation action.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  The Problem

   The DOTS signal channel protocol [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel] is
   used to carry information about a network resource or a network (or a
   part thereof) that is under a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
   attack.  Such information is sent by a DOTS client to one or multiple
   DOTS servers so that appropriate mitigation actions are undertaken on
   traffic deemed suspicious.  Various use cases are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases].

   IoT devices are becoming more and more prevalent in home networks,
   and with compute and memory becoming cheaper and cheaper, various
   types of IoT devices are available in the consumer market at
   affordable price.  But on the downside, the main threat being most of
   these IoT devices are bought off-the-shelf and most manufacturers
   haven't considered security in the product design.  IoT devices
   deployed in home networks can be easily compromised, they do not have
   easy mechanism to upgrade, and IoT manufactures may cease manufacture



Reddy, et al.            Expires April 19, 2019                 [Page 2]

   and/or discontinue patching vulnerabilities on IoT devices.  However,
   these vulnerable and compromised devices will continue be used for a
   long period of time in the home, and the end-user does not know that
   IoT devices in his/her home are compromised.  The compromised IoT
   devices are typically used for launching DDoS attacks on the victim
   while the owner/administrator of the home network is not aware about
   such misbehaviors.  Similar to other DDoS attack, the victim in this
   attack can be an application server, a host, a router, a firewall, or
   an entire network.

   Nowadays, network devices in a home network offer network security,
   for instance, firewall/IPS service on a home router or gateway to
   protect the devices connected to the home network from external and
   internal attacks.  Over the years several techniques have been
   identified to detect DDoS attacks, some of these techniques can be
   enabled on home network devices but most of them are used in the
   Internet Service Provider (ISP)'s network.  The ISP offering DDoS
   mitigation service can detect outgoing DDoS attack traffic
   originating from its subscribers or the ISP may receive filtering
   rules (for example, using BGP flowspec [RFC5575]) from downstream
   service provider to filter, block, or rate-limit DDoS attack traffic
   originating from the ISP's subscribers to the downstream target.

   Some of the DDoS attacks like spoofed RST or FIN packets, Slowloris,
   and TLS re-negotiation are difficult to detect on the home network
   devices without adversely affecting its performance.  The reason is
   typically home routers have fast path to boost the throughput.  For
   every new TCP/UDP flow, only the first few packets are punted through
   the slow path.  Hence, it is not possible to detect various DDoS
   attacks in the slow path, since the attack payload is sent to the
   target server after the flow is switched to fast path.  Deep packet
   inspection (DPI) of all the packets of a flow would be able to detect
   some of the attacks.  However, a full-fledged DPI to detect these
   type of DDoS attacks is functionally or operationally not possible
   for all the devices attached to the home network owing to the memory
   and CPU limitations of the home routers.  Further, for certain DDoS
   attacks the ability to distinguish legitimate traffic from attacker
   traffic on a per packet basis is complex.  This complexity originates
   from the fact that the packet itself may look "legitimate" and no
   attack signature can be identified.  The anomaly can be identified
   only after detailed statistical analysis.

   The ISP on the other hand can detect the DDoS attack originating from
   a home network, but the ISP does not have a mechanism to detect which
   device in the home network is generating the DDoS attack traffic.
   The primary reason being that devices in a IPv4 Home network are
   typically behind a NAT border.  Even in case of a IPv6 Home network,
   although the ISP can identify the infected device in the Home network



Reddy, et al.            Expires April 19, 2019                 [Page 3]

   launching the DDoS traffic by tracking its unique IPv6 address, the
   infected device can easily change the IP address to evade
   remediation.

   Existing approaches are still suffering from misused access network
   resources by abusing devices; the support of means for blocking such
   attacks close to the sources are missing.  In particular, the DOTS
   signal protocol do not discuss cooperative DDoS mitigation between
   the home network and ISP to the suppress the outbound DDoS attack
   traffic originating from the home network.

1.2.  The Solution

   This specification addresses the problems discussed in Section 1.1
   and presents DOTS signal channel Call Home extension, which enables
   the DOTS server to initiate a secure connection to the DOTS client,
   and the DOTS client then conveys the attack traffic information to
   the DOTS server.  The DOTS server uses the DDoS attack traffic
   information to identify the compromised device in its domain
   launching the DDoS attack, notifies the network administrator, and
   takes appropriate mitigation action.  The mitigation action can be to
   quarantine the compromised device or block its traffic to the attack
   target until the mitigation request is withdrawn.

   For instance, the DOTS server in the home network initiates the Call
   Home during peace time and then subsequently the DOTS client in the
   ISP environment can initiate mitigation requests whenever the ISP
   detects there is an attack from a compromised device in the DOTS
   server's domain.

2.  Notational Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader should be familiar with the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dots-requirements].

3.  DOTS Signal Channel Call Home

3.1.  Procedure

   DOTS signal channel Call Home preserves all but one of the DOTS
   client/server roles in the DOTS protocol stack, as compared to DOTS
   client-initiated DOTS signal channel protocol.  The one and only role



Reddy, et al.            Expires April 19, 2019                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            DOTS signal Call Home             October 2018


   reversal that occurs are at the TCP/TLS or DTLS layers; that is, the
   DOTS server acts as a DTLS client and the DOTS client acts as a DTLS
   server or the DOTS server acts as a TCP/TLS client and the DOTS
   client acts as a TCP/TLS server.  The DOTS server initiates TCP/TLS
   handshake or DTLS handshake to the DOTS client.

   For example, a home network element (e.g., home router) co-located
   with a DOTS server (likely, a client-domain DOTS gateway) is the TCP/
   TLS server and DTLS server.  However, when calling home, the DOTS
   server initially assumes the role of the TCP/TLS client and DTLS
   client, but the network element's role as a DOTS server remains the
   same.  Further, existing certificate chains and mutual authentication
   mechanisms between the DOTS agents are unaffected by Call Home
   function.  This Call Home function enables the DOTS server co-located
   with a network element (possibly behind NATs and firewalls) reachable
   by only the intended DOTS client and hence the DOTS server cannot be
   subjected to DDoS attacks.  Other motivations for introducing Call
   Home are discussed in Section 1.1 of [RFC8071].

   Figure 1 illustrates sample Call Home flow exchange:

                   DOTS                                DOTS
                  Server                              Client
                    |                                    |
                    |         1. (D)TLS connection       |
                    |----------------------------------->|

         Figure 1: DOTS Signal Channel Call Home Sequence Diagram

   This diagram makes the following points:

   1.  If UDP transport is used, the DOTS server begins by initiating a
       DTLS connection to the DOTS client.  The DOTS client MUST support
       accepting DTLS connection on the IANA-assigned port defined in
       Section 4.1, but MAY be configured to listen to a different port.
       If TCP is used, the DOTS server begins by initiating a TCP
       connection to the DOTS client.  The DOTS client MUST support
       accepting TCP connections on the IANA-assigned port defined in
       Section 4.1, but MAY be configured to listen to a different port.
       Using this TCP connection, the DOTS server initiates an TLS
       connection to the DOTS client.  The happy eyeballs mechanism
       explained in Section 4.3 of [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel] can be
       used for initiation of both TCP and UDP sessions.

   2.  Using this (D)TLS connection, the DOTS client requests,
       withdraws, or retrieves the status of mitigation requests.

3.2.  DOTS Signal Channel Extension

3.2.1.  Mitigation Request

   This specification extends the mitigation request defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel] to convey the attacker source prefixes
   and source port numbers.  The DOTS client in the mitigation request
   conveys the following new parameters in the CBOR body of the
   mitigation request:

   source-prefix:  A list of attacker prefixes used to attack the
      target.  Prefixes are represented using Classless Inter-Domain
      Routing (CIDR) notation [RFC4632].
      As a reminder, the prefix length MUST be less than or equal to 32
      (resp. 128) for IPv4 (resp.  IPv6).

      The prefix list MUST NOT include broadcast, loopback, or multicast
      addresses.  These addresses are considered as invalid values.  In
      addition, the DOTS client MUST validate that attacker prefixes are
      within the scope of the DOTS server's domain.

      This is an optional attribute.

   source-port-range:  A list of port numbers used by the attack traffic
      flows.

      A port range is defined by two bounds, a lower port number (lower-
      port) and an upper port number (upper-port).  When only 'lower-
      port' is present, it represents a single port number.

      For TCP, UDP, Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
      [RFC4960], or Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)
      [RFC4340], a range of ports can be, for example, 0-1023,
      1024-65535, or 1024-49151.

      This is an optional attribute.

   source-icmp-type:  A list of ICMP types used by the attack traffic
      flows.  A ICMP type range is defined by two bounds, a lower ICMP
      type number (lower-type) and an upper ICMP type number (upper-
      type).  When only 'lower-type' is present, it represents a single
      ICMP type number.  This is an optional attribute.

      This is an optional attribute.

Internet-Draft            DOTS signal Call Home             October 2018


   The 'source-prefix' and 'target-prefix' parameters are mandatory
   attributes when the attack traffic information is signaled by the
   DOTS client.  The 'target-uri' or 'target-fqdn' parameters can be
   included in the mitigation request for diagnostic purpose to notify
   the DOTS server domain administrator but SHOULD not be used to
   determine the target IP addresses.

   The DOTS server uses the attack traffic information to find the pre-
   NAT source IP address of the compromised device and blocks the
   traffic from the compromised device traffic to the attack target
   until the mitigation request is withdrawn.  The DOTS server domain
   administrator consent MAY be required to block the traffic from the
   compromised device to the attack target.  An implementation MAY have
   a configuration knob to block the traffic from the compromised device
   to the attack target with or without DOTS server domain administrator
   consent.  If the attack traffic is blocked, the DOTS server informs
   the DOTS client that the attack is being mitigated.

   If the attack traffic information is identified by the DOTS server or
   the DOTS server domain administrator as legitimate traffic, the
   mitigation request is rejected, and 4.09 (Conflict) is returned to
   the DOTS client.  The conflict-clause (defined in Section 4.4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel]) indicates the cause of the conflict.
   The following new value is defined:

   4: Mitigation request rejected.  This code is returned by the DOTS
      server to indicate the attack traffic has been classified as
      legitimate traffic.

   If the DOTS server is co-located with a home router, it can program
   the packet processor to punt all the traffic from the compromised
   device to the target to slow path.  The home router inspects the
   punted slow path traffic to detect and block the outgoing DDoS attack
   traffic or quarantine the device (e.g., using MAC level filtering)
   until it is remediated, and notifies the home administrator about the
   compromised device.

   TBD:

   a) Do we also want to convey Attack Name/type or ID (the home router
   may not be capable of detecting new emerging/sophisticated attacks) ?

   b) Is DOTS data channel Call Home service required (if required, can
   RESTCONF Call Home defined in RFC8071 be used) ?

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  DOTS Signal Channel Call Home UDP and TCP Port Number

   IANA is requested to assign the port number TBD to the DOTS signal
   channel Call Home protocol for both UDP and TCP from the "Service
   Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry" available at:
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-
   names-port-numbers.xhtml.

Internet-Draft            DOTS signal Call Home             October 2018


   The assignment of port number 4647 is strongly suggested (DOTS signal
   channel uses port number 4646).

4.2.  DOTS Signal Channel CBOR Mappings Registry

   This specification registers the 'source-prefix' and 'source-port-
   range' parameters in the IANA "DOTS Signal Channel CBOR Mappings"
   registry established by [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel].

   The source-prefix and source-port-range are comprehension-optional
   parameters.

4.3.  DOTS Signal Channel YANG Module

   This document requests IANA to register the following URIs in the
   "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

            URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-dots-signal-call-home
            Registrant Contact: The IESG.
            XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.


   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG modules in
   the "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC7950].

5.  Security Considerations

   This document deviates from standard DOTS signal channel usage by
   having the DOTS server initiate the TCP/TLS or DTLS connection.  DOTS
   signal channel related security considerations discussed in
   Section 10 of [I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel] MUST be considered.
   DOTS agents MUST authenticate each other using (D)TLS before a DOTS
   signal channel session is considered valid.

   An attacker may launch a DoS attack on the DOTS client by having it
   perform computationally expensive operations, before deducing that
   the attacker doesn't possess a valid key.  For instance, in TLS 1.3
   [RFC8446], the ServerHello message contains a Key Share value based
   on an expensive asymmetric key operation for key establishment.
   Common precautions mitigating DoS attacks are recommended, such as
   temporarily blacklisting the source address after a set number of
   unsuccessful authentication attempts.
