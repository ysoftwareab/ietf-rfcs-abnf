Internet-Draft                Feed License                    April 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document defines how Atom feed publishers can associate
   copyright licenses with the informational content of an entry.
   Licenses associated using these mechanisms MAY or MAY not be machine
   readable and are intended to communicate the various rights and
   obligations others may have with regards to the associated Atom Feed
   or Entry.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].


3.  The 'license' link relation

   An Atom link element with a 'rel' attribute value of 'license' is
   used to associate a copyright license with an Atom Feed or Entry.

   Atom entry, feed and source elements MAY each contain any number of
   license links but MUST NOT contain more than one with the same href
   value.  The IRI specified by the link's 'href' attribute SHOULD be
   dereferenceable to return a machine or human-readable representation
   of the license.

   Implementors should note that, unlike the Atom rights element, which
   specifies a human-readable statement of the rights held over a entry
   or feed, license links apply only to the informational content of the
   containing element.  That is, the presence of a license link relation
   within an Atom feed element does not extend a license over the
   various contained entry elements.  Likewise, the presence of a
   license link within an Atom source element does not extend a license
   over the informational content of the containing entry.

Internet-Draft                Feed License                    April 2006


   For example

     <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
       <id>http://www.example.com/myfeed</id>
       <title>My Example Feed</title>
       <updated>2005-07-28T12:00:00Z</updated>
       <link href="http://www.example.com/myfeed" />
       <link rel="license"
             type="text/html"
             href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/" />
       <author><name>James</name></author>
       <entry>
         <id>tag:entries.com,2005:1</td>
         <title>My original entry</title>
         <link href="http://www.example.com/entries/1" />
         <summary>This is my original entry</summary>
         <link rel="license"
               type="text/html"
               href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/" />
       </entry>
     </feed>

   Multiple license links appearing within an element is an indication
   that the informational content has been published under multiple
   copyright licenses.  In such instances, each of the linked licenses
   is considered a mutually exclusive alternative to the others.  That
   is to say, for example, if an entry contains license links to both a
   Creative Commons License and the General Public License (GPL), the
   informational content is considered to be licensed either as
   "Creative Commons OR GPL" as opposed to "Creative Commons AND GPL".
   If multiple license link relations are specified, each SHOULD contain
   a title attribute that specifies a human readable label for each
   license link.


4.  Security Considerations

   As an extension of the Atom Syndication Format, the license link
   relation is subject to the same security considerations described in
   section 8 of [RFC4287].


5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines one new Atom link relation type to be
   registered in the IANA Registry of Link Relations as defined by
   [RFC4287].
