Abstract

  This draft describes protocol of Terminal Mode which was proposed 
in ITU-T SG16 meeting on November 2000 at Geneva.  The Terminal 
Mode supports the transfer of image data, capabilities exchange and 
confirmation for Store and Forward internet fax terminals having 
limited memory and small CPU power.  Terminal Mode also supports all 
features of Group 3 facsimile on the Internet using T.30 signals in 
capability exchange.

  NOTE: This is an early, preliminary version of specification,
  indicating a possible way to achieve the protocol for Terminal Mode 
  Internet fax.  The content is rough, and
  the intent at this time is to indicate the outline of a mechanism.
  Please address comments to major structural and semantic issues.

INTERNET-DRAFT        protocol for Terminal Mode            23 June 2001
<draft-faxwg-terminal-mode-protocol-00.txt>



1 Requirement
Goals of Terminal Mode are described in draft-faxwg-terminal-
mode-goals-00.txt.  The protocol is proposed to solve the following 
problems which current IFAX can not realize.  Also simple capabilities 
format are proposed.
1)Real time confirmation of delivery
2)Capability exchange before data communication
3)Simple capabilities format

2 Proposal
Add end-to-end ESMTP communication between terminals as extension to FFPIM
or EIFAX.

2.1 Transport
ESMTP will be extended to support end-to-end connection between the
transmitter and the reciever.

2.2 Confirmation

2.2.1 Delivery confirmation
Real Time confirmation is realized by communicating with end-to-end
ESMTP between IFAX terminals.

2.2.2 Processing Confirmation
MDN response is submitted within one session or
by separate session after communication.

2.3 Capability Exchange

2.3.1 Protocol
There are several methods to be selected and discussed.
ü@ü@ü@- Define new command of EIFAX such as REQCAP
ü@ü@ü@- Define local command of EIFAX such as XREQCAP
ü@ü@ü@- Use ETRN command
          The detail is to be studied.

2.3.2 Format
Extension of RFC2531 which supports T.30 signals will be used for
exchange capabiities.



2.4 Interworking with EIFAX or Simple Mode IFAX machine
Terminal mode IFAX communicate with EIFAX or Simple Mode IFAX
machine in direct SMTP connection except capability exchange
because EIFAX or Simple Mode IFAX can speak SMTP. If network
environment doesn't allow to direct ESMTP communication,
terminal mode machine fall down its capability to FFPIM,
EIFAX or Simple Mode as store and forward mode.

3 Goals
-Easy to Implement
-Interworking with IFAX simple mode and EIFAX
-Timely delivery
-Real time delivery confirmation
-Capability exchange
-Use of existing infrastructure
