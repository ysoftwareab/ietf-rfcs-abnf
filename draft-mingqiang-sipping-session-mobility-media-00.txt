   Session mobility allows a user to transfer an ongoing communication 
   session from one device to another device. Seamless session mobility 
   is  very  important  for  real  time  multimedia  applications.  This 
   document defines a new option tag in SIP to indicate media handling 
   feature during the transfer of communication session from one device 
   to another device to achieve seamless session transfer without 
   disruption of media streams.

   The new media handling option tag is to be used in the Require SIP 
   header.  This document also defines a new media feature tag, which

1.   Introduction 
    
    
   Session mobility allows a user to transfer an ongoing communication 
   session from one device to another device.  The general approach to 
   achieve session mobility in SIP [1] including discovery process to 
   locate  transfer  target  devices,  and  signaling  needed  for  the 
   transfer  of  session  has  been  described  in  [2].  One  of  the 
   requirements for session mobility is: 
    
    
    
     o REQ: Session transfer should be as seamless as possible. It 
        should involve minimum disruption of media flow and should not 
        appear to the remote participant as a new call [2]. 
    
    
   This document addresses this particular requirement. One of the most 
   critical issues of session mobility is to avoid disruption of media 
   distribution  while  tearing  down  an  existing  media  stream  and 
   establishing a new stream.  
    
    
   Session transfer from one device to another needs to deal with two 
   types of delays both of which need to be dealt with to have seamless 
   mobility from one device to another device. The first source of 
   potential  session  discontinuity  is  the  time  to  complete  the 
   necessary   control   signaling   for   session   transfer   between 
   communicating devices including discovering and selecting a target 
   device for session transfer. The second source of discontinuity is 
   the media stream interruption caused by the session transfer from an 
   original receiving device to the new one. The discontinuity in media 
   stream is typically referred as playing "lapse", and is explained in 
   the next paragraph.

   Starting a streaming application at the receiver usually takes some 
   time which MAY involve reading system parameters and initializing 
   local buffer. Streaming clients typically have a receiver buffer 
   that is capable of storing a relatively large amount of data [8].  
   Initially, when a streaming session is established, a client does 
   not start playing the stream back immediately.  Rather, it typically 
   buffers the incoming data in a play back buffer for a short 
   duration. This duration could range from a few milliseconds to a few 
   seconds depending upon the property of the decoder at the receiver.  
   This buffering at the receiver helps maintain continuous playback. 
   In the event of occasional increased transmission delays or network 
   throughput drops, the client can decode and play buffered data.  
   Otherwise, without initial buffering, the client has to freeze the 
   display, stop decoding, and wait for incoming data.   
    
    
   Therefore, in order for a session transfer to be seamless, we need 
   to parallelize the process of selecting the transfer target device 
   and creating the necessary playback buffer at the target device to 
   eliminate pre-roll delay.  We define pre-roll delay as the time that 
   it takes for the receiver buffer to fill to a desired level so that 
   playback can begin instantly. The SIP REFER based session transfer 
   mechanism as specified in [2] clearly is inadequate to deal with the 
   lapse caused by the disruption of media stream at the new receiver. 
   This document proposes a new mechanism, which prepares the target 
   receiver in advance of session transfer to receive the media stream 
   so that the session switching is done with minimal delay. This 
   mechanism also ensures that buffering delay is no longer an issue, 
   and the user can enjoy the continuous media stream without any loss 
   of contents.  
    
   This document defines a new option tag in SIP namely "bufferonly" to 
   indicate how to handle media such as whether to display or buffer 
   the media during the transfer of session. We also define a new media 
   feature tag, namely "mediahandling", that can also be used in the 
   Contact header field to indicate to the SIP UA how to handle the 
   media. The use of Contact header to indicate capability or features 
   has already been discussed in RFC 3840 [3]. When the Contact header 
   field contains the "mediahandling" tag, it should be treated as an 
   indication to the SIP UA that the value of the tag will indicate 
   whether the media should be displayed or buffered. The mechanisms of 
   how to use the new option tag and the new media feature tag to 
   accomplish seamless session mobility are described in the following 
   sections.

2.   Terminology and Conventions 
    
    
   Device: A software or hardware appliance, which is represented by a 
   SIP UA. 
    
   PAN (Personal Area Network): PAN is a collection of one or more 
   logically associated devices that share the same physical 
   communication medium within a close proximity of each other (e.g., 
   network formed by devices that can be accessed by near field radio 
   like Bluetooth). 
    
   Session [4]: A set of media senders and receivers and the data 
   streams flowing from senders to receivers. 
     
   Session Mobility: The mechanism that allows a user to transfer an 
   ongoing communication session from one device to another device. 
     
   Seamless Session Mobility: The mechanism of transferring an ongoing 
   communication session with minimal delay from one device to another 
   device without any perceivable disruption of media streams from a 
   user's perspective. 
    
   Target Device: A device to which a user wishes to switch an existing 
   session. 
    
    
    
   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT 
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as 
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [5] and indicate requirement levels 
   for compliant implementations. 
    
    
    
3.   Scope 
     
   The new SIP option tag and new media feature tag are only defined to 
   indicate to a SIP UA how the media of a communication session should 
   be handled during the process of session transfer. These two SIP 
   extensions are intended to transfer an ongoing communication session 
   from one device to another device without disruption of media flow 
   and they can be also used in other applications where indications of 
   such media handling features are necessary.

4.   Application Scenario 
    
    
   Figure 1 shows a typical application scenario of session mobility, 
   which is achieved using SIP REFER [6] method. There are three 
   components in this application participating in session mobility: 
   The Correspondent Node (CN), Mobile Node (A) and a Target Device 
   (B). The Correspondent Node (CN) is a basic multimedia content 
   endpoint and the Mobile Node (A) is a basic SIP user agent capable 
   of  receiving  content  from  the  Correspondent  Node  (CN)  by 
   establishing a SIP session. The Mobile Node (A) chooses the Target 
   Device (B) to transfer session from A to B. The Mobile Node (A) 
   discovers the Target Device (B) using a suitable service/device 
   discovery mechanism after A forms a Personal Area Network with 
   devices around it. The Target Device (B) is also a typical SIP user 
   agent capable of handling REFER mechanism.   
    
   In this application scenario the Mobile Node (A) has established a 
   video call with the Correspondent Node (CN). A moves to a new 
   location and forms a PAN with devices around it. A then discovers 
   the device B that has higher display resolution. A decides to 
   continue the session on A with CN, but would like to watch the video 
   on B instead of A. In the typical case, A would send a REFER message 
   to B asking B to establish a session with CN. B will send an INVITE 
   message to CN to establish a session with CN so that B can receive 
   media stream directly from CN. Once the session is established 
   between CN and B, B will start receiving the media stream and the 
   user can view the video on device B.

                               | 
                   +-----------------------+  
                   |          Network      |

                  Figure 1:  Session mobility using REFER 
    
    
   Even though the REFER method can be used to receive media from CN to 
   B, the launch of the application in B usually takes some time after 
   the REFER is accepted. There is also an unexpected delay to 
   establish a session between CN and B. Moreover, there is also delay 
   to buffer media in B, therefore, it may take several seconds before 
   the user can actually view the video on B by just using the REFER 
   method.

   To solve the problem of application setup delay and ensure non-
   disruptive transfer of a session several additional steps are needed 
   in addition to using the SIP REFER method. To initiate a seamless 
   session transfer, the Mobile Node (A) first forms a PAN (Personal 
   Area Network) with the devices around it. After device discovery 
   process is completed, A starts sending media streams using multicast 
   to all the devices in the PAN which could be a potential target for 
   the session transfer. For example, a mobile device may discover 
   multiple devices with large screen display in its PAN. The user 
   input or some other criteria may be used to select the actual 
   session transfer target device. By establishing media sessions in 
   advance of actual target selection, each device is ready to receive 
   the session by building necessary buffer. 
    
   Before A selects a Target Device media stream sent by A should not 
   be displayed on the potential target devices around A. The devices 
   in the PAN needs an indication that the received media are only to 
   be used for buffering purposes and should not be displayed on the 
   device. We propose a new option tag in SIP to accomplish this goal. 
   We also propose a new media handling feature tag that could also be 
   used instead of the new option tag to indicate media handling 
   feature. The new option tag and the media feature tag are defined in 
   the IANA considerations section. Once A selects the Target Device B 
   by sending another INVITE message, only then can B start displaying 
   the media stream. Once B starts displaying the media, REFER will be 
   sent to B by A, and B can start receiving media directly from CN by 
   establishing a session with CN.

5.1. Example of new Option-Tag 
    
   According to Figure 2, A is receiving media streams from CN. F1 is 
   sent by A to all possible target devices around it (including B) to 
   establish sessions with devices in PAN. The F1 INVITE message 
   includes "bufferonly" option-tag and it is carried in the Require 
   header field. The devices receiving this INVITE request interpret 
   this INVITE message as a "bufferonly" media session and hence do not 
   display the media streams. 
    
   As a result of this INVITE, the media application at the receiver is 
   started, the media playback buffer is initialized and the stream is 
   buffered in the local buffer. These steps MAY take some time at the 
   receiver. Since the receiver at B is not required to play the stream 
   at this point, the delay in these steps is hidden from the user.

5.2. Example of New Media Feature Tag 
    
   According to Figure 2, A is receiving media streams from CN. F1 is 
   sent by A to all the possible target devices around it (including B) 
   to establish media sessions with devices in PAN. The Contact header 
   field    of    F1,    includes    the    media    feature    tag, 
   mediahandling="bufferonly".  The  devices  receiving  this  INVITE 
   request interpret this INVITE message as a "bufferonly" session and 
   hence do not display the media streams.

   Once A selects B as the target device for session transfer, A sends 
   F2 INVITE (re-Invite) message to B to update the session between A 
   and B. The F2 message does not include mediahandling feature tag in 
   the Contact header and hence media streams for this session are 
   displayed on B.

6.   IANA Considerations 
    
    
   There are two IANA considerations associated with this document.  
    
    
6.1. SIP Option Tag Registration 
    
   This document requires registration of a new option tag, 
   "bufferonly". The required information for this registration, as 
   specified in RFC 3261 [1], is: 
    
        Name: bufferonly 
         
        Description: This option tag is used for indicating media 
        handling feature while transferring a session seamlessly from 
        one device to another device. While present in a Require 
        header, it indicates the UA should only buffer the multimedia 
        content rather than displaying it. 
    
    
6.2. Media Feature Tag Registration 
    
    
   This document requires registration of a new feature tag according 
   to the procedures of RFC 2506 [7]. This registration will be made in 
   the SIP tree for media feature tags. This registration is as 
   follows: 
    
    
   Media feature tag name:  sip.mediahandling 
   ASN.1 Identifier: New assignment by IANA.  
   Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag: The 
   sip.mediahandling feature tag indicates a SIP UA on how to handle 
   the media sent by another SIP UA.   
   Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: Token with an 
   equality relationship.  
   Typical values include: String value, "bufferonly". The media is to 
   be used only for buffering.

7.   Security Considerations 
    
   There are some security concerns that must be addressed while a 
   Mobile Node intends to establish communication sessions with devices 
   in PAN. The Mobile Node needs to authenticate itself with the 
   devices in PAN in order to limit the accessibility of devices in PAN 
   by unauthorized users. Some of the security concerns are already 
   addressed in [2] and additional security concerns will be addressed 
   in the future revision.
