1.  Introduction

   [I-D.hu-mpls-sr-inter-domain-use-cases] provides stitching path label
   to indicate the the packet from the border nodes to forward to
   another AS domain.  The border nodes should install the following
   MPLS data entries:

     incomging label: Stiching Path Label
        outgoing label: the SID list of the next AS domain + next Stitching Path label

   [I-D.xiong-pce-stateful-pce-sr-inter-domain] introduces the procedure
   and the PCEP extension to form the inter-domain MPLS-TP MPLS data
   entries.  This document proposes the related LSP association group
   extension.

3.  Operation Overview

   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] introduces a generic mechanism to
   create a grouping of LSPs.  This grouping can then be used to define
   associations between sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs and a set
   of attributes.  This document proposes a new optional association
   object type called "stitching Association LSP type" and the related
   TLV called "stitching association LSP TLV" to form the inter-domain
   MPLS forwarding entry for the border nodes.

   As defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group], stitching LSP
   Association could be created dynamically or configured by the
   operator when operator-configured association is needed.

4.  Stitching LSP Association Group

4.1.  Stitching LSP Association Object

   A new Association Type for the Association Object is defined in this
   document,

      Association Type (TBD) = Stitching Path Segment LSP Association
      Group.

   The Association Types is operator-configured associations in nature
   and statically created by the operator on the PCEP peers.  The LSP
   belonging to these associations is conveyed via PCEP messages to the
   PCEP peer.  Operator-configured Association Range TLV
   [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] MUST NOT be sent for this
   Association Type, and MUST be ignored, so that the entire range of
   association ID can be used for it.

   The Association ID, Association Source, optional Global Association
   Source and optional Extended Association ID in the Stitching Path
   Segment LSP Association Group Object are initialized using the
   procedures defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-association-group] and [RFC7551].

4.2.  Stitching TLV format

   The format of the Stitching LSP Association Group TLV is shown in
   Figure 1.

               Figure 1: Stitching LSP Association Group TLV

   The fields of the Stitching LSP Association Group TLV are following:

      Type:16bits, it indicates the stitching LSP Association Group
      TLV(TBD2, the value is assigned by IANA).

      Length: the value is 4, it indicates the length of the TLV is 4
      bytes.

      Reserved: it is reserved for future use.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Association Types

   IANA is requested to make the assignment of values for the sub-
   registry "ASSOCIATION Type Field" as follows:

                       +--------+------------------+
                       | Value  |    Reference     |

                       |  TBD1  | [this document]  |
                       +--------+------------------+

7.2.  Stitching Association TLV

   This document defines a new TLV for carrying additional information
   of LSPs within a Stitching LSP Association Group.  IANA is requested
   to add the assignment of a new value in the existing "PCEP TLV Type
   Indicators" registry as follows:
