               Using the Flow Label with Dual-Stack Lite
               draft-donley-softwire-dslite-flowlabel-00

Abstract

   This document extends the use of Dual-Stack Lite to identify discrete
   traffic flows using the IPv6 Flow Label.  The identification of
   discrete traffic flows allows for the application of Quality of
   Service (QoS) classification and prioritization of traffic traversing
   Dual-Stack Lite tunnels.

1.  Introduction

   Dual-Stack Lite [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite] describes a
   method for transitioning to IPv6 by encapsulating IPv4 traffic within
   an IPv6 tunnel and translating it at the Address Family Translation
   Router.  Through such encapsulation, DS-Lite obfuscates the IPv4
   5-tuple behind the IPv6 header, thereby making it difficult to
   classify IPv4 traffic.  Thus, to QoS classifiers, all IPv4 traffic is
   encapsulated as IP-in-IP and uses the same IPv6 source address,
   destination address, and protocol.  There is no differentiation of
   IPv4 traffic requiring differentiated quality of service such as
   Voice over IP.

   This lack of differentiation can be problematic for traffic types
   where prioritization is desired.  For example, it is common practice
   to provide QoS for voice traffic.  Such classification and
   prioritization is typically performed by network elements located
   between the Basic BroadBand Bridging element and Address Family
   Transition Router, particularly on WAN links.  However, in a Dual-
   Stack Lite environment, many such network elements are unable to
   identify characteristics of a particular IPv4 traffic flow and apply
   QoS accordingly.

   This document proposes a method of providing QoS to IPv4 traffic in a
   DS-Lite environment by identifying individual traffic flows using the
   IPv6 Flow Label.

3.  Allowing Dual-Stack Lite QoS Using the IPv6 Flow Label

   As described in [RFC3697], a flow is a sequence of packets sent from
   a particular source to a particular unicast, anycast, or multicast
   destination that the sender desires to label as a flow.  IPv6 uses
   the Flow Label in the IPv6 header to identify such flows.  In cases
   where the Flow Label field uniquely identifies such traffic flows,
   packet classifiers can utilize the triplet of Flow Label, Source
   Address, and Destination Address fields in order to identify packets
   belonging to a particular flow.

   As described in [I-D.ietf-softwire-dual-stack-lite], traffic is
   encapsulated between the Basic BroadBand Bridging (B4) element and
   Address Family Transition Router (AFTR).  Both the B4 and AFTR are
   aware of the 5-tuple of the encapsulated IPv4 traffic.  Thus, both
   the B4 and AFTR are capable of identifying IPv4 traffic flows and
   setting the IPv6 Flow Label for the DS-Lite tunnel accordingly.  By
   populating the Flow Label field in DS-Lite tunnels, service providers
   can use Flow Label classifiers to provide priority treatment to
   appropriate traffic flows.

3.1.  B4 Considerations

   The B4 SHOULD uniquely set the IPv6 Flow Label to a non-zero value
   per IPv4 traffic flow in accordance with [RFC3697].  That is, the B4
   SHOULD identify IPv4 traffic flows by the IPv4 5-tuple of IPv4 Source
   Address, Destination Address, Protocol, Source Port, and Destination
   Port.  The B4 SHOULD construct a unique Flow Label based on the IPv4
   5-tuple and apply it to the IPv6 header attached to that flow as it
   is encapsulated within a DS-Lite tunnel.  If the B4 sets the IPv6
   Flow Label to a non-zero value, it MUST use the same Flow Label value
   for other IPv4 packets belonging to the same flow (as determined by
   the IPv4 5-tuple).

3.2.  AFTR Considerations

   The AFTR SHOULD uniquely set the IPv6 Flow Label per IPv4 traffic
   flow in accordance with [RFC3697].  That is, the AFTR SHOULD identify
   IPv4 traffic flows to be sent to the B4 by the IPv4 5-tuple of IPv4
   Source Address, Destination Address, Protocol, Source Port, and
   Destination Port after completing Network Address Translation.  The
   AFTR SHOULD construct a unique Flow Label based on the IPv4 5-tuple
   and apply it to the IPv6 header attached to that flow as it is
   encapsulated within a DS-Lite tunnel.  If the AFTR sets the IPv6 Flow
   Label to a non-zero value, it MUST use the same Flow Label value for
   other IPv4 packets belonging to the same flow (as determined by the
   IPv4 5-tuple).

3.3.  Constructing the Flow Label

   The exact mechanism for constructing the Flow Label is not specified,
   except as per [RFC3697].  Implementations could use a 20-bit hash of
   the IPv4 5-tuple such that subsequent IPv4 packets with the same
   5-tuple will receive the same Flow Label.

   As specified by [RFC3697], Flow Label information is only significant
   to the B4 or AFTR transmitting the particular DS-Lite flow.  Since
   the Flow Label will be consistently applied to all packets in the
   flow, however, intermediate devices between the B4 and AFTR can use
   the Flow Label in packet classifiers to provide quality of service
   treatment to the flow.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are described in [RFC3697], section 5.  The
   Flow Label is not protected, and could be modified by an on-path
   attacker.  However, the impact of any such modification would be
   limited to the QoS treatment of the modified packet(s).
