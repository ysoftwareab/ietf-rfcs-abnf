INTERNET DRAFT     E-TREE Support in EVPN & PBB-EVPN        July 6, 2015


1  Introduction

   The Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) has defined a rooted-multipoint
   Ethernet service known as Ethernet Tree (E-Tree). In an E-Tree
   service, endpoints are labeled as either Root or Leaf sites. Root
   sites can communicate with all other sites. Leaf sites can
   communicate with Root sites but not with other Leaf sites. 

   [ETREE-FMWK] proposes the solution framework for supporting E-Tree
   service in MPLS networks. The document identifies the functional
   components of the overall solution to emulate E-Tree services in
   addition to Ethernet LAN (E-LAN) services on an existing MPLS
   network.

   [EVPN] is a solution for multipoint L2VPN services, with advanced
   multi-homing capabilities, using BGP for distributing customer/client
   MAC address reach-ability information over the MPLS/IP network. [PBB-
   EVPN] combines the functionality of EVPN with [802.1ah] Provider
   Backbone Bridging for MAC address scalability.

   This document discusses how the functional requirements for E-Tree
   service can be easily met with (PBB-)EVPN and how (PBB-)EVPN offers a
   more efficient implementation of these functions. 

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].


2  E-Tree Scenarios and EVPN / PBB-EVPN Support

   In this section, we will categorize support for E-Tree into three
   different scenarios, depending on the nature of the site association
   (Root/Leaf) per PE or per Ethernet Segment:

   - Leaf OR Root site(s) per PE

   - Leaf AND Root site(s) per PE

   - Leaf AND Root site(s) per Ethernet Segment


2.1 Scenario 1: Leaf OR Root site(s) per PE

   In this scenario, a PE may receive traffic from either Root sites OR
   Leaf sites for a given MAC-VRF/bridge table, but not both

   concurrently. In other words, a given MAC-VRF/bridge table on a PE is
   either associated with a root or leaf. The PE may have both Root and
   Leaf sites albeit for different MAC-VRFs/bridge tables.  

                   +---------+            +---------+
                   |   PE1   |            |   PE2   |
    +---+          |  +---+  |  +------+  |  +---+  |            +---+
    |CE1+---ES1----+--+   |  |  | MPLS |  |  |   +--+----ES2-----+CE2|

                   |  |VRF|  |  |      |  |  |VRF|  |
                   |  |   |  |  |      |  |  |   |  |            +---+
                   |  |   |  |  |      |  |  |   +--+----ES3-----+CE3|
                   |  +---+  |  +------+  |  +---+  |   (Leaf)   +---+
                   +---------+            +---------+

   Figure 1: Scenario 1

   In such scenario, an EVPN PE implementation MAY provide topology
   constraint among the PEs belonging to the same EVI associated with an
   E-TREE service. The purpose of this topology constraint is to avoid
   having PEs with only  Leaf sites importing and processing BGP MAC
   routes from each other, thereby unnecessarily exhausting their RIB
   tables. To support such topology constrain in EVPN, two BGP Route-
   Targets (RTs) are used for every EVPN Instance (EVI): one RT is
   associated with the Root sites and the other is associated with the
   Leaf sites. On a per EVI basis, every PE exports the single RT
   associated with its type of site(s). Furthermore, a PE with Root
   site(s) imports both Root and Leaf RTs, whereas a PE with Leaf
   site(s) only imports the Root RT. If the number of EVIs is very large
   (e.g., more than 32K or 64K), then RT type 0 as defined in [RFC4360]
   SHOULD be used; otherwise, RT type 2 is sufficient.

2.2 Scenario 2: Leaf OR Root site(s) per AC

   In this scenario, a PE may receive traffic from either Root OR Leaf
   sites on a given Attachment Circuit (AC) of a MAC-VRF/bridge table.
   In other words, an AC (ES or ES/VLAN) is either associated with a
   Root or Leaf (but not both).

                     +---------+            +---------+

   Figure 2: Scenario 2

   In this scenario, if there are PEs with only root (or leaf) sites per
   EVI, then the RT constrain procedures described in section 2.1 can
   also be used here. However, when a Root site is added to a Leaf PE
   (or vise versa), then that PE needs to process MAC routes from all
   other Leaf PEs and add them to its forwarding table. If for a given
   EVI, the PEs can eventually have both Leaf and Root sites attached,
   even though they may start as Root-only or Leaf-only PEs, then it is
   recommended to use a single RT per EVI and avoid additional
   configuration and operational overhead.


2.3 Scenario 3: Leaf OR Root site(s) per MAC

   In this scenario, a PE may receive traffic from both Root AND Leaf
   sites on a given Attachment Circuit (AC) of a MAC-VRF/bridge table.
   Since an Attachment Circuit (ES or ES/VLAN) carries traffic from both
   Root and Leaf sites, the granularity at which Root or Leaf sites are
   identifies is on a per MAC address. This scenario is considered in
   this draft for EVPN service with only known unicast traffic - i.e.,
   there is no BUM traffic.

INTERNET DRAFT     E-TREE Support in EVPN & PBB-EVPN        July 6, 2015


3 Operation for EVPN

   [EVPN] defines the notion of ESI MPLS label used for split-horizon
   filtering of BUM traffic at the egress PE. Such egress filtering
   capabilities can be leveraged in provision of E-TREE services as seen
   shortly. In other words, [EVPN] has inherent capability to support E-
   TREE services without defining any new BGP routes but just defining a
   new BGP Extended Community for leaf indication as shown later in this
   document.


3.1 Known Unicast Traffic

   Since in EVPN, MAC learning is performed in control plane via
   advertisement of BGP routes, the filtering needed by E-TREE service
   for known unicast traffic can be performed at the ingress PE, thus
   providing very efficient filtering and avoiding sending known unicast
   traffic over MPLS/IP core to be filtered at the egress PE as done in
   traditional E-TREE solutions (e.g., E-TREE for VPLS). 

   To provide such ingress filtering for known unicast traffic, a PE
   MUST indicate to other PEs what kind of sites (root or leaf) its MAC
   addresses are associated with. This indication is achieved by using
   one of the following mechanisms: 

   1) For single-homing scenarios of sections 2.2 and 2.3, the PE
   advertises the MAC addresses received from a Leaf site, with an
   Extended community indicating a leaf flag. The lack of such flag
   indicates that the MAC address is associated with a root site.

   2) For multi-homing scenario of section 2.2, where an AC is either
   root or leaf (but not both), the PE advertises leaf indication along
   with the Ethernet A-D per EVI route. Since these routes are always
   advertised ahead of MAC advertisements route, there is no need to
   append leaf-indication flag with the MAC advertisement routes. The
   leaf indication flag on Ethernet A-D per EVI route tells the
   receiving PEs that all MAC addresses associated with this <ESI, EVI>
   or <ESI, EVI/VLAN> are from a leaf site. The lack of such leaf-
   indication flag tells the receiving PEs that the MAC addresses are
   associated with a root site.

   If a leaf site is multi-homed to PE1 an PE2, and PE1 advertises the
   Ethernet A-D per EVI corresponding to this leaf site with the leaf-
   indication flag but PE2 does not, then the receiving PE MUST notify
   the operator of such discrepancy and ignore the leaf-indication flag
   on PE1. In other words, in case of discrepancy, the multi-homing for
   that pair of PEs is assumed to be in default "root" mode for that
   <ESI, EVI> or <ESI, EVI/VLAN>.

INTERNET DRAFT     E-TREE Support in EVPN & PBB-EVPN        July 6, 2015


   3) For multi-homing scenario of section 2.3, where an AC is both root
   or leaf (i.e., root or leaf indication is at the granularity of MAC
   address), the PE advertises leaf indication along with each MAC
   advertisement route just as in (1). No leaf-indication flag SHALL be
   sent along with the Ethernet A-D per EVI route for this scenario.   

   Tagging MAC addresses with a leaf indication (either directly via MAC
   advertisement route or indirectly via Ethernet A-D per EVI route)
   enables remote PEs to perform ingress filtering for known unicast
   traffic - i.e., on the ingress PE, the MAC destination address lookup
   yields, in addition to the forwarding adjacency, a flag which
   indicates whether the target MAC is associated with a Leaf site or
   not. The ingress PE cross-checks this flag with the status of the
   originating AC, and if both are Leafs, then the packet is not
   forwarded.

   To support the above ingress filtering functionality, a new E-TREE
   Extended Community with a Leaf indication flag is introduced [section
   5.2]. This new Extended Community is advertised with either Ethernet
   A-D per EVI route or MAC/IP Advertisement route as described above. 

3.2 BUM Traffic

   For BUM traffic, it is not possible to perform filtering on the
   ingress PE, as is the case with known unicast, because of the multi-
   destination nature of the traffic. As such, the solution relies on
   egress filtering. In order to apply the proper egress filtering,
   which varies based on whether a packet is sent from a Leaf AC or a
   root AC, the MPLS-encapsulated frames MUST be tagged with an
   indication of whether they originated from a Leaf AC or not. In other
   words, leaf/root indication for BUM traffic is done at the
   granularity of AC. This can be achieved in EVPN through the use of
   the ESI MPLS label. Therefore, the ESI MPLS label can be used to
   either identify the Ethernet segment of origin per [RFC 7432] or it
   can be used to indicate that the packet is originated from a leaf
   site.

   BUM traffic sent over a P2MP LSP or ingress replication, may need to
   carry an upstream assigned or downstream assigned MPLS label
   (respectively) for the purpose of egress filtering to indicate to the
   egress PEs whether this packet is originated from a root AC or a leaf
   AC.

   The main difference between downstream and upstream assigned ESI MPLS
   label is that in case of downstream assigned not all egress PE
   devices need to receive the ESI label just like ingress replication
   procedures defined in [RFC7432].

INTERNET DRAFT     E-TREE Support in EVPN & PBB-EVPN        July 6, 2015


   There are four scenarios to consider:

3.2.1 BUM traffic originated from a single-homed site on a leaf AC

   In this scenario, the ingress PE adds a special ESI MPLS label to the
   frame indicating a Leaf site. This special ESI MPLS label used for
   single-homing scenarios is not on a per ES basis but rather on a per
   PE basis - i.e., a single ESI MPLS label is used for all single-homed
   ES's on that PE. This special ESI MPLS label is advertised to other
   PE devices, using a new EVPN Extended Community called Leaf ESI MPLS
   label Extended Community (section 5.1) along with a set of Ethernet
   A-D per ES routes. The set of Ethernet A-D per ES routes may be
   needed if the number of Route Targets (RTs) that need to be sent
   exceed the limit on a single route per [RFC 7432]. The RT(s)
   represent EVIs with at least a leaf site in them.  The ESI for the
   Ethernet A-D per ES route is set to zero indicating single-homed
   sites.

   When a PE receives this special ESI MPLS label in the data path, it
   blocks the packet if the destination AC is of type Leaf; otherwise,
   it forwards the packet.  

3.2.2 BUM traffic originated from a single-homed site on a root AC

   In this scenario, the ingress PE does not add any ESI MPLS label and
   it operates per [RFC7432] procedures. 

3.2.3 BUM traffic originated from a multi-homed site on a leaf AC

   In this scenario, the ingress PE adds an ESI MPLS label to the frame
   indicating both the Ethernet Segment of origin and its Leaf type. The
   reason Ethernet Segment of origin needs to be identified in addition
   to Leaf type, is to accommodate multi-homing scenarios for Integrated
   Routing and Bridging (IRB) where a source (Leaf) can be on one VLAN
   and the receivers (roots) can be on some other VLANs for the same
   Ethernet Segment. 

   This ESI MPLS label is advertised to other PE devices, using a new
   EVPN Extended Community called Leaf ESI Label Extended Community
   (section 5.1) along with a set of Ethernet A-D per ES routes
   corresponding to the ES of the origin. If the egress ES is the same
   as the originated ES, then the receiving PE uses the same procedure
   for filtering BUM traffic as the one specified in [RFC 7432]. If the
   egress ES is different from the originated ES, then the receiving PE
   uses the ESI label to identify that the BUM traffic is associated
   with a leaf site and thus blocking the BUM traffic if the destination
   AC is also of type Leaf similar to section 3.2.1.

3.2.4 BUM traffic originated from a multi-homed site on a root AC

   In this scenario, both the ingress and egress PE devices follows the
   procedure defined in [RFC 7432] for adding and/or processing an ESI
   MPLS label.


   The ingress PE imposes the right ESI MPLS label depending on whether
   the Ethernet frame originated from the Root or Leaf site on that
   Ethernet Segment. The mechanism by which the PE identifies whether a
   given frame originated from a Root or Leaf site on the segment is
   based on the Ethernet Tag associated with the frame (e.g., whether
   the frame come from a leaf or a root AC). Other mechanisms for
   identifying whether an egress AC is a root or leaf is beyond the
   scope of this document.



3.3 E-TREE Traffic Flows for EVPN

   Per [ETREE-FMWK], a generic E-Tree service supports all of the
   following traffic flows:

        - Ethernet Unicast from Root to Roots & Leaf
        - Ethernet Unicast from Leaf to Root
        - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast from Root to Roots & Leafs
        - Ethernet Broadcast/Multicast from Leaf to Roots

   A particular E-Tree service may need to support all of the above
   types of flows or only a select subset, depending on the target
   application. In the case where unicast flows need not be supported,
   the L2VPN PEs can avoid performing any MAC learning function. 

   In the subsections that follow, we will describe the operation of
   EVPN to support E-Tree service with and without MAC learning.


3.3.1 E-Tree with MAC Learning

   The PEs implementing an E-Tree service must perform MAC learning when
   unicast traffic flows must be supported from Root to Leaf or from
   Leaf to Root sites. In this case, the PE with Root sites performs MAC
   learning in the data-path over the Ethernet Segments, and advertises
   reachability in EVPN MAC Advertisement routes. These routes will be
   imported by PEs that have Leaf sites as well as by PEs that have Root
   sites, in a given EVI. Similarly, the PEs with Leaf sites perform MAC
   learning in the data-path over their Ethernet Segments, and advertise
   reachability in EVPN MAC Advertisement routes which are imported only

INTERNET DRAFT     E-TREE Support in EVPN & PBB-EVPN        July 6, 2015


   by PEs with at least one Root site in the EVI. A PE with only Leaf
   sites will not import these routes. PEs with Root and/or Leaf sites
   may use the Ethernet A-D routes for aliasing (in the case of multi-
   homed segments) and for mass MAC withdrawal per [RFC 7432].

   To support multicast/broadcast from Root to Leaf sites, either a P2MP
   tree rooted at the PE(s) with the Root site(s) or ingress replication
   can be used. The multicast tunnels are set up through the exchange of
   the EVPN Inclusive Multicast route, as defined in [RFC7432]. 

   To support multicast/broadcast from Leaf to Root sites, ingress
   replication should be sufficient for most scenarios where there is a
   single Root or few Roots. If the number of Roots is large, a P2MP
   tree rooted at the PEs with Leaf sites may be used.

3.3.2 E-Tree without MAC Learning

   The PEs implementing an E-Tree service need not perform MAC learning
   when the traffic flows between Root and Leaf sites are multicast or
   broadcast. In this case, the PEs do not exchange EVPN MAC
   Advertisement routes. Instead, the Ethernet A-D routes are used to
   exchange the EVPN labels. 

   The fields of the Ethernet A-D route are populated per the procedures
   defined in [RFC7432], and the route import rules are as described in
   previous sections.

4 Operation for PBB-EVPN

   In PBB-EVPN, the PE must advertise a Root/Leaf indication along with
   each B-MAC Advertisement route, to indicate whether the associated B-
   MAC address corresponds to a Root or a Leaf site. Similar to the EVPN
   case, this flag will be added to the new E-TREE Extended Community
   defined in section [5.2], and advertised with each MAC Advertisement
   route.

   In the case where a multi-homed Ethernet Segment has both Root and
   Leaf sites attached, two B-MAC addresses are allocated and
   advertised: one B-MAC address implicitly denoting Root and the other
   explicitly denoting Leaf. The former B-MAC address is not advertised
   with the E-TREE extended community but the latter B-MAC denoting Leaf
   is advertised with the new E-TREE extended community.

   The ingress PE uses the right B-MAC source address depending on
   whether the Ethernet frame originated from the Root or Leaf site on
   that Ethernet Segment. The mechanism by which the PE identifies
   whether a given frame originated from a Root or Leaf site on the
   segment is based on the Ethernet Tag associated with the frame. Other

INTERNET DRAFT     E-TREE Support in EVPN & PBB-EVPN        July 6, 2015


   mechanisms of identification, beyond the Ethernet Tag, are outside
   the scope of this document. It should be noted that support for both
   Root and Leaf sites on a single Ethernet Segment requires that the PE
   performs the Ethernet Segment split-horizon check on a per Ethernet
   Tag basis. 

   In the case where a multi-homed Ethernet Segment has only Root OR
   Leaf sites attached, then a single B-MAC address is allocated and
   advertised per segment.

   Furthermore, a PE advertises two special global B-MAC addresses: one
   for Root and another for Leaf, and tags the Leaf one as such in the
   MAC Advertisement route. These B-MAC addresses are used as source
   addresses for traffic originating from single-homed segments.

4.1 Known Unicast Traffic

   For known unicast traffic, the PEs perform ingress filtering: On the
   ingress PE, the C-MAC destination address lookup yields, in addition
   to the target B-MAC address and forwarding adjacency, a flag which
   indicates whether the target B-MAC is associated with a Root or a
   Leaf site. The ingress PE cross-checks this flag with the status of
   the originating site, and if both are a Leaf, then the packet is not
   forwarded.


4.2 BUM Traffic

   For BUM traffic, the PEs must perform egress filtering. When a PE
   receives a MAC advertisement route, it updates its Ethernet Segment
   egress filtering function (based on the B-MAC source address), as
   follows:

   - If the MAC Advertisement route indicates that the advertised B-MAC
   is a Leaf, and the local Ethernet Segment is a Leaf as well, then the
   source B-MAC address is added to the B-MAC filtering list.

   - Otherwise, the B-MAC filtering list is not updated.

   When the egress PE receives the packet, it examines the B-MAC source
   address to check whether it should filter or forward the frame. Note
   that this uses the same filtering logic as baseline [PBB-EVPN] and
   does not require any additional flags in the data-plane.

   The PE places all Leaf Ethernet Segments of a given bridge domain in
   a single split-horizon group in order to prevent intra-PE forwarding
   among Leaf segments. This split-horizon function applies to BUM
   traffic.

5 BGP Encoding

   This document defines two new BGP Extended Community for EVPN.

5.1 Leaf ESI Label Extended Community

   This Extended Community is a new transitive Extended Community having
   a Type field value of 0x06 (EVPN) and the Sub-Type 0x04. In purpose,
   it is similar to ESI Label EC defined in [RFC 7432] with the only
   difference that it is used to indicate a leaf site in addition to the
   Ethernet segment of origin.

   It may be advertised along with Ethernet Auto-discovery routes, and
   it enables split-horizon procedures for multihomed sites as described
   in Section 3.2.1.3.  The Leaf ESI Label field represents an ES with a
   leaf site by the advertising PE, and it is used in split-horizon
   filtering by other PEs that are connected to the same multihomed
   Ethernet segment and egress filtering by other PEs that are connected
   to Leaf ACs.

   The E-TREE Extended Community is encoded as an 8-octet value as
   follows:


        0                   1                   2                   3

5.2 E-TREE Extended Community

   A new EVPN BGP Extended Community called E-TREE is introduced here.
   This new extended community is a transitive extended community with
   the Type field of 0x06 (EVPN) and the Sub-Type of 0x05. This extended
   community is used to for leaf indication and it is advertised with an
   EVPN MAC/IP route or an Ethernet A-D per EVI route.  

   The E-TREE Extended Community is encoded as an 8-octet value as
   follows:
