   This document defines methodologies for benchmarking EVPN and PBB-
   EVPN performance.  EVPN is defined in RFC 7432, and is being deployed
   in Service Provider networks.  Specifically this document defines the
   methodologies for benchmarking EVPN/PBB-EVPN convergence, data plane
   performance, and control plane performance.

1.  Introduction

   EVPN is defined in RFC 7432, and describes BGP MPLS- based Ethernet
   VPNs (EVPN).  PBB-EVPN is defined in RFC 7623, discusses how Ethernet
   Provider backbone Bridging can be combined with EVPNs to provide a
   new/combined solution.  This draft defines methodologies that can be
   used to benchmark both RFC 7432 and RFC 7623 solutions.  Further,
   this draft provides methodologies for benchmarking the performance of
   EVPN data and control planes, MAC learning, MAC flushing, MAC ageing,
   convergence, high availability, and scale.
