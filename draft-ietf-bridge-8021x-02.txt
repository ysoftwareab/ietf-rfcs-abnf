Abstract

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based
   internets. In particular, it defines objects for managing the
   operation of Port Access Control, based on the specification
   contained in Clause 8 and Clause 9 of the IEEE 802.1X standard. This
   clause includes a MIB module that is SNMPv2 SMI compliant.

   This standard defines a mechanism for Port-based network access
   control that makes use of the physical access characteristics of
   IEEE 802 LAN infrastructures in order to provide a means of
   authenticating and authorizing devices attached to a LAN port that
   has point-to-point connection characteristics, and of preventing

   access to that port in cases in which the authentication and
   authorization process fails.

   This standard is part of a family of standards for local and
   metropolitan area networks. 

   This draft is written within the IEEE 802.1X working group and is
   being presented to the IETF for informational purposes.

1. Introduction

The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in

        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of

Internet Draft        Port Access Control (802.1X) MIB     July 17, 2003

        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


2. Overview

   Local Area Networks (or LANs; see 3.4 in IEEE Std 802.1D, 1998 
   Edition) are often deployed in environments that permit unauthorized
   devices to be physically attached to the LAN infrastructure, or
   permit unauthorized users to attempt to access the LAN through 
   equipment already attached. Examples of such environments include
   corporate LANs that provide LAN connectivity in areas of a building
   that are accessible to the general public, and LANs that are deployed
   by one organization in order to offer connectivity services to other
   organizations (for example, as may occur in a business park or a
   serviced office building). In such environments, it is desirable to
   restrict access to the services offered by the LAN to those users and
   devices that are permitted to make use of those services. 

   Port-based network access control makes use of the physical access
   characteristics of IEEE 802 LAN infrastructures in order to provide a
   means of authenticating and authorizing devices attached to a LAN
   port that has point-to-point connection characteristics, and of
   preventing access to that port in cases in which the authentication

Internet Draft        Port Access Control (802.1X) MIB     July 17, 2003

   and authorization process fails. A port in this context is a single
   point of attachment to the LAN infrastructure. Examples of ports in
   which the use of authentication can be desirable Include the Ports of
   MAC Bridges (as specified in IEEE 802.1D), the ports used to attach
   servers or routers to the LAN infrastructure, and associations
   between stations and access points in IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs.

2.1. Scope

   The purpose of this document is to specify how the management
   operations are made available to a remote manager using the protocol
   and architectural description provided by the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP).

   This MIB is the republishing  of the IEEE Definitions for Port
   Access Control MIB (802.1X) defined in the 802.1X specification
   document.


3. Structure of MIB

   A single MIB module is defined in this clause. Objects in the MIB
   are arranged into groups. Each group is organized as a set of related
   objects. The overall structure and assignment of objects to their
   groups is shown in the following subclauses. IEEE Std 802.1X-2001
   LOCAL AND METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORKS 10.4.1 Relationship to the
   managed objects defined in IEEE 802.1X Clause 9. The following table
   contains cross-references between the objects defined in IEEE 802.1X
   Clause 9 and the MIB objects defined in this clause.

3.1 Relationship to the managed objects defined in IEEE 802.1X

   Note: The relationship sections (9.4.3 Authenticator Diagnostics, 
   9.4.4 Authenticator Session Statistics, etc.) defined related to
   sections in the 801.1X document specification, not this document.

3.2 The PAE System Group

   This group of objects provides management functionality that is not
   specific to the operation of either of the two PAE roles (Supplicant
   and Authenticator). A means of enabling and disabling the operation
   of Port Access Control for the entire system is provided, plus a
   per-Port indication of the protocol version supported and the PAE
   roles supported by the port. As it is not mandatory for all Ports of
   a System to support PAE functionality, there may be Port entries
   that indicate Ports that support neither Supplicant nor
   Authenticator functionality.

3.3 The PAE Authenticator Group 

   This group of objects provides, for each Port of an Authenticator
   [8021XAUTH],  the functionality necessary to allow configuration of
   the operation of the Authenticator PAE, recording and retrieving
   statistical information relating to the operation of the
   Authenticator PAE, and recording and retrieving information relating
   to a session (i.e., the period of time between consecutive
   authentications on the Port). 

3.4 The PAE Supplicant Group

   This group of objects provides, for each Port of a Supplicant
   [8021XSUPP], the functionality necessary to allow configuration of 
   the operation of the Supplicant PAE, and recording and retrieving
   statistical information relating to the operation of the
   Authenticator PAE.

3.5 Relationship to other MIBs

   It is assumed that a system implementing this MIB will also implement
   (at least) the system group defined in MIB-II defined in IETF RFC
   1213 and the interfaces group defined in IETF RFC 2863.

3.6 Relationship to the Interfaces MIB

   IETF RFC 2863, the Interface MIB Evolution, requires that any MIB
   that is an adjunct of the Interface MIB clarify specific areas within
   the Interface MIB. These areas were intentionally left vague in IETF
   RFC 2863 to avoid overconstraining the MIB, thereby precluding
   management of certain media types.

   Section 3.3 of IETF RFC 2863 enumerates several areas that a
   media-specific MIB must clarify. Each of these areas is addressed in
   a following subsection. The implementor is referred to IETF RFC 2863

Bridge Working Group            Expires December 2003         [Page 6]

Internet Draft        Port Access Control (802.1X) MIB     July 17, 2003

   in order to understand the general intent of these areas.

   In IETF RFC 2863, the interfaces group is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems and contains information on an entity's
   interfaces, where each interface is thought of as being attached to
   a subnetwork.

   (Note that this term is not to be confused with subnet, which refers
   to an addressing partitioning scheme used in the Internet suite of
   protocols.) The term segment is sometimes used to refer to such a
   subnetwork.

   Where Port numbers are used in this standard to identify Ports of a
   System, these numbers are equal to the ifIndex value for the
   interface for the corresponding Port.


4 Definitions for the 802.1X-MIB

   In the MIB definition below, should any discrepancy between the
   DESCRIPTION text and the corresponding definition in IEEE 802.1X
   Clause 9 occur, the definition in IEEE 802.1X Clause 9 shall take
   precedence.

   Noted changes between this draft and the IEEE draft are in the 
   MODULE-IDENTITY section. Also dot1xPaePortReauthenticate and 
   dot1xAuthSessionUserName were added to conformance groups.

9.  Security Considerations

   The Port Access Entity defined in this MIB is integral to the 
   security of the network accessed through the Authenticator.  The
   managed objects in this MIB that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of
   read-write or read-create must be considered sensitive in a secure
   environment.  The support of SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   the security of access to the network, for both the Authenticator and
   the Supplicant.  The managed objects in this MIB that have a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of anything other than not-accessible may allow
   users, including authenticated users that have authorised access to
   the secured network, to discover information that may help to
   compromise the access and security of others.  Therefore the support
   of GET operations must also be considered sensitive in a secure
   environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network is
   secure (for example, by using IPSec), there is no control as to who
   on the secure network is allowed to access (read / change / create

   / delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model, IETF RFC 2574, and the View-based
   Access Control Model, IETF RFC 2575, is recommended. It then becomes
   a user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to
   an instance of this MIB is properly configured to give access only to
   those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access
   change / create / delete) them, as appropriate.
