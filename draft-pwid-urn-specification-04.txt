            A Persistent Web IDentifier (PWID) URN Namespace
                    draft-pwid-urn-specification-04

Abstract

   This document specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Persistent
   Web IDentifiers to web material in web archives using the 'pwid'
   namespace identifier.

   The main purpose of the standard is to support specification of
   references that are not covered by other reference techniques: to
   support references to material in web archives with restricted
   access.  Furthermore, it supports persistent technology agnostic
   references to web archives in general, in a form that can work as an
   algorithmic basis for finding web archive resources in general.  An
   additional important benefit is that it can be used in specifying web
   collections, which then can form a persistent computational basis for
   the extract of the archived collection parts.  Since the parts can be
   specified generally, this further allow collections to be specified
   with elements from one or more web archives.

   The PWID is designed for researchers and therefore it is designed as
   general, global, sustainable, humanly readable, technology agnostic,
   persistent and precise web references for web materials in web
   archives.

1.  Introduction

   The URN PWID is a supplement to existing reference standards, where
   the PWID will support references to web archives, including areas
   that are not supported today: support of references to material in
   web archives with restricted access.  Furthermore, it enables
   technology agnostic references to web archives in general, which can
   for instance can be needed for references to web material that is
   dynamic (e.g. a news site) or a specific version of a web material
   (e.g. specific version of the DOI handbook).

   The URN PWID is a form that can work as an algorithmic basis for
   finding the resource.  This also enables basis for computation of
   archived web parts to a collection from one or more web archives.

   Furthermore, the PWID includes information about the resource which
   makes it possible to find alternative resources, in cases where the
   original precise resource have become unavailable.

   The PWID URN is designed to be a persistent reference that is
   general, global and technology agnostic in order to enhance its
   chances for being sustainable.  Furthermore, it is designed to be

   humanly readable and with ability to make precision of the web
   archive resource covers.  This design enables a PWID URN to:

   o  be used for technical solutions e.g. to make them resolvable

   o  cover references to all sorts of materials in web archives

   o  cover references to materials from all sort of web archives

   The motivation for defining a PWID namespace is the growing challenge
   of references to archived web resources, which the PWID as a URN can
   assist in overcoming.  The standard is needed to address web
   materials meeting precision and persistency issues on par precision
   in with traditional references for analogue material.  Furthermore,
   it is needed in order to address web archive resources that are not
   freely available online.  The PWID URN covers both referencing of web
   resources from research papers and definition of web collection/
   corpus.  In detail the challenges are:

   o  Citation guidelines generally do not cover general and persistent
      referencing techniques for web resources that are not registered
      by Persistent Identifier systems (like DOI [DOI]).  However, an
      increasing number of references point to resources that only exist
      on the web, e.g. blogs that turned out to have a historical
      impact.  In order to obtain persistency for a reference, the
      target need to be stable.  As the live web is 'alive' and in
      constant change, persistency can only be obtained by referring to
      archived snapshots of the web.  The PWID URN is therefore focused
      on referencing archived web material in a technology agnostic way
      (research documented in [IPRES2016] and [ResawRef]).

   o  There are many new initiatives for web archive referencing, - most
      of them are centralised solutions which offers harvest and
      referencing, but these cannot be used for existing materials in
      web archives.  Other initiatives only cover open web archives,
      which does not cover material in archives with restricted access
      and where there is a risk of imprecision if a resource in an
      alternative archive is the result of resolving such a resource.
      The PWID URN is needed in order to fill these gaps where other
      techniques are not sufficient.

   o  There are many different requirements for construction of
      collection definitions for web material besides precision and
      persistency.  Recent research have found that various legal and
      sustainability issues leads to a need for a collection to be
      defined by references to the web parts in the collection.  The
      PWID URN is needed in such definitions in order to fulfil these

      requirements and to enable a collection to cover web materials
      from more archives (research documented in [ResawColl]).

   The PWID is especially useful for web material where precision is in
   focus and/or there are references to materials from web archives
   requiring special grants in order to gain access.  The precision
   regards both pointing to the archive where it was found and validated
   against its purpose (other archived versions in other web archives
   may differ both regarding completeness and contents even within short
   time periods) as well as precision about what is actually referred by
   the reference (e.g. is it the page or the whole website).

   Furthermore the PWID is very useful in specification of contents of a
   web collection (also known as web corpus).  Definitions of web
   collections are often needed for extraction of data used in
   production of research results, e.g. for evaluations in the future.
   Current practices today are not persistent as they often use some CDX
   version, which vary for different implementations.

   Strict syntax is needed for the PWID reference in order to ensure
   that it can be used for computational purposes.  This is especially
   relevant for automatic extraction of parts from web collection
   definitions.  Furthermore, readers of research papers are today
   expecting to be able to access a referenced resource by clicking an
   actionable URI, therefore a similar facility will be expected for
   references to available archived web material, which strict syntax
   can make possible.  Examples of technical solutions that is enabled
   are:

   o  resolving of a references and automatic extraction of web
      collection defined by PWID URNs [ResawRef] [ResawColl]

   o  Resolving of a PWID reference by resolving services.  As a start,
      there is work on a prototype that can work for the Danish web
      archive data and open web archives with standard patterns for the
      current technologies.  There may come different implementations
      for resolving which may rely on different protocols and
      application

   The purpose of the PWID is also to express a web archive reference as
   simple as possible and at the same time meeting requirements for
   sustainability, usability and scope.  Therefore, the PWID URN is
   focused on only having the minimum required information to make a
   precise identification of a resource in an arbitrary web archive.
   Resent research have found that this is obtain by the following
   information [ResawRef]:

   o  Identification of web archive

   o  Identification of source:

      *  Archived URI or identifier

      *  Archival timestamp

   o  Intended precision (page, part, subsite etc.)

   The PWID URN represents this information in a human readable way as
   well as a well-defined way that enables technical solutions to
   interpret the URN.

      material in web archives with restricted access.  Furthermore it
      enables technology agnostic references to web archives in general,
      which can for instance can be needed for references to web
      material that is dynamic (e.g. a news site) or a specific version

      The URN PWID is a form that can work as an algorithmic basis for

      Furthermore, the PWID includes information about the resource
      which makes it possible to find alternative resources, in cases
      where the original precise resource have become unavailable.

      The PWID URN is designed to be a persistent reference that is

      *  cover references to materials from all sort of web archives

      The motivation for defining a PWID namespace is the growing
      challenge of references to archived web resources, which the PWID
      as a URN can assist in overcoming.  The standard is needed to
      address web materials meeting precision and persistency issues on

      archive resources that are not freely available online.  The PWID
      URN covers both referencing of web resources from research papers
      and definition of web collection/corpus.  In detail the challenges
      are:

      *  Citation guidelines generally do not cover general and
         persistent referencing techniques for web resources that are
         not registered by Persistent Identifier systems (like DOI
         [DOI]).  However, an increasing number of references point to
         resources that only exist on the web, e.g. blogs that turned

      The PWID URN represents this information in a human readable way
      as well as a well-defined way that enables technical solutions to
      interpret the URN.

   Syntax:

      The syntax of the PWID URN is specified below in Augmented Backus-
      Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] and it conforms to URN syntax defined
      in [RFC8141].  The syntax definition of the PWID URN is:

           pwid-urn = "urn" ":" pwid-NID ":" pwid-NSS

           pwid-NID = "pwid"
           pwid-NSS = archive-id ":" archival-time ":" precision-spec

           archive-id = +( unreserved )

           precision-spec = "part" / "page" / "subsite" / "site"
                    / "collection" / "recording" / "snapshot"
                    / "other"

           archived-item = URI / archived-item-id
           archived-item-id = +( unreserved )

      where

      *  'archival-time' is a UTC timestamp as described in the W3C
         profile of [ISO8601] [W3CDTF] (also defined in [RFC3339]), for
         example YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ.  The 'archival-time' shall
         represent the timestamp that the web archive have recorded for
         the referenced archived URI.  The archival-time may be
         specified at any of the levels of granularity described in
         [W3CDTF], as long as it reflects exactly the granularity of the
         timestamp recorded in the web archive, which is in accordance
         with the WARC standard [ISO28500].

      *  'unreserved' is defined as in [RFC3986]

      *  'precision-spec' values are not case sensitive (i.e.  "PAGE" /
         "PART" / "PaGe" / ... are valid values as well.)

      *  'URI' is defined as in [RFC3986] but where occurrences of "[",
         "]", "?" and "#" are %-encoded in order not to clash with URN
         reserved characters [RFC8141]

      The precision specification is expressing the intended precision
      of the reference.  For example, if the reference is to an html web
      element, this element can be interpreted in several ways:

      *  As just one web part
         Meaning the file containing the html, and precisely this file

      *  A web page
         Meaning that an application like Wayback shows result in a
         browser, and calculates referenced web parts (display
         templates, images etc.) and use these found web parts in the
         result.
         If the full reference only contains the PWID URN for the page,
         this may mean that the archived page can change look over time,
         e.g. in case that parts referred by the page did not exist at
         reference time, but are harvested at a later stage, - or in
         case the web archive's algorithm for calculation of the
         referred web parts are changed and given a different result.
         In order to make a precise reference to a picture in context of
         a web page, the most precise reference will be to provide the



Zierau                     Expires May 8, 2019                  [Page 9]

Internet-DraftA Persistent Web IDentifier (PWID) URN NamespNovember 2018


         PWID URN for the page (with page precision) and the PWID URN
         for the image file part which contains the referred picture
         (with part precision)

      *  As a site or subsite
         Meaning that an application like Wayback shows result in a
         browser showing the web page, - and if there are restricted
         access according to the reference, the application also needs
         to make sure that all parts/pages belonging to the site/subsite
         is available.
         If the full reference only contains the PWID URN for the site/
         subsite, this may mean that the site/subsite can change its
         appearance over time, in the same way as for the web page
         described above.

      The precision specification needs to be part of an URN PWID in
      order to enable the person making the above described precision in
      the reference.  Furthermore this precesion specification will make
      it possible for resolvers to display the referred source in a way
      that corresponds to the precision specification.

      Especially for web materials, there can be different ways to
      represent e.g. a web page, which provides different precision of
      the source as well.  The above examples with part, page, subsite
      and site are addressing the most common access via browser
      functionality like in Wayback.  However, there are also web
      archives that archive snapshots of the web pages for the archived
      URI.  A third option can be to produce a collection of archived
      URIs as basis for browser access instead of letting the web
      archive calculate sub items (which may change over time).  An
      example of the production of such a collection is provided in the
      section about assignment.  Lastly, a web page may be archived via
      a web recording.

      As consequence of the above, there are following valid precision-
      spec values:

      *  part
         the single archived web part harvested as a file from the
         specified URI, e.g. a pdf, an html text, an image

      *  page
         the web page represented by the web page file (e.g. html)
         harvested from the specified URI, where this contents is
         interpreted as a web page with all referred parts relevant to
         display the web page (but where referred parts must be
         calculated as described above), e.g. an html page with referred
         images

      *  subsite
         The referred web page (as described under 'page') where it is
         possible to browse to all references starting with the same
         path as the archived URI

      *  site
         The referred web page (as described under 'page') where it is
         possible to browse to all references in the domain specified in
         the archived URI

      *  collection
         Representation of a collection specification, where it is up to
         the web archive applications to find out how it is rendered
         (e.g. collection specification in the XML format enabling
         interpretation as in the example provided in [ResawColl])

      *  snapshot
         a snapshot (image) representation of web material, e.g. a web
         page

      *  recording
         Representation of a web recording specification where it is up
         to the web archive applications to find out how it is rendered
         (where interpretation could depends on file-suffix for the web
         recording), an example is web recording coded in a WARC file

      *  other
         This is a placeholder to allow reference of a resource of any
         kind with an assigned identifier (by the archive).  In all
         cases, it will be up to the application serving the web archive
         to interpret how this item should be rendered

   Assignment:

      The PWID URNs does not have to be assigned by an authority, as
      they are based on the information created at the time of
      archiving.  In other words: the PWID URNs are created
      independently, but following an algorithm which ensures that the
      referred item can be found if it is still available.  It also has
      the benefit that it includes information to look alternative
      resources e.g. via Memento for some open web archives [MEMENTO] or
      via possibly coming web archive infrastructures.

      A PWID URN is created by finding the relevant information of the
      syntax parts of the PWID on form:

           "urn:pwid:" archive-id ":" archival-time ":" precision-spec
                                  ":" archived-item

Internet-DraftA Persistent Web IDentifier (PWID) URN NamespNovember 2018


      The PWID URN for an archived item in hand can be constructed by
      exchanging the unspecified PWID parts with relevant information,
      as explained in the following:

      *  archive-id (identification of web archive):
         In this version of the standard, it is recommended to use the
         domain of the web archive as the identifier for the web archive
         (e.g. archive.org for Internet Archives open web archive).
         This is recommended, since browsing of this domain page
         typically will lead to description of how to access the web
         archive, e.g. online or by applying for access grants.
         Furthermore, it is more precise than e.g.  the name of the
         archive, since there may be more than one installation of web
         archives in the same organisation, e.g.  archive.org and
         archive-it.org are both covered by Internet Archive.  When a
         registry of web archives are established it will be more
         precise and persistent to use the web archive identifier
         specified in this registry (e.g.  DKWA for the Danish web
         archive with domain netarkivet.dk)

      *  archival-time (archival timestamp):
         The archival time for the archived item in hand may be
         displayed along with the archived item, but there are different
         implementation where it is important to be aware of whether a
         more precise timestamp can be found, and that it is the correct
         timestamp that is used.  For many Wayback implementation the
         precise time can be found as part of the URI used for viewing
         the archived item, e.g. in the example of
         https://web.archive.org/web/20160122112029/http://www.dr.dk
         viewable by the Internet Archives Wayback installation, the
         number 20160122112029 represents the archival time
         2016-01-22T11:20:29Z.  In other installations.  In other
         installations, the most precise time may be found in the URI
         from a search result leading to the resource (which usually
         redirects on basis of a call to the underlying archive index).
         Especially for web pages with frames, there may be cases where
         the actual time is not displayed with the source, since only
         the times for the contents of the frames are displayed.

      *  precision-spec (precision as represented page, part, site,
         snapshot etc.):
         The precision specification specifies how the user should view
         the referred item - either as a specific representation (with
         inherited precision) or by use of tools (e.g. browse web site
         based on calculations or browse on basis of collection of
         specific parts).

         Since the archived URI can have different forms indicated by
         the precision specification, this information may be used in
         resolution and location.
         For most imprecision types are the ones that involves
         calculation, i.e. page, site or subsite.  For items like an
         image that have no references to calculate the precision is
         best described by part, since it also tells that it is a
         precise reference.

      *  archived-item (archived URI or identifier):
         The archived item will be the URI (or identifier assigned for a
         resource by the archive) of the displayed the archived item in
         hand.

      A much easier way to construct PWID URNs is to use tools that
      construct them.  Currently, there is also a prototype for a SOLR-
      Wayback tool (Source at https://github.com/netarchivesuite/
      solrwayback) [PWIDprovider], which can assist in finding the most
      precise reference to an archived web page.  This Wayback version
      can provide all PWID URNs belonging a shown page (with the page
      PWID URN at the top).  For example, in netarkivet.dk, the archived
      URI for the web page http://www.susanlegetoej.dk/shop/handskedyr-
      siameser-killing-8681p.html archived 2008-11-29 01:19:16 UTC, has
      the following parts calculated by the SOLR-Wayback tool:

   Security and Privacy:

      Security and privacy considerations are restricted to accessible
      web resources in web archives.  Resolvers to PWID URNs will
      usually only be possible using the web archives' access tools,
      where security and privacy are covered by these tools.  In such
      cases security and privacy will covered by such tools, since the



Zierau                     Expires May 8, 2019                 [Page 14]

Internet-DraftA Persistent Web IDentifier (PWID) URN NamespNovember 2018


      information used for access has no security and privacy issues.
      In the cases where resolution is made around the archives' access
      tools, there should be made separate analysis.

   Interoperability:

      This is covered by comments in the Syntax description:

      *  the PWID URN conforms to the URI standard defined as in RFC
         3986 [RFC3986] and the URN standard RFC 8141 [RFC8141]

      *  the 'archival-time' of the PWID URN conforms UTC timestamp as
         described in the W3C profile of ISO 8601 [ISO8601] [W3CDTF] and
         is in accordance with the WARC standard ISO 28500 [ISO28500].

      *  the 'archived-item' is either an assigned identifier (the URN
         standard RFC 8141 [RFC8141]) or an URI which conforms to the
         URI standard defined as in RFC 3986 [RFC3986], with %-encodings
         of "[", "]", "#", and "?" in order to conform to the the URN
         standard RFC 8141 [RFC8141]

   Resolution:

      The information in a PWID URN can be used for locating a web
      archive resource, for any kind of web archive.  It includes the
      minimum information for web archive materials, which enables
      resolvability, manually or by a resolver.  Resolution of a PWID
      URN is the primary motivation of making a formal URN definition,
      instead of just textual representation of the for needed parts of
      a PWID.

      Resolution (manually or automatically) is done based on the PWID
      parts:

      *  Web archive identification for web archive holding referred
         resource
         The identifier is either an identifier where location of the
         web archive can be found by looking up the identifier in a
         registry, - or it is the domain name for the web archive, where
         browsing this domain page typically will lead to description of
         how to access the web archive, e.g. online or by applying for
         access grants

      *  Archived URI or identifier of archived item
         If the resource is an archived URI, this URI must be used in
         search for or construction of location of the resource.  If the
         resource is an identifier assigned to the resource (by the




Zierau                     Expires May 8, 2019                 [Page 15]

Internet-DraftA Persistent Web IDentifier (PWID) URN NamespNovember 2018


         archive), it is this identifier that must be used in search for
         or construction of location of the resource

      *  Date and time associated with the archived item
         The archival date and time must be used in search for or
         construction of the location of the resource

      *  Precision of what is referred
         The precision can either contribute to the guidance of
         activating tools to view the referred item e.g. browse the
         referred item as a page on basis of computed closest past,
         browse the referred item on basis of parts specified in a
         collection, or view the referred item as a snapshot.  In the
         example of the snapshot, it also contains a specification of
         which resource to display

      In the following the different resolution techniques are explained
      (manual as well as via a service) .

      An example of a PWID URN is:

         urn:pwid:archive.org:2016-01-22T11:20:29Z:page:http://www.dr.dk

      has the information:

      *  archive.org
         Currently known identifier in form of the Internet Archive
         domain name for their open access web archive.  If Internet
         Archive registered their open web archive in an IANA web
         archive register, this identifier could currently be
         "web.archive.org/web/" for Wayback resolution, or it could be
         "archive.org/pwid/" if a PWID interface was created as
         described below

      *  2016-01-22T11:20:29Z
         UTC date and time associated with the archived URI

      *  page
         Clarification that the reference cover the full web page with
         all its inherited parts selected by the web archive

      *  http://www.dr.dk
         archived URI of item

      Based on the current (2018) knowledge of Internet Archive's open
      access web interface, which has the pattern:

         https://web.archive.org/web/<time>/<uri>



Zierau                     Expires May 8, 2019                 [Page 16]

Internet-DraftA Persistent Web IDentifier (PWID) URN NamespNovember 2018


      If the web archive has registered an identifier for the web
      archive along with the prefix before <time> and <uri>, then this
      identifier can be used to manually (or automatically) deduce the
      prefix via this register

      we can manually (or automatically) deduce an actual (current 2018)
      access https address for Internet Archives Wayback application
      (where only digits from the date is included):

         https://web.archive.org/web/20160122112029/http://www.dr.dk

      The same recipe can be used for other Wayback platforms for open
      web archives.

      Another manual resolution would be to find the resource by use of
      the specified web archive's search interface.  This will work for
      both open web archives and web archives with restricted access.

      It is also noteworthy that the information in the PWID can help in
      finding an alternative resource, in case the original referred
      resource is not available anymore.  The archived URI can be
      searched in other web archives, where the date and time can help
      to find the best match found, e.g. via Memento (for some open web
      archives) or via possibly coming web archive infrastructures.

      Regarding the precision specification, there are not yet any
      implementations which support distinctive rendering depending on
      such a parameter, e.g. only providing html for an html page
      specified as part and the page with calculated elements if
      specified as page etc.  Therefore, the precision specification
      will initially be ignored by a resolution to a Wayback interface.

      A resolving service is currently available in form of code for a
      prototype which run at the Royal Danish Library [PWIDresolver] and
      is planned to be more broadly available.  This service currently
      covers both the Danish web archive (with the proper rights) and
      open web archives with access services based on a patterns
      including archive, archival time and archived URI.  In other
      words, for open web archives it covers conversion of PWID URNs
      for: archive.org, archive-it.org, arquivo.pt, bibalex.org,
      nationalarchives.gov.uk, stanford.edu and vefsafn.is.  For the
      Danish web archive with restricted access, the prototype works
      locally accessing the CDX of the library, and providing access via
      a local proxy to a restricted environment.  The source code for
      this prototype is available from
      https://github.com/netarchivesuite/NAS-research/releases/
      tag/0.0.6.

      Automatic access of a referenced web resource may work on the open
      web for open web archive or in restricted environments for the web
      archives with restricted access.  There may be a need for varied
      operation depending on the available technology and applications,
      e.g.:

      *  Via locally installed browser plug-ins or applications forming
         http/https URIs as described above

      *  Via web research infrastructures
         this is a future solution scenario as a web archive research
         infrastructure do not yet exists.  However, it is a likely
         future scenario, as it is currently being proposed in the RESAW
         community [RESAW]

   Documentation:

      None relevant

   Additional Information:

      The PWID was originally suggested as a URI, where the suggestion
      was based on research between a computer science researcher with
      knowledge of web archiving and researchers from humanity subject
      (History and Literature).  This resulted in the paper "Persistent
      Web References - Best Practices and New Suggestions" [IPRES2016]
      from the iPres 2016 conference.  In this paper, the PWID is
      referred to as WPID.  However, one of the feedbacks has been a
      concern that WPID was interpreted as a PID related to a PID-
      system, e.g. as the DOI.  All though PID does not have a precise
      definition that makes it wrong to call it a "WPID.  The danger is
      that it is confused with PID systems, which is not the intension.
      Consequently, this suggestion names the PWID instead.

      The comments on the drafted PWID URI ([DraftPwidUri]) has been
      that is seems to be a URN rather than a URI.  Which is the reason
      why it is now suggested as a URN.

      At the RESAW 2017 conference there are two related papers: One on
      referencing practices [ResawRef] and one on research data
      management practices [ResawColl].  This practice is also planned
      to be used for Danish web collections.

      The interest for this new PWID has already been shown.  There was
      a lot of response at iPRES.  Especially at the RESAW 2017
      conference, web researchers from digital humanities have expressed
      strong interest in the PWID, since it can fill a gap and make it
      possible for them to make all the references they need to make.

      Therefore, the ambition is to make the PWID URN namespace
      definition a constituent part of a standard being developed in the
      IETF or some other recognized standards body.

      At iPRES 2018, the PWID URN was presented in a digital poster,
      which had a lot of interest around it, and it won the "best
      poster" award [IPRES2018].  A more researcher-oriented version of
      this poster has been accepted to iDCC 2019.

   Revision Information:

      This is the fourth version of PWID as a URN, where remarks from
      the URN PWID reviews have been incorporated.  This large covers
      the following:

      *  It has been more clear clear that the PWID URN is a needed
         supplement to existing standards (especially in Abstract and
         Introduction of RFC, as well as Purpose of URN template)

      *  It has been made more clear that the PWID URN also can be used
         as basis for search of resources that has become unavailable
         (especially in the Introduction of RFC, as well as Purpose and
         Resolution sections of URN template)

      *  The Introduction section of the RFC and the Purpose section of
         the URN template has been aligned.

      *  'Coverage' has been renamed to 'precision' and it has been
         explain in much more details (especially in the Syntax,
         Assignment and Resolution sections)

      *  Use of the term "ambiguity" have been rephrased in order to be
         more correct

      *  'archival-time' and 'URI' have been decribed in more details
         and more correctly (in the Syntax section)

      *  Description of Assignment has been expanded to provived more
         thorough and precise description (in the Assignment section)

      *  Description of Resolution has been expanded to provived more
         thorough and precise description (in the Resolution section)

      *  The Interoperability descriptions have been adjusted to reflect
         the descrions in the Syntax section (in the Interoperability
         section)

      Furthermore the Security and Privacy section has been edited in
      order to become more clear, and the Additional Information section
      has been extended with mentioning of the price winning iPRES 2018
