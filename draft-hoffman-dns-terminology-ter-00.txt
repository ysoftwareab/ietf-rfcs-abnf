             Abbreviations for DNS Transports and Location
                 draft-hoffman-dns-terminology-ter-00

Abstract

   This document adds abbreviations to "DNS Terminology" (RFC 8499) that
   relate to DNS running over various transports, as well as
   abbreviations for DNS resolution at traditional and non-traditional
   locations.

   [[ This is an early attempt at these terms.  They will probably be
   improved over time. []

1.  New Abbreviations

   The following abbreviations are added to Section 6 of [RFC8499].

   Do53: DNS over UDP or TCP as defined in [RFC1035] and its successors.
   Do53 applies to DNS communication between stub resolvers and
   recursive resolvers, and between recursive resolvers and
   authoritative servers.

   DoH: DNS over HTTPS as defined in [RFC8484] and its successors.

   DoT: DNS over TLS as defined in [RFC7858] and its successors.

   RDoT: RDoT specifically means DoT for transport between stub
   resolvers and recursive resolvers.  This term is necessary because it
   is expected that DNS over TLS will later be defined as a transport
   between recursive resolvers and authoritative servers, The "R" in
   RDoT stands for "recursive", the endpoint.

   ADoT: If DoT is later defined as the transport between recursive
   resolvers and authoritative servers, ADoT specifically means DoT for
   transport between recursive resolvers and authoritative servers.  The
   "A" in ADoT stands for "authoritative", the endpoint.

   DaT: DNS resolution between a stub resolver and the recursive
   resolver at the the traditional location configured in the operating
   system.  The "T" stands for "traditional".  DaT is typically
   configured by DHCP, IPv6 router advertisements, or an administrator
   editing a configuration file on a host.  If
   [I-D.ietf-doh-resolver-associated-doh] becomes standardized, DoH to
   the DoH server associated with the traditional resolver would also be
   considered DaT.

   DaO: DNS resolution between a stub resolver and a recursive resolver
   at other than the traditional location configured in the operating
   system.  DaO can be configured by a user changing the configuration
   on a host (such as editing /etc/resolv.conf), or an application
