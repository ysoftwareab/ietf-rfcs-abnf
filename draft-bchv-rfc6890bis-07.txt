1.  Introduction

   In order to support new protocols and practices, the IETF
   occasionally reserves an address block for a special purpose.  For
   example, [RFC1122] reserves an IPv4 address block (0.0.0.0/8) to
   represent the local (i.e., "this") network.  Likewise, [RFC4291]
   reserves an IPv6 address block (fe80::/10) to represent link-scoped
   unicast addresses.

   Several issues have been raised with the documentation of some of the
   special-purpose address blocks in [RFC6890].  Specifically, the
   definition of "global" provided in [RFC6890] was misleading as it
   slightly differed from the generally accepted definition of "global
   scope" (i.e., the ability to forward beyond the boundaries of an
   administrative domain, described as "global unicast" in the IPv6
   addressing architecture [RFC4291]).

   This memo updates the definition of "global" from [RFC6890] for the
   IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registries, augments the fields
   contained within the registries in order to address the confusion
   raised by the definition of "global", and corrects some errors in
   some of the entries in the Special-Purpose Address Registries.

   This memo updates [RFC6890].

2.  IANA Considerations

2.1.  Definition of Global

   [RFC6890] defined the term "global" without taking into consideration
   the multiple uses of the term.  Specifically, IP addresses can be
   global in terms of allocation scope as well as global in terms of
   routing/reachability.  To address this ambiguity, the use of the term
   "global" defined in [RFC6890] is replaced with "globally reachable".
   The following definition replaces the definiton of "global" in the
   IANA Special-Purpose Address Registries:

   o  Globally Reachable - A boolean value indicating whether an IP
      datagram whose destination address is drawn from the allocated
      special-purpose address block is forwardable beyond a specified
      administrative domain.

   The same relationship between the value of "Destination" and the
   values of "Forwardable" and "Global" described in [RFC6890] holds for
   "Globally Reachable".  If the value of "Destination" is FALSE, the
   values of "Forwardable" and "Globally Reachable" must also be FALSE.

   The "Global" column in the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry) and the
   IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv6-special-registry) is
   renamed to "Globally Reachable".

2.2.  Updates to the IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry

   o  Limited Broadcast prefix (255.255.255.255/32) - The Reserved-by-
      Protocol value is changed from False to True.  This change is made
      to align the registry with reservation of the limited broadcast
      address with Section 7 of [RFC0919].

2.3.  Updates to the IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry

   The following changes to the IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry
   involves the insertion of two new footnotes.  These changes require
   the footnotes to be re-numbered.

   o  TEREDO prefix (2001::/32) - The Globally Reachable value is
      changed from False to "N/A [2]".  The [2] footnote states:

      *  See Section 5 of [RFC4380] for details.

   o  EID Space for LISP (2001:5::/32) - All footnotes are incremented
      by 1.

   o  6to4 (2002::/16) - All footnotes are incremented by 1.

   o  Unique-Local (fc00::/7) - The Globally Reachable value is changed
      from False to "False [7]".  The [7] footnote states:

      *  See [RFC4193] for more details on the routability of Unique-
         Local addresses.  The Unique-Local prefix is drawn from the
         IPv6 Global Unicast Address range, but is specified as not
         globally routed.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not raise any security issues beyond those
   discussed in [RFC6890].
