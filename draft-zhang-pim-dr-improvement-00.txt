1.  Introduction

   Multicast technology is deployed more and more.  Many modern
   technology use PIM technology include IPTV, Netmeeting, and so on.
   Except the unicast routes changing will cause the lost of multicast
   packets.  The change of DR also cause the lost of multicast packets.

   When the DR on a share-media LAN is down, other routers will elect
   the new DR until the expiration of Hello-Holdtime.  The default value
   of Hello-Holdtime is 105 seconds.  Although the value of Hello-
   Holdtime can be changed by manual, when the DR is down, there are
   many multicast packets will be lost.  The quality of IPTV and Net
   Meeting will be influenced.

                   Figure 1: An example of multicast network

   For example, there were two routers on one Ethernet.  RouterA was
   elected to DR.  When RouterA was down, the multicast packets are
   discarded until the RouterB was elected to DR and RouterB imported
   the multicast flows successfully.

   We suppose there was only a RouterA in the Ethernet at first in
   Figure 1.  RouterA was the DR who was responsible for forwarding
   multicast flows.  When RouterB connected the Ethernet, RouterB would
   be elected to DR because a high priority.  So RouterA stopped
   forwarding multicast packets.  The multicast flows recovered until
   RouterB joined the group and imported multicast flows.

2.  Terminology

   Backup Designated Router (BDR): A shared-media LAN like Ethernet may
   have multiple PIM-SM routers connected to it.  Except for DR, a other
   router who will act on behalf of directly connected hosts with
   respect to the PIM-SM protocol.  But BDR will not forward the flows.
   When DR is down, the BDR will forward multicast flows immediately.  A
   single BDR is elected per interface like the DR.

3.  PIM hello message format

   In RFC4601, the PIM hello message format was defined.  In this
   document, we define two new option values which are including Type,
   Length, and Value.

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

3.1.  DR Option format

   o  OptionType : The value is TBD.

   o  OptionLength: If the network is support IPv4, the OptionLength is
      4 octets.  If the network is support IPv6, the OptionLength is 16
      octets.

   o  OptionValue: The OptionValue is IP address of DR.  If the network
      is support IPv4, the value is IPv4 address of DR.  If the network
      is support IPv6, the value is IPv6 address of DR.

3.2.  BDR Option format

   o  OptionType : The value is TBD.

   o  OptionLength: If the network is support IPv4, the OptionLength is
      4 octets.  If the network is support IPv6, the OptionLength is 16
      octets.

   o  OptionValue: The OptionValue is IP address of BDR.  If the network
      is support IPv4, the value is IPv4 address of BDR.  If the network
      is support IPv6, the value is IPv6 address of BDR.

4.  The Protocol Treatment

   A new router start sending hello messages with the values of DR and
   BDR are all set to 0 after its interface is enabled in PIM on a
   share-media LAN.  When the router receive hello messages from other
   routers on the same share-media LAN, the router will check if the
   value of DR or BDR is filled.  If the value of DR or BDR is filled
   with IP address of router who is sending hello messages, the router
   will store the IP address.

   Then the router compare the priority and IP address itself to the
   stored IP address of DR and BDR accord to the algorithm of RFC 4601.
   If the router notice that it is better to be DR than the existed DR
   or BDR.  The router will make itself the BDR, and send new hello
   messages with its IP address as BDR and existed DR.  If the router
   notices that the existed DR is most priority in the share-media LAN,
   but the existed BDR is set to 0x0 in the received hello messages, or
   the existed BDR is not better than the new router to be DR except
   existed DR, the router will elect itself to BDR.  If the router
   notices that it is not better to be DR than existed DR and BDR, the
   router will respect the PIM protocol.

   When the new router become the new BDR, the router will join the
   existed multicast groups, import multicast flows from upstream
   routers.  But the BDR MUST not forward the multicast flows to avoid
   the duplicate multicast packets in the share-media LAN.  The router
   will monitor the DR.  When the DR unavailable because of the down or
   other reasons.  The BDR will forward multicast flows immediately.

4.1.  Sending Hello Messages

   When a new router's interface is enabled in PIM protocol, the router
   send hello messages with the values of DR and BDR are filled with
   0x0.

Internet-Draft             PIM DR IMPROVEMENT                  July 2015


   When a new router sets itself BDR after receive hello messages from
   other routers, the router send hello messages with the value of DR is
   set to the IP address of existed DR and the value of BDR is set to
   the IP address of the router itself.

   When a new router notices the existed DR and BDR is more priority
   than itself.  The router will send hello messages with the values of
   DR and BDR are filled with existed DR and BDR.

   When a existed router sets itself non DR and non BDR after receive
   hello messages from other routers, the router will send hello
   messages with the value of DR is set to existed DR and the value of
   BDR is set to new BDR.

4.2.  Receiving Hello Messages

   When the values of DR and BDR which are carried by hello messages are
   received is all set to 0x0, the router MUST elect the DR due to the
   algorithm of RFC4601.  And elect a new BDR which are the best choice
   except DR.

   When the value of DR which is carried by received hello messages is
   not 0x0, and the value of BDR is set to 0x0, the router will elect
   itself to BDR.

   When the values of DR and BDR that carried by received hello messages
   all are not set to 0x0.  The router will mark the existed DR, and
   compare it and the BDR in message.  When the router notice it is
   better to be DR than existed BDR.  The router will elect itself to
   the BDR.

   When a router receives a new hello message with the values of DR and
   BDR are set to 0x0.  The router will compare the new router with
   itself.  If the router noticed the new router is better to be DR than
   itself, the router will set the BDR to the new router.

4.3.  The election of DR and BDR

   When all the routers on a shared-media LAN are start to work on the
   same time, the election of DR is same as RFC4601.  And all the
   routers will elect a BDR which is inferior to DR.  The hello messages
   sent by all the routers are same with the value of DR and BDR are all
   set.

   When a new router start to work on a shared-media LAN and receive
   hello messages from other routers which are set DR value at least.
   The new router will not change the existed DR even if it is superior

   to the existed DR.  If the new router is superior to existed BDR, the
   new router will replace the place of BDR on the LAN.

   When an existed router receives hello messages from a new router, and
   the existed router is DR on the LAN, the existed DR router will
   compare the new router and all the other routers on the LAN.  If the
   new router is superior to the other entire router, the existed DR
   router will treat the new router as new BDR.

   When an existed router receives hello messages from a new router, and
   the existed router is BDR on the LAN, the existed BDR will compare
   itself and the new router.  If the new router is superior to itself,
   the existed BDR will elect the new router as new BDR, and set itself
   for nothing.

   When an existed router receives hello messages from a new router, and
   the existed router is neither DR nor BDR on the LAN, the existed
   router will compare the existed BDR and the new router.  If the new
   router is superior to the other entire router, the existed DR router
   will treat the new router as new BDR.

5.  Deployment suggestion

   If there are two and more routers on a share-media LAN, and the
   quality of LAN will be influenced by the lost of multicast packets,
   the LAN should deploy the function of DR and BDR in this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   For general PIM Security Considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate OptionTypes in TLVs of hello message.
   Include DR and BDR.
