                          Status of this Memo

   This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with
   all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026. Internet-Drafts are working
   documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas,
   and its working groups.  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or made obsolete by other documents at
   any time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as work in progress.

                               Abstract

   This document gives the object identifiers for the elliptic curve
   domain pararmeters that the National Institute of Standards and
   Techology recommends in its publication "Digital Signature
   Standard" (Federal Infomration Processing Standards 186-2).  These
   elliptic curve domain prameters are defined to align PKIX with
   other ECC implementations and standards.  It should be noted that
   this document is not self-contained.  It uses the notations and
   definitions of [PKIX].

INTERNET-DRAFT       NIST Recommended ECDPs for PKIX           June 2002


1.  Introduction

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

   This document specifies algorithm identifiers and ASN.1 [X.660]
   encoding formats for digital signatures and subject public keys
   used in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).  This
   specification supplements [RFC 3279], "Algorithms and Identifiers
   for the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and
   Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile " Implementations of this
   specification MUST also conform to RFC 3279.

   This specification describes the object identifiers used when
   identifying elliptic curve domain parameters for elliptic curve
   public keys.  In particular it describes some object identifiers in
   [ANSI X9.63] "American National Standard for Financial Services
   X9.63-2001: Public Key Cryptography for the Financial Services
   Industry: Key Agreement and Key Transport Using Elliptic Curve
   Cryptography". These object identifiers are the named curves of
   [ANSI X9.63] and are convenient way to identify certain elliptic
   domain parameters.  These curves and their object identifiers are
   also given in [SEC 2] "Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain
   Parameters".

   NIST also recommends these named curves in [FIPS 186-2] "Digital
   Signature Standard (DSS)".

   The fifteen NIST recommended elliptic curve domain parameters have
   the object identifiers named

     secp192r1, sect163k1, sect163r2,  
     secp224r1, sect233k1, sect233r1,  
     secp256r1, sect283k1, sect283r1,  
     secp384r1, sect409k1, sect409r1,  
     secp521r1, sect571k1, sect571r1. 

   The values of these object identifiers are given in [ANSI X9.63],
   [SEC 2] and Section 2 of this specification.  The descriptions of
   these elliptic curve domain parameters are given in [ANSI X9.63]
   and [SEC 2].

2. OIDs for NIST Recommnded EC Domain Paramters

   The object identifiers for NIST recommended curves extend the
   object identifiers anxi-x9-62 and elliptiCurve whose values are
   
      ansi-x9-62 OBJECT IDENTIFER ::= {
	    iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) 10045
      }

      ellipticCurve OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {
        iso(1) identified-organization(3) certicom(132) curve(0)
      }

   The values of the object identifiers for the fifteen NIST
   recommended curves are

     secp192r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ansi-x9-62 curves(3) prime(1) 1 } 
     sect163k1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ellipticCurve 1 } 
     sect163r2 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ellipticCurve 15 } 
     secp224r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ellipticCurve 33 } 
     sect233k1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ellipticCurve 26 } 
     sect233r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ellipticCurve 27 } 
     secp256r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ansi-x9-62 curves(3) prime(1) 7 } 
     sect283k1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ellipticCurve 16 } 
     sect283r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ellipticCurve 17 } 
     secp384r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ellipticCurve 34 } 
     sect409k1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ellipticCurve 36 } 
     sect409r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ellipticCurve 37 }   
     secp521r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ellipticCurve 35 } 
     sect571k1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ellipticCurve 38 } 
     sect571r1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { ellipticCurve 39 }

  intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
  pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
  this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
  might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it
  has made any effort to identify any such rights. Information on the
  IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and
  standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11. Copies of
  claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances
  of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made
  to obtain a general license or permission for the use of such
  proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification
  can be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.
