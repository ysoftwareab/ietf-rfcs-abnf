1.  Introduction

   ITU-T G.722.1[ITU.G7221] is a low complexity coder, it compresses
   50Hz - 14kHz audio signals into one of the following bit rates, 24
   kbit/s, 32 kbit/s or 48 kbit/s.

   The coder may be used for speech, music and other types of audio.

   Some of the applications for which this coder is suitable are:

   o  Real-time communications such as videoconferencing and telephony.

   o  Streaming audio

   o  Archival and messaging

   A fixed frame size of 20 ms is used, and for any given bit rate the
   number of bits in a frame is a constant.

3.  RTP payload format for G.722.1

   ITU-T G.722.1[ITU.G7221] uses 20 ms frames and a sampling rate clock
   of 16 kHz or 32kHz, so the RTP[RFC3550] timestamp MUST be in units of
   1/16000 or 1/32000 of a second.  The RTP payload for G.722.1 has the
   format shown in Figure 1.  No additional header specific to this
   payload format is required.

                     Figure 1: RTP payload for G.722.1

   The encoding and decoding algorithm can change the bit rate at any
   20ms frame boundary, but no bit rate change notification is provided
   in-band with the bit stream.  Therefore, a separate out-of-band
   method is REQUIRED to indicate the bit rate (see section 6 for an
   example of signaling bit rate information using SDP).  For the
   payload format specified here, the bit rate MUST remain constant for
   a particular payload type value.  An application MAY switch bit rates
   from packet to packet by defining two payload type values and
   switching between them.

   The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new packet format is
   outside the scope of this document, and will not be specified here.
   It is expected that the RTP profile for a particular class of
   applications will assign a payload type for this encoding, or if that
   is not done then a payload type in the dynamic range shall be chosen.

   The number of bits within a frame is fixed, and within this fixed
   frame G.722.1 uses variable length coding (e.g., Huffman coding) to
   represent most of the encoded parameters.  All variable length codes
   are transmitted in order from the left most (most significant - MSB)
   bit to the right most (least significant - LSB) bit, see [ITU.G7221]
   for more details.

   The use of Huffman coding means that it is not possible to identify
   the various encoded parameters/fields contained within the bit stream
   without first completely decoding the entire frame.  For the purposes
   of packetizing the bit stream in RTP, it is only necessary to

   consider the sequence of bits as output by the G.722.1 encoder, and
   present the same sequence to the decoder.  The payload format
   described here maintains this sequence.

   When operating at 24 kbit/s, 480 bits (60 octets) are produced per
   frame.  When operating at 32 kbit/s, 640 bits (80 octets) are
   produced per frame.  When operating at 48 kbit/s, 960 bits (120
   octets) are produced per frame.  Thus, all three bit rates allow for
   octet alignment without the need for padding bits.

   Figure 2 illustrates how the G.722.1 bit stream MUST be mapped into
   an octet aligned RTP payload.

           Figure 2:  The G.722.1 encoder bit stream is split into
                      a sequence of octets (60, 80 or 120 depending on
                      the bit rate), and each octet is in turn
                      mapped into an RTP octet.

   The ITU-T standardized bit rates for G.722.1 are 24 kbit/s or
   32kbit/s at 16 Khz sample rate, and 24 kbit/s, 32 kbit/s or 48 kbit/s
   at 32 Khz sample rate.  However, the coding algorithm itself has the
   capability to run at any user specified bit rate (not just 24, 32 and
   48 kbit/s) while maintaining an audio bandwidth of 50 Hz to 14 kHz.
   This rate change is accomplished by a linear scaling of the codec
   operation, resulting in frames with size in bits equal to 1/50 of the
   corresponding bit rate.

Internet-Draft                    G7221                        June 2005


   When operating at non-standard rates the payload format MUST follow
   the guidelines illustrated in Figure 2.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   values in the range 16000 to 48000 be used, and that any value MUST
   be a multiple of 400 (this maintains octet alignment and does not
   then require (undefined) padding bits for each frame if not octet
   aligned).  For example, a bit rate of 16.4 kbit/s will result in a
   frame of size 328 bits or 41 octets which are mapped into RTP per
   Figure 2.

3.1  Multiple G.722.1 frames in a RTP packet

   More than one G.722.1 frame may be included in a single RTP packet by
   a sender.

   Senders have the following additional restrictions:

   o  Sender SHOULD NOT include more G.722.1 frames in a single RTP
      packet than will fit in the MTU of the RTP transport protocol.

   o  All frames contained in a single RTP packet MUST be of the same
      length, that is they MUST have the same bit rate (octets per
      frame).

   o  Frames MUST NOT be split between RTP packets.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the number of frames contained within an RTP
   packet be consistent with the application.  For example, in a
   telephony application where delay is important, then the fewer frames
   per packet the lower the delay, whereas for a delay insensitive
   streaming or messaging application, many frames per packet would be
   acceptable.

3.2  Computing the number of G.722.1 frames

   Information describing the number of frames contained in an RTP
   packet is not transmitted as part of the RTP payload.  The only way
   to determine the number of G.722.1 frames is to count the total
   number of octets within the RTP packet, and divide the octet count by
   the number of expected octets per frame.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section describes the media types and names associated with this
   payload format.  The section registers the media types, as per
   RFC2048[RFC2048]

4.1  Registration of MIME media type audio/G7221

   MIME media type name: audio

   MIME subtype name: G7221

   Required parameters:

   bitrate: the data rate for the audio bit stream.  This parameter is
   mandatory because the bit rate is not signaled within the G.722.1 bit
   stream.  At the standard G.722.1 bit rates, the value MUST be either
   24000 or 32000 at 16 Khz sample rate, and 24000, 32000  or 48000 at
   32 Khz sample rate.  If using the non-standard bit rates, then it is
   RECOMMENDED that values in the range 16000 to 48000 be used, and that
   any value MUST be a multiple of 400 (this maintains octet alignment
   and does not then require (undefined) padding bits for each frame if
   not octet aligned).

   Optional parameters:

   ptime: RECOMMENDED duration of each packet in milliseconds.

   Encoding considerations:

   This type is only defined for transfer via RTP [RFC3550]

   Security considerations: See Section 6

   Interoperability considerations: Terminals SHOULD offer a media type
   at 16 Khz sample rate in order to interoperate with terminals that do
   not support the new 32 Khz sample rate.

   Published specification: See ITU-T Recommendation G.722.1 for
   encoding algorithm details.

   Applications which use this media type:

   Audio and Video streaming and conferencing applications.

   Additional information: none

5.  SDP Parameters

   The media types audio/G7221 are mapped to fields in the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP)[RFC2327] as follows:

   o The media name in the "m=" line of SDP MUST be audio.

   o The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be G7221 (the
   MIME subtype).

   o The clock rate in the "a=rtpmap" line MUST be 16000 or 32000.

   o One optional parameter MUST be included in the "a=fmtp" line of
   SDP.  One bitrate SHALL be defined for each payload type.

5.1  Usage with the SDP Offer Answer Model

   When offering G.722.1 over RTP using SDP in an Offer/Answer
   model[RFC3264]  the following considerations are necessary.

   There are two clock rates defined for the updated G.722.1.
   RFC3047[RFC3047] supported only the 16 Khz clock rate.  Therefore a
   system that wants to use G.722.1 SHOULD offer a payload type with
   clock rate of 16000.

   An example of an offer that includes a 16000 and 32000 clock rate is:

             m=audio 49000 RTP/AVP 121 122

             a=rtpmap:121 G7221/16000

             a=fmtp:121 bitrate=24000

             a=rtpmap:122 G7221/32000

             a=fmtp:121 bitrate=48000

6.  Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [3], and any appropriate RTP profile.  This implies
   that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption.
   Because the data compression used with this payload format is applied
   end-to-end, encryption may be performed after compression so there is
   no conflict between the two operations.

   A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encodings using
   compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end
   computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams
   into the stream which are complex to decode and cause the receiver to
   be overloaded.  However, this encoding does not exhibit any
   significant non-uniformity.

   As with any IP-based protocol, in some circumstances a receiver may
   be overloaded simply by the receipt of too many packets, either
   desired or undesired.  Network-layer authentication may be used to
   discard packets from undesired sources, but the processing cost of
   the authentication itself may be too high.
