Internet-Draft  GMPLS Signaling Extensions for G.709 am3       June 2009


1.  Introduction

   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] extends
   MPLS from supporting Packet Switching Capable (PSC) interfaces and
   switching to include support of four new classes of interfaces and
   switching: Layer-2 Switching (L2SC), Time-Division Multiplex (TDM),
   Lambda Switch (LSC), and Fiber-Switch (FSC) Capable.  A functional
   description of the extensions to MPLS signaling that are needed to
   support these new classes of interfaces and switching is provided in
   [RFC3471].  [RFC3473] describes the RSVP-TE-specific formats and
   mechanisms needed to support all four classes of interfaces.
   [RFC4328] describes the technology details that are specific to G.709
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN) as specified in the ITU-T G.709
   recommendation [ITUT-G709].

   This document extends the concepts presented in [RFC4328] with the
   technology details introduced in G.709 Optical Transport Networks
   (OTN) with ITU-T G.709 amendment 3 recommendation.

3.  GMPLS Extensions for G.709 amendment 3 - Overview

   G.709 amendment 3 introduces new signals type in the two layers
   constituting the digital transport hierarchy:

   - Optical Channel Transport Unit (OTUk):

      .  OTU4

   - Optical Channel Data Unit (ODUk):

      .  ODU0
      .  ODU2e
      .  ODU4
      .  ODUflex

   It also add a new Tributary Slot (TS) granularity for both the new
   and the old ODUk signals.

   [ITUT-G709-AMD3] introduces ODU4 mapping into OTU4 (and its related
   100Gbps optical channel), and new ODUk multiplexing.  It refers to
   the multiplexing of ODUj (j = 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, flex) into an ODUk (k >
   j) signal, in particular:

   o  ODU0 into ODU1 multiplexing

   o  ODU0, ODU1, ODUflex into ODU2 multiplexing (with 1.25Gbps TS
      granularity)

   o  ODU0, ODU1, ODUflex and ODU2 into ODU3 multiplexing (with 1.25Gbps
      TS granularity)

   o  ODU2e into ODU3 multiplexing (with 2.5Gbps TS granularity)

   o  ODU0, ODU1, ODU2, ODU2e, ODUflex into ODU4 multiplexing (with
      1.25Gbps TS granularity)

4.  Generalized Label Request

   The Generalized Label Request as defined in [RFC3471], includes a
   common part (i.e. used for any switching technology) and a technology
   dependent part (i.e. the traffic parameters).  Both parts have been
   extended by [RFC4328] in order to accommodate GMPLS signaling to the
   G.709 transport plane recommendation (see [ITUT-G709]).

   All these extensions are still valid for G.709 amendment 3 transport
   plane recommendation and only the technology dependent part is
   further extended to accommodate GMPLS signaling to the new signals
   introduced by [ITUT-G709-AMD3].

4.1.  G.709 Traffic Parameters

   The G.709 traffic parameters are defined as follows in [RFC4328]
   Section 3.2:

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |  Signal Type  |   Reserved    |              NMC              |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |              NVC              |        Multiplier (MT)        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                           Reserved                            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   In this frame, NMC stands for Number of Multiplexed Components, NVC
   for Number of Virtual Components and MT for Multiplier.  Each of
   these fields is tailored to support G.709 LSP requests.  The RSVP-TE
   encoding of the G.709 traffic-parameters is detailed in [RFC4328]
   Section 6.  [ITUT-G709-AMD3] defines new signals and Digital Path
   layer multiplexing combinations, therefore, the Signal Type and
   Number of Multiplexed Components fields need to be extended.

4.1.1.  Signal Type (ST)

   This field (8 bits) indicates the type of G.709 Elementary Signal
   that comprises the requested LSP.  Since [ITUT-G709-AMD3] defines new
   signals in both the ODUk layers and the OCh layer, additional Signal
   Type code-points for G.709 amendment 3 is defined that enlarges the
   existing ST code-point defined in [RFC4328].

   Consequently, the following additional code-points for the Signal
   Type are defined:

         Value     Type
         -----     ----
           4       ODU4 (i.e., 100 Gbps)
           9       Och at 100 Gbps
           10      ODU0 (i.e., 1.25 Gbps)
           15      ODUflex (i.e., 1.25*ts Gbps)
           47      ODU2e (i.e, 10,25 Gbps)

   The same rules defined in [RFC4328] are still valid for the new
   signals:

   o  if the LSP Encoding Type value is the G.709 Digital Path layer
      then the valid values are the ODUk signals (k = 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3, 4
      or flex)

   o  if the LSP Encoding Type value is the G.709 Optical Channel layer
      then the valid values are the OCh at 2.5, 10, 40 or 100 Gbps

4.1.2.  Number of Multiplexed Components (NMC)

   The NMC field (16 bits) indicates the number of ODU tributary slots
   used by an ODUj when multiplexed into an ODUk (k >= j) for the
   requested LSP.  [ITUT-G709-AMD3] defines new multiplexing cases for
   ODUk, therefore new ST, NMC combinations needs to be introduced in
   addition to those defined in [RFC4328] Section 3.2.2:

   o  ODU1 connections multiplexed into one ODU2, ODU3 or ODU4 payload
      with 1.25Gbps TS granularity, the NMC field MUST be set to 2.

   o  ODU0 connections multiplexed into one ODU1, ODU2, ODU3 or ODU4
      payload with 1.25Gbps TS granularity, the NMC field MUST be set to
      1.

   o  ODU2 connections multiplexed into one ODU3 or ODU4 payload with
      1.25Gbps TS granularity, the NMC field MUST be set to 8.

   o  ODU2e connections multiplexed into one ODU3 payload with 2.5Gbps
      TS granularity, the NMC field MUST be set to 5.

   o  ODU2e connections multiplexed into one ODU4 payload with 1.25Gbps
      TS granularity, the NMC field MUST be set to 10.

   o  ODUflex connection multiplexed into one ODUk (k > ts) payload with
      1.25Gbps TS granularity, the NMC field MUST be set to ts.

4.1.3.  Number of Virtual Components (NVC)

   NVC field is the same of that defined in [RFC4328] Section 3.2.3.

4.1.4.  Multiplier (MT)

   MT field is the same of that defined in [RFC4328] Section 3.2.4.

5.  Generalized Label

   The Generalized Label is defined in [RFC3471].  The format of the
   corresponding RSVP-TE GENERALIZED_LABEL object is specified in
   [RFC3473] Section 2.2.  The Generalized Label value space for Digital
   Paths and Optical Channels based on [ITUT-G709] specification is
   specified in [RFC4328] Section 4.1.  This section describes the
   Generalized Label value space for Digital Paths and Optical Channels
   for the new signals and Digital Path layer multiplexing combinations
   introduced in [ITUT-G709-AMD3].

   If the ST, NMC combination is one of those defined in Section 4.1.2,
   then the new Generalized Label format MUST be used, otherwise the
   [RFC4328] format MUST be used.

5.1.  ODUk Label Space

   At the Digital Path layer (i.e.  ODUk layers), G.709 and G.709
   amendment 3 defines seven different client payload bit rates.  An
   Optical Data Unit (ODU) frame has been defined for each of these bit
   rates.  ODUk refers to the frame at bit rate k, where k =0 (for 1.25
   Gpbs), k = 1 (for 2.5 Gbps), 2 (for 10 Gbps), 2e for (10.25 Gbps), 3
   (for 40 Gbps), 4 (for 100 Gbps) or flex (for 1.25*ts Gbps).

   In addition to the support of ODUk mapping into OTUk, the G.709 label
   space supports the sub-levels of ODUk multiplexing.  ODUk
   multiplexing refers to multiplexing of ODUj (j = 0, 1, 2, 2e, 3,
   flex) into an ODUk (k > j).

   More precisely, ODUj into ODUk multiplexing (k > j) is defined when
   an ODUj is multiplexed into an ODUk Tributary Unit Group (i.e. an
   ODTUG constituted by ODU tributary slots) which is mapped into an
   OPUk.  The resulting OPUk is mapped into an ODUk and the ODUk is
   mapped into an OTUk.  Tributary slot granularity may be at 2.5 Gbps
   or 1.25 Gbps.

   Therefore, the label space structure is a tree whose root is an OTUk
   signal and leaves the ODUj signals (k >= j) that can be transported
   via the tributary slots and switched between these slots.  A G.709
   Digital Path layer label defined in [RFC4328] and a G.709 amd3
   Digital Path Layer label identifies the exact position of a
   particular ODUj signal in an ODUk multiplexing structure.

   The G.709 amd3 Digital Path Layer label or ODUk amd3 label has the
   following format:

     +---+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Reserved bits MUST be set to zero when sent and SHOULD be ignored
   when received.

   The specification of the fields t1, t2, t3 and t4 self-consistently
   characterizes the ODUk label space.  The value space for the t1, t2,
   t3 and t4 fields is defined as follows:

   1.  t1 (2-bit):

       *  t1=[1..2] indicates the tributary slot (t1th) used by the ODU0
          (via ODTU01) in an ODTUG1 mapped into an ODU1 (via OPU1).

       *  t1 is not significant for the other ODUk signal types (i.e.,
          t1 value MUST be set to 0 and ignored).

   2.  t2 (5-bit):

       *  t2=[1..8] indicates the tributary slot (t2th) used by the ODU0
          (via ODTU02) in an ODTUG2 mapped into an ODU2 (via OPU2).

       *  t2=[9..16] indicates the tributary slot (t2th-8) used by the
          ODU1 (via ODTU12) in an ODTUG2 mapped into an ODU2 (via OPU2).

       *  t2=[17..24] indicates the tributary slot (t2th-16) used by the
          ODUflex (via ODTU2.ts) in an ODTUG2 mapped into an ODU2 (via
          OPU2).

       *  t2 is not significant for the other ODUk signal types (i.e.,
          t2 value MUST be set to 0 and ignored).

   3.  t3 (8-bit):

       *  t3=[1..32] indicates the tributary slot (t3th) used by the
          ODU0 (via ODTU03) in an ODTUG3 mapped into an ODU3 (via OPU3).

       *  t3=[33..64] indicates the tributary slot (t3th-32) used by the
          ODU1 (via ODTU13) in an ODTUG3 mapped into an ODU3 (via OPU3).

       *  t3=[65..96] indicates the tributary slot (t3th-64) used by the
          ODU2 (via ODTU23) in an ODTUG3 mapped into an ODU3 (via OPU3).

       *  t3=[97..128] indicates the tributary slot (t3th-96) used by
          the ODUflex (via ODTU3.ts) in an ODTUG3 mapped into an ODU3
          (via OPU3).

       *  t3=[129..144] indicates the tributary slot (t3th-128) used by
          the ODU2e (via ODTU2e3) in an ODTUG3 mapped into an ODU3 (via
          OPU3).

       *  t3 is not significant for the ODU4 signal type (i.e., t3 value
          MUST be set to 0 and ignored).

   4.  t4 (9-bit):

       *  t4=1 indicates an ODU4 signal

       *  t4=[2..81] indicates the tributary slot (t4th-1) used by the
          ODU0 (via ODTU4.1) in an ODTUG4 mapped into an ODU4 (via
          OPU4).

       *  t4=[82..161] indicates the tributary slot (t4th-81) used by
          the ODU1 (via ODTU4.2) in an ODTUG4 mapped into an ODU4 (via
          OPU4).

       *  t4=[162..241] indicates the tributary slot (t4th-161) used by
          the ODU2 (via ODTU4.8) in an ODTUG4 mapped into an ODU4 (via
          OPU4).

       *  t4=[242..321] indicates the tributary slot (t4th-241) used by
          the ODU3 via ODTU4.32) in an ODTUG4 mapped into an ODU4 (via
          OPU4).

       *  t4=[322..401] indicates the tributary slot (t4th-321) used by
          the ODUflex (via ODTU4.ts) in an ODTUG4 mapped into an ODU4
          (via OPU4).

       *  t4=[402..481] indicates the tributary slot (t4th-401) used by
          the ODU2e (via ODTU4.8) in an ODTUG4 mapped into an ODU4 (via
          OPU4).

5.2.  Label Distribution Rules

   Label distribution rules are the same of those defined in [RFC4328]
   Section 4.2.

6.  RSVP-TE Signaling Protocol Extensions

   RSVP-TE will reuse the protocol extensions defined in [RFC4328]
   Section 6. and does not need to be further extended.

   When a amendment 3 aware node receives a Generalized Label Request it
   can infer the label format from the ST, NMC pair.  Instead when a non
   amendment 3 aware node receives a Generalized Label Request for a
   signals introduced in [ITUT-G709-AMD3], it will not support the
   requested Signal Type, NMC values.  Then the receiver node MUST
   generate a PathErr message with a "Traffic Control Error/Service
   unsupported" indication (see [RFC2205]) as specified in [RFC4328].

9.  Security Considerations

   The procedures described in this document rely completely on RSVP-TE
   messages and mechanism.  The use of H bit set in Admin Status Object
   basically informs the receiving entity that no operations are to be
   done over Data Plane as consequence of such special signaling flow.
   Using specially flagged signaling messages we want to limit the
   function of setup and tear down messages to Control Plane, making
   them not effective over related Data Plane resource usage.  So, no
   additional or special issues are arisen by adopting this procedure,
   that aren't already brought up by the use of the same messages,
   without H bit setting, for LSP control.  For RSVP-TE Security please
   refer to [RFC3473].
