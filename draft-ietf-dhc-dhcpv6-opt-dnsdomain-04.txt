Internet-Draft     domain suffix option for DHCPv6         November 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a new option for DHCPv6 [RFC3315] that 
   provides a mechanism for specifying a domain name suffix. Using this
   option, the DHCPv6 server can specify a domain name suffix to the 
   DHCPv6 client. 

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
   
   Domain suffix
                 In this document, the domain suffix is defined as the
                 suffix of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). It is
                 starts with lower-level domain name and continues all 
                 the way up to the top-level domain name.

   This document should be read in conjunction with the DHCPv6 
   specification, [RFC3315]. Definitions for terms and acronyms used in
   this document are defined in RFC3315.


2.  Domain Suffix Option

   The domain suffix option for DHCPv6 is used by the DHCPv6 server to 
   tell the DHCPv6 client the domain suffix that the DHCPv6 server 
   administrator has specified for that DHCPv6 client.

   The format of the domain suffix option is:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |          option-code          |         option-length         |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                                                               |
    ~                          domain suffix                        ~
    |                                                               |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   option-code:     OPTION_DOMAIN_SUFFIX (TBD).

   option-length:   length of the "domain suffix" field in octets.

   domain suffix:   the specification of a domain suffix.

Internet-Draft     domain suffix option for DHCPv6         November 2006


   The domain suffix in the 'domain suffix' field MUST be encoded as
   specified in section of RFC3315 titled "Representation and use of 
   domain names", except that it SHOULD only include one domain name, 
   being a series of labels terminated by exactly one root label.

   If more than one root label is present, the DHCP client 
   implementations MUST select the first name, ignoring any subsequent
   labels.
   
2.1  Usage
 
   A DHCPv6 client MUST include the option code in Option Request 
   Option [RFC3315] if it desires the domain suffix option, and the 
   DHCPv6 server SHOULD include this option in an Advertise or Reply 
   if requested by the client in the Option Request Option.
   
   A DHCPv6 server may provide different values for the domain suffix
   option to different clients.  The mechanism for choosing which
   suffix to assign to which client is a matter of implementation and 
   administrative policy, and is therefore not specified in this 
   document.

      
3.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations in DHCP are described in section 23,
   "Security Considerations" of RFC3315.
 

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a DHCPv6 option code for the 
   OPTION_DOMAIN_SUFFIX.

Appendix:  Examples

   The examples defined below are intended to give a reference usage of
   the domain suffix option. 

   Example 1: Used for host
   
   One obvious example for the option is in a case where a DHCP client
   is not configured to assert a particular domain.  The client could 
   request the domain suffix in the ORO option to request the domain
   name it could use, as the usage for option 15 in DHCPv4.
   
   
   Example 2: Used for IPv6 residential gateway 
   
   In IPv6 home network, it is easy to imagine that each device can get
   a globally unique IPv6 address, so that the device could be visited 
   from outside network easily.  It will be better if these devices 
   could be accessed using domain name other than the tedious IPv6 
   address.
   
   Usually, residential gateway in home network works as a prefix 
   requesting router [RFC3633] to request IPv6 prefix from prefix 
   delegation router and allocate the address to home device using 
   stateless configuration or through an embedded DHCPv6 server. 
   One method to configure the domain suffix in CPEs in large scale is 
   using domain suffix option. 
         
   During DHCP session initiated by residential gateway, domain suffix 
   name (e.g. example.com) could be specified.

   The domain suffix can then be used to update domain name for the 
   hosts in subscriber network, by an embedded DHCPv6 server in 
   residencial gateway or by other means of DNS update mechanism for 
   stateless IPv6 configuration.

Internet-Draft     domain suffix option for DHCPv6         November 2006

   
   To avoid frequent domain name conflicts, aggregation device might 
   allocate different domain suffix name for the CPE. An example way can 
   be selection based on an external authority such as a RADIUS server, 
   in which an unique domain suffix name prefix, called "home name", are
   negotiated between user and ISP when subscribing. For example, 
   "user1.example.com" and "user2.example.com".
