Abstract
   
   The increasing world-wide demands in deep space scientific missions,
   such as Lunar, Mars and other Planetary Exploration, along with the 
   rapidly growing advances in space communication technologies have
   triggered the vision of so called future Deep Space Information
   Networks (DSINs). The coined DSIN paradigm is envisioned to be an
   integrated high speed self-organizing hypernetwork consisting of the
   terrestrial ground-based information networks and the outer space-
   based entities to provide maximum network capacity. In this document,
   the problem of network infrastructure and architecture for DSINs is
   investigated. Taking into account the major challenges or
   characteristics affecting link, networking, transport, and security
   design of DSINs, this document employs hypergraph theory to construct
   network infrastructure and node architecture of space optical
   switching, and further presents a five-layered hypernetwork model of
   DSINs to enhance network connectivity. Combining with the benefits
   in interconnection and interoperability of heterogeneous challenged
   networks, brought by the well-known Delay-and Disruption-Tolerant
   Networking (DTN) architecture, this document proposes a novel
   architecture of DSINs from two levels including Layered Protocol
   Stack and Management Plane. The proposed architecture preliminarily
   achieves the basic concepts and the relevant mechanisms of wisdom
   network, and the performance and quality of service (QoS) of DSINs
   are thereby improved.

1.  Introduction

   With the rapid growth of world-wide demands in deep space scientific 
   missions such as Lunar, Mars and other Planetary Exploration, and the
   recent technological advances in space communications, in-site 
   communications and navigation, spacecraft radio systems, crew 
   transport vehicles, and so on, there has been increasing amount of 
   scientific data to be generated from deep space exploration missions
   to be transmitted back to the Earth [1]. In addition, these missions 
   require high data rates on interplanetary links, e.g., 10 Gb/s of
   NASA's Kepler mission beyond 2020 [2], seamless end-to-end 
   information flow across the solar system and beyond, real time data
   delivery, and integrated communications, navigation, and operations 
   services, and so on [3]. The growing demand for outer space 
   exploration and scientific missions of the future has given rise to
   the vision of next-generation space network infrastructure. One
   prominent next-generation space network infrastructure is the
   InterPlaNetary (IPN) Internet [1], outlined by NASA, an extension 
   of the terrestrial Internet into outer space, focusing on providing
   communication and navigation services for the future deep space 
   missions.

   In light of the above ever-growing requirements, the vision of so
   called future Deep Space Information Networks (DSINs) will be
   gradually formed through the terrestrial communication
   infrastructures, and such large number of nodes in outer space, i.e.,
   satellites, robotic spacecrafts, crewed vehicles, rovers, landers,
   sensors, etc. The coined DSIN paradigm is an integrated high speed
   self-organizing hypernetwork consisting of the terrestrial
   ground-based information networks, e.g., Internet, mobile
   communication networks, and sensor networks, etc, and the space-and
   deep space-based entities, e.g., satellites, robotic spacecrafts,
   crewed vehicles, rovers, landers, sensors, etc, within outer space,
   to provide maximum network capacity. The DSINs are envisioned to
   offer reliable communications for scientific data deliveries between
   Earth and other planets, and also navigation service for outer
   space-based entities of future deep space exploration. 

   The main challenges affect link, networking, transport, and security
   design of DSINs can be summarized as follows [1]-[7]:

   Interconnection of layered heterogeneous networks:    There are
      several different architectures used in DSINs due to the 
      coexistence of several layered distinct network components, e.g.,
      terrestrial Internet, sensor networks, and satellite networks in
      outer space. Therefore, the DSINs can be considered as "network
      of networks" and need to cope with the interconnection of
      heterogeneous networks.

   Intermittent connectivity and frequent partitioning:   Link outage
      may occur for the reasons such as moving planetary bodies, harsh
      natural environment and interference. Moreover, in light of
      economical reasons, radio transceivers for space communications
      are shared, and link connectivity is scheduled to be episodic. The
      network topology may be frequently partitioned due to intermittent
      connectivity of links.

   Long and variable propagation delay:   The deep space links may have
      extremely long propagation delays caused by long transmission
      distances. The movement of deep space nodes adds to the
      variability of delay, and the movement of nodes during propagation
      must be considered while computing the routes or scheduling the
      packet, e.g., one-way propagation delays of the Cassini mission to
      Saturn are in the range of 68 minutes and 84 minutes [6].

   Link bandwidth asymmetry:   The asymmetry in the bandwidth capacities
      of the uplink and downlink channels is typically on the order of
      1:1000 in scientific missions.

   High link error rates:   The bit error rate for deep space links is
      very high (usually in the order of 10-1 [8]) because of harsh
      natural environment and long propagation distances.

   Security:   The spacecraft is operated completely isolated in space
      and only connected to several ground stations or other spacecrafts
      via deep space links. Hence, this property nullifies the
      advantages of asymmetric key management systems for key exchange
      [4]. Moreover, spacecraft on-board computers and processors
      generally have limited computational power and capabilities.
      Therefore, complex cryptographic operations such as asymmetric
      cryptography should be avoided [4].

   Based on the above, most of these characteristics are unique to DSINs
   in contrast to those in terrestrial networks, and especially, there
   are no guaranteed continuous end-to-end paths between sources and
   destinations in DSINs due to the intermittently or partially
   connected dynamic topologies. Thus, the existing TCP/IP protocol
   suite over the Internet can not be efficiently used in DSINs. In
   recent years, the architecture of a class of challenged networks,

   known as the Delay-and Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN)
   architecture [9]-[11] has emerged as a promising solution to
   provide an overlay network for highly challenged networks that
   experience high latency, high error rates, intermittent connectivity,
   frequent partitions, asymmetric data rates, and different
   heterogeneous network architectures. It can be naturally observed
   that the DSIN is a typical scenario of DTN.

   This document studies the issue of network infrastructure and
   architecture of DSINs. Considering the major challenges or
   characteristics affecting link, networking, transport, and security
   design of DSINs, this document uses hypergraph theory to model the
   network infrastructure, in which node architecture of space optical
   switching is applied, and also presents a novel hypernetwork model of
   DSINs in order to enhance network connectivity. Furthermore, this
   document discusses the methods of constructing the hyperchannels in
   hypernetwork model. Based on the benefits of DTN architecture and
   service requirements of future networks, this document proposes a
   novel architecture of DSINs at two levels, i.e., Layered Protocol
   Stack and Management Plane.

2.  Related Work
   
   In this section, the document gives a brief review of related work in
   network infrastructure and architecture of space associated networks
   to propose the ideas of this document for hypernetwork model and
   architecture of DSINs

2.1.  Network Infrastructure

   The general network infrastructure of NASAs space Internet contains
   four architectural elements [1], [12], i.e., backbone network, access
   network, inter-spacecraft network, and proximity network. The authors
   in [1] presented the infrastructure of IPN Internet, which includes
   Interplanetary Backbone Network, Interplanetary External Networks,
   and Planetary Networks. The Interplanetary Backbone Network [1]
   provides a common infrastructure for communications among the Earth,
   outer-space planets, and relay spacecrafts placed at gravitationally
   stable Lagrangian points of planets, etc. The Interplanetary External
   Networks [1] focus inherently on the communications among nodes of
   outer space between planets. The Planetary Networks [1] can be
   further divided into Planetary Satellite Network and Planetary
   Surface Network, aiming to offer communications among satellites and
   surface nodes of single planet. However, the network infrastructure
   of IPN Internet is still a normal partitioning and structure.

   The IP-based communication infrastructure of Global Information Grid
   (GIG) generally includes terrestrial, space based, airborne, and
   wireless or radio segments [13]. With the enabling underlying
   infrastructure for "network-centric" military communications, the
   authors in [14] defined four layers that constitute the
   infrastructure of the GIG, for the purpose of support seamless global
   communications. These four layers can be specifically classified into
   surface layer, aerospace layer, near-space layer, and satellite layer
   in light of bottom-up approach. However, although the satellite layer
   was considered to enhance the overall performance of GIG, the
   benefits brought by deep space networking was not taken into account.

2.2.  Architecture

   Due to the primary challenges introduced by DSINs, conventional
   TCP/IP protocol suite-based network architectures are not applicable
   to the DSIN scenario. Generalized from design work for IPN Internet
   [15], the DTN architecture is a novel store-and-forward architecture
   and protocol suite intended for challenged networks that may suffer
   from frequent partitions and high delays. A store-and-forward message
   switching is implemented within DTN architecture through defining an
   end-to-end message-oriented overlay known as the "bundle layer"
   [16], [17] on top of lower layers of heterogeneous networks. In
   particular, the bundle layer lies between transport layer and
   application layer and forms an overlay that employs persistent
   storage to deal with network interruption [16]. In addition, the
   bundle layer includes a hop-by-hop transfer of reliable delivery
   responsibility and optional end-to-end acknowledgement [16]. For
   interoperability of heterogeneous networks, the bundle layer applies
   a flexible Uniform Resource Identifiers-based naming scheme capable
   of encapsulating distinct naming and addressing schemes in the same
   overall naming syntax [16].

   In order to meet the requirements of future networks, the authors in
   [18] describe the concept of wisdom networks to provide the
   wisdom-based ultimate services for network users. However, for that
   matter, the DTN architecture does not properly define management
   planes to suit service requirements of future networks.

3.  Hypernetwork Model

3.1.  Preliminaries of Hypergraph

   According to Berge's pioneer work [19], a hypergraph H is an ordered
   pair H =(V,E)consisting of a non-empty finite set of vertices
   V ={v1,v2,...,vp}and a set family E ={E1,E2,...,Ep}of distinct
   finite subsets of the sets of vertices V . Each Ej for j = 1,2,...,q
   is called edge of a hypergraph or hyperedge and the union of all Ej
   is V .The size of a hypergraph is the sum of the cardinalities of its
   hyperedges.

3.2.  Hypernetwork Model of DSINs

   In order to enhance network connectivity and resolve existing issues
   in network infrastructures, this document models a DSIN as a
   hypernetwork H =(V,E), in which the non-empty finite set of vertices
   V denotes the nodes of DSIN, and the set family E denotes the
   non-empty finite set of hyperchannels of DSIN. The construction of
   hyperchannels is an open problem, and yet there have been several
   schemes or strategies to build up hyperchannels in the literature,
   such as TDM-based schedule [20], forbidden subsets [21], frequency
   assignment [22], and bundle transport model [23], protein-protein
   interaction network [24] and so on. In this section, from network
   connectivity's point of view, this document preliminarily creates
   the hyperchannels that can provide full connectivity or
   communications among all the nodes within the corresponding
   hyperchannels.

   Based on the above ideas, within a time interval [t0,T], a typical
   structural sample scenario of hypernetwork model of DSIN is
   illustrated in Figure 1. From top to bottom in an orderly way, the
   hypernetwork model can be divided into five layers: a) Planetary
   Exploration Sensor Layer, consisting of planetary exploration nodes;
   b) Deep Space Planetary Layer, consisting of deep space planetary
   spacecraft nodes; c) Deep Space Backbone Layer, consisting of deep
   space backbone spacecraft nodes; d) Space-Based Layer, consisting of
   space-based nodes; and e) Ground-Based Layer, consisting of
   ground-based nodes.

   To better realize high-speed transmission and maximum network
   capacity of DSINs, this document assumes that the state of the art
   space optical switching techniques are employed in both deep space
   backbone spacecraft nodes and deep space planetary spacecraft nodes.
   The node architecture of space optical switching is designed via
   novel hypergraph model for the sake of high-speed data transfer and
   on-board switching. Note that the ground-based layer embraces
   terrestrial heterogeneous networks, e.g., Internet, sensor networks,
   and mobile communication networks, etc, and the space-based layer
   covers various satellite networks.

4.  Architecture

   In this section, the document proposes a novel architecture for DSINs
   As shown in Figure 2, the architecture of DSINs is composed of 
   Layered Protocol Stack and Management Plane.

4.1.  Layered Protocol Stack

   The Layered Protocol Stack is made up of six layers, i.e., Physical
   Layer, Data Hyperlink Layer, Hypernetwork Layer, Transport Layer,
   Bundle Layer, and Application Layer. The Physical Layer, Transport
   Layer, Bundle Layer, and Application Layer are usually considered no
   distinction to those in conventional DTN architecture. In the
   proposed Layered Protocol Stack, this document emphasizes primarily
   on the Hypernetwork Layer and Data Hyperlink Layer, which perform the
   following functions:

   Hypernetwork Layer:   The messages in Hypernetwork Layer are termed
      as hyperdatagrams. In addition, the hyperchannel is bulidt up in
      terms of specific rules or algorithms and the source-to-
      destination hyperpaths or hyperroutes are discovered, repaired,
      and established. 

   Data Hyperlink Layer:   The messages in Data Hyperlink Layer are
      termed as hyperframes. The Data Hyperlink Layer provides the
      functional means to detect hyperframe and possibly correct errors
      that may occur in the Physical Layer. Moreover, the hyperlink-to-
      hyperlink fragmentation of hyperframes into hyperframe pieces and
      reassembly into complete hyperframes are also carried out.

4.2.  Management Plane

   The Management Plane comprises four functional planes, i.e., Mapping
   Plane, Knowledge Plane, Wisdom Plane, and Service Plane. The Mapping
   Plane offers the capability to shield the heterogeneity of various
   underlying networks for the purpose of logical coexistence and
   resource sharing among diverse heterogeneous networks. In addition,
   the Service Plane performs schedule and quality of service (QoS)
   management of services based on the process of abstracting. In this
   section, the document introduces the following definitions to explain
   the coined Knowledge Plane and Wisdom Plane.

   The Knowledge Cycle of DSINs -  It is defined as a feasible closed
      flow based on DSIN infrastructure to acquire, store, share, and
      process knowledge.

   As depicted in Figure 3, the Knowledge Cycle contains four logical
   steps, namely, Knowledge Acquisition, Knowledge Storage, Knowledge
   Sharing, and Knowledge Processing.

                Figure 3. The Knowledge Cycle of DSINs

   The Knowledge Plane - It is a logical function entity to implement
      Knowledge Acquisition, Knowledge Storage, Knowledge Sharing, and
      Knowledge Processing in each layer within the Layered Protocol
      Stack by the Knowledge Cycle of DSINs.
 
   The Wisdom Chain of DSINs - It is defined as a feasible open flow to
      transform Data, Information, and Knowledge to Wisdom by the means
      of Analysis, Imagination and Game.
   As illustrated in Figure 4, the Wisdom is generated through
   competition or interactive decision making of each layer within the
   Layered Protocol Stack in the Wisdom Chain of DSINs. Note that the
   competition inherently indicates a multi-player dynamic game. Thus,
   this document models the transformation from Knowledge to Wisdom
   using stochastic differential game [25].

5.  Conclusions and Future Work

   In this document, we have investigated the issue of network
   infrastructure and architecture of DSINs. Considering the major
   challenges or characteristics affecting link, networking and
   transport design of DSINs, we apply the so called hypergraph theory
   to study the network infrastructure and node architecture of space
   optical switching, and present a hypernetwork model of DSINs for the
   purpose of enhancing network connectivity. In addition, this document
   explores the schemes to build up the hyperchannels of hypernetwork
   model. According to the benefits of store-and-forward DTN
   architecture and service requirements of future networks, this
   document proposes a novel architecture of DSINs at two levels, i.e.,
   Layered Protocol Stack and Management Plane, to provide the
   wisdom-based ultimate services for network nodes. Therefore, the
   vision of wisdom network has been preliminarily realized.

   This document provides the fundamental framework for network 
   infrastructure and architecture of DSINs. As a part of future work,
   we will aim to research on the specific schemes of constructing the
   efficient hyperchannels through different strategies. As another
   future work, we will build up the hyperrouting model and node
   architecture in DSINs.

6.  Security Considerations

   Security is an integral concern for the design of the Architecture of
   Deep Space Information Networks (DSINs), but its use is optional.
   Sections 1 of this document present some factors to consider for
   securing the design of DSINs, but separate documents [4] and [7]
   provide the security schemes in much more detail.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.
