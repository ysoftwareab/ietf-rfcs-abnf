Abstract 
    
   One of the biggest challenges faced by GMPLS technology is ôhow it 
   can be deployedö in a manner least impacting to existing IP/ MPLS 
   networks. GMPLS architecture document lists [RFC3945] three different 
   scenarios in which GMPLS technology can be deployed: overlay, 
   augmented and integrated. Reference [GMPLS-mig] addresses the problem 
   of migration from MPLS to GMPLS networks using the integrated model. 
   This draft addresses the same problem space for augmented model and 
   illustrates the applicability of augmented model in deploying GMPLS 
   technology in existing IP/ MPLS networks.

1. Introduction 
 
   One of the biggest challenges in todayÆs network is ôhow to deploy 
   GMPLS technologyö in a manner least impact on the existing IP/ MPLS 
   networks. It is neither feasible nor desired to upgrade all existing 
   nodes to GMPLS technology. In fact, it is required to minimize the 
   impact of migration to GMPLS on the existing IP/ MPLS network. It is 
   also desired to respect the administrative boundaries between IP/MPLS 
   and Optical domains.  
    
   There are several architectural alternatives including overlay, 
   integrated and augmented models proposed in GMPLS architecture 
   document [RFC3945]. The key difference among these models is how much 
   and what kind of network information can be shared between packet and 
   Optical domains. Peer model is suitable, where optical transport and 
   Internet/Intranet Service networks are operated by a single entity. 
   Currently, many service providers have traditionally built their 
   networks, where Optical transport and IP/MPLS service networks belong 
   to different operation/management/ownership. Most important thing is 
   that service providers wants to operate and manage their networks 
   independently, and deploy them without changing existing IP/MPLS 
   network topologies, protocols and scalability. Overlay model is 
   suitable for such scenario, however does not offer the benefits of 
   peer model approach for efficient resource utilization, optimal 
   routing and protection and restoration between IP/MPLS and Optical 
   networks. Augmented model is suitable in this scenario, where Optical 
   transport and IP/MPLS service networks administrated by different 
   entities and would like to maintain a separation between IP/MPLS and 
   Optical layers, at the same time, get the benefits of integrated 
   model approach.

   Reference [GMPLS-mig] addresses the problem of migration from MPLS to 
   GMPLS networks using the integrated model. This draft addresses the 
   GMPLS deployment considerations using augmented model and illustrates 
   how it can be used in existing IP, MPLS and non-IP/MPLS networks. In 
   this regard, there are three different considerations taken into 
   account while comparing these approaches. They are: Deployment 
   considerations, routing aspects, and failure recovery considerations.  
    
2. Augmented Model 
 
   Augmented Model is introduced in GMPLS Architecture document 
   [RFC3945]. It is a hybrid model between the full peer and overlay 
   models. Border nodes at the edge of IP/MPLS domain and optical domain 
   receive routing information from the optical devices (in optical 
   domain) and nodes (in IP/MPLS domain). Based on this information, 
   border node keeps the optical and IP/MPLS routing domain topology 
   information in separate topology database. No routing information 
   from the router region is carried into the optical region and vice 
   versa.

2.1   Routing in Augmented Model 
    
   Augmented model maintains a separation between optical and routing 
   topologies; unlike integrated model approach, where topology 
   information is shared between IP/MPLS and Optical domains. 
   Nonetheless, as the border node has full knowledge of the optical 
   network, it can compute routes for GMPLS LSPs within the optical 
   domain. This allows augmented model to be more efficient in resource 
   utilization than overlay model, such that router and optical domain 
   resource can be optimized. At the same time, it can yield more 
   efficient use of resources, similar to the full peer model.  
 
2.2   Failure Recovery in Augmented Model 
 
   Both integrated model and augmented model offer a tighter 
   coordination between IP/MPLS and optical layers, which helps to 
   resolve uncorrelated failures. This is unlike overlay model, which 
   offers no coordination between optical and IP/MPLS layers; 
 
 
Z. Ali, et al.                  Page 4                       2/14/2005
                                    
[Page 4] 
    draft-ali-ccamp-gmpls-deployment-augmented-model-00.txt    Feb. 2005 
 
 
   consequently a single failure in one layer may trigger uncorrelated 
   failures in the other domain, which may complicate the fault 
   handling.  
    
   Another important aspect in augmented model is failure transparency, 
   i.e., a failure in optical network does not affect operations at 
   router network and vice versa. Specifically, failure in the optical 
   domain does not affect services in routing (IP/MPLS) domain, and 
   failure can be restored/ repaired in optical domain without impacting 
   IP/MPLS domain and vice versa. Where as in peer model, since optical 
   and IP/MPLS domains share the same topology and routing information, 
   failure in optical domain is visible to IP/MPLS domain and vice 
   versa.  
    
2.3  Management in Augmented model 
    
   Currently, many service providers have traditionally built their 
   networks, where Optical transport and IP/MPLS service networks belong 
   to different operation/management/ownership. In augmented model, each 
   network administrator can operate and manage his network 
   independently because this model maintains a complete separation 
   between these networks. 
    
 
3. GMPLS Deployment Considerations 
    
   In the integrated model, since all the devices in optical and routing 
   domains share the same topology and routing information with same IGP 
   instance, it requires all the devices within peer model to be 
   MPLS/GMPLS aware. Reference [GMPLS-mig] discusses various aspects of 
   migration from MPLS to GMPLS technology using integrated model.  
    
   In augmented model, as shown in figure 1, devices within optical and 
   its routing domains have no visibility into others topology and/or 
   routing information, except the border nodes. This will help 
   augmented model to accommodate both MPLS based or non-MPLS based 
   service networks connected to border nodes, as long as Border node in 
   augmented model can support GMPLS control plane.  
    
   One of the main advantages of the augmented model in the context of 
   GMPLS deployability is that it does not require existing IP/ MPLS 
   networks to be GMPLS aware. Only border nodes need to be upgraded 
   with the GMPLS functionality. In this fashion, augmented model 
   renders itself for incremental deployment of the optical regions, 
   without requiring reconfiguration of existing areas/ASes, changing 
   operation of IGP and EGP or software upgrade of the existing IP/MPLS 
   service networks.

3.1   Applicability of virtual FA-LSP 
 
   Virtual FA-LSPs discussed in [GMPLS-mig] are equally applicable to 
   the integrated and augmented models. Specifically, in augmented 
   model, the border node can advertise virtual GMPLS FA-LSPs into 
   IP/MPLS network and can establish the LSP statically or dynamically 
   on as needed basis.  
    
3.2   Applicability of FA Utilization 
 
   There are several possible schemes for determining how many FAs to 
   provision, when to enable the FAs, and whether to choose FAs of 
   virtual FAs as discussed in [GMPLS-mig] for integrated model. These 
   aspects of FA Utilization are equally applicable to augmented model, 
   with intelligence of FA Utilization implemented at the border node. 
    
4.3 Bundling FA-LSP 
    
   In augmented model, it is also possible to bundle GMPLS FA-LSPs at 
   the border nodes. Since IP/ MPLS network will only see a bundled link 
   with TE or IGP attributes, operations on the bundled link, e.g., 
   adding a new component link, failure of a component link, etc., are 
   completely transparent to the rest of the network.
