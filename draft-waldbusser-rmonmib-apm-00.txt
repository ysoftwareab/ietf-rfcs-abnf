Internet Draft              APM MIB             March 10, 2000


1.  Abstract

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
(MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-
based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for
measuring the application performance as experienced by end-
users.

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five
   major components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and
        events for the purpose of management. The first
        version of this Structure of Management Information
        (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC
        1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58,
        RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management
        information. The first version of the SNMP message
        protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC
        1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC
        1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management
        information. The first set of protocol operations and
        associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC
        1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations and
        associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC
        2573 [14] and the view-based access control mechanism
        described in RFC 2575 [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [22].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
   in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the
   SMIv2. A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced
   through the appropriate translations. The resulting
   translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except
   where objects or events are omitted because no translation
   is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
   However, this loss of machine readable information is not
   considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

3.  Overview

This document continues the architecture created in the RMON
MIB [18] by providing analysis of application performance as
experienced by end-users.

Application performance measurement measures the quality of
service delivered to end-users by applications. With this
perspective, a true end-to-end view of the IT infrastrure
results, combining the performance of the application,
desktop, network, and server, as well as any positive or
negative interactions between these components.

Despite all the technically sophisticated ways in which
networking and system resources can be measured, human end-
users perceive only two things about an application:
availability and responsiveness.

   Availability - The percentage of the time that the
   application is ready to give a user service.

   Responsiveness - The speed at which the application
   delivers the requested service.

A transaction is an action initiated by a user that starts and
completes a distributed processing function. A transaction
begins when a user initiates a request for service (i.e.
pushing a submit button) and ends when the work is completed
(i.e. information is provided or a confirmation is delivered).
A transaction is the fundamental unit measured by the APM MIB.

Application protocols implement one of three different types
of transactions: transaction-oriented, throughput-oriented, or
streaming-oriented. While the availability metric is the same
for all three types, the responsiveness metric varies:

   Transaction-Oriented: These transactions have a fairly
   constant workload to perform for all transactions. The
   responsiveness metric for transaction-oriented protocols is
   application response time (from first request to final
   delivery of service) and is measured in tenth's of seconds.
   This is commonly referred to as end-user response time.

   Throughput-Oriented: These transaction have widely varying
   workloads based on the nature of the client request. In





Steven Waldbusser Expires September 10, 2000          [Page 4]






Internet Draft              APM MIB             March 10, 2000


   particular, throughput-oriented protocols vary widely in
   the amount of data that must be transported to satisfy the
   request. The responsiveness metric for throughput-oriented
   protocols is seconds per terabit. [Ref: 2Kbps= 500 Million,
   1Gbps=1000].  The inverting of the popular bits per second
   is done so that for all responsiveness metrics, lower
   values are better.

   Streaming-Oriented: These transactions deliver data at a
   constant metered rate of speed regardless of the
   responsiveness of the networking and computing
   infrastructure. This constant rate of speed is generally
   spec'ed to be below (sometimes well below) the nominal
   capability of the infrastructure. However, when the
   infrastructure's cannot deliver data at this speed,
   interruption of service or degradation of service can
   result. The responsiveness metric for streaming-oriented
   protocols is the ratio of time that the service is degraded
   or interrupted to the total service time. This metric is
   measured in parts per million.


3.1.  Report Aggregation

This MIB provides functions to aggregate measurements into
higher level summaries.

Every transaction is identified by its protocol, server, and
client and has an availability measure as well as a
responsiveness measure. The appropriate responsiveness measure
is context-sensitive depending on whether the protocol is
transaction-oriented, throughput-oriented, or streaming-
oriented. For example, in a 5 minute period several
transactions might be recorded:

Protocol  Client  Server   Successful    Responsiveness
HTTP      Jim     Amazon   1             6 sec.
SAP/R3    Jane    SAP      1             17 sec.
HTTP      Joe     HR       0             -
FTP       Jim     ietf     1             212 Kbps
HTTP      Joe     HR       1             25 sec.
RealVideo Joe     CNN      1             100.0%
HTTP      Jane    HR       1             5 sec.

These transactions can be aggregated in several ways,





Steven Waldbusser Expires September 10, 2000          [Page 5]






Internet Draft              APM MIB             March 10, 2000


providing statistical summaries - for example summarizing all
HTTP transactions, or all HTTP transactions to the HR Server.
Note that data from different protocols may not be summarized
because:

   1. The performance characteristics of different protocols
   differ widely enough to render statistical analysis
   meaningless.

   2. The responsiveness metrics of different protocols may be
   different, making a statistical analysis impossible.

Aggregating transactions collected over a period requires
aggregation algorithms. Several are provided:

TransactionCount
    The total number of transactions during this period

SuccessfulTransactions
    The total number of transactions that were successful

ResponsivenessMean
    The average of the responsiveness metric for all aggregated
    transactions that completed successfully

ResponsivenessMin
    The minimum responsiveness metric for all aggregated transactions
    that completed successfully

ResponsivenessMax
    The maximum responsiveness metric for all aggregated transactions
    that completed successfully

ResponsivenessBx
    The count of successful transactions whose responsiveness metric
    fell into the range specified for Bx. There are 7 buckets
    specified. Because the performance of different protocols varies
    widely, the bucket ranges are specified separately for each
    protocol (in the protocolDirExtTable) so that they may be tuned to
    typical performance of each protocol.

For example, when aggregating the previous set of transactions
by protocol we get (for simplicity the example only shows
TransactionCount, SuccessfulTransactions, and
ResponsivenessMean):

Internet Draft              APM MIB             March 10, 2000


Protocol  Count Successful      ResponsivenessMean
HTTP      4     3               12 sec.
SAP/R3    1     1               17 sec.
FTP       1     1               212 Kbps.
RealVideo 1     1               100.0%

There are four different types of aggregation.

   The flows(1) aggregation is the simplest. All transactions
   that share common protocol/server/client 3-tuples are
   aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for all
   such unique 3-tuples.

   The clients(2) aggregation results in somewhat more
   aggregation (i.e. fewer resulting records). All
   transactions that share common protocol/client tuples are
   aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for all
   such unique tuples.

   The servers(3) aggregation usually results in still more
   aggregation (i.e. fewer resulting records). All
   transactions that share common protocol/server tuples are
   aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for all
   such unique tuples.

   The protocols(4) aggregation results in the most
   aggregation (i.e. the fewest resulting records). All
   transactions that share a common protocol are aggregated
   together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique
   protocols.


3.2.  Structure of MIB

The objects are arranged into the following groups:

        - Protocol Directory Extensions Group

        - APM Report Group

These groups are the basic unit of conformance.  If an agent
implements a group, then it must implement all objects in that
group. While this section provides an overview of grouping and
conformance information for this MIB, the authoritative
reference for such information is contained in the MODULE-

Internet Draft              APM MIB             March 10, 2000


COMPLIANCE and OBJECT-GROUP macros later in this MIB.

These groups are defined to provide a means of assigning
object identifiers, and to provide a method for implementors
of managed agents to know which objects they must implement.

3.2.1.  The Protocol Directory Extensions Group

The RMON2 protocol directory represents a useful registration
mechanism for network protocols of all layers. For application
protocols measured with this MIB, this group contains the
additional configuration objects required. This group consists
of the protocolDirExtTable.

3.2.2.  The APM Report Group

The APM Report Group is used to prepare regular reports that
aggregate application performance by flow, by client, by
server, or by protocol. This group consists of the
apmReportControlTable and the apmReportTable.

    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The type of aggregation being performed for this set of
        reports.

        The metrics for a single transaction are the responsiveness of
        the transaction and whether the transaction succeeded (a
        boolean). When such metrics are aggregated in this MIB, these
        metrics are replaced by averages and distributions of
        responsiveness and availability. The metrics describing
        aggregates are constant no matter which type of aggregation is
        being performed. These metrics may be found in the
        apmReportTable.

        The flows(1) aggregation is the simplest. All transactions
        that share common protocol/server/client 3-tuples are
        aggregated together, resulting in a set of metrics for all
        such unique 3-tuples.

Internet Draft              APM MIB             March 10, 2000


        The clients(2) aggregation results in somewhat more
        aggregation (i.e. fewer resulting records). All transactions
        that share common protocol/client tuples are aggregated
        together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique
        tuples.

        The servers(3) aggregation usually results in still more
        aggregation (i.e. fewer resulting records). All transactions
        that share common protocol/server tuples are aggregated
        together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique
        tuples.

        The protocols(4) aggregation results in the most
        aggregation (i.e. the fewest resulting records). All
        transactions that share a common protocol are aggregated
        together, resulting in a set of metrics for all such unique
        protocols.

        Note that it is not meaningful to aggregate protocols, as
        different protocols have widely varying characteristics. As a
        result, this set of aggregations is complete.

5.  Security Considerations

This MIB contains network addresses, protocol usage
information, and conversation statistics. Data of this nature
may be considered sensitive in some environments. In such
environments the administrator may wish to restrict SNMP
access to the agent.

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
create.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or
vulnerable in some network environments.  The support for SET
operations in a non-secure environment without proper
protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the
network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even
then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,
the use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the
View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the
SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is
properly configured to give access to the objects only to
those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed
GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
