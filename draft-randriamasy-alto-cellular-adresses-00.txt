              draft-randriamasy-alto-cellular-adresses-00

Abstract

   This draft proposes to use the cellular address format composed of
   elements as specified by 3GPP and called ECGI.  ECGI stands for
   E-UTRAN Cell Global Identifier and is used in Public Land Mobile
   Networks based on E-UTRAN.

1.  Introduction

   Cellular networks are present in a number of use cases investigated
   in the ALTO WG and it is useful to specify a format for Cellular
   addresses.  In these cases, Endpoints, PIDs and entities may be
   cells.  In order to specify services such as Network Maps, Cost Maps,
   Endpoint property or Property Maps, it is necessary to order to
   specify an ALTO format for Cell addresses.

   For the sake of efficiency, a preferred option is to use the cell
   identifier format as specified by 3GPP [TS 36.300] and called ECGI,
   as already proposed in [draft-rauschenbach-alto-wireless-access-00]
   and in other discussions.  ECGI stands for E-UTRAN Cell Global
   Identifier and is used in Public Land Mobile Networks based on
   E-UTRAN, see [TS 36.331].

   The purpose of this document is to be completed by the ALTO WG and in
   particular:

   - Amend and finalize the specification for the ALTO Cell identifier
   format proposed in the present version,

   - define a placeholder for this specification and identify impacted
   documents.

2.  Relevant ALTO services and documents

   Particular services and drafts where an ALTO address type for
   cellular networks is needed include:

   - Endpoint property service: extended to allow endpoints to be cells
   on which properties can be requested,

   - (Filtered) Cost Map Service: where PIDs can be cells within and
   among which cost values can be requested, see also[draft-randriamasy-
   alto-cost-context-01],

   - "Mobility Network Models in ALTO" defined in [draft-bertz-alto-
   mobilitynets] propose to identify network points of attachment (PoA)
   such as cells to PIDs.

   - "ALTO Performance Cost Metrics": being defined in [draft-ietf-alto-
   performance-metrics-01], they will be extended to performance costs
   in cellular networks,

   - "Extensible Property Maps for the ALTO Protocol", being defined in
   [draft-roome-alto-unified-props-new-00] will cover entities that may
   be cells which are identified by their addresses.  In this document a
   domain identifier for cells will need to be accordingly defined, and
   the entity domain identifier "ecgi" is proposed.

3.  Proposed format for ALTO cell identifiers

   The predent draft proposed the following specification

3.1.  ALTO address type for cellular networks

   ECGI -- E-UTRAN Cell Global Identifier

3.2.  Endpoint address canonical string format

   'ecgi:' MCC '.' MNC ':' ECI

   Where:

   o  MCC: Mobile Country Code, as assigned by ITU.  A 3 digits decimal
      number without leading zeros.

   o  MNC: Mobile Network Code, as assigned by National Authority.  A
      2-3 digits decimal number without leading zeros.

   o  ECI: E-UTRAN Cell Identifier.  A 7 digits lower-case hex number.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title                  June 2017


   Examples:

   o  ecgi:311.481:1234abc

   o  MNC value 20 stands for Network N1 in France and other networks in
      other countries

   o  MNC value 020 stands for Network N2 in Argentina and other
      networks in other countries

3.3.  ALTO Cell Id formats

   Three formats are proposed:

   o  'ecgi:' MCC

   o  'ecgi': MCC '.'  MNC

   o  'ecgi:' MCC '.'  MNC ':' ECI-MASK '/' MASK-LEN

   where:
        MASK-LEN is a decimal number.
        ECI-MASK is a string of lower-case hex digits, of which
                 all but the first MASK-LEN bits are zero.

   Prefix ecgi:P-MCC.P-MNC:P-ECI/N matches ecgi:MCC.MNC:ECI iff
        MCC == P-MCC, and
        MNC == P-MNC, and
        ECI has the same number of hex digits as P-ECI, and
        the first N bits of ECI match those of P-ECI.

3.4.  Examples

   o  ecgi:311

      *  Matches every cell address with MCC 311.

   o  ecgi:311.481

      *  Matches every cell address with MCC 311 and MNC 481.

   o  ecgi:311.481:1234800/18

      *  Matches every cell address with MCC 311 , MNC 481, and a
         7-digit ECI that starts with the 18 bits 0x12348.  Thus it
         matches ecgi:311.481:1234abc and ecgi:311.481:123480, but does
         not match ecgi:311.481:12348d.
