1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

    For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
    Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
    RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

    Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
    the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
    accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

    Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
    Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
    module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
    RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
    [RFC2580].


2.  Overview

2.1 The Mobile IPv6 Protocol entities.

    Mobile IPv6 (mipv6) [MIPv6] specifies a protocol which allows nodes
    to remain reachable while moving around in the IPv6 Internet. An
    entity which implements the mipv6 protocol is an mipv6 entity. There
    are three types of entities envisaged by the mipv6 protocol.

       mobile node (MN): A node that can change its point of attachment
       from one link to another, while still being reachable via its home
       address.

       correspondent node (CN): A peer node with which a mobile node is
       communicating. The correspondent node may be either mobile or
       stationary. [Note that a corespondent node does not necessarily
       require mipv6 support.]

       home agent (HA): A router on a mobile node's home link with which
       the mobile node has registered its current care-of address. While
       the mobile node is away from home, the home agent intercepts
       packets on the home link destined to the mobile node's home address,
       ecapsulates them, and tunnels them to the mobile node's registered
       care-of address.

    This document defines the managed objects that will be required to
    monitor and control mipv6 entities.

2.2 Terminology.
    The terminolgy used in this document is consistent with the
    definitions used in Mobile IPv6 protocol specification[MIPv6].

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
    [RFC2119].



3.  Mobile IPv6 Monitoring and Control Requirements

    For managing an MIPv6 entity it is necessary to monitor
    the following
        o capabilities of MIPv6 entities
        o traffic due to MIPv6
        o binding related statistics (at HA, CN, MN )
        o binding details (at HA, CN)
        o history of binding updates (at HA, CN, MN)

    The MIPv6 protocol document stipulates that several MIPv6 related
    parameters should be manually configurable. The MIPv6 MIB should
    define managed objects that can be used to configure the related
    parameters.

4.  MIB Design.

    The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as  possible
    and at the same time to make it effective enough so that the
    essential needs of monitoring and control are met. It is envisaged
    that wherever possible existing MIBS will be used (e.g. IPSec MIB,
    Neighbour Discovery MIB, Tunnel MIB..) for monitor and control of
    MIPv6 entities.

    The MIPv6MIB comprises of following sets of groups
        - mipv6IP: a generic group containing objects that are common
          to all the mobile IPv6  entities.
        - mipv6HA: this group models the Home Agent service. It
          comprises of objects specific to the services and associated
          advertisement parameters offerred by the Home Agent on each
          of its links It also contains objects pertaining to the
          maintenance of the Home Agent list on each of the links on
          which the service is offered.
        - mipv6MN: this group models the Mobile Node service. It
          comprises of objects specific to the Dynamic Home Agent
          discovery function and related parameters. It also contains
          objects that record the movement of the mobile node.
        - mipv6CN: models the Correspondent Node and is primarily
          scoped to its participation in the Return Routability
          procedure for achieving
          Route Optimization triggered by the mobile node.
        - mipv6Notifications: defines the set of notifications that
          will be used to asynchronously monitor the mobile IPv6
          entities.

    The tables contained in the above groups are as follows-
        mipv6IPBindingCacheTable   : contains  the BindingCache.
        mipv6IPBindingHistoryTable : the history of the Bindings.
        mipv6NodeTrafficTable      : the mobile node-wise traffic
                                     counters.
        mnBLTable         : contains information about the
                                     registration requests sent by the
                                     mobile node and the corresponding
                                     results.
        cnCounterTable             : contains the mobile node-wise
                                     registration statistics.
        haAdvConfTable             : contains the configurable
                                     advertisement parameters for all
                                     the interfaces on which the which
                                     the home agent service is
                                     advertised.
        haCounterTable             : contains registration statistics
                                     for all mobile nodes registered

        haListTable                : contains the list of all routers
                                     that are acting as home agents on
                                     each of the interfaces on which
                                     the home agent service is offered

Security Considerations

    There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
    with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
    objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
    environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
    environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
    network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
    sensitivity/vulnerability:
         mipv6Enable: This value of this object is used to enable or
                      disable the mipv6 functionality on a mipv6 entity.
                      Access to this MO may be abused to disrupt the
                      mipv6 communication.
         haAdvLifetime: Access to this object may be abused to set the
                      advertised lifetime to incorrect values. That will
                      have an adverse impact on the mipv6 communication.
         haAdvPreference: Access to this object may be abused to force
                      MNs into selecting the wrong HA.
    Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
    MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
    vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
    control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
    to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
    the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
    sensitivity/vulnerability:

     The address related objects in this MIB may be considered to be
     particularly sensitive and/or private.  The care of address related
     objects reveal the location and movement of the mobile node. This
     information may be considered to be private and sensitive and must
     be carefully handled.
         mipv6BindingHstCOAType
         mipv6BindingHstCOA
         mnBLCOAType
         mnBLCOA

     The mobile node's home address and home agent related information
     may be considered to be sensitive too as these may provide clues to
     a malicious party on ways to disrupt the mobile nodes communication
     channels.
         mipv6BindingHstHomeAddressType,
         mipv6BindingHstHomeAddress,
         mnHomeAddressType,
         mnHomeAddress

     The Correspondent node's addresses related MOs will reveal the nodes
     with whom the MN is corresponding. This information may be
     considered private and sensitive.

         mnBLNodeAddress


    SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
    Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
    even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
    allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
    in this MIB module.

    It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
    provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
    including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
    authentication and privacy).

    Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
    RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
    enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
    responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
    instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
    the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
    rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
