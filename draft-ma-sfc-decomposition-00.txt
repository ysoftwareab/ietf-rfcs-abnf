1.  Introduction

   Service function chaining (SFC), as defined in the SFC Problem
   Statement [I-D.quinn-sfc-problem-statement], affects "packets and/or
   frames selected as a result of classification.  Packet and/or frame-
   based classification, however, is limited to information that is
   available in every packet and/or frame.  Typical methods of using
   VLAN tags or TCP(UDP)/IP 5-tuples (i.e., source IP address,
   destination IP address, IP protocol, source port, and destination
   port) allow frame/packet flows to be easily identified and directed
   through an appropriate service function (SF) or chain.  The service
   functions themselves, however, are often more complex and act upon
   higher level message constructs (e.g., HTTP/1.x messages or chunks
   [RFC2616], or HTTP/2.x frames [I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2]) whose
   boundaries do not typically align with L2/3 frame/packet boundaries.
   Particularly in the cases of application acceleration, deep packet
   inspection (DPI), server load balancing (SLB), anti-virus scanning,
   and various HTTP-based protocol optimizations (e.g., HTTP live
   streaming (HLS) [I-D.pantos-http-live-streaming] video delivery), the
   limitations of frame/packet-based classification necessitate flow
   termination and re-classification, in order to perform the service
   function.  Given the overhead cost of flow termination and re-
   classification, multiple service functions are often merged into a
   single monolithic service function (or composite service function) to
   take advantage of economies of scale.

   Basic service function chaining allows multiple composite service
   functions (perhaps provided by different vendors) to be ordered and
   routed through, however, duplication of message-level re-
   classification is likely.  There may also be duplication of component
   service functions by the independent composite service functions.
   Decomposition of the composite service functions could reduce the
   overhead that results from duplicated processing and provide more
   granular control over virtualized service functions.  Decomposition
   also enables component function isolation which is useful for
   virtualization and scaling.

   This document describes the challenges associated with composite
   service function decomposition and the requirements for supporting
   service function chaining with component services.  The document uses
   an HLS video session to illustrate the decomposition concepts, but it
   should be understood that service function decomposition is
   applicable to a wide variety of application layer services.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in the SFC Problem
   Statement [I-D.quinn-sfc-problem-statement].  Additional terminology
   is defined below:

   o  Composite Service Function: A service function that consumes a
      frame/packet flow, but is made up of multiple component service
      functions that act on message flows.

   o  Component Service Function: A service function that may be
      separated out from a composite service function.

   o  Decomposed Service Function Chain: A service function chain
      composed of component service functions, which begins and ends at
      a composite service function endpoint.

   o  Split Chain: A service function chain with multiple paths between
      two component service functions, consisting of different component
      service functions.

   o  Demux Service Function: A service function which performs stateful
      classification, separating incoming flow data, selecting different
      service function paths for different subsets of the flow data,
      with the understanding that the processed flow data must be
      reassembled at a further downstream service function.

   o  Remux Service Function: A service function which recombines
      incoming flow data arriving from different service function paths,
      previously separated by an upstream demux service function.

2.  Service Function Decomposition

   The following sections describe the use case, challenges, and
   solution requirements for decomposed service function chaining.

2.1.  HLS Use Case

   In an HLS live streaming session, the client polls a sliding window
   manifest file which indicates the most recent MPEG-TS segment files
   available for retrieval.  An HLS video optimization service function
   may perform CDN selection, request routing (RR), and/or SLB, as well
   as perform URL and HTTP header rewrite on both the manifest and
   segment requests.  For manifest responses, manifest manipulation may
   be used to perform ad insertion, rate limiting, or other user
   entitlement enforcement services.  For segment responses, segment
   manipulation may be used to perform internationalization (i.e.,
   alternate audio and/or subtitles), rate limiting, watermarking, etc.
   service.  Each of these service functions are applied at an
   application messaging layer, not at a L2/3 frame/packet layer.

   In a secure session, manifest requests are protected by TLS (i.e.,
   using HTTPS), while segment requests may not be if the segment files
   themselves are already encrypted.  Manifest and segment requests do
   not typically use persistent HTTP/1.x connections but could.  HTTP/
   2.0 muxed streams with server push could also be used.  These each
   pose different issues for composite service function decomposition,
   as described below:

   o  HTTP/1.x (non-persistent): The different non-persistent connection
      flows (identified by TCP/IP 5-tuple) still need to be associated
      in order to apply user entitlements and to collect session
      analytics.  Manifest requests may also require TLS termination.

   o  HTTP/1.x (persistent): The requests for manifests and segments
      occur over the same persistent connection flow (identified by TCP/
      IP 5-tuple) have different processing requirements for request
      routing and content transformation.

   o  HTTP/2.0 (muxed): In addition to the separate processing
      requirements for request routing and content transformation, the
      interleaving of data frames for manifest and segment responses
      travelling over the same persistent connection flow (identified by
      TCP/IP 5-tuple) must be re-associated in real-time.

   o  HTTP/2.0 (server push): With server push, there is no longer a
      one-to-one correlation between request and response file which
      complicates reverse path mapping for bi-directional flows.

Internet-Draft              SFC Decomposition              February 2014


   For an HLS video optimization service to be decomposed, the
   individual packets associated with each message need to be identified
   and marked in a way that frame/packet-based SFC-aware devices can
   (and will) use to forward the frames/packets to the next component
   service function in the chain.

2.2.  Composite Service Function

   Using the most interesting case of HTTP/2.0 over TLS, with manifests
   and segments muxed on the same TCP connection and using server push,
   we can create a bidirectional composite service function as shown in
   the figures below.

           |                                   |
           | packets from client               | from previous in chain
           V                                   V
     +------------+           +----------------------------------+
     | classifier |           |  Opaque composite service       |
     +------------+           |  - front-end TLS termination     |
         |   |                |  - Subscriber Entitlement lookup |
         |   +--------------->|  - CDN Request Routing/SLB       |
         |     n-tuple match  |  - HTTP header rewrite           |
         |                    |  - HTTP URL rewrite              |
         |                    |  - back-end TLS termination      |
         |                    +----------------------------------+
         |                                     |
         | no match                            | packets to server
         | (alternate chain)                   | (to next in chain)
         V                                     V

   The ingress path (classified using a 3 or 5-tuple match on the front-
   end TLS connection) terminates TLS, extracts user credentials, looks
   up subscriber information, enforces subscriber entitlements, performs
   RR/SLB, updates the URL and request headers then forwards the request
   to the server, along the chain, over TLS.

           V                                   V

         |                    |  - front-end TLS termination     |
         |                    +----------------------------------+
         |                                     |
         | no match                            | packets to client
         | (alternate chain)                   | (to next in chain)
         V                                     V

   The egress path (classified using a 5-tuple match on the back-end TLS
   connection) receives content on the TLS connection it initiated,
   reconstructs the manifest/segment file, looks up subscriber
   information, enforces subscriber entitlements, and depending on the
   type of file, performs manifest/segment manipulation and records
   session analytics, then forwards the request to the client (along the
   chain), over the original TLS connection.

2.3.  Non-SFC Service Decomposition

   Service decomposition could be accomplished without SFC, using the
   traditional means of either VLAN stitching or statically configured
   next hop IP addresses.  These methods suffer from all the limitations
   described in the SFC Problem Statement
   [I-D.quinn-sfc-problem-statement] document.  An example decomposition
   is shown in the figures below.

                                               V

   The ingress path is divided into three independent component service
   functions, splitting out the front-end and back-end TLS processing
   which is not HLS video delivery specific and may be commoditized.
   (The two TLS processing service functions may actually be two
   separate instantiations of the same service.)  The subscriber
   entitlement enforcement, RR/SLB, and URL/headers updates are
   performed by a separate independent service function.

Internet-Draft              SFC Decomposition              February 2014


   The egress path is divided into four independent component service
   functions, splitting out the front-end and back-end TLS processing
   (identical to the ingress path, just in reverse order) as well as
   separating manifest and segment manipulation functions, given the
   different resource requirements associated with each function.

   Note: The HTTP response demux could be separated out from the back-
   end TLS service function, however, they are left combined in this
   example for simplicity.  The key point is that demuxing from a single
   TCP session occurs and the traffic is split between more than one
   downstream path.

   It should be noted that after each of the independent service
   functions, re-classification is required.  In the case of the two TLS
   SFs, TCP termination is required in order to terminate the front-end
   and back-end TLS sessions.  In the case of the RR/SLB SF, though TCP
   termination is not explicitly required to deal with the differences
   that result from content rewrite, the decision as to whether or not
   back-end TLS is required relies on message-level processing and
   cannot be determined by the frame/packet-based classifier.  Given
   these considerations, the sequence of SFs 1, 2, and 3 cannot be
   assembled into an single service function chain.  Instead, each of
   the three hops in the path must be evaluated as independent service
   function chains, each composed of a single SF.

   Similar to the ingress RR/SLB case, the return path manifest and
   segment processing requires message-level parsing to determine the
   next hop service function.  This cannot be accomplished by the frame/
   packet-based classifier.  Unique to the egress case, in this example,
   are the split service functions for manifest and segment processing
   which require independent TCP connections from the back-end TLS
   service function to the next hop SF for each file received.
   Multiplexed server response data must be separated and forwarded on
   the proper TCP connection to support downstream re-classification.

   Though a service function chain could be used between the back-end
   and front-end TLS SFs, front-end TLS session reuse requires
   correlation between the individual TCP connections from the back-end
   TLS SF with the associated front-end TLS session.  Though it has been
   suggested that this is a control plane issue, such a suggestion
   implies that the back-end TLS SF would need to dynamically create a
   different service function chain for each response file so that their
   association to the front-end TLS session might be propagated.  Such
   an approach, however, would likely be performance prohibitive.  An
   alternate approach described herein is to use SFC metadata to
   encapsulate mid-chain flow identifiers for de/re-multiplexing of
   split-chain data.

Internet-Draft              SFC Decomposition              February 2014


2.4.  SFC Service Decomposition

   In order to take advantage of SFC for the egress path in the example
   use case described above, two additional pieces of information are
   required, i.e., an identifier for the front-end TLS session and
   message identifiers for the individual manifest and segment response
   files.  Each frame/packet sent between the back-end TLS service
   function and the front-end TLS service function should include:

   o  Split Chain ID: The decomposed service function chain identifier
      associated with one of the split paths selected by the demux
      service function.

   o  Ingress Flow ID: An identifier provided by the remux service
      function to the demux service function prior to reverse direction
      demuxing and split chain delivery.

   o  Message Sequence Number: An identifier added by the demux service
      function which associate the frames/packets for a given message,
      as well as conveys the order in which messages were received by
      the demux service function.

   On the ingress path, the ingress flow ID (associated with the front-
   end TLS session) needs to be conveyed by the front-end TLS service
   function and propogated by all service functions along the ingress
   path.  When application layer connection termination or re-
   classification occurs, the ingress flow ID must either be persistent
   across the intermediate service function, or reverse path translated
   and mapped.  A reserved service function chain identifier may be used
   to accompany metadata across re-classifications.

   On the ingress path, for a front-end TLS session X, the following
   table shows the SFC ID, flow ID, and message sequence number, for two
   HTTP messages (each consisting of multiple TCP/IP packets) traversing
   service functions 1, 2, and 3.  Along each hop, the FLOW_RES SFC ID
   is used to convey the ingress flow ID X from service function 1 to
   service function 3.

            +--------+--------+----------+---------+----------+
            | src SF | dst SF | SFC ID   | Flow ID | Mesg Seq |
            +--------+--------+----------+---------+----------+
            | 1      | 2      | FLOW_RES | X       | 1        |
            | 2      | 3      | FLOW_RES | X       | 1        |
            | 1      | 2      | FLOW_RES | X       | 2        |
            | 2      | 3      | FLOW_RES | X       | 2        |

   On the egress path, for front-end TLS session X, the following table
   table shows the SFC ID, flow ID, and message sequence number, for
   four HTTP messages (each consisting of multiple TCP/IP packets)
   traversing service functions 3, 4, 5, and 1.  Two of the messages
   (i.e., 1 and 3) are statefully classified as manifest files for flow
   X, traversing service functions 3, 4, and 1, represented by SFC ID
   M1.  The other two messages (i.e., 2 and 4) are statefully classified
   as segment files for flow X, traversing service functions 3, 5, and
   1, represented by SFC ID S2.  In all cases, the flow ID X is
   included, corresponding to the ingress HTTP flow ID.
