1  Abstract

The pieces of the specification of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), 
and subsets thereof, span several documents which have evolved 
independently over time.  This memo provides the definitive
overview of the (currently) relevant documentation. As such, it acts as 
a definition of the core standard for URIs, incorporating existing
standards documents by reference.


2  Conventions Used in this Document

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3  Introduction

Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) provide a simple and extensible
means for identifying a resource.  A URI can be further classified as a 
locator, a name, or both.  The term "Uniform Resource Locator" (URL) 
refers to the subset of URIs that identify resources via a 
representation of their primary access mechanism (e.g., their network 
"location"), rather than identifying the resource by name or by some 
other attribute(s) of that resource.   The term "Uniform Resource Name"
(URN) refers to the subset of URIs that are required to remain globally
unique and persistent even when the resource ceases to exist or becomes 
unavailable. A URI "scheme" defines the namespace of the URI, and
thus may further restrict the syntax and semantics of identifiers
using that scheme. 

Throughout the history of the discussion of URIs there has been a 
steady stream of documentation published to describe various elements 
of conceptual models, syntaxes, related services, and particular 
schemes.  This dispersed collection of documentation does not serve the 
purpose of a clear specification of the URI standard, and is certainly 
confusing to people who haven't been involved in the discussions since 
the outset.

This memo singles out the key documents that comprise the core
definition of URIs and their use.  

Key areas of the specification are definition and syntax (Section 4),
use/resolution (Section 5), and associated registration requirements
(Section 6).  As additional clarification, some of the documents
that provide useful informational background or have historical
importance, that are not part of the current URI definition are
mentioned in Section 7.


4  URI structure

The definition of the generic syntax of URIs is presented in [RFC2396].
All URIs MUST conform to this syntax.

Additionally, further syntactic restrictions of URIs for Uniform
Resource Names (URNs) are defined in [RFC2141].   All URNs MUST
adhere to this syntax.


5  Use of existing URIs

Typically, the handling of URIs of particular schemes is defined
in individual documents to that purpose.  URI schemes are registered
with IANA, and registrations (with pointers to official documentation)
are viewable at [IANAURL].

Similarly, URN namespaces are registered with IANA, and can
be reviewed at [IANAURN].

Additioanlly, a global resolution service, which is RECOMMENDED for 
global resolution of URNs, but also has application for URIs of all 
schemes, is defined in [RFCXXXX].


6  Creation of new URIs 

The creation of new identifiers is governed by the syntactic and
(where applicable) other rules laid out for each URI scheme or URN 
namespace.  

The process for creating new URI schemes is outlined in [RFC2717].

See [RFC2611] for information on how to create a new URN namespace.

Information about the process for inclusion of a URN namespace
in the global resolution service defined in [RFCXXXX] is given in
[RFCYYYY].


7  Informational/historical reading

The documentation referred to in the preceeding sections provides
a complete definition of the URI standard.  However, earlier
documentation can provide informative insight into the evolution
of URIs.  The first documents discussing URIs (then "universal"
resource identifiers) were [RFC1630], [RFC1736], and [RFC1738].
[RFC1738] and [RFC1808] provided the first definition of URI
syntax (and syntax for "relative" URIs), as well as the definition
of the first URI schemes.  For URI syntax, these documents have
been replaced by [RFC2396].

Guidelines for the creation of new URI schemes are outlined
in [RFC2718].

Additional information regarding the general principles behind,
and goals of, URNs can be found in [RFC2267].  The global resolution
service for URNs/URIs was originally described experimentally in 
[RFC2168], but that has been replaced by a suite of standards-track
documents, of which [RFCXXXX] defines the URN/URI resolution
application.


8  Security Considerations

This document does not discuss material that introduces new
causes for considerations of security.  The issues of security
in URIs are discussed in the individual documents referenced herein.
