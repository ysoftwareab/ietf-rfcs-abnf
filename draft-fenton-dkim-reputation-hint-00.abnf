r= Reputation hint (plain-text; OPTIONAL, default is null value).
      This tag is a hint which MAY be used by verifiers and reputation
      systems for classifying messages at a level of granularity finer
      than that of the signing domain.  The value of this tag is
      significant only to the signer.  Messages from the same signing
      domain (d= value) with equal r= values MAY be considered together
      when accruing and obtaining reputation information.  The r= value
      is significant only within a given signing domain; messages with
      equal r= values but different d= values MUST NOT be considered
      together unless information relating the domains is available
      through a trusted out-of-band mechanism.
