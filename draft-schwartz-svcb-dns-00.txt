                  Service Binding Mapping for DNS URIs
                       draft-schwartz-svcb-dns-00

Abstract

   The SVCB DNS record type expresses a bound collection of endpoint
   metadata, for use when establishing a connection to a named service.
   DNS itself can be such a service, when the server is identified by a
   hostname in a "dns:" URI.  This document provides the SVCB mapping
   for name-based DNS URIs, allowing DNS servers to indicate support for
   new transport protocols.

1.  Introduction

   The SVCB record type [SVCB] provides clients with information about
   how to reach alternative endpoints for a service, which may have
   improved performance or privacy properties.  The service is typically
   identified by a URI containing a scheme and an authority (a hostname
   and optionally a port).

Internet-Draft               SVCB for dns://                 August 2020


   The "dns:" URI scheme [DNSURI] describes a way to represent DNS
   queries as URIs.  This scheme optionally includes an authority,
   comprised of a host and port number (with a default of 53).  DNS URIs
   often omit the authority, or specify an IP address, but a hostname is
   allowed.

   Use of the SVCB record type with a URI scheme requires a mapping
   document, indicating how a client for that scheme can interpret the
   contents of the SVCB SvcParams.  This document provides the mapping
   for DNS URIs that contain a hostname authority, allowing the server
   to offer alternative endpoints and transports, including encrypted
   transports like DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Name form

   Names are formed using Port-Prefix Naming ([SVCB] Section 2.3).  For
   example, "dns://dns1.example.com:5353" would be converted to the
   domain "_5353._dns.dns1.example.com.".

4.  Applicable existing SvcParamKeys

4.1.  port

   This key is used to indicate the target port for connection.  If
   omitted, the client SHALL use the default port for each transport
   protocol: 853 for DNS over TLS and 443 for DNS over HTTPS.

   This key is automatically mandatory if present.

4.2.  alpn and no-default-alpn

   These keys indicate the set of supported protocols.  The default
   protocol is "dot", indicating support for DNS over TLS [DOT].

   If the protocol set contains any HTTP versions (e.g. "h2", "h3"),
   then the record indicates support for DNS over HTTPS [DOH], and the
   "dohpath" key MUST be present (Section 5.1).  All keys specified for
   use with the HTTPS record are also permissible, and apply to the
   resulting HTTP connection.

Internet-Draft               SVCB for dns://                 August 2020


   If the protocol set contains protocols with different default ports,
   and no port key is specified, then protocols are contacted separately
   on their default ports.  Note that in this configuration, ALPN
   negotiation does not defend against cross-protocol downgrade attacks.

   These keys are automatically mandatory if present.

4.3.  Other applicable SvcParamKeys

   These SvcParamKeys apply to the "dns" scheme without modification:

   *  echconfig

   *  ipv4hint

   *  ipv6hint

5.  New SvcParamKeys

5.1.  dohpath

   "dohpath" is a single-valued SvcParamKey whose value (both in
   presentation and wire format) is a relative URI Template [RFC6570],
   normally starting with "/".  If the "alpn" SvcParamKey indicates
   support for HTTP, clients MAY construct a DNS over HTTPS URI Template
   by combining the prefix "https://", the authority hostname from the
   "dns://" URI, the port from the "port" key if present, and the
   "dohpath" value.  (The port from the "dns://" URI MUST NOT be used.)

   Clients SHOULD NOT query for any "HTTPS" RRs when using the
   constructed URI Template.  Instead, the SvcParams and address records
   associated with this SVCB record SHOULD be used for the HTTPS
   connection, with the same semantics as an HTTPS RR.  However, for
   consistency, server operators SHOULD publish an equivalent HTTPS RR,
   especially if clients might learn this URI Template through a
   different channel.

6.  Limitations

   DNS URIs convey limited information to the client.  For example, they
   do not indicate whether the query should include the "recursion
   desired", "DNSSEC OK", or "checking disabled" flags.  Clients must
   know the appropriate values for these flags in their use case.
   Similarly, nothing in this document indicates the set of names for
   which the server is willing or able to answer queries.

7.  Examples

   *  A resolver at "dns://resolver.example" that supports

      -  DNS over TLS on "resolver.example", port 853 and 8530, with
         "resolver.example" as the Authentication Domain Name,

      -  DNS over HTTPS at "https://resolver.example/dns-query{?dns}",
         and

      -  an experimental protocol on "fooexp.resolver.example:5353":

         $ORIGIN example.
         _dns.resolver 7200 IN SVCB 1 resolver (
           alpn=h2,h3 echconfig=... dohpath=/dns-query{?dns} )
         _dns.resolver 7200 IN SVCB 2 resolver (
           port=8530 echconfig=... )
         _dns.resolver 7200 IN SVCB 3 fooexp.resolver ( port=5353
           echconfig=... alpn=foo no-default-alpn foo-info=... )

   *  A nameserver at "dns://ns.example" whose service configuration is
      published on a different domain:

      $ORIGIN example.
      _dns.ns 7200 IN SVCB 0 _dns.ns.nic

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Adversary on the query path

   This section considers an adversary who can add or remove responses
   to the SVCB query.

   Clients MUST authenticate the server to its name during secure
   transport establishment.  This name is the hostname present in the
   DNS URI, and cannot be influenced by the SVCB record contents.
   Accordingly, this draft does not mandate the use of DNSSEC.  This
   draft also does not specify how clients authenticate the name (e.g.
   selection of roots of trust), which might vary according to the
   context.











Schwartz                 Expires 5 February 2021                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               SVCB for dns://                 August 2020


   Although this adversary cannot alter the authentication name of the
   server, it does have control of the port number and "dohpath" value.
   As a result, the adversary can direct DNS queries for
   "dns://$HOSTNAME" to any port on $HOSTNAME, and any path on
   "https://$HOSTNAME", even if $HOSTNAME is not actually a DNS server.
   If the DNS client uses shared TLS or HTTP state, the client could be
   correctly authenticated (e.g. using a TLS client certificate or HTTP
   cookie).

   This behavior creates a number of possible attacks for certain server
   configurations.  For example, if "https://$HOSTNAME/upload" accepts
   any POST request as a file upload, the adversary could forge a SVCB
   record containing "dohpath=/upload", causing the client to upload
   every query, resulting in unexpected storage costs.

   As a mitigation, a client of this SVCB mapping MUST NOT provide
   client authentication for DNS queries, except to servers that it
   specifically knows are not vulnerable to such attacks.  Also, if an
   alternative service endpoint sends an invalid response to a DNS
   query, the client SHOULD NOT send more queries to that endpoint.

8.2.  Adversary on the transport path

   This section considers an adversary who can modify network traffic
   between the client and the SvcDomainName (i.e. the destination
   server).

   A client that attempts a connection using an encrypted DNS transport
   from a SVCB record SHOULD NOT fall back to unencrypted DNS if
   connection fails.  (This is different from the advice in Section 3 of
   [SVCB], which assumes the default transport is secured.)
   Specifications making using of this mapping MAY adjust this fallback
   behavior to suit their requirements.

9.  IANA Considerations

   Per [SVCB] IANA would be directed to add the following entry to the
   SVCB Service Parameters registry.

   +========+=========+==============================+=================+
   | Number | Name    | Meaning                      | Reference       |
   +========+=========+==============================+=================+
   | TBD    | dohpath | DNS over HTTPS path template | (This           |
   |        |         |                              | document)       |
