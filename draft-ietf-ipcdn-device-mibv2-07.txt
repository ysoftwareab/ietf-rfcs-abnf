1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

Internet-Draft           DOCSIS Cable Device MIB            January 2005


3.  Introduction

   This MIB module provides a set of objects required for the management
   of DOCSIS-compliant Cable Modems (CM) and Cable Modem Termination
   Systems (CMTS).  The specification is derived from the DOCSIS Radio
   Frequency Interface specification [RFI1.0].  Please note that the
   DOCSIS 1.0 standard only required Cable Modems to implement SNMPv1
   and to process Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) customer traffic.
   Design choices in the original version of this MIB module reflected
   those requirements.  DOCSIS 1.1 [RFI1.1] and DOCSIS 2.0 [RFI2.0]
   require support for SNMPv3, as well as SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, and the
   changes in this MIB module over the previous proposed standard
   version reflect those additional requirements.

   Future versions of DOCSIS are expected to require support for
   Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) as both a Customer Premise
   Equipment (CPE) protocol and one supported by the network elements of
   the DOCSIS CMTS/CM system.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.1  Structure of the MIB

   This MIB module is structured into seven components.  A component
   contains one or more MIB groups related by deprecation or logical
   extension.
   o  The docsDevBaseGroup extends the MIB-II 'system' group with
      objects needed for cable device system management.  Related to
      this group is the docsDevBaseIgmpGroup (enabling Internet Group
      Management Protocol (IGMP) status and control) and the
      docsDevBaseMaxCpeGroup (managing the maximum number of CPEs
      permitted access through the cable modem).
   o  The docsDevNmAccessGroup and the docsDevNmAccessExtGroup provide a
      minimum level of SNMP access security (see Section 3 of
      [OSSI1.0]).  With the completion of the SNMP coexistence document,
      RFC 3584 [RFC3584], these groups have been deprecated in this
      version of the MIB.
   o  The docsDevSoftwareGroup, updated by the docsDevSoftwareGroupV2,
      provides information for network-downloadable software upgrades.
      See "Handling of Software Upgrades" below.
   o  The docsDevServerGroup, updated by the docsDevServerGroupV2,
      provides information about the progress of the interaction between
      the CM or CMTS and various provisioning servers.
   o  The docsDevEventGroup, updated by the docsDevEventGroupV2,
      provides control and logging for event reporting.

Internet-Draft           DOCSIS Cable Device MIB            January 2005


   o  The docsDevFilterGroup configures filters at link layer and IP
      layer for bridged data traffic.  This group has been deprecated in
      this version of the MIB in favor of the docsDevFilterLLCGroup, and
      by groups from the Differentiated Services MIB [RFC3289] --
      specifically the groups representing the Data Path, Classifier,
      and Actions tables from that MIB.
   o  The docsDevCpeGroup, updated by the docsDevInetCpeGroup, provides
      control over which IP addresses may be used by CPEs (e.g.  PCs)
      serviced by a given cable modem.  This provides anti-spoofing
      control at the point of origin for a large cable modem system.
      This group is separate from docsDevFilter primarily as this group
      is only implemented on the Cable Modem (CM) and MUST NOT be
      implemented on the Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS).

3.1.1  IPv4 Compliance

   Please note that the compliance statements in this version of the MIB
   module require support only for IPv4 addresses.  That is because they
   current version of the DOCSIS protocols (1.0, 1.1, and 2.0) are not
   IPv6-capable.  Although support for IPv6 will require changes to the
   DOCSIS protocols, it is expected that the only changes needed to the
   MIB module itself will be the addition of new compliance statements
   that mandate support for IPv6 addresses.

3.2  Management requirements

3.2.1  Handling of Software upgrades

   The Cable Modem software upgrade process is documented in [RFI1.0].
   From a network management station, the operator:
   o  sets docsDevSwServer to the address of the Trivial File Transfer
      Protocol (TFTP) server for software upgrades
   o  sets docsDevSwFilename to the file pathname of the software
      upgrade image
   o  sets docsDevSwAdminStatus to upgrade-from-mgt

   While DOCSIS only specifies the implementation of the TFTP protocol
   [RFC1350] for file transfers, other functional entities embedded
   within the cable device (particularly a PacketCable Multimedia
   Terminal Adapter [MTA-PROV]) specify the optional implementation of
   the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC1945][RFC2616] for file
   transfers.  The value of the docsDevSwServerTransportProtocol object
   determines which protocol is used for SNMP-initiated software
   upgrade.

   One reason for the SNMP-initiated upgrade is to allow loading of a
   temporary software image (e.g., special diagnostic software) that
   differs from the software normally used on that device without

Internet-Draft           DOCSIS Cable Device MIB            January 2005


   changing the provisioning database.

   Note that software upgrades should not be accepted blindly by the
   cable device.  The cable device may refuse an upgrade if:
   o  The download is incomplete.
   o  The file contents are incomplete or damaged.
   o  The software is not intended for that hardware device (may include
      the case of a feature set that has not been purchased for this
      device).

   A cable device that implements the code verification mechanisms of
   [BPIPLUS] verifies the source and integrity of the downloaded image
   by validating one or more Code Verification Signatures that are
   bundled within the software upgrade.

3.2.2  Events and Notifications

   This MIB module provides control facilities for reporting events
   through syslog [RFC3164], notifications (traps and informs), and
   non-volatile logging.

   The conventions for event reporting are outside the scope of this
   document.  The definition and coding of common DOCSIS notifications
   can be found in [I-D.ietf-ipcdn-docsisevent-mib].

3.2.3  Notification Throttling

   The CM and CMTS MUST provide support for notification message
   throttling as described below.  The network operator can employ
   notification rate throttling or notification limiting by manipulating
   the appropriate MIB variables.

3.2.3.1  Notification rate throttling

   Network operators may employ either of two rate control methods.  In
   the first method, the device ceases to send notifications when the
   rate exceeds the specified maximum message rate.  It resumes sending
   notifications only if reactivated by a network management station
   request.

   In the second method, the device resumes sending notifications when
   the rate falls below the specified maximum message rate.

   The network operator configures the specified maximum message rate by
   setting the measurement interval (in seconds), and the maximum number
   of notifications to be transmitted within the measurement interval.
   The operator can query the operational throttling state (to determine
   whether notifications are enabled or blocked by throttling) of the



Woundy & Marez            Expires July 5, 2005                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           DOCSIS Cable Device MIB            January 2005


   device, as well as query and set the administrative throttling state
   (to manage the rate control method) of the device.

3.2.3.2  Limiting the notification rate

   Network operators may wish to limit the number of notifications sent
   by a device over a specified time period.  The device ceases to send
   notifications when the number of notifications exceeds the specified
   threshold.  It resumes sending notifications only when the
   measurement interval has passed.

   The network operator defines the maximum number of notifications he
   is willing to handle and sets the measurement interval to a large
   number (in hundredths of a second).  For this case, the
   administrative throttling state is set to stop at threshold which is
   the maximum number of notifications.

   See "Techniques for Managing Asynchronously Generated Alerts"
   [RFC1224] for additional technical motivations.

3.3  Protocol Filters

   The Cable Device MIB provides objects for both Link Layer Control
   (LLC) and IP protocol filters.  The LLC protocol filter entries can
   be used to limit CM forwarding to a restricted set of network-layer
   protocols (such as IP, Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), Network
   Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS), and Appletalk).

   The IP protocol filter entries can be used to restrict upstream or
   downstream traffic based on source and destination IP addresses,
   transport-layer protocols (such as Transport Control Protocol (TCP),
   User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Internet Control Message Protocol
   (ICMP)), and source and destination TCP/UDP port numbers.

   In general, a cable modem applies filters (or more properly,
   classifiers) in an order appropriate to the layering model.
   Specifically, the inbound MAC (or LLC) layer filters are applied
   first, then the "special" filters, then the IP layer inbound filters,
   then the IP layer outbound filters, then any final LLC outbound
   filters.

3.3.1  Inbound LLC Filters - docsDevFilterLLCTable

   The inbound LLC (or MAC or level-2) filters are contained in the
   docsDevFilterLLCTable and are applied to level-2 frames entering the
   cable modem from either the RF MAC interface or from one of the CPE
   interfaces (physical or logical).  These filters are used to prohibit
   the processing and forwarding of certain types of level-2 traffic
   that may be disruptive to the network.  The filters, as currently
   specified, can be set to cause the modem to either drop frames which
   match at least one filter, or to process a frame which matches at

   least one filter.  Some examples of possible configurations would be
   to only permit IP (and ARP) traffic, or to drop NetBIOS traffic.

3.3.2  Special Filters

   Special filters are applied after the packet is accepted from the MAC
   layer by the IP module, but before any other processing is done.
   They are filters that apply only to a very specific class of traffic.

3.3.2.1  IP Spoofing Filters - docsDevCpeTable, docsDevCpeInetTable

   IP spoofing filters are applied to packets entering the modem from
   one of the CPE interfaces and are intended to prevent a subscriber
   from stealing or mis-using IP addresses that were not assigned to the
   subscriber.  If the filters are active (enabled), the source address
   of the IP packet must match at least one IP address in one of these
   two tables (docsDevCpeTable or docsDevCpeInetTable) or it is
   discarded without further processing.

   To prevent potential implementation ambiguity, the device consults
   the docsDevCpeTable for the IP packet source address, before
   consulting the docsDevCpeInetTable.

   The table can be automatically populated where the first N different
   IP addresses seen from the CPE side of the cable modem are used to
   automatically populate the table.  The spoofing filters are specified
   in the docsDevCpeTable and the docsDevCpeInetTable, and the policy
   for automatically creating filters in those tables is controlled by
   docsDevCpeEnroll and docsDevCpeMax as well as the network management
   agent.

   Similar IP spoofing filter controls are defined for CMTS
   implementation in the Subscriber Management MIB
   [I-D.ietf-ipcdn-subscriber-mib].

3.3.2.2  SNMP Access Filters - docsDevNmAccessTable

   The SNMP access filters are applied to SNMP packets entering from any
   interface and destined for the cable modem.  If the packets enter
   from a CPE interface, the SNMP filters are applied after the IP
   spoofing filters.  The filters only apply to SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c
   traffic, and are not consulted for SNMPv3 traffic (and need not be
   implemented by a v3 only agent).  SNMPv3 access control is specified
   in the User Security Model MIB in [RFC3414].

   With the completion of the SNMP coexistence document, RFC 3584

   agents should handle the interaction between RFC 3584 MIBs and this
   MIB.

3.3.3  IP Filtering - docsDevFilterIpTable

   The IP Filtering table acts as a classifier table.  Each row in the
   table describes a template against which IP packets are compared.
   The template includes source and destination addresses (and their
   associated masks), upper level protocol (e.g.  TCP, UDP), source and
   destination port ranges, and Terms of Service (ToS) values.  A row
   also contains interface and traffic direction match values which have
   to be considered in combination.  All columns of a particular row
   must match the appropriate fields in the packet, and must match the
   interface and direction items for the packet to result in a match to
   the packet.

   When classifying a packet, each table is scanned beginning with the
   lowest number filter.  If the agent finds a match, it applies the
   group of policies specified.  If the matched filter has the continue
   bit set, the agent continues the scan possibly matching additional
   filters and applying additional policies.  For example, this allows
   the agent to take one set of actions for the 24.0.16/255.255.255.0
   group and one set of actions for telnet packets to/from 24.0.16.30,
   and these sets of actions may not be mutually exclusive.

   Once a packet is matched, one of three actions happen based on the
   setting of docsDevFilterIpControl in the row.  The packet may be
   dropped, in which case no further processing is required.  The packet
   may be accepted and processing of the packet continues.  Lastly, the
   packet may have a set of policy actions applied to it.  If
   docsDevFilterIpContinue is set to true, scanning of the table
   continues and additional matches may result.

   When a packet matches, and docsDevFilterIpControl in the filter
   matched is set to 'policy', the value of docsDevFilterIpPolicyId is
   used as a selector into the docsDevFilterPolicyTable.  The first
   level of indirection may result in zero or more actions being taken
   based on the match.  The docsDevFilterPolicyTable is scanned in row
   order and all rows where docsDevFilterPolicyId equals
   docsDevFilterIpPolicyId have the action specified by
   docsDevFilterPolicyValue 'executed'.

   For an example of the use of these IP Filtering MIB tables, see
   [RFC2669].

   The IP Filtering table and related tables have been deprecated in
   this version of the MIB in favor of the Data Path, Classifier, and
   Action tables from the Differentiated Services MIB [RFC3289].  See

   the body of the MIB for the description of how agents should handle
   the interaction between RFC 3289 MIBs and this MIB module.

3.3.4  Outbound LLC Filters

   Lastly, any outbound LLC filters are applied to the packet just prior
   to it being emitted on the appropriate interface.  This MIB module
   does not specify any outbound LLC filters, but it is anticipated that
   the Quality of Service (QoS) additions to the DOCSIS standard
   [I-D.ietf-ipcdn-qos-mib] may include some outbound LLC filtering
   requirements.  If so, those filters would be applied as described
   there.

                index values).  Packets which match no filters will have
                policy 0 in the docsDevFilterPolicyTable applied to
                them if it exists.  Otherwise, Packets which match no
                filters are discarded or forwarded according to the
                setting of docsDevFilterIpDefault.

                Any IP packet can theoretically match multiple rows of
                this table.  When considering a packet, the table is
                scanned in row index order (e.g. filter 10 is checked
                before filter 20).  If the packet matches that filter
                (which means that it matches ALL criteria for that row),
                actions appropriate to docsDevFilterIpControl and
                docsDevFilterPolicyId are taken.  If the packet was
                discarded processing is complete.  If
                docsDevFilterIpContinue is set to true, the filter
                comparison continues with the next row in the table
                looking for additional matches.

                If the packet matches no filter in the table, the packet
                is accepted or dropped for further processing based on
                the setting of docsDevFilterIpDefault.  If the packet is
                accepted, the actions specified by policy group 0
                (e.g. the rows in docsDevFilterPolicyTable which have a
                value of 0 for docsDevFilterPolicyId) are taken if that
                policy group exists.

                Logically, this table is consulted twice during the
                processing of any IP packet - once upon its acceptance
                from the L2 entity, and once upon its transmission to
                the L2 entity.  In actuality, for cable modems, IP
                filtering is generally the only IP processing done for
                transit traffic.  This means that inbound and outbound
                filtering can generally be done at the same time with
                one pass through the filter table.

                The objects in this table are only accessible from cable
                devices which are not operating in DiffServ MIB mode
                (RFC 3289).  See the conformance section for details.

                Note that some devices are required by other
                specifications, e.g. the DOCSIS OSSIv1.1 specification,
                to support the legacy SNMPv1/v2c docsDevFilter mode
                for backward compatibility.

                Table entries are not required to persist across
                reboots for any device.

5.  Acknowledgments

   This document is a production of the IPCDN Working Group, and is a
   revision of RFC 2669, "Cable Device Management Information Base for
   DOCSIS-compliant Cable Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems"
   [RFC2669].  Mike StJohns and Guenter Roeck served well as the editors
   of previous versions of this MIB module.

   The editor specifically wishes to thank Howard Abramson, Eduardo
   Cardona, Andre Lejeune, Kevin Marez, Jean-Francois Mule, Greg
   Nakanishi, Pak Siripunkaw, Boris Tsekinovski, Bert Wijnen, and Bill
   Yost for their contributions to this document.

5.1  Revision Descriptions

   [Note to RFC Editor - this section may be removed upon publication as
   an RFC.]

   This document contains the following revisions over RFC 2669:
   o  All IPv4 address objects were either deprecated and replaced, or
      mirrored with IPv6 objects where appropriate, following the
      guidelines of RFC 3291 [RFC3291].  In particular,
      docsDevCpeInetTable was added, and the docsDevFilterGroup objects
      were deprecated in favor of the DiffServ MIB.
   o  Objects which were obviated by SNMPv3 and the SNMP Coexistence
      MIBs have been deprecated, e.g.  docsDevNmAccessTable.
   o  A new object, docsDevIgmpModeControl, has been added to control
      passive versus active IGMP modem operation.
   o  A new object, docsDevMaxCpe, has been added to report the maximum
      number of CPEs granted network access across the CM.
   o  A new object, docsDevSwServerTransportProtocol, has been added to
      docsDevSoftware, and other object DESCRIPTIONs have been modified,
      to enable the use of either TFTP or HTTP for software downloads to
      the device.
   o  A new object, docsDevEvThrottleThresholdExceeded, has been added
      to replace docsDevEvThrottleInhibited for simplification of event
      threshold management.
   o  The docsDevEvReporting object has been modified to enable local
      logging to the internal volatile log, and not to the internal
      non-volatile log,
   o  Minor updates to the description text have been made to a number
      of objects to clarify their meaning.
   o  The compliance statements were updated to reflect current
      requirements (including making the docsDevCpe objects optional),
      and split between CM and CMTS devices.

6.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module relates to a system which will provide metropolitan
   public internet access.  As such, improper manipulation of the
   objects represented by this MIB module may result in denial of
   service to a large number of end-users.  In addition, manipulation of
   the docsDevNmAccessTable, docsDevFilterLLCTable,
   docsDevFilterIpTable, docsDevFilterInetTable, and the elements of the
   docsDevCpe and docsDevCpeInetTable groups may allow an end-user to
   increase their service levels, spoof their IP addresses, change the
   permitted management stations, or affect other end-users in either a
   positive or negative manner.

   It is recommended that the implementers prevent the "tiny fragment"
   and "overlapping fragment" attacks for the IP filtering tables in
   this MIB module, as discussed in [RFC1858] and [RFC3128].  Prevention
   of these attacks can be implemented with the following rules, when
   TCP source and/or destination port filtering is enabled:
   o  admit all packets with fragment offset >= 2
   o  discard all packets with fragment offset = 1, or with fragment
      offset = 0 AND fragment payload length < 16.
   o  apply filtering rules to all packets with fragment offset = 0.

   This MIB module does not affect confidentiality of services on a
   cable modem system.  [BPI] and [BPIPLUS] specify the implementation
   of the DOCSIS Baseline Privacy and Baseline Privacy Plus mechanisms
   for data transmission confidentiality.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
   o  The use of docsDevNmAccessTable to specify management stations is
      considered to be only limited protection and does not protect
      against attacks which spoof the management station's IP address.
      The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be
      considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 USM [RFC3414] and
      VACM [RFC3415] MUST be used with any v3 agent which implements
      this MIB module.
   o  The CM may have its software changed by the actions of the
      management system using a combination of the following objects:
      docsDevSwServer, docsDevSwFilename, docsDevSwAdminStatus,
      docsDevSwServerAddressType, docsDevSwServerAddress, and
      docsDevSwServerTransportProtocol.  An improper software download
      may result in substantial vulnerabilities and the loss of the

      ability of the management system to control the cable modem.  A
      cable device SHOULD implement the code verification mechanisms of
      [BPIPLUS] to verify the source and integrity of downloaded
      software images.
   o  The device may be reset by setting docsDevResetNow = true(1).
      This causes the device to reload its configuration files as well
      as eliminating all previous non-persistent network management
      settings.  As such, this may provide a vector for attacking the
      system.
   o  Setting docsDevEvThrottleAdminStatus = unconstrained(1) (which is
      also the DEFVAL) may cause flooding of traps, which can disrupt
      network service.  Additionally, docsDevThrottleThreshold and
      docsDevThrottleInterval could also be set to high values that may
      cause a disruption in service.
   o  Setting docsDevDateTime to an arbitrary (incorrect) value would
      merely cause the device to record incorrect timestamps on many
      events/actions that rely on this object for reporting.
   o  Setting docsDevEvControl to resetLog(1) will delete any event log
      history and could potentially impact debugging/troubleshooting
      efforts.
   o  Setting docsDevEvSyslog.
   o  Setting docsDevEvReporting to enable syslog reporting, along with
      a redirect of the syslog server could allow access to sensitive
      information on network devices.  Modifying docsDevEvSyslog,
      docsDevEvSyslogAddressType or docsDevEvSyslogAddress could allow a
      redirect of sensitive information.
   o  Setting docsDevFilterLLCnmatchedAction or docsDevFilterIpDefault
      could cause significant changes to default traffic filtering on a
      device.
   o  Setting docsDevCpeEnroll to any(2) could cause the
      docsDevFilterCPETable to be populated, which may not be the
      intended functionality.
   o  Setting docsDevCpeIpMax to a value other than is intended by the
      MSO may allow a user to provision more devices than the MSO would
      like.
   o  Setting values in the docsDevNmAccess table can potentially
      introduce a mechanism for users to use a local NMS device and
      manipulate other settings in the CM or CMTS.
   o  Setting values in the docsDevFilterLLC and docsDevFilterIP tables
      can allow/deny access to certain devices that the MSO does not
      want.
   o  Setting docsDevCpeStatus and docsDevCpeInetRowStatus may allow
      users to provision more/different devices than was intended by the
      MSO.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to

   control even GET access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt
   the values of these objects when sending them over the network via
   SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:
   o  Rows from docsDevNmAccessTable may provide sufficient information
      for attackers to spoof management stations which have management
      access to the device.
   o  The docsDevSwCurrentVers object may provide hints as to the
      software vulnerabilities of the cable device.
   o  The docsDevFilterLLCTable and docsDevFilterLLCTable may provide
      clues for attacking the cable device and other subscriber devices.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
