                    draft-atwood-mcast-user-auth-01

Abstract

   RFC 1112 offers no facilities for participant control or accounting.
   This document explores the requirements for such facilities, and
   offers a potential solution, based on extending the IGMP and MLD
   "join" operations to carry EAP and/or ERP packets.

Internet-Draft        Multicast User Authentication           March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The procedure for joining a network-level IP multicast group
   [RFC1112] an open one---a request is made by the receiving host,
   using MLD (IPv6) [RFC3810] or IGMP (IPv4) [RFC3376], and the
   multicast routing protocol (typically PIM-SM [RFC4601]) is
   responsibile for building a Data Distribution Tree (DDT) to ensure
   that the data are delivered to the receiving host(s).

   The procedure for joining an application-level group clearly depends
   on the application.  When IP multicast is used as the data
   distribution technology, then it is desirable to be able to limit
   delivery of the network-level multicast data packets to those hosts
   that have receiving users who are valid members of the application-
   level group.

   The anyone-can-send, anyone-can-receive nature of IP multicast
   [RFC1112] has resulted in restricted deployment of multicast
   distribution technology, since it is impossible to generate any
   revenue from services based on standard multicast.

   However, several pieces of the problem have received significant
   attention in recent years.  The problem of security and key
   management for application-level groups has been explored by the
   Multicast Security (MSEC) working group, and a framework devised
   [RFC3740].

   The use of AAA protocols (RADIUS [RFC2865], Diameter [RFC3588]) to
   manage network-level access has been standardized.  These protocols
   (especially Diameter) can be extended to permit controlling access to
   application-level groups.

   The requirements for "well-managed" multicast have been stated in
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-maccnt-req], and a framework for satisfying these
   requirements with the help of AAA functionality has been described in
   [I-D.ietf-mboned-multiaaa-framework].

   Finally, work is under way on securing the network routing
   infrastructure [I-D.ietf-karp-threats-reqs]
   [I-D.ietf-karp-design-guide] [I-D.ietf-karp-framework] and the
   exchanges between adjacent multicast routers
   [I-D.ietf-pim-sm-linklocal].

   However, one key piece is missing.  To minimize the resource wastage
   that would result from delivering multicast traffic to hosts that
   have no entitlement to receive them, it is necessary to authenticate
   and authorize receiving users and to correlate their right to access
   a group with the action of putting the data on that part of the

   network that is directly connected to the receiving host.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
   They indicate requirement levels for compliant PIM-SM
   implementations.


3.  Problem Statement

3.1.  Authenticating and Authorizing Multicast Users

   The design of IP multicast [RFC1112] ensures that there is no
   relationship between the receiving hosts and the sending host(s) in a
   network-level multicast group.  Multicast sending hosts do not even
   know whether there are receiving hosts or not, much less who they are
   or whether they are entitled to receive the data.  The receiving host
   issues a network-level "join" on behalf of a receiving user, using
   IGMP (IPv4) [RFC3376] or MLD (IPv6) [RFC3810], and a designated
   access router is responsible for grafting itself onto the data
   distribution tree.  The network exercises no control over this
   process---it is required to provide the data flow.

   Although specifications exist for encrypting the user data, thus
   ensuring that only legitimate users can decrypt these data, these
   specifications provide no way to ensure that the data distribution
   tree is not extended when a non-authorized receiving user makes a
   request to join the tree.  Thus, key management and receiving user
   access control have to be considered as separate problems.

   Given the lack of a relationship between the sending user(s) and the
   receiving user(s), it is difficult to create and enforce an
   appropriate business model.

3.2.  Re-authentication and Re-authorization

   Several scenarios can cause a need for re-authentication and re-
   authorization:

   o  When a user changes the group that he/she wishes to attach to;

   o  When a user changes the access router used for connection (e.g.,
      wireless roaming);

Internet-Draft        Multicast User Authentication           March 2010


   o  When a user changes the medium used for physical connectivity
      (e.g., cellular to wireless, etc.).

3.3.  Accounting

   The fact of delivery of group data needs to be recorded, to enable
   revenue to be earned.  This is only one of a range of accounting
   issues that may need to be addressed, which points to the need for a
   general solution.

3.4.  Independence of Authentication and Authorization Procedures

   There is a wide range of authentication and authorization procedures
   that may be desired by an Internet Service Provider, including some
   that may not yet be standardized.  This implies the adoption of a
   very general framework for such procedures.

3.5.  Coupling of Network and Application Level Controls

   It is conceivable that a solution could be found for the above issues
   that would be based on standard network protocols and separate
   (proprietary or standard) group management protocols.  For example,
   the key management and distribution protocol associated with the
   application-level group could have authentication as one of its
   features.  However, the separation of the network-level controls from
   the application-level controls enables a significant class of
   security attacks.  It is therefore important that control of access
   to the network resources and control of access to the application-
   level resources be strongly coupled.

3.6.  Separation of Network Access Controls from Group Access Controls

   Access to the network is different from access to a group.  As an
   example, the authorization to watch a particular video presentation
   may be associated with a specific family member, while the
   authorization to use the network connection may be associated with an
   entire family (or to anyone present in the house).

   While existing AAA procedures are designed to control network level
   access, they must be extended (or alternatives found) if group access
   must be controlled.


4.  Proposed Solution

   Two levels of action are apparent: the action of joining the network-
   level data distribution tree, and the action of joining the group,
   with its accompanying security properties.

Internet-Draft        Multicast User Authentication           March 2010


   Joining the data distribution tree should not occur unless and until
   the receiving user has been authenticated and authorized.  One way to
   ensure that this relationship is enforced is to carry the receiving
   user authentication material in the network-level join packet.

   To support multiple types of authentication methods, the Extensible
   Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748] provides a standardized
   solution.

   To support a method-independent and efficient re-authentication, the
   EAP Re-Authentication Protocol (ERP) [RFC5296] provides a possible
   solution.  ERP is applicable for mobile receivers [MulticastMobile].

   To permit correlating the join actions (at the group level and the
   network level) with the accounting procedures, the EAP/ERP packets
   that are delivered to the access router by the extended network-level
   join can be forwarded to the local AAA server for a decision, using
   existing AAA protocols, such as RADIUS or Diameter.  In keeping with
   the statement in [I-D.ietf-mboned-multiaaa-framework] that "A CP may
   delegate AAA responsibility to an NSP.", we observe that the NSP can
   distribute the responsibility among a collection of local AAA
   servers, and that there is sufficient generality in the AAA
   architectural model that a wide range of policies could be
   implemented, in support of a wide range of business models.
