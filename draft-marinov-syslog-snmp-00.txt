Internet-Draft    Mapping SNMP Notifications to SYSLOG     February 2007


1.  Introduction

   SNMP and SYSLOG are two widely used protocols to communicate event
   notifications.  Although co-existence of several management protocols
   in one operational environment is possible, certain environments
   require that all event notifications are collected by a single system
   daemon such as a SYSLOG collector or an SNMP notification receiver
   via a single management protocol.  In such environments, it is
   necessary to translate event notifications between management
   protocols.

   The latest version of SYSLOG, specified in
   [I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol], supports a structured data element
   format.  Structured data elements allow us tto map between SNMP
   notifications and SYSLOG messages without losing information.  In
   this memo we specify a concrete mapping from SNMP event notifications
   [RFC3416] into SYSLOG messages [I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol].  We
   specify how the SYSLOG message format should be utilized to carry the
   information contained in an SNMP notification message.  A new SYSLOG
   structured data element is defined which carries the PDU portion of
   an SNMP notification message.

1.1.  Conventions

   A system which has the capability of receiving SNMP notification
   messages from an SNMP Notification Originator and sending the SNMP
   data contained inside in a SYSLOG message format to a SYSLOG receiver
   is referred in this memo as an "snmp-to-syslog translator".  By
   definition, such a system should have an SNMP Notification Receiver
   application and a SYSLOG sender application running in order to be
   able to perform the functions of an "snmp-to-syslog translator".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Background

2.1.  SNMP Notifications

   A detailed introduction to the SNMP Management Framework can be found
   in [RFC3410].  The SNMP Management Architecture is described in
   [RFC3411].  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB [RFC3418].
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   SMI [RFC2578].

   An SNMP notification message is generated and transmitted by an SNMP
   entity on behalf of a Notification Originator application [RFC3413].
   SNMP notifications are often used to notify a Notification Receiver
   application at a logically remote SNMP entity that an event has
   occurred or that a certain condition is present.  There are two types
   of SNMP protocol operations that are associated with SNMP
   notification messages [RFC3416]:

   o  SNMPv2-Trap-PDU, an unconfirmed notification delivery mechanisms
   o  InformRequest-PDU, a confirmed notification delivery mechanism

   The scopedPDU portion of an SNMPv3 trap or inform message has the
   following format [RFC3412]:

          ScopedPDU ::= SEQUENCE {
              contextEngineID  OCTET STRING,
              contextName      OCTET STRING,
              data             ANY -- e.g., PDUs as defined in [RFC3416]
          }

   The data member of the SEQUENCE ScopedPDU carries a SNMPv2-Trap-PDU
   or an InformRequest-PDU.  They both have the same structure:

        PDUs ::= [7] IMPLICIT SEQUENCE {
            request-id           INTEGER,
            error-status         INTEGER,    -- ignored in notifications
            error-index          INTEGER,    -- ignored in notifications
            variable-bindings    VarBindList
        }

        -- variable binding

        VarBind ::= SEQUENCE {
            name ObjectName,

            CHOICE {
                value          ObjectSyntax,
                unSpecified    NULL,    -- in retrieval requests
                                        -- exceptions in responses
                noSuchObject   [0] IMPLICIT NULL,
                noSuchInstance [1] IMPLICIT NULL,
                endOfMibView   [2] IMPLICIT NULL
            }
        }

        -- variable-binding list

        VarBindList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (0..max-bindings)) OF VarBind

   The first two variable bindings in the variable binding list of an
   SNMPv2-Trap-PDU or InformRequest-PDU are sysUpTime.0 [RFC3418] and
   snmpTrapOID.0 [RFC3418] respectively.  If the OBJECTS clause is
   present in the invocation of the corresponding NOTIFICATION-TYPE
   macro, then each corresponding variable, as instantiated by this
   notification, is copied, in order, to the variable-bindings field.
   If any additional variables are being included (at the option of the
   generating SNMP entity), then each is copied to the variable-bindings
   field.

   In the case of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c notifications, the contextEngineID
   and the contextName parameters are not present in notification
   messages.  In general, we assume that notifications from an SNMP
   version preceding SNMPv3 are mapped into the notification format used
   by SNMPv3 according to the coexistance rules defined in RFC 3584
   [RFC3584].

2.2.  SYSLOG Notifications

   The SYSLOG protocol is defined in [I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol].  The
   message contains a global header and a number of structured data
   elements.  The ABNF [RFC4234] representation of a SYSLOG message is
   defined in RFC XXXX [I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol].  The relevant
   productions for structured data elements are:

         STRUCTURED-DATA = NILVALUE / 1*SD-ELEMENT
         SD-ELEMENT      = "[" SD-ID *(SP SD-PARAM) "]"
         SD-PARAM        = PARAM-NAME "=" %d34 PARAM-VALUE %d34
         SD-ID           = SD-NAME
         PARAM-NAME      = SD-NAME
         PARAM-VALUE     = UTF-8-STRING ; characters '"', '\' and
                                        ; ']' MUST be escaped.
         SD-NAME         = 1*32PRINTUSASCII
                           ; except '=', SP, ']', %d34 (")

         UTF-8-STRING    = *OCTET ; Any VALID UTF-8 String
                           ; "shortest form" MUST be used

         OCTET           = %d00-255
         SP              = %d32
         PRINTUSASCII    = %d33-126
         NILVALUE        = "-"


3.  Mapping SNMP Notifications to SYSLOG Notifications

   In this section, we define how the scopedPDU portion from a SNMP
   notification message is used to generate a message in the SYSLOG



Marinov & Schoenwaelder  Expires August 30, 2007                [Page 5]

   format.  The notification receiver application at the snmp-to-syslog
   translator is listening for incoming notifications.  After a
   notification is received by the SNMP engine the data portion is
   forwarded to the notification receiver application.  The data portion
   contains the scopedPDU portion of the message which is used by the
   SYSLOG sender on the snmp-to-syslog translator to generate a SYSLOG
   notification and send it to a SYSLOG receiver.  A common scenario is
   the following:



                        +-------------------+ snmp        +------------+
                        |                   |notification |snmp        |
 +---------+ syslog     |  +-------------+  |-------------|notification|
 |syslog   |notification|  |syslog sender|  |             |originator  |
 |collector|------------|  +-------------+  |             +------------+
 |         |            |  +------------+   | snmp        +------------+
 |         |            |  |snmp        |   |notification |snmp        |
 +---------+            |  |notification|   |-------------|notification|
                        |  |receiver    |   |             |originator  |
                        |  +------------+   |             +------------+
                        |  snmp-to-syslog   |snmp         +------------+
                        |    translator     |notification |snmp        |
                        |                   |-------------|notification|
                        +-------------------+             |originator  |
                                                          +------------+

   There can be many SNMP notification originators which send SNMP event
   notifications to a snmp-to-syslog translator.  The snmp-to-syslog
   translator extracts the data portion of the notification, generates a
   SYSLOG message, and send the SYSLOG message to a SYSLOG collector,
   which is responsible for collecting and storing all notification
   messages.

   The snmp-to-syslog translator is not transparent for a SYSLOG
   receiver.  The global header of the SYSLOG message generated by the
   snmp-to-syslog translator is filled with parameters that are specific
   for the system running the snmp-to-syslog translator such as its
   hostname, time stamp, etc.  The data portion (scopedPDU for SNMPv3 or
   PDU for SNMPv1/SNMPv2c) of the SNMP notification message is contained
   in the structured data of the SYSLOG message.

3.1.  SYSLOG Header

   The snmp-to-syslog translator fills the HEADER field of a SYSLOG
   message with parameters specific to the system on which it is
   running.  The default facility level for SYSLOG messages containing
   SNMP notifications should be 3, which corresponds to messages

Internet-Draft    Mapping SNMP Notifications to SYSLOG     February 2007


   generated by system daemons.  The default severity level should be 5,
   which correponds to "Notice: normal but significant condition".  If
   the snmp-to-syslog translator has a notion of the type of
   notification that has been received it might choose other values for
   facility and severity level.

   The VERSION, TIMESTAMP, HOSTNAME, APP-NAME, PROCID and MSGID fields
   in the SYSLOG message header are filled with values that are specific
   to the system on which the snmp-to-syslog translator is running.  The
   character set used in the HEADER MUST be seven-bit ASCII in an eight-
   bit field as described in [I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol].

3.2.  Structured Data

   The STRUCTURED-DATA field of a SYSLOG message will contain the
   ScopedPDU (or PDU) portion of the SNMP notification message.  For the
   purpose of carrying SNMP notification data, a new SD-ID element is
   defined.  The ABNF [RFC4234] representation of the new structured
   element is:

   present in a SYSLOG message generated by an snmp-to-syslog

   translator.  The contexdEngineID is encoded as as hexadecimal string,
   the contextName is encoded as a hexadecimal string, and the requestID
   is encoded as a signed decimal number.  Two special varbind elements
   are encoded next as an unsigned 32-bit number (sysUpTime) and an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER value in dotted notation (snmpTrapOID).

   [DISCUSS: Why do we keep the requestid?  We do not keep the PDU type
   (inform / trap) - so why is the requestid relevant?]

   [DISCUSS: Does it really make sense to special case the first two
   varbinds sysUpTime and snmpTrapOID?  The value of the later one is
   hardly readable for humans anyways.]

   The remaining parameters correspond to the remaining varbind list
   elements.  The name of a varbind is encoded as an OID in dotted
   notation and the values are encoded according to the following rules:

   o  OBJECT IDENTIFIER - denoted by a PARAM-NAME = "o" and encoded in a
      dotted-decimal notation
   o  OCTET STRING - denoted by PARAM-NAME = "s" and encoded as a
      hexadecimal string
   o  Counter32 - denoted by PARAM-NAME ="c" and encoded as an unsigned
      decimal number
   o  Counter64 - denoted by PARAM-NAME ="C" and encoded as an unsigned
      decimal number
   o  Unsigned32 - denoted by PARAM-NAME ="u" and encoded as a decimal
      number
   o  INTEGER, Integer32 - denoted by PARAM-NAME = "d" and encoded as a
      signed decimal number
   o  IpAddress - denoted by PARAM-NAME = "i" and encoded in a quad-
      decimal notation
   o  OPAQUE - denoted by PARAM-NAME = "p" and encoded as a hexadecimal
      string
   o  Timeticks - denoted by PARAM-NAME = "t" and encoded as a decimal
      number
   o  NULL - denoted by PARAM-NAME = "n" and encoded as an empty string

   The syslog message generated by the snmp-to-syslog translator may
   include other structured data elements in its structured part in
   addition to the SNMP-SD-ELEMENT.  These structured data elements are
   included in the syslog message by the syslog sender at the snmp-to-
   syslog translator and must be compliant to the specification in
   [I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol] .

3.3.  MSG Data

   The MSG part of the syslog message is optional and may contain a
   free-form message that provides a textual description of the SNMP

   event notification.  The character set used in MSG SHOULD be UNICODE,
   encoded using UTF-8 as specified in [RFC3629].  If the sender can not
   encode the MSG in Unicode, it MAY use any other encoding.


4.  Usage Example

   Here we provide an example how an SNMP linkUp trap message is mapped
   into a syslog message by using the mappings defined in Section 3.1
   and Section 3.2

   The linkUp notification is defined in [RFC2863]

 linkUp NOTIFICATION-TYPE
     OBJECTS { ifIndex, ifAdminStatus, ifOperStatus }
     STATUS  current
     DESCRIPTION
             "A linkUp trap signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an
             agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for
             one of its communication links left the down state and
             transitioned into some other state (but not into the
             notPresent state).  This other state is indicated by the
             included value of ifOperStatus."
     ::= { snmpTraps 4 }

   The scopedPDU portion of an SNMP linkUp trap sent using the SNMPv3
   message format is show below (left columns shows the BER encoding
   while the right column indicates the corresponding ASN.1
   definitions):

   [TODO: The encoding below should show a scopedPDU, but right now it
   shows only a PDU.]

   The corresponding SYSLOG message generated by the snmp-to-syslog

   be on one line.  They are wrapped on multiple lines in this document
   for readability purposes only.)

              [snmp ctxEngine="123456"
                    ctxName="ctx1"
                    reqid="7145575"
                    sysUpTime="94860"
                    snmpTrapOID="1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.4"
                    o="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.3" d="3"

                    o="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.3" d="1"]

   The corresponding syslog message has a priority value of 29 which
   means a facility level of 3 (system daemons) and a severity level of
   5 (Notice: Normal but significant condition) according to the
   algorithm for calculation of priority value specified in section
   6.2.1 of [I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol].  The rest of the fields in the
   header of the syslog message are parameters that are specific to the
   system running the snmp-to-syslog translator.  The syslog version is
   1 and the message was generated at 22:14:15.003Z on 2003-10-11T by
   the host "mymachine.example.com".  The application on the snmp-to-
   syslog translator that generated the message was "snmptrapd", there
   is no information about the process id and the message on the snmp-

   to-syslog system is identified with the MSGID of ID47.

   The syslog message contains one structured data element with a SD-ID
   of "snmp" which means that this is the scopedPDU portion of an SNMP
   event notification message.  The data which is contained in the
   notification is associated with the ContextEngineID "123456" and
   ContextName "ctx1".  The request-id of the SNMP notification message
   was "7145575".  Then follows the data portion of the scopedPDU.  The
   first two variables contained in the data portion are always the
   sysUpTime.0 and snmpTrapOID.0.  An snmpTrapOID.0 with a value of
   "1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.4" means that this is a linkUp trap.  The
   parameters o="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.3" d="3" mean that the SNMP
   notification message is carrying the ifIndex object which has a type
   INTEGER and has a value of 3.  The parameters
   o="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7.3" d="1" mean that the SNMP notification
   message is carrying the object ifAdminStatus which has type INTEGER
   and a value of 1.  The parameters o="1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.3" d="1"
   mean that the SNMP notification message is carrying the object
   ifOperStatus which has type INTEGER and a value of "1".


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the SD-ID value "snmp" together with
   the PARAM-NAME values specified in Section 3.2 in the registry for
   SYSLOG structured data id values according to section 9 in
   [I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol].
