INTERNET-DRAFT           draft-conboy-mime-opf-00            June 22, 2006



1. Introduction

   The present document seeks to register a media type for
   the Open eBook Publication Structure (OEBPS) Package File (OPF). 
   The OPF file is an XML file that describes an OEBPS Publication. 
   It identifies all other files in the publication and provides 
   descriptive information about them. OPF and its related standards 
   are maintained and defined by the International Digital Publishing 
   Forurm (IDPF).

   The media type defined here is needed to correctly identify OPF
   files when they are edited on disk, referenced in OEBPS Container 
   files, or used in other places where media types are used.


2. Security Considerations

   The OPF files contain well formed XML conforming to the XML 1.0
   specification.

   Clearly it is possible to author malicious files which, for
   example, contain malformed data. Most XML parsers protect
   themselves from such attacks by rigoriously enforcing conformance.
 
   All processors that read OPF files should rigourously check the
   size and validity of data retrieved.

   There is no current provision in the OEBPS Package File standard 
   for encryption, signing, or authentication within the file format.


3. IANA Considerations

   The present document requests that IANA registers the media type
   application/oebps-package+xml as specified in Section 3.1. The 
   registration uses the template present in [RFC4288].


3.1. Media Type for Downloadable Sounds

   Type name:                         application

   Subtype name:                      oebps-package+xml

   Required parameters:               none

   Optional parameters:               none

   Encoding considerations:           OPF files are UTF-8 or UTF-16
                                      encoded XML
