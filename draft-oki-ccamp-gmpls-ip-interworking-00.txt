Abstract

Generalized MPLS extends MPLS to support various transport technologies.
One GMPLS target is to seamlessly integrate IP/MPLS networks with vari-
ous transport networks such as SONET/SDH and wavelength networks.  How-
ever, in the migration from IP/MPLS networks to GMPLS networks, both
kinds of networks will coexist at some point.  IP/MPLS nodes that do not
support GMPLS protocols must also work with GMPLS networks.  This docu-
ment addresses the GMPLS and IP/MPLS interworking architecture, and
examples both routing and signaling aspects.

2.  Introduction

Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extends MPLS to sup-
port various transport technologies. GMPLS enables us to achieve the
seam- less integration of IP/MPLS networks with various transport net-
works such as SONET/SDH and wavelength networks. GMPLS introduces new
concepts of interface switching capability such as forwarding adjacency
label switch path (FA-LSP), and generalized labels. All nodes in GMPLS
networks are supposed to support GMPLS protocols.

However, in the migration process from IP/MPLS networks to GMPLS net-
works, both will coexist at some point in time. IP/MPLS nodes that do
not support GMPLS protocols must also work with the GMPLS network, while
IP/MPLS nodes are not modified to deal with GMPLS protocols.

Figure 1 Reference network for IP/MPLS and GMPLS networks

Figure 1 shows the reference network for IP/MPLS and GMPLS interworking.
Nodes that appears in Figure 1 are defined as follows.

GMPLS Border node (BN):  BNs are located in the GMPLS network. They sup-
port GMPLS protocols and IP/MPLS protocols. They are connected with
IP/MPLS networks.

GMPLS core node (CN): CNs are located in the GMPLS network.  They are
not connected to the IP/MPLS network. They support only GMPLS protocols.

Router or label switch router (R): Rs are located in the GMPLS network.
They support only IP/MPLS protocols, not GMPLS protocols.  They have the
functions of a router, a label switch router (LSR), or both.

Figure 1 depicts the TE-links in the GMPLS network. BNs and CNs Acquire
the topology of the GMPLS network by using a routing protocol.  The
interface switching capability of each TE-link is not specified in Fig-
ure 1. TE-links with several kinds of interface switching capabilities
can exist in the GMPLS network.  Links between BN and IN are depicted,
which are conventional subnetworks, such as point-to- point, broadcast,

NBMA, and point-to-multipoint networks.


3.2.  Routing aspects

Consider that R1 in the left IP/MPLS network communicates with R4 in the
right IP/MPLS network via the data plane of the GMPLS network in Figure
1.  R1 needs to have the routing information to R4.  However, since R1
does not support GMPLS protocols, R1 is not able to create the routing
table for the right IP/MPLS network by using the data plane of the GMPLS
network.  Routing information in terms of data plane for the GMPLS and
IP/MPLS networks MUST be exchanged. Although BN and CN can advertise
opaque LSAs to inform other nodes of the TE-links in the GMPLS network
via the existing OSPF extensions [GMPLS-OSPF], no R in the IP/MPLS net-
work can reflect the TE-links expressed by the opaque LSAs in its rout-
ing table.

Note that, from a control plane point of view, R1 in the left IP/MPLS
network communicates with R4 in the right IP/MPLS network.


3.3.  Signaling aspects

Consider that R1 in the left IP/MPLS network tries to set up a label
switched path (LSP) to R4 in the right IP/MPLS network in Figure 1.
Since R1 does not support the GMPLS protocols, R1 uses, for example, the
MPLS- based RSVP-TE signaling protocol to set up the LSP [RFC3209]. The
GMPLS network MUST deal with the MPLS-based signaling protocol without
impacting the IP/MPLS networks that support only the IP/MPLS protocols.


3.4.  Interworking architecture

One requirement is that an R in the IP/MPLS network SHOULD NOT be
affected by GMPLS protocols.  Another requirement is that an R in one
IP/MPLS network SHOULD communicate with another R in a different IP/MPLS
network.

An IP/MPLS and GMPLS interworking architecture is described.  The topo-
logical view of a R is shown in Figure 2.  The R does not notice that
GMPLS is set among IP/MPLS networks.  The R does not see any CN node. In
IP/MPLS networks, a BN node behaves as an R. If needed, a TE-link
between two BNs is defined (created), as a link between two Rs in
IP/MPLS networks, which can be either conventional subnetworks, such as
point-to-point, broadcast, NBMA, and point-to-multipoint network, or
MPLS-based TE-links.  Network operators decide which TE-link SHOULD be
defined between two BNs manually or automatically.

                      Figure 2 Topology view of R.


For example, BN1, BN2, BN3, and BN4 behave as R5, R6, R7, and R8,
respectively, to other Rs. Four TE-links are defined between R5 and R7,
R5 and R8, R6 and R7, and R6 and R8. These TE-links are advertised as
either conventional subnetworks?? or MPLS-based TE-links.
