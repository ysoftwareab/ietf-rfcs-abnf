                 Updates to the Fast Reroute Procedures for 
       Co-routed Associated Bidirectional Label Switched Paths (LSPs)

Abstract

   Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) association signaling can be
   used to bind two unidirectional LSPs into an associated bidirectional
   LSP.  When an associated bidirectional LSP is co-routed, the reverse
   LSP follows the same path as its forward LSP.  This document updates
   the Fast Reroute (FRR) procedures defined in RFC 4090 to support both
   single-sided and double-sided provisioned associated bidirectional
   LSPs.  This document also updates the procedure for associating two
   reverse LSPs defined in RFC 7551 to support co-routed bidirectional
   LSPs.  The FRR procedures can ensure that for the co-routed LSPs,
   traffic flows on co-routed paths in the forward and reverse
   directions after a failure event.

1.  Conventions Used in This Document

1.1.  Key Word Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Terminology

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology defined in
   [RFC2205], [RFC3209], [RFC4090], [RFC7551], and [RFC8271].

1.2.1.  Forward Unidirectional LSPs

   Two reverse unidirectional point-to-point (P2P) LSPs are setup in the
   opposite directions between a pair of source and destination nodes to
   form an associated bidirectional Label Switched Path (LSP).  In the
   case of single-sided provisioned LSP, the originating LSP with
   REVERSE_LSP Object [RFC7551] is identified as a forward
   unidirectional LSP.  In the case of double-sided provisioned LSP, the
   LSP originating from the higher node address (as source) and
   terminating on the lower node address (as destination) is identified
   as a forward unidirectional LSP.

1.2.2.  Reverse Co-routed Unidirectional LSPs

   Two reverse unidirectional point-to-point (P2P) LSPs are setup in the
   opposite directions between a pair of source and destination nodes to
   form an associated bidirectional Label Switched Path (LSP).  A
   reverse unidirectional LSP originates on the same node where the
   forward unidirectional LSP terminates, and it terminates on the same
   node where the forward unidirectional LSP originates.  A reverse co-
   routed unidirectional LSP traverses along the same path as the
   forward direction unidirectional LSP in the opposite direction.


2.  Introduction

   The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) (Extended) ASSOCIATION
   Object is specified in [RFC6780] which can be used generically to
   associate Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS
   (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). 
   [RFC7551] defines mechanisms for binding two point-to-point
   unidirectional LSPs [RFC3209] into an associated bidirectional LSP. 
   There are two models described in [RFC7551] for provisioning an

   associated bidirectional LSP, single-sided and double-sided.  In both
   models, the reverse LSP of the bidirectional LSP may or may not be
   co-routed and follow the same path as its forward LSP.

   In packet transport networks, there are requirements where the
   reverse LSP of a bidirectional LSP needs to follow the same path as
   its forward LSP [RFC6373].  The MPLS Transport Profile (TP) [RFC6370]
   architecture facilitates the co-routed bidirectional LSP by using the
   GMPLS extensions [RFC3473] to achieve congruent paths.  However, the
   RSVP association signaling allows to enable co-routed bidirectional
   LSPs without having to deploy GMPLS extensions in the existing
   networks.  The association signaling also allows to take advantage of
   the existing TE and Fast Reroute (FRR) mechanisms in the network.

   [RFC4090] defines FRR extensions for MPLS TE LSPs and those are also
   applicable to the associated bidirectional LSPs.  [RFC8271] defines
   FRR procedure for GMPLS signaled bidirectional LSPs, such as,
   coordinate bypass tunnel assignments in the forward and reverse
   directions of the LSP.  The mechanisms defined in [RFC8271] are also
   useful for the FRR of associated bidirectional LSPs.

   This document updates the FRR procedures defined in [RFC4090] to
   support both single-sided and double-sided provisioned associated
   bidirectional LSPs.  This document also updates the procedure for
   associating two reverse LSPs defined in [RFC7551] to support
   co-routed bidirectional LSPs.  The FRR procedures can ensure that for
   the co-routed LSPs, traffic flows on co-routed paths in the forward
   and reverse directions after fast reroute.

2.1.  Assumptions and Considerations

   The following assumptions and considerations apply to this document:

   o  The FRR procedure for the unidirectional LSPs is defined in
      [RFC4090] and is not modified by this document.

   o  The FRR procedure when using the unidirectional bypass tunnels is
      defined in [RFC4090] and is not modified by this document.

   o  This document assumes that the FRR bypass tunnels used for
      protected associated bidirectional LSPs are also associated
      bidirectional.

   o  The FRR bypass tunnels used for protected co-routed associated
      bidirectional LSPs are assumed to be co-routed associated
      bidirectional.

   o  The FRR procedure to coordinate the bypass tunnel assignment

      defined in this document may be used for protected non-corouted
      associated bidirectional LSPs but requires that the downstream
      Point of Local Repair (PLR) and Merge Point (MP) pair of the
      forward LSP matches the upstream MP and PLR pair of the reverse
      LSP.

   o  Unless otherwise specified in this document, the fast reroute
      procedures defined in [RFC4090] are used for associated
      bidirectional LSPs.


3.  Problem Statement

   As specified in [RFC7551], in the single-sided provisioning case, the
   RSVP TE tunnel is configured only on one endpoint node of the
   bidirectional LSP.  An LSP for this tunnel is initiated by the
   originating endpoint with (Extended) ASSOCIATION Object containing
   Association Type set to "single-sided associated bidirectional LSP"
   and REVERSE_LSP Object inserted in the RSVP Path message.  The remote
   endpoint then creates the corresponding reverse TE tunnel and signals
   the reverse LSP in response using the information from the
   REVERSE_LSP Object and other objects present in the received RSVP
   Path message.  As specified in [RFC7551], in the double-sided
   provisioning case, the RSVP TE tunnel is configured on both endpoint
   nodes of the bidirectional LSP.  Both forward and reverse LSPs are
   initiated independently by the two endpoints with (Extended)
   ASSOCIATION Object containing Association Type set to "double-sided
   associated bidirectional LSP".  With both single-sided and double-
   sided provisioned bidirectional LSPs, the reverse LSP may or may not
   be congruent (i.e. co-routed) and follow the same path as its forward
   LSP.

   Both single-sided and double-sided associated bidirectional LSPs
   require solutions to the following issues for fast reroute to ensure
   co-routing after a failure event.

3.1.  Fast Reroute Bypass Tunnel Assignment

   In order to ensure that the traffic flows on a co-routed path after a
   link or node failure on the protected co-routed LSP path, the mid-
   point Point of Local Repair (PLR) nodes need to assign matching
   bidirectional bypass tunnels for fast reroute.  Such bypass
   assignment requires coordination between the forward and reverse
   direction PLR nodes when more than one bypass tunnels are present on
   a PLR node.

            Figure 1: Multiple Bidirectional Bypass Tunnels

   As shown in Figure 1, there are two bypass tunnels available, Bypass
   tunnel N (on path B-H-I-C) and Bypass tunnel S (on path B-F-G-C). 
   The mid-point PLR nodes B and C need to coordinate bypass tunnel
   assignment to ensure that traffic in both directions flow through
   either on the Bypass tunnel N or the Bypass tunnel S, after the link
   B-C failure.

3.2.  Node Protection Bypass Tunnels

   When using a node protection bypass tunnel with a protected
   associated bidirectional LSP, after a link failure, the forward and
   reverse LSP traffic can flow on different node protection bypass
   tunnels in the upstream and downstream directions.

                 Figure 2: Node Protection Bypass Tunnels

   As shown in Figure 2, after the link B-C failure, the downstream PLR
   node B reroutes the protected forward LSP1 traffic over the bypass
   tunnel S (on path B-F-G-D) to reach downstream MP node D whereas the
   upstream PLR node C reroute the protected reverse LSP2 traffic over
   the bypass tunnel N (on path C-I-H-A) to reach the upstream MP node
   A.  As a result, the traffic in the forward and revere directions
   flows on different bypass tunnels and this can cause the co-routed
   associated bidirectional LSP to become non-corouted.  However, unlike
   GMPLS LSPs, the asymmetry of paths in the forward and reverse
   directions does not result in RSVP soft-state timeout with the
   associated bidirectional LSPs.

3.3.  Bidirectional LSP Association At Mid-Points

   In packet transport networks, a restoration LSP is signaled after a
   link failure on the protected LSP path and the protected LSP may or
   may not be torn down [RFC8131].  In this case, multiple forward and
   reverse LSPs of a co-routed associated bidirectional LSP may be
   present at mid-point nodes with identical (Extended) ASSOCIATION
   Objects.  This creates an ambiguity at mid-point nodes to identify
   the correct associated LSP pair for fast reroute bypass assignment
   (e.g. during the recovery phase of RSVP graceful restart procedure).

   As shown in Figure 3, the protected LSPs LSP1 and LSP2 are an
   associated LSP pair, similarly the restoration LSPs LSP3 and LSP4 are
   an associated LSP pair, both pairs belong to the same associated
   bidirectional LSP and carry identical (Extended) ASSOCIATION Objects.
    In this example, the mid-point node D may mistakenly associate LSP1
   with the reverse LSP4 instead of the reverse LSP3 due to the matching
   (Extended) ASSOCIATION Objects.  This may cause the co-routed
   associated bidirectional LSP to become non-corouted after fast
   reroute.  Since the bypass assignment needs to be coordinated between
   the forward and reverse LSPs, this can also lead to undesired bypass
   tunnel assignments.


4.  Signaling Procedure

4.1.  Associated Bidirectional LSP Fast Reroute

   For both single-sided and double-sided associated bidirectional LSPs,
   the fast reroute procedure specified in [RFC4090] is used.  In
   addition, the mechanisms defined in [RFC8271] are used as following.

   o  The BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT IPv4 subobject (value: 38) and IPv6
      subobject (value: 39) defined in [RFC8271] are used to coordinate
      bypass tunnel assignment between the forward and reverse direction
      PLR nodes (see Figure 1).  The BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT and Node-ID
      address [RFC4561] subobjects MUST be added by the downstream PLR
      node in the RECORD_ROUTE Object (RRO) of the RSVP Path message of
      the forward LSP to indicate the local bypass tunnel assignment
      using the procedure defined in [RFC8271].  The upstream node uses
      the bypass assignment information (namely, bypass tunnel source
      address, destination address and Tunnel ID) in the received RSVP
      Path message of the protected forward LSP to find the associated
      bypass tunnel in the reverse direction.  The upstream PLR node
      MUST NOT add the BYPASS_ASSIGNMENT subobject in the RRO of the
      RSVP Path message of the reverse LSP.

   o  The downstream PLR node initiates the bypass tunnel assignment for
      the forward LSP.  The upstream PLR (forward direction LSP MP) node
      reflects the associated bypass tunnel assignment for the reverse
      direction LSP.  The upstream PLR node MUST NOT initiate the bypass
      tunnel assignment.

   o  If the indicated forward bypass tunnel or the associated reverse
      bypass tunnel is not found, the upstream PLR SHOULD send a Notify
      message [RFC3473] with Error-code "FRR Bypass Assignment Error"
      (value: 44) and Sub-code "Bypass Tunnel Not Found" (value: 1)
      [RFC8271] to the downstream PLR.

   o  If the bypass tunnel can not be used as described in Section 4.5.3
      in [RFC8271], the upstream PLR SHOULD send a Notify message
      [RFC3473] with Error-code "FRR Bypass Assignment Error" (value:
      44) and Sub-code "Bypass Assignment Cannot Be Used" (value: 0)
      [RFC8271] to the downstream PLR.

   o  After a link or node failure, the PLR nodes in both forward and
      reverse directions trigger fast reroute independently using the
      procedures defined in [RFC4090] and send the forward and protected
      reverse LSP modified RSVP Path messages and traffic over the
      bypass tunnel.  The RSVP Resv signaling of the protected forward
      and reverse LSPs follows the same procedure as defined in
      [RFC4090] and is not modified by this document.

4.1.1.  Restoring Co-routing with Node Protection Bypass Tunnels

   After fast reroute, the downstream MP node assumes the role of
   upstream PLR and reroutes the reverse LSP RSVP Path messages and
   traffic over the bypass tunnel on which the forward LSP RSVP Path
   messages and traffic are received.  This procedure is defined as
   restoring co-routing in [RFC8271].  This procedure is used to ensure
   that both forward and reverse LSP signaling and traffic flow on the
   same bidirectional bypass tunnel after fast reroute.

   As shown in Figure 2, when using a node protection bypass tunnel with
   protected co-routed LSPs, asymmetry of paths can occur in the forward
   and reverse directions after a link failure [RFC8271].  In order to
   restore co-routing, the downstream MP node D (acting as an upstream
   PLR) SHOULD trigger the procedure to restore co-routing and reroute
   the protected reverse LSP2 RSVP Path messages and traffic over the
   bypass tunnel S (on path D-G-F-B) to the upstream MP node B upon
   receiving the protected forward LSP modified RSVP Path messages and
   traffic over the bypass tunnel S (on path D-G-F-B) from node B.  The
   upstream PLR node C stops receiving the RSVP Path messages and
   traffic for the reverse LSP2 from node D (resulting in RSVP
   soft-state timeout) and it stops sending the RSVP Path messages for
   the reverse LSP2 over the bypass tunnel N (on path C-I-H-A) to node
   A.

4.1.2.  Unidirectional Link Failures

   The unidirectional link failures can cause co-routed associated
   bidirectional LSPs to become non-corouted after fast reroute with
   both link protection and node protection bypass tunnels.  However,
   the unidirectional link failures in the upstream and/or downstream
   directions do not result in RSVP soft-state timeout with the
   associated bidirectional LSPs as upstream and downstream PLRs trigger
   fast reroute independently.  The asymmetry of forward and reverse LSP

Internet-Draft   FRR For Associated Bidirectional LSPs   August 28, 2018


   paths due to the unidirectional link failure in the downstream
   direction can be corrected by using the procedure to restore co-
   routing specified in Section 4.1.1.

4.1.3.  Revertive Behavior after Fast Reroute

   When the revertive behavior is desired for a protected LSP after the
   link is restored, the procedure defined in [RFC4090], Section 6.5.2,
   is followed.

   o  The downstream PLR node starts sending the RSVP Path messages and
      traffic flow of the protected forward LSP over the restored link
      and stops sending them over the bypass tunnel [RFC4090].

   o  The upstream PLR node (when the protected LSP is present) also
      starts sending the RSVP Path messages and traffic flow of the
      protected reverse LSPs over the restored link and stops sending
      them over the bypass tunnel [RFC4090].

   o  In case of node protection bypass tunnels (see Figure 2), after
      restoring co-routing, the upstream PLR node D SHOULD start sending
      RSVP Path messages and traffic for the reverse LSP over the
      original link (C-D) when it receives the un-modified RSVP Path
      messages and traffic for the protected forward LSP over it and
      stops sending them over the bypass tunnel S (on path D-G-F-B).

4.1.4.  Bypass Tunnel Provisioning

   Fast reroute bidirectional bypass tunnels can be single-sided or
   double-sided associated tunnels.  For both single-sided and double-
   sided associated bypass tunnels, the fast reroute assignment policies
   need to be configured on the downstream PLR nodes of the protected
   LSPs that initiate the bypass tunnel assignments.  For single-sided
   associated bypass tunnels, these nodes are the originating endpoints
   of their signaling.

4.1.5.  One-to-One Bypass Tunnel

   The fast reroute signaling procedure defined in this document can be
   used for both facility backup described in Section 3.2 of [RFC4090]
   and one-to-one backup described in Section 3.1 of [RFC4090].  As
   described in Section 5.4.2 of [RFC8271], in one-to-one backup method,
   if the associated bidirectional bypass tunnel is already in-use at
   the upstream PLR, it SHOULD send a Notify message [RFC3473] with
   Error-code "FRR Bypass Assignment Error" (value: 44) and Sub-code
   "One-to-One Bypass Already in Use" (value: 2) to the downstream PLR.

4.2.  Bidirectional LSP Association At Mid-points

   In order to associate the LSPs unambiguously at a mid-point node (see
   Figure 3), the endpoint node MUST signal Extended ASSOCIATION Object
   and add unique Extended Association ID for each associated forward
   and reverse LSP pair forming the bidirectional LSP.  An endpoint node
   MAY set the Extended Association ID to the value shown in Appendix A.

   o  For single-sided provisioned bidirectional LSPs [RFC7551], the
      originating endpoint signals the Extended ASSOCIATION Object with
      a unique Extended Association ID.  The remote endpoint copies the
      contents of the received Extended ASSOCIATION Object including the
      Extended Association ID in the RSVP Path message of the reverse
      LSP's Extended ASSOCIATION Object.

   o  For double-sided provisioned bidirectional LSPs [RFC7551], both
      endpoints need to ensure that the bidirectional LSP has a unique
      Extended ASSOCIATION Object for each forward and reverse LSP pair
      by selecting appropriate unique Extended Association IDs signaled
      by them.


5.  Compatibility

   This document updates the procedures for fast reroute for associated
   bidirectional LSPs defined in [RFC4090] and for associating
   bidirectional LSPs defined in [RFC7551].  The procedures use the
   signaling messages defined in [RFC8271] and no new signaling messages
   are defined in this document.  The procedures ensure that for the co-
   routed LSPs, traffic flows on co-routed paths in the forward and
   reverse directions after fast reroute.  Operators wishing to use this
   function SHOULD ensure that it is supported on all the nodes on the
   LSP path.  The nodes not supporting this function can cause the
   traffic to flow on asymmetric paths in the forward and reverse
   directions of the associated bidirectional LSPs after fast reroute.


6.  Security Considerations

   This document updates the signaling mechanisms defined in [RFC4090]
   and [RFC7551]; and does not introduce any additional security
   considerations other than those already covered in [RFC4090],
   [RFC7551], [RFC8271], and the MPLS/GMPLS security framework
   [RFC5920].


7.  IANA Considerations
