Internet-Draft           POP3 Support for UTF-8             January 2007


1.  Introduction

   This specification extends POP3 [RFC1939] using the POP3 Extension
   Mechanism [RFC2449] to permit un-encoded UTF-8 [RFC3629] in headers
   as described in Internationalized Email Headers [I-D.ietf-eai-
   utf8headers].  It also adds a mechanism to support login names
   outside the US-ASCII character set, and a mechanism to support UTF-8
   protocol-level error strings in a language appropriate for the user.

   Within this specification, the term up-conversion refers to
   converting a traditional 7-bit Internet message [RFC2822] with
   Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text [RFC2047] and other
   7-bit encodings to a message with internationalized headers
   [I-D.ietf-eai-utf8headers] and minimal use of 7-bit encodings.  Down-
   conversion refers to the inverse process.  One mechanism to perform
   down-conversion is described by Downgrading mechanism for
   Internationalized eMail Address [I-D.ietf-eai-downgrade].

1.1.  Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY"
   in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for
   use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [RFC2119].

   The formal syntax use the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC4234]
   notation including the core rules defined in Appendix B of RFC 4234.

   In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
   server respectively.  If a single "C:" or "S:" label applies to
   multiple lines, then the line breaks between those lines are for
   editorial clarity only and are not part of the actual protocol
   exchange.

1.2.  Change History

   This section describes the change history of this Internet draft and
   will be removed when/if this is published as an RFC.

1.2.1.  Changes from draft-ietf-eai-pop-00.txt

   o  Update references

1.2.2.  Changes from draft-newman-ima-pop

   o  Change title to make this a WG document.

   o  Add LANG command and extension.

   o  Rename RET8 capability to UTF8 and add sub-sections for arguments.

   o  Add TOP8 command.

   o  Add definition of up-conversion and down-conversion.

   o  Some grammar fix-ups and section re-ordering based on RFC editor
      style.

1.3.  Open Issues

   The decision on how to handle UTF-8 in Received headers will impact
   the up-conversion requirements section.

   Should we make POP up-convert requirements match the IMAP up-convert
   requirements?  The current POP requirements encourage but do not
   require a MIME parser on the server or final delivery agent.  The
   current IMAP up-conversion requirements do require a MIME parser
   (since IMAP already requires one).

   Need a reference for up-conversion of message/rfc822 body part.

Internet-Draft           POP3 Support for UTF-8             January 2007


   Discussion:

   POP3 allows most +OK and -ERR server responses to include human-
   readable text that in some cases needs to be presented to the user.
   But that text is limited to US-ASCII by the POP3 specification
   [RFC1939].  The LANG capability and command permit a POP3 client to
   negotiate which language the server should use when sending human-
   readable text.

   A server that advertises the LANG extension MUST use the language
   "i-default" as described in [RFC2277] as its default language until
   another supported language is negotiated by the client.  A server
   MUST include "i-default" as one of its supported languages.

   The LANG command requests that human-readable text included in all
   subsequent +OK and -ERR responses be localized to a language matching
   the language range argument as described by section 2.5 of [RFC3066].
   If the command succeeds, the server returns a +OK response followed
   by a single space, the exact RFC 3066 language tag selected, another
   space, and the rest of the line is human-readable text in the
   appropriate language.  This and subsequent protocol-level human
   readable text is encoded in the UTF-8 charset.

   If the command fails, the server returns a -ERR response and
   subsequent human-readable response text continues to use the language
   that was previously active (typically i-default).

   The client MUST NOT use MUL (Multiple languages) or UND
   (Undetermined) language tags and the server MUST return -ERR if
   either tag is used.  The special "*" language range argument
   indicates a request to use a language designated as preferred by the
   server administrator.  The preferred language MAY vary based on the
   currently active user.

   If no argument was given and the POP3 server issues a positive
   response, then the response given is multi-line.  After the initial
   +OK, for each language tag the server supports, the POP3 server
   responds with a line for that language.  This line is called a
   "language listing".

   In order to simplify parsing, all POP3 servers are required to use a
   certain format for language listings.  A language listing consists of
   the RFC 3066 language tag of the message, optionally followed by a
   single space and a human readable description of that language using
   the UTF-8 charset.

3.  UTF8 Capability

   CAPA tag:
      UTF8

   Arguments:
      USER, LST8, TOP8

   Added Commands:
      RET8, LST8, TOP8

   Standard commands affected:
      USER, PASS, APOP

   Announced states / possible differences:
      both / no

   Commands valid in states:
      TRANSACTION

   Specification reference:
      this document

   Discussion:

   This capability adds UTF-8 content support to POP3.  This capability
   always adds the "RET8" command to POP3.  The RET8 command is
   identical to the RETR command, except that the retrieved message uses
   internationalized headers [I-D.ietf-eai-utf8headers].  In addition,
   the 8bit content-transfer-encoding as defined in MIME section 2.8
   [RFC2045] is explicitly permitted.  The retrieved message MUST still
   be textual and otherwise formatted according to RFC 2822 [RFC2822]
   and MIME [RFC2045].  The MIME binary content-transfer-encoding is not
   permitted.  Clients wishing to use binary MIME should implement IMAP4
   [RFC3501] with the IMAP4 Binary Content Extension [RFC3516].

3.1.  USER Argument to UTF8 Capability

   If the USER argument is included with this capability, that indicates
   the server accepts UTF-8 user names and passwords and applies
   SASLprep [RFC4013] to the arguments of the USER, PASS and APOP
   commands.  A client that supports APOP and permits UTF-8 in user
   names or passwords MUST also implement SASLprep [RFC4013] on the user
   name and password used to compute the APOP digest.

3.2.  LST8 Argument to UTF8 Capability

   If the LST8 argument is included with this capability, that indicates

Internet-Draft           POP3 Support for UTF-8             January 2007


   the server implements the LST8 command.  The LST8 command is
   identical to the LIST command except that the octet counts are the
   exact octet counts returned by the RET8 command.  A POP3 client that
   uses RET8 MUST use LST8 instead of LIST if LST8 is advertised.

3.3.  TOP8 Argument to UTF8 Capability

   If the TOP8 argument is included with this capability, that indicates
   the server implements the TOP8 command.  TOP8 is identical to TOP,
   except the headers are UTF-8.


4.  NO-RETR Capability

   CAPA tag:
      NO-RETR

   Arguments:
      none

   Added Commands:
      none

   Standard commands affected:
      RETR, LIST, TOP

   Announced states / possible differences:
      both / no

   Commands valid in states:
      N/A

   Specification reference:
      this document

   Discussion:

   This capability permits a POP3 server to advertise that it does not
   support the RETR, LIST or TOP commands.  Any attempt to use any of
   these three commands results in an error response.  As this is an
   incompatible change to POP3, a clear warning is necessary.  POP3
   clients that find implementation of the UTF8 capability problematic
   are encouraged to at least detect the NO-RETR capability and provide
   an informative error message to the end-user.

   When a POP3 server runs on a UTF-8 header native mail drop, the down-
   conversion step necessary to implement RETR in a backwards compatible
   fashion becomes more difficult to support.  Although it is hoped



Newman                    Expires July 29, 2007                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           POP3 Support for UTF-8             January 2007


   deployed POP3 servers do not advertise NO-RETR for some years, this
   capability is intended to minimize the disruption when legacy support
   finally goes away.

   A server that advertises NO-RETR MUST advertise UTF8 with at least
   the LST8 argument and MUST NOT advertise TOP.


5.  Up-Conversion Server Requirements

   When a POP3 server uses a traditional mail drop that supports only
   7-bit headers, it MUST support message header up-conversion for the
   RET8, LST8, and TOP8 commands.  As POP3 clients are best when simple,
   the more up-conversion the server performs, the better.  Minimal up-
   conversion is described in this section.

   The server MUST support up-conversion of the following address
   header-fields in the message header: From, Sender, To, CC, Bcc,
   Resent-From, Resent-Sender, Resent-To, Resent-CC, Resent-Bcc, and
   Reply-To.  This up-conversion MUST include address local-parts
   encoded according to [TBD], address domains encoded according to IDNA
   [RFC3490], and MIME header encoding [RFC2047] of display-names and
   any RFC 2822 comments.

   The following charsets MUST be supported for up-conversion of MIME
   header encoding [RFC2047]: UTF-8, US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2,
   ISO-8859-3, ISO-8859-4, ISO-8859-5, ISO-8859-6, ISO-8859-7,
   ISO-8859-8, ISO-8859-9, ISO-8859-10, ISO-8859-14, and ISO-8859-15.
   Other widely deployed MIME charsets SHOULD be supported.

   Up-conversion of MIME header encoding of the following headers MUST
   also be implemented: Subject, Date (RFC 2822 comments only),
   Comments, Keywords, Content-Description.

   While this specification does not require it, server implementations
   are encouraged to up-convert all MIME body headers, and particularly
   the deprecated (and misused) name parameter [RFC1341] on Content-Type
   and the Content-Disposition [RFC2183] filename parameter.  These may
   be encoded using the standard MIME parameter encoding [RFC2231]
   mechanism, or via non-standard use of MIME header encoding [RFC2047]
   in quoted strings.

   Servers are also encouraged to up-convert the headers on embedded
   message/rfc822 body parts [TBD-ref].  Servers MAY convert the charset
   on MIME body parts to UTF-8, and MAY remove quoted-printable or
   base64 encodings as long as the resulting text complies with the
   requirements of the 8-bit content-transfer-encoding [RFC2045].

Internet-Draft           POP3 Support for UTF-8             January 2007


   The POP3 server MUST NOT perform up-conversion of headers and content
   of multipart/signed [RFC1847], as well as Original-Recipient and
   Return-Path.


6.  Issues with UTF-8 Header Mail Drop

   When a POP3 server uses a mail drop that supports UTF-8 headers and
   it does not advertise the NO-RETR capability, it is the
   responsibility of the server to comply with the POP3 base
   specification [RFC1939] and RFC 2822 [RFC2822] with respect to the
   RETR, LIST, and TOP commands.  Mechanisms for 7-bit downgrading to
   help comply with the standards are discussed in Downgrading mechanism
   for Internationalized eMail Address (IMA) [I-D.ietf-eai-downgrade].

   A POP3 server with a mail drop that supports UTF-8 headers MUST
   comply with the RET8 protocol requirements implicit from Section 5.
   However, the code necessary for such compliance need not be part of
   the POP3 server itself in this case.  For example, the minimal
   required up-conversion could be performed when a message is inserted
   into the POP3-accessible mail drop.


7.  IANA Considerations

   This adds three new capabilities ("UTF8", "LANG", and "NO-RETR") to
   the POP3 capability registry [RFC2449].


8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of UTF-8 [RFC3629] and SASLprep [RFC4013]
   apply to this specification, particularly with respect to use of
   UTF-8 in user names and passwords.

   The "LANG *" command can reveal the existence and preferred language
   of a user to an active attacker probing the system if the active
   language changes in response to the USER, PASS, or APOP commands
   prior to validating the user's credentials.  Servers MUST implement a
   configuration to prevent this exposure.

   It is possible for a man-in-the-middle attacker to insert a LANG
   command in the command stream thus making protocol-level diagnostic
   responses unintelligible to the user.  A mechanism to integrity
   protect the session, such as TLS [RFC2595] can be used to defeat such
   attacks.

Appendix A.  Design Rationale

   This non-normative section discusses the reasons behind some of the
   design choices in the above specification.

   The basic approach of advertising a parallel command set and
   permitting graceful migration of both client and server with minimal
   disruption is a deliberate choice.  While a mechanism that makes RETR
   "just-send-UTF-8" might deploy faster, it would also create
   interoperability problems.  The approach used prevents

   interoperability problems until the NO-RETR mechanism is deployed.  A
   client command to cause a model switch could also work, but the
   parallel command approach is cleaner given the small number of
   commands.

   The choice to make RET8 nearly identical to RETR is important to
   minimize the code changes necessary in a client.  An alternative
   approach that permits binary MIME and uses a length-counted argument
   would be architecturally superior but is dismissed due to the
   migration problems it would cause.  The IMAP4 Binary extension should
   be sufficient for cases where binary MIME support is deemed
   necessary.

   LST8 is optional to minimize the cost of deploying UTF-8 support on a
   legacy mail drop.  The server load necessary to perform up-conversion
   on every message in the mail drop to determine the LST8 octet-counts
   would be prohibitively expensive when there's no way to cache those
   counts.  The octet counts from the LIST command should be close
   enough to the RET8 size for most POP3 user interfaces, and robust
   POP3 clients already have to deal with LIST octet counts that don't
   match the actual size of the RETR result.

   USER is optional because the implementation burden of SASLprep
   [RFC4013] is not well understood and mandating such support in all
   cases could negatively impact deployment.

   The NO-RETR mechanism simplifies diagnosis of interoperability
   problems when legacy support goes away.  In the situation where
   backwards compatibility is broken anyway, just-send-8 RETR has the
   advantage that it might work with some legacy clients.  However, the
   difficulty of diagnosing interoperability problems caused by a just-
   send-8 RETR mechanism is the reason the NO-RETR mechanism was chosen.

   The up-conversion requirements are designed to balance the desire to
   deprecate and eventually eliminate complicated encodings (like MIME
   header encodings) without creating a significant deployment burden
   for servers.  While it would be desirable to require up-conversion of
   attachment file names, the erroneous perception that MIME parsing is
   difficult in combination with multiple deployed mechanisms for such
   file names tip the balance.

   Due to interoperability problems with RFC 2047 and limited deployment
   of RFC 2231, it is hoped these 7-bit encoding mechanisms can be
   deprecated in the future when UTF-8 header support becomes prevalent.
   Aggressive conversion of these encodings to UTF-8 will help simplify
   the infrastructure and improve interoperability in the future.

   The set of mandatory charsets comes from two sources: MIME

   requirements [RFC2049] and IETF Policy on Character Sets [RFC2277].
   Including a requirement to up-convert widely deployed encoded
   ideographic charsets to UTF-8 would be reasonable for most scenarios,
   but may require unacceptable table sizes for some embedded devices.
   The open-ended recommendation to support widely deployed charsets
   avoids the political ramifications of attempting to list such
   charsets.  The author believes market forces, existing open-source
   software, and public conversion tables are sufficient to deploy the
   appropriate charsets.  Specifically, use of an open-source charset
   conversion library (such as ICU) is likely sufficient to fulfill this
   recommendation.

   While it is possible to provide useful examples for language
   negotiation without support for non-ASCII characters, it is difficult
   to provide useful examples for commands specifically designed to use
   the UTF-8 charset un-encoded when the document format is limited to
   US-ASCII.  As a result, there are no plans to provide examples for
   that part of the specification as long as this remains an
   experimental proposal.  However, implementers of this specification
   are encouraged to provide examples to the document author for a
   future revision.

   This was deliberately written so the down-conversion specification is
   not a normative reference.  While this specification does reiterate
   the requirements of the base POP3 specification with respect to
   message format, no specific mechanism to achieve those requirements
   is mandated.
