                     DHCP Option Number for iSNS        February 2002


Abstract

   This document describes the DHCP option to allow iSNS clients
   devices using DHCP to automatically discover the location of the
   iSNS server. iSNS provides discovery and management capabilities for
   iSCSI and Fibre Channel (FCP) storage devices in an enterprise-scale
   IP storage network.  iSNS provides intelligent storage management
   services comparable to those found in Fibre Channel networks,
   allowing a commodity IP network to function in a similar capacity as
   a storage area network.

Conventions used in this document

   iSNS refers to the framework consisting of the storage network model
   and associated services.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   All frame formats are in big endian network byte order.  RESERVED
   fields SHOULD be set to zero.

   This document uses the following terms:

   "iSNS Client" - iSNS clients are processes resident in iSCSI and
   iFCP devices that initiate transactions with the iSNS server using
   the iSNS Protocol.

   "iSNS Server" - The iSNS server responds to iSNS protocol query and
   registration messages, and initiates asynchronous notification
   messages.  The iSNS server stores information registered by iSNS
   clients.

   "iSCSI (Internet SCSI)" - iSCSI is an encapsulation of SCSI for a
   new generation of storage devices interconnected with TCP/IP.

   "iFCP (Internet Fibre Channel Protocol)" - iFCP is a gateway-to-
   gateway protocol designed to interconnect existing Fibre Channel and
   SCSI devices using TCP/IP.  iFCP maps the existing FCP standard and
   associated Fibre Channel services to TCP/IP.

1.       Introduction

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol provides a framework for
   passing configuration information to hosts.  Its usefulness extends
   to hosts and devices using the iSCSI and iFCP protocols to connect
   to block level storage assets over a TCP/IP network.

   The iSNS Protocol provides a framework for automated discovery,
   management, and configuration of iSCSI and iFCP devices on a TCP/IP
   network.  It provides functionality similar to that found on Fibre
   Channel networks, except that iSNS works within the context of an IP

   network.  iSNS thereby provides the requisite storage intelligence
   to IP networks that are standard on existing Fibre Channel networks.

   Existing DHCP option numbers are not plausible due to the following
   reasons:

   1)  iSNS functionality is distinctly different from other protocols
   using existing DHCP option numbers.  Specifically, iSNS provides a
   significant superset of capabilities compared to typical name
   resolution protocols such as DNS.  It is designed to support client
   devices that allow themselves to be configured and managed from a
   central iSNS server.

   2)  iSNS requires a DHCP option format that provides more than the
   location of the iSNS server.  The DHCP option number needs to
   specify the subset of iSNS services that will be actively used by
   the iSNS client.

   The DHCP option number for iSNS is used by iSCSI and iFCP devices to
   discover the location and role of the iSNS server.  The DHCP option
   number assigned for iSNS by IANA is <<TBD>>.

2.       iSNS Option for DHCP

   This option specifies the location of the primary and backup iSNS
   servers and the subset of iSNS services that will be used by the
   iSNS client.

   The iSNS Option specifies a list of IP addresses used by iSNS
   servers.

   Length indicates the number of bytes that follow the Length field.
   The minimum value for the Length field is 2 in order to account for
   the FLAGS field.

   The format of the FLAGS field is shown below:

   Heartbeat:  Indicates whether the first IP address is the multicast
   address for the iSNS heartbeat message.  If enabled, then a1-a4
   contains the heartbeat multicast address and b1-b4 contains the IP
   address of the primary iSNS server, followed by the IP address(es)
   of any backup servers.  If disabled, then a1-a4 contains the IP
   address of the primary iSNS server, followed by the IP address(es)
   of any backup servers.

   Authorization:  Indicates the role of the iSNS server in determining
   device access authorizations.  If disabled, then the role of the
   iSNS server is only for discovery purposes only.  Discovery Domains
   MAY be used to manage the discovery process, but they do not
   indicate necessarily indicate authorization to access discovered
   devices.  If enabled, then Discovery Domain/Zoning features of the
   iSNS indicate device access authorizations.  Devices in a common DD
   SHALL be allowed access to each other if they are successfully
   authenticated.  Devices not in a common DD shall not be allowed to
   access each other.

   Security:  Indicates whether the iSNS client is to download and use
   the security policy configuration stored in the iSNS server.  If
   enabled, then the AuthMethod and IKE/IPSec policy stored in the iSNS
   server SHALL be used by the iSNS client for its own security policy.
   If disabled, then the iSNS client SHALL NOT query for its own
   security policy attributes in the iSNS server.

   Site-Specific:  These bits are used to indicate site-specific or
   vendor-specific capabilities in the indicated iSNS server.

3.       Security Considerations

   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security mechanisms.
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP
   protocol specification [DHCP].

   iSNS security considerations are discussed in [iSNS] and [SEC-IPS].
