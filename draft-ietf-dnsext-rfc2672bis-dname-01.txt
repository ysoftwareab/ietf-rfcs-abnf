Abstract

   The DNAME record provides redirection for a sub-tree of the domain
   name tree in the DNS system.  That is, all names that end with a
   particular suffix are redirected to another part of the DNS.  This is
   an update to the original specification in RFC 2672.

Internet-Draft              DNAME Redirection               January 2007


1.  Introduction

   DNAME is a DNS Resource Record type.  DNAME provides redirection from
   a part of the DNS name tree to another part of the DNS name tree.

   For example, given a query for foo.example.com and a DNAME from
   example.com to example.net, the query would be redirected to
   foo.example.net.  With the same DNAME a query for foo.bar.example.com
   is redirected to foo.bar.example.net.

   The DNAME RR is similar to the CNAME RR in that it provides
   redirection.  But where the CNAME RR only provides redirection for
   exactly one name, the DNAME RR provides redirection for all names in
   a sub-tree of the DNS name tree.

   This document is an update to the original specification of DNAME in
   RFC 2672 [RFC2672], by Matt Crawford.  DNAME was conceived to help
   with the problem of maintaining address-to-name mappings in a context
   of network renumbering.  So that with a careful set-up a renumbering
   event in the network causes no change to the authoritative server
   that has the address-to-name mappings.

   Other usage of DNAME lies in redirection of name spaces.  Where a
   zone administrator want subtrees of the DNS to contain the same
   information.  Examples in practice are classless reverse address
   space delegations and punycode alternates for domain spaces.  DNAME
   is also used for redirection of ENUM domains to another maintaining
   party.

   This update to DNAME does not change the wire format, or the handling
   of DNAME Resource Records by existing software.  Discussion is added
   on the problems that can be encountered when using DNAME.

2.  The DNAME Resource Record

2.1.  Format

   The DNAME RR has mnemonic DNAME and type code 39 (decimal).

   The format of the DNAME record has not changed compared to RFC 2672.
   DNAME has the following format:

           <owner> <ttl> <class> DNAME <target>

   The format is not class-sensitive.  All fields are required.  The
   RDATA field target is a domain-name.  The RDATA field target name
   MUST be sent uncompressed [RFC3597].

Internet-Draft              DNAME Redirection               January 2007


   The DNAME RR causes type NS additional section processing.

2.2.  The DNAME Substitution

   DNAMEs cause a name substitution to happen to query names.  This is
   called The DNAME Substitution.  The suffix ownername of the DNAME is
   replaced by the target of the DNAME.  The owner name of the DNAME is
   not itself redirected, only domain names below the owner name are
   redirected.  Only whole labels are replaced.  A name is considered
   below the owner name if it has more labels than the owner name, and
   the labels of the owner name appear at the end of the name.  See the
   table of examples for common cases and corner cases.

   In the table below, the QNAME refers to the query name.  The owner is
   the DNAME owner domain name, and the target refers to the target of
   the DNAME record.  The result is the resulting name of performing the
   DNAME Substitution on the query name. "no match" means that the query
   did not match the DNAME and thus no substitution is performed, the
   QNAME did not change.  The examples 'cyc' and 'shortloop' contain
   loops.

    QNAME            owner  DNAME   target         result
    ---------------- -------------- -------------- -----------------
    com.             example.com.   example.net.   <no match>
    example.com.     example.com.   example.net.   <no match>
    a.example.com.   example.com.   example.net.   a.example.net.
    a.b.example.com. example.com.   example.net.   a.b.example.net.
    ab.example.com.  b.example.com. example.net.   <no match>
    foo.example.com. example.com.   example.net.   foo.example.net.
    a.x.example.com. x.example.com. example.net.   a.example.net.
    a.example.com.   example.com.   y.example.net. a.y.example.net.
    cyc.example.com. example.com.   example.com.   cyc.example.com.
    cyc.example.com. example.com.   c.example.com. cyc.c.example.com.
    shortloop.x.x.   x.             .              shortloop.x.
    shortloop.x.     x.             .              shortloop.

                    Table. DNAME Substitution Examples.

   It is possible for DNAMEs to form loops.  Just like CNAMEs can form
   loops.  DNAMEs and CNAMEs can chain together to form loops.  A single
   corner case DNAME can form a loop.  Resolvers and servers should be
   cautious in devoting resources to a query, but be aware that fairly
   long chains of DNAMEs may be valid.

   The domain name can get too long during substitution.  If this occurs
   the server returns an RCODE of YXDOMAIN [RFC2136].  The DNAME record
   and its signature are included in the answer as proof for the
   YXDOMAIN (value 6) RCODE.

2.3.  Names next-to and below a DNAME record

   Other resource records MUST NOT exist below a DNAME.  To get the
   contents for names below a DNAME, the DNAME redirection must be
   invoked and the resulting target queried.  A server SHOULD refuse to
   load a zone that has data below a domain with a DNAME resource
   record.  Also a server SHOULD refuse to load a zone beneath a DNAME
   record from another zone.

   DNAME is a singleton type, only one DNAME is allowed per name.  The
   owner name that has a DNAME, can only have one DNAME RR, and no CNAME
   RRs can exist at that name.  These rules make sure that for a single
   domain name only one redirection exists, and thus no confusion which
   one to follow.  A server SHOULD refuse to load a zone that violates
   these rules.

   These rules allow DNAME records to be queried through DNAME unaware
   caches.

2.4.  Compression of the DNAME record.

   The DNAME owner name can be compressed like any other owner name.
   The target DNAME RDATA name of MUST NOT be sent out in compressed
   form, so that DNAME can be treated as an unknown type.

   Although the previous specification talked about signaling to allow
   compression of the target name, no such signaling is done.  Signaling
   complicates the protocol unnecessarily.

   RFC2672 claimed that the EDNS version had a meaning for understanding
   of DNAME and DNAME target name compression.  This document updates
   RFC2672, there is no EDNS version signaling for DNAME.

3.  Processing

3.1.  Wildcards

   The use of DNAME in conjunction with wildcards is discouraged
   [RFC4592].  Thus records of the form "*.example.com DNAME
   example.net" SHOULD NOT be used.

   The interaction between the expansion of the wildcard and the
   redirection of the DNAME is non-deterministic.  Because the
   processing is non-deterministic, DNSSEC validating resolvers may not
   be able to validate a wildcarded DNAME.

   A server MAY give a warning that the behaviour is unspecified if such
   a wildcarded DNAME is loaded.

Internet-Draft              DNAME Redirection               January 2007


3.2.  DNAME bit in NSEC type map

   When a validator checks the NSEC RRs returned on a name error
   response, it SHOULD check that the DNAME bit is not set.  If the
   DNAME bit is set then the DNAME substitution should have been done,
   but has not.  In the same vein, for a no error/no data response the
   CNAME bit in the NSEC RR bitmap should not be set.

3.3.  CNAME synthesis

   On the server side, the DNAME RR record is always included in the
   answer section of a query.  A CNAME RR record with TTL 0 is
   synthesized for old resolvers, specifically for the QNAME in the
   query.  DNSSEC [RFC4033], [RFC4034], [RFC4035] says that the
   synthesized CNAME does not have to be signed.  The DNAME has an RRSIG
   and a validating resolver can check the CNAME against the DNAME
   record and validate the DNAME record.

   The TTL of the synthesized CNAME record MAY be set to the TTL of the
   DNAME record.  This enables older caches store the CNAMEs without a
   need to re-query for them.  This updates RFC2672 which stated the TTL
   had to be zero.

   It does not make sense for the authoritative server to follow the
   chain of DNAMEs, CNAMEs and wildcards outside of the zone of the
   query, as modern resolvers will remove out-of-zone information from
   the answer.

   The EDNS DNSSEC-OK bit signals understanding of the DNAME record
   [RFC4034].  If set, the synthesized CNAME MAY be omitted, since it is
   not signed and therefore not useful for validation and a waste of
   bandwidth.  This is a change from RFC2672, which specified CNAMEs had
   to be synthesized for all EDNS0, or non-extended queries.

   Resolvers MUST be able to handle a synthesized CNAME TTL of zero or
   equal to the TTL of the corresponding DNAME record.  The TTL of zero
   means that the CNAME can be discarded immediately after processing
   the answer.

   Servers MUST be able to answer a query for a synthesized CNAME.  An
   answer containing the synthesized CNAME cannot contain an error
   (since a CNAME has been followed), as per RFC 1034 CNAME rules.

3.4.  Processing

   TBD: An issue with some firewalls and middleboxes, and perhaps
   windows XP/2003 resolvers potentially responding badly to DNAME
   records (dropping packets),

Internet-Draft              DNAME Redirection               January 2007


   TBD: Is this useful to specify?  Resolvers MUST be able to handle
   unsigned responses with only the CNAME, or with the DNAME only, or
   both CNAME and DNAME.  Resolvers that query with DNSSEC_OK MUST be
   able to handle signed responses with only the DNAME, or with the
   unsigned synthesized CNAME included.

   Caches MUST NOT allow data to be cached below a DNAME.  Except CNAME
   records or perhaps NSEC3 records and their signatures.  CNAME records
   below a DNAME MUST be re-synthesized from the DNAME, or checked
   against the DNAME record before sending them out.  This improves
   consistency of the DNAME and CNAME records below it.

4.  DNAME Discussions in Other Documents

   In [RFC2181], in Section 10.3., the discussion on MX and NS records
   touches on redirection by CNAMEs, but this also holds for DNAMEs.

   Excerpt from 10.3.  MX and NS records (in RFC 2181).

           The domain name used as the value of a NS resource record,
           or part of the value of a MX resource record must not be
           an alias.  Not only is the specification clear on this
           point, but using an alias in either of these positions
           neither works as well as might be hoped, nor well fulfills
           the ambition that may have led to this approach.  This
           domain name must have as its value one or more address
           records.  Currently those will be A records, however in
           the future other record types giving addressing
           information may be acceptable.  It can also have other
           RRs, but never a CNAME RR.

   RFC 4592 [RFC4592] says that DNAMEs are discouraged at wildcards.
   DNAMEs and CNAMEs can form loops.

   DNAME is discussed in RFC 3363, section 4, on A6 and DNAME.  DNAME is
   NOT RECOMMENDED for use in the IPv66 reverse tree [RFC3363].  And
   from [RFC4294], all references to DNAME should have been removed.
   There needs to be a better clarification of the status of DNAME in
   RFC 3363 which would be to drop all constraints on having DNAME RRs
   in these zones.

5.  Issues with DNAME

   There are several issues to be aware of about the use of DNAME.

Internet-Draft              DNAME Redirection               January 2007


5.1.  DNAME Apex not Redirected itself

   The owner name of a DNAME is not redirected itself.  The reason for
   the original decision was that in this way (without DNAME owner
   affected) one can have a DNAME at the zone apex, next to the SOA, NS
   records, without problem.  Then use this to point queries to this
   zone to other zones.  Hosting two identical zones for example, there
   still is a need to duplicate the resource records at the zone apex.
   Another reason for excluding the DNAME owner from the DNAME
   substitution is that one can then query for the DNAME through RFC
   1034 [RFC1034] caches.

   This means that DNAME does not mirror a zone completely, as it does
   not mirror the zone apex.  It can be used if the zone apex records
   are duplicated to provide a summary of the rest of the zone.

   The rules on DNAME RRs mean that it is not allowed at the same domain
   name as NS records unless there is also a SOA record there.  This
   means DNAME RRs are not allowed at the parent side of a delegation
   point.  DNAME is allowed at a zone apex.

5.2.  MX, NS and PTR Records Must Point to Target of DNAME

   The names listed as target names of MX, NS and PTR records must be
   canonical hostnames.  This means no CNAME or DNAME redirection may be
   present during DNS lookup of the address records for the host.  This
   is discussed in RFC 2181 [RFC2181], section 10.3, and RFC 1912
   [RFC1912], section 2.4.

   The upshot of this is that although the lookup of a PTR record can
   involve DNAMEs, the name listed in the PTR record can not fall under
   a DNAME.  The same holds for NS and MX records.  For example, when
   punycode alternates for a zone use DNAME then the NS, MX and PTR
   records that point to that zone must use names without punycode in
   their RDATA.  What must be done then is to have the domain names with
   DNAME substitution already applied to it as the MX, NS, PTR data.
   These are valid canonical hostnames.

5.3.  NSEC3 and DNAME

   NSEC3 records and their signatures are allowed to exist below a
   DNAME.  This is because of the nature of NSEC3 RRs in DNSSEC, which
   creates hashed owner names that exist below the apex.  This is an
   exception to the rule that there MUST NOT be any other RRs under a
   DNAME RR, if the DNAME RR exists at the zone apex.

   TBD: This is a new issue, but the same as the NSEC3 draft.

Internet-Draft              DNAME Redirection               January 2007


   Queries for NSEC3 owner names are redirected as if there were no such
   NSEC3 present.

   There is no significant extra hashing cost for NSEC3 signed zones
   when answering queries with DNAME substitution.

5.4.  Validators Must Understand DNAME

   Examples of why DNSSEC validators MUST understand DNAME.

5.4.1.  DNAME in Bitmap Causes Invalid Name Error

   ;; Header: QR AA DO RCODE=3(NXDOMAIN)
   ;; Question
   foo.bar.example.com. IN A
   ;; Answer
   bar.example.com. NSEC dub.example.com. A DNAME
   bar.example.com. RRSIG NSEC [valid signature]

   If you receive this answer, then only by understanding that the DNAME
   bit means that foo.bar.example.com needed to have been redirected by
   the DNAME, the validator can see that it is a BOGUS reply from an
   attacker, that collated existing records from the DNS to create a
   confusing reply.

   If the DNAME bit had not been set in the NSEC record above, then the
   answer would have validated as a correct name error response.

5.4.2.  Valid Name Error Response Involving DNAME in Bitmap

   ;; Header: QR AA DO RCODE=3(NXDOMAIN)
   ;; Question
   cee.example.com. IN A
   ;; Answer
   bar.example.com. NSEC dub.example.com. A DNAME
   bar.example.com. RRSIG NSEC [valid signature]

   If the query had been cee.example.com as shown above, then this
   answer would have been validated, because 'cee' does not get
   redirected by the DNAME at 'bar'.

5.4.3.  Response With Synthesized CNAME

Internet-Draft              DNAME Redirection               January 2007


   ;; Header: QR AA DO RCODE=0(NOERROR)
   ;; Question
   foo.bar.example.com. IN A
   ;; Answer
   bar.example.com. DNAME bar.example.net.
   bar.example.com. RRSIG DNAME [valid signature]
   foo.bar.example.com. CNAME foo.bar.example.net.

   The answer shown above has the synthesized CNAME included.  However,
   the CNAME has no signature, since the server cannot sign the keys
   online (it is a slow operation and exposes the signing key).  So it
   cannot be trusted.  It could be altered by an attacker to be
   foo.bar.example.com CNAME bla.bla.example.  The DNAME record does
   have its signature included, since it does not change for every query
   name.  The validator must verify the DNAME signature and then
   recursively resolve further to query for the foo.bar.example.net A
   record.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The main purpose of this draft is to discuss issues related to the
   use of DNAME RRs in a DNS zone.  The original document registered the
   DNAME Resource Record type code 39 (decimal).  No further action is
   required on the part of IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   DNAME redirects queries elsewhere, which may impact security based on
   policy and the security status of the zone with the DNAME and the
   redirection zone's security status.

   If a validating resolver accepts wildcarded DNAMEs, this creates
   security issues.  Since the processing of a wildcarded DNAME is non-
   deterministic and the CNAME that was substituted by the server has no
   signature, the resolver may choose a different result than what the
   server meant, and consequently end up at the wrong destination.  Use
   of wildcarded DNAMEs is discouraged in any case [RFC4592].

   A validating resolver MUST understand DNAME, according to [RFC4034].
   In Section 5.4 examples are given that illustrate this need.  These
   examples are shown with NSEC records, but similar cases exist for
   NSEC3.
