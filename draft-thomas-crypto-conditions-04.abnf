cost = preimage length

cost = prefix.length (in bytes) + max_message_length + subcondition_cost + 1024
cost = (sum of largest F.threshold subcondition.cost values) + 1024 * F.subconditions.count

   For example, if a threshold crypto-condition contains 5 sub-
   conditions with costs of 64, 64, 82, 84 and 84 and has a threshold of
   3, the cost is equal to the sum of the largest three sub-condition
   costs (82 + 84 + 84 = 250) plus 1024 times the number of sub-
   conditions (1024 * 5 = 5120): 5370

cost = (modulus size in bytes) ^ 2

cost = 131072
