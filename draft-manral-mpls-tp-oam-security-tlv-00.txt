Internet-Draft           Authentication TLV for ACH           December 2009



Abstract

   This document defines a new generalized authentication TLV, to be used 
   in the ACH header RFC5586 [2]. This can be used for both the MPLS and 
   MPLS-TP networks.
    




  

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
   in RFC 2119 [1].


1. Introduction

   The Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) has been defined as a
   generalization of the pseudowire (PW) associated control channel to
   enable the realization of a control/communication channel associated
   with Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs), MPLS PWs, MPLS LSP segments, and MPLS sections between
   adjacent MPLS-capable devices.

   The G-ACH header is defined in [RFC5586] to augent maintainance 
   functions in MPLS networks especially when they are used for 
   packet transport services and transport network operations. 
   Examples of these functions include performance monitoring, 
   automatic protection switching, and support for management and 
   signaling communication channels.

   The OAM requirements document states that

    "OAM messages MAY be authenticated to prove their origin and
     to make sure that they are destined for the receiving node".

   This document describes a generic way to provide origin 
   authentication of application packets by defining a new G-ACH TLV.

2. Procedures 

   The location of the ACH Authentication TLV in the ACH header is 
   shown. The TLV can be located anywhere in the ACH TLV header 
   (preceded or proceded by other).

   This is similar to the BFD Authentication defined in [3]. This section
   will be filled in a future version of the draft.
   
   Different applications based on the Channel type may process the ACH
   Authentication TLV. Each document which defines the channel type 
   needs to define the behavior on processing the same (optional/
   mandatory) and the required action.

   An application not supporting data origin authentication can use 
   this mechanism for the purpose instead of defining its own proprietery
   mechanism.

3. Example Application

   [IEEE 802.1ag] and [ITU-T Y.1731] define OAM PDU's and procedures
   for Ethernet OAM. However they do not provide any data origin 
   authentication mechanism.
   
   The OAM extensions [4] use the mechanism for MPLS-TP networks. However
   no origin authentiction mechanism to is defined. The ACH Authentication
   TLV can be used for the purpose.


4.  Security Considerations

   The extensions defined in this document allows an application using the
   ACH header to provide data origin authentication. This can improve the 
   security of packets in the network.

5.  IANA Considerations

   ACH TLV type field for the G-ACH TLV header is required. 

   IANA is requested to allocate the TLV type 
    
    xxxx    Generic Security TLV.

6.  Acknowledgements

   TBD.
