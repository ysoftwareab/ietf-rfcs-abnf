Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology              August 2006


1.  Introduction

   The term "VoIP Peering" has historically been used to describe a wide
   variety of aspects pertaining to the interconnection of service
   provider networks and to the delivery of SIP call termination over
   those interconnections.  The discussion of these interconnections has
   at times been confused by the fact that the term "peering" is used in
   various contexts to relate to interconnection at different levels in
   a protocol stack.  Session Peering for Multimedia Interconnect
   focuses on how to identify and route real-time sessions (such as VoIP
   calls) at the application layer, and it does not (necessarily)
   involve the exchange of packet routing data or media sessions.  In
   particular, "layer 5 network" is used here to refer to the
   interconnection between SIP servers, as opposed to interconnection at
   the IP layer ("layer 3").  Finally, the terms "peering" and
   "interconnect" are used interchangeably throughout this document.

   This document introduces standard terminology for use in
   characterizing real-time session interconnection.  Note however, that
   while this document is primarily targeted at the VoIP interconnect
   case, the terminology described here is applicable to those cases in
   which service providers interconnect using SIP signaling for real-
   time or quasi-real-time communications.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows: Section 2
   provides the general context for the SPEERMINT Working Group.
   Section 3 provides the general definitions for real-time SIP based
   communication, with initial focus on the VoIP interconnect case, and
   Section 5 briefly touches on terms from the ENUM Working Group.
   Finally, Section 6 introduces the concept of federations.


2.  SPEERMINT Context

   Figure 1 depicts the general VoIP interconnect context.  In the case
   shown here, an E.164 number [ITU.E164.1991] is used as a key by ENUM
   to retrieve a NAPTR record [RFC3404] from the DNS, which in turn
   resolved into a SIP URI.  Call routing is based on the resulting SIP
   URI.  The call routing step does not depend on the presence of an
   E.164 number; indeed, the resulting SIP URI may no longer even
   contain any numbers, and the SIP URI can be advertised in various
   other ways, such as on a web page.

                  Figure 1: Session Interconnect Context

   The ENUM Working Group is primarily concerned with the acquisition of
   Call Routing Data, or CRD (i.e., above the double line in Figure 1),
   while the SPEERMINT Working Group is focused on the use of such CRD.
   Importantly, the CRD can be derived from ENUM (i.e., an E.164 DNS
   entry), or via any other mechanism available to the user.


3.  General Definitions

3.1.  Call Routing Data

   Call Routing Data, or CRD, is a SIP URI used to route a call (real-
   time, voice or other type) to the called domain's ingress point.  A
   domain's ingress point can be thought of as the location pointed to
   by the SRV record that resulted from the resolution of the CRD (i.e.,
   a SIP URI).

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology              August 2006


3.2.  Call Routing

   Call routing is the set of processes, rules, and CRD used to route a
   call to its proper (SIP) destination.  More generally, call routing
   can be thought of as the set of processes, rules and CRD which are
   used to route a real-time session to its termination (ingress) point.

3.3.  PSTN

   The term "PSTN" refers to the Public Switched Telephone Network.  In
   particular, the PSTN refers to the collection of interconnected
   circuit-switched voice-oriented public telephone networks, both
   commercial and government-owned.  In general, PSTN terminals are
   addressed using E.164 numbers, noting that various dial-plans (such
   as emergency services dial-plans) may not directly use E.164 numbers.

3.4.  Network

   For purposes of this document and the SPEERMINT and ENUM Working
   Groups, a network is defined to be the set of SIP servers and end-
   users (customers) that are controlled by a single administrative
   domain and can be reached via layer 3 (IP) peering.  The network may
   also contain end-users who are located on the PSTN, as long as they
   are also reachable via layer 3 (IP) peering.

3.5.  Service Provider (SP)

   A Service Provider (or SP) is defined to be an entity that controls a
   "network" as defined in Section 3.4, and provides transport of SIP
   signaling and media packets.

3.6.  Voice Service Provider (VSP)

   A Voice Service Provider (or VSP) is an entity that provides
   transport of SIP signaling (and possibly media streams) to its
   customers.  Such a service provider may additionally be
   interconnected with other service providers; that is, it may "peer"
   with other service providers.  A VSP may also interconnect with the
   PSTN.

   Note that as soon as a ingress point is advertised via a SRV record,
   anyone can find that ingress point and hence can send calls there.
   This is very similar to sending mail to a SMTP server based on the
   existence of a MX record.

   Finally, note the concept of a VSP is a subset of the possible SP
   types.  That is, a VSP is an SP, but it is not necessary that an SP
   be a VSP.

4.  Peering

   While the precise definition of the term "peering" is the subject of
   considerable debate, peering in general refers to the negotiation of
   reciprocal interconnection arrangements, settlement-free or
   otherwise, between operationally independent service providers.

   This document distinguishes two types of peering, Layer 3 Peering and
   Layer 5 peering, which are described below.

4.1.  Layer 3 Peering

   Layer 3 peering refers to interconnection of two service providers
   for the purposes of exchanging IP packets which destined for one (or
   both) of the peer's networks.  Layer 3 peering is generally agnostic
   to the IP payload, and is frequently achieved using a routing
   protocol such as BGP [RFC1771] to exchange the required routing
   information.

   An alternate, perhaps more operational definition of layer 3 peering
   is that two peers exchange only customer routes, and hence any
   traffic between peers terminates on one of the peer's network.

4.2.  Layer 5 (Session) Peering

   Layer 5 (Session) peering refers to interconnection of two service
   providers for the purposes of routing real-time (or quasi-real time)
   secure call signaling between their respective customers using SIP
   methods.  Such interconnection may be direct or indirect (see
   Section 4.3 and Section 4.4 below).  Note that media streams
   associated with this signaling (if any) are not constrained to follow
   the same set of paths.

4.3.  Direct Peering

   Direct peering describes those cases in which two domains
   interconnect without using an intervening layer 5 network.  Both
   domains must have a trust relationship established (for example, they
   may know they belong to the same federation; see Section 6 below)
   before opening up a secure layer 5 communication path.

4.4.  Indirect (Transit) Peering

   Indirect (transit) peering refers to the establishment of a secure
   signaling path via one (or more) referral or transit network(s).  In
   this case it is required that a trust relationship is established
   between the originating domain and the transit network on one side,
   and the transit network and the termination network on the other

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology              August 2006


   side.  Both trust relationships must exist before opening up a secure
   communication path on L5.


5.  ENUM

   ENUM [RFC3761] defines how the Domain Name System (DNS) can be used
   for identifying available services connected to one E.164 number.

5.1.  Carrier of Record

   For purposes of this document, "Carrier of Record", or COR, refers to
   the entity to which an E.164 number has been assigned to (or ported
   to).  More specifically, the COR can be defined can defined as
   follows [I-D.ietf-enum-infrastructure-enum-reqs]:

   o  If the number in question has not been ported, then the COR is the
      Service Provider to which the E.164 number was allocated for end
      user assignment (either the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) or
      the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) makes these
      assignments), or

   o  If the number has been ported, the COR is the service provider to
      which the number was ported, or

   o  If the number is assigned directly to end users, the COR is the
      service provider that the end user number assignee has chosen to
      provide a Public Switched Telephone Network/Public Land Mobile
      Network (PSTN/PLMN) point-of-interconnect for the number.

   Finally, note that the exact definition of who and what is a COR is
   ultimately the responsibility of the relevant NRA.

5.2.  User ENUM

   User ENUM is generally defined as the set of administrative policies
   and procedures surrounding the use of the e164.arpa domain for
   Telephone Number to URI resolution [RFC3761].  In the User ENUM case,
   the entity (or person) having the right to use a number has control
   the content of the associated domain and thus the zone content (at
   the very least, there is local control over the content of the zone).
   From a domain registration perspective, the end user number assignee
   is thus the registrant [I-D.ietf-enum-infrastructure-enum-reqs].

   Policies and procedures for the registration of telephone numbers
   within all branches of the e164.arpa tree are Nation State issues by
   agreement with the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and ITU.
   National Regulatory Authorities have generally defined User ENUM



Meyer                   Expires February 8, 2007                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology              August 2006


   Registrants as the E.164 number holder as opposed to the COR that
   issued the phone number.

5.3.  Infrastructure ENUM

   Infrastructure ENUM (I-ENUM) is generally regarded as the use of a
   separate branch the e164.arpa tree, such as ie164.arpa to permit
   service providers to exchange phone number to URI data in order to
   find points of interconnection.  The current theory of Infrastructure
   ENUM is that only the COR for a particular E.164 number is permitted
   to provision data for that E.164 within that portion of the e164.arpa
   tree.

   In infrastructure ENUM, only the COR may enter data in the
   corresponding domain.  The COR may also enter CRD (i.e., a SIP URI)
   to allow other SPs to to route sessions to its network.

   Finally, note that ENUM is not constrained to carry only data (CDR)
   as defined by SPEERMINT.  In particular, an important class of CRD,
   the tel URIs [RFC3966] may be carried in ENUM.  Such tel URIs are
   most frequently used to interconnect with the PSTN directly, and are
   out of scope for SPEERMINT.  On the other hand, PSTN endpoints served
   by a COR and reachable via CDR and networks as defined in Section 3.1
   and Section 3.4 are in scope for SPEERMINT.


6.  Federations

   The domain policy DDDS application [I-D.lendl-domain-policy-ddds]
   defines a method with which a domain owner can announce the policy it
   will use to accept incoming calls.  This section introduces a policy
   type for use with that framework, known as federations
   [I-D.lendl-speermint-federations].

   Note that [I-D.lendl-domain-policy-ddds] does not define what these
   rules can be or how they might be communicated to the members of a
   federation.  Further, there is no requirement that such rules are in
   any way public.

   Briefly, a federation is a group of SPs which agree:

      *  To receive calls from each other via SIP,

      *  On a set of administrative rules for such calls (settlement,
         abuse-handling, ...), and

      *  On specific rules for the technical details of the
         interconnection.

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology              August 2006


6.1.  Federation Functionality

   A federation may provide some or all of the following functionality:

      *  Common policies

         +  Policy might be ah-hoc, and published in the DNS (e.g.,
            [I-D.lendl-domain-policy-ddds], or

         +  Policy might also be managed by a federation entity

      *  A federated ENUM root

      *  Address resolution mechanisms

      *  Session signaling (via federation policy)

      *  Media streams (via federation policy)

      *  Federation security policies

      *  Interconnection policies

      *  Other layer 2 and layer 3 policies

   Finally, note that a SP can be a member of

      *  No federation (e.g., the SP has only bilateral peering
         agreements)

      *  A single federation

      *  Multiple federations

   and an SP can have any combination of bi-lateral and multi-lateral
   (i.e., federated) interconnections.

6.2.  Announcement of Federation Membership

   Announcement of federation membership is typically made by the
   terminating SP, using one or more of the following mechanisms:

      *  I-ENUM

      *  A Private ENUM Federation discovery mechanism

      *  DNS

Internet-Draft            SPEERMINT Terminology              August 2006


6.3.  Example Federation Rules

   Example federation rules might include the following:

   o  A set of SPs form an association and agree to accept calls from
      each other via the public Internet as long as the SIP call uses
      TCP/TLS as transport protocol and presents a X.509 cert which was
      signed by the association's own CA.

   o  A set of SPs build a L3 network dedicated to VoIP peering (e.g.,
      the 3GPP GRX).  The further agree to accept calls from all
      participants in that network and bill each other via a
      clearinghouse.

   o  A set of SPs agree to accept calls originating from within the
      same country.  They use a set of firewall rules to block calls
      from abroad.

   o  A company sets up a SIP proxy which acts as a forwarding proxy
      between the SIP proxies of all participating SPs.  The group of
      these SP form a federation whose technical rules state that calls
      have to be routed via that central proxy.


7.  Acknowledgments

   Many of the definitions were gleaned from detailed discussions on the
   SPEERMINT, ENUM, and SIPPING mailing lists.  Scott Brim, Eli Katz,
   Mike Hammer, Gaurav Kulshreshtha, Jason Livingood, Jean-Francois
   Mule, David Schwartz, Richard Shockey, Henry Sinnreich, Richard
   Stastny, Dan Wing, and Adam Uzelac all made valuable contributions to
   early versions of this document.  Patrik Faltstrom also made many
   insightful comments to early versions of this draft, and contributed
   the basis of Figure 1.


8.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations.  However, it
   is important to note that Session interconnect, as described in this
   document, has a wide variety of security issues that should be
   considered in documents addressing both protocol and use case
   analyzes.


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates no new requirements on IANA namespaces
