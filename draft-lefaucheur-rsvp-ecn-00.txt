Specification of Requirements 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]. 
    
    
1.  Introduction 
    
   [RSVP] defines the Resource reSerVation Protocol which can be used by 
   applications to request resources from the network. The network 
   responds by explicitely admitting or rejecting these RSVP requests. 
   Certain applications that have quantifiable resource requirements 
   express these requirements using Intserv parameters as defined in the 
   appropriate Intserv service specifications ([GUARANTEED], 
   [CONTROLLED]). 
    
   [CL-ARCH] describes a framework to achieve a Controlled Load (CL) 
   service by using distributed measurement-based admission control 
   edge-to-edge, i.e. within a particular region of the Internet. The 
   measurement made is of CL packets that have their Congestion 
   Experienced (CE) codepoint set as they travel across the edge-to-edge 
   region. Setting the CE codepoint, which is under the control of a new 
   Pre-congestion Marking behaviour, provides an "early warning" of 
   potential congestion. This information is used by the ingress node of 
   the edge-to-edge region to decide whether to admit a new CL microflow. 
     
   [CL-ARCH] also describes how the framework uses rate-based pre-
   emption to maintain the CL service to as many admitted microflows as 
   possible even after localised failure and routing changes in the 
   interior of the edge-to-edge region. 
    
   The edge-to-edge architecture of [CL-ARCH] is a building block in 
   delivering an end-to-end CL service. The approach is similar to that 
   described in [INTSERV-DIFFERV] for Integrated services operation over 
   Diffserv networks. Like [INTSERV-DIFFERV], an IntServ class (CL in 
   our case) is achieved end-to-end, with a CL-region viewed as a single 
   reservation hop in the total end-to-end path. Interior nodes of the 
   CL-region do not process flow signalling nor do they hold state. [CL-
   ARCH] assumes that the end-to-end signalling mechanism is RSVP.

   This document specifies the extensions to RSVP for support of the 
   Controlled Load (CL) service over a Diffserv cloud using Pre-
   Congestion Notification as defined in [CL-ARCH]. 
     
    
1.1. Changes from previous versions 
    
      - This is the initial version of the document 
       
    
2.  Definitions 
    
   For readability, a number of definitions from [CL-ARCH] are repeated 
   here: 
    
      o Ingress Edge: a node which is an ingress gateway to the CL-
   region. A CL-region may have several ingress nodes.   
    
      o Egress Edge: a node which is an egress gateway from the CL-
   region. A CL-region may have several egress nodes.  
    
      o Interior node: a node which is part of the CL-region, but isn't 
   an Ingress or Egress Edge.  
    
      o CL-region: A region of the Internet in which all nodes run the 
   Pre-Congestion Ntofication scheme defined in [CL-MARKING] and where 
   all traffic enters/leaves through an Ingress/Egress  
   Edge. A CL-region is a DiffServ region (either a single  
   DiffServ domain or set of contiguous DiffServ domains.  
    
      o Congestion-Level-Estimate: the bits in CL packets that have the 
   Congestion Experienced (CE) codepoint set, divided by the bits in all 
   CL packets. It is calculated as an exponentially weighted moving 
   average. It is calculated by an egress node for CL packets from a 
   particular ingress node.

3.2.  Overview of Procedures for Admission Control of New Reservations 
    
   As mentioned earlier, [CL-ARCH] describes a framework to achieve a 
   Controlled Load (CL) service by using distributed measurement-based 
   admission control edge-to-edge, i.e. within a particular region of 
   the Internet. This section describes RSVP operations to support such 
   an admission control scheme relying on Pre-Congestion Notification in 
   the eddge-to-edge region. 
    
   When a new Path message is received by Ingress Edge, the Ingress Edge 
   does regular RSVP processing and forwards the Path towards 
   destination.  
    
   All the ECN-capable Interior nodes are not RSVP-capable and thus 
   simply ignore the Path message. 
    
   When the Path message arrives at the Egress Edge, the Egress Edge 
   processes it as per regular RSVP processing augmented with the 
   following rules: 
      1) The Egress Edge does NOT perform the RSVP-TTL vs IP TTL-check 
         and does NOT update the ADspec Break bit. This is because the 
         whole CL-region is effectively handled by RSVP as a virtual 
         "link" on which Integrated Service is indeed supported (and 
         admission control performed) so that the Break bit MUST not be 
         set.  
      2) As an option, the Egress Edge may check, at the time of 
         initial Path processing, whether it has a valid value for the 
         corresponding Congestion-Level-Estimate and if not it may send 
         a PathErr message to the Ingress Edge with "CL-ECN Probes 
         Required" Error Code. This minimizes call set up time as it 
         allows probes to be generated by the Ingress Edge and measured 
         by the Egress Edge while the Path is traveling towards the 
         receiver and while the Resv travels back from the receiver. 
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                          [Page 4] 

                      RSVP Extensions for CL-ECN         October 2005 
 
 
   Then the Ingress Edge forwards the Path message towards the receiver. 
    
   [Editor Note: discussion on Adspec update to be added] 
    
   When the Resv message is received by the Egress Edge (from the 
   downstream side), the Egress Edge performs regular RSVP processing 
   (including performing admission control for the segment downstream of 
   the Egress Edge) augmented with the procedures described in this 
   section.  
    
   The Egress Edge MUST include the new CL-ECN object in the Resv 
   message transmitted to the RSVP P_HOP (which is the Ingress Edge). 
   The CL-ECN object MUST convey the current Pre-Congestion Notification 
   Congestion-Level-Estimate as measured by the Egress Edge from the 
   corresponding Ingress Edge to itself. Details for computing the 
   Congestion-Level-estimate can be found in [CL-ARCH] and [CL-MARKING]. 
    
   If the Egress Edge does not have a current value for the Congestion-
   Level-estimate for the corresponding Ingress Edge (because there was 
   no traffic received by the Egress Edge from that Ingress Edge) and it 
   has not already requested the Ingress Edge to generate probes, the 
   Egress Edge: 
      1) triggers a timer and puts the Resv message processing on hold 
      2) sends a PathErr message towards the Ingress Edge with the new 
         Error Code of "CL-ECN Probes Required" specified in this 
         document, in order to instruct the Ingress Edge to generate 
         the necessary probe traffic to enable the Egress Edge to 
         compute the Congestion-Level-Estimate from that Ingress Edge 
      3) When timer expires the Resv processing resumes. Assuming the 
         Congestion-Level-Estimate is now available, the Egress Edge 
         can include it in the CL-ECN object and complete Resv 
         processing. If the Congestion-Level-Estimate is still 
         available, the Egress Edge may loop again a few times through 
         step 1) and 2). After a given number of times, the Egress Edge 
         MUST send a ResvErr towards the receiver with ErrorCode 
         "Admission Control Failure" 
    
   [Editor note: approach in previous paragraph may be revisited to try 
   avoid having to "put Resv message processing on hold".] 
    
   The Egress Edge will then forward the Resv message to the PHOP 
   signaled earlier in the Path message and which identifies the Ingress 
   Edge. Since the Resv message is directly addressed to the Ingress 
   Edge and does not carry the Router Alert option (as per regular RSVP 
   Resv procedures), the Resv message is hidden from the Interior nodes 
   which handle the E2E Resv message as a regular IP packet. 
    
   When receiving the Resv message, the Ingress Edge processes the Resv 
   message as per regular RSVP with the following exceptions: 
 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                          [Page 5] 

                      RSVP Extensions for CL-ECN         October 2005 
 
 
      1) if the CL-ECN object is absent from the Resv message, this 
         means that the RSVP Next Hop is not CL-ECN capable and hence 
         proper admission control can not be achieved for that 
         reservation over the ECN cloud. Thus, the Ingress Edge MUST 
         send a ResvErr message towards the receiver with Error Code 
         "Inconsistent Admission Control Behaviour across Ingress and 
         Egress Edge" and an Error Value of "Egress Edge Router not CL-
         ECN capable". The Ingress Edge MAY also generate an alarm to 
         the network operator. 
         Note that in the case where the RSVP Next Hop is not CL-ECN 
         capable, this RSVP hop would have (most probably) performed 
         the RSVP-TTL vs IP-TTL check when processing the initial Path 
         message and as a result would have set the Break bit in the 
         Adspec (assuming there is at least one Interior node on the 
         path from the Ingress Edge to the RSVP Next Hop). Thus, the 
         sender would already have been notified in the first place 
         that the QoS could not be guaranteed end-to-end. 
      2) The Ingress Edge MUST carry out the admission control decision 
         (for admission of the reservation over the path from Ingress 
         Edge to Egress Edge through the ECN cloud) taking into account 
         the congestion information provided in the CL-ECN object of 
         the Resv message in accordance with the procedures of [CL-
         ARCH] and [CL-MARKING] (for example, if the Congestion Level 
         Estimate conveyed in the CL-ECN object exceeds a configured 
         threshold, the Ingress Edge may decide to reject this new 
         reservation). Once the admission control decision is taken by 
         the Ingress Edge, regular RSVP procedures are followed to 
         either proceed with the reservation (and forward the Resv 
         towards the sender) or tear down the reservation (and, in 
         particular, send a ResvErr towards the receiver with Error 
         Code "Admission Control failure". 
      3) In case the Ingress Edge forwards the Resv message upstream, 
         the Ingress Edge MUST remove the CL-ECN object [Editor Note: 
         discuss RSVP Authentication] 
    
    
   When generating a refresh for a Resv message towards the Ingress Edge, 
   the Egress Edge SHOULD NOT include the current value of the 
   Congestion-Level-Estimate in the CL-ECN object, but rather SHOULD 
   include the value which was included in the previous refresh. This is 
   for implementation reasons, to facilitate detection by the Ingress 
   Edge that this message is a mere refresh even if the value of the 
   actual Congestion-Level-Estimate has changed since the previous 
   refresh.  
    
   When receiving a PathErr message with the new Error Code of "CL-ECN 
   Probes Required", the Ingress Edge MUST generate CL-ECN probes as 
   described in [CL-ARCH] and [CL-MARKING] towards the Egress Edge which 

 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                          [Page 6] 

                      RSVP Extensions for CL-ECN         October 2005 
 
 
   sent the PathErr Message, and MUST not propagate the PathErr message 
   further upstream. 
    
 
3.3.  Removal of E2E reservations  
    
   E2E reservations are removed in the usual RSVP way via PathTear, 
   ResvTear, timeout, or as the result of an error condition. This does 
   not directly affect CL-ECN operations. 
    
    
3.4.  Overview of Procedures for Preemption of Existing Reservations 
    
   As mentioned earlier, [CL-ARCH] describes how the framework uses 
   rate-based pre-emption to maintain the CL service to as many admitted 
   microflows as possible even after localised failure and routing 
   changes in the interior of the edge-to-edge region. The solution has 
   two aspects. First, triggering the Ingress Edge that pre-emption may 
   be needed. This involves a new router marking behaviour for Alert 
   Notification. Secondly, calculating the right amount of traffic to 
   drop. This involves the Egress Edge measuring the amount of CL 
   traffic from a particular ingress gateway. The Ingress edge compares 
   this measurement (which is the amount that the network can actually 
   support) with the rate that it is sending.  
    
   This section describes RSVP operations for support of such preemption. 
    
   Section 3.2.1 "Alerting the Ingress Edge that pre-emption may be 
   needed" specifies how the Egress Edge can be alerted, explicitly or 
   implicitly, that preemption may be needed and specifies how the 
   Egress Edge measures the rate of traffic at the Egress Edge for the 
   relevant CL-region-aggregate. It also specifies that the Egress Edge 
   needs to transport this information reliably to the Ingress Edge. 
    
   Let us assume that a number of reservations are established and 
   transit through a given Ingress Edge Ei and a given Egress Edge Ee. 
   Let us now assume that Ee is alerted that preemption may be needed 
   and that Ee has measured the egress rate for the CL-region-aggregate 
   from Ei to Ee. 
    
   Then, Ee MUST arbitrarily select one of the reservations whose 
   Previous Hop is Ei and address to Ei a Resv message for that 
   reservation with a CL-ECN object containing the current Egress Rate 
   for the relevant CL-region-aggregate. 
    
   To avoid the risk that this Resv message gets lost and in turn that 
   the Ingress Edge is not made aware in a timely manner that the 
   Congestion-Level-Estimate has changed significantly, the RSVP 

 
 
Le Faucheur, et al.                                          [Page 7] 

                      RSVP Extensions for CL-ECN         October 2005 
 
 
   reliable messaging procedures specified in [RSVP-REFRESH] SHOULD be 
   used. 
    
   Note that, even when reliable messaging is used, there is a very 
   small risk that the information about significant change of 
   Congestion-Level-estimate does not make it to the Ingress Edge. For 
   example, this could happen because there could be a race condition 
   whereby the corresponding reservation may get torn down around the 
   same time where the Resv message with the CL-ECN object is 
   transmitted, resulting in the Ingress Edge ignoring the whole Resv 
   message. However, this appears very unlikely and could also be 
   mitigated by the Egress Edge sending the new Congestion-Level-
   Estimate on more than one reservation.  
    
   [Editor Note: optional use of a Notify message will be investigated.  
   Can this solve the race condition problem mentioned above?] 
    
   On receipt of the Resv message Ei will detect that this message is 
   not just a refresh because the content of the CL-ECN object has 
   changed and will immediately trigger its admission control logic. 
   This will assess whether some reservations need to be dropped in 
   accordance with the [CL-ARCH] and [CL-MARKING] scheme. In case some 
   do, those will be torn down as per regular RSVP procedures (in 
   particular a ResvErr message is then sent to the receiver).

   The CL-ECN Object may only be used in Resv messages. 
    
   Let us refer: 
      - to the Egress Edge which generated the Resv message containing 
        the CL-ECN object as Ee

      - to the RSVP Previous HOP (Ingres Edge) for the corresponding 
        reservation as Ei. 
    
   CL-ECN Congestion-Level-Estimate: 
   This contains the current value of the Congestion-Level-Estimate 
   (defined in [CL-ARCH] and [CL- MARKING]) computed by Ee for traffic 
   from Ei to Ee  
   [Editor Note: Encoding details to be added] 
    
   Preemption Egress Rate: 
   This contains: 
      - When Ee is not alerted that preemption is needed for traffic 
        from Ei to Ee, this field is set to 0,  
      - When Ee is alerted that preemption is needed for traffic from 
        Ei to Ee, the current value of the rate of traffic at the 
        Egress Edge for the relevant CL-region-aggregate (defined in 
        [CL-ARCH] and [CL-MARKING]) computed by Ee for traffic from Ei 
        to Ee 
   [Editor Note: Encoding details to be added] 
    
    
4.2.  "CL-ECN Probes Required" Error Code 
    
   The "CL-ECN Probes Required" Error Code may appear only in PathErr 
   messages. 
    
   Error Code = To be allocated by IANA 
    
    
4.3.  "Inconsistent Admission Control Behaviour across Ingress and 
    Egress Edge" Error Code 
    
   The "Inconsistent Admission Control Behaviour across Ingress and 
   Egress Edge" may appear only in ResvErr messages. 
   [Editor note: should we allow it in PathErr messages too so that 
   notification can also be provided to the sender?] 
    
   Error Code for "Inconsistent Admission Control Behaviour across 
   Ingress and Egress Edge"= To be allocated by IANA 
    
   Error Value for "Egress Edge Router not CL-ECN capable"= To be 
   allocated by IANA

6.  IANA Considerations  
    
   This document makes the following requests to the IANA: 
      - allocate a new Object Class (CL-ECN Object) 
      - allocate a new Error Code ("CL-ECN Probes Required") and manage 
   the corresponding Error Value range 
      - allocate a new Error Code ("Inconsistent Admission Control 
   Behaviour across Ingress and Egress Edge") and manage the 
   corresponding Error Value range
