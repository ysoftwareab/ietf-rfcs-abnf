Internet-Draft                 SIEVE-XMPP                  December 2005


1.  Introduction

1.1  Overview

   [SIEVE-NOTIFY] defines a [SIEVE] extension for instant notifications
   to be generated when a new message has arrived in an email inbox.  In
   particular, [SIEVE-NOTIFY] defines the "notify" action but does not
   specify which technology or technologies to use for such
   notifications; instead, it leaves the definition of specific
   notification methods up to "profiles" of [SIEVE-NOTIFY].  This
   document defines one such profile, for the Extensible Messaging and
   Presence Protocol (XMPP) as defined in [XMPP].

1.2  Terminology

   This document inherits terminology from [SIEVE], [SIEVE-NOTIFY], and
   [XMPP].

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [TERMS].

2.  Definition

   In order to send Sieve notifications to an XMPP entity, the format of
   the notify action shall be as follows:

   o  The ":method" tag MUST be specified and its value MUST be a URI
      that conforms to the xmpp URI scheme (as specified in [XMPP-URI])
      and that identifies an XMPP account associated with the email
      inbox.
   o  The ":id" tag MAY be specified.
   o  The ":priority" tag MAY be specified.
   o  The ":message" tag MAY be specified.

   The notify action SHOULD be mapped to XMPP elements and attributes as
   follows:

   o  The notification MUST be an XMPP <message/> stanza.
   o  The value of the ":id" tag SHOULD NOT be translated into XMPP
      syntax.
   o  The value of the ":priority" tag MAY be translated into XMPP
      syntax; if it is so translated, it SHOULD be encapsulated as the
      value of an [XMPP-SHIM] header named "Priority" and its value
      SHOULD be consistent with [RFC1327] (namely, "normal", "non-
      urgent", or "urgent").

   o  The value of the ":message" tag MUST be translated into the XML
      character data of the XMPP <message/> stanza's <body/> child
      element.
   o  The value of the XMPP <message/> stanza's 'type' attribute SHOULD
      be "normal" (or not included since "normal" is the default value)
      but MAY be "headline".
   o  The value of the XMPP <message/> stanza's 'to' attribute MUST be
      the XMPP address that is extracted from the ":method" tag in
      accordance with the processing rules specified in [XMPP-URI].
   o  The value of the XMPP <message/> stanza's 'from' attribute MUST be
      the XMPP address of the notification service.
   o  The XMPP <message/> stanza MAY include a <subject/> child element
      whose value is either the ":subject" tag or, absent that, some
      configurable text indicating that the message is a Sieve instant
      notification.

3.  Example

   Consider the following Sieve notify action:

   notify :method "xmpp:romeo@example.com"
          :id "some-id"
          :priority "high"
          :message "<juliet@example.org> Wherefore art thou?";

   The resulting XMPP <message/> stanza might be as follows:

   <message from='notify.example.com'
            to='romeo@example.com'
            xml:lang='en'>
     <subject>A Sieve instant notification!</subject>
     <body>&lt;juliet@example.org&gt; Wherefore art thou?</body>
     <headers xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/shim'>
       <header name='Priority'>urgent</header>
     </headers>
   </message>


4.  Internationalization Considerations

   Although an XMPP address may contain nearly any [UNICODE] character,
   the value of the ":method" tag MUST be a Uniform Resource Identifier
   (see [URI] rather than an Internationalized Resource Identifier (see
   [IRI]).  The rules specified in [XMPP-URI] MUST be followed when
   generating XMPP URIs.

5.  Security Considerations

   Detailed security considerations for the relevant protocols profiled
   in this document are given in [SIEVE], [SIEVE-NOTIFY], and [XMPP];
   this document introduces no new security concerns above and beyond
   those described in the foregoing specifications.
