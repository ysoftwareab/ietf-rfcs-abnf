1.  Introduction

     Previous work on internet EDI focussed on specifying MIME content
     types for EDI data ([2] RFC 1767).  This Applicability Statement
     expands on RFC 1767 to specify use of a comprehensive set of data
     security features, specifically data privacy, data
     integrity/authenticity, non-repudiation of origin and non-repudiation
     of receipt.  This draft recognizes contemporary RFCs and internet
     drafts and is attempting to "re-invent" as little as possible.
     
     With an enhancements in the area of "receipts", as described below
     (3.1.8), secure internet MIME based EDI can be accomplished by using
     and complying with the following RFC's and drafts:

        -RFC 821 SMTP
        -RFC 822 Text Message Formats
        -RFC 1521 MIME
        -RFC 1767 EDI Content Type
        -RFC 1847 Security Multiparts for MIME
        -RFC 1892 Multipart/Report
        -Internet draft: Message Disposition Notification (fajman)
        -RFC 2015 MIME/PGP (elkins)
        -S/MIME Specification (RSA)

     Our intent here is to define clearly and precisely how these
     are pieced together and what is required by user agents to be
     compliant with this Applicability Statement.


2.   Overview

2.1  Purpose of a security guideline for MIME EDI

     The purpose of these specifications is to ensure interoperability
     between EDI user agents, invoking some or all of the commonly
     expected security features. This standard is also NOT limited to
     strict EDI use, but applies to any electronic commerce application
     where business data needs to be exchanged over the internet in a
     secure manner.


2.2 Definitions

    2.2.1. Terms

    EDI                    Electronic Data Interchange

    EC                     Electronic Commerce

    Receipt                The functional message that is sent from a
                           receiver to a sender to acknowledge receipt
                           of an EDI/EC interchange

    Signed Receipt         Same as above, but with a digital signature
