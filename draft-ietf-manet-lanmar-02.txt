Abstract

   The Landmark Routing Protocol (LANMAR) utilizes the concept of 
   "landmark" for scalable routing in large, mobile ad hoc networks.  
   It relies on the notion of group mobility: i.e., a logical group 
   (for example a team of coworkers at a convention) moves in a

   coordinated fashion.  The existence of such logical group can be 
   efficiently reflected in the addressing scheme.  It assumes that 
   an IP like address is used consisting of a group ID (or subnet ID)
   and a host ID, i.e. <Group ID, Host ID>.  A landmark is dynamically
   elected in each group.  The route to a landmark is propagated 
   throughout the network using a Distance Vector mechanism.  
   Separately, each node in the network uses a "scoped" routing 
   algorithm (e.g., FSR) to learn about routes within a given (max 
   number of hops) scope.  To route a packet to a destination outside
   its scope, a node will direct the packet to the landmark 
   corresponding to the group ID of such destination.  Once the packet
   is within the scope of the landmark, it will typically be routed 
   directly to the destination.  Remote groups of nodes are 
   "summarized" by the corresponding landmarks.  The solution to 
   drifters (i.e., nodes outside of the scope of their landmark) is 
   also handled by LANMAR.  Landmark dynamic election enables LANMAR 
   to cope with mobile environments.  Thus, by using the truncated 
   local routing table and the "summarized" landmark distance vector, 
   LANMAR dramatically reduces routing table size and update overhead
   in large nets.  LANMAR is well suited to provide an efficient and 
   scalable routing solution in large, mobile, ad hoc environments in
   which group behavior applies and high mobility renders traditional 
   routing schemes inefficient.

1. Introduction                                                     

   This document describes the Landmark Routing Protocol (LANMAR) [1,2]
   developed by the Wireless Adaptive Mobility (WAM) Laboratory [4] at
   Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles.

   The concept of landmark routing was first introduced in wired area 
   networks [6].  The original scheme required predefined multi-level 
   hierarchical addressing.  The hierarchical address of each node 
   reflects its position within the hierarchy and helps to find a route
   to it.  Each node knows the routes to all the nodes within its 
   hierarchical partition.  Moreover, each node knows the routes to 
   various "landmarks" at different hierarchical levels.  Packet 
   forwarding is consistent with the landmark hierarchy and the path 
   is gradually refined from the top level hierarchy to lower levels 
   as a packet approaches its destination.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Landmark Routing Protocol           May 17, 2001


   LANMAR borrows the concept of landmark and extends it to the 
   wireless ad hoc environment.  LANMAR scheme does not require 
   predefined hierarchical address, but it uses the notion of landmarks
   to keep track of logical subnets in which the members have a 
   commonality of interests and are likely to move as a "group" 
   (e.g., brigade in the battlefield, a group of students from same 
   class and a team of co-workers at a convention).  Each such 
   logical group has an elected landmark.  For each group, 
   underlying "scoped" routing algorithm will provide a one-level 
   scope.  The routing update packets are restricted only within the 
   scope.  Accurate routing information for nodes within scope is 
   maintained.  The routing information to remote nodes (nodes outside
   the node's scope) is "summarized" by the corresponding landmarks. 
   Thus, the LANMAR scheme largely reduces the routing table size and 
   the routing update traffic overhead.  It greatly improves 
   scalability.

   In addition, in order to recover from landmark failures, 
   a "landmark" node is elected in each subnet.  Landmark election 
   provides a flexible way for the LANMAR protocol to cope with a 
   dynamic and mobile network.  The protocol also provides a solution 
   for drifters (Nodes that are outside the fisheye scopes of the 
   landmarks of their logical groups).  Extra storage, processing and 
   line overhead will be incurred for landmark election and drifter 
   bookkeeping.  However, the design of the algorithms provides 
   solutions without compromising scalability.  For example, the 
   routing overhead for handling drifters is typically small if the 
   fraction of drifting nodes is small.  More analysis is given in 
   Section 8.

   The LANMAR runs on top of a proactive routing protocol.  It  
   requires that the underlying routing protocol support the scoped 
   subnetworking.  Fisheye State Routing Protocol (FSR) [7,8] is 
   such a protocol that supports LANMAR.  In FSR, the link state 
   protocol is used within the scope.   The fisheye scope 
   technique can also be applied to a distance vector type protocol,
   such as DSDV [3], in which the hop distance can be used to 
   bind the scope for routing message updating.  The main advantage of
   LANMAR is that the routing table includes only the nodes within the
   scope and the landmark nodes.  This feature greatly improves 
   scalability by reducing routing table size and update traffic O/H.

   Thus the Landmark Routing Protocol provides an efficient and 
   scalable routing solution for a mobile, ad hoc environment while 
   keeping line and storage overhead (O/H) low.  Moreover, the 
   election provides a much needed recovery from landmark failures.

2. Changes

   Major changes from version 00 to version 01:

   -  A destination sequence number for each landmark is used to 
      ensure loop-free updates for a particular landmark.

   -  Landmark updates are propagated in separate messages, instead of
      being piggybacked on local routing updates.  This modification 
      decouples landmark routing from the underlying proactive routing
      protocol.

4. Protocol Applicability                 

4.1. Networking Context

   LANMAR is best suited for large scale mobile ad hoc wireless 
   networks.  The landmark scheme on top of "scoped" routing algorithm
   has large advantages in reducing routing update packet size and 
   keeping progressive accurate routes to remote nodes.  It achieves 
   high data packet delivery ratio.  Moreover, the fact that the route
   error is blurred by distance obviously reduces the sensitivity to 
   network size.

   LANMAR is also suited for high mobility ad hoc wireless networks. 
   This is because in a mobility environment, a change on a link far 
   away from the source does not necessarily cause a change in the 
   routing table at the source and that all the information about 
   remote nodes is summarized by landmarks.

4.2. Protocol Characteristics and Mechanisms  

   * Does the protocol provide support for unidirectional links?(if so,
   how?)

        No. 

   * Does the protocol require the use of tunneling? (if so, how?)
        No.

   * Does the protocol require using some form of source routing? (if
   so, how?)

        No.  

   * Does the protocol require the use of periodic messaging? (if so,
   how?)

        Yes.  The LANMAR periodically broadcasts landmark information 
        to its neighbors. 

   * Does the protocol require the use of reliable or sequenced packet
   delivery? (if so, how?)

        No.  As the packets are sent periodically, they need not be 
        sent reliably.

   * Does the protocol provide support for routing through a multi-

   technology routing fabric? (if so, how?)

        Yes.  It is assumed that each node's network interface is 
        assigned a unique IP address.
  
   * Does the protocol provide support for multiple hosts per router?
   (if so, how?)

        Yes. The router that has multiple hosts can use network ID of 
        these hosts as the address to participate LANMAR.

   * Does the protocol support the IP addressing architecture? (if so,
   how?)

        Yes.  Each node is assumed to have a unique IP address (or
        set of unique IP addresses in the case of multiple interfaces).
        The LANMAR references all nodes/interfaces by their IP address.
        This version of the LANMAR also supports IP network addressing
        (network prefixes) for routers that provide access to a 
        network of non-router hosts.

   * Does the protocol require link or neighbor status sensing (if so,
   how?)

        No. 

   * Does the protocol have dependence on a central entity? (if so,
   how?)

        No.  

   * Does the protocol function reactively? (if so, how?)

        No.         

   * Does the protocol function proactively? (if so, how?)

        Yes.  The LANMAR proactively maintains landmark information 
        at each node.  

   * Does the protocol provide loop-free routing? (if so, how?)

        Yes.  For in-scope destinations, the protocol uses routing
        paths learned from the host protocol.  If the host protocol 
        provides loop-free routing, e.g., FSR and DSDV, so does LANMAR.
        For out-scope destinations, only routes to landmarks are used.
        Because these routes are DSDV, it is loop free.  When a packet
        approaches the destination, in-scope routes are used again.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Landmark Routing Protocol           May 17, 2001



   * Does the protocol provide for sleep period operation?(if so, how?)

        Yes.  However, this requires TDMA MAC layer support.  The 
        router can be scheduled to sleep during idle periods.

   * Does the protocol provide some form of security? (if so, how?)

        Yes.  When a node broadcasts routing update message, only 
        entries of in-scope nodes and landmarks are included.  This 
        will prevent other remote nodes from being heard.

   * Does the protocol provide support for utilizing multi-channel,
     link-layer technologies? (if so, how?)

        Yes.  In fact, the multi-channel can be used to separate 
        routing messages from user data packets.


5. Protocol Overview 

5.1. Protocol Descriptions

   As mentioned in Section 1, the landmark concept we adopt here uses 
   the notion of logical subnets in which the members have a 
   commonality of interests and are likely to move as a "group".  
   Each logical subnet has one node serving as a "landmark" of that 
   subnet.  The protocol requires that the landmark of each subnet have
   the knowledge of all the members in its group.  The LANMAR protocol 
   also uses a scope at each node.  The size of the scope is a 
   parameter measured in hop distance.  It is chosen in such a way that
   if a node is at the center of a subnet, the scope will cover the 
   majority of the subnet members.  If the shape of a subnet is likely 
   to be a cycle, the center node's scope will cover all the members of
   the subnet.  If this center node is elected as a landmark, it 
   fulfills the requirement of the protocol.  The elected landmark 
   uses a destination sequence number to ensure its routing entry 
   update is loop-free.  The landmarks are propagated in a
   distance vector mechanism.  Each node maintains a distance vector
   for landmarks of all the subnets.  The size of the landmark distance 
   vector equals to the number of logical subnets and thus landmark 
   nodes.  If a landmark does not locate at the center, there will be 
   some members drifting off its scope.  The landmark will keep a 
   distance vector for drifters of its group.  The distance vectors 
   for landmarks and drifters are exchanged among neighbors in 
   periodical routing update packets.

   The LANMAR relies on an underlying proactive protocol with the 



Gerla, Hong, Ma and Pei                                       [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT        Landmark Routing Protocol           May 17, 2001


   ability of providing "scoped" routing.  In the scoped routing, each
   node broadcasts routing information periodically to its immediate 
   neighbors.  In each update packet, the node sends routing table 
   entries within its scope.  The host routing protocol uses sequence
   numbers for routing entries.  Each node advances its sequence 
   number before sending an update packet.  Through the exchange 
   process, the table entries with larger sequence numbers replace 
   the ones with smaller sequence numbers.

   Let's take, for example, the FSR as our host protocol.  For nodes 
   within the scope, the updating is in a certain frequency.  But 
   for nodes beyond the scope, the update frequency is reduced to 
   zero;  Only the update frequency of the landmark nodes remains 
   unaltered.  As a result, each node maintains accurate routing 
   information for in-scope nodes and keep routing directions to the 
   landmark nodes for out-scope nodes, or say, for remote groups.  
   A packet directed to a remote destination initially aims at the 
   landmark of that remote group; as it gets closer to the landmark, 
   it may eventually switch to the accurate route to the destination 
   provided by in-scope nodes of the destination.

5.2. Landmark Election

   Dynamic election/re-election of landmark node is essential for 
   LANMAR to work in a wireless mobile environment.  Basically, each 
   node tracks other nodes of its group in its scope and computes  
   "weight", e.g. the number of the nodes it has found.  At the 
   beginning of the LANMAR, no landmark exists.  Protocol LANMAR 
   only uses the host protocol functionality.  As host routing 
   computation progresses, one of the nodes will learn (from 
   the host protocol's routing table) that more than a certain number 
   of group members (say, T) are in its scope.  It then proclaims 
   itself as a landmark for this group and adds itself to the landmark
   distance vector.  Landmarks broadcast the election weights to
   the neighbors jointly with the landmark update packets.  

   When more than one node declares itself as a landmark in the same 
   group, as the landmark information floods out, each node will 
   perform a winner competition procedure.  Only one landmark for each
   group will survive and it will be elected.  To avoid flapping 
   between landmarks (very possible in a mobile situation), we use 
   hysteresis in the replacement of an existing landmark.  I.e., the 
   old Landmark is replaced by the new one only if its weight is, say 
   less than 1/2 of the weight of the current election winner.  Once 
   ousted, the old leader needs the full weight superiority to be 
   reinstated.

   This procedure is carried out periodically in the background (low 



Gerla, Hong, Ma and Pei                                       [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT        Landmark Routing Protocol           May 17, 2001


   overhead, anyway).  At steady state, a landmark propagates its 
   presence to all other nodes like a sink in DSDV.  It is extremely 
   simple and it converges (by definition).  In a mobile environment, 
   an elected landmark may eventually lose its role.  The role shifting
   is a frequent event.  In a transient period, there exist several 
   landmarks in a single group.  The transient period may be actually 
   the norm at high mobility.  This transient behavior can be 
   drastically reduced by using hysteresis. 

   When a landmark dies, its neighbors will detect the silence after 
   a given timeout.  The neighbors of the same group will then take 
   the responsibilities as landmarks and broadcast new landmark 
   information.  A new round of landmark election then floods over 
   the entire network.

5.3. Drifters

   Typically, all members in a logical subnet are within the scope of 
   the landmark, thus the landmark has a route to all members.  It may
   happen, however, that some of the members "drift off" the scope, 
   for example, a tank in a battalion may become stranded or lost. 
   To keep track of such "drifters", i.e., to make the route to them 
   known to the landmark, the following modification to the routing 
   table exchange is necessary.  Each node, say i, on the shortest 
   path between a landmark L and a drifter l associated with that 
   landmark keeps a distance vector entry to l.  Note that if l is 
   within the scope of i, this entry is already included in the 
   routing table of node i.  When i transmits its distance vector to 
   neighbor, say j, then j will retain the entry to member l only if 
   d(j,l) is smaller than the scope or d(j,L) is smaller than d(i,L). 
   The latter condition occurs if j is on the shortest path from i 
   (and therefore from l) to L.  This way, a path is maintained from 
   the landmark to each of its members, including drifters.  The 
   procedure starts from l, at the time when a node finds it becomes 
   a drifter.  It informs the landmark hop by hop about its presence. 

   The occurrences of drifters are dynamic in a mobile network.  In 
   order to timely remove the staled drifter information, the time 
   when a node hears a drifter is recorded. 


6. Protocol Specifications            

   This section discusses the operation of LANMAR routing protocol.  
   The sending and receiving of landmark updates are in the proactive 
   nature.  The routing packets are processed separately from 
   ordinary data packets.

6.1. Data Structures    

   Each node has a unique "logical" identifier defined by a subnet 
   field and a host field.  The host field is unique in the subnet and
   might in fact coincide with the physical address.  The "logical" 
   identifier can also be an IP address when the subnet address can 
   logically group the nodes.  Moreover, each node keeps a landmark 
   status tuple.  As LANMAR runs on top of a host routing protocol, 
   it shares the underlying routing table structures.  LANMAR 
   maintains a neighbor list and shares it with the host protocol.  
   In addition, LANMAR keeps a drifter list and a landmark distance 
   vector. 

6.1.1. Landmark Status Tuple

   Each node has not only a "logical" identifier, which basically is 
   its address, but also a landmark status tuple.  The tuple includes 
   a flag which indicates whether the node is a landmark or not, a
   election weight (the number of group members the node detects within
   its scope) and a sequence number.  When a node is elected, the 
   status tuple will be copied to its landmark distance vector.  The 
   sequence number is advanced. There are three fields for a tuple:
   - Landmark flag
   - Number of group members in its scope
   - Sequence number
 
6.1.2. Landmark Distance Vector 

   Landmark distance vector (LMDV) gives the next hop information to 
   all landmarks in the network.  Every subnet has an entry in LMDV. 
   The latest route information to the landmark of each subnet is 
   learned when a landmark update message is received.  LMDV functions
   as a part of the routing table.  It has the following fields:
   - Landmark status tuple
   - Next hop address
   - Distance

6.1.3. Drifter List
 
   The drifter list (DFDV) of LANMAR provides the next hop information
   of the drifters known to the current node.  The entries are updated 
   with landmark update message.  The latest time a drifter is heard 
   is recorded in DFDV.  The DFDV works as a part of routing table.  
   It has the following fields:
   -  Destination drifter address
   -  Next hop address
   -  Distance
   -  Last heard time

6.1.4. Neighbor List
 
   The neighbor list of LANMAR keeps current neighbor information for
   a node.  The latest time a neighbor is heard is recorded.  The 
   neighbor list has the following fields:
   -  Neighbor address
   -  Neighbor landmark flag 
   -  Last heard time

6.2. LANMAR Update Message Format

   There is only one message type of LANMAR protocol. The messages are
   periodically exchanged with neighbors.  They update the landmark 
   distance vector LMDV and the drifter list DFDV.  The processing of 
   the LMDV and DFDV will be describe separately.  The following format
   does not include the node's identifier because it can be obtained 
   from IP Header.

6.2.1. Description of the fields

   Landmark Flag
      
      The landmark flag of the sending node.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Landmark Routing Protocol           May 17, 2001


   N_landmarks

      The number of entries of the landmark distance vector.

   N_drifters

      The number of entries of the drifter list.

   Reserved

      The bits are set to '0' and are ignored on reception.

   Landmark Address 1, Next Hop Address 1, Distance 1, N_members 1 
   and Sequence Number 1

      The first entry in the landmark distance vector.  
      Landmark Address 1, N_members 1 and Sequence Number 1 are the 
      status tuple of the destination landmark.  
      Next Hop Address 1 and Distance 1 is the next hop and distance 
      to the landmark.

      These fields are repeated N_landmarks times for each entry in 
      landmark distance vector.

   Drifter Address 1, Next Hop Address 1 and Distance 1

      The first entry in the drifter list. 
      Next Hop Address 1 and Distance 1 are the next hop and distance 
      to the Drifter Address 1.  

      These fields are repeated N_drifters times for each entry in 
      the drifter list.

   The length of the message is limited to the maximum IP packet size.
   In that case, multiple packets may be required to broadcast all the
   entries.  

6.3. Processing Landmark Updates

   Landmark update information is a part of the LANMAR periodic 
   routing update message.  The update information includes sender's
   LMDV.  Landmark update message is used for landmark election and 
   building paths to landmarks.  

6.3.1. Originating a Landmark in a Subnet
  
   Every time a node detects a neighbor change, it recalculates the 
   number of group members in its scope.  The new number of group 



Gerla, Hong, Ma and Pei                                      [Page 13]

INTERNET-DRAFT        Landmark Routing Protocol           May 17, 2001


   members is recorded in its election weight field.  If this 
   number is greater than a threshold T, the node qualifies as a 
   landmark only when it is the only landmark for the group so far, 
   or it wins the election when competing with the existing landmark.
   When it becomes a landmark, it increases its sequence number by 2.
   The old landmark entry is replaced with the new winner.  The 
   landmark entry will be broadcast to neighbors with the next update
   packet.  Every time before a landmark sends updates, it increases
   its sequence number and copies it to LMDV.  

6.3.2. Receiving Landmark Updates 

   When a node receives a landmark update message, it compares its 
   LMDV entries with the incoming LMDV updates for each subnet.   
   A landmark update corresponding to a new subnet will be copied.  
   An update having the same landmark as already given (in node's LMDV) 
   will be accepted only if it contains a larger sequence number. 
   If an update contains a  different landmark for the same subnet as 
   recorded in LMDV, only one landmark will be elected through a 
   winner competition algorithm.  LMDV will be updated according to 
   the outcomes of the competition.  

6.3.3. Winner Competition

   When more than one node declares itself as a landmark in the same 
   group, a simple solution is to let the node with the largest 
   number of group members win the election and in case of tie, 
   lowest ID breaks the tie.  The other competing nodes defer.  
   However, this method is likely to cause the oscillation of 
   landmark roles between nodes. 

   To use hysteresis in replacing an existing landmark, let us assume 
   the competing node's number of members is M, the existing 
   landmark's number of members is N and a factor value S.  When M is 
   greater than N*S, then the competing node replaces the existing 
   landmark.  Or, when N reduces to a value smaller than a threshold T,
   then it gives up the landmark role.  A tie occurs when M falls 
   within an interval [N*1/S, N*S], then the node with larger member 
   number wins the election.  If a tie occurs again with equal member 
   number, i.e., M equals to N, it is broken using lowest ID.  A tie 
   can always be broken using lowest ID as the address is used as ID 
   and it is unique. 

6.4. Processing Drifter Updates

   Drifter update information is a part of the LANMAR periodical 
   routing update message.  The update information is the drifter list
   (DFDV) of the sender.  The computation of the DFDV at each node 



Gerla, Hong, Ma and Pei                                      [Page 14]

INTERNET-DRAFT        Landmark Routing Protocol           May 17, 2001


   includes checking the node itself to see whether it is a drifter 
   and recording paths to other drifters.

6.4.1. Originating a Drifter Entry
 
   By checking the distance to the landmark of its group, each node 
   easily knows whether it has become a drifter.  If the distance is 
   larger than the scope, the node will put itself into its drifter 
   list.  This drifter information will be sent back to the landmark 
   hop by hop along the shortest path to it which can be learned from
   the LMDV.  For each drifter, only the node on its shortest path 
   to the landmark needs to receive its information, so before the 
   entry is broadcast, the next hop to landmark is attached with 
   its entry.  The DFDV will be propagated with the next update packet.

6.4.2. Receiving Drifter Updates

   Upon receiving an update packet, the DFDV part is retrieved and 
   processed.  If an entry of incoming DFDV indicates that the current
   node is its next hop to the landmark, i.e., the current node is on 
   the drifter's shortest path to the landmark, the current node will 
   insert or update its drifter list.  The receiving time is stamped
   in the DFDV.  The node sending the update packet is recorded as the
   next hop to the drifter.  The reverse path to the drifter is thus 
   built up.  The procedure ends when the landmark receives the 
   drifter entry.  The updated DFDV will be propagated with the next 
   update packet.

6.4.3. Removing a Drifter Entry

   Each entry in DFDV is time stamped of its last receiving time.  
   Every time before the DFDV is sent or routing by DFDV is needed, 
   the table is checked for staled entries. If such an entry is found,
   it is removed. 
   
6.5. Processing Neighbor List 
 
   When a node receives either a landmark update or a host protocol
   routing update, the neighbor list is inserted if the update comes
   from a new neighbor, or the corresponding neighbor entry is 
   updated.  Current time is recorded with the entry.  The 
   neighbor list is also search at this time for possible lost 
   neighbors according to the time stamps.  If such a neighbor is 
   found, it is removed from the list.  

7. Data Packet Forwarding 

   Data packets are relayed hop by hop.  The host protocol routing 



Gerla, Hong, Ma and Pei                                      [Page 15]

INTERNET-DRAFT        Landmark Routing Protocol           May 17, 2001


   table, drifter list and landmark distance vector are looked up 
   sequentially for the destination entry.  If the destination is 
   within a node's scope, the entry can be found directly in the 
   routing table and the packet is forwarded to the next hop node. 
   Otherwise, the drifter list DFDV is searched for the destination. 
   If the entry is found, the packet is forwarded using the next hop 
   address from DFDV.  If not, the logical subnet field of the 
   destination is retrieved and the LMDV entry of the landmark 
   corresponding to the destination's logical subnet is searched.  
   The data packet is then routed towards the landmark using the next 
   hop address from LMDV.  The packet, however, is not necessary to 
   pass through the landmark.  Rather, once the packet gets within the
   scope of the destination on its way towards the landmark, it is 
   routed to the destination directly.


8. Discussion about Storage and Processing Overhead for Drifters

   The routing storage and processing overhead introduced by the 
   distance vector extension to handle drifters is typically small 
   if the fraction of drifting nodes is small.  Consider a network 
   with N nodes and L landmarks, and assume that a fraction F of the
   members of each logical subnet have drifted.  In the worst case, 
   the path length from landmark to drifter is the square root of N 
   (assuming a grid topology).  Thus, sqrt(N) is the bound on the 
   number of extra routing entries required at the nodes along the 
   path to the drifter.  The total number of extra routing entries is
   sqrt(N)*L*(F*N/L) where N/L is the average logical group size. 
   Thus, the extra storage per node is F*sqrt(N).  Now, let us assume
   that the number of nodes in the scope = # of landmarks = logical 
   group size = sqrt(N).  Then, the basic routing table overhead per 
   node (excluding drifters) is 3*sqrt(N).  Thus, the extra overhead 
   caused by drifters is F/3.  If 20% of the nodes in a group are 
   outside of the landmark scope, i.e., have drifted, the extra 
   routing O/H required to keep track of them is only 7%.
