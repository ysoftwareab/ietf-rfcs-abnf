1.  Introduction

   The "Signature Validation Token" specification [SVT] defines a basic
   token to support signature validation in a way that can significantly
   extend the lifetime of a signature.

   This specification defines a profile for implementing SVT with a
   signed PDF document, and defines the following aspects of SVT usage:

   *  How to include reference data related to PDF signatures and PDF
      documents in an SVT.

   *  How to add an SVT token to a PDF document.

   PDF document signatures are added as incremental updates to the
   signed PDF document and signs all data of the PDF document up until
   the current signature.  When more than one signature is added to a
   PDF document the previous signature is signed by the next signature
   and can not be updated with additional data after this event.

   To minimize the impact on PDF documents with multiple signatures and
   to stay backwards compatible with PDF software that do not understand
   SVT, PDF documents add one SVT token for all signatures of the PDF as
   an extension to a document timestamp added to the signed PDF as an
   incremental update.  This SVT covers all signatures of the signed
   SVT.

2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The definitions in [SVT] apply also to this document.

3.  SVT in PDF Documents

   An SVT added to a signed PDF document SHALL be added to a document
   timestamp accordance with ISO 32000-2:2017 [ISOPDF2].

   The document timestamp contains an [RFC3161] timestamp token
   (TSTInfo) in EncapsulatedContentInfo of the CMS signature.  The SVT
   SHALL be added to the timestamp token (TSTInfo) as an Extension
   object as defined in Section 3.1.

3.1.  SVT Extension to Timestamp Tokens

   The SVT extension is an Extension suitable to be included in TSTInfo
   as defined by [RFC3161].

   The SVT extension is identified by the Object Identifier (OID)
   1.2.752.201.5.2

   Editors note: This is the current used OID.  Consider assigning an
   IETF extension OID.

   This extension data (OCTET STRING) holds the bytes of SVT JWT,
   represented as a UTF-8 encoded string.

   This extension SHALL NOT be marked critical.

   Note: Extensions in timestamp tokens according to [RFC3161] are
   imported from the definition of the X.509 certificate extensions
   defined in [RFC5280].

4.  SVT Claims

4.1.  Signature Reference Data

   The SVT SHALL contain a SigReference claims object that SHALL contain
   the following data:

   *  id - Absent or a Null value.

   *  sig_hash - The hash over the signature value bytes.

   *  sb_hash - The hash over the DER encoded SignedAttributes in
      SignerInfo.

4.2.  Signed Data Reference Data

   An SVT according to this profile SHALL contain exactly one instance
   of the *SignedData* claims object.  The *SignedData* claims object
   shall contain the following data:

   *  ref - The string representation of the ByteRange value of the PDF
      signature dictionary of the target signature.  This is a sequence
      of integers separated by space where each integer pair specifies
      the start index and length of a byte range.

   *  hash - The hash of all bytes identified by the ByteRange value.
      This is the concatenation of all byte ranges identified by the
      ByteRange value.

4.3.  Signer Certificate References

   The SVT SHALL contain a CertReference claims object.  The type claim
   of the CertReference claims object SHALL be either chain or
   chain_hash`.

   *  The chain type SHALL be used when signature validation was
      performed using one or more certificates where some or all of the
      certificates in the chain are not present in the target signature.

   *  The chain_hash type SHALL be used when signature validation was
      performed using one or more certificates where all of the
      certificates are present in the target signature.

   Note: The referenced signer certificate MUST match any certificates
   referenced using ESSCertID or ESSCertIDv2 from [RFC5035].

5.  JOSE Header

5.1.  SVT Signing Key Reference

   The SVT JOSE header must contain one of the following header
   parameters in accordance with [RFC7515], for storing a reference to
   the public key used to verify the signature on the SVT:

Internet-Draft         Signature Validation Token           October 2020


   *  x5c - Holds an X.509 certificate [RFC5280] or a chain of
      certificates.  The certificate holding the public key that
      verifies the signature on the SVT MUST be the first certificate in
      the chain.

   *  kid - A key identifier holding the Base64 encoded hash value of
      the certificate that can verify the signature on the SVT.  The
      hash algorithm MUST be the same hash algorithm used when signing
      the SVT as specified by the "alg" header parameter.  The
      referenced certificate SHOULD be the same certificate that was
      used to sign the document timestamp that contains the SVT.
