Abstract


   This memo is an extension to the SNMP MIB.  It specifies an IAB
   standards track protocol for the Internet community, and requests
   discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This memo extends
   the MIB defined in [BGP-MIB].


   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.  Please forward comments to
   idr@merit.net.




1. Introduction


   This memo defines extensions to the MIB defined in [BGP-MIB].  In
   particular, it describes managed objects based upon attributes defined
   in "BGP Extended Communities Attribute" [BGP-EXTCOMM].


2. Overview


   These objects are used to control and manage a BGP-4 implementation
   that supports BGP Extended Communities [BGP-EXTCOMM].  This MIB extends
   one table defined in [BGP-MIB]:  the BGP-4 Received Path Attribute Table.

   This MIB defines the following primary objects:

    - bgp4ExtCommTable { bgp 13 1 }

      This table contains the set of extended communities received with each
      incoming route.
