Abstract


    
    This paper defines the changes as would be required for the Domain Name
    System (DNS) to support the Network(s) IP Addresses assigned and listed
    using the Globalnet's Backbone, which are defined by the IPtX IP
    Addressing Protocol Family Specification. Furthermore, notwithstanding
    the requirements necessitated by change, this presentation retains the
    current Communications Protocol Specifications, which are currently used
    for the DNS Query in the IPv4 Specification. And while the DNS Service for
    the IPt1 Specification is identical to the IPv4 Specification. However,
    because the other IP Addressing Protocols define within the IPtX Protocol
    Specification requires the use of Prefixes, which change the Header Size
    Specification. The implementation of these IP Addressing Systems, while
    using the same Communications Protocol Specifications, nevertheless,
    redefines the Structure for the Naming Convention used in the DNS
    Hierarchy. Even still, asides from the clarity, referencing the RFC's
    governing the DNS Service Specifications will be somewhat limited. This
    is because the overall functions, and their respective Definitions for
    the IPv4 DNS Specification will not change in the IPtX DNS Specification.
    Hence, the objective this paper specifically maintains concerns only the
    presentation of the Subject-Matter relating to the change in the DNS
    Service(s), resulting from the implementation of the IPtX IP Addressing
    Protocol Specification. 

    In other words, the paper does not represent a replacement for any of RFCs,
    which implemented the DNS Services. It should nonetheless, be considered an
    extension, which focuses upon the changes in the DNS Services resulting from
    the implementation of the IPtX IP Protocol Specification.

Chapter I: Current Specifications: The IPv4 DNS Server and the IPt1
           Specification



    The abbreviation 'DNS' is the acronym use for Domain Name System, which
    represents a Data Base system using a Hierarchical Naming Convention that
    uses the Names Networked Computers and Network Services in a Hierarchy of
    Domains Organized to resolve their Names and IP Addresses. The DNS
    Services was derived specifically for use in TCP/IP Networks using the
    Internet thoroughfare, which is used to locate Computers and Services
    using an alpha character name associated with an IP Address. That is,
    when a user or an application, for example, requires the IP Address of
    either a Computer, Network, or Network Service, the DNS Service only
    requires the Alpha Character Name of required Networked System or Device,
    to Resolve it's IP Address (Or the converse). Furthermore, it should be
    understood, these Names, usually called 'Friendly Names', which are
    assigned to these Networked Systems and Devices, can be composed of
    either an Alpha or a Numeric Character Content, or some combination
    relating thereto. Because what the DNS Services does is specify a Naming
    format using Dotted structure similar to an IP Address, which uses a
    'Friendly Name' assigned by the User that is prefixed with 'WWW' and
    Suffixed with a TAG. This method is used to facilitate the location of
    Data Base Records that are used to Map an IP Address to Name, or the Name
    to an IP Address, which are used to determine the location of the
    Networked Device. In other words, Hierarchy of Domains maintained in the
    DNS Services Data Base assigns the Networked Computer or Service to a
    Record, which is then Indexed to discover location of the Devices
    connected to the Internet's Backbone.

    Nevertheless, to clarify the DNS Naming Architecture, I chose an excerpt
    from RFC 1032 that can used to Define the Top Level Domain Names:




"WHICH DOMAIN NAME?

   The designers of the domain-naming system initiated several general
   categories of names as top-level domain names, so that each could
   accommodate a variety of organizations.  The current top-level
   domains registered with the DDN Network Information Center are ARPA,
   COM, EDU, GOV, MIL, NET, and ORG, plus a number of top-level country
   domains.  To join one of these, a DA needs to be aware of the purpose
   for which it was intended.

      "ARPA" is a temporary domain.  It is by default appended to the
      names of hosts that have not yet joined a domain.  When the system
      was begun in 1984, the names of all hosts in the Official DoD
      Internet Host Table maintained by the NIC were changed by adding
      of the label ".ARPA" in order to accelerate a transition to the
      domain-naming system.  Another reason for the blanket name changes
      was to force hosts to become accustomed to using the new style
      names and to modify their network software, if necessary.  This
      was done on a network-wide basis and was directed by DCA in DDN
      Management Bulletin No. 22.  Hosts that fall into this domain will
      eventually move to other branches of the domain tree.


      "COM" is meant to incorporate subdomains of companies and
      businesses.

      "EDU" was initiated to accommodate subdomains set up by
      universities and other educational institutions.

      "GOV" exists to act as parent domain for subdomains set up by
      government agencies.

      "MIL" was initiated to act as parent to subdomains that are
      developed by military organizations.

      "NET" was introduced as a parent domain for various network-type
      organizations.  Organizations that belong within this top-level
      domain are generic or network-specific, such as network service
      centers and consortia.  "NET" also encompasses network
      management-related organizations, such as information centers and
      operations centers.

E Terrell                                                           [Page 7]

DNS for the IPtX IP Addressing Protocol Family              November 18, 2002





      "ORG" exists as a parent to subdomains that do not clearly fall
      within the other top-level domains.  This may include technical-
      support groups, professional societies, or similar organizations.

      "INT" exists as a parent to subdomains that do not clearly fall
      within the other top-level domains.  This may include International
      organizations, such as NATO [9].


   One of the guidelines in effect in the domain-naming system is that a
   host should have only one name regardless of what networks it is
   connected to.  This implies, that, in general, domain names should
   not include routing information or addresses.  For example, a host
   that has one network connection to the Internet and another to BITNET
   should use the same name when talking to either network.  For a
   description of the syntax of domain names, please refer to Section 3
   of RFC-1034."

  

    Nevertheless, while I could continue quoting from the various RFCs
    outlining the requirements for the DNS Services (RFC: 1032, 1033, 1034,
    1101, 1591, 1886, 2065, etc). However, since there is absolutely No change
    with the implementation of the IPt1 Specification from that required by the
    IPv4 Specification, it would be redundant to continue. In other words,
    barring the differences in their respective Addressing Schematics, these IP
    Addressing Specifications are Mirror Images, which represents the same
    methods for the Default IP Addressing format (See Tables 1 and 2). And
    while the IPt1 Specification maintains a greater Sub-Division of the
    Classes within the Address Class System, the benefits gained here does not
    translate into additional costs for the Consumer. In fact, this Addressing
    Specification [1], can be viewed initially, as an Accountability benefit
    for IANA, and as an additional Resource of IP Addresses for InterNIC.    
    
    Needless to say, while the expansion of the CIDR Architecture [6] (Figures
    1 and 2), offers alternatives to the Header Design. It also maintains the
    same sub-divisional capabilities for the Records use for the DNS Services.
    However, this benefit would pale in comparison to that achieved with the IP
    Addressing Schematic. This is because the overall benefit is limited (At
    least in the Case for the IPt1 Specification) to the DNS Lookup Dealing
    Specifically with the IP Address. In other words, while there is no mandate
    specifying a change to the current specification. The benefits of using the
    CIDR Network Descriptor in the Definition (Naming) of the any DNS Records
    identifying the IP Address would allow a further sub-division, which would
    reduce the search time when the IP Address is known and the Name of the
    Networked Device is sought. But still, this would only reflect a partial
    benefit, which does not (At least not now) maintain any viable grounds
    that would justify a change in the current DNS Record Configuration.

Chapter II:  The IPtX DNS Services: and the Implications of the 'Zone IP',
             and 'IP Area Code' {IN-ADD.APRA Addressing}

    
    
  The DNS Services Protocol:


    The implementation of the IPtX IP Addressing Protocol Family Specification
    does very little insofar as Changing the Current DNS Services presently
    being used in the IPv4 IP Addressing Specification. And while the first
    IP Addressing System, IPt1, in this Addressing Family, does not require any
    Changes to the Current DNS Services Specification. There are nevertheless,
    Changes in the DNS Services Specification, which would result from the
    implementation of the remaining IP Addressing Systems contained in this
    Addressing Protocol Family. These changes however, are minor, because they
    actually do not to change the Foundational Definitions, Operations, nor
    Functional Purpose of the DNS Service Specification presently being used.

    Nevertheless, because there is a Header Size increase, which is Larger than
    the present Header Size Specification. The only compensation, or Change
    required by the IPtX DNS Service Specification deals with the 'Bit Size' for
    some the functions within the 'DNS Protocol', which are required for the
    Transmission of a 'DNS Query'. In other words, other than the addition of
    the 'CIDR Network Descriptor' and 3 New 'TYPE RECORD': 1) Specifying the
    Reverse for the Device Network Name, TYPE 43 ='RNN'= IN-ADDR.APARA NAME =
    Reverse Network Domain Name, 2) TYPE 44 = 'RNN-PTR' = Reverse Network Domain
    Name-Domain Name Pointer, and 3) TYPE 44 = 'AA' = IPtX. The only other
    changes that would be required to implement the IPtX DNS Protocol would to
    Increase the BIT Size of the; 'Identification' number, 'Opcode', 'Rcode',
    'Total Questions', 'Total Answer RRs', 'Total Authority RRs', 'Total
    Additional RRs', 'Type', 'Length Rdata', 'TTL', 'UDP Header', and the 'TCP'
    Header. Nevertheless, while noting specifically that the 'Reserve', 'Data
    Offset', 'Control Bits', and 'ECN' are not affected by the Changes occuring
    in the 'TCP' Header. However, the Window Size Changes to a 48 Bit HEX
    Number, which was implemented to Accommodate the Larger 'Ack' and 'Response'
    Sizes used in the IPtX DNS Specification. In fact, having only 2 Header IP
    Bit Mapped Address Sizes Defined for the entire range of this Infinitely
    Large IP Protocol Addressing Family, provides this Protocol Specification
    with the necessary Stability, which makes it ideally suited for Global IP
    Addressing and Security. (See Figures 3, 4, and 4-A through 4-H)





E Terrell                                                           [Page 15]

DNS for the IPtX IP Addressing Protocol Family              November 18, 2002




    
  The DNS Services:

    
    The only other Change(s) required by the implementation of the IPtX DNS
    Services Specification deals specifically with:


            1. The Mandate requiring Globally Unique User Friendly Names for
               all Networked Nodes or Devices


            2. The Introduction of the IN-ADDR.APRA Naming Convention


            3. The Reinstatement of the Definition of TLD-Names: Reverse Network
               Domain Names; Title: IN-ADDR.APARA NAME = IN-ADDR.RNN


            4. Greater Sub-Division of the IPtX DNS 'Data Base' Records

 

    And while the Structure of the IPtX DNS Tree Schematic differs from the
    current Specification. It's Hierarchical Structure is the True, or actual
    representation of the Global Community, which does not require any Change
    in the Functions Defined for the IPtX DNS Servers. However, while the
    suggestion would be to Label a Zone Server with a User Friendly that
    provides a Description of it's Ranking and it's Location. Having a
    Mandatory Naming Convention, other than the requirement for a Globally
    Unique User Friendly Name that is assigned to the Network IP Address, is
    not necessary. In other words, regardless of the Naming Convention, it is
    shown in EX. 1, EX. 2, EX. 3, and EX. 3 Table 1, that using the Design
    depicting the IPtX DNS Tree results in a further 'Sub-Division' of the
    Data Base Records, which would reduce the amount of TIME required for a
    DNS Query and Response. 
          
    However, to take full advantage of this Time Savings. Especially when the
    Query sought, is on the LOCAL Level, and it relates to only the 32 Bit
    portion of the IP Address within an IP Area Code Address, which is
    specifically querying about the IP Address of a Local Network Domain. It
    becomes necessary then, to discuss not only the IN-ADDR.APRA Address, but
    to introduce an IN-ADDR.APRA Naming Convention that would facilitate the
    DNS Queries at the Local Level as well. This procedure actually recovers
    the Definition, or Status the TLD-Name(s) maintained prior to the Global
    Expansion of the Internet, which was somehow lost when using the Country
    Code(s) Designations. (See EX. 4 and EX. 4 Table 1; Avoids Problems
    Discussed in RFC 1034 Section 3.5)

                  RFC 1035, Section 3.5 Problem Avoidance
        

          1. The Mandate requiring Globally Unique User Friendly Names for
             all Networked Nodes or Devices

          2. The Reinstatement of the Definition of TLD-Names: Reverse Network
             Domain Names; Title: IN-ADDR.APARA NAME = IN-ADDR.RNN

             {Eliminating the Need for Internet Domain DNS Query when
              Query in within the same Zone IP and IP Area Code Address
              Location}


          Example: The IN-ADDR.ARPA domain will contain information about the
                   ISI gateway between net 10 and 26, an MIT gateway from net
                   10 to MIT's (the word "net" tells the User that the Network
                   Domain in Question, is within His 'Zone IP' and 'IP Area
                   Code' Address; And in this case they are '001', and '002')
                   net 18, and hosts A.ISI.EDU and MULTICS.MIT.EDU. Assuming
                   that ISI gateway has addresses 001:002:10.2.0.22 and
                   001:002:26.0.0.103, and a name MILNET-GW.ISI.EDU, and the
                   MIT gateway has addresses 001:002:10.0.0.77 and
                   001:002:18.10.0.4 and a name GW.LCS.MIT.EDU, the domain
                   database would contain:


             IN-ADDR.APRA                              IN-ADDR.RNN
        |-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|    
           10:002:001:IN-ADDR.ARPA               RNN-PTR EDU.ISI.GW-MILNET *
           10:002:001:IN-ADDR.ARPA               RNN-PTR EDU.MIT.LCS.GW *
           18:002:001:IN-ADDR.ARPA               RNN-PTR EDU.MIT.LCS.GW1 *
           26:002:001:IN-ADDR.ARPA               RNN-PTR EDU.ISI.GW-MILNET1 *
           22.0.2.10:002:001:IN-ADDR.ARPA        RNN-PTR EDU.ISI.GW-MILNET2 *
           103.0.0.26:002:001:IN-ADDR.ARPA       RNN-PTR EDU.ISI.GW-MILNET3 *
           77.0.0.10:002:001:IN-ADDR.ARPA        RNN-PTR EDU.MIT.LCS.GW2 *
           4.0.10.18:002:001:IN-ADDR.ARPA        RNN-PTR EDU.MIT.LCS.GW3 *
           103.0.3.26:002:001:IN-ADDR.ARPA       RNN-PTR EDU.ISI.A
           6.0.0.10:002:001:IN-ADDR.ARPA.        RNN-PTR EDU.MIT.MULTICS
        |-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|

          Thus a program which wanted to locate gateways on net 10 would
          originate a query of the form QTYPE=RNN-PTR, QNAME = 10.IN-ADDR.ARPA.
          While it would only receive 2 RRs in response. Nonetheless, these
          requirements still eliminates the precautions specified in RFC1035*.

Chapter V: Security Considerations [7]



   This document, whose primary objective was the Development of the IPtX DNS
   Specification does not Challenge the Security Procedures specified for the
   Current DNS Specification. Hence, accepts the current Security
   Recommendations Specified for the IPv4 DNS Specification. Nevertheless, it
   is behooving to note, the Organization of a Hierarchical Structure for the
   Globalnet is suggestive of the possibility for a 'Static' Global network,
   which would allow a Permanent Geographical Design (Layout) for Networks, and
   the Assignment of IP Addresses. This facility would, inherently provide
   the additional Security Features found in most Telephony Systems. Hence,
   the creation of a far greater Security Platform. However, the implementation
   of this security feature would not provide the same degree of security for
   Networked Appliances that are accessible from another network Domain.
