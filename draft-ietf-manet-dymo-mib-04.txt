                      draft-ietf-manet-dymo-mib-04

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of the
   DYMO routing process.  The DYMO-MIB also reports state information,
   performance information, and notifications.  In addition to
   configuration, this additional state, performance and notification
   information is useful to management operators troubleshooting DYMO
   routing problems.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of a
   Dynamic MANET On-demand (DYMO) routing [I-D.ietf-manet-dymo] process.
   The DYMO-MIB also reports state information, performance metrics, and
   notifications.  In addition to configuration, this additional state,
   performance and notification information is useful to management
   stations troubleshooting routing problems.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The Dynamic MANET On-demand (DYMO) routing protocol
   [I-D.ietf-manet-dymo] is intended for use by mobile nodes in
   wireless, multihop networks.  DYMO determines unicast routes among
   DYMO routers within the network in an on-demand fashion, offering
   improved convergence in dynamic topologies.

   A DYMO router's MIB contains DYMO process configuration parameters
   (e.g. interfaces), state information (e.g. sequence number),
   performance counters (e.g. number of control messages), and
   notifications.

4.1.  DYMO Management Model

   This section describes the management model for the DYMO routing
   protocol.

   The MIB is comprised of four groups, i.e., Notifications,
   Configuration, State and Performance.  The configuration of the
   managed devices is controlled by the objects in the Configuration
   Group.  These are divided into Nodal and Interface objects.  The bulk
   of the DYMO configuration is in the Nodal objects which control
   protocol behavior.  The Interface objects merely identify/configure
   interfaces to enable DYMO routing over their interface.  The Nodal
   objects are further divided into routing (or protocol) objects and
   Gateway objects.  Gateway objects define other routing prefixes for
   which the node acts as a routing proxy on behalf of these non-local
   prefixes.

   The Configuration Objects drive the behavior of the managed DYMO
   device and hence determines the information in the remaining groups,
   i.e., State, Performance and Notifications.  The State objects
   primarily present the resulting forwarding table objects.  The
   Performance group primarily is comprised of counters for monitoring
   the number of DYMO routing messages received locally, per node and
   per interface.  The Notifications group contains objects which
   monitor changes to the interface configuration and the gateway
   prefixes configuration.

   See the below diagram outlining the DYMO-MIB device management model.

4.2.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, objects which are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB.

   o  Tunable Configuration Objects - objects whose values affect timing
      or attempt bounds on the DYMO protocol.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values which define the
      current operating state of the DYMO protocol process in the
      router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values which help an
      operator or automated tool to assess the performance of the DYMO
      protocol process on the router and the overall routing performance
      within the DYMO routing domain.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the DYMO MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following groups:

   o  dymoMIBNotifications - defines the notifications associated with
      the DYMO-MIB.  These are currently limited to notifications of
      interface state changes and gateway prefix changes.

Internet-Draft                The DYMO-MIB                  January 2011


   o  dymoMIBObjects - defines the objects forming the basis for the
      DYMO-MIB.  These objects are divided up by function into the
      following groups:

   o

      *  Configuration Group - This group contains the DYMO objects that
         configure specific options that determine the overall
         performance and operation of the routing protocol for the
         router device and its interfaces.

      *  State Group - Contains information describing the current state
         of the DYMO process such as the DYMO routing table.

      *  Performance Group - Contains objects which help to characterize
         the performance of the DYMO process, typically statistics
         counters.  There are two types of DYMO statistics: global
         counters and per interface counters.

   o  dymoMIBConformance - defines minimal and full conformance of
      implementations to this DYMO-MIB.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The textual conventions used in the DYMO-MIB are as follows.  The
   RowStatus and TruthValue textual conventions are imported from RFC
   2579 [RFC2579].  The DymoInterfaceOperStatus is defined within the
   DYMO-MIB.  This contains the current operational status of the DYMO
   interface.

5.2.  The Configuration Group

   The DYMO device is configured with a set of controls.  The list of
   configuration controls for the DYMO device follow.

   Protocol Configuration Parameters:

   o  DID

   o  MSG_HOPLIMIT

   o  ROUTE_TIMEOUT

   o  ROUTE_AGE_MIN_TIMEOUT

   o  ROUTE_SEQNUM_AGE_MAX_TIMEOUT

   o  ROUTE_USED_TIMEOUT

   o  ROUTE_DELETE_TIMEOUT

   o  ROUTE_RREQ_WAIT_TIME

   o  UNICAST_MESSAGE_SENT_TIMEOUT

   o  MSG_HOPLIMIT

   o  DISCOVERY_ATTEMPTS_MAX

   Protocol Configuration Tables:

   o  Responsible Hosts - If RESPONSIBLE_ADDRESSES is set to other than
      self address, then the DYMO router must be configured with the set
      of host addresses for which it is to generate RREP messages.

   o  Interfaces - If DYMO_INTERFACES is set to other than all, then the
      DYMO router must be told which interfaces to run the DYMO protocol
      over.  This is a table containing the interfaces and associated
      information.

5.3.  The State Group

   The State Subtree reports current state information.  State
   information from the DYMO-MIB is primarily contained in the 'Routing'
   Table.

5.3.1.  Routing Table

   The DYMO routing table contains information related to IP forwarding
   entries found by the node's DYMO processes.

5.4.  The Performance Group

   The Performance subtree reports primarily counters that relate to
   DYMO protocol activity.  The DYMO performance objects consists of per
   node and per interface objects:

   o  OwnSequenceNumber

   o  RREQ initiated

   o  RREQ sent

   o  RREQ received

      *  RRER received

5.5.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Subtree contains the list of notifications
   supported within the DYMO-MIB and their intended purpose or utility.
   This group is currently contains two notification objects, one
   related to status changes in DYMO interfaces and one related to
   changes in the gateway prefixes table.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   conjunction with the MIB module contained within this document are
   identified in this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The 'system' group in the SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] is defined as being
   mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity as a
   whole.  The 'system' group provides identification of the management
   entity and certain other system-wide data.  The DYMO-MIB does not
   duplicate those objects.

6.2.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The DYMO-MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], INET-ADDRESS-MIB
   [RFC4001] and IF-MIB [RFC2863].

         "The current DYMO sequence number. The DYMO sequence
          numbers allow nodes to judge the freshness of routing
          information and ensures loop freedom. If the sequence
          number has been assigned to be the largest possible
          number representable as a 16-bit unsigned integer
          (i.e., 65,535), then the sequence number is set to
          256 when incremented.  Setting the sequence number
          to 256 allows other nodes to detect that the number
          has rolled over and the node has not lost its sequence
          number (e.g., via reboot)."

8.  Security Considerations

   [TODO] Each specification that defines one or more MIB modules MUST
   contain a section that discusses security considerations relevant to
   those modules.  This section MUST be patterned after the latest
   approved template (available at
   http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-security.html).  Remember that the
   objective is not to blindly copy text from the template, but rather
   to think and evaluate the risks/vulnerabilities and then state/
   document the result of this evaluation.

   [TODO] if you have any read-write and/or read-create objects, please
   include the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] writable MIB objects that could be especially disruptive if
      abused MUST be explicitly listed by name and the associated
      security risks MUST be spelled out; RFC 2669 has a very good
      example.

   o  [TODO] list the writable tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] else if there are no read-write objects in your MIB module,
   use the following boilerplate paragraph.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have



Harnedy, et al.           Expires July 23, 2011                [Page 35]

Internet-Draft                The DYMO-MIB                  January 2011


   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   [TODO] if you have any sensitive readable objects, please include the
   following boilerplate paragraph.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  [TODO] you must explicitly list by name any readable objects that
      are sensitive or vulnerable and the associated security risks MUST
      be spelled out (for instance, if they might reveal customer
      information or violate personal privacy laws such as those of the
      European Union if exposed to unauthorized parties)

   o  [TODO] list the tables and objects and state why they are
      sensitive.

   [TODO] discuss what security the protocol used to carry the
   information should have.  The following three boilerplate paragraphs
   should not be changed without very good reason.  Changes will almost
   certainly require justification during IESG review.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   [TODO] In order to comply with IESG policy as set forth in
   http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html, every Internet-Draft that is
   submitted to the IESG for publication MUST contain an IANA
   Considerations section.  The requirements for this section vary
   depending what actions are required of the IANA. see RFC4181 section
   3.5 for more information on writing an IANA clause for a MIB module
   document.

   [TODO] select an option and provide the necessary details.

   Option #1:


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, a draft document
   MUST use place-holders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in a draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

10.  Contributors

   This MIB document uses the template authored by D. Harrington which
   is based on contributions from the MIB Doctors, especially Juergen
   Schoenwaelder, Dave Perkins, C.M.Heard and Randy Presuhn.

Appendix A.  Change Log

   This section identifies the changes that have been made from
   draft-ietf-manet-dymo-mib-00 .

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-dymo-mib-00 to
   draft-ietf-manet-dymo-mib-01.

   1.  Only minor changes of a typographic nature, e.g., read-only to
       read-write on MAX_ACCESS clauses of a few configuration objects.

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-dymo-mib-01 to
   draft-ietf-manet-dymo-mib-02.

   1.  Added the ForwardingFlag and BrokenFlag objects to the DYMO
       Routing Table.

   2.  Added the TruthValue Textual Convention to handle the new Routing
       Table objects.

   3.  Added the DYMO device management model to the introductory
       sections of this draft.

   4.  General clean up of the introductory sections of this draft.

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-dymo-mib-02 to
   draft-ietf-manet-dymo-mib-03.

   1.  Minor changes to the textual material and added to the IMPORTS
       text in the introductory material.

   2.  Added DEFVAL clauses to all read-write configuration objects
       having default values identified in the DYMO specification.

   These changes were made from draft-ietf-manet-dymo-mib-03 to
   draft-ietf-manet-dymo-mib-04.

   1.  Incorporated the DID into the Configuration Group by changing the
       dymoAdminStatus object to an Instance Table.  This allows for the
       presence of multiple DYMO processes concurrent on the same
       router.

   2.  Added the dymoNotifObjectsGroup and its dymoSetNotifications
       object to allow for individual control of the DYMO Notifications.
       Updated the Conformance sections accordingly.

   3.  Renamed several of the Configuration Objects to be consistent
       with the naming within the current draft-ietf-manet-dymo-21.

Appendix B.  Open Issues

   This section contains the set of open issues related to the
   development and design of the DYMO-MIB.  This section will not be
   present in the final version of the MIB and will be removed once all
   the open issues have been resolved.

   1.  Work on the Security Section.  This MIB does have settable
       objects, but not sensitive objects (true?).

   2.  Work on the relationship to other MIBs, IF-MIB, NHDP-MIB.

   3.  Cleanup all the [TODOs] from the MIB template.
