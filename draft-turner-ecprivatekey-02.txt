Internet-Draft   Elliptic Curve Private Key Structure     December 2009 
    

Abstract 

   This document specifies the syntax and semantics for conveying 
   Elliptic Curve (EC) private key information.  This syntax and 
   semantics defined herein are based on a similar syntax and semantics 
   defined in Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG).  

1. Introduction 

   This document specifies a syntax and semantics for Elliptic Curve 
   (EC) private key information.  EC private key information includes a 
   private key and optionally parameters.  Additionally, it may include 
   the corresponding public key.  The syntax and semantics defined 
   herein are based on a similar syntax and semantics defined in 
   Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG) [SECG1]. 

   Most Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) mandate local key generation; 
   however, there are some PKIs that also support centralized key 
   generation (e.g., the public-private key pair is generated by a CA).  
   The structure defined in this document allows the entity that 
   generates the private and public keys to distribute the key pair and 
   optionally the associated domain parameters. 

   A scenario in which this syntax is useful distributes EC private keys 
   using PrivateKeyInfo, as defined in PKCS #8 [RFC5208]. Distributing 
   an EC private key with PKCS#8 [RFC5208] involves including: 
   a) id-ecPublicKey, id-ecDH, or id-ecMQV (from [RFC5480]) with the 
   namedCurve as the parameters in the privateKeyAlgorithm field 
   b) ECPrivateKey in the PrivateKey field, which is an OCTET STRING. 
   When the public key is included, it is present in the ECPrivateKey 
   publicKey field not in the PKCS#8 publicKey field. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3. Elliptic Curve Private Key Format 

   This section gives the syntax for an EC private key.  Computationally 
   an EC private key is an unsigned integer, but for representation, EC 
   private key information SHALL have ASN.1 type ECPrivateKey: 

   ECPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE { 
     version        INTEGER { ecPrivkeyVer1(1) } (ecPrivkeyVer1), 
     privateKey     OCTET STRING, 
     parameters [0] ECParameters {{ NamedCurve }} OPTIONAL, 
     publicKey  [1] BIT STRING OPTIONAL 
   } 

    The fields of type ECPrivateKey have the following meanings:  

    o version specifies the syntax version number of the elliptic curve 
     private key structure. For this version of the document, it SHALL 
     be set to ecPrivkeyVer1, which is of type INTEGER and whose value 
     is one (1). 

    o privateKey is the private key.  It is an octet string of length 
     ceiling (log2(n/8)) (where n is the order of the curve) obtained 
     from the unsigned integer via the Integer-to-Octet-String-
     Primitive (I2OSP) defined in [RFC3447]. 

    o parameters specifies the elliptic curve domain parameters 
     associated to the private key. The type ECParameters are discussed 
     in [RFC5480]. As specified in [RFC5480], only the namedCurve 
     CHOICE, which is an object identifier that fully identifies the 
     required values for a particular set of elliptic curve domain 
     parameters, is permitted. Though the ASN.1 indicates parameters is 
     OPTIONAL, implementations that conform to this document MUST 
     always include the parameters field. 

    o publicKey contains the elliptic curve public key associated with 
     the private key in question. The format of the public key is 
     specified in Section 2.2 of [RFC5480]. Though the ASN.1 indicates 
     publicKey is OPTIONAL, implementations that conform to this 
     document SHOULD always include the publicKey field. The publicKey 
     field can be omitted when the public key has been distributed via 
     another mechanism, which is beyond the scope of this document.  
     Given the private key and the parameters the public key can always 
     be recomputed, this field exists as a convenience to the consumer. 

4. Other Considerations 

   When generating a transfer encoding, generators SHOULD use DER 
   [X.690] and receivers SHOULD be prepared to handle BER [X.690] and 
   DER [X.690].

   Local storage of an unencrypted ECPrivateKey object is out of scope 
   of this document.  However, one popular format uses the .pem file 
   extension.  It is a PEM encoding, which is the Base64 encoding 
   [RFC4648], of the DER encoded ECPrivateKey object sandwiched between: 

   -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY----- 
   -----END EC PRIVATE KEY----- 

   Another local storage format uses the .der file extension.  In this 
   case, it is a DER [X.609] encoding of the ECPrivateKey object. 

   Local storage of an encrypted ECPrivateKey object is out of scope of 
   this document.  However, ECPrivateKey should be the format for the 
   plaintext key being encrypted, and DER encoding it will promote 
   interoperability if the key is encrypted for transport to another 
   party.  See [RFC5208]. 

5. Security Considerations 

   This structure does not protect the EC private key information in any 
   way.  This structure should be combined with a security protocol to 
   protect it.  

   Protection of the private-key information is vital to public-key 
   cryptography.  Disclosure of the private-key material to another 
   entity can lead to masquerades.  The encryption algorithm used in the 
   encryption process must be as 'strong' as the key it is protecting. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   None: All identifiers are already registered.  Please remove this 
   section prior to publication as an RFC.
