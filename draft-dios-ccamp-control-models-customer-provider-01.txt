 Terminology and Models for Control of Traffic Engineered Networks with
                       Client-Server Relationship
          draft-dios-ccamp-control-models-customer-provider-01

Abstract

   Different kinds of relationships can be established among
   interconnected Traffic Engineered Networks.  In particular, this
   document focuses on the case where there is a client-server relation
   between the network domains.  The domain interconnection is a policy
   and administrative boundary.  This informational document collects
   current terminology and provides a taxonomy for the posible control
   plane based operation models.

   Each control model defines, on the one hand, the level of information
   that the domain acting as client receives by control plane means from
   the domain acting as server and, on the other hand, the control model
   will determine what can be requested from the client domain to the
   server domain.

1.  Introduction

   Traffic Engineered Networks can be interconnected, establishing
   different types of relationships among them.  For example, both
   network can have a peering relation, where connections starting in
   one domain and end in the other domain.  This document is focused on
   the case where the interconnected network domains have a client-
   server relationship among them.  Such client-server relation comes
   from the two main points.  On the one hand, end-to-end services in
   the client network can be set up using services of a network acting
   as server.  On the other hand, the client-server relation comes from
   the fact that their interconnection is a policy and administrative
   boundary, limiting the amount of information allowed to be exchanged
   between networks.  In the case of interconnected TE domains where
   there is no administrative nor strict policy boundary between client
   and server (typically, just a technolgy change), the MLN/MRN model
   can be applied.

   The interface between the client and the server domain is typically
   called "User-to-Network Interface" (UNI), and regarded as signaling-
   only [RFC4208].  Due to the strict asociation of functionality to the
   UNI term, its exact scope has become highly controversial.  This
   document compiles different definitions of the term used so far and
   propose some terminology to serve as a foundation to move the work
   forward.

   What is more, the document compiles the possible operation models of
   client-server network from the control plane perspective.  Each
   control model defines, on the one hand, the level of information of
   the domain acting as client provides through the control plane to the
   domain acting as server.  On the other hand, the control model will
   determine what can be requested from the client domain to the server
   domain.

1.1.  Examples of Client-Server TE Network Domain Scenarios

   The most typical example of interconnected TE domains that follow a
   client-server relation is an IP/MPLS domain using the services of an
   optical OTN/WDM network.  Note that the interconnected domain can be
   part of the same organization, but with different administration.

   A particular network scenario that has attracted lot of attention
   from the industry is the IP/MPLS/OTN/WDM over WDM.  The client
   network is based on multi-layer routers able to set up packet-based
   TE connections over wavelengths.  The server network is a WDM optical
   network that provides the switching for the wavelenghts as well as
   restoration capabilities of the optical channels.

   Another example is MPLS over MPLS, where both client and server
   networks are able to set up packet based TE connections.  This is the
   case, for example, of carrier-over-carrier scenarios.

   Summing up, there number of applicable scenarios is wide.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Routing domain

   A routing domain is made of GMPLS enabled nodes (i.e., a network
   device including a GMPLS entity).  These nodes can be either edge
   nodes (i.e., hosts, ingress LSRs or egress LSRs), or internal LSRs.
   An example of non-PSC host is an SONET/SDH Terminal Multiplexer (TM).
   Another example is an SONET/SDH interface card within an IP router or
   ATM switch.

   A routing domain is characterized by being under the control of the
   same administration and by running a common set of protocols to
   exchange routing information

2.2.  Overlay of routing domains

   In an overlay environment we have a client routing domain and a
   server routing domain, each of which running its own routing protocol
   instance.  Connectivity in the client routing domain can be made by
   connectivity services of the server domain.

2.3.  Multilayer

   As per RFC 5212 "UA data plane layer is a collection of network
   resources capable of terminating and/or switching data traffic of a
   particular format [RFC4397].  These resources can be used for
   establishing LSPs for traffic delivery.  For example, VC-11 and
   VC4-64c represent two different layers."U

   In a Multilayer network, each layer can be or not a routing domain.
   In fact, a multi-layer network can be controled with a single control
   plane instance in which all resources are adverstised in the same IGP
   instance

Internet-Draft   Control Models for client-server netwks       July 2014


2.4.  Policy

   In an overlay network, policy is the set of rules that apply in the
   interface between two routing domains, and that restrict the level of
   information exchanged and the operations allowed.  The policy
   decisions obey to confidentiality reasons (typically, the routing
   domains operate under the control of different administrations) and
   scalability (to avoid excessive flow of information that collapse the
   processing capacity of the nodes)

   An example of policy example, visibility of the server domain could
   be restricted to the client domain.

2.5.  Client Domain - Server Domain Interface

   The interface between the client and the server domain is typically
   called "User-to-Network Interface" (UNI).  However, the term "UNI"
   has been used in different contexts and SDOs.  As a consequence, the
   exact definition of UNI and the functionalities included depend on
   the application.  Bellow, as a reference, it is shown a set of the
   different definitions of UNI.

2.5.1.  UNI in IP over Optical Networks

   [RFC3717] says: "The client-optical internetwork interface (UNI)
   represents a service boundary between the client (e.g., IP router)
   and the optical network.  The client and server (optical network) are
   essentially two different roles: the client role requests a service
   connection from a server; the server role establishes the connection
   to fulfill the service request -- provided all relevant admission
   control conditions are satisfied."

   In other words, this definition refers to a signaling protocol
   between two administrative domains with a client-server relationship.
   It is agnostic to the existence of a data plane client-server
   relationship and to the side(s) of the boundary where it may happen,
   if any.

2.5.2.  ITU-T Definition of UNI

   ITU-T has defined the term UNI in the context of control plane.
   [G.807] [G.8081]  (ITU-T): "User-Network Interface for the control
   plane (UNI): A bidirectional signaling interface between service
   requester and service server control plane entities."

   The terms "requester/provider" are used to refer to the relationship.

Internet-Draft   Control Models for client-server netwks       July 2014


2.5.3.  OIF Definition of UNI

   UNI: "The service control interface between a client device and the
   transport network."

   UNI-C: "The logical entity that terminates UNI signalling on the
   client device side."

   UNI-N: "The logical entity that terminates UNI signalling on the
   transport network side."

   The terms "client/transport" and "client/network" are used to refer
   to the relationship.

2.5.4.  Proposed Vocabulary

   As listed above, the existing terminology is far from unique.  To
   avoid overloaded concepts, this document proposes to use the "client/
   server" terms.

   Unless stated, this document focuses on control protocol exchanges
   and their uses across administrative boundaries for client-server
   interconnection.  Data plane transition and/or client-server
   relationship may not be aligned with the boundary.

2.5.4.1.  Client network

   A Client network is defined as a network domain able to request a
   connectivity service to a server network domain across an
   administrative boundary.

2.5.4.2.  Server network

   A Server network is defined as a network domain able to deliver
   connectivity services to a client network domain across an
   administrative boundary.

2.5.4.3.  Client-Server Control Plane Interface

   The control plane interface between the client network domain and the
   server network domain convey a set of control functionalities that
   help to operate such kind of networks.  The exact functionalities of
   this Interface (and then the level of information exchanged) depend
   on the chosen control model.  This document presents a taxonomy with
   the possible control models.

2.6.  Reachability

   In graph theory, reachability refers to the ability to get from one
   vertex to another within a graph.  Thus, a vertex can reach another
   vertex if there exists a sequence of adjacent vertices which starts
   with the source vertex and ends with the destination vertex.

   The document [draft-farrel-interconnected-te-info-exchange-04]
   provides the definition of what is reachability for client-server
   networks.  [EDITOR's note: Text from draft-farrel-interconnected-te-
   info-exchange has been borrowed for this first version.  Duplicated
   text will be deleted at later stages]

   In an IP network, reachability is the ability to deliver a packet to
   a specific address or prefix.  That is, the existence of an IP path
   to that address or prefix.  TE reachability is the ability to reach a
   specific address along a TE path.

   In the context of Traffic Engineered networks with client and server
   relationships, we can define several types of reachability:
   [draft-farrel-interconnected-te-info-exchange-04]

2.6.1.  Unqualified Reachability

   Two client domain nodes are said to be reachable if, either there
   exists at least one path through the client domain that connects both
   nodes, or, in the case that there is no path exclusively through the
   client domain network, there exists al least one path connecting
   nodes of client and server domain by which both client nodes can be
   connected.

   In the case of basic reachability, it is only known that it is
   possible to connect the nodes, but there is no notion of the details
   of such possible connections, such as, for example, bandwidth
   available or performance metrics.  Also, the exact path to connect
   both nodes is not known to the client network.  Note that, even if
   two nodes are reachable, there may not be enough resources for a
   desired TE connection with specific TE constraints.

2.6.2.  Qualified Reachability

   In this case, on top of the basic reachability, it is known some TE
   attributes of the possible connection (or connections).  Examples of
   such attributes are: TE metrics, hop count, available bandwidth,
   delay, SRLG list.  Note that this information is specific per
   connection.  Thus, if there are several possible TE paths, there are
   a set of attributes.

Internet-Draft   Control Models for client-server netwks       July 2014


2.6.3.  Qualified Reachability with associated potential TE path

   In this particular case, on top of the qualified reachability, there
   exists an associated potential TE path that satisfies the TE
   connection between two client nodes.  Thus, in this case, the client
   Network has the information that there exists a TE path that can be
   set up at any time.

3.  Control Models

   The control of the networks formed by interconnected domains with a
   client-server relations between them can be done following different
   models.  Each control model defines, on the one hand, the level of
   information that the domain acting as client receives by control
   plane means about the services given by the domain acting as server.
   This information, for example, can vary from a complete lack of
   information, so the client domain only knows that it could be
   possible to reach another point of its domain via the server network,
   to a detailed view on the possibilities offered by the server
   network.  The level of detail of this information will determine
   which information is exchanged between both networks.  On the other
   hand, the control model will determine what can be requested from the
   client domain to the server domain.  As an example, the most basic
   use is specifying just the end-points to connect.  Other cases may
   include the possibility to request a service specifying a set of
   constraints, like bandwidth, diversity, an optimization criteria,
   etc.

   Which control model to choose depends on several factors.  For the
   network operators, the main concern will be related to the level of
   trustness and relationship between client and server domains.  Also,
   one key factor to take into account is the protocol interoperability.
   Note that, equipment in the interconnected domains may be from
   different technologies (but not necessarily) and are likely to use
   different implementations.  The higher the level of functionality
   included in the control plane, the higher the protocol
   interoperability requirements, as it will force all implementations
   to support many functionality.  Finally, scalability, that is, the
   ability of the control plane to provide the same functionality
   regarding the number of equipment, needs to be taken into account:
   the amount of information in each option will have different limits
   in terms on number of interconnected nodes.

3.1.  Signaling Only

   This first model considers that the sole functionality allowed in the
   control plane is signaling, that is the ability to request services
   from client to server domain.



Gonzalez de Dios, et al.Expires January 22, 2015                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft   Control Models for client-server netwks       July 2014


   In this model, the control plane does not provide a priori hints to
   the client domain about the state of the server domain (e.g.,
   resource availability).  This model does not preclude that, by other
   means like the management plane, the client domain knows what is
   possible or not.  Such management actions are out of the scope of the
   control plane.  Thus, it is perfectly feasible that the reachability
   information is provided either statically or by some management
   platform.

   The most basic case relies on sending a loose ERO from the client,
   specifying the edges of the connection.

   In a trusted interconnection mode, the signaling allows the client
   domain to provide a full ERO, given to the client network by external
   tools.

3.1.1.  Signaling with Requirements

   The control plane may allow to express complex requests to the server
   domain.  That is, through the signaling protocol, it is allowed to
   not only request a connection between two points of the client
   domain, but also to include some constraints: e.g., minimum
   bandwidth, maximum delay, optimization criteria, or request diversity
   from another service.  The policy at the edges of the server network
   will determine which constraints are accepted.  Note the many of the
   requirements that can be expressed in the request are similar to what
   would be asked to a path computation function.

3.1.2.  Signaling with Collection

   Even though the only protocol enabled is signaling, it may be
   beneficial for the client domain to be able to know some updated
   information of the services that it has requested to the server.
   Thus, this case considers the possibility that, through the signaling
   protocol, the client domain can receive some information.  What
   information it is allowed to collect will be determined by the policy
   of the server domain.

3.2.  Signaling and Reachability Model

   This second model considers that, in addition to signaling, the
   client domain receives some reachability information through a
   control plane mechanism.

Internet-Draft   Control Models for client-server netwks       July 2014


3.2.1.  Signalling + Basic Reachability

   In this particular case, through control plane mechanisms, the client
   domain knows whether it is possible to reach a remote end point.  The
   client domain should also remain aware of this information if there
   are failures in the server domain or if the associated capacity has
   been filled.

3.2.2.  Signalling + Qualified Reachability

   The control plane will provide information not only about the
   possibility to reach a remote end point, but also some TE information
   of possible connections.  For example, the client domain will know
   that it is possible to reach another point with some bandwidth or
   delay.  Note that, in this case, such information is sent by control
   plane mechanisms (not statically configured by managament plane).

3.2.3.  Signalling + Qualified Reachability + Potential Services

   In addition to the TE information of the possible connections between
   two points, the control plane will also provide to the client domain
   information about potential server's services which could satisfy
   given requirements.  By control plane procedures, the client domain
   can request, with respect to its needs, a service using such
   potential service and make high level path selection within the
   server domain.

3.3.  Service Atributes vs service constraints

   When asking for the setup of a service in the server domain, the
   client domain can put constraints on such request.  Constraints can
   consist on the utilization of a path that minimizes a given metric
   (e.g.  TE metric or end to end delay) or on a set of lower/upper
   bounds that must be followed (e.g. maximum number of hops or maximum
   end to end delay).  Once the service has been provisioned (or just
   its paths computed), it is possible to identify (e.g. measure or
   collect) the attributes that characterize such service.  For example
   the path has been computed so to meet the constraint of maximum end
   to end delay of 20ms, while one of its attributes is the effective
   end to end delay that is experimented along its path, which could be
   of e.g. 14 ms.  Other examples of constraints and attributes can be
   found in path diversity.  A typical constraint in LSP provisioning is
   diversity, which is a constraint, but then attributes of the two
   diverse LSPs like e.g.  SRLGs can be collected.  Both constraints and
   attributes need to be exchanged between a client and a server domain.

3.4.  Other Models

3.4.1.  Multi-Layer Networks / Multi-Region Networks

   MLN/MRN extensions to control protocols have been defined.  They are
   well scoped for client and server data plane domains without
   administrative boundary between them.  This allows MLN nodes to
   participate in common control protocol instances.  There is a full
   set of mechanisms to operate such networks [Editor's note: add refs
   to MLN/MRN)].  Typical use cases are switches combining both low- and
   high-order Sonet/SDH, or both ODUk and wavelengths.

   However, MLN/MRN assumes no policy boundary between client and server
   domains.  Thus, the level of information exchanged is not restricted,
   and full interoperability of both the signaling and routing protocols
   is required.

3.4.2.  Management Model

   In this particular case, the role of the control plane is limited to
   operate independently in each of the domains.  [Editor's note: Common
   Control... WG => do we leave it?]

4.  Abstraction

   Abstraction:

   - a physical topology is made of actual nodes interconnected by
   existing links, i.e. without abstraction;

   - a virtual topology is made of nodes and/or links which may (or may
   not) exist or be instanciated to look the same as the advertised
   abstraction;

   - a potential topology is made of nodes and/or links which are not
   existing at advertising time but could be instantiated on demand,
   i.e. a virtual topology which can be actually provided by a network.
