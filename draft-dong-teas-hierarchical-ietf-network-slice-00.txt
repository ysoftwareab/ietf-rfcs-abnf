         Considerations about Hierarchical IETF Network Slices
           draft-dong-teas-hierarchical-ietf-network-slice-00

Abstract

   Network slicing is targeted at existing or emerging customers or
   services which may request for network connectivity services with a
   specific set of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level
   Expectations (SLEs).  The framework of IETF network slice can support
   hierarchical network slicing.  And in some network scenarios, there
   may be requirements for the deployment of hierarchical network
   slices.

   This document describes the typical scenarios of hierarchical IETF
   network slices, and provides the considerations and requirements on
   the technologies in different network planes to support hierarchical
   network slicing.

1.  Introduction

   Network slicing is targeted at existing or emerging customers or
   services which may request for network connectivity services with a
   specific set of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level
   Expectations (SLEs).  The concept and general framework of IETF
   network slice are described in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices].
   [I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn] describes the framework and technologies
   which can be used for IETF network slice realization by utilizing VPN
   and Traffic Engineering (TE) mechanisms with enhancements that
   specific services require over traditional VPNs.

Internet-Draft      Hierarchical IETF Network Slices        October 2021


   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slices] mentions that IETF Network Slices
   may be combined hierarchically, which means that a network slice may
   itself be further sliced.  However, there is no detailed description
   about hierarchical IETF network slices scenarios and requirements.

   This document describes the typical scenarios in which the deployment
   of hierarchical IETF network slices may be needed.  This document
   also provides the considerations and requirements on the technologies
   in different network planes to support hierarchical network slicing.

2.  Scenarios of Hierarchical IETF Network Slices

   In this section, several network scenarios of hierarchical IETF
   network slicing are introduced.

2.1.  Per-Customer Network Slices in an Industrial Network Slice

   One of the typical network slice deployment is in the multi-
   industrial network case, in which a physical network is used to
   deliver services of multiple vertical industries.  Separate IETF
   network slices are provided for different industries, such as health-
   care, education, manufacturing, governmental affairs, etc.  Then
   within the network slice of a specific industry, there may be need to
   create separate network slices for some or all of the customers
   within this industry.

   For example, within the education network slice, some of the
   universities may require for a separate network slice to connect with
   a set of the branch campuses.  Another examples is within the health-
   care network slice, some of the hospitals may require for a separate
   network slice for the connectivity and services between a set of the
   branch hospitals.

2.2.  Per-application Network Slices in a Customer Network Slice

   Another network slice deployment case is to provide dedicated IETF
   network slices for some important customers as the first-level
   network slices.  While the customers may require to further split
   their network slices into different sub-network slices for different
   applications.

   For example, a network slice for a hospital may be further divided to
   carry different type of medical services, such as remote patient
   monitoring, remote ultrasound diagnose, medical image transmission
   etc.

2.3.  Network Slice Services in a Wholesale Network Slice

   IETF network slice can also be delivered as a wholesale service to
   other network operators.  In this case a network operator can be the
   customer of a network slice, and it may also need to deliver IETF
   network slice services to its customers.  This is similar to the
   Carrier's Carrier VPN service mode, while some additional requirement
   on the SLOs and SLEs may be required by the second-level network
   slice customer.

3.  Considerations about Hierarchical Network Slice Realization

   To support the realization of hierarchical network slices, it is
   expected that there will be specific requirements on the technologies
   used in each network plane.  In this section, the requirements of
   hierarchical network slicing on the forwarding resource partitioning,
   the data plane encapsulations, the control plane protocols and the
   management plane are analyzed.

3.1.  Forwarding Resource Partitioning

   For the realization of IETF network slices, the network resources in
   the underlying forwarding plane needs to be partitioned into
   different subsets, each subset is used to build the underlay
   construct to support one or a group of IETF network slice services.
   In order to support hierarchical network slices, the forwarding plane
   resources needs to be able to be partitioned in a hierarchical
   manner.  Taking a two-level hierarchical network slice as an example,
   the bandwidth resource of a physical interface needs to be
   partitioned in two levels.  There can be different options in the
   modeling the interface bandwidth resource partitioning.

   The first option is to treat the first-level network resource
   partitions as a set of layer-3 interfaces or sub-interfaces with
   dedicated network resources, and the second-level network resource
   partitions are represented as virtual layer-2 data channels, as shown
   in the figure below:

   The second option is to treat the first-level network resource
   partitions as a virtual layer-2 sub-interface of the layer-3
   interface, and the second-level network resource partition is
   represented as a virtual data channel under the virtual layer-2 sub-
   interface, as shown in the figure below:

   The options of the resource partition modeling may have impact to the
   amount of information to be distributed in the control plane.
   Depends on the network deployment requirements, different resource
   partition modeling options may be used.

3.2.  Data Plane Identifiers

   Traffic of IETF network slices can be steered into the corresponding
   virtual underlay construct based on one or multiple fields in the
   data packet, so that the set of network resources are used for
   processing and forwarding the packet.  On the network edge nodes,
   traffic flows can be classified and mapped to IETF network slices
   based on the matching rules according to operators' local policy.
   While on the intermediate nodes, a dedicated data plane identifier
   can facilitate the identification of the set of network resources
   associated with the virtual underlay on the network nodes for packet
   processing.

   For hierarchical network slices, such data plane identifiers may need
   to be able to identify both the first-level resource partition and
   the second-level resource partition.  There are several options for
   the data plane resource identifier for hierarchical network slices.

   The first option is to use a unified identifier for both the first-
   level resource partition and the second-level resource partition.  In
   this case, the first-level resource partitions and the second-level
   resource partitions are identified by distinct identifier values.

                +-----------------------------------------+
                | Unified Resource ID for different levels|
                +-----------------------------------------+

               Figure 6. Unified Resource ID

   The second option is to use a hierarchical identifier for the first-
   level resource partition and the second level resource partition.  In
   this case, the first part of the Resource ID is used to identify the
   first-level resource partition, and the second part of the resource
   ID is used to identify the second-level resource partition.  Depends
   on the data plane technologies used, the hierarchical resource
   identifier may be positioned in a continuous field in the packet, or
   maybe positioned in separate fields.

                +--------------------+--------------------+
                | Level-1 Resource ID| Level-2 Resource ID|
                +--------------------+--------------------+

               Figure 7. Hierarchical Resource ID


3.3.  Control Plane

   The control plane may be used for the distribution of the resource
   partition information and the associated data plane identifiers among
   the network nodes and to the network controller.  With different
   resource partition modeling, the information may be advertised as
   either layer-3 or layer-2 network information, which can have
   different scalability implications to the control plane.  As the
   number of both the level-1 network slices and level-2 network slices
   increases, some control plane mechanisms may be needed to adopt to
   the amount of network slice information to be advertised.

3.4.  Management Plane

   Depends on the scenarios of hierarchical network slicing, the
   management system of network operator may need to support additional
   functions and procedures for the life-cycle management of
   hierarchical network slices.  The detailed analysis about the
   requirement on management plane is for further study.
