Abstract


   Until DNSSEC is fully deployed, so-called "islands of trust" will
   exist.  This will lead to a large number of keys with no method
   within DNSSEC to manage the keys.  This proposal seeks to address
   that issue using existing mechanisms to allow cross-signing of root
   (i.e.  roots of islands) keys.  This cross-signing of keys creates a
   non-hierarchical web of trust which permits the efficient gathering
   and validation of trust anchors.

1.  Introduction


   When DNSSEC signatures are validated the validators will follow a
   chain of authority from a pre-configured trust anchor to the data
   that is to be validated.  The DNSSEC protocol[dnssecbis-protocol]
   clearly describes how these chains of trust are to be established but
   does not address the issue of the distribution of the trust anchors.


   This document describes how an X.509 based public key infrastructure
   can be used to bootstrap the configuratation of a set of trust
   anchors.  SEP keys are stored in certificates that are signed by the
   registries' Certificate Authorities.  The system allows registries to
   indicate levels of trust which allows for prudent cross-signing.


   The Certificate Authority and the certificates are discussed in
   Section 2 and Section 3.  Section 4 and Section 5 describe how the
   certificates are published.  Section 6 describes how the certificates
   are used to establish the trust-anchors.


   In this document the term secure entry point (SEP) key is used to
   describe the (sub)set of public key(s) that is intended as a secure
   entry point into the zone [RFC3757].  The term Island of security, or
   island for short, is used for a zone for which one of the SEP keys
   are used as a trust-anchor and which is therefore the start of a
   chain of authority.


2.  Island CAs


   The root of each island will publish an X.509 CA certificate.  This
   will be a long-term, self-signed certificate, known as the Island
   Root CA (IRCA).  This CA will then be used to create two subsidiary
   CAs, each with a shorter expiry, known as the High Assurance Island
   CA and the Low Assurance Island CA.


   Each island will have a set of requirements for cross-signing, one
   for low assurance and one for high assurance.  The reason for having
   two is to allow cross-signing of keys that the island's operators do
   not have high confidence in without exposing them to accusations of
   insufficient prudence.


3.  Key Signing


   Each island will issue a certificate signed by the Island Root CA for
   each of its own SEPs.


   For each other island that meets the island's requirements for
   cross-signing, the island will issue certificates for their SEPs
   signed by either the Low or High Assurance Island CA, as appropriate.

   Each certificate issued will contain an X.509v3 extension with the
   name of the domain associated with the signed public key.


   Optionally, an IRCA or one of its subsidiaries might also sign the
   public key of the IRCA of other islands - this would require a high
   degree of trust, though.  It also steps beyond the bounds of what can
   be easily done with standard X.509.


4.  Publication of Certificates


   Each island will maintain a URL (known as the Island Publication URL
   or IPU) where all current certificates issued by any of its CAs are
   available.  This URL may also have a collection of certificates
   issued by other island CAs and also the CA certificates themselves of
   other islands.  Note, however, that the presence of a certificate
   does not indicate any kind of trust in it - that is done purely by
   the certificate signatures.


5.  Location of Island Publication URL


   The location of each IPU will be held in the IRCA using an X.509v3
   certificate extension registered for the purpose.


6.  Use of Certificates


   A resolver wishing to bootstrap its collection of trust anchors need
   only choose a small set of IRCAs to trust (or, with luck, a single
   one).  Once it has done so, it can extract the IPU from the CA
   certificate, use HTTP to retrieve the certificate collection
   available there, check their (chained) signatures, extract the public
   keys from the certificates and use these as the initial set of SEPs
   for the domains named in the certificates.


   Once the initial set of certificates has been retrieved, this process
   can be followed recursively for other IRCAs retrieved.  Also, the set
   of trusted IRCAs could be expanded to include some or all of the
   retrieved IRCAs.


   After the set of trusted trust anchors have been established, in-band
   mechanisms can be used to keep them up to date.  If for some reason
   the set of trust anchors becomes too stale to update (for example,
   because the device has been offline for an extended period), then the
   process can be repeated from the start.


7.  Variations


   Instead of a URL, the certificate could contain a domain name and
   socket number.

8.  Security Non-issues


   Note that DNSSEC is not required to secure the domain names used for
   certificate retrieval, since the signature of the selected IRCA(s)
   will be sufficient to validate the retrieved certificates.
