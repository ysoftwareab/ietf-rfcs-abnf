1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a 
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 
   2580 [RFC2580].

2.  Overview

   This document describes an SNMP MIB module for managing VDSL Lines.
   These definitions are based upon the specifications for VDSL as 
   defined in T1E1, ETSI, and ITU documentation [T1E1311, T1E1011, 
   T1E1013, ETSI2701, ETSI2702, ITU9931, ITU9971].

   The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission,
   as discussed in the MIB-2 Integration (RFC 2863 [RFC2863]) section 
   of this document.  

2.1  Relationship of the VDSL Line MIB Module to other MIB Modules

INTERNET-DRAFT               VDSL-LINE MIB                     June 2003

   described in RFCs.  Specifically, IF-MIB as presented in RFC 2863
   [RFC2863] is discussed.

2.1.1  General IF-MIB Integration (RFC 2863)

   The VDSL Line MIB specifies the detailed attributes of a data
   interface.  As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2863 [RFC2863].
   The IANA has assigned the following ifType to VDSL:

   IANAifType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       ...

   SYNTAX INTEGER {
       ...
       vdsl(97), -- Very H-speed Digital Subscrib.  Loop
       ...
       }

   Additionally, a VDSL line may contain an optional fast channel
   and an optional interleaved channel which also integrate into RFC 
   2863 [RFC2863].  The IANA has assigned the following ifTypes to 
   these channels:

   IANAifType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       ...
   SYNTAX INTEGER {
       ...
       interleave (124), -- Interleave channel
       fast (125),       -- Fast channel
       ...
       }

2.1.2  Usage of ifTable

   The MIB branch identified by this ifType contains tables appropriate
   for this interface type.  Most such tables extend the ifEntry table,
   and are indexed by ifIndex.  For interfaces in systems implementing
   this MIB, those table entries indexed by ifIndex MUST be persistent.

   The following attributes are part of the mandatory ifGeneral group 
   in RFC 2863 [RFC2863], and are not duplicated in the VDSL Line MIB.

   ===================================================================
       ifIndex                  Interface index.

       ifDescr                  See interfaces MIB [RFC2863].

       ifType                   vdsl(97),
                                interleaved(124), or
                                fast(125)

       ifSpeed                  Set as appropriate.

2.2.2 Textual Conventions

   The following textual conventions are defined to reflect the line 
   topology in the MIB (further discussed in the following section)
   and to define the behavior of the statistics to be maintained
   by an agent.

   o    VdslLineCodingType :

   Attributes with this syntax identify the line coding used.
   Specified as an INTEGER, the three values are:

   other(1)  -- none of the following
   mcm(2)    -- Multiple Carrier Modulation 
   scm(3)    -- Single Carrier Modulation

   o    VdslLineEntity :

   Attributes with this syntax reference the two sides of a line.
   Specified as an INTEGER, the two values are:

   vtuc(1)  -- central site transceiver 
   vtur(2)  -- remote site transceiver 

2.3  Structure

   The MIB is structured into the following MIB groups:

   o   vdslGroup :

   This group supports all line code independent MIB objects found
   in this MIB.  The following tables contain objects permitted for
   ifType vdsl(97):

      - vdslLineTable 
      - vdslPhysTable 
      - vdslPerfDataTable
      - vdslPerfIntervalTable
      - vdslPerf1DayIntervalTable
      - vdslLineConfProfileTable
      - vdslLineAlarmConfProfileTable 

   The following tables contain objects permitted for ifTypes 
   interleaved(124) and (fast):

      - vdslChanTable 
      - vdslChanPerfDataTable
      - vdslChanPerfIntervalTable
      - vdslChanPerf1DayIntervalTable

   Figure 2, below, displays the relationship of the tables in the
   vdslGroup to ifEntry (and each other):

   o   vdslNotificationGroup :

   This group contains definitions of VDSL line notifications.  Section 
   2.6, below, presents greater detail on the notifications defined
   within the MIB module.

2.3.1  Line Topology

   A VDSL Line consists of two units - a Vtuc (the central tranceiver
   unit) and a Vtur (the remote transceiver unit).  

             <-- Network Side   Customer Side -->

             |<////////// VDSL Line ///////////>|

2.4  Counters, Interval Buckets and Thresholds

   For Loss of Frame (lof), Loss of Link (lol), Loss of Signal (los),
   and Loss of Power (lpr), Errored Seconds (ES), Severely Errored
   Seconds (SES), and Unavailable Seconds (UAS) there are event 
   counters, current 15-minute, 0 to 96 15-minute history bucket(s),

INTERNET-DRAFT               VDSL-LINE MIB                     June 2003

   and 0 to 30 1-day history bucket(s) of "interval-counters".  Each
   current 15-minute event bucket has an associated threshold 
   notification.

   Each of these counters uses the textual conventions defined in the
   HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFCXXXX].  The HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB defines 64-
--- RFC Ed: please replace XXXX with the RFC number assigned to the
--- accompanying HC-TC MIB
   bit versions of the textual conventions found in RFC 2493 [RFC2493].

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute interval and any wall clock; 
   however, some implementations may align the fifteen minute intervals 
   with quarter hours.  Likewise, an implementation may choose to align 
   one day intervals with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when a Vtu is reinitialized, only when the
   agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside
   the scope of this MIB module).

2.5  Profiles

   As a managed node can handle a large number of Vtus, (e.g., hundreds
   or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on 
   every Vtu may become burdensome.  Moreover, most lines are 
   provisioned identically with the same set of parameters.  To 
   simplify the provisioning process, this MIB makes use of profiles.  
   A profile is a set of parameters that can be shared by multiple 
   lines using the same configuration.

   The following profiles are used in this MIB module:

   o   Line Configuration Profiles - Line configuration profiles 
       contain parameters for configuring VDSL lines.  They are defined 
       in the vdslLineConfProfileTable.

   o   Alarm Configuration Profiles - These profiles contain parameters 
       for configuring alarm thresholds for VDSL transceivers.  These 
       profiles are defined in the vdslLineAlarmConfProfileTable.

   One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single
   profile by setting its vdslLineConfProfile objects to the value of 
   this profile.  If a change is made to the profile, all lines that 
   refer to it will be reconfigured to the changed parameters.  Before
   a profile can be deleted or taken out of service it must be first 
   unreferenced from all associated lines.

   Implementations MUST provide a default profile with an index value 
   of 'DEFVAL' for each profile type.  The values of the associated 
   parameters will be vendor specific unless otherwise indicated in 
   this document.  Before a line's profiles have been set, these 
   profiles will be automatically used by setting vdslLineConfProfile

INTERNET-DRAFT               VDSL-LINE MIB                     June 2003

   and vdslLineAlarmConfProfile to 'DEFVAL' where appropriate.  This
   default profile name, 'DEFVAL', is considered reserved in the 
   context of profiles defined in this MIB module.

   Profiles are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically using the
   profile name and profile row status in each of the ten profile
   tables (nine line configuration tables and one alarm configuration
   table).

   Profile changes MUST take effect immediately.  These changes MAY
   result in a restart (hard reset or soft restart) of the units on the
   line.

2.6  Notifications

   The ability to generate the SNMP notifications coldStart/WarmStart
   (per [RFC3418]) which are per agent (e.g., per Digital Subscriber 
   Line Access Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a device), and 
   linkUp/linkDown (per [RFC2863]) which are per interface (i.e., VDSL 
   line) is required.

   The notifications defined in this MIB are for initialization failure
   and for the threshold crossings associated with the following 
   events: lof, lol, los, lpr, ES, SES, and UAS.  Each threshold has 
   its own enable/threshold value.  When that value is 0, the 
   notification is disabled.

   A linkDown notification MAY be generated whenever any of lof, lol,
   los, lpr, ES, SES, or UAS threshold crossing event (as defined
   in this MIB module) occurs.  The corresponding linkUp notification
   MAY be sent when all link failure conditions are cleared.

   The vdslCurrStatus is a bitmask representing all outstanding error 
   conditions associated with a particular VDSL transceiver.  Note that
   since status of remote transceivers is obtained via the EOC, this 
   information may be unavailable for units that are unreachable via 
   EOC during a line error condition.  Therefore, not all conditions 
   may always be included in its current status.  Notifications 
   corresponding to the bit fields in this object are defined.

   A threshold notification occurs whenever the corresponding current 
   15-minute interval error counter becomes equal to, or exceeds the 
   threshold value.  One notification may be sent per interval per 
   interface.  Since the current 15-minute counter are reset to 0 every 
   15 minutes, if the condition persists, the notification may recur as 
   often as every 15 minutes.  For example, to get a notification 
   whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at most once every 15 
   minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1.  The agent will 
   generate a notification when the event originally occurs.

   Note that the Network Management System, or NMS, may receive a 
   linkDown notification, as well, if enabled (via

   ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable [RFC2863]).  At the beginning of the next 15
   minute interval, the counter is reset.  When the first second goes 
   by and the event occurs, the current interval bucket will be 1, 
   which equals the threshold and the notification will be sent again.

    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module defining objects for the management of a pair 
        of VDSL transceivers at each end of the VDSL line.  Each such
        line has an entry in an ifTable which may include multiple 
        transceiver lines.  An agent may reside at either end of the 
        VDSL line.  However, the MIB is designed to require no 
        management communication between them beyond that inherent in
        the low-level VDSL line protocol.  The agent may monitor and 
        control this protocol for its needs.

        VDSL lines may support optional Fast or Interleaved channels.
        If these are supported, additional entries corresponding to the
        supported channels must be created in the ifTable.  Thus a VDSL
        line that supports both channels will have three entries in the
        ifTable, one for each physical, fast, and interleaved, whose
        ifType values are equal to vdsl(97), fast(125), and

            If the line is to be channelized, the value will be other
            than noChannel(1).

            This configuration can be activated only during start-up.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   VDSL layer connectivity from the Vtur will permit the subscriber 
   to manipulate both the VDSL link directly and the VDSL embedded

   operations channel (EOC) for their own loop.  For example, unchecked 
   or unfiltered fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could 
   generate sufficient notifications to potentially overwhelm either 
   the management interface to the network or the element manager.  

   For this reason, there are a number of managed objects in this MIB 
   that may contain sensitive information.  These are:

        vdslThresh15MinLofs
        vdslThresh15MinLoss
        vdslThresh15MinLprs
        vdslThresh15MinLols
        vdslThresh15MinESs
        vdslThresh15MinSESs
        vdslThresh15MinUASs

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending 
   them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide 
   features for such a secure environment.

   Further, notifications generated by agents implementing this MIB
   will contain the above threshold information.  

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) objects
   which utilize the textual conventions defined in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of a MIB module which utilizes the textual conventions
   defined in this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
