Abstract

   This document describes the Service Agent service type.  Service
   Agents are one of three types of agents used in the Service Location
   Protocol, Version 2 [1].  The Service Agent advertises all services
   on a given host which have been enabled to use SLPv2.

1. Introduction

   This document provides a Service Template for Service Agents. 
   Service templates are defined in [2].  

   SLPv2 may be used to discover Service Agents.  This template defines
   the attributes which SLP User Agents may use to select the
   appropriate service agent for its needs.

2. The "service agent" Service Type

  description=
    This defines the service-agent service type.  This service is
    used by SLPv2 User Agents to do service discovery in the absense
    of SLPv2 Directory Agents.  By discovering all SLPv2 Service
    Agents, the User Agents know both their locations (so they may
    send unicast requests to them) and the scopes they support.
    Service Agent discovery and the use of service:service-agent
    URLs is defined in [1].

  url-syntax=
    url-path= ; The URL of the service agent.  Defined in [1].

  service-type=string M L
  ; The service types advertised by the Service Agent

3. Security Considerations

  Authentication of Service Agent URLs is possible within the context
  of SLPv2 [1].  Service Agent URLs may be used by SLPv2 UAs.  The
  use of the service information included in this template allows UAs
  to select a subset of all SLPv2 SAs.  If SLPv2 security mechanisms
  are not used, the UAs will have no guarantee these services actually
  conform to the selected subset.
