                 draft-ietf-lpwan-schc-compound-ack-00

Abstract

   The present document describes an extension to the SCHC (Static
   Header Compression and Fragmentation) protocol [RFC8724].  It defines
   a SCHC Compound ACK message format, which is intended to reduce the
   number of downlink transmissions (i.e., SCHC ACKs) by accumulating
   bitmaps of several windows in a single SCHC message (i.e., the SCHC
   Compound ACK).

   The message format is generic, and can be used for instance by any
   the four LWPAN technologies defined in [RFC8376], being Sigfox,
   LoRaWAN, NB-IoT and IEEE 802.15.4w.

1.  Introduction

   The Generic Framework for Static Context Header Compression and
   Fragmentation (SCHC) specification [RFC8724] describes two
   mechanisms: i) an application header compression scheme, and ii) a
   frame fragmentation and loss recovery functionality.  Either can be
   used on top of radio technologies such as the four LWPAN defined in
   [RFC8376], being Sigfox, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT and IEEE 802.15.4w.  These
   LPWANs have similar characteristics such as star-oriented topologies,
   network architecture, connected devices with built-in applications,
   etc.

   SCHC offers a great level of flexibility to accommodate all these
   LPWAN technologies.  Even though there are a great number of
   similarities between them, some differences exist with respect to the
   transmission characteristics, payload sizes, etc.  Hence, there are
   optimal parameters and modes of operation that can be used when SCHC
   is used on top of a specific LPWAN technology.

Internet-Draft              SCHC Compound ACK                  July 2021


   The present document describes an extension to the SCHC protocol.  It
   defines a SCHC Compound ACK format, which is intended to reduce the
   number of downlink transmissions (i.e., SCHC ACKs) in the ACK-on-
   Error mode of SCHC.  The SCHC Compound ACK extends the SCHC ACK
   message format so that it can contain several bitmaps, each bitmap
   being identified by its corresponding window number.

   The SCHC Compound ACK:

   o  provides feedback only for windows with fragment losses,

   o  has a variable size that depends on the number of windows with
      fragment losses being reported in the single Compound SCHC ACK,

   o  includes the window number (i.e., W) of each bitmap,

   o  has the same SCHC ACK format defined in [RFC8724] when only one
      window with losses is reported,

   o  might not cover all windows with fragment losses of a SCHC Packet,

   o  is distinguishable from the SCHC Receiver-Abort.

2.  Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and
   mechanisms defined in [RFC8376] and in [RFC8724].

3.  SCHC Compound ACK

   The SCHC Compound ACK is a SCHC ACK message that can contain several
   bitmaps, each bitmap being identified by its corresponding window
   number.

   When the ACK-on-Error mode is used for uplink fragmentation, SCHC
   Compound ACKs MAY be used in the downlink responses.

   The SCHC Compound ACK groups the window number (W) with its
   corresponding bitmap.  The included window numbers and corresponding
   bitmaps MUST be ordered from the lowest-numbered to the highest-
   numbered window.

3.1.  SCHC Compound ACK Message Format

   Figure 1 shows the regular SCHC ACK format when all fragments have
   been correctly received (C=1), as defined in [RFC8724].

                  |- SCHC ACK Header --|
                  + -------+---+------ + ------------ +
                  | RuleID | W | C=b'1 | b'0-pad(opt) |
                  + ------ + - + ----- + ------------ +


     Figure 1: SCHC Success ACK message format, as defined in RFC8724

   In case SCHC fragment losses are found in any of the windows of the
   SCHC Packet (C=0), the SCHC Compound ACK MAY be used.  The SCHC
   Compound ACK message format is shown in Figure 2.

   The window numbered 00, if present in the SCHC Compound ACK, MUST be
   placed between the Rule ID and the C bit to avoid confusion with
   padding bits.  If padding is needed for the SCHC Compound ACK,
   padding bits MUST be 0 to make subsequent window numbers and bitmaps
   distinguishable.


     |-SCHC ACK Header--| W = x  |...|    W = x + i     |
     +------------------+ ------ +...+ ------- + ------ +------------+
     |RuleID|W=b'x|C=b'0| Bitmap |...| W=b'x+i | Bitmap |b'0-pad(opt)|
     +------+-----+-----+ ------ +...+ ------- + ------ +------------+

                    Losses are found in windows W = x,...,x+i


                Figure 2: SCHC Compound ACK message format

   Each different SCHC LPWAN technology profile MUST specify how the
   SCHC Compound ACK is different from the Receiver-Abort message.

   The SCHC Compound ACK MAY use a Compressed Bitmap, and bitmap fields
   MAY be of variable size.

3.2.  SCHC Compound ACK Examples

   Figure 3 shows an example transmission of a SCHC Packet in ACK-on-
   Error mode using the SCHC Compound ACK.  In the example, the SCHC
   Packet is fragmented in 14 tiles, with N=3, WINDOW_SIZE=7, M=2 and
   two lost SCHC fragments.  Only 1 compound SCHC ACK is generated.

3.3.  SCHC Compound ACK YANG Data Model

   The present document also extends the YANG data model defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lpwan-schc-yang-data-model] by including a new leaf in the
   Ack-on-Error fragmentation mode to describe the option to use the
   SCHC Compound ACK, as well as its bitmap format.  Figure 5 shows this
   definition:

4.  Security considerations

   The current document specifies a message format extension for SCHC.
   Hence, the same Security Considerations defined in [RFC8724] apply.
