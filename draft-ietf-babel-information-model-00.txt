                        Babel Information Model
                 draft-ietf-babel-information-model-00

Abstract

   This Babel Information Model can be used to create data models under
   various data modeling regimes (e.g., YANG).  It allows a Babel
   implementation (via a management protocol such as netconf) to report
   on its current state and may allow some limited configuration of
   protocol constants.

1.  Introduction

   Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol defined in
   RFC 6126 [RFC6126] and draft-ietf-babel-rfc6126bis
   [babel-rfc6126bis].  Babel Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
   Cryptographic Authentication, defined in RFC 7298 [RFC7298],
   describes a cryptographic authentication mechanism for the Babel
   routing protocol.  This document describes an information model for
   Babel (including HMAC) that can be used to created management
   protocol data models (such as a netconf [RFC6241] YANG data model).
   Other Babel extensions may be included in this document when they
   become working group drafts.

   Due to the simplicity of the Babel protocol and the fact that it is
   designed to be used in non-professionally administered environments
   (such as home networks), most of the information model is focused on
   reporting status of the Babel protocol, and very little of that is
   considered mandatory to implement (conditional on a management
   protocol with Babel support being implemented).  Some parameters may
   be configurable; however, it is up to the Babel implementation
   whether to allow any of these to be configured within its
   implementation.  Where the implementation does not allow
   configuration of these parameters, it may still choose to expose them
   as read-only.

Internet-Draft           Babel Information Model               July 2017


1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Notation

   This document uses a programming language-like notation to define the
   properties of the objects of the information model.  An optional
   property is enclosed by square brackets, [ ], and a list property is
   indicated by two numbers in angle brackets, <m..n>, where m indicates
   the minimal number of values, and n is the maximum.  The symbol * for
   n means no upper bound.

3.  Acknowledgements

   This information model was originally derived from RFC 6126
   [RFC6126].  That model is being modified according to draft-ietf-
   babel-rfc6126bis [babel-rfc6126bis].  Juliusz Chroboczek review has
   been very helpful in refing this information model.

Appendix A.  Open Issues

   This draft must be reviewed against draft-ietf-babel-rfc6126bis.

   Following are some issues where a conscious decision may be useful:

      babel-self-router-id: Should this be an opaque 64-bit value
      instead of int?

      Would it be useful to define any of the following as per-interface
      constants: hello-interval-lossy, hello-interval-lossless, ihu-
      interval, update-interval, ihu-hold-time, route-expiry-time,
      garbage-collection-time, max-trigger-delay, max-normal-delay, ack-
      limit, resend-trigger-lossy-limit, resend-trigger-lossless-limit,
      resend-normal-lossy-limit, resend-normal-lossless-limit

      babel-interfaces-obj: "This needs further discussion, I fear some
      of these are implementation details."

      Would it be useful to define some parameters for reporting
      statistics or logs?

      Would it be useful to define some parameters specifically for
      security anomalies?
