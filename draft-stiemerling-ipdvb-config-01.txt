Internet-Draft         IPDVB Address Configuration             June 2005


1.  Introduction

   Future IPDVB networks will require a more powerful IP address
   configuration management as it is currently provided in such
   networks.  Current discussions within the IPDVB working group have
   shown that the future usage scenarios and requirements for dynamic
   configuration of IP addresses are not yet clear defined.  This memo
   identifies the problem space, sketches possible future scenarios, and
   gives an outlook into related areas.  The IP address mapping to Layer
   2 identifier, known as IP address resolution, and the reverse way are
   out of scope of this memo.  This topic is discussed in [5].

   The IPDVB working group has defined a new encapsulation scheme to
   transport IP over DVB (MPEG2 based) networks, the so-called Ultra-
   lightweight Encapsulation [1].  This protocol assumes that IP
   addresses have been already assignment to hosts, DVB receivers, and
   that hosts are already aware about other networking related
   parameters, such as IP gateway, DNS server, etc.  Whereas today IP
   addresses are statically to those receivers, future deployments may
   require a more flexible IP address assignment as known from today's
   LAN, for instance, via DHCP [3] [4].  Assigning IP addresses
   dynamically opens the space for further auto-configuration of DVB
   receivers. information.

   This memo is a problem statement only and is intended to start
   discussions within the IPDVB working group on how IP addresses and
   additional related information can be dynamically configured.
   Comments and discussions should be sent to the IPDVB's mailing list
   at ipdvb@erg.abdn.ac.uk.  The working group charter is available
   here: http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ipdvb-charter.html.

   Section 2 introduces the network configuration for IPDVB networks.
   Section 3 describe two scenarios in detail.  The document concludes
   with Section 4 listing similar areas of interest.

   The terminology used throughout this memo is defined in [2]

2.  Network Configuration Scenarios

   The basic assumption for IPDVB networks with respect to IP address
   configuration is the number of possible receivers (hosts) within a
   single IP subnetwork.  It is assumed that future IPDVB networks may
   extend to 1*10E5 receivers per subnetwork but also may be limited to
   10 or less receivers per subnetwork.  This possible number of hosts
   should be consider when describing scenarios and later the solution.
   However, the remainder of this section discusses different network
   scenarios with respect to their topology in the Internet and DVB
   network.  Figure 1 sketches a typical configuration of DVB receivers
   with an additional uplink, separated from DVB.  This uplink can be,
   but is not limited to, ISDN, DSL, or cellular networks based.

                  Figure 1: Basic configuration scenario

   The network provider is connected to the DVB network and IP network.
   Data from the IP network towards the DVB receiver is transmitted
   either over the DVB uplink or the uplink connecting them directly.
   Data transmitted via the DVB uplink is transported of the DVB network
   and broadcasted to the DVB receivers.  The uplink connecting network
   provider and DVB receiver can be unidirectional.  The scenario
   depicted in this figure is well-known for DVB-S based high speed
   Internet access with modem or ISDN uplink.  This type of installation
   is used to replace or substitute DSL deployments in geographical
   areas where DSL cannot be provided, for instance.

   Figure 2 shows a scenario where the DVB receiver is connected via a
   DVB link only and this link is used in a bidirectional way.  Such a

   configuration will be used, for instance, on ships while being at sea
   and DVB-S is available only.  In this configuration all information,
   including IP addresses, must be transmitted via the DVB link.

                 Figure 2: DVB only configuration scenario

   A scenario similar to a today's common usage is the DVB broadcast as
   it is shown in  Figure 3.  The DVB part is an unicast link and all
   data is broadcasted to all receivers.  This configuration is mainly
   used today for TV broadcasts (based on MPEG-2) but can be used to
   broadcast IP data to the DVB receivers too.  In such case, DVB
   receivers do not have the ability to interact with any other entity
   to be configured.  Address information can be delivered from a
   network provider to the receivers by a push mechanism only.  However,
   a fine-grained IP address configuration per receiver seems to be out
   of scope in this case, since configuration of broadcast or multicast
   groups is appropriate only.

3.  Scenarios

3.1  IP configuration available

   This section considers scenarios where DVB receivers have IP
   addresses already configured, or can obtain these through another way
   such as the ISDN uplink in Figure 1, and only configuration of
   additional information is required.  This address configuration of
   DVB receivers, for example, may be either pre-configured by the
   service provider or be configured by users.  Figure 1 shows such a
   configuration example.  The DVB receiver will obtain its basic IP
   address configuration via the non-DVB uplink (most likely via ISDN
   and PPP).  This scenario requires  additional configuration to be
   loaded at the DVB receivers.  Possible things to configure:

   o  IP service information, such as DNS server, proxies, etc

   o  multicast configuration and routing information

   o  broadcast configuration ("open bitstream" without any
      registration, DVB receivers just receive IP streams)

   o  security configuration, e.g., keys, policies.


3.2  Complete Bootstrap

   Future scenarios can require a complete bootstrap of DVB receivers
   without any pre-configuration available on the IP level.  Those DVB
   receivers may be pre-configured to known a basic DVB configuration,
   such as PID assignment for system information tables (SI tables).
   Such a receiver would need to retrieve first an IP address and learn
   about its IP environment (netmask, IP next hop, ...).  Figure 2 shows
   such a scenario where a DVB receiver (and transmitter) is installed
   aboard a ship and is a gateway between the ship's network and the DVB
   network.  The complete bootstrap scenario includes the one shown in
   Figure 3 too.

Internet-Draft         IPDVB Address Configuration             June 2005


4.  Related Work

   Configuration of DVB, or more general MPEG2 based, networks is
   tackled in several other environments with different prerequisites.
   The IP over Cable Data Networks (IPDCN) working group is working in
   this area and is specifying several MIB modules with respect to MPEG2
   network configuration.  DVB itself has defined several mechanism to
   configure receivers, such as system information tables (SI tables),
   or within MHP.

   Configuration of IP hosts is focus of the Network Configuration
   (NETCONF) working group,  Dynamic Host Configuration (DHC) working
   group, and defined in several RFC documents (IPV6 neighbor discovery,
   IPv4 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)).

5.  Conclusions

   This memo is first attempt to solve the questions on how future IPDVB
   networks can deal with dynamic IP address configuration.  Open
   questions are:

   o  What are the configuration scenarios?

   o  What exactly should be configured?

   o  How to configure?

   o  Who is in control of the receiver?  The operator is in control of
      the receiver in the case of MHP.  Users running a DVB PC adaptor
      have full control over their receiver and network operators
      running their routers on DVB network a likely not to give away
      control over their equipment.

   o  Is it right to assume that the network provider and DVB network
      operator are the same entity.

   During the first discussions at the 61st IETF some differences
   between IPDVB and other network configuration techniques have been
   noted.  The NETCONF approach is made for single router configuration
   and is not intended to configure thousands of host at the same time.
   IPCDN on the other hand considers 1*10e3 hosts per cable head end to
   be configured.  IPDVB must consider up to 1*10e5 hosts per segment,
   see Section 2.  This must be definitely taken into account when
   designing a solution.

   This memo is neither accurate nor complete at this point of time and
   should trigger the discussions within the IPDVB working group.
   Feedback about this memo is welcome.
