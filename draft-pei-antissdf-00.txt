Abstract

   In cognitive sensor networks, the cooperative spectrum sensing can
   effectively improve the accuracy of spectrum sensing. However, it is
   also facing with the security issues caused by attacks of potential
   malicious  users.  Lots  of  algorithms  are  proposed  in  existing
   literatures  to  cope  with  the  potential  attacks.  However,  the
   traditional strategies are mainly suitable for relative simple and
   ideal attack such as the all "1" or all "0" attack. Therefore, we
   define a more universal anti Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification
   (SSDF) framework in the document, which can better cope with the
   probabilistic attacks and random attacks which are closer to the
   reality.

1. Introduction

   Spectrum sensing is the basis and prerequisite of cognitive sensor
   networks. However, due to the shadow effect and multipath fading of
   the signal as well as the limitation of the calculation performance
   of single cognitive sensor node (or user), there exist big errors in
   the result of the spectrum sensing. The cooperative spectrum sensing
   among multiple cognitive sensor nodes is thus proposed to enhance
   the spectrum sensing performance of single cognitive sensor node.
   More specifically, multiple cognitive sensor nodes detect the
   spectrum simultaneously, one of which is responsible for fusing all
   detected data and making the final decision. As a key technology of
   cognitive radio, cooperative spectrum sensing not only has excellent
   sensing performance, but also can reduce the sensitivity

   requirements of detection hardware and further reduce deployment
   cost of the cognitive sensor networks.

   However, there are serious security issues in the cooperative
   spectrum sensing while the accuracy of spectrum sensing can be
   improved effectively. In the cooperative spectrum sensing, some
   malicious nodes (users) among the cognitive sensor nodes (users) may
   deliberately influence the spectrum sensing process through forgery,
   deception, flooding and gang cooperation, which makes the fusion
   center get the wrong sensing information. Based on the wrong sensing
   information, the fusion center may make wrong final decision, and
   further obtain wrong detection result. Thus the cognitive sensor
   nodes (users) cannot faithfully perform spectrum switching according
   to the external environment, and the channel allocation will be
   controlled and used by the attacker. This kind of attack method,
   which interferes with the normal operation of the data fusion center
   by sending the fake sensing data to the fusion center, is referred
   to as Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification (SSDF) attack.

   As a considerably important topic in cognitive sensor networks, the
   security issues have received increasing attention. Among them, the
   SSDF attack is a major security threat in cognitive radio networks.
   Currently, the anti SSDF algorithm is mainly divided into two steps:
   the first step is to detect malicious users, and the second step is
   to how to process the malicious data in the fusion center.

   In the detection of malicious users, some literatures proposed to
   detect malicious users by comparing the local judgment results with
   the final results in the fusion center. It is assumed in this kind
   of detection method that the malicious users are sending the wrong
   data. The implementation is thus relatively simple. But in reality,
   malicious users may only send the wrong data with a certain
   probability, thus the proposed algorithms cannot effectively cope
   with the SSDF attack. Other literatures proposed to detect malicious
   users through estimating the deviation value of the sensing data
   from their mean value. But in the scenarios with more malicious
   users, a more robust estimation method of the mean value is urgently
   needed.

   In the processing of malicious data, there are generally three
   processing methods of malicious data according to the existing
   literatures. The first method is to delete the malicious data
   directly. The method is the simplest. Obviously, the final judgment
   of the sensing result can be greatly affected due to the lack of the
   deleted malicious data. The second is to remove the malicious data,
   and then use the mean value of the entire dataset to replace it.
   Although the method is better than the first, the differences of

   different sensing data is erased as well, which can still affect the
   final judgment of sensing results. The third is to give different
   weight to different sensing results of multiple cognitive sensor
   nodes (users) according to certain an algorithm to neutralize
   malicious data. If the local judgment results of a cognitive user
   are consistent with the final results, more trust/weight is given,
   and vice versa. By employing the method, the attacks of malicious
   users can be effectively inhibited. However, in some special
   occasions, more complex attack modes might be used by malicious
   users to deceive the detection mechanism. For example, a malicious
   user deliberately operates as a normal user within some time, and
   then starts to attack the system after acquiring enough trust of the
   fusion center. The attackers can initiate an SSDF attack in a pre-
   designed attack mode with a quite high trust degree. Therefore, the
   attacks of malicious users are hard to be inhibited effectively by
   means of the user's entire historical performance or simply the
   accumulated reputation value. Furthermore, the weighted algorithm is
   not fair for the normal users because part of the sensing data of
   malicious users is still remained in the final fusion process.
   Additionally, the weighted malicious data is not necessarily the
   normal and effective data. In the case, the malicious user still
   seriously affects the detection performance of the sensing system.
   Besides, in the case of malicious data seriously deviating from the
   mean value, the effect of the weight of sensing data is more fragile
   which can greatly affect the final judgment.

   Considering the insufficiency of traditional anti-SSDF strategies,
   we define an anti-SSDF framework with more universality in the
   document: the data reconstruction based anti-SSDF framework.

3. The data reconstruction based anti SSDF framework

3.1. The detection framework of malicious users

   In order to find malicious data, the mean value mu and variance
   sigma^2 of the dataset need to be calculated. Then the malicious
   data can be distinguished through its deviation degree. At present,
   the estimation algorithm is shown as the following formula:

   mu^=1/n*(sum(mu_i))

   sigma^2=1/n*(sum(mu_i-mu^)^2)

   This kind of estimation algorithm is simple and convenient. However,
   there are big errors in the estimation algorithm when there exist
   some malicious data, especially when malicious data is too much.
   Therefore, in order to detect malicious users more accurately in
   more universal cases, a kind of mean and variance value estimation
   algorithm with robustness is necessary.

   Based on this, the Orthogonalized Gnanadesikan Kettenring(OGK)
   algorithm is considered to be used in the document to estimate mu
   and sigma^2, which makes the estimation value more close to the
   actual value. OGK algorithm was firstly proposed by Maronna and
   Zamar in 2002. This kind of algorithm can provide a relative
   accurate estimated value when there exist part of malicious value.
   It has better robustness, stronger malicious data tolerance ability
   and lower algorithm complexity.

   The dataset of U={mu_1,mu_2,...,mu_n} is seen as a sample with
   single variable in OGK algorithm, and meets normal distribution with
   mu as mean value and sigma^2 as variance. Mu and sigma^2 are
   calculated according to the following formula:

   Mu^=sum(mu_i*W(v_i))/sum(W(v_i)),v_i=(mu_i-mu_0)/sigma_0

   sigma^2=(sigma_0^2/n)*sum rho((mu_i-mu^)/sigma_0)

   Where the weighted function W(x) and rho(x) function can be
   described as, respectively,

   W(x)=(1-(x/c_1)^2)^2, (|x|<=c_1)

   Rho(x)=min(x^2,c_2^2)

   Where c_1 and c_2 are turning coefficient, which can be determined
   according to actual situations. Mu_0 and sigma_0 are median and
   absolute median deviation in dataset U, respectively.

   The dataset U={mu_1,mu_2,,mu_n} can be standardized into
   Y={y_1,y_2,...,y_n}, where y_1=|mu_1-mu^/sigma^|,...,y_n=|mu_n-
   mu^/sigma^|.

   Let V_i=y_i(i=1,...,n) denote the residual error. When the residual
   error of a data meets V_i>3*sigma (sigma is the standard error that
   can be obtained from the calculation based on the Bessel formulas),
   the data will be considered as malicious data (the corresponding
   user is a malicious user).

3.2. The processing framework of malicious users

   The k-means clustering algorithm in data mining is adopted in the
   document to process malicious data. In 1976, the K-means clustering
   algorithm was proposed by Macqueen (J.B.Macqueen) to process data
   clustering problem. This kind of clustering algorithm is widely
   applied because it's simple and convenient. It also has high
   scalability, good reliability and high efficiency. Therefore, it is
   often applied in science and industry areas.

   The processing flow of K-means clustering algorithm is shown as
   below:

   Input: dataset X={x_1,x_2,...,x_n}, cluster number k,

   Output: k class clusters C_j,j=1,2,...,k.

   [step1] Let I=1, randomly select k data points as initial cluster
   centers of k class clusters, m_j(I), j=1,2,...,k;

   [step2] Calculate the Euclidean distance of each data point to the k
   class clusters, d(x_i,m_j(I)), i=1,...,n ,j=1,...,k. If satisfied
   d(x_i,m_j(I))=squr((x_i-m_j(I))^2)=min{ d(x_i,m_j(I))}, then x_i_is
   part of C_J;

   [step3] Calculate k new cluster centers: m_j(I+1)=(1/N_j)*sum(x_i),
   x_i is part of C_j, j=1,...,k;

   [step4] Judge: if m_j(I+1)is not equal to m_j(I), j=1,...,k, then
   I=I+1, return to step2, otherwise, the calculation finishes.

Internet-Draft           Anti-SSDF framework             December 2017


   After the clustering grouping of normal data is completed, the data
   is divided into k clusters and each cluster has a cluster center
   m_j(I), j=1,2,...,k. According to the relativity of cognitive user
   data with geographic position, the malicious users can be
   categorized into their nearest cluster (denoted by C_jM) to their
   self, and then the malicious data can be replaced with the cluster
   center value m_jM(I) of the cluster C_jM.

   After completing the above data replacement, the final fusion value
   can be calculated as follows:

   T=(mu_1+,...,+mu_(n-M))+(m_1(I)+...+m_M(I))

   The final judgment of the cooperative spectrum sensing can be made
   as follows

   If T is more than eta, then the detected channel is occupied;

   If T is less than eta, then the detected channel is idle.

   Where T represents the final fusion value, n represents the number
   of cognitive users, M represents the number of malicious users among
   the cognitive users, mu_i represents sensing data sent to the fusion
   center by normal cognitive users, m_h(I),h=1,...,M represents the
   latest sensing data of malicious users after data reconstruction(ie.
   cluster center value of the nearest cluster to their self), eta
   represents the judgment threshold of the fusion center.

4. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [RFC2234].

5. Security Considerations

   The document introduces a new anti SSDF framework for the cognitive
   sensor networks. The framework does not inherently introduce any
   additional threats.

6. IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
