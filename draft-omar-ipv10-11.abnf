MAC ==> The sending host MAC address.

Step-1 ==> PC-1 needs to communicate with PC-2, it sends a query to the
           DNS server (with either IPv4 or IPv6 address) to resolve
           the hostname PC-2.

Step-2 ==> The DNS server has a AAAA record for PC-2, and reply with
           PC-2's IPv6 address.

Step-3 ==> PC-1 can now communicate with PC-2 using IPv10 packets.
