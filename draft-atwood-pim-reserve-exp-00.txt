Abstract

   This memo asks the IANA to allocate experimental code points to the
   PIM Join Attribute Types register and the Encoded-Source Address
   Encoding Type Field register.

1.  Introduction

   To make it possible to experiment with protocol extensions safely,
   [RFC3692] recommends that "protocol documents should consider
   reserving a small set of protocol numbers for experimentation."

   Two IANA registries related to Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
   do not reserve any numbers for experimentation.

   This document requests the IANA to reserve two numbers for the
   Registry "PIM Join Attribute Types" and four numbers for the
   "Encoded-Source Address Encoding Type Field".

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Background

   In the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Parameters [URL] Protocol
   Registry, two sub-registries have no allocation for either Private or
   Experimental use.  They are "Encoded-Source Address Encoding Type
   Field", for which the current definitions are given in [RFC4601] and
   [RFC5384], and "PIM Join Attribute Types", for which the current
   definitions are given in [RFC5384].

   For the Encoded-Source Address Encoding Type Field, two values area
   assigned, and the remainder (2-255) are unassigned.

   For the PIM Join Attribute Types, four values are assigned, and the
   remainder (4-63) are unassigned.

   The remaining sub-registries all have values assigned for Private
   Use, for Experimental Use, or for extension of the type space.

   The registrations proposed in this document are of type Experimental
   [RFC5226], because the expected usage of these reservations would not
   likely be confined to a single site.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document only assigns values in two IANA registries.  The
   security implications of the use of these values must be considered
   by those who make use of them.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The requests in this document are for two registries that are part of
   the "Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Parameters" Registry.

   This document requests the IANA to reserve four values in the
   "Encoded-Source Address Encoding Type Field" registry:

    Type          Name                      Reference
    ----          ----                      ---------
    251-255       Reserved (Experimental)   [RFC4601][RFC5384][this doc]

   This document requests the IANA to reserve two values in the "PIM
   Join Attribute Types" registry:

    Type          Name                      Reference
    ----          ----                      ---------
    64-65         Reserved (Experimental)   [RFC5384][this doc]

5.  Acknowledgements

   Adrian Farrel and Brian Haberman observed that there were no
   reservations for Experimental Use for the PIM Join Attribute Type.
