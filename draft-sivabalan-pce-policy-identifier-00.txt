 Conveying policies associated with traffic engineering paths over PCEP

Abstract

   This document describes a simple extension to the Path Computation
   Element (PCE) Communication Protocol (PCEP) using which a PCEP
   speaker can enforce one or more policies on the other PCEP speaker.
   A policy is represented by a numeric value which can be interpreted
   only by the receiving PCEP speaker.  Using the proposed extension, a
   path computation client (PCC) can signal one or more policies that
   must be taken into consideration by a PCE during path computation.
   Similarly, when initiating or updating a path, a stateful PCE can
   signal one or more policies (e.g., traffic steering rules) that a PCC
   is expected to apply to the path.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) for
   communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a PCE or
   between a pair of PCEs.  [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] specifies
   extension to PCEP that allows a PCC to delegate its LSPs to a PCE.
   The PCE can then update the state of LSPs delegated to it.
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp] specifies a mechanism allowing a PCE
   to dynamically instantiate, maintain, and tear down Label Switched
   Paths (LSPs) without the need for configuring those LSPs on the PCC.
   Currently, the LSPs can either be signaled via RSVP-TE or can be
   segment routed as specified in [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing].

   As described in the next section, a PCEP speaker may want to
   influence its PCEP counterpart with respect to path selection and
   other policies.  This document describes a PCEP extension to signal
   policy identifier represented by numeric value using OPTIONAL PCEP

   TLV.  The specification is applicable to both stateful and stateless
   PCEP sessions.

2.  Motivation

   Paths computed using PCEP are subject to various policies on both PCE
   as well as PCC.  For example, in a centralized traffic engineering
   scenario, network operators may instantiate LSPs and specifies
   policies for traffic steering, path monitoring, etc., for those LSPs
   via stateful PCE.  Similarly, a PCC can request a path that is
   diverse from any other path originating from other PCC(s) from a
   stateful PCE.  With a current state of PCEP, introducing such policy
   requires new PCEP extension.  A generic mechanism that allows a PCEP
   speaker to specify the path policies without the need to know the
   details of such policies simplifies network operations, avoids
   frequent software upgrades, as well provides an ability to introduce
   new policy faster.

3.  Terminology

   The following terminologies are used in this document:

   LSP:  Label Switched Path.

   PCC:  Path Computation Client.

   PCE:  Path Computation Element

   PCEP:  Path Computation Element Protocol.

   TLV:  Type, Length, and Value.

4.  Policy Identifier TLV

   The new optional TLV is called "POLICY-ID-TLV" whose format is shown
   in the diagram below is defined to indicate the policies applied to a
   path.  This TLV is associated with the RP or SRP objects specified
   in[RFC5440] and [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] respectively.  The type
   of this TLV is to be allocated by IANA.

       0                   1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                     Figure 2: Format of POLICY-ID-TLV

   The TLV is formatted according to the rules specified in [RFC5440].
   The body of the POLICY-ID-TLV contains one 1-Octet flags and 3-Octet
   policy identifier.  By default, a policy is OPTIONAL.  If the M-flag
   is set, the policy is considered MANDATORY.  This TLV can optionally
   carry vendor-specific information via VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV whose
   format and processing rules are specified in [RFC7470].  The presence
   of VENDOR-INFORMATION-TLV is detected based on the TLV length, and
   the content and processing rule of vendor-specific information is
   outside the scope of this specification.

5.  Operation

   A single message MAY contain more than one POLICY-ID-TLVs.  In case,
   a a speaker receives a message containing multiple POLICY-ID-TLVs
   with the same policy ID, it MUST ignore all except for the first one
   itencounters in the message.  If a PCEP speaker does not recognize
   the TLV, it MUST ignore the TLV in accordance with ([RFC5440]).  If a
   PCEP speaker recognizes the TLV but does not support a mandatory
   policy included in the message, it MUST ignore the whole message and
   send PCErr with Error-Type = 2 (Capability not supported) as well
   include the POLICY-ID-TLV corresponding to the unsupported policies.

   When requesting a path from a PCE using a PCReq message ([RFC5440]),
   a PCC MAY include the POLICY-ID-TLV in the RP object.  The PCE MUST
   take into account all the policies included in the PCReq otherwise it
   MUST ignore the whole message and send PCErr message as mentioned
   above.

   In the case of stateful PCE, POLICY-ID-TLV MAY be included in PCReq,
   PCRpt, PCUpd, and PCInitiate messages as well.  When including
   POLICY-ID-TLV in PCRpt message, the SRP object MUST be present even
   in cases when the SRP-ID-number is the reserved value of 0x00000000.

6.  Security Considerations

   No additional security measure is required.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a new code point in the PCEP TLV Type
   Indicators registry, as follows:

                Value    Description           Reference

                 TBD     POLICY-ID-TLV         This document
