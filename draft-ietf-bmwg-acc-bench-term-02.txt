INTERNET-DRAFT Terminology for Accelerated Stress Benchmarking  February 2004

   1. Introduction

   Routers in an operational network are simultaneously configured with 
   multiple protocols and security policies while forwarding traffic and 
   being managed.  To accurately benchmark a router for deployment it is 
   necessary to test that router in operational conditions by 
   simultaneously configuring and scaling network protocols and security 
   policies, forwarding traffic, and managing the device.  It is helpful 
   to accelerate these network operational conditions so that the 
   router under test can be benchmarked with faster test duration.  
   Testing a router in accelerated network conditions is known as 
   Accelerated Stress Testing.  

   This document provides the Terminology for performing Stress 
   Benchmarking of networking devices.  The three phases of the Stress 
   Test: Startup, Instability and Recovery are defined along with the
   benchmark and configuration terms associated with the each phase.
   Benchmarks for stress testing are defined using the Aggregate 
   Forwarding Rate and control plane Session Count during each phase 
   of the test.  Also defined are the Benchmark Planes fundamental to 
   stress testing configuration, setup and measurement.  These are 
   the Control Plane, Data Plane, Management Plane and Security Plane  
   For each plane, the Configuration Set, Startup Conditions, and 
   Instability Conditions are defined.  White Box benchmarks are 
   provided in Appendix 1 for additional DUT behavior measurements.
   The terminology is to be used with the companion framework 
   document [6] and methodology document [7].
 
   2.  Existing definitions

   RFC 1242 "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect 
   Devices" and RFC 2285 "Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching 
   Devices" should be consulted before attempting to make use of this 
   document.

   For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts the template
   for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.  Definitions are
   indexed and grouped together in sections for ease of reference.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

   3.3 Startup

   3.3.1 Startup Phase

     Definition
	The portion of the benchmarking test in which the
	Startup Conditions are generated with the DUT.  This 
	begins with the attempt to establish the first session 
	and ends when the last Control Plane session is 
	established.

     Discussion:
	The Startup Phase is the first Phase of the 
	benchmarking test preceding the Instability Phase 
	and Recovery Phase.  It is specified by the
	Configuration Sets and Startup Conditions for
	each Benchmark Plane.  The Startup Phase ends
	and Instability Phase may begin when the 
	Configuration Sets are achieved with the DUT.

     Measurement Units:
	None

     Issues:
	The 'last control plane session is established' may not 
	be a sufficient indicator that steady-state is achieved 
	and Instability Conditions can be applied to begin the 
	Instability Phase.

   3.3.2 Benchmarks

   3.3.2.1 Stable Aggregate Forwarding Rate

     Definition: 
	Average rate of traffic forwarded by the DUT during the 
	Startup Phase.

      Discussion:
	Stable Aggregate Forwarding Rate is the calculated
	average the Aggregate Forwarding Rates measured during 
	the Startup Phase.  It is recommended that the 
	Aggregate Forwarding Rate is measured at one-second 
	intervals until the Startup Phase ends.
 
      Measurement units:
	pps

      Issues:
	The act of the DUT establishing the Startup Conditions
	could influence the forwarding rate in certain 
	implementations so that this "baseline" for the 
	remainder of the test is lowered.  The alternative is
	to change the definition of Startup Aggregate 
	Forwarding Rate so that it measured during the Startup 
	Phase, but after Startup Conditions are achieved.  
	The disadvantage of this definition would be that it 
	loses measurement of any impact establishing Startup 
	Conditions would have on forwarding rate. When 
	comparing the Startup Aggregate Forwarding Rate benchmark 
	of two devices it is preferred to know the impact
	establishing Startup Conditions has on Forwarding Rate. 
	The definition was therefore selected so that Stable
	Aggregate Forwarding Rate is calculated from measurement 
	samples throughout the entire Startup Phase.

     Definition:
	Total number of control plane sessions/adjacencies
	established and maintained by the DUT prior to 
	Instability Conditions being initiated.

      Discussion:
	This measurement should be made after the Control
	Plane Startup Conditions are applied to the DUT.

	Control Plane Configuration Set is shown in Figure 2 and specifies 
	the Routing Protocols, Multicast, and MPLS configuration.  Specific 
	protocols can be enabled or disabled for a benchmark test.

	of the Accelerated Stress Benchmarking to establish conditions 
	for the remainder of the test.

      Discussion:
	Startup Conditions may cause stress on the DUT and produce 
	failure.  Startup Conditions for the Security Plane include
	session establishment rate, number of sessions established
	and number of policies learned, and number of user access 
	sessions opened.

   3.4.2.1 Unstable Aggregate Forwarding Rate

     Definition: 
	Rate of taffic forwarded by the DUT during the
	Instability Phase.

      Discussion:
	Unstable Aggregated Forwarding Rate is an instantaneous
	measurement of the Aggregate Forwarding Rate during the
	Instability Phase.  It is recommended that the 
	Unstable Aggregate Forwarding Rate is measured at 
	one-second intervals.
 
      Measurement units:
	pps

      Issues:
	None

      See Also:
   	Instability Conditions
	Aggregate Forwarding Rate

   3.4.2.2 Degraded Aggregate Forwarding Rate 

      Definition:
	The reduction in Aggregate Forwarding Rate during the
	Instability Phase.	

      Discussion:
	The Degraded Aggregate Forwarding Rate is calculated 
	for each measurement of the Unstable Aggregate
	Forwarding Rate.  The Degraded Aggregate Forwarding 
	Rate is calculated by subtracting each measurement 
	of the Unstable Aggregate Forwarding Rate from the 
	Stable Aggregate Forwarding Rate, such that

	Degraded Forwarding Rate = 
	Stable Aggregate Forwarding Rate - 
		Unstable Aggregate Forwarding Rate

	Ideally, the Degraded Aggregate Forwarding Rate is zero.

	session state with the DUT.  The test equipment
	is also to monitor for sessions lost with the
	DUT which the test equipment itself did not 
	intentionally bring down.

   3.5 Recovery

   3.5.1 Recovery Phase

     Definition:
	The portion of the benchmarking test in which the
	Startup Conditions are generated with the DUT, but 
	the Instability Conditions are no longer offered to 
	the DUT.

     Discussion:
	The Recovery Phase is the final Phase of the
	benchmarking test following the Startup Phase and
	Instability Phase. Startup Conditions must not be 
	Restarted.

	Recovered Aggregate Forwarding Rate is an instantaneous 
	measurement of the Aggregate Forwarding Rate during the 
	Recovery Phase.  It is recommended that the Recovered
	Aggregate Forwarding Rate is measured at one-second
	intervals.  Ideally, each measurement of the Recovered
	Aggregate Forwarding Rate equals the Stable Aggregate
	Forwarding Rate because the Instability Conditions
	do not exist in both the Startup and Recovery Phases.

   4. Security Considerations
        Documents of this type do not directly effect the security of
        the Internet or of corporate networks as long as benchmarking
        is not performed on devices or systems connected to operating
        networks.
