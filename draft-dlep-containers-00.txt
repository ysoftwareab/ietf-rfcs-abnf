                     Container Data Items for DLEP
                        draft-dlep-containers-00

Abstract

   Several DLEP extensions are being suggested that require the ability
   to group a set of DLEP Data Items into a logical set or bag.  This
   document species a generic method of defining such a bag of Data
   Items, in what this document defines as a Data Item Container.  This
   document also describes what an extension using Data Item Containers
   must specify in the extension specification.

1.  Introduction

   A DLEP Data Item Container defined by this document is a generic
   wrapper or container of DLEP Data Items, where the presence of the
   container around the Data Items implies a logical association between
   the Data Items in the Container.

   This document does not define a new DLEP extension, but does instead
   define a set of guidelines for DLEP extension authors.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  Container Data Item

   The Container Data Item allows a DLEP extension to parenthesize a set
   of DLEP Data Items, implying a logical assocaition between the Data
   Items in the container.

   The Container Data Item contains the following fields:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Data Item Type                | Length                        |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   :               DLEP Data Items (zero or more)                  :
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Internet-Draft        Container Data Items for DLEP            July 2017


   Data Item Type:  Defined by the extension.  Allocated from IANA "DLEP
      Data Item Values" registry.

   Length:  Sum of Lengths of contained DLEP Data Items, including
      header lengths, i.e. the total length of the Container Data Item

   DLEP Data Items:  0 or more DLEP Data Items, as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-manet-dlep].

2.1.  Specification of Conatiner Data Items

   When the use of a Container Data Item is defined in a DLEP extension
   specification, the specification MUST define which DLEP Data Items
   are valid within the Conatiner, and also the multiplicity of Data
   Items in the Container.

   Unless otherwise allowed by an individual DLEP extension
   specification, any Data Item not defined as allowed in the Container
   MUST NOT appear, and an implementation receiving such a Data Item
   MUST teminate the DLEP session, using the DLEP Status Code 'Invalid
   Data'.

3.  Security Considerations

   I'm not sure there are any.

4.  IANA Considerations

   None.
