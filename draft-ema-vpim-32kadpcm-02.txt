      Overview

      This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-type
      audio/32KADPCM for toll quality audio.  This audio encoding is
      defined by the ITU-T in Recommendation G.726.


    Internet Draft             32 kbit/s ADPCM           November 21, 1997



      1.  Abstract

      This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-type
      audio/32KADPCM for toll quality audio.  This audio encoding is
      defined by the ITU-T in Recommendation G.726.  This document refines
      an earlier sub-type registration in RFC 1911.


      2. ITU-T Definition

      Recommendation G.726 [G726] defines the characteristics that are
      recommended for the conversion of a 64 kbit/s A-law or m-law pulse
      code modulation (PCM) channel at 8000 samples/second to and from a
      40, 32, 24 or 16 kbit/s channel. The conversion is applied to the
      PCM bit stream using an adaptive differential pulse code modulation
      (ADPCM) transcoding technique.  This Recommendation obsoletes G.721
      which only defined the 32 kbit/s characteristics.

      Recommendation G.726 was prepared by Study Group 15 of the
      Telecommunications Standardization Sector of the International
      Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) and was approved under the ITU's
      Resolution No. 2 procedure on the 14 of December 1990.


      3. MIME Definition

      3.1 audio/32KADPCM

      CCITT Recommendation G.726 [G726] describes the algorithm
      recommended for conversion of a 64 kbit/s A-law or u-law PCM channel
      to and from a 32 kbit/s channel (this is the same algorithm as
      described in the deprecated G.721).  The conversion is applied to
      the PCM stream using an Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation
      (ADPCM) transcoding technique.

      The MIME sub-type audio/32KADPCM is defined to hold binary audio
      data encoded in 32 kbit/s ADPCM exactly as defined by ITU-T
      Recommendation G.726.  No header information shall be included as
      part of the audio data.  The content transfer encoding is typically
      either binary or base64.

      An additional consideration that this document defines for clarity
      is the choice of little endian ordering of the four bit code words.
      This default ordering is defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.420
      [X420] for the equivalent X.400 body part, but is also detailed
      below in the IANA Registration.

      3.2 VPIM Usage

      The audio/32KADPCM sub-type is a primary component of the VPIM
      specification [VPIM].  In this context, the Content-Description and
      Content-Disposition headers are used to succinctly describe the
      contents of the audio body.  As well, only the little endian bit
      ordering is valid.  Refer to the VPIM Specifcation for proper usage.


      4.  IANA Registration

           To: ietf-types@iana.org
           Subject: Registration of MIME media type audio/32KADPCM

           MIME media type name: audio

           MIME subtype name: 32KADPCM

           Required parameters: none

           Optional parameters: none

           Encoding considerations: Binary or Base-64 generally preferred

           Security considerations: none

           Interoperability considerations:

              The four bit code word ordering within a byte may differ
              between existing implementations of G.726 codecs.  Since
              this content only permits the little endian ordering, codecs
              that support the opposite ordering must reorder the code
              words before storing to or retrieving from this content
              type.


           Published specification: ITU-T G.726 with little endian
      ordering

           Applications which use this media type: primarily voice
      messaging

              The 4-bit code words of the G.726 encoding MUST be packed
              into octets/bytes as follows:  the first code word (A) is
              placed in the four least significant bits of the first
              octet, with the least significant bit (LSB) of the code word
              (A0) in the least significant bit of the octet;  the second
              code word (B) is placed in the four most significant bits of
              the first octet, with the most significant bit (MSB) of the
              code word (B3) in the most significant bit of the octet.
              Subsequent pairs of the code words shall be packed in the
              same way into successive octets, with the first code word of
              each pair placed in the least significant four bits of the
              octet.  It is preferred that the voice sample be extended
              with silence such that the encoded value comprises an even
              number of code words.  However, if the voice sample
              comprises an odd number of code words, then the last code
              word shall be discarded.
