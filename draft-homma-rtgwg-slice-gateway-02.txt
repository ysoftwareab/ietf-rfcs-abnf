                   draft-homma-rtgwg-slice-gateway-02

Abstract

   This document describes the roles and requirements for a slice
   gateway that is a function or function group for handling data plane
   traffic, such as connecting/disconnecting and compose/decompose
   network slice subnet instances and providing network slices from end
   to end.  The interworking between management and control elements at
   the management and control planes with the gateway function for
   controlling and orchestrating end-to-end network slices are also
   presented in this document.

1.  Introduction

   Network slicing is an approach to create separate virtual networks in
   support of service depending on several requirements on the same
   physical resources, and it enables networks to adapt to requirements,
   which is diverse more, inexpensively and flexibly.  The overview is
   introduced in [Slicing_Tutrial] and [NECOS].

   It's also expected to enhance usability of infrastructural networks
   for tenants and create new business opportunities.  For example, by
   using network slices lent from infrastructure operators, other
   industrial companies can provide communication services including
   ensurance of network transport without having physical
   infrastructure.

   From a business point of view, a slice includes a combination of all
   the relevant network resources, functions, and assets required to
   fulfill a specific business case or service, including OSS, BSS and
   DevOps processes.

   From the network infrastructure point of view, network slice requires
   the partitioning and assignment of a set of resources that can be
   used in an isolated, disjunctive or non- disjunctive manner for that
   slice.

   From the tenant point of view, network slice provides different
   capabilities, specifically in terms of their management and control
   capabilities, and how much of them the network service provider hands
   over to the slice tenant.  As such there are two kinds of slices: (A)
   Inner slices, understood as the partitions used for internal services
   of the provider, retaining full control and management of them.  (B)
   Outer slices, being those partitions hosting customer services,
   appearing to the customer as dedicated networks.

   Network slices are established with combination of various
   technologies, such as software defined network (SDN), network
   function virtualization (NFV), or traffic engineering, and managed/
   operated with automation technologies such as orchestrator.

   Assumed use cases of network slices include establishment of virtual
   networks whose qualities are guaranteed from end to end under the
   supervision of multi-domain orchestrators.  In such cases, a network
   slice subnet is created on each domain, such as access network and
   core network, and an end-to-end network slices is composed of
   connected subnets.

   Network slice subnets are built based on specifications of the
   underlay network, and thus the used technologies might vary.
   Therefore, a gateway function, which enables to connect subnets while
   adapting the differentiations and forward data packets to/from the
   appropriate next subnet, is required.

   This document describes the gateway function for network slicing,
   called slice gateway or SLG, and its role and requirements.  Note
   that defining a new data plane technology is not a goal of this
   draft.  In addition, this draft aims to specify management-related
   requirements for an SLG, which may be implemented using existing data
   plane technologies.

2.  Definition of Terms

   This section describes definitions and terminologies related to
   network slicing, especially gateway function and interconnection
   network slices established in each domain.  Other complementary
   definitions are described in [I-D.homma-slice-provision-models].

   Network Slicing:  Network slicing is a methodology to create separate
      logical networks in support of services, depending on several
      requirements, on the same physical resources.  This is possible by
      combinations of several network technologies.

   Network Slice (NS):  An NS is a logical separate network that
      provides specific network capabilities and characteristics.  It is

Internet-Draft       draft-homma-rtgwg-slice-gateway          March 2020


      composed of set of resources including virtual/physical forwarding
      functions, links, and network functions.  There are several types
      of NS depending on network types where the NS is deployed.
      Transport slice is one of them and the detailed definition is
      provided in [I-D.rokui-teas-transport-slice-definition].  (Note
      that 3GPP and other SDOs use definitions "Network Slice Instance/
      NSI" and "Network Slice Subnet Instance/NSSI", but they are
      expressed as NS in this document.)

   Network Slice Instance (NSI):  An NSI is a logical network instance
      composed with required infrastructure resources, including
      networking (WAN), computing (NFVI) resources, and some include
      additional network service functions such as firewall or load-
      balancer.  It is composed of one or more Network Slice Subnet
      Instances.  Note that, the word "instance" is not used in the
      definition of transport slice discussed in the NS-DT (Network
      Slice Design Team).

   Network Slice Subnet:  An NS subnet is a representation of a set of
      resources structuring a part of NSI within a single domain.
      Network slice subnet concept is proposed in [TS.28.530-3GPP].
      Note that, in the definition of transport slice discussed in the
      NS-DT, Network Slice and Network Slice Subnet are not
      distinguished, and all types of network slices in transport
      network are called transport slice.

   Network Slice Subnet Instance (NSSI):  An NSSI is a partial logical
      network instance represented as a network slice instance.  It is a
      minimal unit managed or provided as a network slice.  One or more
      NSSI structure an NSI or an E2E-NSI.

   End-to-End Network Slice Instance (E2E-NSI):  An E2E-NSI is an NS
      providing connectivity among end points.  An E2E-NS is used for
      emphasizing end to end connectivity provided by an NS.

   Network Slice as a Service (NSaaS):  An NSaaS is a service delivery
      model in which a third-party provider (e.g., vertical customer)
      hosts NSs and makes them available to customers.  In this model,
      there are mainly two roles: NS provider and NS tenant.

   Network Slice Provider (NS Provider):  An NS provider is a person or
      group that designs and instantiates one or more NSIs/NSSIs, and
      provides them to NS tenants.  In some cases, an NS provider is an
      infrastructure operator simultaneously.  This includes NSI, NSSI,
      and E2E-NSI providers.

   Network Slice Tenant (NS Tenant):  An NS tenant is a person or group
      that rents and occupies NSs from NS providers.

   Domain:  A domain is a group of a network and devices administrated
      as a unit with common rules and procedures.

   Administrative Domain:  An administrative domain is a group of
      networks and devices managed by an administrator.

   Resource:  A resource is element used to create virtual networks.
      There are several types of resources, i.e., connectivity,
      computing and storage.

   Network Function Virtualization (NFV):  NFV is the concept or
      technologies to provide dedicated network appliances as software.

   Software Defined Network (SDN):  SDN is the concept or technologies
      to separate network control plane from data plane, and control
      network devices dynamically and flexibly.

   Virtual Network:  A virtual network is a network running a number of
      virtual network functions.  The detailed definition is provided in
      [RFC8453].

   Virtual Network Function (VNF):  A virtual network function (VNF) is
      a network function whose functional software is decoupled from
      hardware.  One or more virtual machines running different software
      and processes on top of industry-standard high-volume servers,
      switches and storage, or cloud computing infrastructure, and
      capable of implementing network functions traditionally
      implemented via custom hardware appliances and middleboxes (e.g.,
      router, NAT, firewall, load balancer, etc.)

   Slice Gateway Function (SLG):  An SLG is a function or a group of
      functions to connect/disconnect NSSIs.  The roles are described in
      the following sections.

   Business Support System and Operation Support System (BSS/OSS):  BSS/
      OSS are systems to support service providing and operation of
      network devices.

   Orchestrator:  Orchestrator is an entity to operate network
      components automatically.  There are several types of
      orchestrators including NFV Orchestrator (NFVO) or service
      orchestrator defined by ETSI NFV and Open Source MANO (OSM)
      ([NFV-Architectural-Framework] and [OSM-White-Paper]).

   SLG Controller (SLG-Ctrl):  An SLG-Ctrl is an entity that controls
      SLGs.  An SLG-Ctrl is controlled by upper-level operation systems
      such as OSS/BSS or orchestrator.

3.  Motivations and Roles of SLG

   One of the main roles of SLG is the enablement of interworkings
   between data plane with management and control elements for
   controlling and orchestrating end-to-end slices.

   Use cases of network slices are discussed in several Standard
   Developing Organizations (SDOs).  Some examples are described in use
   cases document ([I-D.netslices-usecases]).

   In some proposed use cases, an NS is structured across multiple
   network domains.  The capability of NSSIs might be different because
   the components are domain-specific.  In particular, the
   differentiation in capability between different administrative
   domains is large.

   Moreover, several variations can be considered on NS provisioning in
   NSaaS (ref.  [I-D.homma-slice-provision-models]), and some cases need
   abstraction of underlay infrastructure to NS tenants.  SLG solution
   provides controllability of network functions for manipulation of NSs
   intensively, and it can be expected to emphasize the manageability of
   NSIs in such cases.

   For connecting some different NSSIs and providing a NS that
   guarantees the prescribed quality from end to end, SLGs are required
   to connect such NSSIs.  SLGs enable to provide E2E-NSIs independently
   of specifications of underlay networks by hiding the differentiations
   and connecting between NSSIs.  An overview of this concept is shown
   in Figure 1.  SLGs glue NSSIs established on each domain and provide
   an E2E-NSI.

                      Figure 2: NSSI selection of SLG

   Note that, this model has the assumption that transitions of data
   packets from one NSSI to another are executed at only SLGs.  Also, an
   SLG is not necessarily implemented as a single device or virtual
   machine (VM).

4.  Architecture of Network Slicing System

   NSs are composed of several (virtual) network functions and links,
   and the characteristics of each NS are based on the assumed service.
   Also, some of NSs are deployed across multiple administrative
   domains.  For deploying the appropriate NSs based on each service
   requirements, a management system, which enables to control network
   resources totally within a domain, and interaction between such
   management systems are required.

   An SLG is a network function, and SLGs are installed at edge of
   NSSIs.  NSs are dynamically created, deleted, and moved depending on
   requests from network operator or NS tenants.  Therefore, some SLGs
   would be required to be VNF for flexible deployment.

   This section describes overview of NS management system architecture
   (Section 4.1) .  It refers [NFV-Architectural-Framework] and
   [OSM-White-Paper] for management of whole of NS and VNFs, and
   [RFC8453] and [I-D.ejj-teas-ns-framework] for transport network/slice
   manipulation.

   The architecture overview of NS management system is shown in

             Figure 3: Overview of NS Management Architecture

   Orchestrators manage whole resources including network elements and
   compute resources (i.e., routing, bandwidth, network functions).  In
   this figure, the resources are managed by resource orchestrators
   installed in each domain, and the network service orchestrator
   operates resource orchestrators.  A resource orchestrator includes
   modules for handling each resource type, such as NFVO (ref.
   [OSM-White-Paper]) and Transport Slice Controller/TSC (ref.  [I-
   D.ejj-teas-ns-framework]).  These orchestrators have recursive
   structure, and a network service orchestrator sometimes control other
   network service orchestrators in other administrative domains.

   NSs are requested from NS tenants via BSS/OSS and the order to create
   an NS is given to orchestrators.  Orchestrators manipulate network
   elements and compute resouces via controllers.  When an NS across
   multiple administrative domains are requested, the network service

Internet-Draft       draft-homma-rtgwg-slice-gateway          March 2020


   orchestrator request orchestrators in other administrative domains to
   create NSSIs.

   SLGs are also controlled via orchestrators.  An SLG can be
   implemented in a network element, or may be hosted on a compute
   resource if it runs as a VNF.

5.  Requirements for SLG

   An SLG is basically a component in the data plane and has the roles
   of data packet processing.  Moreover, it is required to have
   functions for control/management processes such as connecting to
   underlay networks or managing NSs.

   Furthermore, an SLG might be required to support handling services
   provided on NSs in addition to controlling of NS because an SLG is an
   edge node on an E2E-NSI.

   In this section, we describe the requirements for an SLG in terms of
   the following aspects and their interworkings.

   1. Data plane for NSs as infrastructure

   2. Control/management plane for NSs as infrastructure

   3. Data plane for services on NSs

   4. Control/management plane for services on NSs

5.1.  Management of NS as Infrastructure

5.1.1.  Data Plane Aspect

5.1.1.1.  Identification/Classification

   SLGs at the edge of E2E-NSs MUST have the capability to identify and
   classify data packets, and assign them to the appropriate E2E-NS.
   This requirement varies depending on the location.

   Fixed Access:  An SLG MUST identify and classify data packet with
      access point, including CPE or WiFi-AP, or subscriber ID such as
      VLAN-ID.  Moreover, in some services, an SLG should identify and
      classify data packets based on user device or application used in
      the communication.

   Mobile Access:  An SLG MUST identify and classify data packet with
      subscriber-ID such as IMSI, radio-wave bandwidth, or identifier of
      tunnels.  Moreover, in some services, an SLG should identify and



Homma, et al.           Expires September 9, 2020              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft       draft-homma-rtgwg-slice-gateway          March 2020


      classify data packets based on application used in the
      communication or location of the user equipment (UE).

   Connection Point between NSSI:  An SLG MUST identify and classify
      data packet based on the tunnel-ID or virtual routing and
      forwarding (VRF) that received the packets.  If specific slice
      identifier such as a value mapped in the metadata field of the IP
      header is used; an SLG should identify and classify data packets
      with the ID.

5.1.1.2.  Transporting/Forwarding

   SLGs MUST provide functions for transport data packets depending on
   the specifications of the underlay networks.

   Encapsulation/Decapsulation/Tagging:  In network slicing, duplication
      of IP addresses of user packets between NSs MUST be accepted,
      thus, using techniques that enable separation of a network
      logically is preferred.  In short, some tunnel protocols or
      tagging approaches should be used as transport of NSs.  For this
      reason, SLG MUST support encapsulation or tagging of data packets
      based on the specification of the underlay network.  Also, SLG
      MUST support the packets' decapsulation or untagging.  Examples of
      tunnel protocols and tags that can be used for creating NSs on L2/
      L3 segments are described below.



      L2 Segment:  VLAN, MPLS, Segment Routing MPLS (SR-MPLS), PPPoE,
         etc.

      L3 Segment:  GRE, L2TP, GTP-U, VxLAN, IPv6 Segment Routing (SRv6),
         etc.

      VxLAN, SR-MPLS, and SRv6 are described in their specification
      documents ([RFC7348], [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-mpls], and
      [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header]).

   Translation of Encapsulation/Tagging Form:  SLG MUST support to
      translate tunnel header or tag of received packets to the
      appropriate tunnel header or tag when it forwards data packets to
      the next NSSI that has different transport capability.

   Distribution of Traffic:  Some NSs have multiple route between the
      same end points within the same NSSI because of traffic
      engineering, switching to a redundant path, or other reasons, and
      SLG MAY forward data packets with the appropriate route based on
      some trigger information.  An example of the overview of this

Internet-Draft       draft-homma-rtgwg-slice-gateway          March 2020


      requirement is shown in Figure 4.  In this figure, there are two
      routes, main and sub, between SLGs, and an SLG switches forwarding
      route depending on the network situation such as congestion
      occurrence on the current route.

5.1.1.3.  Isolation among NSs

   In NSaaS, isolation control is required for avoiding an NS being
   affect by other NSs.  Traffic engineering or QoS control is ones of
   the most fundamental approaches to prevent disturbances among NSs.

   Traffic Shaping/Policing:  An SLG MUST execute traffic shaping and
      policing at its egress and ingress ports to avoid an NS using
      excessive traffic bandwidth.

   Quality of service (QoS) Control:  If there is an order of priority
      between NSs on the same underlay infrastructure, an SLG should
      remark the appropriate QoS parameter of the outer-most header of
      each packet following the preconfigured setting and provide packet
      scheduling based on the QoS parameter for providing priority
      control.  The field that SLG refers may vary depending on the
      specification of the underlay network.  For example, COS value is
      remarked in L2 segments; on the other hand, DSCP value is remarked
      in L3 segments.  In mobility networks standardized by 3GPP, QoS
      class is managed by using QoS Class Identifier (QCI) or 5G QoS
      Identifier (5QI) conveyed in extention header of user plane
      protocol, and they mapped to DSCP
      ([I-D.henry-tsvwg-diffserv-to-qci]).

5.1.1.4.  Service Chaining as Infrastructural Mechanism(*Optional)

   If an SLG is composed of a combination of several components, a
   service chaining mechanism is required to make them work together and
   achieve SLG functionality.

   Moreover, some NSs may traverse NFVs such as firewalls or cache
   servers for providing value-added services to their users.  In such
   cases, SLG might be required to support service chaining mechanisms,
   such as handling of network service header (NSH) defined in
   [RFC8300].  If an NS includes the service chaining architecture
   defined in [RFC7665], some SLG would be required to support following
   functions; classifier(CF), service function forwarder (SFF), and
   inter boundary node(IBN).  (Details of CF, SFF and IBN are described
   in SFC documents; [RFC7665], [RFC8459].)

5.1.2.  Control/Management Planes Aspects

5.1.2.1.  Interfaces to Controllers or Operation Systems

   SLG MUST have interface to its controller or operation systems for
   set parameters related to the data plane functions described in
   Section 5.1.1.  In addition, an SLG at the edges of E2E-NSs MUST have
   interfaces to authentication servers.

5.1.2.2.  Address Resolution/Routing

   An SLG MUST support address resolution or routing mechanisms to
   connect to underlay network elements including routers or L2
   switches.

5.1.2.3.  Authentication Authorization Accounting (AAA)

   For preventing entry of irregular traffic to NSs, an SLG at the edge
   of E2E-NS MUST support AAA mechanism for incoming traffic.  Also,
   when an SLG connects to another SLG in other administrative domain,
   SLGs should have a mechanism to confirm that the connection is
   established with the regular processes.  For example, an SLG is
   required to support authentication of the opponent SLG with key
   information indicated from higher-level operation systems.

5.1.2.4.  Operation Administration and Maintenance(OAM)

   In management of NSs, OAM mechanisms for both underlay and overlay
   networks is required for SLGs.  For an underlay network, an SLG MUST
   have OAM functions to confirm connectivity to interconnect equipment.
   For an overlay network as an NS, an SLG MUST have OAM functions to
   confirm connectivity to the nodes on the same NS.

Internet-Draft       draft-homma-rtgwg-slice-gateway          March 2020


5.1.2.5.  Traffic Monitoring

   An SLG shall support monitoring of traffic amount and latency as a
   mechanism for checking whether each of the accomodated NSs is
   satisfying its SLO.  When an NS can't fulfill its SLO, the SLG MUST
   send a notification to any listening system.  A use case where the
   traffic monitoring of SLGs is used for such closed loop schem is
   introduced in [I-D.pedro-nmrg-intelligent-reasoning]

5.2.  Management of Services on NS (*Optional)

5.2.1.  Data Plane Aspect

5.2.1.1.  Identification/Classification

   In NSaaS, some NS tenants may need delivery of an individual service
   to each user, device, or application on the same NS.  For such
   service deliveries, an SLG might be required to identify and classify
   user traffic based on some information such as subscriber ID or
   payload of data packets.  Also, an SLG should be controllable from
   the NS tenant.

5.2.1.2.  QoS Control

   An NS accommodates several communication devices and SLGs might be
   required to have fair queueing mechanisms for maintaining service
   quality of each user.  Also, different types of service traffic that
   have different priorities might coexist on an NS.  For example, some
   NS providers might provide telephone and internet access services to
   their users with an NS.  In such cases, SLG might be required to
   provide QoS control mechanisms for enforcing priority control based
   on service priorities.

   These QoS controls are executed depending on the information of inner
   packets and are independent of isolation mechanisms as
   infrastructure.  An SLG might be required to have a hierarchical QoS
   control mechanism in case that both QoS controls for services over
   NSs and isolation between NSs are required.

5.2.1.3.  Steering/Service Chaining(Cooperation with VNFs)

   SLG might be required to support steering or service chaining
   function for conveying data packets to the appropriate network
   functions deployed on an NS based on the classification result and
   user's contract information.

Internet-Draft       draft-homma-rtgwg-slice-gateway          March 2020


5.2.2.  Control/Management Planes Aspects

5.2.2.1.  Interfaces to Service Management Systems

   An SLG might have interfaces to controllers for managing user
   policies on each NS.  Some controllers might be deployed on the same
   NS.  If some controllers are located at external networks, they might
   require SLGs to have APIs.

5.2.2.2.  Collection of Telemetry information

   In an NSaaS, collection of telemetry information of each NS might be
   required for understanding traffic usage.  Thus, an SLG might be
   required to support to collect and report telemetry information of
   connected NSs.

6.  Structure of SLG

   SLG is composed of data plan entities and controller.  SLG Data plane
   entity (SLG-D) has functions to manipulate NSSIs and to handle
   traffic on slices.  In some cases, an SLG-D is composed of several
   physical devices and/or virtual instances.  Function types supported
   by SLG-D are listed Section 5.  SLG controller (SLG-C) accomodates
   multiple SLG Data plane entities via its southbound interface, and
   sets configurations into each SLG-D.  SLG-C also has a northbound
   interface(NBI) and it provides accesses to two endpoints: higher
   operation systems such as orchestrator, and to external customers and
   tenants which own their NSSIs.  Then, functionality and
   controllability exposed to customers/tenants ashould be limited, and
   the access must be secure (i.e., authentication and admission control
   should be supported).  The overview of SLG structure is shown in
   Figure 5.

7.  Deployment of SLG

   This section describes considerations related with deployment of
   SLGs.

7.1.  Examples of Components Required to Maintain SLG Functions

   For providing E2E-NSIs on existing network infrastructures, some
   components located at boundaries of domains are required to have the
   same set of functionality as an SLG.  Examples of such components in
   each domain type are described below.

   Fixed Network:  CPE/HGW, Service Edge, Gateway Router, etc.

   Mobile Network:  User Equipment, Radio-AP, eNodeB, S/P-GW
      ([TS.36.300-3GPP]), etc.

   Data Center:  Gateway Router, L2 switch, ToR switch, Server, etc.

7.2.  SLG Types Depending on Locations on NS

   There are mainly three types of SLG for creating E2E-NSI across
   multiple administrative domains.  The requirements of each SLG type
   are listed in Appendix A.

7.2.1.  Edge SLG(E-SLG)

   E-SLG is located at an edge of an E2E-NSI, and supports
   identification, classification and authentication of user traffic in
   addition to fundamental SLG functions, such as transport and
   isolation.  Also, it might be required to have capabilities for
   services delivered on an NS.

7.2.2.  Inter-Subnet SLG(IS-SLG)

   IS-SLG is located between NSSIs within a single administrative domain
   and has only fundamental functions such as QoS control or tranlation
   of headers.

   This type of SLG enables to separate an NSI into some NSSIs.  It will
   provide modularities of NSSIs, and simplify the management of NSIs.
   However, it is not necessarily required if a common transport
   mechanism in all domains is used.

7.2.3.  Inter-Domain SLG(ID-SLG)

   ID-SLG is located between NSSIs established on different domains.  It
   supports authentication for connecting to the opponent SLG in
   addition to fundamental functions.

7.3.  Horizontal Connection

   The connection form of an SLG varies depending on which type it is.
   Examples of horizontal connection forms of each SLG type are
   described below.

   E-SLG:  An E-SLG accommodates several hosts and NSSIs.  This has a
      forwarding table of end hosts and insert their packets to the
      appropriate NSSI.  An overview of this connection is shown in
      Figure 6.

   IS-SLG:  An IS-SLG has the role of mediator between NSSIs and passes
      packets received from an NSSI to the next one.  If transport
      methods used in each domain are different, the IS-SLG translate
      packet form to the appropriate one.  An overview of this
      connection is shown in Figure 7.

7.4.  Vertical Connection

   There are two patterns of vertical connection of SLGs in the middle
   of E2E-NSs.  The first pattern is that the SLGs accommodate only a
   set of NSSIs, which are composition of the same E2E-NS.  In this
   pattern, such SLGs are not required to support NSSI selection,
   however, establishment of a new SLG is required when a new E2E-NS is
   created.  This might causes extra overheads because of deploying many
   SLGs.

   The other pattern is that such SLGs are acceptable to accommodate
   multiple NSSIs from each domain.  In this pattern, SLGs support NSSI
   selection.  On the other hand, this pattern can restrain the number
   of SLGs.  Also, it is easy to provide transit of data packets from an
   NSSI to another NSSI on the same domain.

   The overviews of these patterns are shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10.

8.  Interconnection between NSSIs

   SLG provides interconnectivity between NSSIs.  The concept and
   fundamental framework including the related NS information model are
   described in NSSIs interconnection document
   ([I-D.defoy-coms-subnet-interconnection]).

   This section is focused on interconnection between NSSIs established
   on different administrative domains, and describes considerations
   related to this condition.

8.1.  Pre-arrangement of transport protocols

   For interconnection between different administrative NSSIs, pre-
   arrangement of the transport protocol, which is used to connect
   between SLGs is required.  Orchestration systems indicate the
   protocol and configuration to each SLG.

8.2.  Quality Assurance between SLGs

   In addition to establishing connection, quality control of
   communication is important.  SLGs of egress side should execute
   traffic shaping to prevent some NSs from excessively occupying the
   link between SLGs.  Moreover, some SLGs are connected to several
   other SLGs that are deployed on the different locations.  Therefore
   SLGs of the ingress side should execute traffic policing to avoid
   excessive inflow of traffic into some NSs.  The parameters for these
   controls are pre-configured by orchestration systems.

   The above approaches are ones of the simplest ways to provide quality
   assurance of inter-administrative subnets.  If there is stricter
   isolation request, more considerations would be required.

8.3.  Secure Interconnection

   For connecting networks of different administrators, secure
   interconnection schemes are required.  Especially, in an NSaaS,
   networks might be connected to several networks, and schemes for
   ensuring secure connectivity would be more important.

   SLGs confirm whether the opponent SLG is regular when it requests to
   connect, and reject the request if the SLG is not regular.  In some
   cases, SLGs might be confirm whether the inner packets received from
   the other SLGs are sent from regular users.

9.  Interfaces of SLG Controller

9.1.  Southbound Interface

   SLG-C supports protocols to communicate with SLG-Ds.  Information and
   prameters exchanged between SLG-D and SLG-C are TBD.

9.2.  Northbound Interface for Higher Operation Systems

   TBD

9.3.  Northbound Interface for Customers/Tenants

   SLG-C can provide some capabilities, such as NS allocation and
   obtaining of NS status, for customers/tenants to handle their own
   NSs.  An example of data models for this interface is shown in
   Appendix B.

10.  Security Considerations

   Requirements and considerations for SLG related to security are
   described in Section 5 and Section 8.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

Appendix C.  Complementation of Network Slicing in 3GPP

   The 3GPP 5GS is natively support network slicing (ref.
   [TS.23.501-3GPP], and UPF provides some functions as SLG, such as NS
   selection, QoS control, traffic steering, etc. 3GPP is responsible
   for standardizing user plane manipulation for mobility management,
   and interworking with transport on underlay network and external
   networks of 5GS such as DNs is out of scope in 3GPP.

   SLG concept will provide complemental definitions of functions and
   interfaces for providing E2E-NSI including 5GS.  A way of
   interworking between transport slice and RAN/UPF is described in
   [I-D.rokui-5g-transport-slice].  In this case, RAN/UPF and transport
   slice endpoints connected to them behave as ID-SLGs.

   Another way for interworking is RAN/UPF support functionalities of
   SLG for transport slice.  However, this is not supported in 3GPP
   standards, and may inhibit multi-vendor implementation.
