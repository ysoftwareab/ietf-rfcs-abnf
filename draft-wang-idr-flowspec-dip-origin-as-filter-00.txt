1.  Introduction

   BGP Flow Specification (BGP-FS) [RFC5575] defines a new BGP NLRI to
   distribute traffic flow specification rules via BGP ([RFC4271]).
   BGP-FS policies have a match condition that may be n-tuple match in a
   policy, and an action that modifies the packet and forwards/drops the
   packet.  Via BGP, new filter rules can be sent to all BGP peers
   simultaneously without changing router configuration, and the BGP
   peer can install these routes in the forwarding table.  BGP-FS
   defines Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) format used to
   distribute traffic flow specification rules.  NLRI (AFI=1, SAFI=133)
   is for IPv4 unicast filtering.  NLRI (AFI=1, SAFI=134) is for BGP/
   MPLS VPN filtering.[I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn][I-D.ietf-idr-
   flowspec-l2vpn] extends the flow-spec rules for layer 2 Ethernet
   packets.

   This document specifies a new BGP-FS component type to support AS-
   level filtering.  The match field is the origin AS number of the
   destination IP address that is encoded in the Flowspec NLRI.

3.  The Flow Specification Encoding for Destination-Origin-AS Filter

   This document proposes a new flow specification rule that is encoded
   in the NLRI.  The following new component type is defined.

   o  Destination-IP-Origin-AS

   Type TBD1 - Destination-Origin-AS

   Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

   Contains a set of {operator, value} pairs that are used to match the
   Destination-IP-Origin-AS (i.e. the origin AS number of the
   destination IP address).

   The operator byte is encoded as:

       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     | e | a |  len  | 0 |lt |gt |eq |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+


   Where:

   e - end-of-list bit.  Set in the last {op, value} pair in the list.

   a - AND bit.  If unset, the previous term is logically ORed with the
   current one.  If set, the operation is a logical AND.  It MUST be
   unset in the Destination-Origin-AS filter.

   lt - less than comparison between data and value.

   gt - greater than comparison between data and value.

   eq - equality between data and value.

   The bits lt, gt, and eq can be combined to produce match the
   Destination-Origin-AS filter or a range of Destination-IP-Origin-AS
   filter(e.g. less than AS1 and greater than AS2).

   The value field is encoded as:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+
     ~       Destination-IP-Origin-AS  (4 octets)                    ~
     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

4.  Use Case

   In AS64597's R1, if the ISP AS64597 wants to redirect all packets
   from IP Prefix 61 to AS64598, first goto to R3, then forward to
   AS64598", the ISP can use the traditional method or the method
   defining in this draft.

     Figure 1: Steering the Traffic Using Flowspec

   Using the traditional method, the ISP AS64597 needs to setup multiple
   "Destination Prefix + Source Prefix" rules in Router R1 as following:

  Figure 2: Steering the Traffic Using Destination Prefix and Source Prefix


   Using the method defining in this draft, the ISP AS64597 needs to
   setup only one "Destination Origin AS + Source Prefix" rule in Router
   R1 as following:

     +--------------+--------------+-------------------------+
     | Destination  | Source Prefix| Redirect to IP Nexthop  |
     | IP Origin AS |              |                         |
     +--------------+--------------+-------------------------+
     |  64598       | IP Prefix 61 |       R3                |
     +--------------+--------------+-------------------------+
