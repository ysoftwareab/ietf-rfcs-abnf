1. Introduction

   An ever-increasing number of people are using the Internet and, many
   for the first time, are using the tools and utilities that at one
   time were only available on a limited number of computer systems (and
   only for really intense users!).  One sign of this growth in use has
   been the significant number of TCP/IP and Internet books, articles,
   courses, and even TV shows that have become available in the last
   year.

   Most of the popular literature, however, has been oriented towards
   the system administrator or network manager at a site, and even the
   "introductory topics" intimidate the first-time users.  Many sites,
   in fact, could use a basic guide that teaches their users how to
   access the common utilities found in today's TCP/IP packages for
   mainframes and personal computers alike.

   This ``INTERNET-DRAFT'' is a brief guide to some of the TCP/IP and
   Internet tools and utilities that allow users to access the wide
   variety of information on the network, from finding out if a
   particular host is up and running to a multimedia thesis on foreign
   policy.  This is meant as a brief guide for the end user and will
   refer to other sources for more detailed information.  It can act
   as a tutorial or laboratory manual for new users first using the
   Internet and TCP/IP tools and utilities.

   This ``INTERNET-DRAFT'' assumes that users will be using TCP/IP,
   but does not provide any detail nor motivation about the Internet
   Protocol Suite.  More information on TCP/IP and related issues may
   be found in [tt], [za], and [zb].


2. A Starter's Guide to Some of the Utilities and Applications

   This section provides detailed descriptions and examples of several
   TCP/IP utilities and applications.  These sections include actual
   sessions using these utilities (with some extraneous information
   removed).  Most of the sample dialogues shown below were made using
   the Multinet TCP/IP software for VAX/VMS systems.  While these
   examples can be used as a guide to using and learning about the
   capabilities of these tools, the reader should understand that not
   all applications may be found at all TCP/IP hosts nor in all
   commercial software packages.  Furthermore, the user interface for
   different packages will be different and the actual command line may
   appear differently than shown here; this will be particularly true
   for graphic user interfaces such as Windows, OS/2, or the Mac.  The
   Internet has many exciting things to offer but standardized
   interfaces to the protocols is not yet one of them!

   In the sections below, any option or parameter shown in square
   brackets ([]) is optional, and the vertical-bar (|) means "or".

2.1. NSLOOKUP

   NSLOOKUP is the name server lookup program that comes with many
   TCP/IP systems.  With NSLOOKUP, a user can determine a host system's
   IP address from its name or its name from the IP address.  The form
   of the command to make a single query is:

          NSLOOKUP  IP_address | host_name

   Alternatively, the program may be started by typing "NSLOOKUP"
   without any parameters.  At the prompt, the user can enter either an
   IP address or host name, and the program will respond with the name
   and address of the default name sever, the actual name server used to
   resolve each request, and the IP address and host name that was
   queried.  "Exit" is used to quit the NSLOOKUP application.

   Three queries are shown in the example below:

   1 Requests the address of the host named "emily.uvm.edu", a system at
     the University of Vermont (UVM).  As it turns out, this is not the
     true name of the host, but a shortened version of the name that is
     accepted as an alias by the network.  The full name of the host and
     the IP address are listed by NSLOOKUP.

   2 Requests the address of host "emily.emba.uvm.edu".  This is, of
     course, the same address as in the first query, but note that
     NSLOOKUP provides a "non-authoritative" answer.  Since NSLOOKUP
     just queried this same address, the information is still in its
     cache memory; therefore, rather than send additional messages to
     the name server, we get an answer that it remembers from before.
     Since we didn't look up the information again, it is not guaranteed
     to still be accurate (because the information might have changed
     within the last few milliseconds!).

   3 Requests the name of the host with the given IP address.  The
     result points to the Internet gateway to Australia, munnari.oz.au.

2.2. PING

   Ping is probably the most widely available tool available on TCP/IP
   systems and uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo
   messages.  The Ping command has the following general format:

     ping [-s] host_name [size] [quantity]

   In the first test below, we ping the host "thumper.bellcore.com" to
   determine whether it is up and running.  This simple use of the
   command contains no optional parameters.

   In the second test, we use the "-s" parameter to tell our system to
   send an ICMP Echo message every second.  The optional "size"
   parameter specifies that each message should be 64 bytes in length
   (which is the default size); the optional "quantity" parameter
   indicates that this test will only send 12 messages (the default is
   to run the test continuously until interrupted).  The results of the
   second test displays the round-trip delay of each Echo message that
   is returned to the sending host.  At the end of the test, summary
   statistics are displayed.

   =====================================================================

2.3. TRACEROUTE

   Traceroute is another common TCP/IP tool, this one allowing users to
   learn about the route that packets take from your system to a remote
   system; it provides some interesting information that can also be
   used as a powerful debugging aid.  Traceroute is sometimes packaged
   as an option of the Ping command.

   Traceroute works by sending a sequence of User Datagram Protocol
   (UDP) datagrams to an invalid port at the desired remote system.
   Using the default settings, three datagrams are sent, each with a
   Time-To-Live (TTL) field value set to one.  The TTL value of 1 causes
   the datagram to "timeout" as soon as it hits the first router in the
   path; this router will then respond with an ICMP error message
   indicating that the datagram has expired.  Another three UDP messages
   are now sent, each with the TTL value set to 2, which causes the
   second router to return ICMP replies.  This process continues until
   we actually reach the other destination.  Since these datagrams are
   trying to access an invalid port at the destination host, however,
   ICMP error messages are returned from the destination indicating an
   unavailable port; this event signals the Traceroute program that it
   is done!  The Traceroute program displays the round-trip delay
   associated with each of the attempts.  Note that the delay associated
   with the first message is usually longer than the two subsequent
   messages, which may be due to the use of the Address Resolution
   Protocol (ARP) to determine the route for the initial packet.

   The Traceroute command has the following general format (where "#"
   represents a positive integer value associated with the qualifier):

          traceroute [-m #] [-q #] [-w #] [-p #]

   where  -m   is the maximum allowable TTL value, measured in the
               number of hops allowed before the program terminates
               (default = 30)
          -q   is the number of UDP packets that will be sent with each
               time-to-live setting (default = 3)
          -w   is the amount of time, in seconds, to wait for an answer
               from a particular router before giving up (default = 5)
          -p   is the invalid port address at the remote host (default =
               33434)

   As an interesting aside, Traceroute did not begin life as a general-
   purpose utility, but as a quick-and-dirty debugging aid used to find
   a routing problem.  The code (complete with comments!) is available
   by anonymous FTP in the file "traceroute.tar.Z" from the host
   "ftp.ee.lbl.gov".

   The Traceroute example below shows the route between a VAX at St.
   Michael's College in Vermont (smcvax.smcvt.edu) and a system at
   Bellcore in New Jersey (thumper.bellcore.com).  The output has some
   interesting points:

   1 NEARnet is the New England Academic and Research Network, a
     regional network in the northeastern U.S.  The route runs from St.
     Mike's NEARnet gateway (smc-gw) to the University of Vermont (uvm),
     etc.  Note that some intermediate systems (see lines 4 and 16) do
     not have names associated with them.

   2 From NEARnet (lines 1-6), the datagrams traveled on the NSFNET's T3
     backbone (lines 7-11); note that the NSFNET backbone is identified
     as ans.net since it is operated by Advanced Networks and Services,
     Inc. (ANS).  The packet traveled within ANS' networks on their core
     nodal switching subsystems (designated "cnss") until it was ready
     to jump off the backbone; line 11 indicates an ANS exterior nodal
     switching subsystem ("enss").  After the NSFNET backbone, the
     datagrams were carried on the JvNCnet (lines 12-16), a regional
     network in New Jersey (note the use of SMDS!).  Finally, the
     datagrams are placed on Bellcore's internal network (lines 17 and
     18) for final delivery.

   3 Note that not all of the datagrams took the same route.  In
     particular, only two of the datagrams went through the ANS gateway
     referred to at line 10.  Note also line 17; here, the first two
     datagrams went through one router at Bellcore, while the third
     datagram went through a companion router.

2.4. FINGER

   The Finger program may be used to find out who is logged in on
   another system or to find out detailed information about a specific
   user.  This command has also introduced a brand new verb; "fingering"
   someone on the Internet is not necessarily a rude thing to do!  The
   Finger User Information Protocol is described in [uu].  The most
   general format of the Finger command is:

          FINGER [username]@host_name

   The first example below shows the result of fingering an individual
   user at a remote system.  The first line of the response shows the
   username, the user's real name, their process identifier,
   application, and terminal port number.  The remaining information is
   supplied, at the option of the user, in a "plan" file that they
   supply; this file is often named PLAN.TXT and resides in a user's
   root directory (or somewhere in an appropriate search path).

   The second example shows the result of fingering a remote system.
   This lists all of the processes currently running at the fingered
   system or other information, depending upon how the remote system's
   administrator set up the system to respond to the Finger command.

2.5. FTP

   The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) [vb] is one of the most useful and
   powerful TCP/IP applications for the general user.  FTP allows users
   to upload and download files between local and remote hosts.
   Anonymous FTP, in particular, is commonly available at file archive
   sites to allow users to access files without having to pre-establish
   an account at the remote host.

   FTP can be initiated in several ways.  In the example shown here, an
   FTP control connection is initiated to a host by using the command
   "FTP host_name".  Optionally, the host's IP address (in dotted
   decimal form) could be used instead of the host's name.  A third
   alternative would have been to start the FTP application by using
   only the command "FTP"; the connection to the host could then be
   initiated by typing the host_name, "OPEN host_name", or "OPEN
   IP_address".

   The remote host will now ask for a username and password.  If a
   username and password are supplied that identify a legitimate user of
   this host, the user will have access to any files and directories to
   which this username has privilege.  For anonymous FTP access, the
   username "anonymous" is used and the password (not shown in actual
   use) is "guest" (most systems ask that anonymous FTP users supply
   their Internet address as the password).

   The first command issued in the example below is "help ?", used to
   obtain a list of available FTP commands and help topics.  Although
   not always shown, nearly all TCP/IP applications have a help command.
   An example of the help for FTP's "type" command is shown in the
   sample dialogue.

   The "dir" command provides a directory listing of the files in the
   current directory; the UNIX-like "ls" command may also usually be
   used.  Note that a second FTP data transfer connection is established
   for the transfer of the directory information to the local host.  The
   output from the "dir" command will show a file listing that is
   consistent with the native operating system of the remote host.
   Although the TCP/IP suite is often associated with UNIX, it can (and
   does) run with nearly all common operating systems.  The directory
   information shown in the sample dialogue happens to be in UNIX format
   and includes the following information:

   o File attributes.  The first character identifies this as a
     directory (d), link (l), or individual file (-).  The next nine
     characters list the access permissions for three groups, namely,
     the owner, the owner's group, and all other users.  Three access
     privileges may be assigned to each file for each of these groups:
     read (r), write (w), execute (x), and/or search (s).

   o File owner and owner's group.

   o File size, in bytes.

   o Date of last modification.  If the date is followed by a timestamp,
     then the date is from the current year.

   o File name.

   After the directory information has been transferred, FTP closes the
   data transfer connection.

   The command "cd" is used to change to another directory, in this case
   the "Gov" directory (note that file and directory names may be case-
   sensitive).  As in DOS, "cd .." will change to the parent of the
   current directory.  The "CWD command successful" is the only
   indication that the user's "cd" command was correctly executed; use
   the "show-directory" (may be truncated to fewer characters, as shown)
   command at any time to see which directory you are in.

   Another "dir" command is used to find all files ending with the
   characters ".act"; note the use of the "*" wildcard character.  We
   can now copy the file of choice (The Fair Credit Reporting Act, 1992)
   by using the "get" (or "receive") command, which has the following
   general format:

     GET  remote_file_name  local_file_name

   FTP opens another data transfer connection for this file transfer
   purpose; note that the effective data transfer rate is 39.98 kbps.

   While the "get" command allows the downloading of files from a remote
   system to a local one, FTP's "put" (or "send") command allows
   uploading from the local host to the remote.  "Put" is typically not
   available when using anonymous FTP.

   Finally, we terminate the FTP connection by using the "close"
   command.  The user can initiate another FTP connection using the
   "open" command or can leave FTP by issuing a "quit" command.  "Quit"
   can also be used to close a connection and terminate a session.

   (It is important to note that different FTP packages have different
   commands available and even those with similar names may act
   differently.  In the example shown here, the "show" command will
   display the current directory.  In another package, "show" will
   display a file from the remote host at the local host.  Some packages
   have nothing equivalent to either of these!)

2.6. TELNET

   TELNET [vd] is TCP/IP's virtual terminal protocol.  Using TELNET, a
   user connected to one host can login to another host, appearing like
   a directly-attached terminal at the remote system; this is TCP/IP's
   definition of a "virtual terminal."  The general form of the TELNET
   command is:

          TELNET  [ip_address | host_name]  [port]

   As shown, a TELNET connection is initiated when the user enters the
   "TELNET" command and supplies either a "host_name" or "IP_address";
   if neither are given, TELNET will ask for one once the application
   begins.  In addition, a specific port number can be supplied if the
   user wishes to attach to a specific application at the remote host.
   (Examples of this last feature are shown in Sections 2.7.2 and 2.9.)

   In the example below, a user logged onto the host SMCVAX will use
   TELNET to attach to a host called EMILY at the University of Vermont.
   Once logged in via TELNET, the user can do anything that they could
   do if they were on a directly-connected terminal or had dialed-up by
   modem.  The commands that are used are available on the remote system
   to which we are TELNETed:

   o The "dir" command lists the available files and directories.
   o The "mail" command enters the MAIL system (there are no messages).
   o "Pinging" the SMCVAX host shows that it is alive!

   When finished, "logout" logs the user off the remote host; TELNET
   automatically closes the connection to the remote host and returns
   control to the local system.

2.7. User Database Lookup Tools

2.7.1. WHOIS/NICNAME

   WHOIS and NICNAME are TCP/IP applications that search databases to
   find the name of network and system administrators, RFC authors,
   system and network points-of-contact, and other individuals who are
   registered in appropriate databases.  The original NICNAME/WHOIS
   protocol is described in [vf].

   WHOIS may be accessed by TELNETing to an appropriate WHOIS server and
   logging in as "WHOIS" (no password is required); the most common
   Internet name server is located at the Internet Network Information
   Center (InterNIC) at rs.internic.net.  This specific database, in
   particular, only contains INTERNET domains, IP network numbers, and
   points of contact; policies governing the InterNIC database are
   described in [vh].  The MILNET database resides at NIC.DDN.MIL and
   PSI's White Pages pilot service is located at psi.com.

   Optionally, many software packages contain a WHOIS interface that
   automatically establishes the TELNET connection to an appropriate
   server.

   The accompanying dialogues shows both types of WHOIS access.  In the
   session below, we request information about an individual (Denis
   Stratford), a specific domain (smcvt.edu), and a high level domain
   (edu).

2.7.2. KNOWBOT

   KNOWBOT is an automated username database search tool that is related
   to WHOIS.  The Knowbot Information Service (KIS) provides a simple
   WHOIS-like interface that allows users to query a number of Internet
   user databases (White Pages services) all at one time.  A single KIS
   query will automatically search the InterNIC, MILNET, MCImail, and
   PSI White Pages Pilot Project; other databases may also be included.

   KNOWBOT may be accessed by TELNETing to port 185 on hosts
   INFO.CNRI.RESTON.VA.US or SOL.BUCKNELL.EDU.  The "help" command will
   supply sufficient information to get started.  The sample dialogue
   below shows use of the "query" command to locate a user named Tom
   Maufer; this command automatically starts a search through the
   default set of Internet databases.

2.7.3. NETFIND

   NETFIND is another tool that may be used to locate people on the
   network.  NETFIND's advantage is that it searches for users by
   utilizing extant tools such as Finger and SMTP, thus providing the
   potential to find any users on any host without relying on databases.
   For NETFIND to be successful, however, the system manager of existing
   systems must set up Finger and SMTP to respond correctly to NETFIND's
   queries.  NETFIND is still relatively new and use will grow over
   time.

   NETFIND is a menu-driven, text-based system.  Users need to TELNET to
   an available NETFIND server.  Once connected, login as "netfind"
   (must be lower-case; no password required) and follow the menu
   prompts.  The sample dialogue below shows the search for "Tom
   Maufer", who I know works at Goddard Space Flight Center ("gsfc"), a
   part of NASA ("nasa gov").

   The primary NETFIND server is located at the University of Colorado
   in Boulder (BRUNO.CS.COLORADO.EDU).  Currently available alternate
   servers include:

2.8. Information Servers

2.8.1. ARCHIE

   Archie is a database server, originally developed at the Computer
   Science Department of McGill University in Montreal.  Its intent is
   to allow users to find documents and software that reside at open
   file transfer sites and have been registered with Archie; by early
   1994, more than three million files at 1,500 locations had been
   registered.  This program has become so popular that many sites now
   provide the Archie service.

   Before using Archie, you must identify an appropriate server
   location.  The sites below all support Archie and there may be more;
   most (but not all) Archie sites support the "servers" command which
   lists all known Archie servers.  Due to the popularity of Archie and
   its high processing demands, many sites limit access to non-peak
   hours and/or limit the number of simultaneous Archie users.
   Available Archie sites include:

     archie.au*                  139.130.4.6     Australia
     archie.edvz.uni-linz.ac.at* 140.78.3.8      Austria
     archie.univie.ac.at*        131.130.1.23    Austria
     archie.uqam.ca*             132.208.250.10  Canada
     archie.funet.fi             128.214.6.100   Finland
     archie.th-darmstadt.de*     130.83.22.60    Germany
     archie.ac.il*               132.65.6.15     Israel
     archie.unipi.it*            131.114.21.10   Italy
     archie.wide.ad.jp           133.4.3.6       Japan
     archie.hana.nm.kr*          128.134.1.1     Korea
     archie.sogang.ac.kr*        163.239.1.11    Korea
     archie.uninett.no*          128.39.2.20     Norway

     archie.luth.se*             130.240.18.4    Sweden
     archie.switch.ch*           130.59.1.40     Switzerland
     archie.ncu.edu.tw*          140.115.19.24   Taiwan
     archie.doc.ic.ac.uk*        146.169.11.3    United Kingdom
     archie.unl.edu              129.93.1.14     USA (NE)
     archie.internic.net*        198.48.45.10    USA (NJ)
     archie.rutgers.edu*         128.6.18.15     USA (NJ)
     archie.ans.net              147.225.1.10    USA (NY)
     archie.sura.net*            128.167.254.179 USA (MD)

     Note: Sites marked with an asterisk "*" run archie version 3.0.

   Archie servers may be accessed using TELNET.  When TELNETing to an
   Archie site, login as "archie" (you MUST use lower case); no password
   will be required.  Some packages now supply an Archie interface that
   hides this step; you can attach to a pre-configured Archie server
   merely by typing "ARCHIE".

   Once connected, the "help" command assists users in obtaining more
   information about using Archie.  Two more useful Archie commands are
   "prog", used to search for files in the database, and "whatis", which
   searches for keywords in the program descriptions.

   In the accompanying dialogue, the "set maxhits" command is used to
   limit the number of responses to any following "prog" commands; if
   this is not done, the user may get an enormous amount of information!
   In this example, the user issues a request to find entries related to
   "mpeg", ISO's Moving Pictures Experts Group video compression
   algorithm.  The first two responses indicate a directory named "mpeg"
   at academic sites in Australia (...edu.au).  The next three responses
   show other directories with this name at sites in Sweden (...se).
   Armed with this information, a user can use anonymous FTP to examine
   these directories and download files.

   The next request is for files with "security" as a keyword
   descriptor.  These responses can be used for subsequent "prog"
   commands.

   Exit archie using the "exit" command.  At this point, TELNET closes
   the connection and control returns to the local host.

   Current information about Archie can be obtained by sending e-mail to
   Bunyip Information Systems in Canada (archie-info@bunyip.com).
   Archie client software is not required to use Archie, but can make
   life a little easier; some such software can be found in the
   "/pub/archie/" path at host "ftp.cs.widener.edu".

2.8.2. GOPHER

   Gopher is a distributed document search and retrieval protocol for
   the Internet.  The Internet Gopher protocol was developed by the
   Microcomputer Center at the University of Minnesota in 1991 and is
   described in [vj].

   Gopher is a hierarchical, menu-based system and users need some type
   of client software to use Gopher servers.  In many cases, users can
   access Gopher by TELNETing to a valid Gopher location that provides
   Gopher client support locally; in this case, the client typically
   provides a text-based, menu interface.  The number of Gopher sites is
   growing rapidly; as the dialogue below shows, most Gopher sites have
   a menu item that will allow you to identify other Gopher sites.  If
   using TELNET, login with the username "gopher" (this MUST be in
   lowercase); no password is required.

   If using a menu-based interface, the user merely follows the prompts
   as shown in the dialogue below.  Initially, the main menu will
   appear; selecting item 1 causes Gopher to seize the "Information
   about Gopher" menu.  This menu also has sub-menus, which are not
   shown here.  To quit the program at any time, press the "q" key; "?"
   and "u" will provide help or go back up to the previous menu,
   respectively.  Users may also search for strings within files (using
   the "/" command) or download the file being interrogated (using the
   "D" command).

   The Gopher server at is.internic.net has a tremendous amount of
   information for the new user, including lists of frequently asked
   questions and pointers to various Internet discussion lists.  That is
   the site shown in the sample dialogue below.  After establishing a
   connection and logging on, a root menu is displayed.  Item 7 is
   titled "Getting Started on the Internet," we move to that menu merely
   by entering a "7" or by moving the arrow (-->) down to the desired
   entry (using the <DOWN-ARROW> key on the keyboard) and hitting
   <ENTER>.  Quit the program by typing "q" at any menu.

   Further information about Gopher can be obtained by contacting the
   Internet Gopher Team at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis
   (gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu).  This is also the site of the first
   Gopher server (consultant.micro.umn.edu).  A Gopher-related
   discussion list is maintained at gopher-news@boombox.micro.umn.edu
   (see Section 2.10.1 for information on subscribing to discussion
   lists).  More information on Gopher clients can be found in the
   Gopher Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file, which can be accessed
   by anonymous ftp from path "/pub/usenet/news.answers/gopher-faq" at
   the host "rtfm.mit.edu".  This FAQ also lists sources of a number of
   Gopher clients for a wide range of hardware/software platforms.

2.8.3. Other Information Servers

   There are a number of other information servers that are growing in
   popularity and use, although Archie and Gopher remain the two premier
   information access and retrieval tools.  The problem with being
   blessed with so much information from Archie, Gopher, and other
   sources is exactly that -- too much information.  To make it easier
   for users to locate the system on which their desired information
   resides, a number of other tools have been created.

   Veronica (Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to Computerized
   Archives) was developed at the University of Nevada as an adjunct to
   Gopher.  Whereas Gopher is designed to search a single database at a
   time, Veronica performs a keyword search on all of the Gopher sites
   that it has knowledge of and access to.  When a user selects an item
   from the menu of a Veronica search, "sessions" are automatically
   established with the appropriate Gopher servers, all transparent to
   the user.

   Archie and Gopher are primarily used for the indexing of text-based
   files.  The World Wide Web (WWW or W3) Project is designed to combine
   aspects of information retrieval with multimedia communications.  The
   WWW Project is intended to allow users to access information in many
   different types of formats, including text and image.   WWW treats
   all searchable Internet files as hypertext documents, allowing the
   user to create non-linear, non-hierarchical linkages between data
   points.  The primary WWW site is at the CERN Institute in
   Switzerland, and may be accessed via Telnet at "nxoc01.cern.ch".  The
   user will be automatically logged in and a help menu can be displayed
   by entering the "h" command.  WWW sources and additional information
   may be accessed via anonymous FTP from the "/pub/WWW" directory at
   "info.cern.ch" or the "/Web/" directory at "ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu".

   The Wide Area Information Server (WAIS, pronounced "ways") was
   initiated as a joint venture between Apple Computer, Dow Jones, and
   KMPG Peat Marwick, and Thinking Machines Corp.  WAIS provides a
   single interface through which a user can access many different
   information databases.  The user interface allow a query to be
   formulated in English and the WAIS server will automatically choose
   the appropriate databases to search.  Further information about WAIS
   can be obtained by reading the WAIS FAQ, available from host
   "rtfm.mit.edu" in file "/pub/usenet/news.answers/wais-faq".

   [[draft paragraph... more info to follow...]]
   Mosaic is a tool  that can be used to navigate through the WWW.
   Mosaic supports multimedia presentations that are available on the
   Web, information that might include text, image, or video.  Mosaic
   provides a uniform mechanism for finding the location of information,
   as well as determining the data type, presentation method, and
   linkages to other information.  Mosaic sites are referenced in the
   form:

          http://"host_name"/"path"/"filename".html

   The "http" indicates that this is the default home page, where the
   Mosaic application will start; the ".html" file extension indicates
   use of the HyperText Multimedia Language.  A large number of Mosaic
   clients are available at "ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu".

2.9. Electronic Mail and SMTP

   Electronic mail, or e-mail, is the biggest single use of the
   Internet.  The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) [vl] is the mail
   transfer application used across TCP/IP-based networks, although most
   users never use SMTP directly; instead they use their host system's
   native mail application, which uses SMTP services.  Because most end
   users do not directly use SMTP and they do not usually write their
   own SMTP gateway software, this section describes SMTP only for
   completeness and to compare SMTP to some MAIL software.

   Native SMTP is neither easy to use, intuitive, nor fast.  It is, on
   the other hand, simple and does provide the majority of the basic
   mail services that users demand.  In the dialogue below, user KUMQUAT
   at host SMCVAX wants to send mail to user HILL at host EMILY.  SMTP
   at EMILY is accessed by opening a TELNET connection, specifying
   TCP/IP port 25, a port that is always associated with the SMTP
   application.  Note that after TELNETing to port 25, EMILY completes
   the connection without requesting a login or password.

   SMTP's HELO command is used to tell EMILY which host it is being
   accessing from; EMILY responds politely, as do most SMTP hosts!  We
   are now ready to send mail.

   The sender uses the MAIL FROM: command to identify themselves.  The
   RCPT TO: command is used to identify the intended recipient; any
   number of intended receivers may be specified, and SMTP will verify
   whether the specified users are known or not.  Note that these
   commands require that the user identifier be placed within angle
   brackets (<>).

   When ready to send the message, the DATA command is used.  The sender
   signals the end of the message by typing a line that contains nothing
   but a period (.).  The user could now send more messages to users at
   this remote host or exit SMTP using QUIT.  In the dialogue below, a
   second message is sent to the same recipient using the local host
   system's native e-mail, for comparison purposes only.

   E-mail is a tremendously important topic and much more detailed
   information may be found in [vr].

2.10. Getting More Information On-line...

2.10.1. Discussion Lists

   Among the most useful features of the Internet are the discussion
   lists that have become available to allow individuals to discuss
   topics of mutual concern.  Discussion list topics range from SCUBA
   diving and home brewing of beer to AIDS research and data
   communications.  Several, naturally, deal specifically with the
   Internet, TCP/IP protocols, and the impact of new technologies.

   Most of the available lists are "unmoderated."  This means that
   anyone can send a message to the list's central repository and the
   message will then be automatically forwarded to all subscribers of
   the list.  These lists provide very fast turn-around between
   submission of a message and delivery, but often results in a lot of
   messages.  A "moderated" list has an extra step; a human list
   moderator examines all messages before they are forwarded to ensure
   that the messages are appropriate to the list and not needlessly
   inflammatory!

2.10.1.1. Internet Discussion Lists

   A list of the known interest groups may be found by Gophering to
   is.internic.net.  Follow the menu path "Getting Started on the
   Internet" (item #7), "Things to Do on the Internet" (4), "Resources"
   (1), and "Interest Group Mailing Lists (List of Lists)" (3).  Along
   the way, you will find another wealth of information.  The "list of
   lists" file may also be downloaded using anonymous FTP from
   is.internic.net; use the file name "infosource/getting-
   started/things-to-do-internet/resource-lists/interest-groups".
   Alternatively, send an e-mail message to "MAIL-SERVER@NISC.SRI.COM",
   leave the "Subject:" field blank, and place the line "send
   INTEREST-GROUPS" in the main body of the message.  Be careful if you
   download this file; it is nearly 1.4 MB is size, listing over 800
   lists!

   Most Internet list names are of the form:

          list_name@host_name

   The common convention when users want to subscribe, unsubscribe, or
   handle any other administrative matter, is to send a message to:

          list_name-REQUEST@host_name

   Not every list follows this exact convention, but it is a safe bet if
   you don't have better information!

2.10.1.2. USENET

   USENET, also known as NETNEWS, is another information source with its
   own set of special interest mailing lists.  USENET originated on UNIX
   systems but has migrated to many other types of hosts.  While the
   USENET lists are accessible from Internet sites, the host must have
   appropriate software to be able to read the USENET feed.  Users will
   have to check with their system administrator to find out what USENET
   lists are locally available.  USENET is rapidly growing in popularity
   and there are more than 400 discussion groups available through
   USENET.

   USENET newsgroups use names that are hierarchical in nature, somewhat
   similar to the Internet address name format.  The first part of the
   name, called the "hierarchy", provides an indication about the
   general subject area.  There are two types of hierarchies, called
   "mainstream" and "alternative".

   Usenet mainstream hierarchies are established by a process that
   requires the approval of Usenet members.  Most sites that receive a
   NETNEWS feed receive all of these hierarchies, which include:

     comp           Computers
     misc           Miscellaneous
     news           Network news
     rec            Recreation
     sci            Science
     soc            Social issues
     talk           Various discussion lists

   The alternative hierarchies include lists that may be set up by any
   site that has the know how, server software, and disk space.  These
   lists are not formally part of Usenet and, therefore, may not be
   received by all sites getting NETNEWS.  The alternative hierarchies
   include:

     alt            Alternate miscellaneous discussion lists
     bionet         Biology, medicine, and life sciences
     bit            BITNET discussion lists
     biz            Various business-related discussion lists
     ddn            Defense Data Network
     gnu            GNU lists
     ieee           IEEE information
     info           Various Internet and other networking information
     k12            K-12 education
     u3b            AT&T 3B computers
     vmsnet         Digital's VMS operating system

   These 18 Usenet hierarchies comprise more than 2,300 discussion
   lists.  A list of these groups may be found at host "rtfm.mit.edu",
   in the path "/pub/usenet/news.answers"; see the "active-newsgroups"
   and "alt-hierarchies" subdirectories.

   There is often some overlap between USENET and Internet discussion
   lists.  Many individuals join both lists (if possible) in these
   circumstances or, often, there is cross-posting of messages.  Some
   USENET lists are forwarded onto the Internet by an individual site to
   provide access to those users who do not have USENET available.

   Users with access to Internet e-mail but not Usenet may still post
   messages to a Usenet list.  First, replace the periods in the Usenet
   discussion list name to hyphens (e.g., the folk music discussion
   list, "rec.music.folk", would become "rec-music-folk").  Then, send
   an e-mail message to:

          newsgroup_name@CS.UTEXAS.EDU

   Finally, Usenet news may be accessed through Gopher.  Connect to
   "gopher.msu.edu" using the path "News & Weather", "USENET News" or
   "gopher.bham.ac.uk" using the path "Usenet News Reader".

2.10.1.3  BITNET/EARN

   Another important set of discussion groups is maintained using a
   program called LISTSERV.  LISTSERV is a service provided widely on
   BITNET and EARN, although it is also available to Internet users.

   LISTSERV commands are placed in the main body of e-mail messages sent
   to an appropriate mail server location.  To find out what lists are
   available, send a message to LISTSERV@BITNIC.EDUCOM.EDU with the
   command "list global" in the main body of the message; whatever you
   place in the "Subject" field: will be ignored.

   Once you have found a list of interest, you can send a message to the
   appropriate address with any appropriate command, including:

     HELP                               Get help & a list of commands
     SUBSCRIBE list_name your_full_name Subscribe to a list
     UNSUBSCRIBE list_name              Unsubscribe from a list
     INDEX                              Get a list of LISTSERV files
     GET file_name                      Obtain a file from the server

2.10.2. Request for Comments (RFCs)

   To fully understand what is going on within the Internet community,
   users might wish to obtain the occasional Request for Comments, or
   RFC.  RFCs are the body of literature comprising Internet protocols,
   standards, research questions, humor (especially those dated 1
   April), and general information.  Each RFC is uniquely issued a 4-
   digit number which is never reused or reissued; if a document is
   revised, it is given a new RFC number and the old RFC is said to be
   "obsoleted."  Announcements are sent to the RFC-DIST mailing list
   whenever a new RFC is issued; anyone may join this list by sending e-
   mail to rfc-request@nic.ddn.mil.

   RFCs may be obtained through the mail, but it is easier and faster to
   get them on-line.  Detailed information on how to do this may be
   obtained by using RFC-INFO, an e-mail-based service to help users
   locate and retrieve RFCs, Internet Monthly Reports, and FYI
   documents.  To use the service, send e-mail to rfc-info@isi.edu and
   leave the "Subject:" field blank.  Commands go in the main body of
   the message:

     HELP                     (Help file)
     HELP: ways_to_get_rfcs   (Help file on how to get RFCs)

     RETRIEVE: RFC
        Doc-ID: RFCxxxx       (Retrieve RFC xxxx)

     LIST: RFC                (List all RFCs...)
       [options]                 (...[matching the following options])

       KEYWORDS: xxx             (Title contains string "xxx")
       AUTHOR: xxx               (Written by "xxx")
       ORGANIZATION:             (Issued by company "xxx")
       DATED-AFTER: mmm-dd-yyyy
       DATED-BEFORE: mmm-dd-yyyy
       OBSOLETES: RFCxxxx        (List RFCs obsoleting RFC xxxx)

   To get an RFC on-line without using RFC-INFO, you need two things;
   namely, the Internet address of an RFC repository and the RFC number.
   The primary RFC repositories throughout the world include those
   listed in Table 1.  The RFC index, or a specific reference for an
   RFC, will indicate whether the RFC exists in ASCII text or PostScript
   format; by convention, all RFCs are available in ASCII while some are
   also available in PostScript where that adds more information or
   clarity.  The instructions below show how to get the index; be aware
   that this file is very large, containing the citing for over 1600
   documents.


   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   TABLE 1.  Some of the RFC Repositories.

   REGION    HOST ADDRESS          DIRECTORY     E-MAIL SERVER

   U.S.      venera.isi.edu        in-notes    rfc-index@isi.edu
   U.S.      wuarchive.wustl.edu   info/rfc    (none)
   U.S.      nic.ddn.mil           rfc         service@nic.ddn.mil
   U.S.      nisc.jvnc.net         rfc         sendrfc@jvnc.net
   U.K.      src.doc.ic.ac.uk      rfc         info-server@doc.ic.ac.uk
   Europe    funet.fi              rfc         archive-server@funet.fi
   Pacific   munnari.oz.au         rfc         (none)
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   There are two mechanisms for on-line retrieval of RFCs, namely, by
   using an electronic mail server or via anonymous FTP.  To obtain RFCs
   using the electronic mail server, send an e-mail message to an
   appropriate mail server listed in Table 1 and leave the "Subject:"
   field blank.  In the main body of the message, use one or more of the
   following commands (where "dir" is replaced with the directory name
   as shown in Table 1):

     SEND HELP                (Help file)
     SEND dir/RFC-INDEX       (RFC Index)
     SEND dir/RFCxxxx.TXT     (ASCII version of RFC xxxx)
     SEND dir/RFCxxxx.PS      (PostScript version of RFC xxxx)

   To obtain RFCs using anonymous FTP, login to one of the RFC servers
   listed in Table 1 with the username "anonymous" and password "guest".
   After logging in, change to the appropriate RFC directory (as shown
   in Table 1) using the "cd" command.  To obtain a particular file, use
   the "get" command:

     GET RFC-INDEX.txt local_name       (RFC Index)
     GET RFCxxxx.txt   local_name       (ASCII version of RFC XXXX)
     GET RFCxxxx.ps    local_name       (PostScript version of RFC XXXX)

2.10.3  Internet Standards

   RFCs describe many aspects of the Internet.  Over the years, however,
   so many specifications of various protocols had been written that it
   was not always clear as to which documents represented standards for
   the Internet.  For that reason, a subset of RFCs have been designated
   as STDs to identify the Internet standards.

   Unlike RFC numbers that are never reused, STD numbers always refer to
   the latest version of the standard.  UDP, for example, would be
   completely identified as "STD-6/RFC-768."  Note that STD numbers
   refer to a standard, which is not necessarily a single document; an
   STD, therefore, might refer to several RFCs.  STD 19, for example, is
   the NetBIOS Service Protocols standard and comprises RFCs 1001 and
   1002; a complete citation for this standard would be "STD-19/RFC-
   1001/RFC-1002."  STDs are obtained in the same way as RFCs.

   The availability of new STDs is announced on the RFC-DIST mailing
   list.  STD-1 [vn] always refers to the latest list of "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards".  The Internet standards process is
   described more in [vo] and the STD notes are explained in [vq].

2.10.4  Getting FYIs

   The For Your Information (FYI) series of RFCs provides Internet users
   with information about many topics related to the Internet.  FYI
   topics range from historical to explanatory to tutorial, and are
   aimed at the wide spectrum of users that access the Internet.  The
   FYI series includes answers to frequently asked questions by both
   beginning and seasoned users of the Internet, an annotated
   bibliography of Internet books, and an explanation of the DNS.

   Like the STDs, an FYI number always refers to the latest version of
   an FYI.  FYI 4, for example, refers to the answers to commonly asked
   questions by new Internet users; its complete citation would be "FYI-
   4/RFC-1594."

   FYIs can be obtained as RFCs via anonymous FTP from any RFC
   repository.  In addition, some RFC sites (such as NIC.DDN.MIL),
   provide an FYI directory so that FYI documents can be found using the
   path /FYI/mm.TXT, where "mm" refers to the FYI number.  FYIs can also
   be obtained by an automatic mail service; send an e-mail message to
   SERVICE@NIC.DDN.MIL and place the command "SEND FYI/FYImm.TXT" in the
   main body of the message.

   The availability of new FYIs is announced on the RFC-DIST mailing
   list.  The FYI notes are explained in FYI-1 [vs].

2.10.5. Perusing the Internet...

   This RFC is intended to provide the reader with the most rudimentary
   ability to use the utilities that are provided by TCP/IP and the
   Internet.  By now, it is clear that the knowledge and ability of the
   user is one of the only limits to what can be accomplished.

   The next step after basic use of the tools is to explore the nooks
   and crannies of the network.  Several software tools are available to
   help users in this quest.  Among them are:

   o Merit Computer Center (Ann Arbor, MI) offers "Cruise of the
     Internet" software for Macs and PCs that can display 256 colors.
     The software is available for no cost from the host nic.merit.edu.
     For more information, read the READ.ME file and/or contact
     cruise2feedback@merit.edu.

   o A "Tour of the Internet" is available from BBN Systems and
     Technologies (Cambridge, MA) for Macintosh system 6.0.5 or higher
     equipped with HyperCard 2.  The software is available by anonymous
     FTP in the directory internet-tour on the host nnsc.nsf.net.  For
     more information, contact nnsc@nnsc.nsf.net or call BBN at +1 617-
     873-3400.

   Several RFCs also provide invaluable information about finding things
   on the Internet.  One of the best such sources is FYI 10/RFC 1402,
   titled "There's Gold in them thar Networks! -or- Searching for
   Treasure in all the Wrong Places" [vt], an excellent guide for
   someone who wants to look around the Internet for a wide range of
   material.  Other good sources are the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the
   Internet" (RFC 1118) [vm] and the "Guide to Network Resource Tools"
   (FYI 23/RFC 1580) [vv].  Answers to frequently asked questions by
   both new and experienced users of the Internet may be found in FYI
   4/RFC 1594 [vx] and FYI 7/RFC 1207 [vz], respectively.

   In addition, more books and specialized articles came out about the
   Internet in 1993 than in all previous years (squared!).  Some of them
   are directly related to finding your way around or finding things on
   the Internet, including:

   o "The Internet Directory" by Eric Braun [wa]

   o "The PC Internet Tour Guide" by Michael Fraase [ap]

   o "Navigating the Internet" by Mark Gibbs and Richard Smith [wc]

   o "The Internet Navigator" by Paul Gilster [wo]

   o "The Internet Yellow Pages" by Harley Hahn and Rick Stout [aq]

   o "Zen and the Art of the Internet" by Brendan Kehoe [we]

   o "The Whole Internet User's Guide & Catalog" by Ed Krol [wg]

   o "Users' Directory of Computer Networks" edited by Tracy LaQuey [xa]

   o "INTERNET: Getting Started" by April Marine, Susan Kirkpatrick,
     Vivian Neou, and Carol Ward [wi]

   o "Finding it on the Internet: The Next Challenge for Librarianship"
     by Brian Nielsen [wk]

   A much more comprehensive list of Internet-related books may be found
   in RFC 1463/FYI 19 [az].

   Finally, Carl Malamud has written a delightful book called "Exploring
   the Internet: A Technical Travelogue" [wm], chronicling not the
   Internet as much as the people who use it.  This book will not teach
   you how to perform an anonymous FTP file transfer nor how to use
   Gopher, but provides insights that no mere statistics can convey.

2.10.6  Getting Connected

   This document is based upon the premise that "access to the Internet"
   means more than just electronic mail.  For this guide, "access to the
   Internet" means access to the complete suite of TCP/IP tools and
   utilities, including some or all of the ones listed above.

   There are a number of ways in which users can access the Internet,
   either as an individual or a company over dial-up or leased lines
   through a regional or national Internet access provider.  This RFC
   will not suggest any particular method nor carrier; this will not be
   an issue for most end-users anyway.  There are a variety of sources
   available that identify the different access providers; an on-line
   list is available via Gopher at "is.internic.net".  Optionally, send
   an e-mail message to "mail-server@nisc.sri.com", leave the subject
   line blank, and place one or both of the following commands in the
   main body of the message:

          send INTERNET-ACCESS-PROVIDERS-NON-US.TXT
          send INTERNET-ACCESS-PROVIDERS-US.TXT
