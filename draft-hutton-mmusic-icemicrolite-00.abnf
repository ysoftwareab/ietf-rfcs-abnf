a=candidate:1 1 UDP 2130706431 192.0.2.1 0 typ host microliteport 3478

   This extension does not use the port field of the regular a=candidate
   attribute, but rather provides the port in an extension called
   microliteport.  An ICE-microLite implementation will set the value of
   the regular port field to "0".  Consequently, implementations which
   support ICE according to [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice], but are not ICE-
   microLite aware will not find a default candidate matching port and
   IP address in the SDP's m/c-line, will detect an ICE mismatch and
   will fall-back to default SDP processing.

   An example of an SDP offer using this mechanism is as follows when
   IPv6 is preferred but IPv4 is the fall back option.
