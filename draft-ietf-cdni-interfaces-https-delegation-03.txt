                  CDNI extensions for HTTPS delegation
             draft-ietf-cdni-interfaces-https-delegation-03

Abstract

   The delivery of content over HTTPS involving multiple CDNs raises
   credential management issues.  This document proposes extensions in
   CDNI Control and Metadata interfaces to setup HTTPS delegation from
   an Upstream CDN (uCDN) to a Downstream CDN (dCDN).

1.  Introduction

   Content delivery over HTTPS using one or more CDNs along the path
   requires credential management.  This specifically applies when an
   entity delegates delivery of encrypted content to another trusted
   entity.

   Several delegation methods are currently proposed within different
   IETF working groups.  They specify different methods for provisioning
   HTTPS delivery credentials.

   This document extends the CDNI Metadata interface to setup HTTPS
   delegation between an upstream CDN (uCDN) and downstream CDN (dCDN)
   using the Standardized delegation methods.  Furthermore, it includes
   a proposal of IANA registry to enable adding of new methods.

   Section 2 is about terminology used in this document.  Section 3
   presents delegation methods specified at the IETF.  Section 4
   addresses the extension for handling HTTPS delegation in CDNI.
   Section 5 describes simple data types.  Section 6 addresses IANA
   registry for delegation methods.  Section 7 covers the security
   issues.  Section 8 is about comments and questions.

Internet-Draft    CDNI extensions for HTTPS delegation        March 2020


2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from CDNI framework documents such as:
   CDNI framework document [RFC7336], CDNI requirements [RFC7337] and
   CDNI interface specifications documents: CDNI Metadata interface
   [RFC8006] and CDNI Control interface / Triggers [RFC8007].

3.  Known delegation methods

   There are currently two Internet drafts within the TLS and ACME
   working groups adopted to handle delegation of HTTPS delivery between
   entities.

   This Internet Draft (I-D) proposes standardizing HTTPS delegation
   between the entities using CDNI interfaces.

   This document considers the following two I-Ds that deals with HTTPS
   delegation:

   - Sub-certificates [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts] in the TLS Working Group.

   - Short-term, Automatically-Renewed (STAR) certificates in Automated
   Certificate Management Environment(ACME) [I-D.ietf-acme-star]

4.  Extending the CDNI metadata model

   This section defines a CDNI extension to the current Metadata
   interface model that allows bootstrapping delegation methods between
   a uCDN and a delegate dCDN.

4.1.  Extension to PathMetadata object

   This extension reuses PathMetadata object, as defined in [RFC8006],
   and adds new "Delegation methods" objects as specified in the
   following sections.

   This allows to explicitly indicate support for a given method.
   Therefore, the presence (or lack thereof) of an
   AcmeStarDelegationMethod, SubcertsDelegationMethod, and/or further
   delegation methods, imply support (or lack thereof) for the given
   method.

   Example:

   The PathMatch object can reference a path-metadata that points at the
   delegation information.  Delegation metadata are added to
   PathMetaData object.

Internet-Draft    CDNI extensions for HTTPS delegation        March 2020


   Below shows both PathMatch and PathMetaData objects related to a
   path, for example, here /movies/* located at
   https://metadata.ucdn.example/video.example.com/movies


PathMatch:
{
 "path-pattern": {
      "pattern": "/movies/*",
      "case-sensitive": true
 },
 "path-metadata": {
   "type": "MI.PathMetadata",
      "href": "https://metadata.ucdn.example/video.example.com/movies"
 }
}

Following the example above, the PathMetadata can be modeled
for ACMEStarDelegationMethod as:

PathMetadata:
{
    "metadata": [
     {
        "generic-metadata-type": "MI.AcmeStarDelegationMethod",
        "generic-metadata-value": {
           "star-proxy": "10.2.2.2",
           "acme-server" : "10.2.3.3",
           "credentials-location-uri": "www.ucdn.com/credentials",
           "periodicity": 36000,
           "CSR-template": Json/Text representing the CSR template (see section 4.2)
     }}]
}


   The existence of the "MI.AcmeStarDelegationMethod" object in a
   PathMetaData Object shall enable the use of one of the
   AcmeStarDelegation Methods, chosen by the delegating entity.  The
   delegation method will be activated for the set of Path defined in
   the PathMatch.  See Section 4.2 for more details about delegation
   methods metadata specification.

4.2.  Delegation methods

   This section defines the delegation methods objects metadata.  Those
   metadata allows bootstrapping a secured delegation by providing the
   dCDN with the needed parameters to set it up.

4.2.1.  AcmeStarDelegationMethod object

   This section defines the AcmeStarDelegationMethod object which
   describes metadata related to the use of ACME/STAR API presented in
   [I-D.ietf-acme-star]

   As expressed in [I-D.ietf-acme-star], when an origin has set a
   delegation to a specific domain (i.e. dCDN), the dCDN should present
   to the end-user client, a short-term certificate bound to the master
   certificate.

   Figure 2: Example call-flow of SubCert delegation in CDNI


   As expressed in [I-D.ietf-tls-subcerts], when an origin has set a
   delegation to a downstream entity such as a downstream CDN (i.e.
   dCDN), the dCDN should present the Origin or uCDN certificate or
   "delegated_credential" during the TLS handshake [RFC8446] to the end-
   user client application, instead of its own certificate.

6.1.  CDNI MI AcmeStarDelegationMethod Payload Type

   Purpose: The purpose of this Payload Type is to distinguish
   AcmeStarDelegationMethod MI objects (and any associated capability
   advertisement)

   Interface: MI/FCI

   Encoding: see Section 4.2.1

6.2.  CDNI MI SubCertsDelegationMethod Payload Type

   Purpose: The purpose of this Payload Type is to distinguish
   SubcertsDelegationMethod MI objects (and any associated capability
   advertisement)

   Interface: MI/FCI

   Encoding: see Section 4.2.2

7.  Security considerations

   Extensions proposed here do not alter nor change Security
   Considerations as outlined in the CDNI Metadata and Footprint and
   Capabilities RFCs [RFC8006].

8.  Comments and questions

   Should dCDN be visible from the Content Provider or not?  This would
   lead to different solutions to handle delegation towards the CP.  In
   most cases, the dCDNs should never be visible to the CP, in order to
   reduce the burden of certificates generation for dCDN.
