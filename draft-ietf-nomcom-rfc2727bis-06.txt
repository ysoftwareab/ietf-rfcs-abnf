Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


1. Introduction

   This document is a revision of and supercedes RFC2727. [2] It is a
   complete specification of the process by which members of the IAB and
   IESG are selected, confirmed, and recalled as of the date of its
   approval.

   The following two assumptions continue to be true of this
   specification.

   1.  The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) and Internet Research
       Steering Group (IRSG) are not a part of the process described
       here.

   2.  The organization (and re-organization) of the IESG is not a part
       of the process described here.

   The time frames specified here use IETF meetings as a frame of
   reference.  The time frames assume that the IETF meets three times
   per calendar year with approximately equal amounts of time between
   them. The meetings are referred to as the First IETF, Second IETF, or
   Third IETF as needed.

   The next section lists the words and phrases commonly used throughout
   this document with their intended meaning.

   The majority of this document is divided into four major topics as
   follows.

   General: This a set of rules and constraints that apply to the
      selection and confirmation process as a whole.

   Nominating Committee Selection: This is the process by which the
      volunteers who will serve on the committee are recognized.

   Nominating Committee Operation: This is the set of principles, rules,
      and constraints that guide the activities of the nominating
      committee, including the confirmation process.

   Member Recall: This is the process by which the behavior of a sitting
      member of the IESG or IAB may be questioned, perhaps resulting in
      the removal of the sitting member.

   A final section describes how this document differs from its
   predecessor: RFC2727. [2]

   An appendix of useful facts and practices collected from previous
   nominating committees is also included.

2. Definitions

   The following words and phrases are commonly used throughout this
   document.  They are listed here with their intended meaning for the
   convenience of the reader.

   candidate: A nominee who has been selected to be considered for
      confirmation by a confirming body.

   confirmed candidate: A candidate that has been reviewed and approved
      by a confirming body.

   nominating committee term: The term begins when its members are
      officially announced, which is expected to be prior to the Third
      IETF to ensure it is fully operational at the Third IETF.  The
      term ends at the Third IETF (not three meetings) after the next
      nominating committee's term begins.

   nominee: A person who is being or has been considered for one or more
      open positions of the IESG or IAB.

   sitting member: A person who is currently serving a term of
      membership in the IESG, IAB or ISOC Board of Trustees.

3. General

   The following set of rules apply to the process as a whole.  If
   necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is
   included.

   1.  The annual process is expected to be completed within 7 months.

       The annual process is expected to be completed one month prior to
       the Friday of the week before the First IETF.  It is expected to
       begin at least 8 months prior to the Friday of the week before
       the First IETF.

       The process officially begins with the announcement of the Chair
       of the committee.  The process officially ends when all confirmed
       candidates have been announced.

       The annual process is comprised of three major components as
       follows.

       1.  The selection and organization of the nominating committee
           members.

       2.  The selection of candidates by the nominating committee.

       3.  The confirmation of the candidates.


       There is an additional month set aside between when the annual
       process is expected to end and the term of the new candidates is
       to begin.  This time may be used during unusual circumstances to
       extend the time allocated for any of the components listed above.

   2.  The principal functions of the nominating committee are to review
       each open IESG and IAB position and to either nominate its
       incumbent or a superior candidate.

       Although there is no term limit for serving in any IESG or IAB
       position, the nominating committee may use length of service as
       one of its criteria for evaluating an incumbent.

       The nominating committee does not select the open positions to be
       reviewed; it is instructed as to which positions to review.

       The nominating committee will be given the title of the positions
       to be reviewed and a brief description of the desirable set of
       qualifications of the candidate that is nominated to fill each
       position.



Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004                [Page 5]


       Incumbents must notify the nominating committee if they wish to
       be nominated.

       The nominating committee does not confirm its candidates; it
       presents its candidates to the appropriate confirming body as
       indicated below.

       A superior candidate is one who the nominating committee believes
       would contribute in such a way as to improve or enhance the body
       to which he or she is nominated.

   3.  One-half of each of the then current IESG and IAB positions is
       selected to be reviewed each year.

       The intent of this rule to ensure the review of approximately
       one-half of each of the IESG and IAB sitting members each year.
       It is recognized that circumstances may exist that will require
       the nominating committee to review more or less than one-half of
       the current positions, e.g., if the IESG or IAB have re-organized
       prior to this process and created new positions, if there are an
       odd number of current positions, or if a member unexpectedly
       resigns.

   4.  Confirmed candidates are expected to serve at least a 2 year
       term.

       The intent of this rule is to ensure that members of the IESG and
       IAB serve the number of years that best facilitates the review of
       one-half of the members each year.

       It is consistent with this rule for the nominating committee to
       choose one or more of the currently open positions to which it
       may assign a term greater than 2 years in order to ensure the
       ideal application of this rule in the future.

       It is consistent with this rule for the nominating committee to
       choose one or more of the currently open positions that share
       responsibilities with other positions (both those being reviewed
       and those sitting) to which it may assign a term greater than 2
       years to ensure that all such members will not be reviewed at the
       same time.

       All sitting member terms end during the First IETF meeting
       corresponding to the end of the term for which they were
       confirmed.  All confirmed candidate terms begin during the First
       IETF meeting corresponding to the beginning of the term for which
       they were confirmed.  Normally, the confirmed candidate's term
       begins when the currently sitting member's term ends on the last
       day of the meeting.  A term may begin or end no sooner than the
       first day of the meeting and no later than the last day of the



Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


       meeting as determined by the mutual agreement of the currently
       sitting member and the confirmed candidate. The confirmed
       candidate's term may overlap the sitting member's term during the
       meeting as determined by their mutual agreement.

   5.  Mid-term vacancies are filled by the same rules as documented
       here with four qualifications.

       First, when there is only one official nominating committee the
       body with the mid-term vacancy relegates the responsibility to
       fill the vacancy to it.  If the mid-term vacancy occurs during
       the period of time that the term of the prior year's nominating
       committee overlaps with the term of the current year's nominating
       committee, the body with the mid-term vacancy must relegate the
       responsibility to fill the vacancy to the prior year's nominating
       committee.

       Second, if it is the case that the nominating committee is
       reconvening to fill the mid-term vacancy, then the candidate
       selection and confirmation process is expected to be completed
       within 6 weeks, with all other time periods otherwise unspecified
       prorated accordingly.

       Third, the confirming body has two weeks from the day it is
       notified of a candidate to reject the candidate, otherwise the
       candidate is assumed to have been confirmed.

       Fourth, the term of the confirmed candidate will be either:

       1.  the remainder of the term of the open position if that
           remainder is not less than one year.

       2.  the remainder of the term of the open position plus the next
           2 year term if that remainder is less than one year.


       In both cases a year is the period of time from a First IETF
       meeting to the next First IETF meeting.

   6.  All deliberations and supporting information that relates to
       specific nominees, candidates, and confirmed candidates are
       confidential.

       The nominating committee and confirming body members will be
       exposed to confidential information as a result of their
       deliberations, their interactions with those they consult, and
       from those who provide requested supporting information.  All
       members and all other participants are expected to handle this



Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


       information in a manner consistent with its sensitivity.

       It is consistent with this rule for current nominating committee
       members who have served on prior nominating committees to advise
       the current committee on deliberations and results of the prior
       committee, as necessary and appropriate.

   7.  Unless otherwise specified, the advice and consent model is used
       throughout the process.  This model is characterized as follows.

       1.  The IETF Executive Director informs the nominating committee
           of the IESG and IAB positions to be reviewed.

           The IESG and IAB are responsible for providing a list of the
           qualifications desired of the candidates selected for their
           respective open positions to the Executive Director.  The
           lists are to be provided to the nominating committee for its
           consideration.

       2.  The nominating committee selects candidates and advises each
           confirming body of its respective candidates.

       3.  The confirming bodies review their respective candidates,
           they may at their discretion communicate with the nominating
           committee, and then consent to some, all, or none of the
           candidates.

           The sitting IAB members review the IESG candidates.

           The Internet Society Board of Trustees reviews the IAB
           candidates.

           The confirming bodies conduct their review using all
           information and any means acceptable to them, including but
           not limited to the supporting information provided by the
           nominating committee, information known personally to members
           of the confirming bodies and shared within the confirming
           body, the results of interactions within the confirming
           bodies, and the confirming bodies interpretation of what is
           in the best interests of the IETF community.

           If all of the candidates are confirmed, the job of the
           nominating committee with respect to those open positions is
           complete.

           If some or none of the candidates submitted to a confirming
           body are confirmed, the confirming body should communicate
           with the nominating committee both to explain the reason why



Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


           all the candidates were not confirmed and to understand the
           nominating committee's rationale for its candidates.

           The confirming body may reject individual candidates, in
           which case the nominating committee must select alternate
           candidates for the rejected candidates.

           Any additional time required by the nominating committee
           should not exceed its maximum time allotment.

       4.  A confirming body decides whether it confirms each candidate
           using a confirmation decision rule chosen by the confirming
           body.

           If a confirming body has no specific confirmation decision
           rule, then confirming a given candidate should require at
           least one-half of the confirming body's sitting members to
           agree to that confirmation.

           The decision may be made by conducting a formal vote, by
           asserting consensus based on informal exchanges (e.g. email),
           or by any other mechanism that is used to conduct the normal
           business of the confirming body.

           Regardless of which decision rule the confirming body uses,
           any candidate that is not confirmed under that rule is
           considered to be rejected.

           The confirming body must make its decision within a
           reasonable timeframe.  The results from the confirming body
           must be reported promptly to the nominating committee.

   8.  The following rules apply to nominees who are currently sitting
       members of the IESG or IAB, and who are not sitting in an open
       position being filled by the nominating committe.

       The confirmation of a candidate to an open position does not
       automatically create a vacancy in the IESG or IAB position
       currently occupied by the candidate.  This is because an
       individual is permitted to serve in more than one role although
       oral tradition does discourage the practice. The mid-term vacancy
       can not exist until, first, the candidate formally resigns from
       the current position and, second, the body with the vacancy
       formally decides for itself that it wants the nominating
       committee to fill the mid-term vacancy.

       The resignation should be effective as of when the term of the
       new position begins.  The resignation may remain confidential to



Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


       the IAB, IESG, and nominating committee until the confirmed
       candidate is announced for the new position.

       Filling a mid-term vacancy is a separate and independent action
       from the customary action of filling open positions. In
       particular, a nominating committee must complete its job with
       respect to filling the open positions and then separately submit
       a candidate to fill a mid-term vacancy.

       It is consistent with these rules for the announcements of a
       resignation, of the existence of a mid-term vacancy, and of the
       confirmed candidates to all occur at the same time as long as the
       actual sequence of events that occurred did so in the following
       order.

       *  The nominating committee completes the advice and consent
          process for the candidate already sitting on another body.

       *  The newly confirmed candidate resigns from their current
          position.

       *  The body with the new mid-term vacancy requests that the
          nominating committee fill the position.

       *  The Executive Director of the IETF informs the nominating
          committee of the mid-term vacancy.

       *  The nominating committee acts on the request to fill the
          mid-term vacancy

   9.  All announcements must be made using at least the mechanism used
       by the IETF Secretariat for its announcements, including a notice
       on the IETF web site.

       As of the publication of this document the current mechanism is
       an email message to both the "ietf" and the "ietf-announce"
       mailing lists.

4. Nominating Committee Selection

   The following set of rules apply to the creation of the nominating
   committee and the selection of its members.

   1.   The process of selecting and organizing the members of the
        nominating committee is expected to be completed within 3
        months.

        The selection and organization process must be completed at
        least one month prior to the Third IETF.  This ensures the
        nominating committee is fully operational and available for
        interviews and consultation during the Third IETF.

   2.   The term of a nominating committee is expected to be 15 months.

        It is the intent of this rule that the end of a nominating
        committee's term overlap by approximately three months the
        beginning of the term of the next nominating committee.

        The term of a nominating committee begins when its members are
        officially announced.  The term ends at the Third IETF (not
        three meetings) after the next nominating committee's term
        begins.

        A term is expected to begin at least two months prior to the
        Third IETF to ensure the nominating committee has at least one
        month to get organized before preparing for the Third IETF.

        A nominating committee is expected to complete any
        work-in-progress before it is dissolved at the end of its term.

        During the period of time that the terms of the nominating
        committees overlap, all mid-term vacancies are to be relegated
        to the prior year's nominating committee.  The prior year's
        nominating committee has no other responsibilities during the
        overlap period.  At all times other than the overlap period
        there is exactly one official nominating committee and it is
        responsible for all mid-term vacancies.

        When the prior year's nominating committee is filling a mid-term
        vacancy during the period of time that the terms overlap, the
        nominating committees operate independently.  However, some
        coordination is needed between them.  Since the prior year's
        Chair is a non-voting advisor to the current nominating
        committee the coordination is expected to be straightforward.

   3.   The nominating committee comprises at least a Chair, 10 voting



Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


        volunteers, 2 liaisons, and an advisor.

        Any committee member may propose the addition of an advisor to
        participate in some or all of the deliberations of the
        committee.  The addition must be approved by all members of the
        committee according to its established voting mechanism.
        Advisors participate as individuals.

        Any committee member may propose the addition of a liaison from
        other unrepresented organizations to participate in some or all
        of the deliberations of the committee.  The addition must be
        approved by all members of the committee according to its
        established voting mechanism.  Liaisons participate as
        representatives of their respective organizations.

        The Chair is selected according to rules stated elsewhere in
        this document.

        The 10 voting volunteers are selected according to rules stated
        elsewhere in this document.

        The IESG and IAB liaisons are selected according to rules stated
        elsewhere in this document.

        The Chair of last year's nominating committee serves as an
        advisor according to rules stated elsewhere in this document.

        None of the Chair, liaisons, or advisors vote on the selection
        of candidates.  They do vote on all other issues before the
        committee unless otherwise specified.

   4.   The Chair of the nominating committee is responsible for
        ensuring the nominating committee completes its assigned duties
        in a timely fashion and performs in the best interests of the
        IETF community.

        The Chair must be thoroughly familiar with the rules and
        guidance indicated throughout this document.  The Chair must
        ensure the nominating committee completes its assigned duties in
        a manner that is consistent with this document.

        The Chair must attest by proclamation at a plenary session of
        the First IETF that the results of the committee represent its
        best effort and the best interests of the IETF community.

        The Chair does not vote on the selection of candidates.

   5.   The Internet Society President appoints the Chair, who must meet



Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


        the same requirements for membership in the nominating committee
        as a voting volunteer.

        The nominating committee Chair must agree to invest the time
        necessary to ensure that the nominating committee completes its
        assigned duties and to perform in the best interests of the IETF
        community in that role.

        The appointment must be completed no later than the Second IETF
        meeting to ensure it can be announced during a plenary session
        at that meeting.  The appointment must be completed as soon as
        necessary to ensure the annual process can complete at the time
        specified elsewhere in this document.

   6.   A Chair, in consultation with the Internet Society President,
        may appoint a temporary substitute.

        There are a variety of ordinary circumstances that may arise
        from time to time that could result in a Chair being unavailable
        to oversee the activities of the committee.  The Chair, in
        consultation with the Internet Society President, may appoint a
        substitute from a pool comprised of the liaisons currently
        serving on the committee and the prior year's Chair or designee.

        Any such appointment must be temporary and does not absolve the
        Chair of any or all responsibility for ensuring the nominating
        committee completes its assigned duties in a timely fashion.

   7.   Liaisons are responsible for ensuring the nominating committee
        in general and the Chair in particular execute their assigned
        duties in the best interests of the IETF community.

        Liaisons are expected to represent the views of their respective
        organizations during the deliberations of the committee.  They
        should provide information as requested or when they believe it
        would be helpful to the committee.

        Liaisons from the IESG and IAB are expected to provide
        information to the nominating committee regarding the operation,
        responsibility, and composition of their respective bodies.

        Liaisons are expected to convey questions from the committee to
        their respective organizations and responses to those questions
        to the committee, as requested by the committee.

        Liaisons from the IESG, IAB, and Internet Society Board of
        Trustees are expected to review the operation and executing
        process of the nominating committee and to report any concerns



Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


        or issues to the Chair of the nominating committee immediately.
        If they can not resolve the issue between themselves liaisons
        must report the issue to their respective bodies.  If their
        respective body agrees that there is an issue the liaison must
        report it according to the dispute resolution process stated
        elsewhere in this document.

        Liaisons from confirming bodies are expected to assist the
        committee in preparing the testimony it is required to provide
        with its candidates.

        Liaisons may have other nominating committee responsibilities as
        required by their respective organizations or requested by the
        nominating committee, except that such responsibilities may not
        conflict with any other provisions of this document.

        Liaisons do not vote on the selection of candidates.

   8.   The sitting IAB and IESG members each appoint a liaison from
        their current membership, someone who is not sitting in an open
        position, to serve on the nominating committee.

   9.   The Internet Society Board of Trustees may appoint a liaison to
        the nominating committee.

   10.  An advisor is responsible for such duties as specified by the
        invitation that resulted in the appointment.

        Advisors do not vote on the selection of candidates.

   11.  The Chair of the prior year's nominating committee serves as an
        advisor to the current committee.

        The prior year's Chair is expected to review the actions and
        activities of the current Chair and to report any concerns or
        issues to the nominating committee Chair immediately.  If they
        can not resolve the issue between themselves the prior year's
        Chair must report it according to the dispute resolution process
        stated elsewhere in this document.

        The prior year's Chair may select a designee from a pool
        composed of the voting volunteers of the prior year's committee
        and all prior Chairs if the Chair is unavailable.  If the prior
        year's Chair is unavailable or is unable or unwilling to make
        such a designation in a timely fashion, the Chair of the current
        year's committee may select a designee in consultation with the
        Internet Society President.




Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


        Selecting a prior year's committee member as the designee
        permits the experience of the prior year's deliberations to be
        readily available to the current committee.  Selecting an
        earlier prior year Chair as the designee permits the experience
        of being a Chair as well as that Chair's committee deliberations
        to be readily available to the current committee.

        All references to "prior year's Chair" in this document refer to
        the person serving in that role, whether it is the actual prior
        year's Chair or a designee.

   12.  Voting volunteers are responsible for completing the tasks of
        the nominating committee in a timely fashion.

        Each voting volunteer is expected to participate in all
        activities of the nominating committee with a level of effort
        approximately equal to all other voting volunteers.  Specific
        tasks to be completed are established and managed by the Chair
        according to rules stated elsewhere in this document.

   13.  The Chair must establish and announce milestones for the
        selection of the nominating committee members.

        There is a defined time period during which the selection
        process must be completed.  The Chair must establish a set of
        milestones which, if met in a timely fashion, will result in the
        completion of the process on time.

   14.  The Chair obtains the list of IESG and IAB positions to be
        reviewed and announces it along with a solicitation for names of
        volunteers from the IETF community willing to serve on the
        nominating committee.

        The solicitation must permit the community at least 30 days
        during which they may choose to volunteer to be selected for the
        nominating committee.

        The list of open positions is published with the solicitation to
        facilitate community members choosing between volunteering for
        an open position and volunteering for the nominating committee.

   15.  Members of the IETF community must have attended at least 3 of
        the last 5 IETF meetings in order to volunteer.

        The 5 meetings are the five most recent meetings that ended
        prior to the date on which the solicitation for nominating
        committee volunteers was submitted for distribution to the IETF
        community.



Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004               [Page 15]


        The IETF Secretariat is responsible for confirming that
        volunteers have met the attendance requirement.

        Volunteers must provide their full name, email address, and
        primary company or organization affiliation (if any) when
        volunteering.

        Volunteers are expected to be familiar with the IETF processes
        and procedures, which are readily learned by active
        participation in a working group and especially by serving as a
        document editor or working group chair.

   16.  Members of the Internet Society Board of Trustees, sitting
        members of the IAB, and sitting members of the IESG may not
        volunteer to serve on the nominating committee.

   17.  The Chair announces both the list of the pool of volunteers from
        which the 10 voting volunteers will be randomly selected and the
        method with which the selection will be completed.

        The announcement should be made at least 1 week prior to the
        date on which the random selection will occur.

        The pool of volunteers must be enumerated or otherwise indicated
        according to the needs of the selection method to be used.

        The announcement must specify the data that will be used as
        input to the selection method.  The method must depend on random
        data whose value is not known or available until the date on
        which the random selection will occur.

        It must be possible to independently verify that the selection
        method used is both fair and unbiased.  A method is fair if each
        eligible volunteer is equally likely to be selected.  A method
        is unbiased if no one can influence its outcome in favor of a
        specific outcome.

        It must be possible to repeat the selection method, either
        through iteration or by restarting in such a way as to remain
        fair and unbiased.  This is necessary to replace selected
        volunteers should they become unavailable after selection.

        The selection method must produce an ordered list of volunteers.

        One possible selection method is described in RFC2777 [1].

   18.  The Chair randomly selects the 10 voting volunteers from the
        pool of names of volunteers and announces the members of the
        nominating committee.




Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


        No more than two volunteers with the same primary affiliation
        may be selected for the nominating committee.  The Chair reviews
        the primary affiliation of each volunteer selected by the method
        in turn.  If the primary affiliation for a volunteer is the same
        as two previously selected volunteers, that volunteer is removed
        from consideration and the method is repeated to identify the
        next eligible volunteer.

        There must be at least two announcements of all members of the
        nominating committee.

        The first announcement should occur as soon after the random
        selection as is reasonable for the Chair.  The community must
        have at least 1 week during which any member may challenge the
        results of the random selection.

        The challenge must be made in writing (email is acceptable) to
        the Chair.  The Chair has 48 hours to review the challenge and
        offer a resolution to the member.  If the resolution is not
        accepted by the member, that member may report the challenge
        according to the dispute resolution process stated elsewhere in
        this document.

        If a selected volunteer, upon reading the announcement with the
        list of selected volunteers, finds that two or more other
        volunteers have the same affiliation, then the volunteer should
        notify the Chair who will determine the appropriate action.

        During at least the 1 week challenge period the Chair must
        contact each of the members and confirm their willingness and
        availability to serve.  The Chair should make every reasonable
        effort to contact each member.

        *  If the Chair is unable to contact a liaison the problem is
           referred to the respective organization to resolve.  The
           Chair should allow a reasonable amount of time for the
           organization to resolve the problem and then may proceed
           without the liaison.

        *  If the Chair is unable to contact an advisor the Chair may
           elect to proceed without the advisor, except for the prior
           year's Chair for whom the Chair must consult with the
           Internet Society President as stated elsewhere in this
           document.

        *  If the Chair is unable to contact a voting volunteer the
           Chair must repeat the random selection process in order to
           replace the unavailable volunteer.  There should be at least

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


           1 day between the announcement of the iteration and the
           selection process.


        After at least 1 week and confirming that 10 voting volunteers
        are ready to serve, the Chair makes the second announcement of
        the members of the nominating committee, which officially begins
        the term of the nominating committee.

   19.  The Chair works with the members of the committee to organize
        itself in preparation for completing its assigned duties.

        The committee has approximately one month during which it can
        self-organize.  Its responsibilities during this time include
        but are not limited to the following.

        *  Setting up a regular teleconference schedule.

        *  Setting up an internal web site.

        *  Setting up a mailing list for internal discussions.

        *  Setting up an email address for receiving community input.

        *  Establishing operational procedures.

        *  Establishing milestones in order to monitor the progress of
           the selection process.

5. Nominating Committee Operation

   The following rules apply to the operation of the nominating
   committee.  If necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation
   of each rule is included.

   The rules are organized approximately in the order in which they
   would be invoked.

   1.   All rules and special circumstances not otherwise specified are
        at the discretion of the committee.

        Exceptional circumstances will occasionally arise during the
        normal operation of the nominating committee.  This rule is
        intended to foster the continued forward progress of the
        committee.

        Any member of the committee may propose a rule for adoption by
        the committee.  The rule must be approved by all members of the
        committee according to its established voting mechanism.

        All members of the committee should consider whether the
        exception is worthy of mention in the next revision of this
        document and follow-up accordingly.

   2.   The process of selecting candidates to be confirmed by their
        respective confirming body is expected to be completed within 3
        months.

        The selection process must be completed at least two month's
        prior to the First IETF.  This ensures the nominating committee
        has sufficient time to complete the confirmation process.

   3.   The process of confirming the candidates is expected to be
        completed within 1 month.

        The confirmation process must be completed at least one month
        prior to the First IETF.

   4.   The Chair must establish for the nominating committee a set of
        milestones for the candidate selection and confirmation process.

        There is a defined time period during which the candidate
        selection and confirmation process must be completed.  The Chair
        must establish a set of milestones which, if met in a timely
        fashion, will result in the completion of the process on time.
        The Chair should allow time for iterating the activities of the
        committee if one or more candidates is not confirmed.



Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004               [Page 19]


        The Chair should ensure that all committee members are aware of
        the milestones.

   5.   The Chair must establish a voting mechanism.

        The committee must be able to objectively determine when a
        decision has been made during its deliberations.  The criteria
        for determining closure must be established and known to all
        members of the nominating committee.

   6.   At least a quorum of committee members must participate in a
        vote.

        Only voting volunteers vote on a candidate selection.  For a
        candidate selection vote a quorum is comprised of at least 7 of
        the voting volunteers.

        At all other times a quorum is present if at least 75% of the
        nominating committee members are participating.

   7.   Any member of the nominating committee may propose to the
        committee that any other member except the Chair be recalled.
        The process for recalling the Chair is defined elsewhere in this
        document.

        There are a variety of ordinary circumstances that may arise
        that could result in one or more members of the committee being
        unavailable to complete their assigned duties, for example
        health concerns, family issues, or a change of priorities at
        work.  A committee member may choose to resign for unspecified
        personal reasons.  In addition, the committee may not function
        well as a group because a member may be disruptive or otherwise
        uncooperative.

        Regardless of the circumstances, if individual committee members
        can not work out their differences between themselves, the
        entire committee may be called upon to discuss and review the
        circumstances.  If a resolution is not forthcoming a vote may be
        conducted.  A member may recalled if at least a quorum of all
        committee members agree, including the vote of the member being
        recalled.

        If a liaison member is recalled the committee must notify the
        affected organization and must allow a reasonable amount of time
        for a replacement to be identified by the organization before
        proceeding.

        If an advisor member other than the prior year's Chair is
        recalled, the committee may choose to proceed without the
        advisor.  In the case of the prior year's Chair, the Internet



Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


        Society President must be notified and the current Chair must be
        allowed a reasonable amount of time to consult with the Internet
        Society President to identify a replacement before proceeding.

        If a voting volunteer member is recalled the committee may
        choose to proceed with only 9 voting volunteers at its own
        discretion.  In all other cases the Chair must repeat the random
        selection process including an announcement of the iteration
        prior to the actual selection as stated elsewhere in this
        document.

        A change in the primary affiliation of a voting volunteer during
        the term of the nominating committee is not a cause to request
        the recall of that volunteer, even if the change would result in
        more than two voting volunteers with the same affiliation.

   8.   Only the prior year's Chair may request the recall of the
        current Chair.

        It is the responsibility of the prior year's Chair to ensure the
        current Chair completes the assigned tasks in a manner
        consistent with this document and in the best interests of the
        IETF community.

        Any member of the committee who has an issue or concern
        regarding the Chair should report it to the prior year's Chair
        immediately.  The prior year's Chair is expected to report it to
        the Chair immediately.  If they can not resolve the issue
        between themselves the prior year's Chair must report it
        according to the dispute resolution process stated elsewhere in
        this document.

   9.   All members of the nominating committee may participate in all
        deliberations.

        The emphasis of this rule is that no member can be explicitly
        excluded from any deliberation.  However, a member may
        individually choose not to participate in a deliberation.

   10.  The Chair announces the open positions to be reviewed and the
        call for nominees.

        The call for nominees must include a request for comments
        regarding the past performance of incumbents, which will be
        considered during the deliberations of the nominating committee.

        The call must request that a nomination include a valid, working
        email address, a telephone number, or both for the nominee.  The



Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004               [Page 21]

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


        nomination must include the set of skills or expertise the
        nominator believes the nominee has that would be desirable.

   11.  Any member of the IETF community may nominate any member of the
        IETF community for any open position, whose eligibility to serve
        will be confirmed by the nominating committee.

        A self-nomination is permitted.

        Nominating committee members are not eligible to be considered
        for filling any open position by the nominating committee on
        which they serve.  They become ineligible as soon as the term of
        the nominating committee on which they serve officially begins.
        They remain ineligible for the duration of that nominating
        committee's term.

        Although each nominating committee's term overlaps with the
        following nominating committee's term, nominating committee
        members are eligible for nomination by the following committee
        if not otherwise disqualified.

        Members of the IETF community who were recalled from any IESG or
        IAB position during the previous two years are not eligible to
        be considered for filling any open position.

   12.  The nominating committee selects candidates based on its
        understanding of the IETF community's consensus of the
        qualifications required to fill the open positions.

        The intent of this rule is to ensure that the nominating
        committee consults with a broad base of the IETF community for
        input to its deliberations.  In particular, the nominating
        committee must determine if the desired qualifications for the
        open positions matches its understanding of the qualifications
        desired by the IETF community.

        The consultations are permitted to include names of nominees, if
        all parties to the consultation agree to observe the same
        confidentiality rules as the nominating committee itself.

        A broad base of the community should include the existing
        members of the IAB and IESG, especially sitting members who
        share responsibilities with open positions, e.g., co-Area
        Directors.

        Only voting volunteer members vote to select candidates.

   13.  Nominees should be advised that they are being considered and



Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


        must consent to their nomination prior to being chosen as
        candidates.

        Although the nominating committee will make every reasonable
        effort to contact and to remain in contact with nominees, any
        nominee whose contact information changes during the process and
        who wishes to still be considered should inform the nominating
        committee of the changes.

        A nominee's consent must be written (email is acceptable) and
        must include a commitment to provide the resources necessary to
        fill the open position and an assurance that the nominee will
        perform the duties of the position for which they are being
        considered in the best interests of the IETF community.

        Consenting to a nomination must occur prior to a nominee being a
        candidate and may occur as soon after the nomination as needed
        by the nominating committee.

        Consenting to a nomination must not imply the nominee will be a
        candidate.

        The nominating committee should help nominees provide
        justification to their employers.

   14.  The nominating committee advises the confirming bodies of their
        candidates, specifying a single candidate for each open position
        and testifying as to how each candidate meets the qualifications
        of an open position.

        For each candidate, the testimony must include a brief statement
        of the qualifications for the position that is being filled,
        which may be exactly the qualifications that were requested.  If
        the qualifications differ from the desired qualifications
        originally requested a brief statement explaining the difference
        must be included.

        The testimony may include either or both of a brief resume of
        the candidate and a brief summary of the deliberations of the
        nominating committee.

   15.  Confirmed candidates must consent to their confirmation and
        rejected candidates and nominees must be notified before
        confirmed candidates are announced.

        It is not necessary to notify and get consent from all confirmed
        candidates together.

        A nominee may not know they were a candidate. This permits a
        candidate to be rejected by a confirming body without the
        nominee knowing about the rejection.

        Rejected nominees, who consented to their nomination, and
        rejected candidates must be notified prior to announcing the
        confirmed candidates.

        It is not necessary to announce all confirmed candidates
        together.

        The nominating committee must ensure that all confirmed
        candidates are prepared to serve prior to announcing their
        confirmation.

   16.  The nominating committee should archive the information it has
        collected or produced for a period of time not to exceed its
        term.

        The purpose of the archive is to assist the nominating committee
        should it be necessary for it to fill a mid-term vacancy.

        The existence of an archive, how it is implemented, and what
        information to archive is at the discretion of the committee.
        The decision must be approved by a quorum of the voting
        volunteer members.

        The implementation of the archive should make every reasonable
        effort to ensure that the confidentiality of the information it
        contains is maintained.

6. Dispute Resolution Process

   The dispute resolution process described here is to be used as
   indicated elsewhere in this document.  Its applicability in other
   circumstances is beyond the scope of this document.

   The nominating committee operates under a strict rule of
   confidentiality.  For this reason when process issues arise it is
   best to make every reasonable effort to resolve them within the
   committee. However, when circumstances do not permit this or no
   resolution is forthcoming, the process described here is to be used.

   The following rules apply to the process.

   1.  The results of this process are final and binding.  There is no
       appeal.

   2.  The process begins with the submission of a request as described
       below to the Internet Society President.

   3.  As soon as the process begins, the nominating committee may
       continue those activities that are unrelated to the issue to be
       resolved except that it must not submit any candidates to a
       confirming body until the issue is resolved.

   4.  All parties to the process are subject to the same
       confidentiality rules as each member of the nominating committee.

   5.  The process should be completed within two weeks.

   The process is as follows.

   1.  The party seeking resolution submits a written request (email is
       acceptable) to the Internet Society President detailing the issue
       to be resolved.

   2.  The Internet Society President appoints an arbiter to investigate
       and resolve the issue.  A self-appointment is permitted.

   3.  The arbiter investigates the issue making every reasonable effort
       to understand both sides of the issue.  Since the arbiter is
       subject to the same confidentiality obligations as all nominating
       committee members, all members are expect to cooperate fully with
       the arbiter and to provide all relevant information to the
       arbiter for review.

   4.  After consultation with the two principal parties to the issue,
       the arbiter decides a resolution.  Whatever actions are necessary



Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004               [Page 25]

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


       to execute the resolution are immediately begun and completed as
       quickly as possible.

   5.  The arbiter summarizes the issue, the resolution, and the
       rationale for the resolution for the Internet Society President.

   6.  In consultation with the Internet Society President, the arbiter
       prepares a report of the dispute and its resolution.  The report
       should include all information that in the judgement of the
       arbiter does not violate the confidentiality requirements of the
       nominating committee.

   7.  The Chair includes the dispute report when reporting on the
       activities of the nominating committee to the IETF community.

7. Member Recall

   The following rules apply to the recall process.  If necessary, a
   paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is included.

   1.  At any time, at least 20 members of the IETF community, who are
       qualified to be voting members of a nominating committee, may
       request by signed petition (email is acceptable) to the Internet
       Society President the recall of any sitting IAB or IESG member.

       All individual and collective qualifications of nominating
       committee eligibility are applicable, including that no more than
       two signatories may have the same primary affiliation.

       Each signature must include a full name, email address, and
       primary company or organization affiliation.

       The petition must include a statement of justification for the
       recall and all relevant and appropriate supporting documentation.

       The petition and its signatories must be announced to the IETF
       community.

   2.  Internet Society President shall appoint a Recall Committee
       Chair.

       The Internet Society President must not evaluate the recall
       request.  It is explicitly the responsibility of the IETF
       community to evaluate the behavior of its leaders.

   3.  The recall committee is created according to the same rules as is
       the nominating committee with the qualifications that both the
       person being investigated and the parties requesting the recall
       must not be a member of the recall committee in any capacity.

   4.  The recall committee operates according to the same rules as the
       nominating committee with the qualification that there is no
       confirmation process.

   5.  The recall committee investigates the circumstances of the
       justification for the recall and votes on its findings.

       The investigation must include at least both an opportunity for
       the member being recalled to present a written statement and
       consultation with third parties.

   6.  A 3/4 majority of the members who vote on the question is
       required for a recall.

   7.  If a sitting member is recalled the open position is to be filled
       according to the mid-term vacancy rules.

8. Changes From RFC2727

   This section describes the substantive changes from RFC2727, listed
   approximately in the order in which they appear in the document.

   1.   A section with definitions for words and phrases used throughout
        the document was inserted.

   2.   The role of term limits as a selection criterion was clarified.

   3.   The NOMCOM must now be provided with a brief description of the
        desirable set of qualifications for the candidate to be
        nominated for each position.

   4.   Because of the overlapping terms of successive nominating
        committees, the specific committee responsible for a mid-term
        vacancy was specified.

   5.   The characterization of the advice and consent model was revised
        to permit the confirming body to communicate with the nominating
        committee during the approval process.

   6.   A general rule was added to define that all announcements are
        made with the usual IETF Secretariat mechanism.

   7.   Details regarding the expected timeline of the selection and
        operation of the committee were made even more explicit.  An
        Appendix was added that captures all the details for the
        convenience of the reader.

   8.   The term of the nominating committee was extended to
        approximately 15 months such that it explicitly overlaps by
        approximately 3 months the next year's nominating committee's
        term.

   9.   The terms voting member and non-voting member were replaced by
        voting volunteers, liaisons, and advisors.  All members vote at
        all times except that the only voting volunteers vote on a
        candidate selection.

   10.  The responsibilities of the Chair, liaisons, advisors, and
        voting volunteers is now explicitly stated.

   11.  Processes for recalling members of the committee were added.

   12.  Liaisons and advisors are no longer required to meet the usual
        requirements for nominating committee membership.




Galvin                  Expires February 3, 2004               [Page 29]

Internet-Draft           IAB and IESG Selection              August 2003


   13.  The Internet Society Board of Trustees may appoint a non-voting
        liaison.

   14.  The eligibility qualifications for the nominating committee was
        changed to require attendance at 3 out of 5 of the last five
        meetings, to require volunteers to submit identifying contact
        information, and to request that volunteers be familiar with
        IETF processes and procedures.

   15.  Some additional clarification was added to the method used to
        select volunteers.

   16.  The process for selecting the 10 voting volunteers had several
        clarifications and additional requirements added, including a
        challenge process and the requirement to disallow more than two
        volunteers with the same primary affiliation.

   17.  Nominations for open positions should include both contact
        information and a description of the skills or expertise the
        nominator believes the nominee possesses.

   18.  Nominees are requested to keep the nominating committee informed
        of changes in their contact information.  Editorially, the
        distinction between a nominee and candidate was emphasized.

   19.  A description of a testimony to be provided with each candidate
        to a confirming body by the nominating committee is specified.

   20.  The rules regarding the announcement of confirmed candidates
        were substantially rewritten to make it easier to understand.

   21.  The nominating committee is permitted to keep an archive for the
        duration of its term of the information it collects and produces
        for its own internal use.

   22.  A dispute resolution process for addressing process concerns was
        added.

   23.  The process for recalling a sitting member of the IAB and IESG
        requires at least 20 eligible members of the IETF community to
        sign a petition requesting the recall.

   24.  The section on Security Considerations was expanded.

   25.  Appendix A, Oral Tradition, has been added.

   26.  Appendix B, Nominating Committee Timeline, has been added as a
        convenience to the reader.

9. Acknowledgements

   There have been a number of people involved with the development of
   this document over the years as it has progressed from RFC2027
   through RFC2282 and RFC2727 to its current version.

   A great deal of credit goes to the first three Nominating Committee
   Chairs:

      1993 - Jeff Case

      1994 - Fred Baker

      1995 - John Curran

   who had the pleasure of operating without the benefit of a documented
   process.  It was their fine work and oral tradition that became the
   first version of this document.

   Of course we can not overlook the bug discovery burden that each of
   the Chairs since the first publication have had to endure:

      1996 - Guy Almes

      1997 - Geoff Huston

      1998 - Mike St. Johns

      1999 - Donald Eastlake

      2000 - Avri Doria

      2001 - Bernard Adoba

      2002 - Ted T'so

      2003 - Phil Roberts

   The bulk of the early credit goes to the members of the POISSON
   Working Group, previously the POISED Working Group.  The prose here
   would not be what it is were it not for the attentive and insightful
   review of its members.  Specific acknowledgement must be extended to
   Scott Bradner and John Klensin, who consistently contributed to the
   improvement of the first three versions of this document.

   In January 2002 a new working group was formed, the Nominating
   Committee Working Group (nomcom), to revise the RFC2727 version.
   This working group was guided by the efforts of a design team whose

   members were as follows:

      Bernard Adoba

10. Security Considerations

   Any selection, confirmation, or recall process necessarily involves
   investigation into the qualifications and activities of prospective
   candidates.  The investigation may reveal confidential or otherwise
   private information about candidates to those participating in the
   process.  Each person who participates in any aspect of the process
   must maintain the confidentiality of any and all information not
   explicitly identified as suitable for public dissemination.

   When the nominating committee decides it is necessary to share
   confidential or otherwise private information with others, the
   dissemination must be minimal and must include a prior commitment
   from all persons consulted to observe the same confidentiality rules
   as the nominating committee itself.

Appendix A. Oral Tradition

   Over the years various nominating committees have learned through
   oral tradition passed on by liaisons that there are certain
   consistencies in the process and information considered during
   deliberations.  Some items from that oral tradition are collected
   here to facilitate its consideration by future nominating committees.

   1.  It has been found that experience as an IETF Working Group Chair
       or an IRTF Research Group Chair is helpful in giving a nominee
       experience of what the job of an Area Director involves.  It is
       also helps a nominating committee judge the technical, people,
       and process management skills of the nominee.

   2.  No person should serve on both the IESG and the IAB concurrently,
       except the IETF Chair who serves on both bodies by definition.

   3.  The strength of the IAB is found in part in the balance of the
       demographics of its members (e.g., national distribution, years
       of experience, gender, etc.), the combined skill set of its
       members, and the combined sectors (e.g., industry, academia,
       etc.) represented by its members.

   4.  There are no term limits explicitly because the issue of
       continuity versus turnover should be evaluated each year
       according to the expectations of the IETF community, as it is
       understood by each nominating committee.

   5.  The number of nominating committee members with the same primary
       affiliation is limited in order to avoid the appearance of
       improper bias in choosing the leadership of the IETF.  Rather
       than defining precise rules for how to define "affiliation," the
       IETF community depends on the honor and integrity of the
       participants to make the process work.

Appendix B. Nominating Committee Timeline

   This appendix is included for the convenience of the reader and is
   not to be interpreted as the definitive timeline.  It is intended to
   capture the detail described elsewhere in this document in one place.
   Although every effort has been made to ensure the description here is
   consistent with the description elsewhere, if there are any conflicts
   the definitive rule is the one in the main body of this document.

   The only absolute in the timeline rules for the annual process is
   that it must be completed by the First IETF of the year after the
   nominating committee begins its term.  This is supported by the fact
   that the confirmed candidate terms begin during the week of the First
   IETF.

   The overall annual process is designed to be completed in 7 months.
   It is expected to start 8 months prior to the First IETF.  The 7
   months is split between three major components of the process as
   follows.

   1.  First is the selection and organization of the committee members.
       Three months are allotted for this process.

   2.  Second is the selection of the candidates by the nominating
       committee.  Three months are allotted for this process.

   3.  Third is the confirmation of the candidates by their respective
       confirming bodies.  One month is allotted for this process

   The following figure captures the details of the milestones within
   each component.  For illustrative purposes the figure presumes the
   Friday before the First IETF is March 1.

   0. BEGIN 8 Months Prior to First IETF (approx. July 1); Internet
      Society President appoints the Chair.  The appointment must be
      done no later than the Second IETF or 8 months prior to the First
      IETF, whichever comes first.  The Chair must be announced and
      recognized during a plenary session of the Second IETF.

   1. The Chair establishes and announces milestones to ensure the
      timely selection of the nominating committee members.

   2. The Chair contacts the IESG, IAB, and Internet Society Board of
      Trustees and requests a liaison.  The Chair contacts the prior
      year's Chair and requests an advisor.  The Chair obtains the list
      of IESG and IAB open positions and descriptions from the IETF
      Executive Director.

   3. The Chair announces the solicitation for voting volunteer members
      that must remain open for at least 30 days.  The announcement must
      be done no later than 7 months and 2 weeks prior to the First IETF
      (approx. July 15).

   4. After the solicitation closes the Chair announces the pool of
      volunteers and the date of the random selection, which must be at
      least 1 week in the future.  The announcement must be done no
      later than 6 months and 2 weeks prior to the First IETF
      (approx. August 15).

   5. On the appointed day the random selection occurs and the Chair
      announces the members of the committee and the 1 week challenge
      period.  The announcement must be done no later than 6 months and
      1 week prior to the First IETF (approx. August 22).

   6. During the challenge period the Chair contacts each of the
      committee members and confirms their availability to participate.

   7. After the challenge period closes the Chair announces the members of
      the committee and its term begins.  The announcement must be done no
      later than 6 months prior to the First IETF (approx. September 1).

   8. The committee has one month during which it is to self-organize in
      preparation for completing its assigned duties.  This must be done no
      later than 5 months prior to the First IETF (approx. October 1).

   9. END the Committee Member Selection Process; BEGIN the Selection of
      Candidates; Time is at least 5 months prior to the First IETF
     (approx. October 1).

   10. The Chair establishes and announces the milestones to ensure the
       timely selection of the candidates, including a call for
       nominations for the open positions.  The announcement must be done
       no later than 5 months prior to the First IETF (approx. October
       1).

   11. Over the next 3 months the nominating committee collects input
       and deliberates.  It should plan to conduct interviews and other
       consultations during the Third IETF.  The committee must complete
       its candidate selection no later than 2 months prior to the First
       IETF (approx. January 1).

   12. END the Selection of Candidates; BEGIN the Confirmation of
       Candidates; Time is at least 2 months prior to the First IETF
       (approx. January 1);

   13. The committee presents its candidates to their respective confirming

       bodies.  The presentation must be done no later than 2 months prior
       to the First IETF (approx. January 1).

   14. The confirming bodies have 1 month to deliberate and, in
       communication with the nominating committee, accept or reject
       candidates.

   15. The Chair announces the confirmed candidates.  The announcement
       must be done no later than 1 month prior to the First IETF
