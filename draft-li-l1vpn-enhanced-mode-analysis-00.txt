1. Introduction 

   In [L1VPN-FRMWK] and [L1VPN-APPL], the signaling and routing service 
   model (Enhanced Mode) is introduced for Layer One Virtual Private 
   Networks (L1VPNs). In this service model, the interface between 
   Provider Edge and Customer Edge nodes (the PE-CE interface) exchanges 
   not only signaling information as in the Basic Mode, but also some

   limited routing information. Four sub-models are described to 
   represent the network depending on how customers perceive the 
   provider network through signaling and routing.  

   The four sub-models of the signaling and routing service model are 
   the Overlay Extension service model, the Virtual Node service model, 
   the Virtual Link service model, and the Per-VPN Peer service model. 
   It would be costly for a device to support all four sub-models, so it 
   is desirable to limit the choice of which sub-model should be 
   supported by an implementation. The motivation of this document is to 
   discuss these sub-models, and make it easy to make the decision.  

   Each sub-model is evaluated from different points of view, such as 
   Topology Confidentiality, scalability, and reliability. The 
   requirements on GMPLS to support each sub-model of L1VPN enhanced 
   mode are also discussed. 

2. Enhanced Mode Overview 

   As defined in [L1VPN-FRMWK], the Enhanced Mode has four sub-models 
   which are the Overlay Extension service model, the Virtual Node 
   service model, the Virtual Link service model, the Per-VPN Peer 
   service model.  

   In the Overlay Extension service model, the routing information a CE 
   can receive from a PE is limited to information about the list of CE-
   PE TE link addresses, and may also include additional information 
   concerning these TE links. The information includes Customer Port 
   Identifier (CPI) and the per-VPN Provider Port Identifier (VPN-PPI) 
   of the remote CE-PE TE links in a VPN, and may contain TE attributes 
   such as the switching type and encoding type of these TE links. 

   In the Virtual Node service model, the VPN backbone is represented as 
   a virtual node, and the customer perceives the VPN backbone as one 
   signal node which can be entered and exited by LSPs over CE-PE links 
   in a specific VPN. A CE receives routing information about remote CE-
   PE links and the customer network (i.e., remote customer sites which 
   may include TE attribute in customer network). 

   In the Virtual Link service model, more routing information is leaked 
   from PE to CE compared with the Virtual Node service mode. This 
   information includes CE-PE links and remote customer sites as in the 
   Virtual Node service model. In addition, the routing information also 
   includes virtual TE links interconnecting PEs in a specific VPN. 

   Due to the routing information exchanged between CE and PE, the Per-
   VPN Peer service model is the most complicated one of the four sub-

   models. Besides the routing information of CE-PE links and remote 
   customer sites, the PE advertises routing information about the 
   partitioned portions of the provider network to the CEs. Such 
   information contains at least one virtual P node which represents one 
   real P-node or a set of P-nodes, and virtual links connecting PEs to 
   the virtual P-nodes. 

3. Analysis of the Sub-models 

   Each sub-model is evaluated from the following three aspects: 
   Topology Confidentiality, scalability, and reliability. An additional 
   section presents any other considerations such as manageability and 
   optimality. 

   Topology Confidentiality means whether a sub-model is secure from the 
   service provider's point of view. Namely, the more details of the 
   provider network are exposed to customer the more dangerous (not 
   secure) it will be.  

   Scalability means whether the solution for one sub-model in the 
   single domain scenario can be applied to multi-domain/AS scenario 
   without any changes or with few changes. The size of the routing 
   information is another scaling issue which also should be considered 
   in each sub-model. 

   Reliability represents how each sub-model can improve the 
   availability of the L1VPN service by using the routing information 
   which CE receives from PE. 

3.1. Overlay Extension Service Sub-Model 

3.1.1. Topology Confidentiality 

   The Overlay Extension service sub-model is the simplest of the four 
   sub-models. The provider network is a black box to the CE, and the CE 
   only receives CE-PE link information from the PE. From the service 
   provider's perspective, this model is the most secure model of the 
   four sub-models because only the VPN-PPI of the PE port associated 
   with each CE in a VPN is disclosed to the customer. Thanks to the 
   character of the VPN-PPI, the CE really knows nothing about provider 
   network. The routing information of provider network is not disclosed 
   to CE. 

3.1.2. Scalability 

   In the Overlay Extension service model, because no provider network 
   routing information is leaked to the customer, whether the VPN 
 
 
Li                       Expires April 2007                   [Page 4] 

draft-li-l1vpn-enhanced-mode-analysis-00.txt              October 2006 
    

   backbone is composed of a single area, multiple areas, or multiple 
   ASs has no impact on the protocol solutions. Consider this aspect, 
   the scalability of this service sub-model is the best of the four 
   sub-models. 

   In this service model, no provider network routing information is 
   leaked to CEs, only CE-PE TE link routing information is carried 
   through the backbone. The size of such routing information is 
   relatively small, but if the customers need to form routing adjacency 
   between CEs over CE-CE connections in order to exchange customer site 
   routing information, it may cause up to N-square routing adjacencies 
   between CEs (if a full mesh was aimed at). So in this situation, 
   scalability may become an issue. 

3.1.3. Reliability 

   The remote CE-PE TE link information available in this sub-model can 
   help the ingress CE judge whether the remote CE-PE link has enough 
   resources or whether the encoding type matches the local CE-PE link, 
   etc. Also, this information can help in making the choice of route 
   when the remote CE can be reached through more than one remote PE. 

   On the other hand, because the routing information about the customer 
   sites is not exchanged between CEs, the LSPs between two customer 
   devices must be established as in inter-domain context. Thus, in the 
   event of the failure of an LSP connecting two customer devices, the 
   failed LSP sould be rerouted as in case of inter-domain recovery. 

3.1.4. Other Issues 

   This service sub-model allows carriers to keep a tight control over 
   their network and to give to the client the minimum amount of 
   information they need to take benefit from the L1VPN service. 
   Consequently, clients do not have a detailed view on the way the 
   backbone routing is done, as it is completely devoted to carriers and 
   is part of the service provided.  

3.2. Virtual Node Service Sub-Model 

3.2.1. Topology Confidentiality 

   As for the Virtual Node service sub-model, the provider network is 
   represented to the CE as a single node. This kind of abstraction 
   makes the provider network relatively secure, because the address of 
   the virtual node disclosed to CE can be set to a value having no 
   relationship to the address space of the provider network.

draft-li-l1vpn-enhanced-mode-analysis-00.txt              October 2006 
    

3.2.2. Scalability 

   How the VPN backbone routing information is represented in a single 
   domain/AS and in multi-domain/AS network may impact the solution 
   details. Thus, in terms of scalability, under this circumstance the 
   Virtual Node service sub-model may not be as good as the Overlay 
   Extension service sub-model. 

   Besides the CE-PE TE link information, the remote customer sites 
   routing information is carried across the backbone. Considering large 
   quantity of remote customer sites information, scalability may become 
   an issue in this service model, and solution should be carefully 
   considered to avoid overload of the core routing protocol. In this 
   service model, the N-square routing adjacency problem mentioned in 
   Overlay Extension sub-model can be avoided because CE receives remote 
   customer sites routing information from PE. 

3.2.3. Reliability 

   Compared with the Overlay Extension service sub-model, the benefit of 
   using the Virtual Node service sub-model is that C-to-C LSPs can be 
   established from the head-end C because the customer sites' routing 
   information is available to all CEs in a specific VPN. Hence, in the 
   event of the failure of an LSP connecting two C-nodes, the failed LSP 
   can be rerouted automatically from the C-node in an easier way than 
   in the overlay model, where inter-domain recovery is required to 
   handled failure in any location. 

3.2.4. Other Issues 

   If a dedicated data plane within the core network is used for a VPN, 
   the Virtual Node service sub-model does not give a detailed view on 
   the actual topology because the whole VPN backbone is represented as 
   a virtual node. When the controller on a C-node or a CE performs a 
   path computation, it will treat the abstract Virtual Node just as any 
   other vertex in the VPN TE topology. This makes such requirement as 
   monitoring alarm and performance of the dedicated resources hard. 
   Further, like in the Overlay Extension sub-model, the customer 
   network cannot exert any influence over the path of the VPN 
   connection through the core network. 

   On the other hand, in a virtual node abstraction, the path computing 
   engine will take it for granted the virtual node can provide an 
   internal path of the required quality between any pair of access 
   ports. But this is not always true since the abstraction may hide 
   limited connectivity within the network. Hence, in a virtual node 
   abstraction it may be necessary to supply additional routing

draft-li-l1vpn-enhanced-mode-analysis-00.txt              October 2006 
    

   information in the form of the constraint of internal connectivity 
   between any pair access ports. 

   In the context of the Virtual Node service sub-model, the customer 
   assumes connectivity between any pair of PE ports in a specific VPN. 
   But the connectivity may not exist, so in the context of a VPN, 
   between any pair of PE-CE links, by providing the constrained routing 
   information of the internal connectivity, this problem could be 
   solved.  

   However, the customer sites are typically connected by a single VPN 
   service provider, and each customer site can only access a limited 
   set of PEs. Further, the provider usually commits to provide VPN 
   connectivity so the customer may be right to assume the connectivity 
   of the virtual node. 

3.3. Virtual Link Service Sub-Model 

3.3.1. Topology Confidentiality 

   As described in section 2, in the Virtual Link service sub-model, the 
   routing information of the provider network is provided to the 
   customer as a set of virtual links. In order to disclose such 
   information to a CE, a PE needs to advertise the virtual links 
   connecting it with other PEs. Thus, the addresses of the virtual 
   links must be visible to customer. From the provider's point of view, 
   exposing the real addresses of PEs connected by virtual link reveals 
   some information about the provider's network. In this situation, 
   technique such as address translation may be needed to keep the 
   secret of the provider network. But this definitely depends on the 
   trust relationship between a customer and a provider. 

3.3.2. Scalability 

   In the Virtual Link service sub-model, the scalability may become an 
   issue. Consider the situation where the VPN backbone is composed of 
   multiple domains or ASes; in this case, the abstraction of topology 
   into a virtual link may differ from the abstraction in a single 
   domain. This may require different routing and signaling protocol 
   solutions. 

   The scalability of the backbone routing protocol should be carefully 
   considered as described in the Virtual Node sub-model. At the same 
   time, when the topology of a specific VPN is full-mesh, in the data 
   plane of this VPN, a logical full-mesh topology comprised by virtual 
   links among the corresponding PEs is needed. Thus, the so called N-

 
 
Li                       Expires April 2007                   [Page 7] 

draft-li-l1vpn-enhanced-mode-analysis-00.txt              October 2006 
    

   square problem may arise when PE advertising the provider network 
   routing information to CEs. 

3.3.3. Reliability 

   Same as the Virtual Node service sub-model, in Virtual Link service 
   sub-model the reliability of the C-to-C LSP can be improved because 
   the customer knows some routing information of the provider network.  

3.3.4. Other Issues 

   The Virtual Link service sub-model is suitable for a dedicated data 
   plane. Depending on the virtual link TE information received, the CE 
   might control in some way how the L1VPN connection traverses the VPN 
   backbone. Also, the customer may monitor the status of the virtual 
   links in this service sub-model. In this service sub-model each PE is 
   viewed by a CE as a separate node when computing path, so the problem 
   that the internal connectivity constraint of the Virtual Node service 
   sub-model is invisible to CEs (discussed above for Virtual Node 
   service model) is more limited in the Virtual Link service sub-model. 
   Nevertheless, some constraints remain when resources towards 
   different PEs are shared. 

3.4. Per-VPN Peer Service Sub-Model 

3.4.1. Topology Confidentiality 

   From the provider's perspective, this service sub-model is the most 
   open of the four sub-models because the largest amount of routing 
   information is advertised to the customer. To keep this service model 
   in a secure mode (i.e., to keep the real addresses of PE and P-nodes 
   invisible to the CE), techniques such as address translation may be 
   required so that the addresses of virtual P-nodes and PEs disclosed 
   to customer have no relationship with the provider network address 
   realm. Again, this definitely depends on the trust relationship 
   between a customer and a provider. 

3.4.2. Scalability 

   Scalability must be carefully considered if this service sub-model is 
   deployed. Because the routing information represented in a single 
   domain may differ from that in multi-domain/AS networks, different 
   solution details may be required. 

   In this service model, the scalability of the backbone routing 
   protocol should be carefully considered as described in the Virtual 
   Node sub-model. As far as the service provider network routing 
 
 
Li                       Expires April 2007                   [Page 8] 

draft-li-l1vpn-enhanced-mode-analysis-00.txt              October 2006 
    

   information is concerned, the N-square issue discussed in Virtual 
   Link service model may not exist in this service model, but the 
   virtual P nodes should be carefully designed so that the routing 
   information propagated to CEs would be more scalable. 

3.4.3. Reliability 

   Depending on the provider network routing information received from a 
   PE, customers can have a relatively strong influence on the resources 
   dedicated to them. For example, a customer can set up diverse paths 
   which traverse different P-nodes, so that there will be less chance 
   of both paths failing at the same time. 

3.4.4. Other Issues 

   The Per-VPN Peer service sub-model is suitable for a dedicated data 
   plane just as is the Virtual Link service sub-model. But compared 
   with the Virtual Link service sub-model, the provider network exposes 
   more routing information to the customer. By using the routing 
   information about the VPN backbone, customers can have finer control 
   of the resources dedicated to them and can have more visibility of 
   the network resources in cases such as alarm monitoring, performance 
   collection, and path computation, etc.  

4. Requirements for GMPLS 

   The functional requirements such as auto-discovery, signaling, and 
   resource management play important roles in the implementation of 
   L1VPN. [L1VPN-BM] describes the possible methods which may be used to 
   implement these functional requirements in the Basic Mode. This 
   section analyzes the application of the functional requirements in 
   each signaling and routing service sub-models, and analyzes the 
   impact may have on a GMPLS-enabled network. 

4.1. Overlay Extension Service Sub-Model 

   Overlay Extension service sub-model is like the Overlay service model 
   (Basic Mode), but routing information about CE-PE TE link attributes 
   is also exchanged between CE and PE. Routing protocol-based auto-
   discovery mechanisms are described in [L1VPN-BGP] and [L1VPN-OSPF], 
   and other mechanism such as Directory Server based auto-discovery 
   have also been discussed. In the Overlay Extension service sub-model, 
   routing extensions are required to describe the CE-PE TE link 
   information, and the mechanisms described for auto-discovery can 
   easily be used to satisfy the routing requirements of this sub-model.

draft-li-l1vpn-enhanced-mode-analysis-00.txt              October 2006 
    

   In Overlay Extension service sub-model, any routing protocols can be 
   chosen between CEs. 

   As far as signaling is concerned, the Overlay Extension service sub-
   model is identical to the Basic Mode Overlay service model, and 
   Shuffling or Nesting/Stitching described in [L1VPN-BM] can be used. 

   The Overlay Extension service model is suitable for a shared or 
   dedicated data plane. With a shared data plane a resource management 
   function is not necessary, but with a dedicated data plane a resource 
   management function is required to allocate provider network link 
   resources to a specific VPN or to a specific set of VPNs. The method 
   of allocation of link resources may be through manual configuration 
   or signaling. From the provider's point of view, manual configuration 
   may be time consuming, error-prone, and means high operational 
   expenditure. So if the link resources can be allocated in an 
   automatic way (for example, using signaling), it may help providers 
   to reduce their operational costs. 

4.2. Virtual Node Service Sub-Model 

   In the Virtual Node service sub-model the provider network is 
   presented as a virtual node to the customer. The routing information 
   about CE-PE TE link attributes and customer site routing information 
   is advertised from PE to CE. Routing protocols can be extended to 
   support CE-PE TE link information advertisement. 

   Because the customer site routing information is exchanged between CE 
   and PE, the CE-PE routing protocol is restricted to the one that the 
   provider network supports. 

   The above mentioned core routing techniques can be extended to 
   exchange customer site routing information, but considering the large 
   quantity of customer site information the core routing protocols may 
   be overloaded especially when the TE routing information of customer 
   sites is also exchanged. Under such circumstances an LSP (which may 
   be an LSP established on Layer 3) may be established between PE sites 
   to carry the customer site TE routing protocol information exchanges 
   across the provider network. Such LSPs can be automatically 
   established as part of the auto-dsicovery process and can be used to 
   provide control plane connectivity between CEs. This approach may 
   also be applied to the Virtual Link and Per-VPN Peer service sub-
   models. 

   A shared or dedicated data plane can be deployed in the Virtual Node 
   service sub-model. At the same time, manual or automatic resource

   management methods described in section 4.1 can be used to achieve 
   the requirement. 

   Shuffling or Nesting/Stitching described in [L1VPN-BM] can be used to 
   achieve the Virtual Node service sub-model. 

4.3. Virtual Link Service Sub-Model 

   In the Virtual Link service sub-model, virtual links are constructed 
   between PEs. The CE receives information about the CE-PE TE links, 
   customer site routing information, and information about the virtual 
   links between PEs. 

   Same as the Virtual Node service sub-model, the CE-PE routing 
   protocol is restricted to the one that the provider network supports. 

   To keep the provider network secure, the virtual links disclosed to 
   the CE should not contain the real address within the provider 
   network, so a technique to hide them is needed in this case. To be 
   more precise, when advertising virtual link information to the CE, 
   the addresses of PEs interconnected by the virtual links may be 
   translated into private addresses or the virtualization process 
   should be able to turn a set of actual addresses to a (possibly 
   smaller) set of virtual address. 

4.4. Per-VPN Peer Service Sub-Model 

   The Per-VPN Peer service sub-model is more complex than the Virtual 
   Link service sub-model. Besides receiving information about CE-PE TE 
   links and customer site routing information, the CE receives abstract 
   VPN backbone routing information advertised from PE. The abstract VPN 
   backbone routing information is the partitioned subset of the 
   provider network that contains at least one virtual P-node and 
   virtual links connecting virtual P-nodes and PEs. 

   Same as the Virtual Node service sub-model, the CE-PE routing 
   protocol is restricted to the one that the provider network supports. 

   How to represent the virtual provider network topology becomes an 
   issue when advertising the abstract routing information to the CE,. 
   To keep the provider network secure, address masking may be needed in 
   this service sub-model. Before advertising the virtual topology to 
   the CEs using routing protocols, it is required to build this virtual 
   view including the routing information about virtual P-nodes and 
   virtual links interconnecting the virtual P-nodes and PEs.

   In the Per-VPN Peer service sub-model, the application of resource 
   management is the same as in the Virtual Link service sub-model. 
   Manual or automatic resource allocation methods can be applied to 
   this service sub-model. 

   Depending on the abstract routing information the CE may designate an 
   Explicit Route object (ERO) with an abstract route through the VPN 
   backbone and use this to signal the L1VPN connection LSP. When the PE 
   receives this ERO it must translate the abstract route into a real 
   route through the provider network. In this case, a 
   "devirtualization" mechanism to expand and translate the ERO may be 
   required. On the other hand, when a Record Route object (RRO) is 
   requested, the RRO passed to the CE must be re-translated into an 
   abstract route. So new applicability to current signaling protocol 
   may be needed. 

5. Security Considerations 

   Security issue for the four Extended Mode sub-models which we mostly 
   focus on is Topology Confidentiality, that is described in separate 
   sub-sections of Section 3.
