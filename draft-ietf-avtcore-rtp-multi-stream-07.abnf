avg_rtcp_size = (1/16) * div_packet_size + (15/16) * avg_rtcp_size





tt = tn.  If AVPF or SAVPF is being used, then T_rr_int based
T_rr_interval == 0, as well as option 1, 2a and 2b for T_rr_interval
T_rr_interval = 4 seconds to avoid premature timeouts.

T_rr_interval = 4 seconds gives actual RTCP intervals near to those
