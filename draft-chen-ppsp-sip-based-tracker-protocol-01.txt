Internet-Draft       SIP-based Tracker Protocol           October 2010


1. Introduction

   As one of the important protocol components of PPSP, the Tracker
   Protocol provides communication between Trackers and Peers, by which
   Peers report streaming status to the tracker and request candidate
   lists from the tracker. [1] proposes two kinds of PPSP tracker
   protocols, binary encoding protocol and text-based encoding protocol
   like HTTP/XML protocol.

   This draft introduces a kind of text-based encoding PPSP Tracker
   Protocol, the SIP-based Tracker Protocol, which utilizes SIP messages
   to realize the functions of Tracker Protocol and carries the specific
   xml information mentioned in tracker protocol[1] messages in SIP body.

   Section 2 outlines the protocol overview.

   Section 3 defines the key signaling flows of SIP-based P2P streaming
   Tracker Protocol.

2. Protocol Overview

2.1. Description of the SIP-based Tracker Protocol

   SIP-based Tracker Protocol is a kind of text-based encoding tracker
   protocol realized by SIP protocol[2], i.e. the request and response
   messages of PPSP tracker protocol can be realized by SIP request and
   response messages, not carried in SIP Message body; the specific xml
   information mentioned in tracker protocol[1] is carried in SIP body.

2.2. MAPPING Methods of Tracker Protocol into SIP Methods

   This section outlines the mapping relations between SIP Request and
   Request defined in Tracker Protocol[1], shown in Fig.1.

          +--------------------+----------------------------+
          | PPSP Request Method|       SIP Request Method   |
          +--------------------+----------------------------+
          |     CONNECT        |           Register         |
          |    DISCONNECT      |           Register         |
          |     JOIN           |             Invite         |
          |     LEAVE          |              BYE           |
          |     FIND           |            INFO            |
          |   KEEPALIVE        |            Register        |
          |  STAT_QUERY        |             OPTIONS        |
          |  STAT_REPORT       |             PUBLISH        |
          |  JOIN_CHUNK        |        SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY    |
          +--------------------+----------------------------+

     Figure 1 Mapping between SIP Request and Tracker Protocol Request

   In addition, Tracker Protocol Responses can be realized by SIP
   Responses, like HTTP realization in [1], because SIP response codes
   are consistent with, and extend, HTTP/1.1 response codes.

3. Signaling Flows

   This section defines the key signaling flows.

3.1. Peer Registration Flow

   After Connect operation completes or a peer registers on the tracker,
   the peer may send additional requests to the tracker, like to publish
   content availability, or obtain lists of peers with specific content
   from the tracker.

   Tracker Protocol Connect operation defined in [1] is realized by SIP
   Register flow specified in [2], shown in Fig.3. For example, SIP
   Register flow can finish the authentication and authorization
   functions required by PPSP tracker protocol in the way such as HTTP
   digest, AKA etc.

      Peer                                     Tracker
       |                                          |
       |                                          |
       |                                          |
       |                                          |
       | SIP Register                             |

       | SIP Register                             |
       |----------------------------------------->|
       |                                          |
       |                                          |
       | SIP 200OK                                |
       |<-----------------------------------------|
       |                                          |

                      Figure 3 Peer Registration Flow

3.2. Peer De-registration Flow

   Tracker Protocol DISCONNET operation defined in [1] is realized by
   SIP REGISTER method with "Expires" value equaling to 0 defined in [2],
   shown in Fig.4.

3.3. Join Swarm Flow

   Tracker Protocol JOIN operation defined in [1] is realized by SIP
   Invite flow specified in [2], shown in Fig.5. Through the flow, the
   tracker knows a peer sending the invite message wishes to participate
   in a particular swarm; the peer can get what it needs from the other
   peers in the swarm.

3.4. Content Availability Report Flow

   Tracker Protocol Join_Chunk operation defined in [1] is to realize
   the function of reporting the content availability, i.e. to report
   which chunks a peer has and which swarms it has joined in to the

   tracker. This function is realized by SIP Subscribe/Notify method
   defined in [3], shown in Fig.6. After subscribed successfully, a peer
   will notify the tracker when the content possessed by the peer
   changes.

   Tracker Protocol LEAVE operation defined in [1] is realized by SIP
   Bye and Notify flow specified in [2] and [3], shown in Fig.7. Through
   this flow, peers notify the tracker that they no longer are
   participating in (either sharing or requesting) a particular swarm.

3.7. Keep Alive Flow

   Tracker Protocol KEEPALIVE operation defined in [1] is realized by
   SIP Register flow defined in [2], shown in Fig.9.

3.8. Information Query Flow

   Tracker Protocol STAT_Query operation defined in [1] is realized by
   SIP Options flow Specified in [2]. Because STAT_Query method works in
   two directions, a peer or a tracker can query stat information to the
   other, shown in Fig.10 and Fig.11.

      Peer                                     Tracker

3.9. Information Report Flow

   Tracker Protocol STAT_REPORT operation defined in [1] is realized by
   SIP Publish flow, Specified in [5]. Because STAT_REPORT method works
   in two directions, a peer or a tracker can publish stat information
   to the other, shown in Fig.12 and Fig.13.

4. Open Issues

   Need to decide if SIP Register message is the best selection which is
   used to realize the Keepalive function in 3.7 compared with other SIP
   requests like SIP Message.
