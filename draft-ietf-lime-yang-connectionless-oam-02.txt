 Generic YANG Data Model for Connectionless Operations, Administration,
                     and Maintenance(OAM) protocols
               draft-ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam-02

Abstract

   This document presents a base YANG Data model for connectionless OAM
   protocols.  It provides a technology-independent abstraction of key
   OAM constructs for connectionless protocols.  The Based model
   presented here can be extended to include technology specific
   details.  This is leading to uniformity between OAM protocols and
   support nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at
   different or same levels through a unified interface).

1.  Introduction

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) are important
   networking functions that allow operators to:

   1.  Monitor networks connections (Reachability Verification,
       Continuity Check).

   2.  Troubleshoot failures (Fault verification and localization).

   3.  Monitor Performance

   An overview of OAM tools is presented at [RFC7276].

   Ping and Traceroute [RFC792], [RFC4443] are well-known fault
   verification and isolation tools, respectively, for IP networks.
   Over the years, different technologies have developed similar tools
   for similar purposes.

   In this document, we presents a base YANG Data model for
   connectionless OAM protocols.  The generic YANG model for
   connectionless OAM only includes configuration data and state data.
   It can be used in conjunction with data retrieval method model[lime
   retrieval methods], which focuses on data retrival procedures like
   RPC.  However it also can be used independently of data retrieval
   method model.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  client

   o  configuration data

   o  server

   o  state data

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  augment

2.1.  Terminology

   TP - Test Point

   MAC - Media Access Control

   BFD - Bidirectional Forwarding Detection

   RPC - A Remote Procedure Call, as used within the NETCONF protocol

2.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   Each node is printed as:

   <status> <flags> <name> <opts> <type>

   <status> is one of:
        +  for current
        x  for deprecated
        o  for obsolete


   <flags> is one of:

       rw for configuration data
       ro for non-configuration data
       -x for rpcs
       -n for notifications


   <name> is the name of the node

   If the node is augmented into the tree from another module, its name
   is printed as <prefix>:<name>.

   <opts> is one of:

        ?  for an optional leaf or choice
        !  for a presence container
        *  for a leaf-list or list
        [<keys>] for a list's keys

   <type> is the name of the type for leafs and leaf-lists

3.  Overview of the Connectionless OAM Model

   At the top of the Model, there is an oper container for session
   statistics.  Grouping is also defined for common session statistics
   and these are applicable for proactive OAM sessions.  Multiple test-
   point-locations keyed using technology specific keys (eg., IPv4
   address for IPv4 locations) are possible by augmented network nodes
   which are defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo] to
   describe the network hierarchies and the inventory of nodes contained
   in a network.  Each test-point-location is chosen based on location-
   type which when chosen, leads to a container that includes a list of
   test-point-locations keyed by technology specific keys.  Each test
   point location includes a test-point-location-info.  The test-point-
   location-info includes tp-technology, tp-tools, and connectionless-
   oam-layers.  The groupings of tp-address and tp-address-vrf are kept
   out of test-point-location-info to make it addressing agnostic and
   allow varied composition.  Depending upon the choice of the location-
   type (determined by the tp-address-vrf), the containers differ in its
   composition of test-point-locations while the test-point-location-
   info, is a common aspect of every test-point-location.  The vrf is
   used to describe the corresponding network instance.  The tp-
   technology indicate oam technology details.  The tp-tools describe
   the oam tools supported.  The connectionless-oam- layers is used to
   describe the relationship of one test point with other test points.
   The level in oam-layers indicate whether related oam test point is
   client layer, server layer or same layer.  The Model is augmented to
   /nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node using Test Point Locations defined
   below.

3.1.  TP Address

   In connectionless OAM, the tp address is defined with the following
   type:

   o  MAC address

   o  IPv4 or IPv6 address

   o  a pair of source, destination addresses, and interface (Useful for
      BFD)

   o  FEC

   o  System-id to represent the device or node.

3.2.  Tools

   In connectionless OAM, the tools attribute is used to describe a
   toolset for fault detection and isolation, and for performance
   measurement.  And it can serve as a constraint condition when the
   base model be extended to specific OAM technology.  For example, to
   fulfill the icmp ping configuration, the "../coam:tools-ip/
   coam:rfc792" should be set to "true", and then the lime base model
   should be augmented with icmp ping specific details.

3.3.  OAM-layers

   As typical networks have a multi-layer architecture, the set of OAM
   protocols similarly take a multi-layer structure; each layer has its
   own OAM protocols [RFC7276] and is corresponding to specific network
   portion or pathand has associated test points.  OAM-layers is
   referred to a list of upper layer, lower layer that are related to
   current test point.  This allow users to easily navigate up and down
   to efficiently troubleshoot a connectivity issue at different layer.
   In this model, we have kept level default as 0, when all test points
   are located at the same layer.  Level is provided for scenarios where
   it might be possible to define layering relationship as it can be
   used to stitching fault at related oam layers.  For example, there is
   a network in which data traffic between two customer edges is
   transported over three consecutive network portions, the current test
   point is located in the second network portion.  If there is a defect
   in the first network portion is located at the upstream of the second
   network portion, the level of the first network portion is set to
   "-1".  If the third network portion is located at the downstream of
   the second network portion and the level is set to "1".  In another
   case, if the first network portion and the third network portion is
   in the same level of thesecond network portion, the level is set to
   "0".  The snippet below depicts an example of OAM layers.

3.4.  Test Point Locations Information

   This is a generic grouping for Test Point Locations Information.  It
   Provide details of Test Point Location using Tools, OAM-Layers
   grouping defined above.

3.5.  Test Point Locations

   This is a generic grouping for Test Point Locations.  Choice
   statement is used to define locations types, for example ipv4-
   location-type, ipv6-location-type, etc.  Container is defined under
   each location type containing list keyed to test point address, Test
   Point Location Information defined in section above, and routing
   instance vrf name if required.

3.6.  Path Discovery Data

   This is a generic grouping for path discovery data model that can be
   retrieved by any data retrieval methods including RPCs.  Path
   discovery data output from methods, includes src-test-point, dst-
   test-point, sequence-number, hop-cnt, session statistics of various
   kinds,path verification and path trace related information.  Path
   discovery includes data to be retrieved on a per-hop basis via a list
   of path-trace-info-list which includes information like timestamps,
   ingress-interface, egress-interface and app-meta-data.  The path
   discovery data model is made generic enough to allow active, passive
   and hybrid OAMs to do the retrieval.  None of the fields are made
   mandatory for that reason.  Noted that the retrieval methods are
   defined in [lime retrieval methods].

   be retrieved by any data retrieval methods including RPCs.
   Continuity check data output from methods, includes src-test-point,
   dst-test-point, sequence-number, hop-cnt and session statistics of
   various kinds.  The continuity check data model is made generic
   enough to allow active, passive and hybrid OAMs to do the retrieval.

5.  CL model applicability

   ietf-connectionless-oam model defined in this document provides
   technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for
   connectionless protocols.  This model can be further extended to
   include technology specific details, e.g., adding new data nodes with
   technology specific functions and parameters into proper anchor
   points of the base model, so as to develop a technology-specific
   connectionless OAM model.

Internet-Draft       Connection-Less OAM YANG model         October 2016


   This section demonstrates the usability of the connectionless YANG
   OAM data model to various connectionless OAM technologies, e.g., BFD,
   LSP ping.  Note that, in this section, we only present several
   snippets of technology-specific model extensions for illustrative
   purposes.  The complete model extensions should be worked on in
   respective protocol working groups.

5.1.  BFD Extension

   The following sections shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model
   can be extended to cover BFD technology.  For this purpose, a set of
   extension are introduced such as technology-type extension and test-
   point attributes extension.

   Note that in BFD WG, there is a BFD yang data model
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang] to be produced.  Users can choose to use both BFD
   model and "ietf-connectioless-oam" as basis and augment the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" model with bfd specific details.  The bfd
   specific details can be the grouping defined in the BFD model.

5.1.1.  technology type extension

   No BFD technology type has been defined in the "ietf-connectionless-
   oam" model.  Therefore a technology type extension is required in the
   LIME BFD model.

   The snippet below depicts an example of augmenting "bfd" type into
   the ietf-connectionless-oam":

           augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/"
           +"coam:location-type/coam:ipv4-location-type"
           +"/coam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/"
           +"coam:test-point-locations/coam:technology"
           +"/coam:technology-string"
           {
             leaf bfd{
              type string;
             }
           }



5.1.2.  test point attributes extension

   To derive a model for bfd technology, the "ietf-connectionless-oam"
   model can be extended.  Some data nodes for bfd specific parameters
   can be defined and inserted into the proper "test-point-location"




Kumar, et al.              Expires May 4, 2017                 [Page 44]

Internet-Draft       Connection-Less OAM YANG model         October 2016


   list.  Or some new "location-type" cases can be added to support the
   some bfd technologies such as "bfd over MPLS-TE", etc.

5.1.2.1.  Define and insert new nodes into corresponding test-point-
          location

   In the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model, multiple "test-point-
   location" lists are defined under the "location-type" choice node.
   Therefore, to derive model for some bfd technologies( such as ip
   single-hop, ip multi-hops, etc), data nodes for bfd specific details
   can be defined and inserted into corresponding "test-point-locations"
   list.  In this section, we reuse some groupings which are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang] to derive following example.

   The snippet below shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can
   be extended to "BFD IP single-hop":

           augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/"
           +"coam:location-type/coam:ipv4-location-type"
           +"/coam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/"
           +"coam:test-point-locations"
           {
           container session-cfg {
             description "BFD IP single-hop session configuration";
             list sessions {
               key "interface dest-addr";
               description "List of IP single-hop sessions";
               leaf interface {
                 type if:interface-ref;
                 description
                   "Interface on which the BFD session is running.";
               }
               leaf dest-addr {
                 type inet:ip-address;
                 description "IP address of the peer";
               }

               uses bfd:bfd-grouping-common-cfg-parms;
               uses bfd:bfd-grouping-echo-cfg-parms;
             }
           }
           }

   Edit note: To prevent new attribute to be defined in the CL extension
   model,[I-D.ietf-bfd-yang] should define the attributes that are used
   by CL model as grouping, then CL extension model can reuse these
   grouping.  We will make accordingly change when these grouping are
   available in the BFD model.

   Similar augmentations can be defined to support other BFD
   technologies such as BFD IP multi-hop, BFD over MPLS, etc.

5.1.2.2.  Add new location-type cases

   In the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model, If no a proper "test-point-
   locations" can be extended, new "location-type" cases can be defined
   and inserted into the "location-type" choice node.

   Therefore, the model user can flexible add "location-type" to support
   other kinds of test point which are not defined in the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" model.  In this section, we add a new "location-
   type" case and reuse some groupings which are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang] to derive the following example.

   The snippet below shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model can
   be extended to "BFD over MPLS-TE":

           augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/coam:location-type"{
            case te-location{
             list test-point-location-list{
              key "tunnel-name";
              leaf tunnel-name{
               type leafref{
                    path "/te:te/te:tunnels/te:tunnel/te:name";
                   }
                   description
                   "point to a te instance.";
              }
               uses bfd:bfd-grouping-common-cfg-parms;
           uses bfd-mpls:bfd-encap-cfg;
             }
            }
           }


   Similar augmentations can be defined to support other BFD
   technologies such as BFD over LAG, etc.

5.2.  LSP ping extension

   The following sections shows how the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model
   can be extended to cover LSP ping technology.  For this purpose, a
   set of extension are introduced such as technology-type extension and
   test-point attributes extension.

   Note that in MPLS WG, there is a LSP Ping yang data model
   [I-D.draft-zheng-mpls-lsp-ping-yang-cfg] to be produced.  Users can

Internet-Draft       Connection-Less OAM YANG model         October 2016


   choose to use both LSP Ping model and "ietf-connectioless-oam" as
   basis and augment the "ietf-connectionless-oam" model with LSP Ping
   specific details.  The LSP Ping specific details can be the grouping
   defined in the LSP ping model.

5.2.1.  technology type extension

   No lsp-ping technology type has been defined in the "ietf-
   connectionless-oam" model.  Therefore a technology type extension is
   required in the LIME LSP ping model.

   The snippet below depicts an example of augmenting "lsp-ping" type
   into the "ietf-connectionless-oam":

           augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/"
           +"coam:location-type/coam:ipv4-location-type"
           +"/coam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/"
           +"coam:test-point-locations/coam:technology"
           +"/coam:technology-string"
           {
            leaf lsp-ping{
              type string;
             }
           }


5.2.2.  test point attributes extension

   In order to derive a model for lsp-ping, the "ietf-connectionless-
   oam" model can be extended.  Some data nodes for lsp-ping specific
   parameters can be defined and inserted into the proper "test-point-
   location" list.

   User can reuse the attributes or groupings which are defined in
   [I-D.draft-zheng-mpls-lsp-ping-yang-cfg] to derive the "lime lsp
   ping" model.

   The snippet below depicts an example of augmenting lsp ping
   attributes into the "test-point-locations" list:

Internet-Draft       Connection-Less OAM YANG model         October 2016


           augment "/nd:networks/nd:network/nd:node/"
           +"coam:location-type/coam:ipv4-location-type"
           +"/coam:test-point-ipv4-location-list/"
           +"coam:test-point-locations"
           {
   list lsp-ping {
            key "lsp-ping-name";
            leaf lsp-ping-name {
             type string {
               length "1..31";
            }
           mandatory "true";
           description "LSP Ping test name.";
           ......
         }


   Edit note: To prevent new attribute to be defined in the CL extension
   model,[I-D.draft-zheng-mpls-lsp-ping-yang-cfg] should define the
   attributes that are used by CL model as grouping, then CL extension
   model can reuse these grouping.  We will make accordingly change when
   these grouping are available in the LSP ping model.
