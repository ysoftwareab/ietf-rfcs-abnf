Abstract 

   This document describes a YANG data model for traffic steering 
   policies in Distributed Data Center (DDC) scenarios. The policy 
   model is a specific data model for traffic steering using VPN 
   technology. It helps the service management in Simplified Use of 
   Policy Abstractions (SUPA) to model the policy (a set of 
   constraints and rules) that defines how a VPN service is monitored 
   and managed during its lifecycle. Two traffic steering 
   applications have been provided such as traffic optimization with 
   pass or bypass specific nodes or sites.

1. Introduction 

   In order to support the DDC service with VPN connection as well as 
   new services, it brings new requirements for both network 
   providers and service providers. Rapid uptake of new services 
   requires dynamic service provisioning capabilities in the service 
   management. This is achieved using policies that can be created by 
   the operators once and the service management refers to these 
   policies to infer how a given service needs to be provisioned 
   considering the current state of the network.   

   A policy defines:

   1. An event or a set of events that trigger the evaluation of 
   policy: This is the trigger for the service management application 
   to evaluate if a policy needs to be applied. For example a user 
   action to provision a new VPN service can be a event. 

   2. A set of conditions that need to be satisfied for the policy to 
   be applicable: This enables service management to select the right 
   policy by validating the conditions against the current network 
   state.  

   3. A set of actions that should be triggered as part of the policy 
   execution: This enables the service management to provision the 
   service. 

   Meanwhile, DDC service which is mainly relied on VPN [RFC4110] 
   needs policy based management and controlling capability from the 
   service management systems to facilitate the service deployment 
   both inter data centers and within data center. 

   This document introduces YANG [RFC6020] [RFC6021] data models for 
   SUPA configuration.  Such models can facilitate the 
   standardization for the interface of SUPA, as they are compatible 
   to a variety of protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and [RESTCONF]. 
   Please note that in the context of SUPA, the term "application" 
   refers to an operational and management applications employed, and 
   possibly implemented, by an operator. The policy model is based on 
   the first example - DDC services. 

   With respect to the scope, defining an information model for the 
   policy exchange between the policy manager and policy agent and a 
   corresponding data model based on yang to support specific DDC 
   service use case is initial goal of this document. The protocol 
   specific aspects are deferred to respective implementations. Also 
   certain foundational concepts of the model are intentionally left 
   open to enable future extension. Here the traffic steering policy 
   in DDC use case provides a concrete example for a specific network 
   technology and service, as what constitutes a policy could itself 
   vary depending on the context where it is used, e.g. there could 
   be tenant specific policies, site specific, network domain 
   specific etc.

3. Network Configuration Model Overview 

   Figure 1 illustrates the network configuration model which 
   contains several modules for specific services such as VPN 
   management. Basically, service model is to define the creation and 
   configuration of the VPN service, while the policy model is more 
   focused on the adjustment or optimization of the flow path during 
   the lifecycle of the VPN service based on the predefined policy.

4. Network Policy Configuration Modules 

   In this section, a policy model is defined with two applications 
   for traffic steering between data centers are provided to 
   illustrate how to use the policy model. The policy model and 
   policy configuration are based on a set of specific network 
   services and the framework of SUPA [SUPA-framework]. 

4.1. Network Policy Model 

   In SUPA framework, network policy is a predefined rule or a set of 
   rules that the service management use to map the service to the 
   lower level network infrastructures. Among different types of 
   policy models, the SUPA policy model is focused on an E-C-A 
   (Event-Condition-Action) YANG data model. Within SUPA scope, the 
   service management system takes the E-C-A fashioned policy model 
   to handle the VPN management in the data center use case to 
   improve bandwidth utilization and facilitate service deployment.  

   Event, in a policy model the event is the object that the 
   administration system monitors. All the consequence actions are

   all based on the event. Condition is whether the parameter of the 
   monitored event or a certain network characteristic matches with 
   certain state. Action is the corresponding operation of the 
   network service management.

4.2. Policy Applications in DDC services 

   The following describes SUPA policy model designed for DDC 
   services use case [SUPA-DDC] to do the traffic steering among DCs. 
   [SUPA-DDC] took a large-scale Internet Data Center (IDC) operator 
   as an example to describe what SUPA needs to do in VPN-based 
   traffic steering. Here the policy model only focus on the policy 
   based traffic steering application. 

   The traffic steering policy is used in dynamical link 
   configuration in DDC services [SUPA-DDC]. The service management 
   can dynamically adjust the traffic flow in the links based on 
   traffic steering policy. The policy model specifies some high 
   level requirements to the links, like routing strategy. For 
   example in this specific traffic steering policy model, if the 
   link bandwidth usage is above certain threshold, the monitored 
   flow will be forced to routed to the third place to bypass the 
   overloaded node or site.  

   Module "ietf-supa-policy" defines E-C-A based policy model to 
   describe the policy management in DDC service. In effect, the 
   module can be expanded with more operation services for DDC 
   services.
