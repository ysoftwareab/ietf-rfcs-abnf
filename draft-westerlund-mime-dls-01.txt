1. Introduction

   The present document seeks to register a media type for
   Downloadable Sounds (DLS). The DLS format is used to define
   instruments for widely used wavetable synthesizers associated with
   the standards [DLS1, DLS2, MDLS]. DLS, and their associated
   standards are maintained and defined by two organizations, the MIDI
   Manufacturers Association (MMA) and the Association of the Musical
   Electronics Industry (AMEI).

   The media type defined here is needed to correctly identify DLS
   files when they are served over HTTP, included in multi-part
   documents, or used in other places where media types are used.


2. Security Considerations

   The DLS format may contain audio, displayable text data, and
   modeling parameters (a.k.a. articulation parameters). In addition,
   the DLS format contains a so-called conditional chunk which is
   'active' in the sense that it affects the execution of a DLS file
   parser. However, the DLS format does not currently define any
   scripting mechanism.

   Clearly it is possible to author malicious files which, for
   example, contain large amounts of data always blocked by a
   conditional statement, i.e. no synthesizer loads the instruments.

   However, for DLS, clients can and usually do protect themselves
   against these kinds of attacks. For DLS content containing
   conditional chunks it is stressed that the chunk in question is
   optional, that is to say a parser does not have to execute the
   chunk. However, if a parser evaluates a conditional chunk, it is
   still possible to parse its content and draw a conclusion whether
   or not it is usable for a particular synthesizer engine.

   It should be noted that selected metadata fields may include
   information partly intended to protect the media against
   unauthorized use or distribution. In this case the intention is
   that alteration or removal of the data in the field would be
   treated as an offence under national agreements based on World
   Intellection Property Organization (WIPO) treaties.

   DLS have an extensible structure, making it theoretically possible
   to define metadata fields or media formats in the future which
   could be used to induce particular actions of the recipient, and
   thus present additional security risks. However, this type of
   capability is currently not supported in the referenced
   specifications.

   There is no current provision in the DLS standard for encryption,
   signing, or authentication within the file formats.


3. IANA Considerations

   The present document requests that IANA registers the media type
   audio/dls as specified in Section 3.1. The registration uses the
   template present in [RFC4288].


3.1. Media Type for Downloadable Sounds

   Type name:                         audio

   Subtype name:                      dls

   Required parameters:               none

   Optional parameters:               'dls-type'
                                      A comma-separated list of the
                                      dls types (one or more) that the
                                      file content conforms to. The
                                      following values are specified:
                                      0, 1, and 2 signify Downloadable
                                      Sounds Level 1.1b content,
                                      Downloadable Sounds Level 2.1
                                      content, and Mobile Downloadable
                                      Sound content, respectively. All
                                      types that the content conforms
                                      to should be indicated. Further
                                      values (integers) may be
                                      specified in the future, and any
                                      unknown values shall be ignored.
                                      If the parameter is not
                                      specified, it corresponds to a
                                      value equal to 0, i.e. the
                                      content conforms to Downloadable
                                      Sound level 1.1b.

   Encoding considerations:           DLS files are binary and should
                                      be transmitted in a suitable
                                      encoding without CR/LF
                                      conversion, 7-bit stripping
                                      etc.; base64 [RFC3548] is a
                                      suitable encoding.

   Security considerations:           see the security considerations
                                      in section 3 of RFC XXXX.

   Interoperability considerations:   This media type is for the
                                      consumption by a MIDI player
                                      capable of utilizing
                                      downloadable sounds for its
                                      synthesizers. A general purpose
                                      audio player will not be capable
                                      of utilizing the audio within
                                      the format without explicit
                                      support of the format.
