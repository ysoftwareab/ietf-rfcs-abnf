Internet-Draft              HBT Requirements                October 2009


1.  Introduction

   Several wireless operators are trying to deploy IPv6 only networks in
   order to reduce their dependence on the availability of scarce IPv4
   addresses.  These networks need to support hosts that run legacy IPv4
   applications that cannot be rewritten to support IPv6 or dual stack.
   For achieving this objective some form of host based translation
   (HBT) solution is needed and this document sets out the motivation
   and requirements for such a solution.  The document is intended to
   foster discussion about the requirements and to encourage the
   creation of HBT solutions.

2.  Requirements for a HBT solution

   The requirements that need to be met by a HBT solution are described
   along with their underlying motivations.

2.1.  R1: Support for Legacy IPv4 applications

   The operators have several applications (conservatively hundreds)
   widely deployed that are not IPv6 aware and can communicate only over
   IPv4.  Those IPv4 applications need to communicate with both the IPv4
   hosts and IPv6 hosts.  Some of these applications may be reworked to
   become dual stacked but for the vast majority of these applications,
   it is impractical to migrate the application over.  This can be due
   to several reasons. e.g. long-tail of IPv4 application, financially
   not viable, source code not available, based on IPv6 unaware
   application frameworks.

2.2.  R2: Support IPv6 only networks

   Almost all wireless operators are facing a serious shortage of IPv4
   address space and this has started to hinder subscriber growth.  For
   this reason, operators are interested in deploying IPv6-only networks
   for all new network rollouts.  Additionally, the operators see
   significant management complexity and costs arising out of operating
   dual stack networks.  The operators also use equipment that can be
   upgraded to support IPv6 but not necessarily support dual stack.

2.3.  R3: Minimize overhead on wireless links

   Wireless spectrum is a very valuable and scarce resource.  Due to
   this, the operators wish to eliminate unnecessary overhead on the
   wireless links, if possible.  Thus if a translation based solution is
   possible, it is preferred over a tunneling based solution that will
   end up adding an additional IP header over the air.

2.4.  R4: Allow decentralized peer-to-peer communication

   When legacy IPv4 applications on two hosts need to communicate with
   each other they must use the most direct route to carry the packets.
   Due to the scale of some of these networks routing all packets
   through a central point(s) in the network is undesirable if not
   impractical.  It also eliminates bottlenecks and single points of
   failure in the network.

2.5.  R5: Simplify DNS Deployment

   Legacy IPv4 applications need to identify the remote peer's IP
   address for a successful communication.  The DNS is an important

   infrastructure and changes of DNS have an impact on the whole network
   scale.  So the operator would like to simplify the DNS deployment
   during IPv6 transition.  Wherever the host is, it must be able to
   translate the DNS query to the format that the DNS server can
   understand and handle replied resource record to a format the
   application can use.
