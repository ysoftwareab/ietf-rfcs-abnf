1.  Introduction

   As the industry becomes more sophisticated and network devices (e.g.,
   Internet of Things, Self-driving vehicles, and VoIP/VoLTE
   smartphones), service providers have a lot of problems described in
   [RFC8192].  To resolve these problems, [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability]
   specifies the information model of the capabilities of Network
   Security Functions (NSFs).

   This document provides a YANG data model [RFC6020][RFC7950] that
   defines the capabilities of NSFs to centrally manage the capabilities
   of those security devices.  The security devices can register their

   own capabilities into a Network Operator Management (Mgmt) System
   (i.e., Security Controller) with this YANG data model through the
   registration interface [RFC8329].  With the capabilities of those
   security devices maintained centrally, those security devices can be
   more easily managed [RFC8329].  This YANG data model is based on the
   information model for I2NSF NSF capabilities
   [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability].

   This YANG data model uses an "Event-Condition-Action" (ECA) policy
   model that is used as the basis for the design of I2NSF Policy as
   described in [RFC8329] and [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability].  The "ietf-
   i2nsf-capability" YANG module defined in this document provides the
   following features:

   o  Definition for general capabilities of network security functions.

   o  Definition for event capabilities of generic network security
      functions.

   o  Definition for condition capabilities of generic network security
      functions.

   o  Definition for condition capabilities of advanced network security
      functions.

   o  Definition for action capabilities of generic network security
      functions.

   o  Definition for resolution strategy capabilities of generic network
      security functions.

   o  Definition for default action capabilities of generic network
      security functions.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119][RFC8174].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in
   [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability][RFC8431].  Especially, the following
   terms are from [RFC3444]:

   o  Data Model: A data model is a representation of concepts of
      interest to an environment in a form that is dependent on data



Hares, et al.           Expires February 26, 2021               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      I2NSF Capability YANG Data Model         August 2020


      repository, data definition language, query language,
      implementation language, and protocol.

   o  Information Model: An information model is a representation of
      concepts of interest to an environment in a form that is
      independent of data repository, data definition language, query
      language, implementation language, and protocol.

3.1.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is
   referred from [RFC8340].

4.  Overview

   This section provides as overview of how the YANG data model can be
   used in the I2NSF framework described in [RFC8329].  Figure 1 shows
   the capabilities (e.g., firewall and web filter) of NSFs in the I2NSF
   Framework.  As shown in this figure, an NSF Developer's Management
   System can register NSFs and the capabilities that the network
   security device can support.  To register NSFs in this way, the
   Developer's Management System utilizes this standardized capability
   YANG data model through the I2NSF Registration Interface
   [draft-ietf-i2nsf-registration-interface-dm].  That is, this
   Registration Interface uses the YANG module described in this
   document to describe the capability of a network security function
   that is registered with the Security Controller.  With the
   capabilities of those network security devices maintained centrally,
   those security devices can be more easily managed, which can resolve
   many of the problems described in [RFC8192].

   In Figure 1, a new NSF at a Developer's Management Systems has
   capabilities of Firewall (FW) and Web Filter (WF), which are denoted
   as (Cap = {FW, WF}), to support Event-Condition-Action (ECA) policy
   rules where 'E', 'C', and 'A' mean "Event", "Condition", and
   "Action", respectively.  The condition involves IPv4 or IPv6
   datagrams, and the action includes "Allow" and "Deny" for those
   datagrams.

   Note that the NSF-Facing Interface is used to configure the security
   policy rules of the generic network security functions
   [draft-ietf-i2nsf-nsf-facing-interface-dm], and The configuration of
   advanced security functions over the NSF-Facing Interface is used to
   configure the security policy rules of advanced network security
   functions (e.g., anti-virus and anti-DDoS attack), respectively,
   according to the capabilities of NSFs registered with the I2NSF
   Framework.

             Figure 1: Capabilities of NSFs in I2NSF Framework

   A use case of an NSF with the capabilities of firewall and web filter
   is described as follows.

   o  If a network manager wants to apply security policy rules to block
      malicious users with firewall and web filter, it is a tremendous
      burden for a network administrator to apply all of the needed
      rules to NSFs one by one.  This problem can be resolved by
      managing the capabilities of NSFs in this document.

   o  If a network administrator wants to block malicious users for IPv6
      traffic, he sends a security policy rule to block the users to the
      Network Operator Management System using the I2NSF User (i.e., web
      application).

Internet-Draft      I2NSF Capability YANG Data Model         August 2020


   o  When the Network Operator Management System receives the security
      policy rule, it automatically sends that security policy rules to
      appropriate NSFs (i.e., NSF-m in Developer's Management System A
      and NSF-1 in Developer's Management System B) which can support
      the capabilities (i.e., IPv6).  This lets an I2NSF User not
      consider NSFs where the rule is applied.

   o  If NSFs encounter the suspicious IPv6 packets of malicious users,
      they can filter the packets out according to the configured
      security policy rule.  Therefore, the security policy rule against
      the malicious users' packets can be automatically applied to
      appropriate NSFs without human intervention.

   Time capabilities are used to specify the capabilities which describe
   when to execute the I2NSF policy rule.  The time capabilities are
   defined in terms of absolute time and periodic time.  The absolute
   time means the exact time to start or end.  The periodic time means
   repeated time like day, week, or month.  See Section 3.4.6
   (Capability Algebra) in [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability] for more
   information about the time-based condition (e.g., time period) in the
   capability algebra.

   Event capabilities are used to specify the capabilities that describe
   the event that would trigger the evaluation of the condition clause
   of the I2NSF Policy Rule.  The defined event capabilities are system
   event and system alarm.  See Section 3.1 (Design Principles and ECA

   Policy Model Overview) in [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability] for more
   information about the event in the ECA policy model.

   Condition capabilities are used to specify capabilities of a set of
   attributes, features, and/or values that are to be compared with a
   set of known attributes, features, and/or values in order to
   determine whether or not the set of actions in that (imperative)
   I2NSF policy rule can be executed.  The condition capabilities are
   classified in terms of generic network security functions and
   advanced network security functions.  The condition capabilities of
   generic network security functions are defined as IPv4 capability,
   IPv6 capability, TCP capability, UDP capability, and ICMP capability.
   The condition capabilities of advanced network security functions are
   defined as anti-virus capability, anti-DDoS capability, IPS
   capability, HTTP capability, and VoIP/VoLTE capability.  See
   Section 3.1 (Design Principles and ECA Policy Model Overview) in
   [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability] for more information about the
   condition in the ECA policy model.  Also, see Section 3.4.3 (I2NSF
   Condition Clause Operator Types) in [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability] for
   more information about the operator types in an I2NSF condition
   clause.

   Action capabilities are used to specify the capabilities that
   describe the control and monitoring aspects of flow-based NSFs when
   the event and condition clauses are satisfied.  The action
   capabilities are defined as ingress-action capability, egress-action
   capability, and log-action capability.  See Section 3.1 (Design
   Principles and ECA Policy Model Overview) in
   [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability] for more information about the action
   in the ECA policy model.  Also, see Section 7.2 (NSF-Facing Flow
   Security Policy Structure) in [RFC8329] for more information about
   the ingress and egress actions.  In addition, see Section 9.1 (Flow-
   Based NSF Capability Characterization) for more information about
   logging at NSFs.

   Resolution strategy capabilities are used to specify the capabilities
   that describe conflicts that occur between the actions of the same or
   different policy rules that are matched and contained in this
   particular NSF.  The resolution strategy capabilities are defined as
   First Matching Rule (FMR), Last Matching Rule (LMR), Prioritized
   Matching Rule (PMR), Prioritized Matching Rule with Errors (PMRE),
   and Prioritized Matching Rule with No Errors (PMRN).  See
   Section 3.4.2 (Conflict, Resolution Strategy and Default Action) in
   [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability] for more information about the
   resolution strategy.

   Default action capabilities are used to specify the capabilities that
   describe how to execute I2NSF policy rules when no rule matches a

   packet.  The default action capabilities are defined as pass, drop,
   alert, and mirror.  See Section 3.4.2 (Conflict, Resolution Strategy
   and Default Action) in [draft-ietf-i2nsf-capability] for more
   information about the default action.

   IPsec method capabilities are used to specify capabilities of how to
   support an Internet Key Exchange (IKE) for the security
   communication.  The default action capabilities are defined as IKE or
   IKE-less.  See [draft-ietf-i2nsf-sdn-ipsec-flow-protection] for more
   information about the SDN-based IPsec flow protection in I2NSF.

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" registry [RFC7950][RFC8525].

      name: ietf-i2nsf-capability

      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-i2nsf-capability

      prefix: nsfcap

      reference: RFC XXXX

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a data schema
   designed to be accessed through network management protocols such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is
   the secure transport layer, and the required transport secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the required transport secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides a means of
   restricting access to specific NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable, creatable, and deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations to these data nodes
   could have a negative effect on network and security operations.

   o  ietf-i2nsf-capability: An attacker could alter the security
      capabilities associated with an NSF whereby disabling or enabling
      the evasion of security mitigations.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  ietf-i2nsf-capability: An attacker could gather the security
      capability information of any NSF and use this information to
      evade detection or filtering.
