1.  Introduction

   This document defines a data model for resume data in electronic
   human resource and professional networking applications and systems.

   Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the author(s).

   The representation of this data model is defined in the I-JSON format
   [RFC7493], which is a strict subset of the JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON) Data Interchange Format [RFC8259].  Using JSON is mostly a
   pragmatic choice: its widespread use makes JSResume easier to adopt,
   and the availability of production-ready JSON implementations
   eliminates a whole category of parser-related interoperability
   issues.

2.  Security Considerations

   TBD

3.  IANA Considerations

   TBD
