Abstract

   This document specifies extensions to GMPLS signalling with control 
   channel separation, [RFC3471], to use 128-bit IPv6 addresses to 
   identify routers in an IPv6 control plane.

1.  Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2.  Overview

   Currently, GMPLS signalling with control channel separation 
   identifies the particular data channel being controlled by providing 
   interface identification information TLVs [RFC3471].  For unnumbered 
   and component interfaces, interface indentification is achieved 
   through the tuple of a 32-bit IP address and an interface ID.  The IP 
   address field may carry either an IP address of a link or an IP 
   address associated with the router, where associated address is the 
   value carried in a router address TLV of routing.  

   An IPv6 address of a link is clearly 128-bits.  Also, drafts to 
   define traffic engineering extensions to IGP protocols for use in 
   IPv6 networks use 128-bit router addresses: see definition of "Router 
   IPv6 Address" in [OSPFv3-TE] and "IPv6 TE Router ID" in [ISIS-TE].  

   This document proposes a simple extension to [RFC3471] that allows 
   GMPLS signalling with control channel separation to be used with 
   an IPv6 control plane.

3.  Interface Identification

   A new TLV type is defined to extend the Interface_ID defined in 
   [RFC3471].  The type is 6, IPv6_IF_INDEX (suggested value; to be 
   assigned by IANA).  The length is 24 and the value fields have the 
   following format.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      IPv6 Address: 128 bits

         The IPv6 address field may carry either an IPv6 address of a 
         link or an IPv6 address associated with the router, where 
         associated address is the value carried in an IPv6 router 
         address TLV of routing.  That is, the "Router 
         IPv6 Address", [OSPFv3-TE], when the IGP is OSPFv3  and "IPv6 
         TE Router ID", [ISIS-TE], when the IGP is IS-IS.

      Interface ID: 32 bits

         As defined in [RFC3471].

   Note that [RFC3471] defines two other types, COMPONENT_IF_DOWNSTREAM 
   and COMPONENT_IF_UPSTREAM with the same format as the IF_INDEX type.  
   However, these types have been deprecated by [MPLS-BUNDLE].  
   Therefore, no IPv6 equivalents to COMPONENT_IF_DOWNSTREAM and 
   COMPONENT_IF_UPSTREAM are defined.  

6.  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new value for the Interface_ID Type: 6.
