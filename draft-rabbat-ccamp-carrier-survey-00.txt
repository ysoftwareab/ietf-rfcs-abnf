Abstract  
    
   Optical transport networks controlled by a GMPLS-based control plane 
   enable today∆s network operators to offer valuable new services. With 
   the completion of a number of GMPLS signaling and routing standards 
   and the availability of products implementing them, providers are now 
   looking at ways to enable additional features such as shared-mesh 
   restoration. This document presents the results of a serious attempt 
   to systematically gather and collate carrier inputs on strategies for 
   shared-mesh restoration and the associated issues. The survey results 
   are presented in aggregate form to provide an overview of carrier 
   thinking, while retaining specific carrier response confidentiality. 
   The goal is to highlight areas of carrier concerns, and identify 
   specific work items to focus on and facilitate further discussion.

1.   Introduction 
    
   The CCAMP WG has recently completed (or nearly completed) a series of 
   GMPLS standards, ranging from signaling and routing protocol 
   specifications for the IP-control of non-packet networks 
   (specifically, optical transport networks)(e.g. [3],[4],[5],[6],[7]) 
   to the development of protection and restoration terminology, 
   analysis, and functional documents (e.g. [8],[9],[10]).  
    
   These documents have provided a good foundation for further work in 
   the area, especially given that carriers are beginning now to think 
   seriously about how they will use the GMPLS control plane to enable 
   new and/or advanced services within their networks. This will provide 
   efficiencies for carriers, while providing customers with the same 
   level of service as provided today by less efficient (or more 
   expensive) means. 
    
   One key area that carriers have looked at is shared mesh restoration 
   and its associated issues. This subject while providing opportunities 
   for resource efficiency also requires carriers to be vigilant about 
   how they will meet various performance guarantees.  In that context, 
   several areas of work still need to be addressed within the CCAMP WG 
   to develop interoperable, standards-based solutions that carriers can 
   embrace.

   This document presents the collated results from a survey of several 
   major international carriers from the US, Europe and Japan, conducted 
   over the last 5 months. The goal of the survey was to systematically 
   collect carrier inputs in key areas related to control plane 
   operation and shared mesh restoration, and highlight areas for 
   further work by the CCAMP WG. This is to enable the CCAMP WG to 
   pursue ongoing and further work in this area that is focused towards 
   addressing the identified carrier requirements.  The rest of the 
   document details various aspects of this survey. 
    
   The remainder of the document is organized as follows. In Section 3, 
   we provide a brief overview of the survey and its methodology, while 
   in Section 5 we present the aggregated results of the survey. We 
   conclude in Section 6. 
    
    
2.   Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2]. 
    
    
3.   Survey Overview and Methodology 
    
   The survey consisted of nine questions directed at various aspects of 
   shared mesh restoration in carrier transport networks, and a sample 
   is shown in Section Appendix A. It was circulated to operations and 
   network planning groups at several major international carriers, and 
   the received responses collated into six major tables that are 
   presented in Section 5.  
    
   The collation was done simply to preserve carrier anonymity. 
    
    
4.   Acknowledgements 
    
   We would like to thank the carriers that responded to this survey, 
   some who wished to remain anonymous.  In particular, we would like to 
   acknowledge the participation in alphabetical order of British 
   Telecom, Global Crossing, Japan Telecom, and NTT Communications. 
    
   We would also like to ask carriers whom we did not have the 
   opportunity to contact, to participate in this survey so that their 
   inputs can be included in subsequent versions of this document.

5.   Survey Results 
    
   In this section, we present the aggregated results from the carrier 
   survey, under six headings. 
    
   Please note that throughout, 5 represents the most critical 
   concern/attribute, while 1 represents the least important 
   concern/attribute. 
    
5.1     Key Concerns with a GMPLS-based Control Plane 
    
   The first question sought to get an understanding of some of the 
   areas in which carriers have concerns when thinking of deploying a 
   GMPLS-based control plane. These included the reliability of the 
   control plane (its software and implementation), the speed with which 
   one could communicate over the control plane, the capability of the 
   control plane to integrate with existing NMSs, and the carrier view 
   of the maturity of the vendor offering. 
    
   Table I. Carrier concerns about an IP-based control plane, such as 
   GMPLS.

                                          1      2      3      4      5

      d. Maturity of vendor offering    [  ]   [  ]   [  ]   [ 4]   [ 3] 
    
5.2    Plans for Implementing Shared-Mesh Restoration  
    
   The goal here was to evaluate the timeframes in which carriers were 
   looking to implement shared mesh restoration using a GMPLS-based 
   control plane. This would impact the time available to develop 
   advanced features of the control plane within CCAMP, and also provide 
   insight into why (or why not) the carriers would adopt a GMPLS-based 
   control plane (as seen later). 
    
   It is evident from Table II, that there are plans to implement shared 
   mesh restoration in carrier networks in the next 2-3 years.

5.3    Attributes Key to the Adoption of Shared-Mesh Restoration 
    
   This question was designed simply to assess which attributes of 
   shared mesh restoration were key to a carrier adopting/implementing 
   it.

5.4    Recovery Speed Required 
    
   This question was designed to assess the ranges of recovery speeds 
   carriers deemed appropriate.

   For some applications, 50ms is required. For others a business case 
   can be made for longer duration restorals. Closer the duct the faster 
   in general, closer the applications the slower in general. 
    
5.5    Value of Recovery Speed for Key Applications 
    
   In shared mesh restoration and other restoration scenarios, the speed 
   of recovery is often an important parameter. The question below was 
   designed to assess how important carriers thought recovery speed was 
   for the different types of traffic carried on their networks. As 
   might be expected, TDM voice, VoIP, VoD, and business traffic were 
   the primary applications judged to require quick recovery speeds.

5.6    View on Current Signaling-based Solutions 
    
   A number of mechanisms may be used to perform notification of faults 
   and subsequent recovery actions. The key is to provide scalable ways 
   of disseminating failure information in the network. The question 
   below was designed to assess carrier thinking in this area. 
    
   As can be seen from Table VI, carriers surveyed uniformly agree that 
   hard bounds on recovery time are very important, and that some 
   aspects of signaling such as scalability and potential signaling 
   storms are areas of concern.

   Note: For the purposes of this survey, we define transport networks 
   that implement shared-mesh restoration as follows. In such networks, 
   the working paths are protected by shared protection resources. As an 
   example, a protection path can protect two working paths and be used 
   to restore traffic when either of the working wavelengths fails. In 
   other cases of shared-mesh restoration, a carrier allows extra-
   traffic between endpoints other than the source-destination of a 
   protection path.        
   Thus a protection path cannot be cross-connected until after the 
   specific failure has occurred. 
    
    
   5. What are you plans for implementing shared-mesh restoration in 
   your optical transport network? 
    
      a. Already implemented                    [  ]

      e. Have no current plans to implement it  [  ]
