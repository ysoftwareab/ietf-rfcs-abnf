Internet-Draft    Sieve Notification Mechanism: mailto     December 2005


1.  Introduction

1.1  Overview

   The [Notify] extension to the [Sieve] mail filtering language is a
   framework for providing notifications by employing URIs to specify
   the notification mechanism.  This document defines how [mailto] URIs
   are used to generate notifications by e-mail.


1.2  Conventions used in this document

   Conventions for notations are as in [Sieve] section 1.1, including
   the use of [Kwds] and the use of [ABNF].
   [[no abnf ref: We don't actually need the ABNF reference...]]

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [Kwds].

Internet-Draft    Sieve Notification Mechanism: mailto     December 2005


2.  Definition

   The mailto mechanism results in the sending of a new email message (a
   "notification message") to notify a recipient about a "triggering
   message".

2.1  Notify tag ":method"

   The mailto notification mechanism uses standard mailto URIs as
   specified in [mailto].  URI parameters with hname "from", "subject"
   and "received" are ignored if specified; all other parameters are
   accepted.

   [[Barry ignored: Should we ignore them, or should their presence be
   an error?]]

2.2  Notify tag ":id"

   The :id tag has no special meaning for this notification mechanism,
   and this specification puts no restriction on its use.

2.3  Notify tag ":priority"

   The :priority tag has no special meaning for this notification
   mechanism, and this specification puts no restriction on its use.
   Implementations MAY use the value of :priority to set a priority or
   importance indication on the notification message.

2.4  Notify tag ":message"

   o  The "From:" header field and the envelope sender of the
      notification message are set to the envelope "to" field from the
      triggering message, as used by Sieve.

      [[Barry from: It might be better in some cases for the
      notification to "come from" the sender of the triggering message.
      In other cases it might be better for all notifications to come
      from the "mail system".  I think we should define a way to specify
      the behaviour here, perhaps with a new notify tag.]]

      [[Barry sender: Should we also provide a mapping or setting for
      the "Sender:" header field?]]

   o  The "To:" header field and the envelope recipient(s) of the
      notification message are set to the address(es) specified in URI
      (including any URI parameters where the hname is "to").

      [[Barry to: I'd like some way to specify that the To: header



Leiba & Haardt            Expires June 10, 2006                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    Sieve Notification Mechanism: mailto     December 2005


      should be retained from the triggering message.  In fact, I'd like
      a way to say that ALL headers be retained.]]

   o  The "Received:" headers from the triggering message are retained
      in the notification message, as these may help detect and prevent
      mail loops.

   o  The "Subject:" header of the notification message contains the
      value defined by the :message notify tag, as described in
      [Notify].  If there is no :message tag, the subject is retained
      from the triggering message.  Note that Sieve variables can be
      used to advantage here, as shown in the example in Section 3.

   o  All other header fields of the notification message either are as
      specified in the URI, or have implementation-specific values;
      their values are not defined here.

   o  If the mailto URI contains a "body" parameter, the value of that
      parameter is used as the body of the notification message.  If
      there is no "body" parameter, the body of the notification message
      is empty.

      [[Barry body: I'd like some way to specify that the body contain
      the body of the triggering message.]]


2.5  Other Definitions

   Because the receipt of an email message is generating another email
   message, implementations MUST take steps to avoid mail loops.

   [[Barry loops: We should say more about this...]]

   [[comment 1: Mailto URIs focus on the message, not its submission.
   There is no way to specify envelope parameters, require encryption or
   authentication.  Sure enough there is more than SMTP, so mailto is
   fine not to address this specific transport, but should we ever need
   more, it can not be specified as URI parameter, because there is no
   room in its namespace.]]

   [[comment 2: Michael tried to get documentation on SMTP-SMS gateways,
   but everybody operating one keeps the specification like a precious
   secret.  From experiments made some years ago, we know some gateways
   ignore all messages with empty envelope senders, some do not
   implement MIME and some ignore the body.  Using empty envelope
   senders to avoid loops is not possible and it would not allow to send
   notifications about bounces.]]

   Triggering message (received by recipient@example.org):

      Received: from mail.example.com by mail.example.org
        for <recipient@example.org>; Wed, 7 Dec 2005 05:08:02 -0500

      Subject: [Knitting] A new sweater

      I just finished a great new sweater!


   Sieve script (run on behalf of recipient@example.org):

      require ["notify", "variables"];

      if header :contains "list-id" "knitting.example.com" {
        if header :matches "Subject" "[*] *" {
          notify :method "mailto:0123456789@sms.example.net"
                 :message "From ${1} list: ${2}"
                 :priority "3";
        }
      }


   Notification message:

      Received: from mail.example.com by mail.example.org
        for <recipient@example.org>; Wed, 7 Dec 2005 05:08:02 -0500
      Received: from hobbies.example.com by mail.example.com
        for <knitting@example.com>; Wed, 7 Dec 2005 02:00:26 -0800

Internet-Draft    Sieve Notification Mechanism: mailto     December 2005


   Note that:

   o  Fields such as "Message-ID" and "Date" were generated afresh for
      the notification message, and do not relate to the triggering
      message.

   o  Additional "Received:" headers will be added to the notification
      message in transit; the ones shown were copied from the triggering
      message.

   o  If this message should appear at the mail.example.org server
      again, the server can use the presence of a "mail.example.org"
      received line to avoid sending another notification.

4.  Internationalization Considerations

Internet-Draft    Sieve Notification Mechanism: mailto     December 2005


5.  Security Considerations

   Sending a notification is comparable with forwarding mail to the
   notification recipient.  Care must be taken when forwarding mail
   automatically, to ensure that confidential information is not sent
   into an insecure environment.

   The automated sending of email messages exposes the system to mail
   loops, which can cause operational problems.  Implementations of this
   specification MUST protect themselves against mail loops.

   Additional security considerations are discussed in [Sieve] and in
   [Notify].

   [[IANA to-do: What do we need to do to actually get this set up with
   IANA?]]
   The following template specifies the IANA registration of the Sieve
   notification mechanism specified in this document:
