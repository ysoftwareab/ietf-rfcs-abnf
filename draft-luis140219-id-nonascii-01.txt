              Allow non-ASCII characters in Internet-Drafts
                     draft-luis140219-id-nonascii-01

Abstract

   RFC 7997 allowed non-ASCII characters in RFCs.  This document updates
   RFC 2026, removing from it the requirement that Internet-Drafts be
   fully in ASCII.  This document also updates RFC 5657 and RFC 7997 to
   note the allowance of non-ASCII characters in Internet-Drafts.

   [[RFC-Editor: please replace the second character of my surname by
   U+00E2 when publishing as RFC in the header and in all pages.
   Non-ASCII characters are allowed in RFCs as per RFC 7997.]]

Status of This Memo

   This Internet-Draft is submitted in full conformance with the
   provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  Note that other groups may also distribute
   working documents as Internet-Drafts.  The list of current Internet-
   Drafts is at http://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/current/.

   Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
   and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
   time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference
   material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

   This Internet-Draft will expire on December 14, 2017.

1. Introduction

   RFC 7997 allows international characters in RFCs.  This document
   allows non-ASCII characters in Internet-Drafts.

   [[RFC-Editor: This document, with an intended status of Best Current
   Practice, normatively references RFC 7997, an Informational RFC,
   being that reference a downref.  This document needs to be a Best
   Current Practice because it updates BCP 9/RFC 2026, and the downref
   makes sense because RFC 7997 describes the rules for using non-ASCII
   characters and therefore is effectively part of this document because
   of the requirement in the second paragraph of Section 2. Please refer
   to BCP 97 (RFC 3967, RFC 4897, RFC 8067) for the downref
   guidelines.]]

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119,
   RFC8174].

2. Removal of the ASCII requirement for Internet-Drafts

   Internet-Drafts posted after dd mmmm yyyy [[RFC-Editor: please put
   here the date when this document is published as RFC]] use
   UTF-8 [RFC3629] as their character encoding.

   The use of non-ASCII characters in Internet-Drafts MUST follow the
   rules of [RFC7997].

2.1. Updates to RFC 2026

   RFC 7997 does not update RFC 2026 and is Informational.  This
   document makes the action of RFC 7997 normative, by replacing "ASCII"
   with "UTF-8" and by replacing the reference to the ASCII standard
   (X3.4-1986, reference [2] in RFC 2026) with a reference to the UTF-8
   standard (RFC 3629).

2.2. Updates to RFC 5657

   The first paragraph of Section 3 of RFC 5657 currently reads:

Internet-Draft   Non-ASCII Characters in Internet-Drafts       June 2017

   """
   The format of implementation and interoperability reports MUST be
   ASCII text with line breaks for readability.  As with Internet-
   Drafts, no 8-bit characters are currently allowed.  It is acceptable,
   but not necessary, for a report to be formatted as an Internet-Draft.
   """

   It should read:

   """
   The format of implementation and interoperability reports MUST be
   UTF-8 [RFC3629] text with line breaks for readability.  It is
   acceptable, but not necessary, for a report to be formatted as an
   Internet-Draft.
   """

   The normative references section of RFC 5657 should have a reference
   to RFC 3629.

2.3. Updates to RFC 7997

   RFC 7997 is updated to note that non-ASCII characters are now allowed
   in Internet-Drafts.

2.4. Action to be taken

   The draft submission tool (https://datatracker.ietf.org/submit/) must
   be updated to allow non-ASCII characters and [IDGUIDE] must be
   updated.

   The penultimate paragraph of Section 6 of [IDGUIDE] currently reads:
   """
   I-Ds must be in ASCII. No 8-bit characters are allowed. If you need
   to include code points, one suggestion is to use the Unicode
   convention: U+XXXX, where X is a hexadecimal digit.
   """

   It must be replaced by the phrase "I-Ds must be in UTF-8 [RFC3629].".

   The remaining occurrences of "ASCII" in [IDGUIDE] are to be replaced
   with "UTF-8". A reference to [RFC3629] must be added to
   Section 11 of [IDGUIDE]. The references to RFC 3979 and RFC 4879 must
   be replaced with a reference to RFC 8179, as RFC 3979 and RFC 4879
   are obsoleted by RFC 8179.

3. Security Considerations

   The security considerations of this document are only those of
   [RFC7997].
