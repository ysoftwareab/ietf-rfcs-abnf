1.  Introduction

   BGP [RFC4271] speakers have many default settings which need to be
   revisited as part of improving the routing ecosystem.  There is a
   need to provide guidance to BGP implementors for the default
   behaviors of a well functioning internet ecosystem.  Routing leaks
   [I-D.ietf-idr-route-leak-detection-mitigation] are part of the
   problem, but software defects and operator misconfigurations are just
   a few of the attacks on internet stability we aim to address.

   Usually BGP speakers accept all routes from a configured peer or
   neighbor.  This practice dates back to the early days of internet
   protocols in being very permissive in offering routing information to
   allow all networks to reach each other.  With the core of the
   internet becoming more densely interconnected the risk of a
   misbehaving edge device or BGP speaking customer poses signficiant
   risks to the reachability of critical services.

   This proposal intends to solve this situation by requiring the
   explicit configuration of BGP policy for any non-iBGP speaking
   session such as customers, peers or confederation boundaries.  When
   this solution is implemented, devices will no longer pass routes
   without explicit policy.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Solution Requirements

   The following requirements apply to the solution described in this
   document:

   o  Software MUST mark any routes from an eBGP peer as 'invalid' in
      the Adj-RIB-In, if no explicit policy was configured.

   o  Software MUST NOT advertise any routes to an eBGP peer without an
      operator configuring a policy.

   o  Software MUST NOT require a configuration directive to operate in
      this mode.

   o  Software MUST provide protection from internal failures preventing
      the advertisement and acceptance of routes.

   o  Software MAY provide a configuration option to disable this
      security capability.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document addresses the basic security posture of a BGP speaking
   device within a network.  Operators have a need for implementors to
   address the problem through a behavior change to mitigate against
   possible attacks from a permissive security posture.  Attacks and
   inadvertent advertisements cause business impact necessitating this
   default behavior.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
