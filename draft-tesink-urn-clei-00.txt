Abstract

   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace
   [RFC3406] that is managed by Telcordia Technologies, Inc., as the
   maintenance agent for ANSI T1.213 [T1.213], for the assignment of the
   CLEI Code, for usage within messages standardized by ANSI.  The CLEI
   code is a globally unique, ten-character alphanumeric intelligent
   code assigned by Telcordia Technologies at the request of equipment
   suppliers. The CLEI code identifies communications equipment by
   specifying product type and features. There is a one-to-one
   relationship between a CLEI Code and supplier∆s Product ID
   (Manufacturer's name, part number along with it's version number).

1.  Introduction

   Many circuit cards used in the global telecommunications network have
   a CLEI Code assigned and have a bar code or two-dimensional symbol on
   a label affixed to the front of that circuit card.  Service providers
   utilize the CLEI Code to:


    o   Track inventory, both working and spare

    o   Logistics (movement of circuit cards, along with the serial
        number)

    o   Provision equipment

    o   Maintain asset records (accounting information)

   The goal of the CLEI namespace is to ensure the stability and
   uniqueness of the names of various (specific) items that are used
   within the messages exchanged between equipment used in the global
   telecommunications network.

   The assigned maintenance agent for the CLEI Code, Telcordia
   Technologies, is responsible for assigning certain equipment and
   other identifiers (e.g., location, manufacturer/supplier) for the
   telecommunications industry.  The code assignment process identifies
   the structure and intelligence of the CLEI Code to identify the
   circuit card's form, fit, functions, and features. Equipment may
   exist in multiple physical locations with the exact same form, fit,
   functions, and features and will have the same CLEI Code if their
   Product ID is the same.

   Declaration of syntactic structures:

      The structure of the Namespace Specific String is a flat space of
      10 characters as defined in [T1.213][T1.213a].

   Relevant ancillary Documentation:

      [T1.213] and [T1.213a].

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      Identifiers are assigned by Telcordia URN registration that
      guarantees Uniqueness for items with different form, fit,
      functions, and features.  This is simply achieved by keeping track
      of already assigned names and comparing all new proposed names to
      the database ones.  If the name already exists a new one is
      created per the rules of the process. See [T1.213][T1.213a] for
      assignment examples.

   Identifiers persistence considerations:

      The process defined by ANSI and the CLEI maintenance agent ensure
      the binding between the name and its resource is permanent, and
      that names are not reassigned.

   Process of identifiers assignment:

      A CLEI Code is an intelligent code that consists of 10
      alphanumeric characters with 4 data elements.  The first data
      element is considered the basic code with the first 2 characters
      indicating the technology or equipment type with the third and
      fourth characters denoting the functional sub-category.  The
      second data element represents the features and its three
      characters denote functional capabilities or changes. The third
      data element has one character and denotes a reference to
      manufacturer, system ID, specification or drawing. The fourth data
      element consists of two characters and contains complementary
      data.  These two characters provide a means of differentiating or
      providing uniqueness between the eight character CLEI Codes by
      identifying the manufacturing vintage of the product. Names are
      assigned via procedures defined in [GR485].

   Process for identifier resolution:

Internet Draft       <draft-tesink-urn-clei-00.txt>           12/31/2004


      Telcordia URNs are resolved via Telcordia resolvers run under
      Telcordia responsibility. For further information see
      www.commonlanguage.com.

   Rules for lexical equivalence:

      Lexical equivalence of two CLEI URN namespace specific strings is
      defined as an exact, case-insensitive string match.  CLEI codes
      are assigned in a case-insensitive fashion, so that there will not
      be two CLEI codes that differ only in case.  See [T1.213] and
      [T1.213a] for further information.

   Conformance with URN syntax:

      No special consideration.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.

   Scope:

      Global.


3.  Examples

   The following three examples are based on the examples provided in
   [T1.213a], and correspond with three different sets of features by
   three different manufacturers (Nortel Networks, Lear and Lucent
   Technologies) producing "D4CE" (a particular D4 channel bank type)
   equipment. The fourth example refers to a SONET power unit convertor
   of Alcatel.

      URN:CLEI:D4CE4248AA
      URN:CLEI:D4CE363PAB
      URN:CLEI:SNPWBBC7AA



4.  Namespace and Community Considerations

   CLEI codes have historically been used in a variety of communications
   equipment (see examples above and [213a]). There are circumstances
   where entities with CLEI codes need to be managed or exposed in a
   larger context, such as the general Internet. In these cases, the use
   of the CLEI URN namespace will provide general interoperability

   benefits to the Internet at large, as well as to specific internets.


5.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

   It is noted however that attempting to resolve a Telcordia URN
   through a resolver other than the one provided by Telcordia is not
   considered authoritative.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has registered formal URN namespace ????, to Telcordia
   within the IANA registry of URN NIDs.

7.  Intellectual Property

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
