    A YANG Model for Network and VPN Service Performance Monitoring
                draft-ietf-opsawg-yang-vpn-service-pm-00

Abstract

   The data model defined in RFC8345 introduces vertical layering
   relationships between networks that can be augmented to cover
   network/service topologies.  This document defines a YANG model for
   both Network Performance Monitoring and VPN Service Performance
   Monitoring that can be used to monitor and manage network performance
   on the topology at higher layer or the service topology between VPN
   sites.

   This document does not define metrics for network performance or
   mechanisms for measuring network performance.  The YANG model defined
   in this document is designed as an augmentation to the network
   topology YANG model defined in RFC 8345 and draws on relevant YANG
   types defined in RFC 6991, RFC 8299, RFC 8345, and RFC 8532.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC4176] provides a framework for L3VPN operations and management
   and specifies that performance management is required after service
   configuration.  This document defines a YANG Model for both network
   performance monitoring and VPN service performance monitoring that
   can be used to monitor and manage network performance on the topology
   level or the service topology between VPN sites.

   This document does not introduce new metrics for network performance
   or mechanisms for measuring network performance, but uses the
   existing mechanisms and statistics to show the performance monitoring
   statistics at the network and service layers.  The YANG model defined
   in this document is designed as an augmentation to the network
   topology YANG model defined in [RFC8345] and draws on relevant YANG
   types defined in [RFC6991], [RFC8299], [RFC8345], and [RFC8532].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

3.  Network and VPN Service Performance Monitoring Model Usage

   Models are key for automatic management operations.  According to
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-model-automation-framework] , together with service
   and network models, performance measurement telemetry model can
   monitor network performance to meet specific service SLA
   requirements.  The model defined in this document is to derive VPN or
   network level performance data based on lower-level data collected
   via monitoring counters in the devices.

                     Figure 1: Reference Architecture

   As shown in Figure 1 , the network and VPN service performance
   monitoring model can be used to expose some performance information
   to the above layer.  The information can be used by the orchestrator
   to subscribe to performance data.  The controller will then notify
   the orchestrator of corresponding parameter changes.

   Before using the Network and VPN Service PM Model, the mapping
   between the VPN Service topology and the underlying physical network
   has been setup, and the performance monitoring data per link in the
   underlying network can be collected using network performance
   measurement method such as MPLS Loss and Delay Measurement [RFC6374].

   The performance monitoring information reflecting the quality of the
   Network or VPN service such as end to end network performance data
   between source node and destination node in the network or between
   VPN sites can be aggregated or calculated using, for example, PCEP
   solution [RFC8233] [RFC7471] [RFC8570] [RFC8571] or LMAP [RFC8194].

   The measurement interval and report interval associated with these
   performance data usually depends on configuration parameters.

3.1.  Retrieval via Pub/Sub Mechanism

   Some applications such as service-assurance applications, which must
   maintain a continuous view of operational data and state, can use
   subscription model [RFC8641] to subscribe to the specific Network

   performance data or VPN service performance data they are interested
   in, at the data source.

   The data source can then use the Network and VPN service assurance
   model defined in this document and the YANG Push model [RFC8641] to
   distribute specific telemetry data to target recipients.

3.2.  On demand Retrieval via RPC Model

   To obtain a snapshot of a large amount of performance data from a
   network element (including network controllers), service-assurance
   applications may use polling-based methods such as RPC model to fetch
   performance data on demand.

4.  Description of the Data Model

   This document defines the YANG module "ietf-network-vpn-pm", which is
   an augmentation to the "ietf-network" and "ietf-network-topology".

   The performance monitoring data is augmented to service topology as
   shown in Figure 2.

4.1.  Layering Relationship Between Multiple Layers of Topology

   [RFC8345] defines a YANG [RFC7950] data model for network/service
   topologies and inventories.  The service topology described in
   [RFC8345] includes the virtual topology for a service layer above
   Layer 1 (L1), Layer 2 (L2), and Layer 3 (L3).  This service topology
   has the generic topology elements of node, link, and terminating
   point.  One typical example of a service topology is described in
   Figure 3 of [RFC8345]: two VPN service topologies instantiated over a
   common L3 topology.  Each VPN service topology is mapped onto a
   subset of nodes from the common L3 topology.

   Figure 3 illustrates an example of a topology mapping between the VPN
   service topology and an underlying network:

    Figure 3: Example of topology mapping between VPN Service Topo and
                            Underlying network

   As shown in Figure 3, two VPN services topologies are both built on
   top of one common underlying physical network:

   o  VPN-SVC 1: supporting "hub-spoke" communications for Customer 1
      connecting the customer's access at 3 sites.  Site-1A, Site-1B,
      and Site-1C are connected to PEs that are mapped to nodes 1, 2,
      and 3 in the underlying physical network.
      Site-1 A plays the role of hub while Site-2 B and C plays the role
      of spoke.

   o  VPN-SVC 2: supporting "hub-spoke disjoint" communications for
      Customer 2 connecting the customer's access at 3 sites.  Site-2A,
      Site-2B, and Site-2C are connected to PEs that are mapped to nodes
      4, 5, and 6 in the underlying physical network.

      Site-2 A and B play the role of hub while Site-2 C plays the role
      of spoke.

4.2.  Network Level

   For network performance monitoring, the attributes of "Network Level"
   that defined in [RFC8345] do not need to be extended.

   For VPN service performance monitoring, this document defines some
   new network service type: "L3VPN, L2VPN".  When a network topology
   data instance contains the L3VPN or L2VPN network type, it represents
   an VPN instance that can perform performance monitoring.

   This model defines only the following minimal set of Network level
   network topology attributes:

   o  "vpn-id": Refers to an identifier of VPN service
      (e.g.,L3NM[I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm]).  This identifier allows to
      correlate the performance status with the network service
      configuration.

   o  "vpn-topo": The type of VPN service topology, this model supports
      "any-to-any", "Hub and Spoke" (where Hubs can exchange traffic),
      and "Hub and Spoke disjoint" (where Hubs cannot exchange traffic).
      [RFC8299] defines a YANG model for L3VPN Service Delivery.  Three
      types of VPN service topologies are supported in : "any to any",
      "hub and spoke", and "hub and spoke disjoint".  These VPN topology
      types can be used to describe how VPN sites communicate with each
      other.

4.3.  Node Level

   For network performance monitoring, the attributes of "Node Level"
   that defined in [RFC8345] do not need to be extended.

   For VPN service performance monitoring, this model defines only the
   following minimal set of Node level network topology attributes:

   o  "node-type" (Attribute): Indicates the type of the node, such as
      PE or ASBR.  This "node-type" can be used to report performance
      metric between any two nodes each with specific node-type.

   o  "site-id" (Constraint): Uniquely identifies the site within the
      overall network infrastructure.

   o  "site-role" (Constraint): Defines the role of the site in a
      particular VPN topology.

   o  "vpn-summary-statistics": IPv4 statistics, and IPv6 statistics
      have been specified separately.  And MAC statistics could be
      extended for L2VPN.

               Figure 5: Node Level View of the hierarchies

4.4.  Link and Termination Point Level

   The link nodes are classified into two types: one is topology link
   defined in [RFC8345], and the other is abstract link of a VPN between
   PEs.

   The performance data of the link is a collection of counters that
   report the performance status.  The data for the topology link can be
   based on BGP-LS [RFC8571].  The statistics of the VPN abstract links
   can be collected based on VPN OAM mechanisms, e.g.  TWAMP etc.
   Alternatively, the data can base on the underlay technology OAM
   mechanism, for example, GRE tunnel OAM.

   For the nodes of the link in the figure, this module defines the
   following minimal set of link level performance attributes:

   o  "link-type": Indicates the abstract link of a VPN, such as GRE or
      IP-in-IP.  The leaf refers to an identifier of VPN Common
      "underlay-transport" [I-D.ietf-opsawg-vpn-common], which describes
      the transport technology to carry the traffic of the VPN service.

   o  Percentile parameters: The module supports reporting delay and
      jitter metric by percentile values.  By default, low percentile
      (10th percentile), mid percentile (50th percentile), high
      percentile (90th percentile) are used.  Setting a percentile into
      0.00 indicates the client is not interested in receiving
      particular percentile.  If all percentile nodes are set to 0.00,
      this represents that no percentile related nodes will be reported
      for a given performance metric (e.g. one-way delay, one-way delay
      variation) and only peak/min values will be reported.  For
      example, a client can inform the server that it is interested in
      receiving only high percentiles.  Then for a given link, at a
      given "reference-time" "measurement-interval", the high-delay-
      percentile and high-jitter-percentile will be reported.

   o  Loss Statistics: A set of loss statistics attributes that are used
      to measure end to end loss between VPN sites or between any two
      network nodes.  The exact loss value or the loss percentage can be
      reported.

   o  Delay Statistics: A set of delay statistics attributes that are
      used to measure end to end latency between VPN sites or between
      any two network nodes.  The peak/min values or percentile values
      can be reported.

   o  Jitter Statistics: A set of IP Packet Delay Variation [RFC3393]
      statistics attributes that are used to measure end to end jitter
      between VPN sites or between any two network nodes.  The peak/min
      values or percentile values can be reported.

   For the nodes of "termination points" in the figure, the module
   defines the following minimal set of statistics:

   o  Inbound statistics: A set of inbound statistics attributes that
      are used to measure the inbound statistics of the termination
      point, such as received packets, received packets with errors,
      etc.

   o  Outbound statistics: A set of outbound statistics attributes that
      are used to measure the outbound statistics of the termination

      point, such as sent packets, packets that could not be sent due to
      errors, etc.

5.  Example of I2RS Pub/Sub Retrieval

   This example shows the way for a client to subscribe for the
   Performance monitoring information between node A and node B in the
   L3 network topology built on top of the underlying network . The
   performance monitoring parameter that the client is interested in is
   end to end loss attribute.

   performance data on demand, e.g., the client requests "packet-loss-
   count" between PE1 in site 1 and PE2 in site 2 belonging to the same
   VPN1.

8.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules defined in this document MAY be accessed via the
   RESTCONF protocol [RFC8040] or NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The
   lowest RESTCONF or NETCONF layer requires that the transport-layer
   protocol provides both data integrity and confidentiality, see
   Section 2 in [RFC8040] and [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is
   the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH)[RFC6242] .  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/svc-topo:svc-telemetry-attributes

   o  /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/svc-topo:node-attributes

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to register the following URI in the "ns"
   subregistry within the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-network-vpn-pm
      Registrant Contact: The IESG.
      XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document requests IANA to register the following YANG module in
   the "YANG Module Names" subregistry [RFC6020] within the "YANG
   Parameters" registry.
