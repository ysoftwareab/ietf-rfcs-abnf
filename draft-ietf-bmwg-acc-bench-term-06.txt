1. Introduction

   Routers in an operational network are simultaneously configured with 
   multiple protocols and security policies while forwarding traffic and 
   being managed.  To accurately benchmark a router for deployment it is 
   necessary to test that router in operational conditions by 
   simultaneously configuring and scaling network protocols and security 
   policies, forwarding traffic, and managing the device.  It is helpful 
   to accelerate these network operational conditions so that the 
   router under test can be benchmarked with faster test duration.  
   Testing a router in accelerated network conditions is known as 
   Accelerated Stress Testing.  

   This document provides the Terminology for performing Stress 
   Benchmarking of networking devices.  The three phases of the Stress 
   Test: Startup, Instability and Recovery are defined along with the
   benchmark and configuration terms associated with the each phase.
   Benchmarks for stress testing are defined using the Aggregate 
   Forwarding Rate and control plane Session Count during each phase 
   of the test.  Also defined are the Benchmark Planes fundamental to 
   stress testing configuration, setup and measurement.  These are 
   the Control Plane, Data Plane, Management Plane and Security Plane  
   For each plane, the Configuration Set, Startup Conditions, and 
   Instability Conditions are defined.  White Box benchmarks are 
   provided in Appendix 1 for additional DUT behavior measurements.
   The terminology is to be used with the companion methodology 
   document [4].  The sequence of phases, actions, and benchmarks
   are shown in Table 1.

2.  Existing definitions

   RFC 1242 "Benchmarking Terminology for Network Interconnect 
   Devices" and RFC 2285 "Benchmarking Terminology for LAN Switching 
   Devices" should be consulted before attempting to make use of this 
   document. For the sake of clarity and continuity this RFC adopts 
   the template for definitions set out in Section 2 of RFC 1242.  
   Definitions are indexed and grouped together in sections for ease 
   of reference.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [5].  RFC 2119 defines the use of these key words to help make the
   intent of standards track documents as clear as possible.  While this
   document uses these keywords, this document is not a standards track
   document.

INTERNET-DRAFT Terminology for Accelerated Stress Benchmarking  July 2005

      Discussion:
	A key component of the Accelerated Stress Benchmarking is the 
	Management Plane to assess manageability of the router 
	under stress.  The Management Plane defines the Configuration, 
	Startup Conditions, and Instability Conditions of the 
        management protocols and features.  The Management Plane 
        includes SNMP, Logging/Debug, Statistics Collection, and 
        management configuration sessions such as telnet, SSH, and 
        serial console.  SNMP Gets SHOULD be performed continuously.  
        Management configuration sessions should be open 
        simultaneously and be repeatedly open and closed.  Open 
        management sessions should have valid and invalid 
        configuration and show commands entered.

        Conditions, and Instability Conditions of the security 
        features and protocols.  The Security Plane includes the 
        ACLs, Firewall, Secure Protocols, and User Login.  Tunnels 
        for those such as IPsec should be established and flapped.  
        Policies for Firewalls and ACLs should be repeatedly added 
        and removed from the configuration via telnet, SSH, or 
        serial management sessions.

   3.3 Startup

   3.3.1 Startup Phase

     Definition
	The portion of the benchmarking test in which the
	Startup Conditions are generated with the DUT.  This 
	begins with the attempt to establish the first session 
	and ends when the last Control Plane session is 
	established.

     Discussion:
        The Startup Phase is the first Phase of the benchmarking 
        test preceding the Instability Phase and Recovery Phase.  
        It is specified by the Configuration Sets and Startup 
        Conditions for each Benchmark Plane.  The Startup Phase ends
        and Instability Phase may begin when the Configuration Sets 
        are achieved with the DUT.

     Measurement Units:
	None

     Issues:
	The 'last control plane session is established' may not 
	be a sufficient indicator that steady-state is achieved 
	and Instability Conditions can be applied to begin the 
	Instability Phase.

     See Also:
	Benchmark Plane
	Configuration Sets
	Startup Conditions

   3.3.2 Benchmarks
   3.3.2.1 Stable Aggregate Forwarding Rate

     Definition: 
	Average rate of traffic forwarded by the DUT during the 
	Startup Phase.

      Discussion:
	Stable Aggregate Forwarding Rate is the calculated
	average of the Aggregate Forwarding Rates measured during 
	the Startup Phase.  
 
      Measurement units:
	pps



Poretsky and Rao					        	[Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT Terminology for Accelerated Stress Benchmarking  July 2005

      Issues:
	The act of the DUT establishing the Startup Conditions
	could influence the forwarding rate in certain 
	implementations so that this "baseline" for the 
	remainder of the test is lowered.  The alternative is
	to change the definition of Stable Aggregate 
	Forwarding Rate so that it measured during the Startup 
	Phase, but after Startup Conditions are achieved.  
	The disadvantage of this definition would be that it 
	loses measurement of any impact that establishing 
        Startup  Conditions would have on forwarding rate. When 
	comparing the Startup Aggregate Forwarding Rate benchmark 
	of two devices it is preferred to know the impact
	establishing Startup Conditions has on Forwarding Rate. 
	The definition was therefore selected so that Stable
	Aggregate Forwarding Rate is calculated from measurement 
	samples throughout the entire Startup Phase.

      See Also:
        Startup Phase
        Aggregate Forwarding Rate

   3.3.2.2 Stable Latency

      Definition:
        Average measured latency of traffic forwarded by the DUT 
        during the Startup Phase.

      Discussion:
        Stable Latency is the calculated average Latency during 
	the Startup Phase.  

      Measurement units:
	seconds

      Issues:
	None

      See Also:
        Startup Phase

   3.3.2.3 Stable Session Count

     Definition:
        Total number of control plane sessions/adjacencies
        established and maintained by the DUT during the Startup 
	Phase and prior to Instability Conditions being initiated.

      Discussion:
	This measurement should be made after the Control
	Plane Startup Conditions are applied to the DUT.

      Definition:
  	The router management features enabled for the 
	Accelerated Stress Test.

      Discussion:
        A key component of the Accelerated Stress Test is the Management 	
        Configuration Set to assess manageability of the router under 
        stress.  The Management Configuration Set defines the management 	
        configuration of the DUT.  Features that are part of the 
        Management Configuration Set include Telnet access, SNMP, 
        Logging/Debug, and Statistics Collection, and services such as 
        FTP, as shown in Figure 3. These features should be enabled
        throughout the Stress test. SNMP Gets should be made continuously
        with multiple FTP and Telnet sessions operating simultaneously.
        FTP sessions should be opened and closed at varying intervals
        and get and put files while open.  Telnet sessions should be 
        opened and closed at varying intervals and enter valid and invalid
        show and configuration commands while open.

      Definition:
	Security features and scaling enabled for the Accelerated Stress 
	Test.

      Discussion:
        The Security Plane Configuration Set includes the configuration
        and scaling of ACLs, Firewall, IPsec, and User Access, as shown 
        in Figure 4.  Tunnels should be established and policies 
        configured.  Instability is introduced by flapping tunnels and 
        configuring and removing policies.

   3.4.2.2 Degraded Aggregate Forwarding Rate 

      Definition:
	The reduction in Aggregate Forwarding Rate during the
	Instability Phase.	

      Discussion:
	The Degraded Aggregate Forwarding Rate is calculated 
	for each measurement of the Unstable Aggregate
	Forwarding Rate.  The Degraded Aggregate Forwarding 
	Rate is calculated by subtracting each measurement 
	of the Unstable Aggregate Forwarding Rate from the 
	Stable Aggregate Forwarding Rate, such that

	Degraded Forwarding Rate = 
	Stable Aggregate Forwarding Rate - 
		Unstable Aggregate Forwarding Rate

	Ideally, the Degraded Aggregate Forwarding Rate is zero.

      Definition:
        The average increase in measured packet latency during 
        the Instability Phase compared to the Startup Phase.  

      Discussion:
        Latency SHOULD be measured at a fixed interval during the
        Instability Phase.  Unstable Latency is the difference 
        between Stable Latency and the average Latency measured 
        during the Instability Phase.  It is expected that there
        be an increase in average latency from the Startup Phase
        to the Instability phase, but it is possible that the
        difference be zero.  The Unstable Latency cannot be a
        negative number.

      Definition:
        The difference between the measured Benchmarks of the 
        same DUT over multiple iterations.

      Discussion:
        Ideally, the measured benchmarks should be the same for multiple 
        iterations with the same DUT.  Configuration Sets and Instability 
        Conditions SHOULD be held constant for this benchmark. Whether the 
        DUT can exhibit such predictable and repeatable behavior is an 
        important benchmark in itself.
