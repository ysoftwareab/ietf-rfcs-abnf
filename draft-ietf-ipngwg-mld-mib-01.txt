Abstract

   This document defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   Internet Protocol Version 6 internets.  Specifically, this document
   is the MIB module which defines managed objects for implementations
   of the Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol [MLD].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of five
   major components :
   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [RFC2271].

   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and is described in
      RFC 1155 [RFC1155], RFC 1212 [RFC1212], and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].
      The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902
      [RFC1902], RFC 1903 [RFC1903], and RFC 1904 [RFC1904].

   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
      and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message protocol



draft-ietf-ipngwg-mld-mib-01.txt                                [Page 2]


INTERNET-DRAFT      Multicast Listener Discovery MIB     August 15, 1999


      is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2272
      [RFC2272], and RFC 2274 [RFC2274].

   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [RFC1905].

   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [RFC2273]
      and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
      [RFC2275].



2.1.  Object Definition

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


3.  Overview

   This MIB module contains two tables :


   1. the MLD Interface Table which contains one row for each interface
      on which MLD is enabled.

   2. the MLD Cache Table which contains one row for each IPv6 Multicast
      group for which there are members on a particular interface.


   Both tables are intended to be implemented by hosts and routers.
   Some objects in each table apply to routers only.

5.  Security Considerations

   Certain management information defined in this MIB MAY be considered
   sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore, authentication of
   received SNMP requests and controlled access to management
   information SHOULD be employed in such environments.  The method for
   this authentication is a function of the SNMP Administrative
   Framework, and has not been expanded by this MIB.

   Several objects in this MIB allow write access or provide for row

   creation.  Allowing this support in a non-secure environment can have
   a negative effect on network operations.  It is RECOMMENDED that
   implementers seriously consider whether set operations or row
   creation be allowed without providing, at a minimum, authentication
   of request origin.  It is RECOMMENDED that without such support that
   objects be implemented as read-only.
