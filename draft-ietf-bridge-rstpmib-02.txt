Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.
   In particular, it defines a MIB module for managing the Rapid
   Spanning Tree capability defined by the IEEE P802.1t [802.1t] and
   P802.1w [802.1w] amendments to IEEE Std 802.1D-1998 for bridging
   between Local Area Network (LAN) segments.

   Provisions are made for support of transparent bridging.  Provisions
   are also made so that these objects apply to bridges connected by
   subnetworks other than LAN segments.  This memo also includes a MIB
   module in a manner that is compliant to SMIv2 [RFC2578].

1. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine

   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

2. Overview

   A common device present in many networks is the Bridge.  This device
   is used to connect Local Area Network segments below the network
   layer.  These devices are often known as 'layer 2 switches'.

   There are two major modes defined for this bridging: Source-Route and
   transparent.  Source-Route bridging is described by IEEE 802.5
   [802.5] and is not discussed further in this document.

   The transparent method of bridging is defined by IEEE 802.1D-1998
   [802.1D]  Managed objects for that original specification of
   transparent bridging were defined in RFC 1493 [BRIDGEMIB].

2.1. Scope

   This MIB includes a comprehensive set of managed objects which
   attempts to match the set defined in IEEE P802.1t [802.1t] and
   P802.1w [802.1w].

3. Structure of MIBs

   This document defines additional managed objects for Rapid Spanning
   Tree Protocol defined by IEEE P802.1t and IEEE P802.1w, on top of
   those existing in the original BRIDGE-MIB module defined in
   [BRIDGEMIB]: that MIB module is to be maintained unchanged for
   backwards compatibility.  Section 3.4.1 of the present document
   contains some recommendations regarding usage of objects in the
   original bridge MIB by devices implementing the enhancements defined
   here.


3.1. Structure of RSTP-MIB

   Objects in this MIB are defined as an addition to the dot1dStp group
   in the original bridge MIB [BRIDGE-MIB].  The overall structure is
   shown below:

         dot1dStpPortOperPointToPoint    (w) 6.4.3 operPointToPointMAC

3.4. Relationship to Other MIBs

   As described above, some IEEE 802.1D management objects have not been
   included in this MIB because they overlap with objects in other MIBs
   applicable to a bridge implementing this MIB.  In particular, it is
   assumed that a bridge implementing this MIB will implement the
   original bridge MIB [BRIDGEMIB].

3.4.1. Relation to Original Bridge MIB

   This section defines how objects in the original bridge MIB module
   [BRIDGEMIB] should be represented for devices which implement all the
   MIB modules described in this memo.  Some of the old objects are less
   useful in such devices but must still be implemented for reasons of
   backwards compatibility.

3.4.1.1. The dot1dBase Group

   This mandatory group contains the objects which are applicable to all
   types of bridges.  Interpretation of this group is unchanged.

3.4.1.2. The dot1dStp Group

   This group contains the objects that denote the bridge's state with
   respect to the Spanning Tree Protocol.  If a node does not implement
   the Spanning Tree Protocol, this group will not be implemented.

   In a device supporting the Spanning Tree Algorithm and Protocol
   defined in IEEE 802.1D-1998 Clause 8, interpretation of this group is
   unchanged.

   In a device supporting the Rapid Spanning Tree Algorithm and Protocol
   defined in IEEE 802.1w Clause 17, the interpretation of objects in
   this group is unchanged except for those listed below:

Internet Draft          Bridge MIB extensions 2               March 2002


   dot1dStpPriority
        Definition remains unchanged, but the permissible values are
        changed to 0-61440, in steps of 4096.

   dot1dStpPortPriority
        Definition remains unchanged, but the permissible values are
        changed to 0-240, in steps of 16.

   dot1dStpTimeSinceTopologyChange
        The time since the tcWhile timer for any port on this Bridge was
        non-zero.

   dot1dStpTopChanges
        The number of times that there have been at least one non-zero
        tcWhile timer on this Bridge.

   In a device supporting the 32-bit default Path Costs defined in IEEE
   802.1t Table 8-5, the interpretation of objects in this group is
   unchanged except for the following:

   dot1dStpPortPathCost
        Definition remains unchanged, but the permissible values are
        extended to 1-200,000,000.

3.4.1.3. The dot1dTp Group

   This group contains objects that describe the entity's state with
   respect to transparent bridging.  Interpretation for this group is
   unchanged.

3.4.1.4. The dot1dStatic Group

   This group contains objects that describe the entity's state with
   respect to destination-address filtering.  Interpretation for this
   group is unchanged.

5. Acknowledgments

   This document was produced on behalf of the Bridge MIB Working Group
   in the Operations and Management area of the Internet Engineering
   Task Force.

   The authors wish to thank the members of the Bridge MIB Working Group
   for their comments and suggestions which improved this effort.

6. Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model [USM] and the View-based Access
   Control Model [VACM] is recommended.
