1.  Introduction

   Software bills of material (SBOMs) are descriptions of what software,
   including versioning and dependencies, a device contains.  There are
   different SBOM formats such as Software Package Data Exchange [SPDX]
   or CycloneDX[CycloneDX12].

   This memo specifies means by which SBOMs can be advertised and
   retrieved.

   The mechanisms specified in this document are meant to satisfy
   several use cases:

   *  A network-layer management system retrieving an SBOM from an IoT
      device as part of its ongoing lifecycle.  Such devices may or may
      not have interfaces available to query SBOM information.

   *  An application-layer management system retrieving an SBOM in order
      to evaluate the posture of an application server of some form.
      These application servers may themselves be containers or
      hypervisors.  Discovery of the topology of a server is beyond the
      scope of this memo.

Internet-Draft               Accessing SBOMs                    May 2021


   To satisfy these two key use cases, SBOMs may be found in one of
   three ways:

   *  on devices themselves

   *  on a web site (e.g., via URI)

   *  through some form of out-of-band contact with the supplier.

   In the first case, devices will have interfaces that permit direct
   SBOM retrieval.  Examples of these interfaces might be an HTTP, COAP
   or [OpenC2] endpoint for retrieval.  There may also be private
   interfaces as well.

   In the second case, when a device does not have an appropriate
   interface to retrieve an SBOM, but one is directly available from the
   manufacturer, a URI to that information must be discovered.

   In the third case, a supplier may wish to make an SBOM available
   under certain circumstances, and may need to individually evaluate
   requests.  The result of that evaluation might be the SBOM itself or
   a restricted URL or no access.

   To enable application-layer discovery, this memo defines a well-known
   URI [RFC8615].  Management or orchestration tools can query this
   well-known URI to retrieve a system's SBOM.  Further queries may be
   necessary based on the content and structure of a particular SBOM.

   To enable network-layer discovery, particularly for IOT-based
   devices, an extension to Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) may be
   used[RFC8520].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.1.  Cases Not Addressed

   [ This section to be removed prior to publication ]

   A separate use case may be addressed in future versions of this
   document:

   *  Related to the application layer, software as a service may
      involve multiple backend systems, depending on many factors.  One
      example might be a large cloud-based service that offers

      spreadsheets, email, and document authoring and management.
      Depending on what service is being used, a different set of back
      end services may in turn be invoking different software that
      should be listed.

   The reason why this use case isn't addressed here is that it may be
   better addressed inline within HTML.  Further discussion is required.

1.2.  How This Information Is Used

   SBOMs are used for numerous purposes, including vulnerability
   assessment, license management, and inventory management.  This memo
   provides means for either automated or semi-automated collection of
   that information.  For devices that can output a MUD URL or establish
   a well-known URI, the mechanism may be highly automated.  For devices
   that have a MUD URL in either their documentation or within a QR code
   on a box, the mechanism is semi-automated (someone has to scan the QR
   code or enter the URL).

   Note that SBOMs may change more frequently than access control
   requirements.  A change to software does not necessarily mean a
   change to control channels that are used.  Therefore, it is important
   to retrieve the MUD file as suggested by the manufacturer in the
   cache-validity period.  In many cases, only the SBOM list will have
   been updated.

1.3.  SBOM formats

   There are multiple ways to express an SBOM.  When these are retrieved
   either directly from the device or directly from a web server, tools
   will need to observe the content-type header to determine precisely
   which format is being transmitted.  Because IoT devices in particular
   have limited capabilities, use of a specific Accept: header in HTTP
   or the Accept Option in CoAP is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Instead, backend
   tooling MUST silently discard SBOM information sent with a media type
   that is not understood.

1.4.  Discussion points

   The following is discussion to be removed at time of RFC publication.

   *  Is the model structured correctly?

   *  Are there other retrieval mechanisms that need to be specified?

   *  Do we need to be more specific in how to authenticate and retrieve
      SBOMs?

   *  What are the implications if the MUD URL is an extension in a
      certificate (e.g. an IDevID cert)?

2.  The .well-known/sbom endpoint set

   If a host offers this service, it will offer the RESTful endpoint
   beginning with "{ORIGIN}/.well-known/sbom/base".

3.  The mud-sbom extension model extension

   We now formally define this extension.  This is done in two parts.
   First, the extension name "sbom" is listed in the "extensions" array
   of the MUD file.  N.B., this schema extension is intended to be used
   wherever it might be appropriate (e.g., not just MUD).

   Second, the "mud" container is augmented with a list of SBOM sources.

   This is done as follows:

   module: ietf-mud-sbom

     augment /mud:mud:
       +--rw sbom
          +--rw (sbom-type)?
             +--:(cloud)
             |  +--rw sboms* [version-info]
             |     +--rw version-info    string
             |     +--rw sbom-url?       inet:uri
             +--:(local-well-known)
             |  +--rw local-well-known?   empty
             +--:(contact-info)
             |  +--rw contact-uri         inet:uri
             +--:(openc2)
                +--rw openc2-uri          inet:uri

5.  Examples

   In this example MUD file that uses a cloud service, the Frobinator
   presents a location of the SBOM in a URL.  Note, the ACLs in a MUD
   file are NOT required, although they are a very good idea for IP-
   based devices.  The first MUD file demonstrates how to get the SBOM
   without ACLs, and the second has ACLs.

   At this point, the management system can attempt to retrieve the
   SBOM, and determine which format is in use through the content-type
   header on the response to a GET request.

6.  Security Considerations

   SBOMs provide an inventory of software.  If firmware is available to
   an attacker, the attacker may well already be able to derive this
   very same software inventory.  Manufacturers MAY restrict access to
   SBOM information using appropriate authorization semantics within
   HTTP.  In particular, if a system attempts to retrieve an SBOM via
   HTTP and the client is not authorized, the server MUST produce an
   appropriate error, with instructions on how to register a particular
   client.  One example may be to issue a certificate to the client for
   this purpose after a registration process has taken place.  Another
   example would involve the use of OAUTH in combination with a
   federations of SBOM servers.

   Another risk is a skew in the SBOM listing and the actual software
   inventory of a device/container.  For example, a manufacturer may
   update the SBOM on its server, but an individual device has not be
   upgraded yet.  This may result in an incorrect policy being applied
   to a device.  A unique mapping of a device's firmware version and its
   SBOM can minimize this risk.

   To further mitigate attacks against a device, manufacturers SHOULD
   recommend access controls through the normal MUD mechanism.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  MUD Extension

   The IANA is requested to add "controller-candidate" to the MUD
   extensions registry as follows:

     Extension Name: sbom
