1.  Introduction

   Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by
   a network to DetNet flows.  DetNet provides these flows with a low
   packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end delivery latency.
   General background and concepts of DetNet can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].

   This document specifies use of the MPLS DetNet encapsulation over an
   IP network.  The approach is modeled on the operation of MPLS over an
   IP Packet Switched Network (PSN) [RFC7510].  It maps the MPLS data
   plane encapsulation described in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] to the DetNet
   IP data plane defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].

   To carry DetNet flows with full functionality at the DetNet layer
   over an IP network, the following components are required (these are
   a subset of the requirements for MPLS encapsulation listed in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls]):

   1.  A method of identifying the DetNet flow group to the processing
       element.

   2.  A method of carrying the DetNet sequence number.

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS over UDP/IP               July 2019


   3.  A method of distinguishing DetNet OAM packets from DetNet data
       packets.

   4.  A method of carrying queuing and forwarding indication.

   These requirements are satisfied by the DetNet over MPLS
   Encapsulation described in [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] and they are partly
   satisfied by the DetNet IP data plane defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip]

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Terms Used in This Document

   This document uses the terminology established in the DetNet
   architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture], and the reader is
   assumed to be familiar with that document and its terminology.

2.2.  Abbreviations

   The following abbreviations are used in this document:

   d-CW          A DetNet Control Word (d-CW) is used for sequencing and
                 identifying duplicate packets of a DetNet flow at the
                 DetNet service sub-layer.

   DetNet        Deterministic Networking.

   A-Label       A special case of an S-Label, whose properties are
                 known only at the aggregation and deaggregation end-
                 points.

   F-Label       A Detnet "forwarding" label that identifies the LSP
                 used to forward a DetNet flow across an MPLS PSN, e.g.,
                 a hop-by-hop label used between label switching
                 routers.

   MPLS          Multiprotocol Label Switching.

   OAM           Operations, Administration, and Maintenance.

   PEF           Packet Elimination Function.

   POF           Packet Ordering Function.

   PRF           Packet Replication Function.

   PSN           Packet Switched Network.

Internet-Draft           DetNet MPLS over UDP/IP               July 2019


   S-Label       A DetNet "service" label that is used between DetNet
                 nodes that implement also the DetNet service sub-layer
                 functions.  An S-Label is also used to identify a
                 DetNet flow at DetNet service sub-layer.

2.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  DetNet MPLS Operation over DetNet IP PSNs

   This document builds on the specification of MPLS over UDP defined in
   [RFC7510].  It may replace partly or entirely the F-Label(s) used in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] with UDP and IP headers.  The UDP and IP
   header information is used to identify DetNet flows, including member
   flows, per [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].  The resulting encapsulation is
   shown in Figure 1.  There may be zero or more F-label(s) between the
   S-label and the UDP header.

   Note that this encapsulation works equally well with IPv4, IPv6, and
   IPv6-based Segment Routing [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].

               Figure 1: UDP/IP Encapsulation of DetNet MPLS

   d-CW, S-Labels and zero or more F-Labels are used as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] and are not modified by this document.  In
   case of aggregates the A-Label is treated as an S-Label and it too is
   not modified.

4.  DetNet Data Plane Procedures

   To support outgoing DetNet MPLS over UDP/IP encapsulation, an
   implementation MUST support the provisioning of UDP and IP header
   information in addition or in place of F-Label(s).  Note, when PRF is
   performed at the MPLS service sub-layer, there will be multiple
   member flows, and each member flow will require the provisioning of
   their own UDP and IP header information.  The headers for each
   outgoing packet MUST be formatted on the configuration information
   and as defined in [RFC7510], with one exception.  Note that the UDP
   Source Port value MUST be set to uniquely identify the DetNet flow.
   The packet MUST then be handed as a DetNet IP packet, per
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].  This includes QoS related traffic treatment.

   To support receive processing an implementation MUST also support the
   provisioning of received UDP and IP header information.  The
   provisioned information MUST be used to identify incoming app-flows
   based on the combination of S-Label and incoming encapsulation header

   information.  Normal receive processing as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls], including PEF and POF, can then take place.

5.  Management and Control Information Summary

   The following summarizes the set of information that is needed to
   configure DetNet MPLS over UDP/IP:

   o  Label information (S-label or F-label) to be mapped to UDP/IP
      flow.  Note that a single S-Label can map to multiple sets of UPD/
      IP information when PREOF is used.

   o  IPv4 and IPv6 source address field.

   o  IPv4 and IPv6 destination address field.

   o  IPv4 Type of Service and IPv6 Traffic Class Fields.

   o  UDP Source Port.

   o  UDP Destination Port.

   This information MUST be provisioned per DetNet flow via
   configuration, e.g., via the controller or management plane.

   It is the responsibility of the DetNet controller plane to properly
   provision both flow identification information and the flow specific
   resources needed to provided the traffic treatment needed to meet
   each flow's service requirements.  This applies for aggregated and
   individual flows.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of DetNet in general are discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and [I-D.ietf-detnet-security].  MPLS
   and IP specific security considerations are described in
   [I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls] and [I-D.ietf-detnet-ip].  This draft does not
   have additional security considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no IANA requests.
