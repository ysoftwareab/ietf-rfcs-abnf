      Expanding the IPv6 Address Prefix Reserved for Documentation
                    draft-horley-v6ops-expand-doc-00

Abstract

   To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating
   documented examples to deployed systems, an IPv6 unicast address
   prefix is reserved for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation,
   and the like.  This document adds an additional prefix to the
   existing reserved IPv6 prefixes, 2001:db8::/32.  This document
   describes the use of the IPv6 address prefix 3ffe::/16 (formerly
   6bone) as a reserved prefix for use in documentation.

1.  Introduction

   The address architecture for IPv6 [RFC4291] does not specifically
   allocate an IPv6 address prefix for use for documentation purposes.
   The current IPv6 documentation prefix of 2001:db8::/32 defined in
   [RFC6890] is not large enough for many design, lab, and documentation
   requirements.  An example of this limitation is apparent when
   doumenting a multi-provder ISP network address plan.  An additional,
   larger allocation would help address these needs.

2.  Expanded Documentation IPv6 Address Prefix

   The additional prefix allocated for documentation purposes is
   3ffe::/16.

3.  Operational Implications

   This assignment implies that IPv6 network operators should add this
   address prefix to the list of non-routeable, bogon IPv6 address
   space, and if packet filters are deployed, this address prefix should

   be added to packet filters intended to prevent public routing of such
   address space.

   Because this address prefix has previously been used for the 6bone,
   and subsequently the 6bone was shutdown, this address prefix is
   already listed in many non-routeable tables, filters and lists.  It
   was also depreferred in [RFC6724] which limits its usability.  In
   addition, the address prefix was returned to IANA and is available to
   be marked for documentation purposes.

   This is not a local-use address prefix, and the filters may be used
   in both local and public contexts.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is to record the allocation of the IPv6 global unicast address
   prefix 3ffe::/16 as a documentation-only prefix in the IPv6 address
   registry.  No end party is to be assigned this address.

5.  Security Considerations

   IPv6 addressing documents generally do not have any direct impact on
   Internet infrastructure security.

   However, the assignment of a new address space for documentation
   purposes does mean, as indicated above, that these addresses SHOULD
   be added to any filters required by individual operators to prevent
   their use for globally routed destinations.

   Lord, and Philip Smith, in authoring the previous proposal for the
   IPv6 documentation prefix.
