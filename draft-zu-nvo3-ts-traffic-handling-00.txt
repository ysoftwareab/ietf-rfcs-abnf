Internet-Draft       Data Plane Handling in NVO3          February 2015


1. Introduction

   A high-level overview of a possible architecture for building NVO3
   overlay networks has been present in [nvo3-arch]. The corresponding
   control plane requirements has documented in [hypervisor-nve-cp] and
   [nve-nva-cp-req].

   Tenant traffic, including the Layer 2 Control Protocol (L2CP)
   specified in IEEE802.1 and Layer 3 Control Protocol (L3CP) specified
   in IETF, needs to be handled carefully in NVO3 network.

   This document is providing some considerations on how the tenant
   traffic shall be handled by NVO3. And several related issues due to
   the required tenant traffic handling procedure are discussed. Section
   4 provides some considerations on how to forward the generic TS
   traffic over NVO3. Section 5 discusses the handling on L2CP messages
   received from the TS. Section 6 is the ARP and ND message
   optimization considerations. Section 7 lists all the issues and
   possible alternatives when dynamic IP routing is supported by a TS.

2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying RFC-2119 significance.

3. Terminology

   This document uses the same terminology as found in the NVO3
   Framework document [framework] and [hypervisor-nve-cp].

4. Tenant Traffic Forwarding

   In NVO3, a L2 NVE implements Ethernet LAN emulation, an Ethernet
   based multipoint service similar to an IETF VPLS [RFC4761] [RFC4762]
   or EVPN [EVPN] service. It forwards the multicast and unicast L2
   traffic between the TSs. From the Tenant Systems aspect, the NVE is
   just like a L2 bridge as specified in IEEE 802.1Q [IEEE 802.1Q].

   A L3 NVE provides Virtualized IP forwarding service, similar to IETF
   IP VPN, e.g. BGP/MPLS IPVPN [RFC4364]. An L3 NVE provides inter-
   subnet layer 3 switching/routing for the TS. The NVE is the first hop
   or next hop router to the attached TS.

Internet-Draft       Data Plane Handling in NVO3          February 2015


   In NVO3, it is very common to provide both L2 and L3 service to a TS.
   In logic view, the TS is attached to a NVE which provides both L2 and
   L3 function. In implementation, the L2 NVE function and L3 NVE
   function may be collocated. The L2 NVE function provides intra-subnet
   traffic forwarding. The L3 NVE function provides inter-subnet traffic
   forwarding.

   In NVO3, to avoid flooding issues, the inner-outer address mapping
   table is built using the NVA-NVE control signaling [nve-nva-cp-req].
   Both L2 and L3 data forwarding are based on the inner-outer address
   mapping table lookup (and forwarding policies).

   The data forwarding procedure is similar for both L2 NVE and L3 NVE.
   Upon receiving a unicast packet from the TS, the NVE performs a
   lookup in the inner-outer address mapping table using the received
   destination IP/MAC address. If a mapping is found, the received
   packet will be encapsulated and forwarded to the destination NVE. If
   no mapping is found, the received unknown unicast packet should be
   dropped. As an alternative, the inner-outer address mapping table
   updating procedure may be triggered using the NVA-NVE control
   signaling [nve-nva-cp-req]. However, an attacker may generate large
   amount of unknown unicast packets from a compromised VM, which may
   result a denial of service (DOS) attacks. Therefore for security
   reason, the inner-outer address mapping table updating procedure
   shall not be triggered too often. One easy way to avoid this kind
   security issue is to implement a frequency limitation function at
   processing TS traffic with unknown destination addresses.

   Discussions: As specified in [nvo3-sec-req], frequency limitation
   shall be supported on the NVA query procedure triggered by any
   received unknown data packets.

5. L2CP

   For a L2 NVE, the VAP is an emulation of a physical Ethernet port. It
   shall have the capability to handle any L2CP.

5.1. STP/RSTP/MSTP

   The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a L2 protocol that ensures a
   loop-free topology for any bridged Ethernet local area network. STP
   is originally standardized as IEEE 802.1D. It is deprecated as of
   802.1d-2004 in favor of Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP). The
   Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) defines an extension to RSTP
   to further develop the usefulness of VLANs.

   In NVO3 network, the L2 forwarding / switching function provided by
   the NVE is based on the destination MAC address and the inner-outer
   address mapping table. There won't be any looping of the L2
   connections among the TSes by the NVEs if the NVE inner-outer address
   mapping table is configured correctly. Therefor there is no need to
   use any L2CP for that purpose among the participated NVEs of a TS.
   However, STP/RSTP/MSTP may be used by the TS, including multi-homing
   case.

   In NVO3 network, the NVE does not need to propagate any STP messages
   to the remote NVEs. But, the NVE may need to learn the Root Bridge
   MAC address and Bridge Priority of the root of the Internal Spanning
   Tree (IST) of the attached layer 2 segment by listening to the BPDUs.

   Discussions: The NVE does not need to forward the STP message. But it
   may need to participate.

5.2. LACP and MC-LAG

   Link Aggregation [IEEE 802.1AXbk-2012] is a mechanism for making
   multiple point-to-point links between a pair of devices appear to be
   a single logical link between those devices.

   MC-LAG [IEEE 802.1aq-2012], or Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation Group,
   is a type of LAG with constituent ports that terminate on separate
   chassis, thereby providing node-level redundancy.

   LACP may be used between the TS and its attached NVE. MC-LAG may be
   used if the TS is attaching to multiple NVEs. In both cases, a L2 NVE
   may have to be involved in the Link Aggregation procedure. When MC-
   LAG is used, Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol (ICCP) needs to be
   enabled.

   Discussions: The NVE may need to support the Link Aggregation
   procedure.

6. ARP and Neighbor Discovery

   For an L2 service, it is not a must for NVE to support any special
   processing of ARP [RFC0826] and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)
   [RFC4861] in NVO3 architecture. The NVE may forward the ARP or ND
   messages using the mcast capability. However, as a performance
   optimization, an NVE does not need to propagate the ARP or ND
   messages. To avoid ARP/ND flooding, it can intercept ARP or ND
   requests received from its attached TSs and respond based on the
   information configured in the inner-outer address mapping table.

Internet-Draft       Data Plane Handling in NVO3          February 2015


   Discussions: To avoid ARP/ND flooding, the NVE may need to response
   to the received messages based on the inner-outer address mapping
   table.

   Upon receiving ARP or ND request from a TS, the NVE sends the ARP or
   ND response with the requested MAC address back. The NVE may perform
   ARP or ND proxy when responding the ARP or ND request. If the NVE
   does not have the interested MAC information in the receiving ARP or
   ND request, it may query the NVA using the NVA-NVE control signaling
   [nve-nva-cp-req]. However, an attacker may generate large amount of
   ARP / ND request packets from a compromised VM, which may result a
   denial of service (DOS) attacks. Therefore for security reason, the
   inner-outer address mapping table updating procedure shall not be
   triggered too often. One easy way to avoid this kind security issue
   is to implement frequency limitation function at processing TS ARP/ND
   request messages.

   Discussions: As specified in [nvo3-sec-req], the NVE shall have a
   frequency limitation at sending NVA query message triggered by the
   received ARP/ND request messages with unknown MAC addresses.

   In Multi-Homing NVE scenarios, a TS may be reachable via more than
   one NVEs. In this case, if ARP / ND proxy is supported at the
   participated NVEs of the same network segment where a TS is attached,
   all participated NVEs may be aware of the same location of the
   traffic's destination. Therefore, all participated NVEs may offer its
   own MAC address for the same destination IP address in the ARP / ND
   reply message, which could be a racing condition. One NVE may need to
   be selected by the NVA at each network segment to avoid racing issue.
   Only the selected NVE can response to the ARP / ND request at the
   attached network segment.

   Discussions: The NVA may need a property way to select one NVE per
   network segment of a TS for ARP / ND proxy of given destination IP
   addresses to avoid the racing issue.

   At VM mobility, a VM may be moved from one layer-2 segment to another
   layer-2 segment, assuming IP address preservation is supported. To
   optimize the ARP or ND updating procedure, both the source NVE and
   the target NVE can have the same MAC address configured at the VAP
   where the TS attached.

   Discussions: The NVA may need a property way to configure the
   participated NVEs with same MAC address on the VAP of the same VN at
   each network segment. However, at Multi-Homing NVE scenarios, the NVA
   may need a property way to configure the participated NVEs on the VAP

   of the same VN at each network segment to avoid duplicated MAC
   address issue.

7. Routing protocol

   IP routing protocol may be used by the TS for dynamic IP forwarding.
   A routing protocol specifies how routers communicate with each other,
   disseminating information that enables them to select routes between
   any two nodes on a computer network.

   In NVO3, there are different developments to support layer 3
   services: centralized GW function, distributed GW function, or the
   combination of both.

   If the layer 3 service is provided by a NVO3 Centralized Gateway
   function, the TS routing function and the NVO3 Centralized Gateway
   functions appears as router adjacencies to each other. A routing
   protocol may be used between the routers for overlay data plane. Any
   TS routing messages (e.g. routing updates message from a vR function
   installed in a VM of the TS) will be handled by the NVO3 Centralized
   Gateway function. Once there is a routing rules installation or
   updating, the NVO3 Centralized Gateway function may update its
   routing distribution polices and forward data packets accordingly.
   The user data packet will be forwarded by the attached NVE to the
   NVO3 Centralized Gateway function. Then the NVO3 Centralized Gateway
   function will make the layer 3 routing decision that either
   discarding the packet or tunneling it to the destination NVE where
   the destination VM attached. In this case, the NVE functions, both
   source and destination, only need to support layer 2 functions.

   If the layer 3 service is provided by the Distributed GW function
   embedded in the L3 NVE, this can be an issue for dynamic routing
   updates. In tenant view, the Distributed GW function appears as next
   hop router to the TS routing functions, e.g. vR functions installed
   in a VM of the TS. The Distributed GW function embedded in the L3 NVE
   may need to support one or more routing protocols (e.g. BGP/OSPF/RIP)
   to learn any TS routing rules installation or updating. This allows a
   L3 NVE and the attached TS router to learn the IP routes updates from
   each other. However, as the TS packet forwarding in the L3 NVE is
   based on the inner-outer address mapping table configured by NVA
   using the NVA-NVE control protocol, any TS routing updates may
   trigger the inner-outer address mapping table updates accordingly,
   not only in the attached L3 NVE, but also in the remote participated
   L3 NVEs. With the NVO3 architecture specified in [nvo3-arch], it is
   an issue on how this dynamic updates can be done.

   Figure 1 is an example of the interactions between the distributed GW
   function and the vR in TS. The TS1 is attached with NVE1 and NVE2.
   And TS2 is attached with NVE3. Both TS1 and TS2 may have v-Routing
   function enabled in the VM. The distributed GW function is supported
   in NVE1, NVE2 and NVE3. In this example, the vR in TS1 and the dGW in
   NVE1/NVE2 are routing peers. The vR in TS2 and the dGW in NVE3 are
   routing peer. Two forwarding paths are available between TS1 and TS2.
   The TS packets between TS1 and TS2 are forwarded using NVE1-NVE3
   tunnel or NVE2-NVE3 tunnel based on the inner-outer address mapping
   table which is configured by the NVA.

                  Figure 1 example of TS dynamic routing

   The issue is that the TS may want to change the routing policies at
   any time. For instance, initially the NVE3 may be configured with a
   routing policy that any traffic from TS2 to TS1 shall use the NVE3-
   NVE1 tunnel. At some point, TS1 may want to change that police. It
   would like to use the route with NVE2 for the traffic with TS2. Or it
   may have a new route available, e.g. a new subnet installed in TS1,
   and it would like to use the route with NVE2 for the new installed
   subnet. At any of above routing updates, both NVE 1 and NVE 2 may be
   informed by TS1 using a routing protocol, e.g. OSPF. At receiving the
   routing update messages, both NVE1 and NVE2 shall process it and may
   update its inner-outer address mapping table accordingly. However

Internet-Draft       Data Plane Handling in NVO3          February 2015


   this inner-outer address mapping table update is only good for the
   traffic forwarding from TS1 to TS2. The problem is how to update the
   NVE3 for the traffic forwarding from TS2 to TS1, which the NVE3 shall
   update its inner-outer address mapping table accordingly as well.

   Discussion: Alternatives are:

   -  Alt A: Limiting the usage of distributed GW function in NVO3.
     Using the centralized GW function for the TS with dynamic IP
     routing is enabled. The Distributed GW function is only used for a
     TS where TS dynamic IP routing is not enabled. With this
     limitation, there is no NVO3 control plane impact.

   -  Alt B: Using NVE-NVE interaction messages to flood the peer L3
     NVEs. For instance, the L3NVE may inform the peer NVEs with the
     received routing updates information. However, in this case,
     should the peer NVE update its inner-outer address mapping table
     without NVA's involvements? This may be challenging the NVA's
     centralized control role. And it may also cause some security
     violation concerns.

   -  Alt C: Using the NVA-NVE signaling to update the peer L3 NVEs. In
     this case, the L3 NVE shall not forward any routing updates
     information to any peer NVEs to avoid flooding. Instead, it shall
     always inform the NVA about any routing changes. Then the NVA will
     use the NVA-NVE signaling for the inner-outer address mapping
     table updating at the peer NVE.

   -  Alt D: Collocated NVA and GW function. With this alternative, the
     TS routing policies (i.e. RIB) is managed by the collocated GW
     function. It is assumed that the NVA is synced with the collocated
     GW function. The Distributed GW function embedded in the NVE is
     installed with the TS IP forwarding policies (i.e. FIB or inner-
     outer address mapping table). The TS routing messages will be
     terminated at the collocated GW function which is the next hop
     router of the TS routing function. If there is any TS routing
     installing and updating, the collocated GW function may update the
     routing policies (i.e. RIB), and the NVA will notify the
     distributed GW functions with the updated inner-outer address
     mapping table using the NVA-NVE control signaling.

8. Security Considerations
