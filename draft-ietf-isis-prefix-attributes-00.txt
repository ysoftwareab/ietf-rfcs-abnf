1.  Introduction

   There are existing use cases in which knowing additional attributes
   of a prefix is useful.  For example, it is useful to know whether an
   advertised prefix is directly connected to the advertising router or
   not.  In the case of [SR] knowing whether a prefix is directly
   connected or not determines what action should be taken as regards

   processing of labels associated with an incoming packet.  Current
   formats of the Extended Reachability TLVs for both IP and IPv6 are
   fixed and do not allow the introduction of additional flags without
   backwards compatibility issues.  Therefore a new sub-TLV is
   introduced which allows for the advertisement of attribute flags
   associated with prefix advertisements.

   It is also useful to know the source of a prefix advertisement when
   the advertisement has been leaked to another level.  Therefore a new
   sub-TLV is introduced to advertise the router-id of the originator of
   a prefix advertisement.

2.  New sub-TLVs for Extended Reachability TLVs

   The following new sub-TLVs are introduced:

   o  IPv4/IPv6 Extended Reachability Attributes

   o  IPv4 Source Router ID

   o  IPv6 Source Router ID

   All sub-TLVs are applicable to TLVs 135, 235, 236, and/or 237.

2.1.  IPv4/IPv6 Extended Reachability Attribute Flags

   This sub-TLV supports the advertisement of additional flags
   associated with a given prefix advertisement.  The behavior of each
   flag when a prefix advertisement is leaked from one level to another
   (upwards or downwards) is explicitly defined below.

   All flags are applicable to TLVs 135, 235, 236, 237 unless otherwise
   stated.

   Prefix Attribute Flags
   Type:   4 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)
   Length: Number of octets to follow
   Value

        (Length * 8) bits.

     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7...
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...
    |X|R|N|          ...
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...

   Bits are defined/sent starting with Bit #0 defined below. Additional
   bit definitions which may be defined in the future SHOULD be assigned
   in ascending bit order so as to minimize the number of bits which
   will need to be transmitted.

   Undefined bits SHOULD be transmitted as 0 and MUST be
   ignored on receipt.

   Bits which are NOT transmitted MUST be treated as if they are
   set to 0 on receipt.

   X-Flag: External Prefix Flag (Bit 0)
       Set if the prefix has been redistributed from another protocol.
       This includes the case where multiple virtual routers are
       supported and the source of the redistributed prefix is another
       IS-IS instance.
       The flag is preserved when leaked between levels.
       In TLVs 236 and 237 this flag SHOULD always be sent as 0 and
       MUST be ignored on receipt. This is because there is an existing
       X flag defined in the fixed format of these TLVs as specified in
       [RFC5308] and [RFC5120].

   R-Flag: Re-advertisement Flag (Bit 1)
       Set when the prefix has been leaked from one level to another
       (upwards or downwards).

   N-flag: Node Flag (Bit 2)
       Set when the prefix identifies the advertising router i.e., the
       prefix is a host prefix advertising a globally reachable address
       typically associated with a loopback address.
       The advertising router MAY choose to NOT set this flag even when
       the above conditions are met.
       If the flag is set and the prefix length is NOT a host prefix
       (/32 for IPV4, /128 for IPv6) then the flag MUST be ignored.
       The flag is preserved when leaked between levels.

2.2.  IPv4/IPv6 Source Router ID

   When a reachability advertisement is leaked from one level to
   another, the source of the original advertisement is unknown.  In
   cases where the advertisement is an identifier for the advertising
   router (e.g., N-flag set in the Extended Reachability Attribute sub-
   TLV as described in the previous section) it may be useful for other
   routers to know the source of the advertisement.  The sub-TLVs
   defined below provide this information.

     IPv4 Source Router ID
     Type:   11 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)
     Length: 4
     Value: IPv4 Router ID of the source of the advertisement

     Inclusion of this TLV is optional and MAY occur in TLVs
     135, 235, 236, or 237.

     If present the sub-TLV MUST be included when the prefix
     advertisement is leaked to another level.

     IPv6 Source Router ID
     Type:   12 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)
     Length: 16
     Value: IPv6 Router ID of the source of the advertisement

     Inclusion of this TLV is optional and MAY occur in TLVs
     135, 235, 236, or 237.

     If present the sub-TLV MUST be included when the prefix
     advertisement is leaked to another level.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds the following new sub-TLVs to the registry of sub-
   TLVs for TLVs 135, 235, 236, 237.

   Value: 4 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)

   Name: Prefix Attribute Flags

   Value: 11 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)

   Name: IPv4 Source Router ID

   Value: 12 (suggested - to be assigned by IANA)

   Name: IPv6 Source Router ID

   This document also introduces a new registry for bit values in the
   Prefix Attribute Flags sub-TLV.  Registration policy is Expert Review
   as defined in [RFC5226].  Defined values are:

        Bit #   Name
        -----   ------------------------
        0       External Prefix Flag
        1       Re-advertisement Flag
        2       Node Flag

   None.
