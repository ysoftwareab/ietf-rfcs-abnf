   IP Multicast group addresses in the 232/8 (232.0.0.0 to
   232.255.255.255) range are designated as source-specific multicast
   destination addresses and are reserved for use by source-specific
   multicast applications and protocols. This document defines
   operational recommendations to ensure source-specific behavior within
   the 232/8 range.

1.  Introduction


   Current PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) [RFC2362] relies on the shared
   Rendezvous Point (RP) tree to learn about active sources for a group
   and to support group-generic (not source specific) data distribution.
   The IP Multicast group address range 232/8 has been designated for
   Source-Specific PIM [RFC3569] applications and protocols [IANA] and
   SHOULD support source-only trees only, precluding the requirement of
   an RP and a shared tree; active sources in the 232/8 range will be
   discovered out of band. PIM Sparse Mode Designated Routers (DR), with
   local membership, are capable of joining the shortest path tree for
   the source directly using Source-Specific PIM (also known as PIM-SSM
   or simply SSM).

   Operational best common practices in the 232/8 group address range
   are necessary to ensure shortest path source-only trees across
   multiple domains in the Internet [RFC3569], and to prevent data from
   sources sending to groups in the 232/8 range from arriving via shared
   trees. This avoids unwanted data arrival, and allows several sources
   to use the same group address without conflict at the receivers.

   The operational practices SHOULD:

    o Prevent local sources from sending to shared tree

    o Prevent receivers from joining the shared tree

    o Prevent RP's as candidates for 232/8

    o Prevent remote sources from being learned/joined via MSDP
     [RFC3618]



2.  Operational practices in 232/8




2.1.  Preventing local sources from sending to shared tree


   Eliminating the use of shared trees for groups in 232/8, while
   maintaining coexistence with PIM-SM, behavior of the RP and/or the DR
   needs to be modified. This can be accomplished by

    - preventing data for 232/8 groups from being sent encapsulated to
      the RP by the DR

    - preventing the RP from accepting registers for 232/8 groups from
      the DR

    - preventing the RP from forwarding accepted data down (*,G)
      tree for 232/8 groups



2.2.  Preventing remote sources from being learned/joined via MSDP


   PIM-SSM does not require active source announcements via MSDP. All
   source announcements are received out of band, the the last hop
   router being responsible for sending (S,G) joins directly to the
   source. To prevent propagation of SAs in the 232/8 range, an RP
   SHOULD

    - never originate an SA for any 232/8 groups

    - never accept or forward an SA for any 232/8 groups.

2.3.  Preventing receivers from joining the shared tree


   Local PIM domain practices need to be enforced to prevent local
   receivers from joining the shared tree for 232/8 groups. This can be
   accomplished by

    - preventing DR from sending (*,G) joins for 232/8 groups

    - preventing RP from accepting (*,G) join for 232/8 groups


   However, within a local PIM domain, any last-hop router NOT
   preventing (*,G) joins may trigger unwanted (*,G) state toward the RP
   which intersects an existing (S,G) tree, allowing the receiver on the
   shared tree to receive the data, breaking the source-specific
   [RFC3569] service model. It is therefore recommended that ALL routers
   in the domain MUST reject AND never originate (*,G) joins for 232/8
   groups.

   In those cases in which an ISP is offering its customers (or others)
   the use of the ISP's RP, the ISP SHOULD NOT allow (*,G) joins in the
   232/8 range.



2.4.  Preventing RP's as candidates for 232/8


   Because PIM-SSM does not require an RP, all RPs SHOULD NOT offer
   themselves as candidates in the 232/8 range. This can be accomplished
   by

    - preventing RP/BSR from announcing in the 232/8 range

    - preventing ALL routers from accepting RP delegations in the
      232/8 range

    - precluding RP functionality on RP for the 232/8 range

   Note that in typical practice, RP's announce themselves as candidates
   for the 224/4 (which obviously includes 232/8). It is still
   acceptable to allow the advertisement of 224/4 (or any other superset
   of 232/8); however, this approach relies on the second point, above,
   namely, that routers silently just ignore the RP delegation in the
   232/8 range, and prevent sending or receiving using the shared tree,
   as described previously.  Finally, an RP SHOULD NOT be configured as
   a candidate RP for 232/8 (or more specific range).

3.  Intellectual Property


   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and
   standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11 [RFC2028].
   Copies of claims of rights made available for publication and any
   assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an
   attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use of
   such proprietary rights by implementors or users of this
   specification can be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary
   rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice

5.  Security Considerations


   This document describes operational practices that introduce no new
   security issues to either PIM-SM or PIM-SSM.

   However, in the event that the operational practices described in
   this document are not adhered to, some problems may surface.  In
   particular, section 2.3 describes the effects of non-compliance of
   last-hop routers (or to some degree, rogue hosts sending PIM messages
   themselves) on the source-specific service model; creating the (*,G)
   state for source-specific (S,G) could enable a receiver to receive
   data it should not get. This can be mitigated by host-side multicast
