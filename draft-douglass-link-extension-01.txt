Internet-Draft         Link Extension to Icalendar              May 2011


1.  Introduction

   The currently existing iCalendar standard [RFC5545] lacks a general
   purpose method for referencing additional, external information
   relating to calendar components.

   This document proposes a method for referencing typed external
   information that can provide additional information about an
   iCalendar component.  This new LINK property is closely aligned to
   the LINK header defined in [RFC5988]

   In addition the RELTYPE parameter is extended to take new values
   defining temporal relationships, a GAP parameter is defined to
   provide lead and lag values and RELATED-TO is extended to allow URI
   values.  These changes allows the RELATED-TO property to define a
   richer set of relationships useful for project management.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].


2.  Typed References

   The LINK property defines a typed reference or relation to external
   meta-data or related resources.  By providing type and format
   information as parameters, clients and servers are able to discover
   interesting references and make use of them, perhaps for indexing or
   the presentation of interesting links for the user.

   It is often necessary to relate calendar components.  The current
   RELATED-TO property only allows for a UID which is inadequate for
   many purposes.  Allowing other types may help but might raise a
   number of backward compatibility issues.  The link property can link
   components in different collections or even on different servers.

   When publishing events it is useful to be able to refer back to the
   source of that information.  The actual event may have been consumed
   from a feed or an ics file on a web site.  A LINK property can
   provide a reference to the originator of the event.

   Project management tools often need to be able to specify the
   relationships between the various events and tasks which make up a
   project.  This specification defines relation types for those
   purposes.

3.  Reference Types

   The actual reference value can take three forms specified by the type
   parameter

   URI:  The default type.  This is a URI referring to the target.

   UID:  This allows for linking within a single collection and the
      value is assumed to be another component within that collection.

   REFERENCE:  An xpointer.  In an XML environment it may be necessary
      to refer to an external XML artifact.  The XPointer is defined in
      [W3C.WD-xptr-xpointer-20021219] and allows addressing portions of
      XML documents.


4.  Link Relation Types

   [RFC5988] defines two form of relation types, registered and
   extension.  Registered relation types are added to a registry defined
   by [RFC5988] while extension relation types are specified as unique
   unregistered URIs, (at least unregistered in the [RFC5988] registry).

   The relation types defined here will be registered with IANA in
   accordance with the specifications in [RFC5988].


5.  Redefined Relation Type Value

   Relationship parameter type values are defined in section 3.2.15. of
   [RFC5545].  This specification redefines that type to include the new
   values FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH and STARTTOSTART.

      This property parameter is defined by the following notation:

        reltypeparam       = "RELTYPE" "="
                            ("PARENT"    ; Parent relationship - Default
                           / "CHILD"     ; Child relationship
                           / "SIBLING"   ; Sibling relationship
                           / "FINISHTOSTART"
                           / "FINISHTOFINISH"
                           / "STARTTOFINISH"
                           / "STARTTOSTART"
                           / iana-token  ; Some other IANA-registered
                                         ; iCalendar relationship type
                           / x-name)     ; A non-standard, experimental
                                         ; relationship type

   Description:  This parameter can be specified on a property that
      references another related calendar.  The parameter may specify
      the hierarchical relationship type of the calendar component
      referenced by the property when the value is PARENT, CHILD or
      SIBLING.  It defines the temporal relationship when the value is
      one of FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH or
      STARTTOSTART.  If this parameter is not specified on an allowable
      property, the default relationship type is PARENT.  Applications
      MUST treat x-name and iana-token values they don't recognize the
      same way as they would the PARENT value.

   RELTYPE=PARENT:  Identifies the referenced calendar component is a
      superior of calendar component

   RELTYPE=CHILD:  Indicates that the referenced calendar component is a
      subordinate of the calendar component.

   RELTYPE=SIBLING:  Indicates that the referenced calendar component is
      a peer of the calendar component.

   RELTYPE=FINISHTOSTART:  As soon as the Predecessor Interval finishes,
      the Successor Interval starts.  For example, when sanding is
      complete, painting begins.

   RELTYPE=FINISHTOFINISH:  The Successor Interval continues as long as
      the Predecessor Interval.  For example, the concession stand stops
      serving 20 minutes after the end of the game.

   RELTYPE=STARTTOFINISH:  The start of the Predecessor controls the
      finish of the Successor.  For example, the start of Attendee
      Check-in controls the end of the interval "Set up registration
      booth."

   RELTYPE=STARTTOSTART:  The Predecessor Interval triggers the start of
      the second task.  The Gap indicates the lag time.  For example, 20
      minutes after the caterer begins work, the dining lines are open.


6.  New Property Parameters

6.1.  Rel

   Parameter name:  REL

   Purpose:  To specify the relationship of data referenced by a LINK
      property.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     relparam      = "REL" "="
                     ("SOURCE"      ; Link to source of this component
                    / DQUOTE uri DQUOTE
                    / x-name        ; Experimental reference type
                    / iana-token)   ; Other IANA registered type

   Description:  This parameter MUST be specified on all LINK
      properties, and defines the type of reference.  This allows
      programs consuming this data to automatically scan for references
      they support.  In addition to the values defined here any value
      defined in [RFC5988] may be used.  There is no default relation
      type.

   REL=SOURCE:  identifies the source of the event information.

   Registration:  These relation types are registered in [RFC5988]

6.2.  Gap

   Parameter name:  GAP

   Purpose:  To specify the length of the gap, positive or negative
      between two temporally related components.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     gapparam      = "GAP" "=" dur-value

Internet-Draft         Link Extension to Icalendar              May 2011


   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on the RELATED-TO
      property, and defines the duration of time between the predecessor
      and successor in an interval.

6.3.  Title

   Parameter name:  TITLE

   Purpose:  To provide a human readable title.

   Format Definition:

      This parameter is defined by the following notation:

     titleparam     = "TITLE" "=" text

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on all LINK properties,
      and provides a human readable label, perhaps for icons or links..


7.  New Parameter Values

   This specification defines a new value to be used with the VALUE
   property parameter:

   UID  VALUE=UID indicates that the associated value is the UID for a
      component.

   REFERENCE  VALUE=REFERENCE indicates that the associated value is an
      xpointer referencing an associated XML artifact.


8.  New Properties

8.1.  Link

   Property name:  LINK

   Purpose:  This property provides a reference to external information
      about a component.

   Value type:  URI, TEXT or REFERENCE

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, reference type or format type
      parameters can be specified on this property.

Internet-Draft         Link Extension to Icalendar              May 2011


   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified in any iCalendar
      component.

   Description:  When used in a component the value of this property
      points to additional information related to the component.  For
      example, it may reference the originating web server.

   Format Definition:

      This property is defined by the following notation:

     link            = "LINK" linkparam ":" ( ":" uri ) /
                       (
                         ";" "VALUE" "=" "REFERENCE"
                         ":" text
                       )
                       CRLF


     linkparam       = *(

                     ; the following is MANDATORY
                     ; and MAY occur more than once

                     (";" relparam) /

                     ; the following are MANDATORY
                     ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                     (";" gapparam) /
                     (";" fmttypeparam) /
                     (";" titleparam) /

                     ; the following is OPTIONAL
                     ; and MAY occur more than once

                     (";" xparam)

                     )


   Example:

      The following is an example of this property.  It points to a
      server acting as the source for the event.

                    LINK;REL=SOURCE;TITLE=The Egg:
                      http://example.com/events

9.  Redefined RELATED-TO Property

9.1.  RELATED-TO

   Property name:  RELATED-TO

   Purpose:  This property is used to represent a relationship or
      reference between one calendar component and another.  The
      definition here extends the definition in Section 3.8.4.5. of
      [RFC5545] by allowing URI values adn a GAP parameter.

   Value type:  URI or TEXT

   Property Parameters:  Non-standard, reference type, gap, value or
      format type parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property MAY be specified in any iCalendar
      component.

   Description:  By default or when VALUE=UID is specified, the property
      value consists of the persistent, globally unique identifier of
      another calendar component.  This value would be represented in a
      calendar component by the "UID" property.

      By default, the property value points to another calendar
      component that has a PARENT relationship to the referencing
      object.  The "RELTYPE" property parameter is used to either
      explicitly state the default PARENT relationship type to the
      referenced calendar component or to override the default PARENT
      relationship type and specify either a CHILD or SIBLING
      relationship or a temporal relationship.

      The PARENT relationship indicates that the calendar component is a
      subordinate of the referenced calendar component.  The CHILD
      relationship indicates that the calendar component is a superior
      of the referenced calendar component.  The SIBLING relationship
      indicates that the calendar component is a peer of the referenced
      calendar component.

      The FINISHTOSTART, FINISHTOFINISH, STARTTOFINISH or STARTTOSTART
      relationships define temporal relationships as specified in the
      reltype parameter definition.

      Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property can
      have an implicit impact on the related calendar component.  For
      example, if a group event changes its start or end date or time,
      then the related, dependent events will need to have their start
      and end dates changed in a corresponding way.  Similarly, if a

Internet-Draft         Link Extension to Icalendar              May 2011


      PARENT calendar component is cancelled or deleted, then there is
      an implied impact to the related CHILD calendar components.  This
      property is intended only to provide information on the
      relationship of calendar components.  It is up to the target
      calendar system to maintain any property implications of this
      relationship.

   Format Definition:

      This property is defined by the following notation:

      related    = "RELATED-TO" relparam ( ":" text ) /
                   (
                     ";" "VALUE" "=" "UID"
                     ":" uid
                   )
                   (
                     ";" "VALUE" "=" "URI"
                     ":" uri
                   )
                   CRLF

      relparam   = *(
                 ;
                 ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                 ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                 ;
                 (";" reltypeparam) /
                 (";" gapparam) /
                 ;
                 ; The following is OPTIONAL,
                 ; and MAY occur more than once.
                 ;
                 (";" other-param)
                 ;
                 )

   Example:

      The following are examples of this property.

          RELATED-TO:jsmith.part7.19960817T083000.xyzMail@example.com
