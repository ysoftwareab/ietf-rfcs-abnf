Internet Draft                  syslogMIB                   January 2007


1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2. Background

   Operating systems, processes and applications, collectively termed
   "facilities" in the following, generate messages indicating their own
   status or the occurrence of events. These messages are handled by
   what has come to be known as the syslog application[RFCPROT].  In
   this document we refer to a syslog application as a syslog entity. A
   syslog entity sends and/or receives syslog messages. The reader is
   referred to [RFCPROT] for a description of the various roles of a
   syslog entity viz. "sender", "receiver" and "relay". The discussion
   in this document in general applies to a generic syslog entity. For
   special cases the specific role of the syslog application will be
   mentioned.  [RFCUDPX] describes the UDP transport for the syslog
   protocol.

   This document defines a set of managed objects (MOs) that can be used
   to monitor a group of syslog entities.

   The SYSLOG-MIB can be used in conjunction with other MIB modules - in
   particular the Host Resources MIB[RFC2790]. The generic process
   related matters e.g. control and monitoring for status, resource
   usage etc. can be serviced by the corresponding entries in the Host
   Resources MIB.

                 Ent3: Syslog originator (syslog sender)

                   Fig.1 Syslog entities modeled by the SYSLOG-MIB

   The syslog entities modeled by the SYSLOG-MIB are shown in Fig.1.  A
   syslog receiver receives syslog messages. A syslog sender sends
   syslog messages to other syslog entities. A syslog relay will forward
   some of the received syslog messages to other syslog entities. A
   syslog receiver receives a syslog message and processes it. The
   processing will depend on the internal configuration and may involve
   relaying the message to another syslog entity. Note that a syslog
   entity may have multiple roles.  Multiple syslog entities may co-
   exist on the same host.


3. The MIB Design.

   The purpose of the SYSLOG-MIB is to allow the monitoring of a group
   of syslog entities. This requires managed objects representing the
   following elements.

   o  The default configuration parameters e.g. the default maximum
      message size for a syslog entity, the default port number on
      which a syslog receiver will listen for messages, etc.
   o  The configuration and status related details of each syslog
      entity.
   o  The statistics on syslog messages received, processed
      locally, relayed by each syslog entity.

Internet Draft                  syslogMIB                   January 2007


   The MIB contains four subtrees.
   o  The syslogSystem subtree services the default configuration
      parameters.
   o  The syslogEntity subtree consists of the following tables.
      - SyslogEntityControlTable deals with the configuration and
        control information for a syslog entity.
      - SyslogEntityOperationsTable deals with operations and
        statistical information about syslog messages sent and/or
        received by a syslog entity.
   o  The syslogNotifications subtree defines the set of
      notifications that will be used to asynchronously report
      the status of a syslog entity.
   o  The conformance subtree defines the compliance statements.

   The SYSLOG-MIB module uses textual conventions defined in INET-
   ADDRESS-MIB[RFC4001] and SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB[RFC3411].

       DESCRIPTION
           "The MIB module for monitoring syslog entities.

            In this MIB we refer to a syslog application
            or device as a syslog entity. A syslog entity sends
            and/or receives syslog messages. The reader is referred

5. Security Considerations


   Syslog plays a very important role in the computer and network
   security of an organization. SYSLOG-MIB defines several managed
   objects that may be used to monitor, configure and control syslog
   entities. As such improper manipulation of the objects represented by
   this MIB may lead to an attack on an important component of the
   computer and network security infrastructure. The objects in
   syslogEntityControlTable may be misconfigured to cause syslog
   messages to be diverted or lost.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

            o  syslogEntityControlTable: The objects in this table
               describe the configuration of the syslog entities.
               It may be misconfigured to start up a very large
               number of syslog entities (processes) and deny the
               system of its resources.
            o  syslogEntityControlBindAddr: This object may be
               misconfigured to bind syslog entity to the wrong
               address. This will cause messages to be lost.
            o  syslogEntityControlService : This object may be
               misconfigured to bind syslog entity to the wrong
               service (port). This will cause messages to be lost.
            o  syslogEntityControlMaxMessageSize: This message may be
               misconfigured to set the wrong MaxMessageSize for the
               syslog entity. It may cause syslog messages to be lost.
            o  syslogEntityControlConfFileName: This object may be
               misconfigured to start the syslog entity with the
               wrong (rogue) configuration.
            o  syslogEntityControlStorageType: This object may be
               misconfigured to set the wrong storage type. That may
               cause confusion, operational errors and/or loss of
               information.


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or

Internet Draft                  syslogMIB                   January 2007


   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

           o  syslogEntityOperationsTable: Objects in this table carry
              sensitive information. The counters may reveal
              information about the deployment and effectiveness of
              the relevant security systems. The counters may be
              analyzed to tell whether the security systems are able
              to detect an event or not.

           o  syslogEntityOperationsLastError: This object may contain
              sensitive information e.g. user-id, password etc.
              depending on the implementation of the syslog entity.
              It may reveal details about the syslog implementation
              itself, e.g. version, OS etc.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB modules in this document use the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

   Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
   ----------        -----------------------

   syslogMIB         { mib-2 YYYY }

   IANA Reg.: Please assign a value under the 'mib-2' subtree
              for the 'syslogMIB' MODULE-IDENTITY  and record
              the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.

   RFC Ed.: When the above assignments have been made, please
              - remove the above note
              - replace "YYYY" here with the assigned values and
              - remove this note.

          and syslog-transport-udp-07.txt: the REFERNCE
          clauses have changed.
        o The TEXTUAL-CONVENTION SyslogTransport has been
          replaced by the TransportAddressType.
        o The TEXTUAL-CONVENTION SyslogFacility and
          SyslogSeverity have been aligned with
          syslog-protocol-17.txt
        o A paragraph has been added to list the related
          MIBs from which MOS and TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs have
          been imported.
        o The target of this MIB is now called a syslog
          entity. [ Earlier it was referred to as a syslog
          device.] The prefix syslDev has been changed to
          syslEnt
        o The DEFVALS have been aligned with the reference
          documents.
        o The REFERENCE section has been updated.
        o The OID for syslogConformance has been changed
          from 4 to 3.

    DESCRIPTION
        "A near complete overhaul of the MIB and the document.

         preparation.
         TBD. The reference clauses need to be redone once the
              new syslog document is ready.

         List of authors changed. Original draft author Bruno
         Pape is acknowledged in the Acknowledgments section.
