1.  Introduction

   This document specifies encrypted DNS configuration for an IKE
   initiator, particularly the Authentication Domain Name (ADN, defined
   in [RFC8310]) of DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484] or DNS-over-TLS (DoT)
   [RFC7858] server using Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2
   (IKEv2) [RFC7296].

   Particularly, this document introduces a new IKEv2 Configuration
   Payload Attribute Types (Section 4) for the support of encrypted DNS
   servers (e.g., DoT, DoH).

   Sample use cases are discussed in Section 3.  The Configuration
   Payload Attribute Type defined in Section 4 is not specific to these
   deployments, but can be used in other deployment contexts.

   Note that, for many years, typical designs has often considered that
   the DNS server was usually located inside the protected domain, but
   could theoretically be located outside of it.  With DoH or DoT, the
   latter option becomes plausible.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC8499] and
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-ter].

   Also, this document makes use of the terms defined in [RFC7296].  In
   particular, readers should be familiar with "initiator" and
   "responder" terms used in that document.

   Do53 refers to unencrypted DNS.

   'DoH/DoT' refers to DNS-over-HTTPS and/or DNS-over-TLS.

3.  Sample Deployment Scenarios

3.1.  Roaming Enterprise Users

   In this Enterprise scenario (Section 1.1.3 of [RFC7296]), a roaming
   user connects to the Enterprise network through an IPsec tunnel.  The
   split-tunnel Virtual Private Network (VPN) configuration allows the
   endpoint to access hosts that resides in the Enterprise network
   [RFC8598] using that tunnel; other traffic not destined to the
   Enterprise does not traverse the tunnel.  In contrast, a non-split-
   tunnel VPN configuration causes all traffic to traverse the tunnel
   into the enterprise.

   For both split- and non-split-tunnel configurations, the use of DoT/
   DoH instead of Do53 provides privacy and integrity protection along
   the entire path (rather than just to the VPN termination device) and
   can communicate the DoT/DoH server policies.

   For split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
   Enterprise-provided DoT/DoH server to resolve internal-only domain
   names.

   For non-split-tunnel VPN configurations, the endpoint uses the
   Enterprise-provided DoT/DoH server to resolve both internal and
   external domain names.

   Enterprise networks are susceptible to internal and external attacks.
   To minimize that risk all enterprise traffic is encrypted
   (Section 2.1 of [I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t]).

3.2.  VPN Service Provider

   Legacy VPN service providers usually preserve end-users' data
   confidentiality by sending all communication traffic through an
   encrypted tunnel.  A VPN service provider can also provide guarantees
   about the security of the VPN network by filtering malware and
   phishing domains.

   Browsers and OSes support DoH/DoT; VPN providers may no longer expect
   DNS clients to fallback to Do53 just because it is a closed network.

   The DoT/DoH server hosted by the VPN service provider can be securely
   discovered by the endpoint using the IKEv2 Configuration Payload
   Attribute Type.

3.3.  DNS Offload

   VPN service providers typically allow split-tunnel VPN configuration
   in which users can choose applications that can be excluded from the
   tunnel.  For example, users may exclude applications that restrict
   VPN access.

   VPN service providers can also offer publicly accessible DoH/DoT
   servers.  The split-tunnel VPN configuration allows the client to
   access the DoH/DoT servers hosted by the VPN provider without
   traversing the tunnel.

   The DoT/DoH server hosted by the VPN service provider can be securely
   discovered by the endpoint using the IKEv2 Configuration Payload
   Attribute Type.

4.  INTERNAL_ENC_DNS Attribute

   The INTERNAL_ENC_DNS IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Type is
   used to configure an encrypted DNS server.  The format of this
   attribute is shown in Figure 1.

       +---------------------------------------------------------------+

                Figure 1: INTERNAL_ENC_DNS Attribute Format

   The fields of the attribute shown in Figure 1 are as follows:

   o  R: Reserved bit; refer to Section 3.15.1 of [RFC7296].

   o  Attribute Type: MUST be set to TBA (Section 8.1).

   o  Length: Length of the data in octets.  It MUST be set to 1 if the
      Configuration payload has types CFG_REQUEST or CFG_ACK or to (2 +
      Length of the ADN + N * 16) if the Configuration payload has types
      CFG_REPLY or CFG_SET; N being the number of included IP addresses
      ('Num addresses').

   o  S: Scope bit.  This bit controls whether the DNS queries are sent
      within the tunnel or outside.  If set, this bit instructs the
      initiator to send encrypted DNS queries outside the tunnel.  If
      the bit is unset, the queries are sent inside the tunnel.  The
      default value of this bit is "0".

   o  Encrypted DNS Type: Indicates the type of the encrypted DNS server
      conveyed in this attribute.  The following values are defined:

         0: Reserved

         1: DoT

         2: DoH

         See Section 8.2 for future assignment considerations.

   o  Num addresses: If Length > 1, it indicates the number of enclosed
      IP addresses.

   o  IPv6 Address(es): One or more IPv6 addresses to be used to reach
      the encrypted DNS identified by the name in the DNS Authentication
      Domain Name.

      IPv4 addresses MUST be encoded using the IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Address
      format defined in [RFC4291].

   o  Authentication Domain Name: A fully qualified domain name of the
      DoT (or DoH) server following the syntax defined in [RFC5890].
      The name MUST NOT contain any terminators (e.g., NULL, CR).

      An example of valid ADN for DoH server is "doh1.example.com".

5.  URI Template

   DoH servers may support more than one URI Template [RFC8484].  The
   following sub-sections discuss some candidate solutions for a DoH
   client to retrieve the list of supported templates by a DoH server.
   Also, if the resolver hosts several DoH services (e.g., no-filtering,
   blocking adult content, blocking malware), these services can be
   discovered as templates.

   This section will be updated to reflect the outcome of the discussion
   in [I-D.btw-add-home].

   How a DoH client makes use of the configured DoH services is out of
   the scope of this document.

6.  IKEv2 Protocol Exchange

   This section describes how an initiator can be configured with an
   encrypted DNS server (e.g., DoH, DoT) using IKEv2.

   Initiators indicate the support of an encrypted DNS in the
   CFG_REQUEST payloads by including INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute, while
   responders supply the encrypted DNS configuration in the CFG_REPLY
   payloads.  Concretely:

      If the initiator supports encrypted DNS, it includes one or more
      INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attributes in the CFG_REQUEST with the "Encrypted
      DNS Type" set to the requested encrypted DNS type (Section 4).
      For each supported encrypted DNS type the initiator MUST include
      exactly one INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute with the Length field set
      to 1.




Boucadair, et al.        Expires October 9, 2020                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft              IKEv2 for DoH/DoT                 April 2020


      If an INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute is included in the CFG_REQUEST,
      the INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute MUST NOT include an ADN and list of
      IP addresses.

      For each INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute from the CFG_REQUEST, if the
      responder supports the corresponding encrypted DNS type, then it
      MAY send back an INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute in the CFG_REPLY with
      this encrypted DNS type and an appropriate list of IP addresses
      and ADN.  The list of IP addresses MUST NOT be empty.

      If the CFG_REQUEST includes an INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute but the
      CFG_REPLY does not include an INTERNAL_ENC_DNS, this is an
      indication that requested encrypted DNS type(s) is not supported
      by the responder.

      The behavior of the responder if it receives both INTERNAL_ENC_DNS
      and INTERNAL_IP6_DNS (or INTERNAL_IP4_DNS) attributes is policy-
      based and deployment-specific.  However, it is RECOMMENDED that if
      the responder includes at least one INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute in
      the reply, it should not include any of INTERNAL_IP4_DNS/
      INTERNAL_IP6_DNS attributes.

   The DNS client establishes a DoH/DoT session with the address(es)
   conveyed in INTERNAL_ENC_DNS and uses the mechanism discussed in
   Section 8 of [RFC8310] to authenticate the DNS server certificate
   using the authentication domain name conveyed in INTERNAL_ENC_DNS.

   If the IPsec connection is a split-tunnel configuration and the
   initiator negotiated INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN as per [RFC8598], the DNS
   client MUST resolve the internal names using INTERNAL_ENC_DNS DNS
   servers.

      Note: [RFC8598] requires INTERNAL_IP6_DNS (or INTERNAL_IP4_DNS)
      attribute to be mandatory present when INTERNAL_DNS_DOMAIN is
      included.  This specification relaxes that constraint in the
      presence of INTERNAL_ENC_DNS attribute.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document adheres to the security considerations defined in
   [RFC7296].  In particular, this document does not alter the trust on
   the DNS configuration provided by a responder.

   Networks are susceptible to internal attacks as discussed in
   Section 3.2 of [I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t].  Hosting DoH/DoT
   server even in case of split-VPN configuration minimizes the attack
   vector (e.g., a compromised network device cannot monitor/modify DNS

   traffic).  This specification describes a mechanism to restrict
   access to the DNS messages to only the parties that need to know.

   In most deployment scenarios, the initiator expects that it is using
   the DoH/DoT server hosted by a specific organization or enterprise.
   The DNS client can validate the signatory (i.e., cryptographically
   attested by the organization hosting the DoH/DoT server) using, for
   example, [I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection], and the user can
   review human-readable privacy policy information of the DNS server
   and assess whether the DNS server performs DNS-based content
   filtering.  This helps to protect from a compromised IKE server
   advertising a malicious DoH/DoT server.

   The initiator may trust the DoH/DoT servers supplied by means of
   IKEv2 from a trusted responder more than the locally provided DNS
   servers, especially in the case of connecting to unknown or untrusted
   networks (e.g., coffee shops or hotel networks).  In addition, the
   initiator may prefer IKEv2-supplied DoH/DoT servers if they provide
   additional features (e.g., malware filtering) compared to the pre-
   configured DNS servers and meets the privacy preserving data policy
   requirements of the user.

   If the DoH/DoT server that was discovered by means of IKEv2 does not
   meet the privacy preserving data policy and filtering requirements of
   the user, the user can instruct the DNS client to take appropriate
   actions.  For example, the action can be to use the local DoH/DoT
   server only to access internal-only DNS names and use another DNS
   server (that addresses his/her expectations) for public domains.
   Such actions and their handling is out of scope.

   If IKEv2 is being negotiated with an anonymous or unknown endpoint
   (such as for Opportunistic Security [RFC7435]), the initiator MUST
   NOT use INTERNAL_ENC_DNS servers unless it is pre-configured in the
   OS or the browser.

   This specification does not extend the scope of accepting DNSSEC
   trust anchors beyond the usage guidelines defined in Section 6 of
   [RFC8598].

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Configuration Payload Attribute Type

   This document requests IANA to assign the following new IKEv2
   Configuration Payload Attribute Types from the "IKEv2 Configuration
   Payload Attribute Types" namespace available at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/ikev2-parameters/
   ikev2-parameters.xhtml#ikev2-parameters-21.

   Parameters" available at https://www.iana.org/assignments/ikev2-
   parameters/ikev2-parameters.xhtml#ikev2-parameters-21.  The initial
   values of the registry is as follows:

               +-------+----------------------+-----------+

   New values are assigned on a First Come, First Served (FCFS) basis
   (Section 4.4 of [RFC8126]).

9.  Acknowledgements

   Many thanks to Yoav Nir, Christian Jacquenet, Paul Wouters, and Tommy
   Pauly for the review and comments.

   Yoav and Paul suggested the use of one single attribute carrying both
   the name and an IP address instead of depending on the existing
   INTERNAL_IP6_DNS and INTERNAL_IP4_DNS attributes.
