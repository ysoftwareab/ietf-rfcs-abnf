1.  Introduction

   BGP Flow Specification (BGP-FS) [RFC5575]defines a new BGP NLRI to
   distribute traffic flow specification rules via BGP ([RFC4271]).
   BGP-FS policies have a match condition that may be n-tuple match in a
   policy, and an action that modifies the packet and forwards/drops the
   packet.  Via BGP, new filter rules can be sent to all BGP peers
   simultaneously without changing router configuration, and the BGP
   peer can install these routes in the forwarding table.  BGP-FS
   defines Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) format used to
   distribute traffic flow specification rules.  NLRI (AFI=1, SAFI=133)
   is for IPv4 unicast filtering.  NLRI (AFI=1, SAFI=134)is for BGP/MPLS
   VPN filtering.[I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn][I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-
   l2vpn] extends the flow-spec rules for layer 2 Ethernet packets.

   Segment Routing (SR) for unicast traffic has been proposed to cope
   with the usecases in traffic engineering, fast re-reroute, service
   chain, etc.  SR architecture can be implemented over an IPv6 data
   plane using a new type of Segment Routing Header
   (SRH)[I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] . SRv6 Network
   Programming[I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming] defined the
   SRv6 network programming concept and its most basic functions.  SRv6
   SID will have the form LOC:FUNCT:ARGS::.

   LOC: Each operator is free to use the locator length it chooses.
   Most often the LOC part of the SID is routable and leads to the node
   which instantiates that SID

   FUNCT: The FUNCT part of the SID is an opaque identification of a
   local function bound to the SID. (e.g.  End: Endpoint, End.X, End.T,
   End.DX2 etc.)

   ARGS: A function may require additional arguments that would be
   placed immediately after the FUNCT

   This document specifies a new subset of BGP-FS component types to
   support Segment Routing over IPv6 data plane (SRv6) filtering.

2.  Definitions and Acronyms

   o  FS: Flow Specification

   o  SR: Segment Routing

   o  SRv6: IPv6 Segment Routing, SRv6 is a method of forwarding IPv6
      packets on the network based on the concept of source routing.

   o  SID: Segment Identifier

   o  BSID: Binding SID

3.  The Flow Specification Encoding for SRv6

   This document proposes new flow specifications rules that is encoded
   in NLRI.  The following new component types are defined

   o  Whole SID

   Type TBD1 - Whole SID

   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length(1 octet), [op, value]+>

   Contains a set of {operator, value} pairs that are used to match the
   SID/binding SID or a range of whole SID.

   The operator byte is encoded as:

                          0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                        | e | a |lt |gt |eq |  reserve  |
                        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

   e - end-of-list bit.  Set in the last {op, value} pair in the list.

   a - AND bit.  If unset, the previous term is logically ORed with the
   current one.  If set, the operation is a logical AND.  It should be
   unset in the first operator byte of a sequence.  The AND operator has

   higher priority than OR for the purposes of evaluating logical
   expressions.

   lt - less than comparison between data and value.

   gt - greater than comparison between data and value.

   eq - equality between data and value.

   The bits lt, gt, and eq can be combined to produce match the SID or a
   range of SID(e.g. less than SID1 and greater than SID2).

   The value field is encoded as:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   ~                         SID(128bits)                          ~
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   The format of SID is described in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header] and
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming]

   o  Some bits of SID to match

   For some scenarios route policy with the whole128 bits SID matching
   is too long and not necessary.
   [I-D.filsfils-spring-srv6-network-programming] defined the format of
   SID is LOC:FUNCT:ARGS::. In some scenarios, traffic packets can just
   match Locator, Function ID, Argument or combine of these different
   fields rather than whole 128 bits SID.  This document defines a set
   of new component type TBD2 to reduce the length of matching.

   Type TBD2 - Some bits of SID

   Encoding: <type (1 octet), length(1 octet), [op, value]+>

   Contains a set of {operator, value} pairs that are used to match some
   bits of SID.

   The operator byte is encoded as:

                           0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                        | e | a |      type     |reserve|
                        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Where:

   e - end-of-list bit.  Set in the last {op, value} pair in the list.

   a - AND bit.  If unset, the previous term is logically ORed with the
   current one.  If set, the operation is a logical AND.  It should be
   unset in the first operator byte of a sequence.  The AND operator has
   higher priority than OR for the purposes of evaluating logical
   expressions.

   type:

   0000 : SID's LOC bits

   0001 : SID's FUNCT bits

   0010 : SID's LOC:FUNCT bits

   0011 : SID's FUNCT:ARGS bits

   The value field is encoded as SID with mask to match bits as type
   defined:

    0                   1                   2                   3

4.  Security Considerations

   No new security issues are introduced to the BGP protocol by this
   specification.

5.  IANA

   IANA is requested to a new entry in "Flow Spec component types
   registry" with the following values:

      |   Type  | RFC or Draft |    Description    |

      |   TBD1  |  This Draft  |        SID        |
      +--------------------------------------------+
      |   TBD2  |  This Draft  | Some bits of SID  |
