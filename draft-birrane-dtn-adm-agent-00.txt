                     draft-birrane-dtn-adm-agent-00

Abstract

   This document describes an Application Data Model (ADM) for an
   Asynchronous Management Protocol (AMP) Agent.  The AMP Agent
   represents a managed device in the Asynchronous Management
   Architecture.  This ADM identifies the Primitive Values, Computed
   values, Reports, Controls, Macros, Literals, Operators, and meta-data
   associated with an Agent.  The information outlined in this document
   MUST be supported by any software claiming to act as a managed device
   within the AMP.

1.  Introduction

   An Application Data Model (ADM) provides a guaranteed interface for
   the management of an application or protocol over the Asynchronous
   Management Protocol [AMP] that is independent of the nuances of its
   software implementation.  In this respect, the ADM is conceptually
   similar to the Managed Information Base (MIB) used by SNMP, but
   contains additional information relating to command opcodes and more
   expressive syntax for automated behavior.

Internet-Draft                  Agent ADM                    August 2015


   Agents within the Asynchronous Management Architecture [AMA]
   represent applications running on managed devices that are
   responsible for implementing the AMA services of configuration,
   reporting, control, and administration.

1.1.  Technical Notes

   o  This document describes Version 0.1 of the Agent ADM.

   o  The OID Root for this ADM is NOT correctly set.  A sample OID Root
      is used in this version of the specification and MAY change in
      future versions of this ADM.

   o  Currently, ADMs are organizing documents and not used to
      automatically generate software.  Future versions of this ADM
      should include a specification in a data modeling language (such
      as YANG) to better enable software generation.

   o  Agent applications MAY choose to ignore the name, description, or
      OID information associated with the component definitions within
      this ADM as these items are only used to provide human-readable
      information associated with user interfaces and may not be
      necessary on a deployed managed device.

1.2.  Scope

   This ADM specifies the globally unique identifiers and descriptions
   for all Values, Controls, Literals, and Operators associated with an
   AMP Agent.  Any implementation claiming compliance with an AMP Agent
   and communicating with an AMP Manager MUST be conformant with this
   specification.  That is, it must compute all identified data, perform
   identified controls/operators, and understand identified literals/
   metadata.

1.3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  OID Tree Identification

   The Managed Identifiers (MIDs) used with this ADM encapsulate OIDs
   within a globally managed OID tree.  The OID node from which all of
   the MIDs in this specification derive is called the "Agent ADM OID
   Root".  This section identifies this root in the overall OID tree.

   NOTE: This version of the Agent ADM uses a proxy Agent ADM Root that
   has NOT been assigned.  The Agent ADM Root in this version of the
   document is only used for experimental purposes and MAY change before
   the final release of this specification.

                          OID Tree Identification

   The subtree under the Agent ADM OID ROOT contains eight subbranches
   that capture metadata, Primitive Values, Computed Values, Reports,
   Controls, Literals, Macros, and Operators as illustrated in Figure 1.

2.1.  Nicknames

   The following managed nicknames are provided to generate compressed
   OIDs within the AMP.  Compressed OIDs enable shortening of common
   subtrees into a single numerical identifier to avoid the significant
   repetition incumbent with using OIDs from a common subtree.  The
   nicknames defined by this ADM are given in Table 1.

                       Table 1: Agent ADM Nicknames

2.2.  OID Shorthand

   The components in this specification are identified by their AMP MID
   value.  However, for easier traceability back to the OIDs
   encapsulated in MIDs, an OID string is also provided for each
   component.  These OID strings are provided in a shorthand that makes
   use of the nicknames defined in Table 1 and uses the form
   [nickname].relative-oid.

   For example, the OID String [4].3.2.1 corresponds to the OID
   2B060102030304030201, with 2B060102030304 being the expansion of
   nickname 04 and 030201 being the relative OID.

3.  Metadata Definitions

   ADM metadata consists of the items necessary to uniquely identify the
   ADM to Managers within the AMA.  This includes items such as the name
   of the ADM, its version, and any nicknames used within the ADM.

4.  Primitive Values

   Primitive Value definitions represent those values that MUST be
   collected by the AMP Agent.  Changing or updating Primitive Value
   definitions requires making changes to the AMP Agent application and/
   or its supporting firmware.

5.  Computed Values

   Computed Value definitions are expressions used to calculate data
   values, on the fly, from a set of other Computed Value definitions,
   Primitive Value definitions, or Literals using any of the Operations
   known to the Agent.

   The expressions that define a Computed Value item are represented by
   MID Collections (MCs), which are ordered listings of the MIDs
   representing the expression arranged in postfix notation.

   For example, the expression "# TRL Rules Defined" + "# SRL Rules
   Defined" would be represented as follows:


   Original Expression : NUM_TRL + NUM_SRL

6.  Reports

   A Report is a listing of data items including Primitive Value
   definitions, Computed Value definitions, and other Reports returned
   from an AMP Agent.  Similar to Computed Values, Report definitions
   are captured as a MID Collection (MC), which is the ordered set of
   MIDs identifying individual data items that comprise the report.

7.  Controls

   Controls represent well-known command opcodes that can be run by the
   Agent in response to direct requests by an AMP Manager, or in
   response to time- or state-based rules on the Agent itself.

   Note: There is no concept of a user-defined Control in the AMP
   system.  All Controls are well-documented in ADMs with specific
   definitions of their behavior.

   Controls may be (and often are) parameterized.  Parameters are
   captured as special extensions within the MID itself.  In cases where
   a given control accepts parameters, the MID flag byte will note that
   the encapsulated OID represents a parameterized OID and the OID will
   be augmented with the parameters for a specific instance of the
   Control, as described in [AMP].

7.1.  Summary

   The Controls known to an AMP Agent are listed in Table 6.

7.2.  Control Specification

7.2.1.  Overview

   This section lists the description, parameters, and reports generated
   for each Control specified in this ADM.

   The "DESCRIPTION" section lists the functional requirements of the
   Control when run on an Agent.

   The "PARAMETERS" section illustrates and describes the ordered set of
   data items provided to the Control, when run on the Agent.  A
   parameterized Control is represented in the AMP by a MID
   encapsulating a parameterized OID.  OID parameters are captured as a
   Data Collection (DC).
   The DC capturing these parameters is elided for clarity, as the DC is
   only the container used to transmit the parameters between the Agent
   and Manager and not expected as input to the Control itself.

   The "REPORTS GENERATED" section describes the format of any Reports
   sent from the Agent to a Manager as a result of running the Control.
   This section ONLY describes Reports that are specific to the Control.
   Cases where policy requires Agents to send summary Reports when
   Controls either run or fail to run due to error, are not considered
   in this section as they are not specific to any one Control.  Any
   Control summary reports should be as described in [AMP].
   Reports generated on an Agent by a Control will either be directly
   sent to the Manager executing the Control or otherwise batched and
   send with other Reports destined for the receiving Manager.  This
   behavior will be based on the policy associated with the AMP Agent
   and is not specified in this ADM.

7.2.2.  ADM Controls

7.2.2.1.  ListADMs

   DESCRIPTION
        The ListADMs control causes the Agent to produce a Report
        detailing the name of each ADM supported by the Agent.  When an
        ADM is listed in this Report, it means that the Agent claims
        full conformance with the components detailed in the listed ADM.

   PARAMETERS
        This control does not take any parameters.

        This control will generated a Report capturing the list of ADMs
        supported by this Agent.  The format for this Report is
        illustrated in Figure 2.

        Where:

           # ADMs
           The number of ADMs known to the agent.

           ADM N Name
           The human-readable string associated with the Nth ADM,
           captured as a NULL-terminated string.

7.2.3.  Computed Value Controls

7.2.3.1.  AddCompVal

   DESCRIPTION
        The AddCompVal Control configures a new Computed Value
        definition on the Agent.  The generated value should be read as
        Type ID = Def
        Upon successful receipt of the Computed Value definition, the
        Agent MUST store the definition and be able to calculate the
        value at some point in the future.  This capability MUST exist
        even through a reset of the Agent application.
        NOTE: It MUST be considered an error if the Id associated with
        the new Computed Value definition is already defined on the
        Agent with a different associated definition or type.  It MUST
        NOT be considered an error if the Agent already has configured
        the exact same Computed Value when this message is received.
        Put another way, this Control should be considered idempotent.

   PARAMETERS
        This Control accepts 3 parameters used to identify and define
        the new Computed Value.  The parameters for this control are
        illustrated in Figure 3.

        Where:

           Id =
           The MID value identifying the new Computed Value definition.
           This value may appear in future Computed Value definitions,
           Report definitions, or Expressions.

           Definition =
           The Expression used to calculate this Computed Value.

           Type =
           The data type of the Computed Value.  Note, this data type
           may be used to "cast" the value to something other than what
           is implied by the Expression.  For example, the Type of a
           Computed Value may be set to INT even if the defining
           Expression contains all floating-point values.
           The Type designation MUST be a numeric type, as the defining
           Expression is a set of mathematical functions on numeric
           types.

   REPORTS GENERATED
        This Control generates no Reports.

7.2.3.2.  DelCompVals

   DESCRIPTION
        The DelCompVals Control removes one or more Computed Value
        definitions from the Agent.  Upon successful receipt and run of
        this Control, the Agent MUST NOT store the definition of any
        identified Computed Values and MUST NOT recognize these Computed
        Values in the future, to include evaluating Expressions already
        in existence on the Agent.  An Agent MUST NOT remove a Computed
        Value that is defined by a supported ADM.

   PARAMETERS
        This Control accepts 1 parameter used to identify the set of
        Computed Values to be removed.  The parameters for this control
        are illustrated in Figure 4.

7.2.3.3.  ListCompVals

   DESCRIPTION
        The ListCompVals Control produces a listing of every Computed
        Value identifier (MID) known to the Agent.  A Computed Value is
        "known" by the Agent if it is defined in an ADM supported by the
        Agent, or was configured on the Agent by a run of the AddCompVal
        Control.

   PARAMETERS
        This Control takes no parameters.

   REPORTS GENERATED
        This Control will generate a Report capturing the list of
        Computed Value identifiers supported by this Agent.  The Report
        will be included in the next "Data Report" message sent by the
        Agent to the querying Manager.  The format for this Report is

7.2.4.  Report Controls

7.2.4.1.  AddRptDef

   DESCRIPTION
        The AddRptDef Control configures a new Report definition on the
        Agent.  A Report definition assigns a single MID value to
        represent an ordered collection of other MID values.  This
        ordered collection may include Primitive Values, Computed
        Values, and other Reports.
        Upon successful receipt of the Report definition, the Agent MUST
        store the definition and be able to produce this Report at some
        point in the future.  This capability MUST exist even through a
        reset of the Agent application.
        NOTE: It MUST be considered an error if the Id associated with
        the new Report definition is already defined on the Agent with a
        different associated definition or type.  It MUST NOT be
        considered an error if the Agent already has configured the
        exact same Report when this message is received.  Put another
        way, this Control should be considered idempotent.

   PARAMETERS
        This Control accepts 2 parameters used to identify and define
        the new Report.  The parameters for this control are illustrated
        in Figure 8.

                           +--------+------------+
                           | Rpt Id | Definition |
                           | [MID]  |    [MC]    |

                      Figure 8: AddRptDef Parameters

        Where:

           Rpt Id =
           The MID value identifying the new Report definition.

           Definition =
           The ordered collection of MID values to be included in the
           Report when it is generated.  When this Report is generated
           by an Agent, the values of each MID in this MC is included in
           the report.  However, the identifier for each item is NOT
           included in the Report.

   REPORTS GENERATED
        This Control generates no Reports.

7.2.4.2.  DelRptDefs

   DESCRIPTION
        The DelRptDefs Control removes one or more Report definitions
        from the Agent.  Upon successful receipt and run of this
        Control, the Agent MUST NOT produce the removed Reports and MUST
        NOT recognize these Reports in the future, to include rule
        actions requesting that the removed Reports be generated.  An
        Agent MUST NOT remove a Report that is defined by a supported
        ADM.

   PARAMETERS
        This Control accepts 1 parameter used to identify the set of
        Report definitions to be removed.  The parameters for this
        control are illustrated in Figure 9.

           identifier is not found on the Agent.

   REPORTS GENERATED
        This control generates no Reports.

7.2.4.3.  ListRptDefs

   DESCRIPTION
        The ListRptDefs Control produces a listing of every Report
        identifier (MID) known to the Agent.

   PARAMETERS
        This Control takes no parameters.

   REPORTS GENERATED
        This Control will generate a Report capturing the list of Report
        identifiers supported by this Agent.  The Report will be
        included in the next "Data Report" message sent by the Agent to
        the querying Manager.  The format for this Report is illustrated
        in Figure 10.

        sequence.
        Upon successful receipt of the Macro definition, the Agent MUST
        store the definition and be able to run this Macro at some point
        in the future.  This capability MUST exist even through a reset
        of the Agent application.
        NOTE: It MUST be considered an error if the Id associated with
        the new Macro definition is already defined on the Agent with a
        different associated definition or type.  It MUST NOT be
        considered an error if the Agent already has configured the

7.2.6.  TRL Controls

7.2.6.1.  AddTimeRule

   DESCRIPTION
        The AddTimeRule Control configures a new Time-Based Rule (TRL)
        definition on the Agent.  A TRL instructs the Agent to perform
        some Macro periodically over time, and to stop after so many
        runs of the Macro.
        Upon successful receipt of the TRL definition, the Agent MUST
        store the definition and be able to run this TRL at some point
        in the future.  This capability MUST exist even through a reset
        of the Agent application.  Additionally, through a reset, the
        Agent must remember the number of runs of the Macro, even if the
        periodic evaluation of the rule is offset by the time taken by
        the reset.
        NOTE: It MUST be considered an error if the Id associated with
        the new TRL definition is already defined on the Agent with a
        different associated definition.  It MUST NOT be considered an
        error if the Agent already has configured the exact same TRL
        when this message is received.  Put another way, this Control
        should be considered idempotent.

   PARAMETERS
        This Control accepts 5 parameters used to identify and define
        the new TRL.  The parameters for this Control are illustrated in
        Figure 20.

7.2.6.2.  DelTimeRules

   DESCRIPTION
        The DelTimeRules Control removes one or more TRL definitions
        from the Agent.  Upon successful receipt and run of this
        Control, the Agent MUST NOT run the removed TRLs and MUST NOT
        recognize these TRLs in the future.

7.2.7.  SRL Controls

7.2.7.1.  AddStateRule

   DESCRIPTION
        The AddStateRule Control configures a new State-Based Rule (SRL)
        definition on the Agent.  A SRL instructs the Agent to run some
        Macro when a given Predicate evaluates to true, and to stop
        after so many Predicate evaluations.  The Agent MUST evaluate
        the SRL Predicate every second.
        Upon successful receipt of the SRL definition, the Agent MUST
        store the definition and be able to run this SRL at some point
        in the future.  This capability MUST exist even through a reset
        of the Agent application.  Additionally, through a reset, the
        Agent must remember the number of evaluations of the SRL
        predicate, even if the periodic evaluation of the rule is offset
        by the time taken by the reset.
        NOTE: It MUST be considered an error if the Id associated with
        the new SRL definition is already defined on the Agent with a
        different associated definition.  It MUST NOT be considered an
        error if the Agent already has configured the exact same SRL
        when this message is received.  Put another way, this Control
        should be considered idempotent.

8.  Literals

   This section describes the standard set of Literals available to all
   AMP Agents.  Applications and protocols in other ADMs do not need to
   redefine these Literals, as they may be used in any expressions
   evaluated by any Agent.

8.1.2.  User UVAST

   DESCRIPTION
        The User VAST Literal is configured with information from a user
        in the system (via a Manager) to specify a specific unsigned
        Vast (64-bit Integer) for an AMP Agent.  This Literal should be
        preferred for any guaranteed unsigned value in the AMP as it
        uses the SDNV format to more efficiently convey smaller unsigned
        values.

   PARAMETERS
        The Literal accepts 1 parameters, as illustrated in Figure 31.

9.  Macros

   Macro definitions are ordered collections of Controls that can be
   sequentially run.  Each Control in a Macro MUST either be a non-
   parameterized Control, or a parameterized Control with parameters
   specified.  There is no capability to add parameters to a Control
   after it has been encapsulated in a Macro.

   The Controls that define a Macro item are represented by a MID
   Collection (MC).

11.  Parameterization Examples

   This section describes examples of parameterization within the AMP
   using examples from this ADM.

11.1.  AddCompVal Definition

   Consider the control "Add Computed Value Definition", which takes
   three parameters, given the following pseudo-code notation:

   AddCompVal(MID new_id, EXPR def, BYTE type)

   Where "new_id" is the MID of the newly created Computed Value
   definition, "def" is the Expression that is used to compute the
   value, and "type" is the enumeration of the resultant type of the
   value after it has been evaluated.

   Consider that we would like to use this Control to define the
   Computed Value "# of Rules" from Table 4.  The values for the
   parameters in this example would be as follows.
