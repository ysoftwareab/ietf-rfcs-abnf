         Proxy Mobile IPv6 extensions for flow mobility support
                draft-melia-netext-flow-mob-solution-01

Abstract

   The Netext WG has been recently rechartered to determine what Proxy
   Mobile IPv6 extensions are required for flow mobility support of a MN
   implementing the single IP interface hiding mechanism.  This document
   briefly introduces the single IP interface hiding mechanism and it
   derives the associated protocol operations to enable seamless flow
   mobility across multiple access networks.  These extensions are
   intended to allow such mobile nodes to send and receive IP packets on
   multiple physical media in a simultaneous and possibly discriminated
   manner when attached to a PMIPv6 domain.  A typical usage of these
   extensions is to perform downlink flow discrimination through
   multiple interfaces based on filtering rules (i.e. dedicate one MN
   physical media to VOIP traffic and another MN media to HTTP traffic).

   The proposed extensions to PMIPv6 attempt to increment in a backward
   compatible manner the current PMIPv6 specification.  In addition
   these extensions use, when possible, existing specifications related
   to multihoming support at IETF and conform to the problem statement
   of Netext Working Group.

1.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terminology:

   MIGID  Multi-interface Group ID: a set of physical interfaces (two or
      more) belonging to the same MN.  On the same MN multiple MIGID can
      be configured.

   NIC  Network Interface Card: it provides physical access to a
      networking medium and provides a low-level addressing system
      through the use of MAC addresses.

   Bonding  Ethernet bonding: is a computer networking arrangement in
      which two or more network interfaces on a host computer are
      combined for redundancy or increased throughput, the resulting
      logical IP interface is called bonding interface.

   MASTER  Master of the bonding device.

   SLAVE  Slave of the bonding device.

   UL Up Link: flows sent from the MN to the network.

   DL Down link: flows send from the network to the MN.


2.  Introduction

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in [RFC5213], provides network
   based mobility management to hosts connecting to a PMIPv6 domain.
   PMIPv6 introduces two functional entities, the Local Mobility Anchor
   (LMA) and the Mobility Access Gateway (MAG).  The MAG is the first
   layer-three hop detecting MN attachment and providing IP
   connectivity.  The LMA is the entity assigning one or more Home
   Network Prefix (HNP) to the MN and is the topological anchor for all
   traffic from/to the MN.

   PMIPv6 allows a MN to connect to the same PMIPv6 domain through
   multiple interfaces.  However in this case, PMIPv6 requires each
   interface to be assigned a set of distinct IPv6 address(es) and thus
   prevents from flow mobility capabilities.  The revised Netext charter
   imposes that the MN uses a single logical IP interface to hide the
   use of multiple wireless/wired media to the IP stack.  In this
   context the MN is requested to:

   o  configure the logical IP interface (master) and bind to this
      logical interface two or more wireless/wired physical media
      (slaves)

Internet-Draft                Flow Mobility                   March 2010


   o  perform layer two network attachment and co-ordinate neighbor
      discovery mechanisms

   o  configure one or more IPv4 and/or IPv6 HNP on the logical IP
      interface

   o  configure local policies for physical media selection for UL
      traffic

   o  send/receive triggers for flow mobility to/from the network and
      local policy update

   Configuration of a single logical IP interface strictly depends on
   the OS running in the MN.  In Linux/Unix systems virtual interfaces
   can be configured with the bonding technology.  Ethernet bonding (or
   NIC teaming in Windows OS) allows a host equipped with two or more
   Ethernet NICs to be connected to one or more layer two switch and to
   exploit the different NICs for different purposes being reliability,
   load balancing and bandwidth aggregation some of the possible use
   cases.  As an example, a host equipped with 4 NICs can configure its
   bonding module for reliability.  In case one of the NICs notifies a
   link failure the following one in the slaves list can take the relay.
   Alternatively a server, equipped with multiple NICs can be configured
   to optimize bandwidth aggregation.  For an exhaustive list of the
   different bonding modes in Linux please refer to the Ethernet bonding
   driver.  Under the Window OS the NDIS driver type can be used to
   create an NDIS Intermediate Driver.  Intermediate drivers sit in-
   between the MAC and IP layers and can control all traffic being
   accepted by the NIC card.

   Upon logical interface configuration the MN should perform network
   attachment and IPv6 neighbor discovery.  If we consider the Linux
   bonding interface, the logical interface (master) and the physical
   interfaces (slave) share the same MAC address.  The PMIPv6 domain
   where the MN is attaching to can only detect one interface and
   additional intelligence is required to notify the PMIPv6 domain that
   both physical interfaces need to be simultaneously connected to the
   same LMA.  In other words, if the MN attaches the physical interface
   IF1 and configures HNPA, when it attaches physical interface IF2 it
   should always configure HNPA and, accordingly, the LMA should record
   both bindings in the BCE (i.e. this is not an intra-technology
   handover).  Additionally, depending on the configured bonding mode,
   IPv6 neighbor discovery messages should be treated differently than
   data plane (e.g; bonding configured in round robin mode sends packets
   iterating across the interfaces).

   For IP address configuration the MN can exchange DHCP or ND
   signaling.  In case of ND signaling the MN should send RS messages



Melia & Mongazon-Cazavet  Expires September 9, 2010             [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                Flow Mobility                   March 2010


   and wait for unicast RA from the MAG.  For DHCP the MN sends a DHCP
   request to the MAG and waits for the DHCP reply carrying the HNP.  In
   both cases, as stated above, the bonding module (given the nature of
   the Ethernet environments where it usually operates) selects any of
   the physical interfaces to send out the packet.  This has
   shortcomings since each for the two links should be carrying DHCP/ND
   messages.  It seems intuitive that layer two interaction is required.

   Upon configuration of one or more HNP on the logical IP interface the
   MN needs to equally configure policies for media selection for UL
   packets routing.  Policies configuration can happen upon network
   attachment ( and transferred to the MN by means of layer two
   signaling) or dynamically via an external channel.  This document
   assumes that L2 signaling can carry such information and that PMIPv6
   signaling can convey the routing policies from/to the LMA to/from the
   MAG.  Along the same lines policies update can occur during the
   lifetime of a binding connection.  Update of such policies may result
   in moving ongoing flows from one access network to another access
   network.

   In principle a MN can have two or more NICs and one or more logical
   interface can be configured.  In this sense logical interface A can
   group IF1 and IF2 and logical interface B can group IF3 and IF4.  The
   document introduces therefore the concept of Multi Interface Group
   IDentifier (MIGID) (a logical set of physical interfaces of a MN) and
   provides the support of elementary operations (addition,
   modification, removal) on a group entity for a MN.  This terminology
   is expected to be more suited to the general multi-interface
   paradigm.  In case the terminal can signal to the network (e.g.
   during authentication procedures) the desired MIGID, the MAG will
   then transfer the MIGID to the LMA in the newly defined MIGID option.
   If this is not possible a default value (MIGID=0) is defined to
   represent all interfaces of a given MN (e.g. the user profile
   indicates that he is eligible for multi-interface support in the
   PMIPv6 domain and the MIGID is set to 0).


3.  OvervieW

   The functional usage of multi-interface MN capabilities in a PMIPv6
   domain is defined by the present specification in a flexible and
   multi-purpose manner.  This allows for various traffic processing in
   a PMIPv6 domain with multi-interface MN such as (but not limited to):
   traffic blocking, traffic load-balancing or traffic dissemination.
   To achieve this flexibility, this document uses the concept of
   "filter" to denote a unitary criteria that can be managed between a
   MAG and a LMA in relationship with a MN interface.  Unitary filters
   can be added, deleted and modified on a per multi-interface group

   basis.  Flexibility is achieved by allowing an arbitrary filter
   syntax (or grammar) as proposed in [MEXT].  The filter syntax is a
   matter of agreement between MAG and LMA entities.  For the sake of
   understanding, the "flow" and "filter" terminology shall be
   considered equivalent.

   The following Figure 1 depicts the general principles of PMIPv6
   extensions for flow mobility support as proposed by the present
   document.

            Figure 1: Multi-interface MN with PMIPv6 extensions

   When MN activates if1, MAG1selects the default multi-interface group.
   The MAG can learn the MIGID during network authentication as part of
   the authentication signaling or fetch the information from the user
   profile.  If the user is eligible for flow mobility service the MAG
   performs proxy registration toward the LMA including the flow
   mobility option and it can optionally provide filters (flow1) during
   registration (e.g. default filters can be stored in the user
   profile).  The LMA accepts proxy registration from MAG1 and allocates
   MN HNP according to the per MN prefix model.  Since proxy
   registration is requesting flow mobility support, LMA stores MAG1
   filters that come along with delivery to pCoA1.

   When MN activates if2, MAG2 selects the default multi-interface group
   (similarly to the steps described for if1) and performs proxy
   registration toward the LMA.  MAG2 can provide filters (flow2) during

   registration.  LMA accepts proxy registration from MAG2 and allocates
   MN HNP according to the per MN prefix model.  LMA stores MAG2 filters
   that come along with delivery to pCoA2.  The LMA should update the
   existing mobility session and append the parameters for if2.  That
   is, a single mobility session spans over two access networks as
   opposed to RFC 5213 baseline.

   Later on, when the LMA receives IP packets destinated to MN HNP, it
   attempts to match each IP packet against filters (flow1, flow2)
   stored for the MN HNP.  When a filter match is found (flow1 or
   flow2), the LMA performs the action for the IP packet in the context
   of the matching flow.  In particular if the IP packet is to be
   delivered, the LMA performs delivery using the pCoA associated to the
   filter (pCoA1 on flow1 or pCoA2 on flow2).

   LMA behavior is extended to allow simultaneous transmission of
   downlink (DL) flows to the mobile node across multiple physical
   interfaces.  For UL flows it is assumed that the MN can configure
   local policies based on user preferences, operator policies,
   applications requirements, etc...  This document does not make any
   assumption on the order in which rules should be considered neither
   if some policies have higher priority with respect to others.  This
   document further assumes that the MN is capable of transmitting
   policies to the MAG., either during network attachment or upon
   reception of specific layer two triggers (e.g.  Link going down).  In
   this case the MN is said to trigger the flow mobility procedure
   (please refer to the appendix on how filters can be transmitted to
   the MAG).

   Both LMA and MAG behaviors are extended to provide enhanced Proxy
   Binding management for multi-interface MN.  LMA shall support Binding
   Control Entries (BCE) of multi-interface type.  This includes the
   capability to refer to a MIGID and a set of filters in a BCE.  LMA
   shall support or delegate the downlink packet processing and delivery
   according to flow specifications.  Both MAG and LMA shall be able to
   manage flows on a per multi-interface group basis.  This document
   also assumes that the network can equally start a flow mobility
   procedure based, for instance, on network load conditions.


4.  Conceptual Data Structure

   This specification proposes to extend PMIPv6 to support multiple
   proxy CoAs per mobility session possibly associated with downlink
   transmission criteria using the flow concept.

   Upon MN attachment the MAG determines if the MN should be provided
   with multi-interface service and, if so, selects the flow



Melia & Mongazon-Cazavet  Expires September 9, 2010             [Page 8]

   configuration that should be put in place for packet delivery.  The
   MAG can learn this information through a policy store or using
   attachment-specific signaling.  Any of the method used by the MAG is
   however out of scope of this document.  If the MAG determines that
   the MN can use the multi-interface service it forms a PBU as per
   [RFC5213] and adds a Multi-interface Option (newly defined by this
   document) and possibly one or several Flow Identifier option(s) as
   defined in [MEXT].  The Multi-interface option aims at identifying
   (MIGID) and parameterizing the multi-interface group to be created/
   updated/deleted by the LMA on MAG demand.  The choice of
   identification of the multi-interface group follows the following
   rule:

   All PBUs with the same HNP and MIGID values belong to the same
   mobility session from the LMA perspective.

   In the current revision of the document, only the default multi-
   interface group is supported (id=0).  In addition, multi-interface
   group parameters are left for further study.


        Mobility Session 1                    Mobility Session 1
      +----------------------+              +---------------------+
      | HNP1   PCoA1 MIGID0  |   ========>  | HNP1   PCoA1 MIGID0 |
      +----------------------+              | HNP1   PCoA2 MIGID0 |
                                            +---------------------+



          Figure 2: Mobility session extended for multi-interface

   Figure 2 shows how the mobility session is extended to span the same
   HNP across multiple interfaces.  This updates the text in [RFC5213]
   where each single interface is managed under a different mobility
   session.  The MIGID, selected by MAG1 (corresponding to PCoA1) upon
   MN attachment, is stored at the LMA.  When the MN attaches to MAG2
   (corresponding to PCoA2) MAG2 selects the MIGID value either received
   as part of the attachment signaling or via the policy profile.  If
   both MAG1 and MAG2 MIGID and HNP values match then the LMA adds PCoA2
   -- migid0 to the already existing mobility session.

   It should be noted that the MAG, as per RFC 5213, must be able to
   obtain a mobile node's policy profile.  The following fields are
   mandatory: the mobile node's identifier (MN-Identifier) and the IPv6
   address of the local mobility anchor.  We further suggest to include
   the MIGID which should be used for default multi interface setup.  In
   case the MN is capable to signal the MIGID to the MAG upon attachment
   multiple MIGID can be stored at the LMA, each of them corresponding

   to a mobility session.  The policy profile can optionally contain
   default filters.

   The MAG treats the indication of multi-interface as an explicit
   indication of adding flows to the PBU if any.  Such flows can be
   learned for instance during MN access to the network or via the user
   profile.

   Upon reception of a PBU containing indication for multi-interface the
   LMA should perform a binding cache lookup and append the information
   to the found BCE.  Filters, if present, are extracted from the PBU
   and processed by the LMA.  The result of filters processing is
   returned in the PBA by the LMA on an individual basis.


5.  Detailed flow charts

   This section introduces detailed flow charts for multi-interface
   setup, renewal, filters modifications and interface removal/addition.

5.1.  Initial multi-interface setup

   Figure 3 shows the attachment of IF1 and subsequently the attachment
   of IF2.  IF1 and IF2 belong to the same MIGID (i.e. the default
   multi-interface group id 0).

   MAG1 upon MN attachment checks the MN's policy profile.  If the MN is
   eligible for multi-interface service it includes the MIGID value from
   the policy profile.  The multi interface option (defined in this
   document) is included in the PBU.  The LMA upon reception of the PBU
   creates a new mobility session and it includes the received
   parameters (e.g.  MIGID, filters).

   When MN attaches interface IF2 MAG2 retrieves the same MIGID from the
   MN's policy profile and it appends filters (e.g. specific to that
   access network).  The LMA performing the lookup to check if a
   mobility session already exists for the indicated MN_ID should update
   its binding cache and append the parameters for the new connection.
   The same HNP MUST be sent to the MAG via the PBA and advertised to
   the MN.  Please refer to the appendix for considerations on default
   route configuration.

5.3.  Multi-interface filters modification MN initiated

   Filters can also be modified upon reception of an external MAG
   trigger Figure 5 (in this case MN initiated).  From the PMIPv6 point
   of view, filters modification is carried by binding renewal semantics
   (HI=5).  The target multi-interface group is set by the MAG in the
   multi-interface option (MIGID field).  This allows MAG to modify at
   any time the downlink filters it is responsible for.  For a
   discussion on how MN can send modified triggers to the MAG please
   refer to the Annex discussion.  In this case the MN is also supposed
   to update its UL filters accordingly.

        Figure 5: Multi-interface filters modification MN initiated

5.4.  Multi-interface filters modification network initiated

   The MAG might receive network triggers as a request to move flows due
   for instance to changed QoS conditions.  To this end the MAG should
   send a PBU to the LMA including filters that can be potentially
   modified.  The LMA will respond with a PBA updating the cenessary
   filters.  While the procedure can be considered to add complexity, it
   does not require semantic changes to the current signalling.
   Additionally it should be noted that in the context of the 3GPP
   Evolved Packet System the EPS bearer is terminated at the S-GW,
   policy enforcement point and implementing the MAG funciotnality.
   Further specification will be carried on in the next revision of this
   document.

5.5.  Multi-interface interface removal

   Figure 7 shows how to remove an interface from a multi-interface
   group managed by a MAG for a given MN.  The target multi-interface
   group is set by the MAG in the multi-interface option (MIGID field).
   In this case it is supposed that all the existing flows are moved to
   IF2.

    Type
        TBA

    Length

        8-bit unsigned integer indicating the length of the option
        in octets, excluding the type and length fields.  This field
        MUST be set to 2.

    MIGID
        This 8 bit field identifies the multi-interface group the PBU/PBA refer to.
        The value 0 is reserved to the default multi-interface group which includes
        all interfaces of a MN. Only value 0 is currently supported.

    ACT

        This 3-bit field is used to provide optional action to be
        performed by LMA upon removal of an interface from a multi-interface
        group. The field shall only be set by the MAG when HI value in
        PBU is set to 4, otherwise the field shall be set to 0.
        The following bit values are currently defined:

         000: Reserved
         001: Remove filters
         010: Keep filters

    RFU (Reserved for Future Use)

        This 5-bit field is unused for now.  The value MUST be
        initialized to 0 by the sender and MUST be ignored by the
        receiver.

                     Figure 9: Multi-interface option

   The following considerations on the ACT field apply.  If 001 (Remove
   filters) is set on interface removal, the LMA shall remove all
   filters currently configured.  This might result in downlink traffic
   disruption.  If 010 (Keep filters) is set on interface removal, the
   LMA shall arrange to re-instantiate filters configured on the removed
   interface to existing filters (if any) of other interfaces of the
   multi-interface group if any.  This allows to avoid downlink traffic
   disruption.

   However, a filter that has been re-instantiated on a interface should
   be advertised by the LMA with a specific status of Flow identifier
   option whenever a MAG performs a filter operation the interface.

6.2.  Flow Identifier Option

   The FID option defined in ID [MEXT] is used in the current
   specification to manage downlink packet delivery across interfaces of
   a multi interface MN.  The option might be used by a MAG to create/
   modify/delete filter(s) on the LMA for a particular multi-interface
   group of a MN.  Upon successful processing and installation of
   filter(s) at LMA level an individual status (Status field) shall be
   returned to the MAG by the LMA.  The LMA should later evaluate
   packets destinated to a MN through filters installed by MAG(s) that
   are proxying the MN under the same mobility session.  The LMA must
   perform the action(s) associated to the matching filter(s).

   In case, the LMA re-instantiates flows on a multi-interface group
   toward a MAG for a given MN, the LMA shall perform the following
   processing:

   o  Allocate a unique FID to the re-instantiated filter within the
      context of existing filters for the multi-interface group of the
      MN toward the target LMA

   o  Set the PRO field to a new reserved value (2: flow binding re-
      instantiated by LMA) of [MEXT] as proposed by the current
      specification

   o  Copy FID-PRI and Action fields from the original filter into the
      re-instantiated filter

   The binding revocation mechanism can be used to indicate to the MAG
   that multi-interface service has changed.  Alternatively re-
   instantiated filter(s) will be returned by LMA only on MAG demand.
   This might happen when MAG renews PBU or create/modify/delete its own
   filters.

   The format of the option is briefly recalled hereafter.  The present
   specification proposes to extend the PRO field value in order to add
   the (2: flow binding re-instantiated by LMA) predefined value.  The
   full specification of the option can be found in [MEXT]

7.  MAG behavior

   The MAG upon MN attachment performs all the steps as per [RFC5213].
   In addition to this it MUST perform the following checks.

   The MAG learns if the MN is requesting a HNP as part of a new
   mobility session or if it is requesting to attach a new interface as
   part of an already existing mobility session.  The MAG retrieves the
   MIGID from e.g.  MN's profile as well as filters.  The MAG can learn
   filters in an access-specific manner or alternatively via other
   infrastructure support.  This is however out of scope of this
   document.  In any case the MAG MUST encode the PBU including at least
   the Multi-interface option as specified before and possibly one or
   more FID option(s).

   The MAG can modify or delete filters attached to a multi-interface
   group by sending a PBU carrying the filter operation(s) to be
   performed.  It shall analyze individual results according to what is
   returned by the LMA.  In addition, MAG should be prepared to handle
   filters that have been re-instantiated by LMA when MN has
   disconnected an interface belonging to the same multi-interface
   group.

   When MAG proxying a MN detects the MN has detached the related
   interface, MAG stops proxying the MN by sending a PBU with lifetime
   set to 0 and includes the multi-interface option that identifies the
   target multi-interface group of the detached interface as well as
   removal behavior regarding filters.  MAG waits for successful PBA to
   release the MN access.


8.  LMA behavior

8.1.  BCE modifications

   The LMA binding cache lookup method should be extended to accommodate
   multi-interface support.  In case the LMA processes the Multi-
   interface Option it SHOULD update existing mobility session as
   defined in [RFC5213].  In addition to this it MUST perform the
   following checks.

   If the Multi-interface option is present in the PBU, the LMA must
   allocate/update/delete the mobility session and the multi-interface
   group ID it refers to.  Flow filters received in the PBU shall be
   created/modified/deleted for the target Multi-interface group ID and
   a result shall be return on an individual filter basis.

   In addition, the LMA shall handle removal of interfaces from multi-
   interface group according to MAG instructions.  In particular, if a
   MAG instructs a LMA to remove an interface from a multi-interface
   group but to keep filters, the LMA should re-instantiate filters on
   existing interface(s) of the multi-interface group according to its
   own mechanisms.

   If a LMA does not support multi-interface extension (as a whole) or
   specific multi-interface option, as proposed by the present document,
   it shall return a status code in PBA as defined in [RFC5213].  The
   later specification might be extended to include multi-homing
   specific statuses, such as:

   MI_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_LMA

   MI_FILTERS_REINSTANCIATION_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_LMA

12.  Annex

   The following Annex discusses few issues related to MN-to-MAG
   signaling and MN configuration and it should open the floor for
   discussion.

12.1.  Options carried during attachment procedures

   This document makes the assumption that the MN policy profile stores
   the information on Multi-Interface Group ID.  The MN could optionally
   signal to the network the request to create a BCE at the LMA
   supporting multiple interfaces, for instance as part of the EAP
   exchange.  Further revisions of this document will detail how this
   can be achieved.

12.2.  Singalling to convey filters to the MAG

   IEEE 802.21 signaling can be used to carry filters from the MN to the
   MAG.  IETF standardized IP transport for MIH packets.  One could
   leverage the vendor specific options in the MIH packet to convey to
   the MAG the required filters.  It should be noted that the IEEE
   802.21 framework suggests to deploy MIH Point of Service together
   with the MAG functionality.  Further revisions of this document will
   detail how this can be achieved.

12.3.  Experimenting the bonding interface

   The following testbed has been setup:

                       Figure 11: Test network setup

   The MN implements the bonding interface.  Linux kernel provides a
   module called "bonding" to group together several interfaces (or
   "slaves", in the module's terminology) that will have the same L2 and
   L3 address and figure out to be as just one interface.  The module
   offers the possibility to select the transmitting slave according to
   per-configured policies.  Unfortunately these policies don't cover
   the scope of flow management so the module has to be extended to
   allow an external input to select the transmitting slave.

   Attachment of the bonding MN should be helped by layer two support to
   avoid modifications to the ND protocol.  L2 attachment procedures
   should trigger the PBU in the MAG.  Further when the LMA receives a
   PBU from a MAG for a Proxy Registration, it may find that the BCE
   already exists with a different CoA, as that CoA is the address of
   the MAG to which another interface of the same MN is attached.  This
   may be interpreted as an unexpected handover if the handoff indicator
   field isn't properly set.  The Access Technology Type in conjunction
   with a new value of the HI field in the PBU might be used to avoid
   conflicts in the registration.  The correct behavior for the LMA
   would lead to a new tunnel creation in order to allow the MN to be

   reached via all the MAGs to which the MN's interfaces are attached.
   That's why the BCE format must be extended too to contain multiple
   CoAs and tunnel identifiers.
