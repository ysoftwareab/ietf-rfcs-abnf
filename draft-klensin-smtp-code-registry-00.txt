Abstract

   The specification for enhanced mail system status codes, RFC 3463,
   establishes a new code model and lists a collection of codes.  While
   it anticipated that more codes would be added over time, it did not
   provide an explicit mechanism for registering and tracking those
   codes.  This document specifies an IANA registry for enhanced mail
   system status codes, initializing that registry with the codes so far
   established in published standards-track documents.

Internet-Draft              SMTP Status Codes                 April 2007


1.  Introduction

   The specification for enhanced mail system status codes, RFC 3463
   [1], establishes a new code model and lists a collection of codes.
   While it anticipated that more codes would be added over time (see
   its Section 2), it did not provide an explicit mechanism for
   registering and tracking those codes.  This document specifies an
   IANA registry for enhanced mail system status codes, initializing
   that registry with the codes so far established in published
   standards-track documents.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

1.1.  Note in Draft

   RFC Editor: please remove this section before publication.

   This document is based on the recommendations of the working draft
   about IANA considerations [6] rather than the published, but somewhat
   dated, version [7].  Should it complete Last Call before there is
   action on the I-D, references to the published form will be
   retrofitted.


2.  A New Registry

2.1.  Registry Name

   This registry will be known as "SMTP Enhanced Status Codes"

2.2.  Information Required

   A registration will consider of four items:

   1.  A numeric code, consisting of three components, as specified in
       RFC 3463.

   2.  Text expected to be associated with the code, as specified in RFC
       3463.

   3.  A short description of the code, including the basic reply code
       of RFC 2821 [3] with which it is associated.

   4.  A reference to the document in which the code is defined.  This
       reference should note whether the relevant specification is
       standards-track or not.

   5.  The identity of the submitter or registrant ("IESG" in the case
       of IETF-produced documents).

2.3.  Review Process for New Values

   Entries in this registry are expected to follow the "Specification
   Required", model although, in practice, most entries are expected to
   derive from standards-track documents.  However, any review process
   for non-standards-track documents SHOULD accept evidence of
   significant deployment as a a persuasive argument that the
   registration should be permitted: the principal purpose of this
   registry is ultimately to avoid confusion and conflicts among
   different definitions or uses for the same code.

2.4.  Registration Updates

   Standards-track registrations may be updated if the relevant
   standards are updated, and as a consequence of that action.  Other
   registration entries may be updated with regard to short descriptions
   and references at the request of the party requesting the original
   registration but not with regard to the code or associated text.  In
   exceptional cases, any registered entity may be updated at the
   direction of the IESG.


3.  Initial Values

   As discussed above, a registry should be created for extended SMTP
   reply codes.  That registry should initially be populated with the
   codes specified in RFC 3463 [1], RFC 3886 [4], and updated as
   specified above.  Documents presently in IESG evaluation or the RFC
   editor queue which update RFC 3463 can also provide initial values
   for this registry or should be used as a basis for updating it when
   they are approved and published.


4.  Acknowledgements

   While the need for this registry should have become clear shortly
   after RFC 3463 was approved, the growth of the code table through
   additional documents and work done as part of email
   internationalization and RFC 2821 updating efforts made the
   requirement much more clear.  The comments of the participants in
   those efforts are gratefully acknowledged.  Chris Newman provided
   useful comments and some text for a preliminary version of the
   document.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies creation of a new registry and the initial
   values with which it is to be populated.


6.  Security Considerations

   Many proposed additions to the response code list are security
   related.  Having these registered in one place to prevent collisions
   will improve their value.  Security error responses can leak
   information to active attackers (e.g., the distinction between "user
   not found" and "bad password" during authentication).  Documents
   defining security error codes should make it clear when this is the
   case so SMTP server software subject to such threats can provide
   appropriate controls to restrict exposure.
