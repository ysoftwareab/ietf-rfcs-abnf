   This document describes how to add geographic location in syslog.  It
   defines a STRUCTURED-DATA to add latitude, longitude and altitude in
   the syslog message.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The key words "STRUCTURED-DATA", "SD-ID", "SD-PARAM", "PARAM-NAME",
   "PARAM-VALUE" are to be interpreted as described in
   [I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol].


2.  Introduction

   An increasing number of network and security devices are becoming
   more mobile in their environment.  Those mobile devices are now able
   to gather information like latitude and longitude about their
   respective geographic location.  We use the STRUCTURED-DATA available
   in the syslog protocol to provide easily parseable geographic meta
   information.

   This memo defines a new SD-ID named "geo".  The PARAM-NAMEs are
   latitude, longitude and altitude.  PARAM-VALUEs are described below.
   The parameters have no influence in the existing parameters described
   in section 7 of [I-D.ietf-syslog-protocol].  Support of "geo" SD-ID
   is OPTIONAL.  All SD-PARAMs are OPTIONAL.

2.1.  latitude

   The latitude parameter contains the decimal latitude in the World
   Geodetic System 84 (WGS84) reference [NIMA TR8350.2].

   If the latitude is unknown, the latitude parameter MUST NOT be
   present.

2.2.  longitude

   The longitude parameter contains the decimal longitude in the World
   Geodetic System 84 (WGS84) reference [NIMA TR8350.2].

   If the longitude is unknown, the longitude parameter MUST NOT be
   present.

2.3.  altitude

   The altitude contains the decimal altitude in the World Geodetic
   System 84 (WGS84) reference [NIMA TR8350.2].

   If the altitude is unknown, the altitude parameter MUST NOT be

   present.


3.  Example

   The example shows only the structured data part in SD-ID "geo" of a
   syslog message with only a known latitude and longitude.  The message
   is valid.

   [geo latitude="49.70475" longitude="5.42373"]

   The example shows only the structured data part in SD-ID "geo" of a
   syslog message with no SD-PARAM.  The message is valid but the sender
   is unable to obtain is geographic location.

   [geo]


4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in syslog protocol applies when
   using the geographic location.

4.1.  Location Privacy

   Location information of the syslog sender can be used by attackers to
   easily locate sender when observing the syslog message.  Operators
   are advised to use a secure transport mapping to avoid such
   observation.

4.2.  Location Modification

   Because message integrity is not guarantee in syslog message, an
   attacker may maliciously modify the location.  Operators are advised
   to use other means for validating the integrity of the location.


5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the SD-IDs and the PARAM-NAMEs
   described below :
