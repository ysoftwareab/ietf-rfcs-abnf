1.  Introduction

   The LISP Data-Plane is defined in [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis].  It
   specifies an encapsulation format that carries IPv4 or IPv6 packets
   (henceforth jointly referred to as IP) in a LISP header and outer
   UDP/IP transport.

   The LISP Data-Plane header does not specify the protocol being
   encapsulated and therefore is currently limited to encapsulating only
   IP packet payloads.  Other protocols, most notably Virtual eXtensible
   Local Area Network (VXLAN) [RFC7348] (which defines a similar header
   format to LISP), are used to encapsulate Layer-2 (L2) protocols such
   as Ethernet.

   This document defines an extension for the LISP header, as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis], to indicate the inner protocol, enabling
   the encapsulation of Ethernet, IP or any other desired protocol all
   the while ensuring compatibility with existing LISP deployments.

Internet-Draft       LISP Generic Protocol Extension      September 2018


   A flag in the LISP header, called the P-bit, is used to signal the
   presence of the 8-bit Next Protocol field.  The Next Protocol field,
   when present, uses 8 bits of the field allocated to the echo-noncing
   and map-versioning features.  The two features are still available,
   albeit with a reduced length of Nonce and Map-Version.

   LISP-GPE MAY also be used to extend the LISP Data-Plane header, that
   has allocated all by defining a Next Protocol "shim" header that
   implements new data plane functions not supported in the LISP header.
   As an example, the use of the Network Service Header (NSH) with LISP-
   GPE, can be considered an extension to add support in the Data-Plane
   for Network Service Chaining functionalities.

1.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Definition of Terms

   This document uses terms already defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis].

2.  LISP Header Without Protocol Extensions

   As described in Section 1, the LISP header has no protocol identifier
   that indicates the type of payload being carried.  Because of this,
   LISP is limited to carrying IP payloads.

   The LISP header [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis] contains a series of flags
   (some defined, some reserved), a Nonce/Map-version field and an
   instance ID/Locator-status-bit field.  The flags provide flexibility
   to define how the various fields are encoded.  Notably, Flag bit 5 is
   the last reserved bit in the LISP header.

3.  Generic Protocol Extension for LISP (LISP-GPE)

   This document defines two changes to the LISP header in order to
   support multi-protocol encapsulation: the introduction of the P-bit
   and the definition of a Next Protocol field.  This is shown in
   Figure 2 and described below.

                         Figure 2: LISP-GPE Header

   P-Bit:  Flag bit 5 is defined as the Next Protocol bit.

      If the P-bit is clear (0) the LISP header conforms to the
      definition in [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis].

      The P-bit is set to 1 to indicate the presence of the 8 bit Next
      Protocol field.



   Nonce/Map-Version:  In [I-D.ietf-lisp-6834bis], LISP uses the lower
      24 bits of the first word for a nonce, an echo-nonce, or to
      support map- versioning.  These are all optional capabilities that
      are indicated in the LISP header by setting the N, E, and V bits
      respectively.

Internet-Draft       LISP Generic Protocol Extension      September 2018


      When the P-bit and the N-bit are set to 1, the Nonce field is the
      middle 16 bits (i.e., encoded in 16 bits, not 24 bits).  Note that
      the E-bit only has meaning when the N-bit is set.

      When the P-bit and the V-bit are set to 1, the Version fields use
      the middle 16 bits: the Source Map-Version uses the high-order 8
      bits, and the Dest Map-Version uses the low-order 8 bits.

      When the P-bit is set to 1 and the N-bit and the V-bit are both 0,
      the middle 16-bits MUST be set to 0 on transmission and ignored on
      receipt.

      The encoding of the Nonce field in LISP-GPE, compared with the one
      used in [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis] for the LISP data plane
      encapsulation, reduces the length of the nonce from 24 to 16 bits.
      As per [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis], Ingress Tunnel Routers (ITRs)
      are required to generate different nonces when sending to
      different Routing Locators (RLOCs), but the same nonce can be used
      for a period of time when encapsulating to the same Egress Tunnel
      Router (ETR).  The use of 16 bits nonces still allows an ITR to
      determine to and from reachability for up to 64k RLOCs at the same
      time.

      Similarly, the encoding of the Source and Dest Map-Version fields,
      compared with [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis], is reduced from 12 to 8
      bits.  This still allows to associate 256 different versions to
      each Endpoint Identifier to Routing Locator (EID-to-RLOC) mapping
      to inform commmunicating ITRs and ETRs about modifications of the
      mapping.

   Next Protocol:  The lower 8 bits of the first 32-bit word are used to
      carry a Next Protocol.  This Next Protocol field contains the
      protocol of the encapsulated payload packet.

      This document defines the following Next Protocol values:



      0x1 :  IPv4

      0x2 :  IPv6

      0x3 :  Ethernet

      0x4 :  Network Service Header (NSH) [RFC8300]

      The values are tracked in an IANA registry as described in
      Section 5.1.

3.1.  Payload Specific Transport Interactions

   To ensure that protocols that are encapsulated in LISP-GPE will work
   well from a transport interaction perspective, the specification of a
   new encapsulated payload MUST contain an analysis of how LISP-GPE
   SHOULD deal with outer UDP Checksum, DSCP mapping, and Explicit
   Congestion Notification (ECN) bits whenever they apply to the new
   encapsulated payload.

   For IP payloads, section 5.3 of [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis] specifies
   how to handle UDP Checksums encouraging implementors to consider UDP
   checksum usage guidelines in section 3.4 of [RFC8085] when it is
   desirable to protect UDP and LISP headers against corruption.  Each
   new encapsulated payloads, when registered with LISP-GPE, MUST be
   accompanied by a similar analysis.

   Encapsulated payloads may have a priority field that may or may not
   be mapped to the DSCP field of the outer IP header (part of Type of
   Service in IPv4 or Traffic Class in IPv6).  Such new encapsulated
   payloads, when registered with LISP-GPE, MUST be accompanied by an
   analysis similar to the one performed in Section 3.1.1 of this
   document for Ethernet payloads.

   Encapsulated payloads may have Explicit Congestion Notification
   mechanisms that may or may not be mapped to the outer IP header ECN
   field.  Such new encapsulated payolads, when registered with LISP-
   GPE, MUST be accompanied by a set of guidelines derived from
   [RFC6040].

   The rest of this section specifies payload specific transport
   interactions considerations for the two new LISP-GPE encapsulated
   payloads specified in this document: Ethernet and NSH.

3.1.1.  Payload Specific Transport Interactions for Ethernet
        Encapsulated Payloads

   The UDP Checksum considerations specified in section 5.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis] apply to Ethernet Encapsulated Payloads.
   Implementors are encouraged to consider the UDP checksum usage
   guidelines in section 3.4 of [RFC8085] when it is desirable to
   protect UDP, LISP and Ethernet headers against corruption.

   When a LISP-GPE router performs Ethernet encapsulation, the inner
   802.1Q [IEEE.802.1Q_2014] priority code point (PCP) field MAY be
   mapped from the encapsulated frame to the Type of Service field in
   the outer IPv4 header, or in the case of IPv6 the 'Traffic Class'
   field.

Internet-Draft       LISP Generic Protocol Extension      September 2018


   When a LISP-GPE router performs Ethernet encapsulation, the inner
   header 802.1Q [IEEE.802.1Q_2014] VLAN Identifier (VID) MAY be mapped
   to, or used to determine the LISP Instance IDentifier (IID) field.

3.1.2.  Payload Specific Transport Interactions for NSH Encapsulated
        Payloads

   The UDP Checksum considerations specified in section 5.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis] apply to NSH Encapsulated Payloads.
   Implementors are encouraged to consider the UDP checksum usage
   guidelines in section 3.4 of [RFC8085] when it is desirable to
   protect UDP, LISP, and NSH headers against corruption.

   When a LISP-GPE router performs an NSH encapsulation, DSCP and ECN
   values MAY be mapped as specified for the Next Protocol encapsulated
   by NSH (namely IPv4, IPv6 and Ethernet).

4.  Backward Compatibility

   LISP-GPE uses the same UDP destination port (4341) allocated to LISP.

   The next Section describes a method to determine the Data-Plane
   capabilities of a LISP ETR, based on the use of the "Multiple Data-
   Planes" LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF) type defined in
   [RFC8060].  Other mechanisms can be used, including static ETR/ITR
   (xTR) configuration, but are out of the scope of this document.

   When encapsulating IP packets to a non LISP-GPE capable router the
   P-bit MUST be set to 0.  That is, the encapsulation format defined in
   this document MUST NOT be sent to a router that has not indicated
   that it supports this specification because such a router would
   ignore the P-bit (as described in [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis]) and so
   would misinterpret the other LISP header fields possibly causing
   significant errors.

   A LISP-GPE router MUST NOT encapsulate non-IP packets (that have the
   P-bit set to 1) to a non-LISP-GPE capable router.

4.1.  Use of "Multiple Data-Planes" LCAF to Determine ETR Capabilities

   LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF) [RFC8060] defines the "Multiple
   Data-Planes" LCAF type, that can be included by an ETR in a Map-Reply
   to encode the encapsulation formats supported by a given RLOC.  In
   this way an ITR can be made aware of the capability to support LISP-
   GPE, as well as other encapsulations, on a given RLOC of that ETR.

   The 3rd 32-bit word of the "Multiple Data-Planes" LCAF type, as
   defined in [RFC8060], is a bitmap whose bits are set to one (1) to

Internet-Draft       LISP Generic Protocol Extension      September 2018


   represent support for each Data-Plane encapsulation.  The values are
   tracked in an IANA registry as described in Section 5.2.

   This document defines bit 24 in the third 32-bit word of the
   "Multiple Data-Planes" LCAF as:

   g-Bit:  The RLOCs listed in the Address Family Identifier (AFI)
      encoded addresses in the next longword can accept LISP-GPE
      (Generic Protocol Extension) encapsulation using destination UDP
      port 4341

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  LISP-GPE Next Protocol Registry

   IANA is requested to set up a registry of LISP-GPE "Next Protocol".
   These are 8-bit values.  Next Protocol values in the table below are
   defined in this document.  New values are assigned via Standards
   Action [RFC8126].  The protocols that are being assigned values do
   not themselves need to be IETF standards track protocols.

              +---------------+-------------+---------------+
              | Next Protocol | Description | Reference     |

              +---------------+-------------+---------------+

5.2.  Multiple Data-Planes Encapsulation Bitmap Registry

   IANA is requested to set up a registry of "Multiple Data-Planes
   Encapsulation Bitmap" to identify the encapsulations supported by an
   ETR in the Multiple Data-Planes LCAF Type defined in [RFC8060].  The
   bitmap is the 3rd 32-bit word of the Multiple Data-Planes LCAF type.
   Each bit of the bitmap represents a Data-Plane Encapsulation.  New
   values are assigned via Standards Action [RFC8126].

   Bits 0-23 are unassigned.  This document assigns bit 24 (g-bit) to
   LISP-GPE.  Bits 25-31 are assigned in [RFC8060]).

6.  Security Considerations

   LISP-GPE security considerations are similar to the LISP security
   considerations and mitigation techniques documented in [RFC7835].

   The Echo Nonce Algorithm described in [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis]
   relies on the nonce to detect reachability from ITR to ETR.  In LISP-
   GPE the use of a 16-bit nonce, compared with the 24-bit nonce used in
   LISP, increases the probability of an off-path attacker to correctly
   guess the nonce and force the ITR to believe that a non-reachable
   RLOC is reachable.  However, the use of common anti-spoofing
   mechanisms such as uRPF prevents this form of attack.

   LISP-GPE, as many encapsulations that use optional extensions, is
   subject to on-path adversaries that by manipulating the g-Bit and the
   packet itself can remove part of the payload.  Typical integrity
   protection mechanisms (such as IPsec) SHOULD be used in combination
   with LISP-GPE by those protocol extensions that want to protect from
   on-path attackers.

   With LISP-GPE, issues such as data-plane spoofing, flooding, and
   traffic redirection may depend on the particular protocol payload
   encapsulated.
