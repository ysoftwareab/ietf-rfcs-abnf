                 Limited Domains and Internet Protocols
                   draft-carpenter-limited-domains-03

Abstract

   There is a noticeable trend towards network requirements, behaviours
   and semantics that are specific to a limited region of the Internet
   and a particular set of requirements.  Policies, default parameters,
   the options supported, the style of network management and security
   requirements may vary.  This document reviews examples of such
   limited domains and emerging solutions, and develops a related
   taxonomy.  It shows the needs for a precise definition of a limited
   domain boundary and for a corresponding protocol to allow nodes to
   discover where such a boundary exists.

1.  Introduction

   As the Internet continues to grow and diversify, with a realistic
   prospect of tens of billions of nodes being connected directly and
   indirectly, there is a noticeable trend towards local requirements,
   behaviours and semantics.  The word "local" should be understood in a
   special sense, however.  In some cases it may refer to geographical
   and physical locality - all the nodes in a single building, on a
   single campus, or in a given vehicle.  In other cases it may refer to
   a defined set of users or nodes distributed over a much wider area,
   but drawn together by a single virtual network over the Internet, or
   a single physical network running partially in parallel with the
   Internet.  We expand on these possibilities below.  To capture the
   topic, this document refers to such networks as "limited domains".

   Some people have concerns about splintering of the Internet along
   political or linguistic boundaries by mechanisms that block the free
   flow of information across the network.  That is not the topic of
   this document, which does not discuss filtering mechanisms and does
   not apply to protocols that are designed for use across the whole
   Internet.  It is only concerned with domains that have specific
   technical requirements.

   The word "domain" in this document does not refer to naming domains
   in the DNS, although in some cases a limited domain might
   incidentally be congruent with a DNS domain.

   The requirements of limited domains will be different in different
   scenarios.  Policies, default parameters, and the options supported
   may vary.  Also, the style of network management may vary, between a
   completely unmanaged network, one with fully autonomic management,
   one with traditional central management, and mixtures of the above.
   Finally, the requirements and solutions for security and privacy may
   vary.

   This documents analyses and discusses some of the consequences of
   this trend, and how it impacts the idea of universal interoperability
   in the Internet.  In particular, we challenge the notion that all
   Internet standards must be universal in scope and applicability.  To
   the contrary, we assert that some standards need to be specifically
   limited in their applicability.  This requires that the concepts of a
   limited domain, and of its boundary, need to be formalised.

2.  Failure Modes in Today's Internet

   Today, the Internet does not have a well-defined concept of limited
   domains.  One result of this is that certain protocols and features
   fail on certain paths.  Previously, this has been analysed in terms
   of transparency [RFC2775], [RFC4924] or of intrusive middleboxes
   [RFC3234], [RFC7663], [I-D.dolson-plus-middlebox-benefits].
   Unfortunately the problems persist, both in application protocols,
   and even in very fundamental mechanisms.  For example, the Internet
   is not transparent to IPv6 extension headers [RFC7872], and Path MTU
   Discovery has been unreliable for many years [RFC2923], [RFC4821].
   IP fragmentation is also unreliable
   [I-D.bonica-intarea-frag-fragile], and problems in TCP MSS
   negotiation have been reported [I-D.andrews-tcp-and-ipv6-use-minmtu].

   On the security side, the widespread insertion of firewalls at domain
   boundaries that are perceived by humans but unknown to protocols
   results in arbitrary failure modes as far as the application layer is
   concerned.

   This situation is not acceptable, so it seems that a new approach is
   needed.

3.  Examples of Limited Domain Requirements

   This section describes various examples where limited domain
   requirements can easily be identified.  It is of course not a
   complete list.

   NOTE: The authors welcome more suggestions and references for this
   list.

   1.   A home network.  It will be unmanaged, constructed by a non-
        specialist, and will possibly include wiring errors such as
        physical loops.  It must work with devices "out of the box" as
        shipped by their manufacturers and must create adequate security
        by default.  Remote access may be required.  The requirements
        and applicable principles are summarised in [RFC7368].

   2.   A small office network.  This is very similar to a home network,
        since whoever is in charge will probably have little or no
        specialist knowledge, but may have differing security and
        privacy requirements.  Remote access may be required.

   3.   A vehicle network.  This will be designed by the vehicle
        manufacturer but may include devices added by the vehicle's
        owner or operator.  Parts of the network will have demanding
        performance and reliability requirements with implications for
        human safety.  Remote access may be required to certain
        functions, but absolutely forbidden for others.  Communication
        with other vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and external data
        sources will be required.  See
        [I-D.ietf-ipwave-vehicular-networking] for a survey of use
        cases.

   4.   A building services network.  This will be designed specifically
        for a particular building, but using standard components.
        Additional devices may need to be added at any time.  Parts of
        the network may have demanding reliability requirements with
        implications for human safety.  Remote access may be required to
        certain functions, but absolutely forbidden for others.
        [I-D.martocci-6lowapp-building-applications] (need current
        reference!)

   5.   Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks in
        general, which will exhibit widely differing requirements,
        including tough real-time performance targets, of which building

Internet-Draft               Limited Domains              September 2018


        networks are a simple example.  See for example
        [I-D.ietf-detnet-use-cases]

   6.   The three preceding cases will all include sensors, but some
        networks may be specifically limited to sensors and the
        collection and processing of sensor data.  They may be in remote
        or technically challenging locations and installed by non-
        specialists.

   7.   "Traditional" enterprise and campus networks, which may be
        spread over many kilometres and over multiple separate sites.

   8.   Data centres and hosting centres, or distributed services acting
        as such centres.  These will have high performance, security and
        privacy requirements and will typically include large numbers of
        independent "tenant" networks overlaid on shared infrastructure.

   9.   Content Delivery Networks, comprising distributed data centres
        and the paths between them, spanning thousands of kilometres.

   10.  Internet of Things (IoT) networks.  While this term is very
        flexible and covers many innovative types of network, including
        ad hoc networks that are formed spontaneously, it seems
        reasonable to expect that many IoT edge networks will have
        special requirements and protocols that are useful only within a
        specific domain, and that these protocols cannot, and for
        security reasons should not, run over the Internet as a whole.

   11.  An important subclass of IoT networks consists of constrained
        networks [RFC7228] in which the nodes are limited in power
        consumption and communications bandwidth, and are therefore
        limited to using very frugal protocols.

   12.  Delay tolerant networks may consist of domains that are
        relatively isolated and are connected only intermittently to the
        outside, with a very long latency on such connections [RFC4838].
        Clearly the protocol requirements and possibilities are very
        specialised in such networks.

   13.  Many of the above types of network may be extended throughout
        the Internet by a variety of virtual private network (VPN)
        techniques.  Therefore we may argue that limited domains may
        overlap each other in an arbitrary fashion by use of
        virtualization techniques.

   Two other concepts, while not tied to specific network types, also
   strongly depend on the concept of limited domains:

Internet-Draft               Limited Domains              September 2018


   1.  Intent Based Networking.  In this concept, a network domain is
       configured and managed in accordance with an abstract policy
       known as "Intent", to ensure that the network performs as
       required [I-D.moulchan-nmrg-network-intent-concepts].  Whatever
       technologies are used to support this, they will be applied
       within the domain boundary.

   2.  Network Slicing.  A network slice is a virtual network that
       consists of a managed set of resources carved off from a larger
       network [I-D.geng-netslices-architecture].  Whatever technologies
       are used to support slicing, they will require a clear definition
       of the boundary of a given slice.

   While it is clearly desirable to use common solutions, and therefore
   common standards, wherever possible, it is increasingly difficult to
   do so while satisfying the widely varying requirements outlined
   above.  However, there is a tendency when new protocols and protocol
   extensions are proposed to always ask the question "How will this
   work across the open Internet?"  This document suggests that this is
   not always the right question.  There are protocols and extensions
   that are not intended to work across the open Internet.  On the
   contrary, their requirements and semantics are specifically limited
   (in the sense defined above).

   A common argument is that if a protocol is intended for limited use,
   the chances are very high that it will in fact be used (or misused)
   in other scenarios including the so-called open Internet.  This is
   undoubtedly true and means that limited use is not an excuse for bad
   design or poor security.  In fact, a limited use requirement
   potentially adds complexity to both the protocol and its security
   design, as discussed later.

   Nevertheless, because of the diversity of limited environments with
   specific requirements that is now emerging, specific standards will
   necessarily emerge.  There will be attempts to capture each market
   sector, but the market will demand standardised limited solutions.
   However, the "open Internet" must remain as the universal method of
   interconnection.  Reconciling these two aspects is a major challenge.

4.  Examples of Limited Domain Solutions

   This section lists various examples of specific limited domain
   solutions that have been proposed or defined.  It intentionally does
   not include Layer 2 technology solutions, which by definition apply
   to limited domains.

   NOTE: Please suggest additional items for this list.

Internet-Draft               Limited Domains              September 2018


   1.   Differentiated Services.  This mechanism [RFC2474] allows a
        network to assign locally significant values to the 6-bit
        Differentiated Services Code Point field in any IP packet.
        Although there are some recommended codepoint values for
        specific per-hop queue management behaviours, these are
        specifically intended to be domain-specific codepoints with
        traffic being classified, conditioned and re-marked at domain
        boundaries (unless there is an inter-domain agreement that makes
        re-marking unnecessary).

   2.   Network function virtualisation.  As described in
        [I-D.irtf-nfvrg-gaps-network-virtualization], this general
        concept is an open research topic, in which virtual network
        functions are orchestrated as part of a distributed system.
        Inevitably such orchestration applies to an administrative
        domain of some kind, even though cross-domain orchestration is
        also a research area.

   3.   Service Function Chaining (SFC).  This technique [RFC7665]
        assumes that services within a network are constructed as
        sequences of individual functions within a specific SFC-enabled
        domain.  As that RFC states: "Specific features may need to be
        enforced at the boundaries of an SFC-enabled domain, for example
        to avoid leaking SFC information".  A Network Service Header
        (NSH) [RFC8300] is used to encapsulate packets flowing through
        the service function chain: "The intended scope of the NSH is
        for use within a single provider's operational domain."

   4.   Data Centre Network Virtualization Overlays.  A common
        requirement in data centres that host many tenants (clients) is
        to provide each one with a secure private network, all running
        over the same physical infrastructure.  [RFC8151] describes
        various use cases for this, and specifications are under
        development.  These include use cases in which the tenant
        network is physically split over several data centres, but which
        must appear to the user as a single secure domain.

   5.   Segment Routing.  This is a technique which "steers a packet
        through an ordered list of instructions, called segments"
        [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing].  The semantics of these
        instructions are explicitly local to a segment routing domain or
        even to a single node.  Technically, these segments or
        instructions are represented as an MPLS label or an IPv6
        address, which clearly adds a semantic interpretation to them
        within the domain.

   6.   Autonomic Networking.  As explained in
        [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model], an autonomic network is also a



Carpenter & Liu          Expires March 16, 2019                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               Limited Domains              September 2018


        security domain within which an autonomic control plane
        [I-D.ietf-anima-autonomic-control-plane] is used by service
        agents.  These service agents manage technical objectives, which
        may be locally defined, subject to domain-wide policy.  Thus the
        domain boundary is important for both security and protocol
        purposes.

   7.   Homenet.  As shown in [RFC7368], a home networking domain has
        specific protocol needs that differ from those in an enterprise
        network or the Internet as a whole.  These include the Home
        Network Control Protocol (HNCP) [RFC7788] and a naming and
        discovery solution [I-D.ietf-homenet-simple-naming].

   8.   Creative uses of IPv6 features.  As IPv6 enters more general
        use, engineers notice that it has much more flexibility than
        IPv4.  Innovative suggestions have been made for:

        *  The flow label, e.g.  [RFC6294],
           [I-D.fioccola-v6ops-ipv6-alt-mark].

        *  Extension headers, e.g. for segment routing
           [I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].

        *  Meaningful address bits, e.g.  [I-D.jiang-semantic-prefix].
           Also, segment routing uses IPv6 addresses as segment
           identifiers with specific local meanings
           [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing].

        All of these suggestions are only viable within a specified
        domain.  The case of the extension header is particularly
        interesting, since its existence has been a major "selling
        point" for IPv6, but it is notorious that new extension headers
        are virtually impossible to deploy across the whole Internet
        [RFC7045], [RFC7872].  It is worth noting that extension header
        filtering is considered as an important security issue
        [I-D.ietf-opsec-ipv6-eh-filtering].  There is considerable
        appetite among vendors or operators to have flexibility in
        defining extension headers for use in limited or specialised
        domains, e.g.  [I-D.voyer-6man-extension-header-insertion] and
        [BIGIP].

   9.   Deterministic Networking (DetNet).  The Deterministic Networking
        Architecture [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture] and encapsulation
        [I-D.ietf-detnet-dp-sol] aim to support flows with extremely low
        data loss rates and bounded latency, but only within a part of
        the network that is "DetNet aware".  Thus, as for differentiated
        services above, the concept of a domain is fundamental.

Internet-Draft               Limited Domains              September 2018


   10.  Provisioning Domains (PvDs).  An architecture for Multiple
        Provisioning Domains has been defined [RFC7556] to allow hosts
        attached to multiple networks to learn explicit details about
        the services provided by each of those networks.

5.  Taxonomy of Limited Domains

   This section develops a taxonomy for describing limited domains.
   Several major aspects are considered in this taxonomy:

   o  The domain as a whole.

   o  The individual nodes.

   o  The domain boundary.

   o  The domain's topology.

   o  The domain's technology.

   o  How the domain connects to the Internet.

   o  The security, trust and privacy model.

   o  Operations.

   The following sub-sections analyse each of these aspects.

5.1.  The Domain as a Whole

   o  Why does the domain exist? (e.g., human choice, administrative
      policy, orchestration requirements, technical requirements)

   o  If there are special requirements, are they at Layer 2, Layer 3 or
      an upper layer?

   o  Is the domain managed by humans or fully autonomic?

   o  If managed, what style of management applies?  (Manual
      configuration, automated configuration, orchestration?)

   o  Is there a policy model?  (Intent, configuration policies?)

   o  Does the domain provide controlled or paid service or open access?

Internet-Draft               Limited Domains              September 2018


5.2.  Individual Nodes

   o  Is a domain member a complete node, or only one interface of a
      node?

   o  Are nodes permanent members of a given domain, or are join and
      leave operations possible?

   o  Are nodes physical or virtual devices?

   o  Are virtual nodes general-purpose, or limited to specific
      functions, applications or users?

   o  Are nodes constrained (by battery etc)?

   o  Are devices installed "out of the box" or pre-configured?

5.3.  The Domain Boundary

   o  How is the domain boundary identified or defined?

   o  Is the domain boundary fixed or dynamic?

   o  Are boundary nodes special?  Or can any node be at the boundary?

5.4.  Topology

   o  Is the domain a subset of a layer 2 or 3 connectivity domain?

   o  In IP addressing terms, is the domain Link-local, Site-local, or
      Global?

   o  Does the domain overlap other domains?  (In other words, a node
      may or may not be allowed to be a member of multiple domains.)

   o  Does the domain match physical topology, or does it have a virtual
      (overlay) topology?

   o  Is the domain in a single building, vehicle or campus?  Or is it
      distributed?

   o  If distributed, are the interconnections private or over the
      Internet?

   o  In IP addressing terms, is the domain Link-local, Site-local, or
      Global?

   o  In routing terms, what routing protocol(s) are used, or even
      different forwarding mechanisms (MPLS or other non-IP mechanism)?

   o  In an overlay domain, what overlay technique is used (L2VPN,
      L3VPN,...)?

   o  Are there specific QoS requirements?

   o  Link latency - normal or long latency links?

   o  Mobility - are nodes mobile?  Is the whole network mobile?

   o  Which specific technologies, such as those in Section 4, are
      applicable?

5.6.  Connection to the Internet

   o  Is the Internet connection permanent or intermittent?  (Never
      connected is out of scope.)

   o  What traffic is blocked, in and out?

   o  What traffic is allowed, in and out?

   o  What traffic is transformed, in and out?

   o  Is secure and privileged remote access needed?

   o  Does the domain allow unprivileged remote sessions?

5.7.  Security, Trust and Privacy Model

   o  Must domain members be authorized?

   o  Are all nodes in the domain at the same trust level?

   o  Is traffic authenticated?

   o  Is traffic encrypted?

   o  What is hidden from the outside?

5.8.  Operations

   o  Safety level - does the domain have a critical (human) safety
      role?

   o  Reliability requirement - normal or 99.999% ?

   o  Environment - hazardous conditions?

   o  Installation - are specialists needed?

   o  Service visits - easy, difficult, impossible?

   o  Software/firmware updates - possible or impossible?

6.  Common Features of Limited Domains

   As the preceding taxonomy shows, there are very numerous aspects to a
   domain, so the common features are not immediately obvious.  It would
   be possible, but tedious, to apply the taxonomy to each of the domain
   types described in Section 3.  However, we can observe some recurrent
   features without doing so:

   1.  It must be possible to define the domain boundary.

   2.  It must be possible for domain members to determine whether a
       particular node is in the the domain.

   3.  It must be possible for a node to determine which domain(s) it is
       in.

   4.  It must be possible for a node to find boundary nodes
       (interfacing to the Internet).

   5.  In a domain with security requirements, it must be possible for a
       node to present and acquire security credentials.

   6.  In a domain with management requirements, it must be possible for
       a node to acquire domain policy and/or domain configuration data.

   7.  In a domain with dynamic membership, join and leave operations
       must be possible.

   More TBD

7.  Defining a Limited Domain Boundary

   This section justifies the need for a precise definition of a limited
   domain boundary and for a corresponding protocol to allow nodes to
   discover where such a boundary exists.

   More TBD

8.  Defining Protocol Scope

   This section suggests that protocols or protocol extensions should,
   when appropriate, be standardised to interoperate only within a
   Limited Domain Boundary.  Such protocols are not required to operate
   across the Internet as a whole.

   Point noted in discussion: "Operate" is a weaker statement than
   "interoperate".  A question to be addressed is whether a limited-
   domain protocol is allowed to have local variants, such that
   implementations in different domains could not interoperate if those
   domains were unified by some mechanism.

   More TBD

9.  Security Considerations

   Clearly, the boundary of a limited domain will almost always also act
   as a security boundary.  In particular, it will serve as a trust
   boundary, and as a boundary of authority for defining capabilities.
   Within the boundary, limited-domain protocols or protocol features
   will be useful, but they will be meaningless if they enter or leave
   the domain.

   The security model for a limited-scope protocol must allow for the
   boundary, and in particular for a trust model that changes at the
   boundary.  Typically, credentials will need to be signed by a domain-
   specific authority.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of the IANA.
