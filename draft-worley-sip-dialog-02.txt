Abstract

   This document sets out guidelines for how user agents should
   implement the dialog event package in order to be usable in systems
   that implement end-point controlled call-control (EPCC) features.
   The guidelines are in addition to the basic requirements for dialog
   event package implementation in RFC 3265 and RFC 4235.  Five current
   commercial implementations are compared with the guidelines.

Internet-Draft   Guidelines for the Dialog Event Package       June 2006


1.  Background

   SIP implements telephony and similar applications over the Internet.
   SIP largely conforms to the "end-to-end principle"[3], putting the
   major responsibility for "call-control features" on the user agents
   (telephones) themselves, in contrast to traditional telephony, where
   the intelligence is concentrated in a small number of centralized
   switches.  This scheme for implementing call-control features is
   called EPCC, end-point controlled call control.  In order for a user
   agent to interact with dialogs (calls) that are present on other user
   agents, those user agents must publish the state of the dialogs in
   which they are participating in a dialog event package[1][2].  A user
   agent can retrieve another user agent's dialog event package to
   obtain the identifiers of the second user agent's dialogs, and using
   those identifiers, it can manipulate those dialogs.

   Unfortunately, the dialog event package was specified before the
   breadth of its importance was fully understood, so its specification
   is relatively loose.  Loose enough that many implementations
   conforming to the standard are not usable for end-point call control
   (EPCC).  It is the purpose of this document to provide a
   specification of the dialog event package that is tight enough to
   ensure that a user agent can fully participate in current and future
   EPCC operations.

   This document is not intended to advance toward standardization.
   However, if it proves valuable to implementors, it may evolve into a
   statement of best common practice.

Internet-Draft   Guidelines for the Dialog Event Package       June 2006


2.  Guidelines

   This section contains the guidelines for implementing high-quality
   dialog event packages, and a discussion of the motivation for each
   guideline.

2.1.  Addressing

   A potential subscriber to the dialog event package will often know
   only an AOR (address of record) to identify the UA with which it
   desires to communicate, so the subscriber will have to route its
   SUBSCRIBE through a proxy for the AOR.  The proxy will route the
   SUBSCRIBE to the registered contact URIs for that AOR.

   Alternatively, a potential subscriber may know of a contact URI that
   the UA has used within a transaction or dialog.  Contact URIs may
   route directly to the UA.

   Guideline 1: A UA should accept SUBSCRIBEs to all URIs that it uses
                as contacts for AORs, and all URIs that it uses as
                contacts in transactions or dialogs.

   A single UA may have contacts for multiple AORs, some of which may
   have contacts at other UAs.  So dialog events "for an AOR" should
   only contain information about dialogs that were somehow addressed to
   that AOR.

   Guideline 2: A SUBSCRIBE to a URI that the UA uses as a contact for
                an AOR should obtain dialog events that describe only
                INVITEs "for the AOR" that corresponds to that URI.

   Guideline 3: A SUBSCRIBE to a URI that the UA uses as a contact for a
                dialog or transaction should obtain dialog events that
                describe only INVITEs "for the AOR" that corresponds to
                that URI.

2.2.  Status/Presence

   Attendant consoles and other status reporting devices sometimes want
   information about the status of a UA as a whole (and thus implicitly
   its user's status), rather than about all dialogs that were addressed
   to a particular AOR.  It would be desirable if there was a way to
   subscribe to events for all dialogs on a UA, but there seems to be no
   way for the UA to disseminate such a URI, and no standardized way to
   construct one.  Perhaps a parameter on the request URI, or a
   parameter on the event package name in the Event header, could be
   used to indicate a desire for information for the entire UA.

Internet-Draft   Guidelines for the Dialog Event Package       June 2006


   The concept of such a subscription raises the question of "What are
   all the URIs for a UA?", since the UA may not be a discrete physical
   object.  The concept of to "URIs being lines on the same UA" doesn't
   seem to be intrinsic to SIP.  Perhaps the set of contact URIs that
   share a +sip.instance value should be considered to comprise "a UA".

2.3.  Dialog Package Data

   RFC 4235 [1] does not define what is to be considered the "resource"
   that is the subject of a dialog event subscription, and thus, what is
   to be the value of the entity attribute of the dialog-info element.
   But the examples in [1] make its intended use clear:

   Guideline 4: The entity attribute of the dialog-info element should
                contain the AOR corresponding to the contact URI that
                was the request-URI of the SUBSCRIBE establishing the
                subscription.

   In order to implement EPCC, the dialog event package needs to contain
   each dialog's identifiers.  In addition, in order to be able to
   select the dialog that has been ringing the longest out of a set of
   early dialogs, the dialog event package needs to contain the duration
   element.  (The state element is mandatory per [1].)

   Guideline 5: The dialog event package should include the call-id,
                local-tag, remote-tag, and direction attributes of the
                dialog element.  It should include the duration and
                state sub-elements of the dialog element.

   In order to allow a variety of EPCC functions, the data in the dialog
   event package needs to comprehensively describe the dialog's
   endpoints in a standard way.  The examples in [1] show the intended
   usage:

   Guideline 6: The dialog event package should use the following
                sources for the following elements:

                The local and remote elements are to report the
                initiator's or recipient's information, as determined by
                the direction attribute.

                initiator's identity: the "From" header of the original
                INVITE

                initiator's target: the "Contact" header of the original
                INVITE, as updated by any UPDATE or re-INVITE

                recipient's identity: the "From" header that would be

                used when initiating a call from the AOR corresponding
                to the request-URI as seen by the recipient, or
                alternatively, the "To" header of the original INVITE

                recipient's target: the "Contact" header of the original
                2xx response to the INVITE, as updated by any UPDATE or
                re-INVITE

   Note that both Contact headers can be updated by re-INVITE and UPDATE
   requests during the dialog:

   Guideline 7: The local and remote target elements in the dialog event
                package should be updated when the contacts of the
                endpoints change.

3.  Security Considerations

   Privacy and security considerations suggest that different components
   of the dialog package should be accessible to different subscribers.
   At a minimum, three levels of access can be distinguished: all dialog
   information, busy/not-busy information, and no information.  Further
   work is needed to determine appropriate levels of access and how to
   restrict each level of access to the appropriate subscribers.

3.1.  Access to All Information

   Because an agent that knows a dialog's parameters has total control
   over the dialog, dissemination of the parameters should be restricted
   to trusted agents.  (E.g., imagine the Jerky Boys subscribing to
   dialog events for your organization's customer service line.)

   Guideline 8: A UA should have a way of restricting dialog information
                to trusted subscribers.  A UA should provide one of the
                following methods to determine which subscribers are
                trusted:

                A.  only SUBSCRIBEs coming directly from specified IP
                    address(es) are trusted (which delegates security
                    decisions to the SIP agent(s) at those address(es)),
                    or

                B.  only SUBSCRIBEs authorized by appropriate keys are
                    trusted (which requires a keying infrastructure).

   Guideline 9: If method A is used, an additional mechanism may be
                needed for the SIP agent(s) which make the security
                decisions to communicate to the UA the level of
                disclosure to be made by the subscription.

3.2.  Access to Busy/Not-busy Information

   Untrusted SUBSCRIBEs may come from any place on the Internet.
   Because the dialog event package provides presence information even
   if the dialog identifiers are removed, and presence information has
   privacy implications:

   Guideline 10: A UA should provide even edited versions of the dialog
                 event package only to subscribers which pass a
                 security/privacy policy, and not indiscriminately.

4.  Current Implementations

   This section compares the dialog event packages produced by five
   commercial implementations against the list of 9 recommended data
   items in the guidelines.  The data in this section is summarized from
   user agent interactions with the interop.pingtel.com interoperability
   test server over the period 21 Jan 2006 to 18 May 2006.  In each
   case, the version of the product is the latest available in the data
   set.

             | Datum / Product          | A | B | C | D | E |

             | Local-tag present        | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y |
             |                          |   |   |   |   |   |
             | Remote-tag present       | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y |
             |                          |   |   |   |   |   |
             | Direction present        | Y | Y | Y | Y | Y |
             |                          |   |   |   |   |   |
             | Duration present         | - | - | - | Y | - |
             |                          |   |   |   |   |   |
             | Local identity is AOR    | Y | - | Y | Y | Y |
             |                          |   |   |   |   |   |
             | Local target is contact  | Y | * | Y | Y | ! |
             |                          |   |   |   |   |   |
             | Remote identity is AOR   | Y | * | Y | Y | Y |
             |                          |   |   |   |   |   |
             | Remote target is contact | - | - | Y | - | Y |
             +--------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+

   Key: "Y" = datum present. "-" = datum absent. "*" = datum present,
   but not with the recommended value. "!" = datum present, but value is
   unusable, and would be better omitted.

   Comparison of this data with data taken at SIPit 17 (September 2005)
   shows some improvement, but given that the dialog event package was
   stabilized before April 2005, progress has been depressingly slow.
