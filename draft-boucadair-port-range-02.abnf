          2.1.  In addition to the information retrieved to enforce port
          range routing, retrieve the source IP address and packet
          identifier.  A fragmentation entry is instantiated.  A timer
          (referred to as fragmentation timer) is associated with this
          entry.  A clean up procedure is achieved when the timer
          expires.

          2.2.  Retrieve the binding entry to be used to route this
          first fragment.  A pointer to this entry is added to the
          fragmentation entry.  A fragmentation entry includes:
          destination IP address, source IP address, Identifier, binding
          entry identifier and timer.
