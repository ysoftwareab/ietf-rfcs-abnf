FULL_UPDATE_RATE = 60
           - How often routing messages containing complete routing
             tables are sent.

TRIGGERED_UPDATE_RATE = 5
           - How often triggered routing messages may be sent out.

QUERY_RATE = 120
           - How often local group membership is queried.

MEMBERSHIP_TIMEOUT = 2 * QUERY_RATE + 20
           - How long a local group membership is valid without
             confirmation.

LEAF_TIMEOUT = 2 * FULL_UPDATE_RATE + 5
           - How long the hold down timer is for a virtual interface.

NEIGHBOR_TIMEOUT = 4 * FULL_UPDATE_RATE
           - How long a neighbor is considered up without confirmation.
             This is important for timing out routes, and for setting
             the children and leaf flags.

EXPIRATION_TIMEOUT = 2 * FULL_UPDATE_RATE
           - How long a route is considered valid without confirmation.
             When this timeout expires, packets will no longer be
             forwarded on the route, and routing updates will consider
             this route to have a metric of infinity.

GARBAGE_TIMEOUT = 4 * FULL_UPDATE_RATE
           - How long a route exists without confirmation.  When this
             timeout expires, routing updates will no longer contain any
             information on this route, and the route will be deleted.
