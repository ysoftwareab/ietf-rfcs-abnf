 Urban Air Mobility Implications for Intelligent Transportation Systems
                    draft-templin-ipwave-uam-its-02

Abstract

   Urban Air Mobility concerns the introduction of manned and unmanned
   aircraft within urban environments, while Intelligent Transportation
   Systems have traditionally considered only terrestrial vehicles
   operating on city streets and highways.  This document considers the
   implications for introduction of low-altitude aircraft within urban
   environments operating in harmony with ground transportation.

1.  Introduction

   Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concerns the introduction of manned and
   unmanned aircraft within urban environments.  Autonomy will play a
   pivotal role in the acceptance of low-altitude operations for aerial
   vehicles operating in harmony with traditional ground transportation
   and pedestrian traffic.  The UAM vision therefore builds on evolving
   works on Unmanned Air Systems (UAS), including the NASA UAS Traffic
   Management (UTM) service model [UTM].

   Use cases for autonomous aircraft in the UAM vision are endless, and
   include personal air vehicles, flying taxis, parcel delivery, law
   enforcement and countless others.  Major industry leaders such as
   Airbus [AIRBUS] and Boeing [BOEING] have accordingly begun to
   articulate their UAM strategies.  Programs such as Uber Elevate
   [UBER] anticipate deployment as early as within the next 2-5 years.

   With the advent of the UAM vision and its related initiatives,
   questions arise as to how the new model will be harmonized with the
   existing terrestrial mobility environment.  Directions for
   modernizing terrestrial mobility are emerging in programs such as the
   US Department of Transportation's Intelligent Transportation Systems
   [ITS] and anticipate an increasing role for Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V)
   and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communications.  The IETF
   recognizes this need and has formed the IP Wireless Access in
   Vehicular Environments (IPWAVE) working group with charter to produce
   a document that will specify the mechanisms for transmission of IPv6
   datagrams [RFC8200] over dedicated short-range wireless
   communications media.

   This document anticipates a need to provide a unified V2V and V2I
   service for all urban mobility agents, including both terrestrial and
   airborne.  Urban air vehicles will employ Vertical Takeoff And
   Landing (VTOL) and will operate at altitudes below 400 feet, such
   that coordinations with terrestrial vehicles will be inevitable and
   commonplace.  This work therefore proposes that urban air vehicles
   also employ a short-range V2V / V2I communications capability using
   the same types of wireless networking gear used in the terrestrial
   domain (e.g., DSRC, C-V2X, etc.).

   The urban mobility landscape is evolving from a two dimensional to a
   three dimensional environment.  Vehicles both on the ground and in
   the air will therefore need to coordinate with one another on a V2V
   and V2I basis even when supporting communications infrastructure such
   as cell towers are unavailable or otherwise too congested to support
   realtime exchanges.  The ipwave working group is therefore advised to
   consider the rapidly emerging and inevitable Urban Air Mobility
   future.

2.  Terminology

   Terms such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Urban Air
   Mobility (UAM), Unmanned Air Systems (UAS), UAS Traffic Management
   (UTM) and many others apply to the emerging urban mobility landscape.
   IETF keywords per [RFC2119] are not applicable within the scope of
   this document.

3.  Applicability

   Urban Air Mobility and Intelligent Transportation System concepts
   apply within all major urban areas worldwide.

4.  The Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) Interface

   UAM end systems will often have multiple data link connections,
   including cellular, SATCOM, short-range omni-directional, etc.  In
   order to provide mobility and multilink services, UAM end systems can
   employ an Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) interface
   [I-D.templin-6man-omni-interface] as a virtual Non-Broadcast Multiple
   Access (NBMA) connection to the serving ground domain network over
   the underlying data links.

   The OMNI interface and link model provide a nexus for multilink and
   mobility coordination using standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)
   messaging [RFC4861] according to the NBMA principle.  This supports
   the necessary mobility services with no need for adjunct mobility
   messaging, nor modifications to the IPv6 ND messaging services or
   link model.

5.  Implementation Status

   Early prototyping and testing are underway.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no IANA considerations.

7.  Security Considerations

   Communications networking security is necessary to preserve the

   coordinations.
