Abstract

   The L2TP working draft describes a protocol which permits the
   tunnelling of the link layer of PPP. This document augments the
   procedures described in the L2TP working draft to support ATM SVC or
   PVC based access networks. The necessary extensions to the L2TP
   working draft are defined in order to allow for non-HDLC based
   framing (and related link options negotiation according to "PPP over
   AAL5" as defined in [3]) and asymmetric bi-directional call
   establishment in the access network.

1. Introduction

   L2TP as described in [1] is a tunnelling protocol that allows
   tunnelling of PPP sessions between a LAC and LNS (see [1] for these
   definitions). Currently it has been defined to support HDLC based
   ISDN/PSTN access networks.

   This document augments the procedures described in [1] to support ATM
   SVC or PVC based access networks. The necessary extensions to [1] are
   defined in order to allow for non-HDLC based framing (and related
   link options negotiation such as with procedures described in PPP
   over ATM [3]) and asymmetric bi-directional call establishment in the
   access network.

1.1 Conventions

   Throughout this document, the words that are used to define the
   significance of particular requirements are capitalised.  These words
   are:

   o "MUST"

   This word or the adjective "REQUIRED" means that the item is an
   absolute requirement of this specification.

   o "MUST NOT"

   This phrase means that the item is an absolute prohibition of this
   specification.

   o "SHOULD"

   This word or the adjective "RECOMMENDED" means that there may exist
   valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore this item, but
   the full implications should be understood and the case carefully
   weighed before choosing a different course.

   o "SHOULD NOT"

   This phrase means that there may exist valid reasons in particular
   circumstances when the listed behaviour is acceptable or even useful,
   but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully
   weighed before implementing any behaviour described with this label.

   o "MAY"

   This word or the adjective "OPTIONAL" means that this item is truly
   optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a
   particular marketplace requires it or because it enhances the
   product, for example; another vendor may omit the same item.

2. Assumptions

   In this section we describe some assumptions that have lead to the
   extensions described in this draft.

2.1 Topology

   The procedures as defined in [1] apply solely to access network
   technology such as PSTN and ISDN, which may be respectively asynch.
   HDLC and synch HDLC based. The aim of this document is to extend L2TP
   support to allow for user to LAC communication based on ATM access
   network technology which is inherently non-HDLC based. See also [3].

2.2 Connection Establishment

   Due to the wide variety of existing signalling protocols and ATM
   service categories, the signalling protocol specific information
   elements are not negotiated during call establishment over the L2TP
   tunnel.

3. ATM access enhanced procedures

   When comparing HDLC based access network support to non-HDLC based
   access network support, differences can be seen in the encapsulation
   of the PPP packets, and the allowance of negotiation of certain LCP
   features between client and LNS. These differences are translated in
   protocol operation changes.

Internet Draft   draft-tjoens-pppext-l2tp-atmext-01.txt      August 1998


   In order to illustrate the procedures specified within this draft,
   this section will provide a description of what might happen when a
   Virtual dial-up client initiates access through a (switched) ATM
   access network. Note that the emphasis is on the changes proposed
   within this draft relative to [1].

3.1 ATM connectivity

   Prior to initiating the PPP protocol layer, a Virtual Connection (VC)
   MUST be established between the user and the Network Access Server
   (LAC). This virtual connection MAY either be a preconfigured
   Permanent VC(PVC), where the access network provider, NAS and user
   agree beforehand on the characteristics of the PVC, or MAY be an on-
   demand switched VC(SVC), where the negotiation between user, network
   and NAS takes place by means of an ATM signalling protocol.

   In both cases, the user is referred to as the Virtual dial-in user.

   Prior to accepting the switched connection from the Virtual dial-in
   user, the LAC MAY check with the LNS whether the call should be
   accepted. In the latter situation, the LAC MAY determine based upon
   parameters available within the call establishment message that this
   concerns a virtual dial in user, or MAY undertake a partial
   authentication of the end system/user, in order to bind the end
   system/user with a specific LNS.

3.2 Tunnel establishment

   If no tunnel connection currently exists to the desired LNS, one is
   initiated. During the tunnel establishment, LNS and LAC indicate
   bearer and framing capabilities to each other, according to normal
   procedures. The AVPs that cover these capabilities are however
   extended.

   The bearer capability is extended to allow the identification of ATM
   devices in the LAC. This allows the LNS to use the extensions as
   defined within this draft to support ATM based outgoing calls.

   The framing capability is extended to allow the identification of PPP
   session transport over AAL5 between user and LAC (not based on HDLC-
   like framing). This allows the LNS to negotiate link options
   according to "PPP over AAL5" as defined in [3].

   If no compatibility between LNS and LAC exists according to the
   extensions defined within this draft, no tunnel establishment can
   take place. This would be because the LAC does not support any bearer
   capability which is expected by the LNS, or vice versa. It is however
   encouraged that LAC or LNS implementations would allow for seamless

Internet Draft   draft-tjoens-pppext-l2tp-atmext-01.txt      August 1998


   interworking with peer devices which do not implement the extensions
   defined within this draft.


3.3 call establishment

   During incoming and outgoing broadband call establishment, the
   following extensions are defined to existing procedures.

   During OCRQ, the LNS MUST indicate to the LAC minimum and maximum
   speeds for receive and transmit traffic (from the LAC perspective).
   This is to allow for the bi-directional asymmetric nature of ATM
   traffic contracts. Note that in order to support UBR connections
   between LAC and user, the Minimum BPS MUST be set to zero.

   Further the LNS MUST indicate to the LAC in OCRQ message the dialed
   number according to the format described in this draft.

3.4 Framing

   Within this document the PPP PDU refers to the concatenation of PPP
   protocol ID, PPP Information and PPP padding fields.

   In the direction of user to LNS, the PPP PDU will be carried on top
   of an AAL5 connection between user and LAC. The LAC MUST strip off
   the AAL5 specific fields based on the encapsulation mechanism in use
   on the ATM connection, i.e. VC multiplexed or LLC encapsulated [3].

   In the direction of LNS to user, the PPP PDU will be carried on top
   of an AAL5 connection between LAC and user. The LAC MUST insert the
   AAL5 specific fields based on the encapsulation mechanism in use on
   the ATM connection, i.e. VC multiplexed or LLC encapsulated [3].

4. Service model issues

4.1 Authentication

   In case of ATM switched VC establishment, calling party number
   information may be used for first level authentication much in the
   same way as for PSTN or ISDN access. In case of permanent VC
   establishment, authentication may not be an issue from the LAC side,
   because of the permanent character of the VC. Bilateral agreement
   between LAC and LNS providers may eliminate the authentication phase
   in the latter case.

4.2 Authorization

   Because of the flexibility of establishing ATM connections with

Internet Draft   draft-tjoens-pppext-l2tp-atmext-01.txt      August 1998


   varying parameters, some authorization may be required prior to
   accepting the establishment of an ATM connection from the user with
   certain ATM traffic parameters. This authorization may be performed
   against the ATM specific authentication information (e.g. calling
   line id), or may be performed after partial authentication of the
   user at the PPP level. Non authorized access requests result in
   connection release.

5. New and extended AVPs

   The Vendor ID field SHOULD be set to the Alcatel vendor ID. (note
   here that adoption of this I-d as an RFC would lead to the IETF
   supported vendor id which equals zero.)

5.1 New AVP Summary

   The following table lists the extra AVPs that are defined within this
   document. The "attr" column indicates the integer value assigned to
   this attribute.  Note that the attribute value is relative compared
   to the vendor ID. The "M" column indicates the setting of the
   "Mandatory" bit of the AVP header for each attribute. The "LEN"
   column indicates the size of the AVP including the AVP header. A "+"
   in this column indicates that the length varies depending upon the
   length of the actual contents of the value field.

   The usage list for each entry indicates the message types that
   utilize each AVP. An abbreviation shown in mixed or upper case
   letters indicates that the corresponding AVP MUST be present in this
   message type. All lower case indicates that the AVP MAY optionally
   appear in this message type. Some AVPs MAY be present only when a
   corresponding optional AVP or specific setting within the AVP is
   present, these AVPs are shown in lower case as well.

   Attr    M       Len     Attribute Name (usage)

   1       0       32      Rx Minimum BPS (OCRQ)
      32-bit integer indicating the lowest acceptable line speed for the
      call in the receive direction.  Rx indicates the user to LAC
      direction.
   2       0       32      Rx Maximum BPS (OCRQ)
      32-bit integer indicating the highest acceptable line speed for
      call in the receive direction.  Rx indicates the user to LAC
      direction.
   3       0       9+      ATM Cause Code (cdn)
      16-bit cause code, 1 octet cause message, and optional ASCII
      advisory message.

      The following lists the new AVPs defined within this draft, and
      describes the expected behaviour when this AVP would be present
      within a message.

        The Rx Minimum BPS AVP encodes the lowest acceptable line speed
        for this call in the receive direction, for these cases where
        asymmetric transmission is required. This AVP MAY be included
        within the OCRQ, and SHOULD only be included when the LAC
        indicated ATM support in the bearer capabilities AVP during
        tunnel establishment.

        The Rx Maximum BPS AVP encodes the highest acceptable line speed
        for this call in the receive direction, for these cases where
        asymmetric transmission is required. This AVP MAY be included
        within the OCRQ, and SHOULD only be included when the LAC
        indicated ATM support in the bearer capabilities AVP during
        tunnel establishment.

5.3 Changed AVP Definition

   The following AVPs see their contents changed relative to [1] in
   order to support ATM access awareness.

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


        The framing Capabilities AVP within a SCCRQ or SCCRP indicates
        the type of framing that the sender of this message can provide.
        If bit A is set, asynchronous framing is supported. If bit S is
        set, synchronous framing is supported.

        If bit N is set, this indicates that LNS and LAC implement the
        extensions described in this document, particularly the PPP on
        the LNS supports link options negotiation for LCP phase
        according to "PPP over AAL5" as described in [3].

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


        The bearer Capabilities AVP within a SCCRQ or SCCRP indicates
        the bearer capabilities that the sender of this message can
        provide for outgoing calls. If bit B is set, broadband access is
        supported (ATM), if bit A is set, analogue access is supported.
        If bit D is set, Digital access is supported.

        This AVP provides the peer with an indication of the bearer
        device types supported by the hardware interfaces of the sender
        for outgoing calls. An LNS SHOULD NOT initiate an outgoing call
        specifying a value in the Bearer Type AVP for a device type not
        advertised in the Bearer Capabilities AVP it received from the
        LAC during control connection establishment. Attempts to do so
        will result in the call being rejected.

        In these cases where the LAC only supports the B bit, and the
        LNS would not recognize the B bit, no outgoing calls are
        possible. Note that when the LAC only has ATM based devices, it
        may still opt for fall back to digital bearer types.

   (Tx) Minimum BPS

        The (Tx) Minimum BPS AVP encodes the lowest acceptable line
        speed for this call in the transmit direction. The (Tx) Minimum
        BPS AVP MAY be used in OCRQ. If the Rx Minimum BPS is not
        available in the message, then symmetric transmission is
        implied, with both minimum receive and transmit bit-rates equal
        to Minimum BPS.

        (Tx) Minimum BPS is set in bits/second, and may be mapped to the
        PCR in cells/second for ATM based traffic. Note that the PCR is
        a mandatory parameter for all service capabilities in ATM
        signalling. The exact mapping to signalling IEs is outside the
        scope of this draft.

   (Tx) Maximum BPS

        (Tx) Maximum BPS AVP encodes the highest acceptable line speed

        for this call in the transmit direction. The (Tx) Maximum BPS
        AVP MAY be used in OCRQ. If the Rx Maximum BPS AVP is not
        available in the message, then symmetric transmission is
        implied, with both maximum receive and transmit bitrates equal
        to Maximum BPS.

        (Tx) Maximum BPS is set in bits/second, and may be mapped to the
        PCR in cells/second for ATM based traffic. Note that the PCR is
        a mandatory parameter for all service capabilities in ATM
        signalling. The exact mapping to signalling IEs is outside the
        scope of this draft.

        The bearer type AVP encodes the bearer type for the requested
        call. The bearer type AVP MUST be present in the OCRQ, and MAY
        be present in the ICRQ. If bit B is set, broadband access is
        requested (ATM), if bit A is set, analogue access is requested.
        If bit D is set, Digital access is requested.

        Note that in the OCRQ all 3 bits (B,A,D) may be set indicating
        that the call may be of either type. The B bit SHOULD only be
        set if the Broadband capability was indicated during tunnel
        establishment.

        If ONLY the B bit is set in the Bearer Type AVP in the OCRQ
        message, the LNS MUST proceed LCP negotiation with the user
        according to the procedures concerning LCP options negotiation
        identified in [3] for PPP over AAL5.

        The framing type AVP encodes the framing type for the requested
        call. If bit A is set, asynchronous framing is requested. If bit
        S is set, synchronous framing is requested.

        If bit N is set, this indicates that LNS implement the
        extensions described in this document, particularly the PPP on
        the LNS supports link options negotiation for LCP phase
        according to "PPP over AAL5" as described in [3].  The N bit
        should only be set if tunnel negotiation indicated its support
        by the LAC.

        The framing type MAY be used as an indication to PPP on the LNS
        as to what link options to use for LCP phase (refer to "PPP over
        AAL5" [3]).

        The Dialed Number AVP indicates the number that should be used
        to address the virtual dial in user. The Dialed number AVP MUST
        be present in OCRQ, and MAY be present in ICRQ. The Dialed
        number AVP SHOULD be interpreted as binary encoded when the B
        bit is set in the Bearer Type AVP. The NSAP binary encoded
        address provides a broader range of address encapsulation
        methods than an ASCII field. In the NSAP field, which MUST have
        the length of 20 octets, the addressing protocol used (E.164,
        ICD, DCC) is specified as defined in [4].
