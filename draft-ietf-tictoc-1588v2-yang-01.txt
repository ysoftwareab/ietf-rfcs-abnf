1. Introduction

   As a synchronization protocol, IEEE 1588-2008 (also known as IEEE
   1588v2) [IEEE1588] is widely supported in the carrier networks,
   industrial networks, automotive networks, and many other
   applications. It can provide high precision time synchronization as
   fine as nano-seconds. The protocol depends on a Precision Time
   Protocol (PTP) engine to decide its own state automatically, and a
   PTP transportation layer to carry the PTP timing and various
   quality messages. The configuration parameters and state data sets
   of IEEE 1588-2008 are numerous.

   According to the concepts described in [RFC3444], IEEE 1588-2008
   itself provides an information model in its normative

   specifications for the data sets (in IEEE 1588-2008 clause 8). Some
   standardization organizations including the IETF have specified
   data models in MIBs (Management Information Bases) for IEEE 1588-
   2008 data sets (e.g. [PTP-MIB], [IEEE8021AS]). These MIBs are
   typically focused on retrieval of state data using the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP), while configuration of PTP data
   sets is not considered.

   Some service providers and applications require that the management
   of the IEEE 1588-2008 synchronization network be flexible and more
   Internet-based (typically overlaid on their transport networks).
   Software Defined Network (SDN) is another driving factor, which
   demands an improved configuration capability of synchronization
   networks.

   YANG [RFC6020] is a data modeling language used to model
   configuration and state data manipulated by network management
   protocols like the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)
   [RFC6241]. A small set of built-in data types are defined in
   [RFC6020], and a collection of common data types are further
   defined in [RFC6991]. Advantages of YANG include Internet based
   configuration capability, validation, rollback and so on. All of
   these characteristics make it attractive to become another
   candidate modeling language for IEEE 1588-2008.

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020] data model for the
   configuration of IEEE 1588-2008 devices and clocks, and retrieval
   of the state data of IEEE 1588-2008 clocks. The data model is based
   on the PTP data sets as specified in [IEEE1588]. The technology
   specific IEEE 1588-2008 information, e.g., those specifically
   implemented by a bridge, a router or a telecom profile, is out of
   scope of this document.

   When used in practice, network products in support of
   synchronization typically conform to one or more IEEE 1588-2008
   profiles.  Each profile specifies how IEEE 1588-2008 is used in a
   given industry (e.g. telecom, automotive) and application.  A
   profile can require features that are optional in IEEE 1588-2008,
   and it can specify new features that use IEEE 1588-2008 as a
   foundation.

   It is expected that the IEEE 1588-2008 YANG module will be used as
   follows:

   o  The IEEE 1588-2008 YANG module can be used as-is for products
   that conform to one of the default profiles specified in IEEE 1588-
   2008.

Internet-Draft            1588v2 YANG Model              November 2016


   o  When the IEEE 1588 standard is revised (e.g. the IEEE 1588
   revision in progress scheduled to be published in 2017), it will
   add some new optional features to its data sets.  The YANG module
   of this document can be revised and extended to add the new
   features (e.g. of IEEE 1588-2017). The YANG "revision" can be used
   to indicate changes to the YANG module.

   o  A profile standard based on IEEE 1588-2008 may create a
   dedicated YANG module for its profile. The profile's YANG module
   may use YANG "import" to import the IEEE 1588-2008 YANG module as
   its foundation.  Then the profile's YANG module can use YANG
   "augment" to add any profile-specific enhancements.

   o  A product that conforms to a profile standard can also create
   its own YANG module. The product's YANG module can "import" the
   profile's module, and then use YANG "augment" to add any product-
   specific enhancements.

2. IEEE 1588-2008 YANG Model hierarchy

   This section describes the hierarchy of an IEEE 1588-2008 YANG
   module. Query and configuration of device wide or port specific
   configuration information and clock data set is described for this
   version.

   Query and configuration of clock information include:

   - Clock data set attributes in a clock node, including: current-ds,
   parent-ds, default-ds, time-properties-ds, and transparent-clock-
   default-ds.

   - Port-specific data set attributes, including: port-ds and
   transparent-clock-port-ds.

   The readers are assumed to be familiar with IEEE 1588-2008. As all
   PTP terminologies and PTP data set attributes are described in
   details in IEEE 1588-2008 [IEEE1588], this document only outlines
   each of them in the YANG module.

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is
   typically used by YANG modules as described in [REST-CONF]. This
   document uses the same representation and the meaning of the
   symbols in these diagrams is as follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
   data (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
   means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are
   also marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
   shown.

   o  Arrow ("->") stands for a reference to a particular leaf
   instance in the tree.

2.1. Interpretations from IEEE 1588 Working Group

   The preceding model and the associated YANG module have some subtle
   differences from the data set specifications of IEEE Std 1588-2008.
   These differences are based on interpretation from the IEEE 1588
   Working Group, and are intended to provide compatibility with
   future revisions of the IEEE 1588 standard.

   In IEEE Std 1588-2008, a physical product can implement multiple
   PTP clocks (i.e. ordinary, boundary, or transparent clock). As
   specified in 1588-2008 subclause 7.1, each of the multiple clocks
   operates in an independent domain. However, the organization of
   multiple PTP domains was not clear in the data sets of IEEE Std
   1588-2008. This document introduces the concept of PTP instance as
   described in the new revision of IEEE 1588. The instance concept is
   used exclusively to allow for optional support of multiple domains.
   The instance number has no usage within PTP messages.

   Based on statements in IEEE 1588-2008 subclauses 8.3.1. and 10.1,
   most transparent clock products have interpreted the transparent
   clock data sets to reside as a singleton at the root level of the
   managed product. Since 1588-2008 transparent clocks are domain
   independent, the instance concept is not applicable for domains.

4. Security Considerations

   YANG modules are designed to be accessed via the NETCONF protocol
   [RFC6241], thus security considerations in [RFC6241] apply here.
   Security measures such as using the NETCONF over SSH [RFC6242] and
   restricting its use with access control [RFC6536] can further
   improve its security, avoid injection attacks and misuse of the
   protocol.

   Some data nodes defined in this YANG module are writable, and any
   changes to them may adversely impact a synchronization network.

Appendix A  Transferring YANG Work to IEEE 1588 WG (Informational)

   This appendix describes a future plan to transition responsibility
   for IEEE 1588 YANG modules from the IETF TICTOC Working Group (WG)
   to the IEEE 1588 WG, which develops the time synchronization
   technology that the YANG modules are designed to manage.

   This appendix is forward-looking with regard to future
   standardization roadmaps in IETF and IEEE.  Since those roadmaps
   cannot be predicted with significant accuracy, this appendix is
   informational, and it does not specify imperatives or normative
   specifications of any kind.

   The IEEE 1588-2008 YANG module of this standard represents a
   cooperation between IETF (for YANG) and IEEE (for 1588).  For the
   initial standardization of IEEE-1588 YANG modules, the information
   model is relatively clear (i.e. IEEE 1588 data sets), but expertise
   in YANG is required, making IETF an appropriate location for the
   standards.  The TICTOC WG has expertise with IEEE 1588, making it
   the appropriate location within IETF.

   The IEEE 1588 WG anticipates future changes to its standard on an
   ongoing basis.  As IEEE 1588 WG members gain practical expertise
   with YANG, the IEEE 1588 WG will become more appropriate for
   standardization of its YANG modules.  As the IEEE 1588 standard is

   revised and/or amended, IEEE 1588 members can more effectively
   synchronize the revision of this YANG module with future versions
   of the IEEE 1588 standard.

   This appendix is meant to establish some clear expectations between
   IETF and IEEE about the future transfer of IEEE 1588 YANG modules
   to the IEEE 1588 WG.  The goal is to assist in making the future
   transfer as smooth as possible. As the transfer takes place, some
   case-by-case situations are likely to arise, which can be handled
   by discussion on the IETF TICTOC WG mailing lists and/or
   appropriate liaisons.

   This appendix obtained insight from [RFC4663], an informational
   memo that described a similar transfer of MIB work from the IETF
   Bridge MIB WG to the IEEE 802.1 WG.


A.1. Assumptions for the Transfer

   For the purposes of discussion in this appendix, assume that the
   IETF TICTOC WG has approved a standard YANG module for a published
   IEEE 1588 standard.  As of this writing, this is IEEE Std 1588-2008,
   but it is possible that YANG for subsequent 1588 revisions could be
   published from the IETF TICTOC WG.  For discussion in this appendix,
   we use the phrase "last IETF 1588 YANG" to refer to most recently
   published 1588 YANG from the IETF TICTOC WG.

   The IEEE-SA Standards Board New Standards Committee (NesCom)
   handles new Project Authorization Requests (PARs) (see
   http://standards.ieee.org/board/nes/). PARs are roughly the
   equivalent of IETF Working Group Charters and include information
   concerning the scope, purpose, and justification for
   standardization projects.

   Assume that IEEE 1588 has an approved PAR that explicitly specifies
   development of a YANG module. The transfer of YANG work will occur
   in the context of this IEEE 1588 PAR. For discussion in this
   appendix, we use the phrase "first IEEE 1588 YANG" to refer to the
   first IEEE 1588 standard for YANG.

   Assume that as part of the transfer of YANG work, the IETF TICTOC
   WG agrees to cease all work on standard YANG modules for IEEE 1588.

   Assume that the IEEE 1588 WG has participated in the development of
   the last IETF 1588 YANG module, such that the first IEEE 1588 YANG
   module will effectively be a revision of it. In other words, the
   transfer of YANG work will be relatively clean.

   The actual conditions for the future transfer can be such that the
   preceding assumptions do not hold. Exceptions to the assumptions
   will need to be addressed on a case-by-case basis at the time of
   the transfer. This appendix describes topics that can be addressed
   based on the preceding assumptions.

A.2. Intellectual Property Considerations

   During review of the legal issues associated with transferring
   Bridge MIB WG documents to the IEEE 802.1 WG (Section 3.1 and
   Section 9 of [RFC4663]), it was concluded that the IETF does not
   have sufficient legal authority to make the transfer to IEEE
   without the consent of the document authors.



   If the last IETF 1588 YANG is published as a RFC, the work is
   required to be transferred from the IETF to the IEEE, so that IEEE
   1588 WG can begin working on the first IEEE 1588 YANG.

   When work on the first IEEE YANG module begins in the IEEE 1588 WG,
   that work derives from the last IETF YANG module of this RFC,
   requiring a transfer of that work from the IETF to the IEEE. In
   order to avoid having the transfer of that work be dependent on the
   availability of this RFC's authors at the time of its publication,
   the IEEE Standards Association department of Risk Management and
   Licensing provided the appropriate forms and mechanisms for this
   document's authors to assign a non-exclusive license for IEEE to
   create derivative works from this document. Those IEEE forms and
   mechanisms will be updated as needed during the development of this
   document and any future IETF YANG modules for IEEE 1588. This will
   help to make the future transfer of work from IETF to IEEE occur as
   smoothly as possible.

   As stated in the initial "Status of this Memo", the YANG module in
   this document conforms to the provisions of BCP 78. The IETF will
   retain all the rights granted at the time of publication in the
   published RFCs.

A.3. Namespace and Module Name

   As specified in the "IANA Considerations" section, the YANG module
   in this document uses IETF as the root of its URN namespace and
   YANG module name.

   Use of IETF as the root of these names implies that the YANG module
   is standardized in a Working Group of IETF, using the IETF


Jiang, et al            Expires May 25, 2017                 [Page 25]

Internet-Draft            1588v2 YANG Model              November 2016


   processes. If the IEEE 1588 Working Group were to continue using
   these names rooted in IETF, the IEEE 1588 YANG standardization
   would need to continue in the IETF. The goal of transferring the
   YANG work is to avoid this sort of dependency between standards
   organizations.

   IEEE 802 has an active PAR (IEEE P802d) for creating a URN
   namespace for IEEE use (see
   http://standards.ieee.org/develop/project/802d.html). It is likely
   that this IEEE 802 PAR will be approved and published prior to the
   transfer of YANG work to the IEEE 1588 WG. If so, the IEEE 1588 WG
   can use the IEEE URN namespace for the first IEEE 1588 YANG module,
   such as:

      urn:ieee:Std:1588:yang:ieee1588-ptp-dataset

   where "ieee1588-ptp-dataset" is the registered YANG module name in
   the IEEE.

   Under the assumptions of section A.1, the first IEEE 1588 YANG
   module prefix can be the same as the last IETF 1588 YANG module
   prefix (i.e. "ptp-dataset"), since the nodes within both YANG
   modules are compatible.

   The result of these name changes are that for complete
   compatibility, a server (i.e. IEEE 1588 node) can choose to
   implement a YANG module for the last IETF 1588 YANG module (with
   IETF root) as well as the first IEEE 1588 YANG module (with IEEE
   root).  Since the content of the YANG module transferred are the
   same, the server implementation is effectively common for both.

   From a client's perspective, a client of the last IETF 1588 YANG
   module (or earlier) looks for the IETF-rooted module name; and a
   client of the first IEEE 1588 YANG module (or later) looks for the
   IEEE-rooted module name.

A.4. IEEE 1588 YANG Modules in ASCII Format

   Although IEEE 1588 can certainly decide to publish YANG modules
   only in the PDF format that they use for their standard documents,
   without publishing an ASCII version, most network management
   systems cannot import the YANG module directly from the PDF. Thus,
   not publishing an ASCII version of the YANG module would negatively
   impact implementers and deployers of YANG modules and would make
   potential IETF reviews of YANG modules more difficult.

Internet-Draft            1588v2 YANG Model              November 2016


   This appendix recommends that the IEEE 1588 WG consider future
   plans for:

   o Public availability of the ASCII YANG modules during project
      development. These ASCII files allow IETF participants to access
      these documents for pre-standard review purposes.

   o Public availability of the YANG portion of published IEEE 1588
      standards, provided as an ASCII file for each YANG module.
      These ASCII files are intended for use of the published IEEE
      1588 standard.

   As an example of public availability during project development,
   IEEE 802 uses the same repository that IETF uses for YANG module
   development (see https://github.com/YangModels/yang). IEEE branches
   are provided for experimental work (i.e. pre-PAR) as well as
   standard work (post-PAR drafts). IEEE-SA has approved use of this
   repository for project development, but not for published standards.

   As an example of public availability of YANG modules for published
   standards, IEEE 802.1 provides a public list of ASCII files for MIB
   (see http://www.ieee802.org/1/files/public/MIBs/ and
   http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/MIBS.html), and analogous lists are
   planned for IEEE 802.1 YANG files.
