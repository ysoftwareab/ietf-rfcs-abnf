Introduction

   This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the TLS
   protocol 1.0 [TLS] to support SEED and HAS-160.

   The SEED algorithm is 128-bit symmetric block cipher algorithm.
   [SEED] The HAS-160 is 160-bit secure hash function, whose block size
   is 512 bit. [HAS] Both algorithms are developed in Korea since 1997
   for stronger communication security.  Currently, SEED is widely used
   and is the mandatory cipher in banking and stock applications in
   Korea.

HMAC of HAS-160

   HMAC of HAS160 can be defined like HMAC_MD5 or HMAC_SHA1.  Since
   HAS-160 is 512-bit block, 160-bit output secure hash algorithm, B=64
   and L=20 as the notation of [HMAC].

   The test values of HMAC_HAS160 is provided as appendix of this

   document.

   HMAC_HAS160 is used just for MAC of record layer. Adding HMAC_HAS160
   does not affect the definitions of PRF, Finished message and other
   definitions using HMAC_MD5 or HMAC_SHA1.

Cipher Suites

   In spite of the existence of Korean digital signature algorithm,
   KCDSA, RSA algorithm is more widely used in Korea. Therefore, we
   define cipher suites with RSA key exchange.

      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_MD5          = { 0x00, 0x2C };
      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_SHA          = { 0x00, 0x2D };
      CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_SEED_CBC_HAS160       = { 0x00, 0x2E };

      Note: The above numeric definitions for Cipher Suites have not yet
      been registered. The numeric definitions are the following numbers
      of CipherSuite of TLS standard.[TLS]
