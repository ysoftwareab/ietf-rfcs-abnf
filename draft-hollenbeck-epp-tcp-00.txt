1. Introduction

  This document describes how an EPP session is mapped onto a single TCP
  connection.  EPP is described in [EPP].  TCP is described in [RFC793].

  This document is being discussed on the "rrp" mailing list.  To join
  the list, send a message to <majordomo@NSIRegistry.net> with the words
  "subscribe rrp" in the body of the message.  There is a web site for
  the list archives at <http://www.NSIRegistry.net/maillist/rrp>.

2. Session Management

  Mapping EPP session management facilities onto the TCP service is
  straight forward.  An EPP session first requires creation of a TCP
  connection between two peers, one that initiates the connection
  request and one that responds to the connection request.  The
  initiating peer is called the "client", and the responding peer is
  called the "server".  An EPP server MUST listen for TCP connection
  requests on a standard TCP port.  TCP port 65000 should be used for
  development and testing purposes in advance of a port assignment from
  IANA.

  The client MUST issue an active OPEN call, specifying the TCP port
  number on which the server is listening for EPP connection attempts.
  The server MUST respond with a passive OPEN call, which the client
  MUST acknowledge to establish the connection.  The EPP server MUST
  return an EPP <greeting> to the client after the TCP session has been
  established.

  An EPP session is nominally ended by the client issuing an EPP
  <logout> command.  A server receiving an EPP <logout> command MUST end
  the EPP session and close the TCP connection through an active CLOSE
  call.  The client MUST respond with a passive CLOSE call.

  A client MAY end an EPP session by issuing an active CLOSE call.  A
  server SHOULD respond with a passive CLOSE call.

  A server MAY limit the life span of an established TCP connection.
  EPP sessions that are inactive for more than 10 minutes MAY be ended
  by a server issuing an active CLOSE call.  A server MAY close TCP
  connections that have been open and active for more than 24 continuous
  hours.

  Peers SHOULD respond to an active CLOSE call with a passive CLOSE
  call.  The closing peer MAY issue an ABORT call if the responding peer
  does not respond to the active CLOSE call.

3. Message Exchange

  With the exception of the EPP server greeting, EPP messages are
  initiated by the EPP client in the form of EPP commands.  An EPP
  server MUST return an EPP response to an EPP command on the same TCP
  connection that carried the command.  If the TCP connection is closed
  after a server receives and successfully processes a command but
  before the response can be returned to the client, the server MUST
  undo the effects of the command to ensure a consistent state between
  the client and the server.

  An EPP client streams EPP commands to an EPP server on an established
  TCP connection.  A client MAY establish multiple TCP connections to
  facilitate multiple command exchange channels.  A server MAY limit a
  client to a maximum number of TCP connections based on server
  capabilities and operational load.

  An EPP command MUST be a well-formed XML instance.  An EPP command
  begins with an OPTIONAL (but RECOMMENDED) XML processing instruction,
  followed by an <epp> element, EPP child elements, and ending with an
  </epp> element.  A server MUST receive data from a client until an
  </epp> element is received, signaling the end of a potentially well-
  formed XML instance.  XML parsing and command processing begins after
  the server has received an </epp> element.

  A server SHOULD impose a limit of 10 minutes on the amount of time
  required for a client to issue a well-formed EPP command.  A server
  SHOULD end an EPP session and close an open TCP connection if a well-
  formed command is not received within the time limit.

4. Internationalization Considerations

  This mapping does not introduce or present any internationalization
  issues.

5. IANA Considerations

  Mapping EPP onto TCP requires a TCP port assignment from IANA for
  public operation.  TCP port 65000 should be used for development and
  testing purposes in advance of a port assignment from IANA.

6. Security Considerations

  EPP as-is provides only simple client authentication services using
  identifiers and plain text passwords.  A passive attack is sufficient
  to recover client identifiers and passwords, allowing trivial command
  forgery.  Protection against all common attacks must be provided by
  other protocols.

  When layered over TCP, EPP MUST be used with the Transport Layer
  Security (TLS) Protocol described in [RFC2246] to prevent
  eavesdropping, tampering, command forgery, and replay attacks.
  Implementations of TLS often contain a US-exportable cryptographic
  mode that SHOULD NOT be used to protect EPP.  Clients and servers
  desiring high security SHOULD instead use TLS with cryptographic
  algorithms that are less susceptible to compromise.

  Mutual client and server authentication using the TLS Handshake
  Protocol is REQUIRED.  EPP service MUST NOT be granted until
  successful completion of a TLS handshake, ensuring that both client
  and server have been authenticated and cryptographic protections are
  in place.

  EPP TCP servers are vulnerable to common TCP denial of service attacks
  including TCP SYN flooding.  Servers SHOULD take steps to minimize the
  impact of a denial of service attack using combinations of easily
  implemented solutions, such as deployment of firewall technology and
  border router filters to restrict inbound server access to known,
  trusted clients.
