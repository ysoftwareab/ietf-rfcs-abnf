Abstract 

This document specifies the RTP payload format for encapsulating H.263 
bitstreams in the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP). Three modes are
defined for RTP H.263 payload header. An RTP packet can use one of the 
three modes for H.263 video streams depending on the desired 
performance characteristics and H.263 encoding options employed. 
The shortest header mode (Mode A) supports fragmentation 
at Group of Block (GOB) boundaries. The long header modes 
(Mode B and C) support fragmentation at Macroblock (MB) boundaries.

Internet Draft        RTP Payload for H.263            November 25, 1996


1. Introduction

This document describes a scheme to packetize an H.263 video stream for 
transport using RTP [1]. H.263 video stream is defined by ITU-T
Recommendation H.263 (referred to as H.263 in this document) [4] for 
video coding at very low bit rate. RTP is defined by the Internet 
Engineering Task Force (IETF) to provide end-to-end network transport 
functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data over 
multicast or unicast network services.

The complete specification of RTP for a particular application will 
require a profile specification document [3], a payload format 
specification, and an RTP protocol document [1]. This document is 
intended to serve as the payload format specification for H.263 video 
streams.

2. Definitions

For the purpose of this document, the following definitions apply:

CIF: Common Intermediate Format. For H.263, a CIF picture has 352 x 288 
pixels for luminance, and 176 x 144 pixels for chrominance.

QCIF: Quarter CIF source format with 176 x 144 pixels for luminance and
88 x 72 pixels for chrominance.

sub-QCIF:  picture source format with 128 x 96 pixels for luminance and
64 x 48 pixels for chrominance.

4CIF: picture source format with 704 x 576 pixels for luminance and
352 x 288 pixels for chrominance.

16CIF: picture source format with 1408 x 1152 pixels for luminance and 
704 x 576 pixels for chrominance.

GOB: for H.263, a Group of Blocks (GOB) comprises of  k*16 lines, 
depending on the picture format (k=1 for QCIF, CIF and sub-QCIF, k=2 
for 4CIF and k=3 for 16CIF).

MB: a macroblock (MB) relates to four blocks of luminance and the 
spatially corresponding two blocks of chrominance. Each block consists 
of 8x8 pixels.

3. Design Issues for Packetizing H.263 Bitstream

H.263 is based on the ITU-T Recommendation H.261 [2] (referred to as 
H.261 in this document). Although it employs similar techniques to 
reduce both temporal and spatial redundancy, there are several major 
differences between the two algorithms that impact the design of 
packetization schemes significantly. This section summarizes those 
differences.

Zhu                                                             [Page 2]


Internet Draft         RTP Payload for H.263           November 25, 1996

3.1 Optional Features of H.263
 
In addition to the basic source coding algorithms, H.263 supports four 
negotiable features to improve performance: Advanced Prediction, PB 
frames, Syntax-based Arithmetic Coding, and Unrestricted Motion Vectors.
They can be used in any combination. 
 
Advanced Prediction(AP): four motion vectors instead of one can be used 
for some macroblocks in the frame. This feature makes recovery from 
packet loss harder, because more redundant information has to be 
preserved at the beginning of the packet when fragmenting at macroblock 
boundaries.
 
PB frames:  two frames ( P frame and B frame) are coded into one 
bitstream with macroblocks from the two frames interleaved. From a 
packetization point of view, a MB from the P frame and a MB from the B 
frame must be treated together because each MB for the B frame are coded 
based on the corresponding MB for the P frame. A means must be provided 
to ensure proper rendering of two frames in the right order. Also if 
part of this combined bitstream is lost, it will effect the two frames, 
and possibly more.
 
Syntax-based Arithmetic Coding (SAC): Huffman codes are not the only 
choice for variable length coding. When the SAC option is on, the 
resultant run value pair after quantization of Discrete Cosine 
Transform (DCT) coefficients will be coded differently from Huffman 
codes, but the macroblock hierarchy will be preserved. Since context 
variables are only synchronized before fixed length codes in the 
bitstream, any fragmentation at variable length codes will result in 
difficulty in decoding in the presence of packet loss without carrying 
the values of all the context variables in each packet header.  
 
Unrestricted motion vector feature also has impact on packetization 
because of larger range of motion vector than normal. 

To enable proper decoding of packets received without dependency on 
previous packets, the use of these optional features is signaled in the 
H.263 payload header, as described in section 5.

3.2 GOB Numbering

In H.263, each picture is divided into groups of blocks (GOB). GOBs are 
numbered by vertical scan of the GOBs, starting with the upper GOB and 
ending with the lower GOB. In contrast, a GOB in  H.261 is composed of 
three rows of 16x16 MB for QCIF, and three half rows of MB for CIF 
format. Like H.261, a GOB is divided into macroblocks in H.263. The 
definition of a macroblock in H.263 is the same as in H.261. 

Each GOB in H.263 can have a fixed GOB header, but unlike H.261 the use 
of the header is optional. If the GOB header is present, it may or may 
not start on a byte boundary. Byte alignment can be achieved by proper 
bit stuffing by the encoder, but it is not required.

Zhu                                                             [Page 3]


Internet Draft         RTP Payload for H.263           November 25, 1996


In summary, a GOB in H.263 is defined and coded with finer granularity 
with the same source format, thus resulting in more flexibility for 
packetization than with H.261.



3.3 Motion Vectors Encoding

Differential coding is used to code motion vectors as variable length 
codes. Unlike in H.261, where each motion vector is predicted from the 
previous MB in the GOB, H.263 employs a more flexible prediction scheme,
where three candidate predictors are used instead of one. It is done 
differently depending on the presence of GOB header. 

If the GOB header is included for a GOB, motion vectors are coded with 
reference to MBs in the current GOB only. But if the GOB header is not 
present for the current GOB, three motion vectors must be available to 
decode one macroblock, where two of them are from the previous GOB. To 
decode the whole inter-coded GOB, all the motion vectors must be 
available from the previous GOB. This can be a major problem for a 
packetization scheme like the one defined for H.261 when packetizing 
at MB boundaries. 

Let's assume a packet starts with one MB but the GOB header is not 
coded. If the previous packet is lost, then all the motion vectors 
to predict the motion vector for the MBs in this GOB are not available. 
In order to decode the received MBs correctly, all the motion vectors 
for the previous GOB would have to be saved at the beginning of the 
packet. This would be very expensive and unacceptable in terms of 
bandwidth overhead.

The encoding strategy of each H.263 codec implementation is beyond 
the scope of this document, even though it has very significant impact 
on visual quality in the presence of packet loss. However, we strongly
recommend use of the GOB header for every GOB at the beginning of 
a packet to address these problems. 


3.4 Macroblock Address

As specified by H.261, macroblock address (MBA) is encoded with a 
variable length code to indicate the position of a macroblock within 
a group of blocks in the H.261 bitstream. H.263 does not code the MBA 
explicitly, but the macroblock address within a GOB is necessary to 
recover the decoder state in the presence of packet loss when 
fragmenting at MB boundaries. Therefore, this information must be 
included in the H.263 payload header for two of the modes 
(Mode B and Mode C as described in section 5) that allow packetization 
at MB boundaries.

4. Usage of RTP

When transmitting H.263 video streams over the Internet, we will 
directly packetize the output of the encoder. All the bits resulting 
from the bitstream including the fixed length codes and  variable 
length codes (Huffman codes, or SAC if SAC is used) will be included 
in the packet. Also we do not intend to multiplex audio and video 
signals in the same packets, as UDP and RTP provide a much more 
efficient way to achieve multiplexing.

RTP does not guarantee a reliable and orderly data delivery service, 
so a packet might get lost in the network. To achieve a best-effort 
recovery from packet loss, the decoder needs assistance to proceed with 
decoding of other packets that are received. Thus it is desirable to 
be able to process each packet independent of other packets. 
Some frame level information is included in each packet, such as source 
format and flags for optional features to assist the decoder in 
operating correctly and efficiently in presence of packet loss. The 
flags for H.263 optional features also provide information about 
coding options used in the H.263 video streams that can be used by 
session management tools.

The H.263 video stream will be carried as payload data within the RTP 
packets. A new H.263 payload header is defined in section 5, H.263 
payload header. This section defines the usage of RTP fixed header 
and H.263 video packet structure. 

4.1 RTP Header usage

Each RTP packet starts with a fixed RTP header. The following fields of 
the RTP fixed header are used for H.263 video stream:

Marker bit (M bit): The Marker bit of the RTP header  is set to 1 
when the current packet carries the end of current frame. 0 otherwise.
 
Payload Type (PT): The Payload Type shall specify H.263 video payload 
format.
 
Timestamp: The RTP Timestamp encodes the sampling instance of the first 
video frame contained in the RTP data packet. The RTP timestamp may be 
the same  on successive packets if a video frame occupies more than one 
packet. For H.263 video stream, the RTP timestamp is based on a 90 kHz 
clock, the same as that of RTP payload for H.261 stream. 
 
4.2 Video Packet Structure

H.263 compressed bitstream is carried as payload within each RTP packet.
For each RTP packet, the RTP header is followed by the H.263 payload 
header, which is followed by the standard H.263 compressed bitstream. 
The size of the H.263 payload header is variable depending on modes 
used as detailed in the next section. The layout of the RTP H.263 
video packet is shown as:

5. H.263 Payload Header

For H.263 video streams, each RTP packet carries only one H.263 video
packet. The H.263 payload header is always present for each H.263 video 
packet. 

Three formats (Mode A, Mode B and Mode C) are defined for RTP H.263 
payload header. In Mode A, a H.263 payload header of four bytes is 
present before actual compressed H.263 video bitstream in the packet. 
It allows fragmentation at GOB boundaries. In Mode B, a eight byte H.263
payload header is used and each packet starts at MB boundaries with the 
PB frame option off. Finally, Mode C with a 12 bytes header is provided 
to support fragmentation at MB boundaries for frames that are coded with
the PB frame option on. The mode is indicated by the F field and P field
in the first two bits of the header. The three modes can be intermixed 
for one compressed frame. All the client application are required to 
be able to receive packets in all three modes, but decoding of Mode C 
packets is optional because PB-frame is an optional feature of H.263  
decoder.

In this section, the H.263 payload format is shown as rows of 32-bit 
word. Each word is transmitted in network byte order with the most 
significant byte shown at the left in the following diagrams.

5.1 Mode A

In this mode, H.263 bitstream will be packetized at GOB boundaries. 
In other words, each packet will start at the beginning of a GOB, and it 
can carry one or more MBs or GOBs. Only four bytes are used for the 
header. Mode A can be used with or without PB frame option. For those
GOBs that are smaller than network packet size, this mode is 
recommended. The H.263 payload header definition for Mode A is shown 
as follows with F=0.

 0                   1                   2                   3

Optional PB-frame mode as defined by the H.263 [4]. "0" implies normal 
I or P frame, "1" PB-frame. When F=1, P also indicates modes. Mode B 
if P=0, Mode C if P=1.

zero if PB frame option is off.

TR: 8 bits
Temporal Reference for the P frame as defined by the H.263 [4]. Set to 
zero if the PB frame option is off.
 
5.2 Mode B

In this mode, the H.263 stream can be fragmented at MB boundaries. Thus 
necessary information is needed at the start of a packet to recover 
the decoder internal state in the presence of packet loss. It is 
intended for those GOBs whose sizes are larger than the maximum packet 
size allowed in the underlying protocol. This mode can only 
be used with PB frame option off. Mode C as defined in the next section 
can be used to fragment at MB boundaries with PB frame option on. The 
H.263 payload header definition for Mode B is shown as follows with 
F=1 and P=0:

 
 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



The following fields are defined the same as in Mode A: F, P, SBIT, 
EBIT, SRC, I, A, S, V and U. Other fields are defined as follows:

QUANT: 5 bits
Quantization value for the first MB coded at the starting of the packet.  
Set to 0 if the packet begins with a GOB header. This is the equivalent 
of GQUANT defined by the H.263 [4].
 
GOBN: 5 bits
GOB number in effect at the start of the packet. GOB number is specified
differently for different resolutions. See H.263 [4] for details.
 
MBA: 8 bits
The absolute address of the first MB within its GOB, counting from 0.
 
HMV1, VMV1: 7 bits each.
Horizontal and vertical motion vector predictors for the first MB coded 
in this packet from the MB on the left. The same as MV1 defined by 
H.263 [4]. 



Zhu                                                             [Page 8]


Internet Draft        RTP Payload for H.263            November 25, 1996

HMV2, VMV2, 7 bits each.
Horizontal and vertical motion vector predictors from the block or MB 
on the left of block number 3 in the current MB when advanced prediction
option is on. They are the same as MV1 defined for block number 3 in 
H.263 [4]. This is needed because block number 3 in the first MB needs 
the motion vector predictor from the block to its left, as block number 
1. These two fields are not used when advanced prediction is off and 
must be set to 0. See the H.263 [4] for block organization in a frame.

R: 1 bit                      
Reserved, must set to zero.
 
5.3 Mode C
                
In this mode, H.263 stream can be fragmented at MB boundaries of P 
frames when the PB frame option is on. It is intended for those GOBs 
whose sizes are larger than the maximum packet size allowed in the 
underlying protocol. H.263 payload header definition for 
Mode C is shown as follows with F=1 and P=1:

 0                   1                   2                   3
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



The following fields are defined the same as in Mode A: F, P, SBIT, 
EBIT, SRC, I, A, S, U, V, R, TR, DBQ, TRB, and the rest of the fields 
are defined the same as in Mode B, except field RR of 19 bits is 
reserved and its value must be zero.

5.4 Selection of Modes for the H.263 Payload Header

Packets with different modes can be intermixed. The modes shall be 
selected carefully based on performance characteristics, H.263 coding 
modes and underlying network protocols.

We strongly recommend use of Mode A whenever possible. The major 
advantage of Mode A over Mode B and C is its simplicity. The header is 
one half and one third of the size of Mode B and C respectively. 
Transmission overhead is reduced and the savings may be very 
significant when working with very low bit rates, especially when low 
latency is desired.




Zhu                                                             [Page 9]


Internet Draft         RTP Payload for H.263           November 25, 1996


Another advantage of Mode A is that it simplifies error recovery in the
presence of packet loss. The internal state of the decoder can be 
recovered at GOB boundaries instead of having to synchronize with MBs 
as in Mode B and C. The GOB headers and the picture start code are 
easy to identify,  and their presence will normally cause the H.263 
decoder to re-synchronize its internal states. Requiring the decoder to 
synchronize its internal states at MBs introduces extra overhead and 
complexity for the decoder.

Mode A shall be used for packets starting with a GOB of size smaller 
than the network packet size. The major disadvantage of Mode A is lack 
of flexibility in packetization when a GOB can not fit in a network 
packet. 

Mode B has the advantage of flexibility with fragmentation at MB 
boundaries with PB frame option off. This mode is necessary when a 
GOB is larger than the network packet size. It has the disadvantage of 
higher overhead with a long header of 8 bytes. For small packets, this 
may not be desirable. Mode C is the same as B, except it allows 
fragmentation with PB option on at the price of 4 additional bytes.

Finally, we would like to emphasize that recovery from packet loss 
will depend on the decoder's ability to use the information provided 
in the H.263 payload header within the RTP packets.
