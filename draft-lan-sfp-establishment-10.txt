Abstract

   Service Function Chain architecture leads to more adaptive network
   nodes. It allows splitting the network function into fine-grained
   build blocks --- service function, and combining the network
   functions into service function chain to formulate complicated
   services. Further, the service function chain should be instantiated
   by selecting the optimal instance from the candidates for each
   service function in it. This document discusses the required
   components during the instantiation of service function chain in the
   network.

1.  Introduction

   The end-to-end services delivery often present various demands for
   different functions including the traditional functions and
   diversified novel ones such as application-specific features.
   However, the rigidly fixed model of service function in the legacy
   network chain lacks in adaptability for that circumstance. It cannot
   fulfill the current various requirements of end users or
   applications, such as cross layer in the wireless network.

   Accordingly, service function chain is provided to enhance the
   network flexibility and adaptability. It consists of several service
   functions in a special order that the corresponding packets or flows
   should drill through them. The network administrative entity could
   "insert" or "disable" a service function in the service function
   chain based on the new dynamic demands.

   Service function chain architecture splits the network functions into
   finer-grained service functions. It then decouples the service
   functions from the underlying physical topology, and enables the new
   placement and combination of service functions viable. In the SFC-
   enabled domain, many service function instances will co-exist
   provided by different vendors. Before SFC deploys to delivery packets
   or flows, it must be instantiated by selecting instances distributed
   in the network for each service functions.

   This document outlines the required components regarding to the
   service function path including the establishment, deletion,
   modification/update based on the policy.

3.  Terminology and Abbreviations

3.1.  The Terminology
   This document uses the terminology defined in the SFC Problem
   Statement [I-D.quinn-sfc-problem-statement] and the SFC Framework &
   Architecture [I-D.boucadair-sfc-framework]. Additional terminology is
   defined below:

   Service Function Instance: A Service Function Instance locating in a
   service node deals with the specific packets based on the function

   logic declared.

   Service Function Path: The Service Function Path is the instantiation
   of a service function chain in the network. It consists of the
   service function instances in the service function chain.

   Service Information Base: A Service Information Base is a data
   structure tracking the information about the service functions. It
   must include the location of service functions, service type (e.g.,
   load balancer, firewall), and managed information such as the load,
   capacity and current status of service function. SIBs may be
   configured and managed by the administrative entity that operates the
   SFC-enabled domain. SIBs also may be automatically updated by the
   service function discover. In the distributed mode, SIB's replicas
   could be distributed over the SFC-enabled domain.

   Topology Information Base: A Topology Information Base stores the
   Physical network infrastructure topology. Its replicas can be placed
   in the same network node with SIB, or in a separate one. In the
   distributed mode, TIB's replicas could be distributed over the SFC-
   enabled domain.

   SFP-enabled Management Entity: SFP-enabled Management Entity is
   responsible for the establishment, deletion, modification/update of
   SFPs for various SFC.

4.  Core components for SFP

      The establishment of a SFP which consists of multiple service
      functions (SFs), needs to select one service function instance
      (SFI) from multiple SFIs distributed in the network for each
      service function. To make decision, service function (SF) node
      information and underlying topology information need to be
      collected automatically and periodily. The following sections
      describe the framework and data structures to store SF information
      and topology information for the establishment of SFP.

             Figure 1 Core components for SFP establishment

   As shown in figure 1, the core components of SFP include PDP, SFP-ME,
   SF information base (SIB), and topology information base (TIB). As

   defined in [I.D- boucadair-sfc-framework], the PDP is the central
   entity which is responsible for maintaining SFC policy Tables, and
   enforcing appropriate policies in SF nodes and SFC Boundary Nodes. In
   addition, the PDP in this document is also responsible for creating
   SFCs according to the requirements of applications or profits of
   vendors. The SIB stores the SF information which includes SF
   identity, SF locator, SF type, SF capacity, SF load and SF status. SF
   information can be collected from SFC-enabled domain by using IGP or
   BGP-LS [I.D-draft-idr-ls-distribution]. The TIB is used to store
   underlying physical network infrastructure topology information which
   can be collected form network by using IGP or BGP-LS [I.D-draft-idr-
   ls-distribution]. The SFP-ME is responsible for establishing,
   deleting, and modified SFP according to SFC made by PDP, SF
   information, and topology information. The SFP-ME is also responsible
   for SFP management.  
4.2.  SIB structure

   The SF information stored by SIB is used to establish or update SFP
   by SFP-ME. The SIB structure is defined in Fig.2. The following
   entries are defined in the SIB.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |Index|SF identity|SF locator|SF type|SF capacity|SF load|SF status|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                         Figure 2 SIB structure


   Index: denotes the sequence that a SF entry locates in the SIB. The
   index can be used to lookup the SF entry quickly.

   SF identity: is used to identify the SF and is unique in SFP-ME
   enabled domain. Each SF has an unique identity. The service function
   server is responsible for the SF identity management and allocation.

   SF locator: represents the SF node where the SF locates. The SF
   locator is non-exclusive. Multiple SFs could locate in one SF node or
   multiple different SF nodes. 

   SF type: denotes the type of a SF. SFs can be classified into
   different classes which include firewall, DPI (Deep Packet
   Inspection), load balancer, etc. The definition of SF can refer to
   [I.D- boucadair-sfc-framework]. In this document, the SFs may be
   service functions in layer 3 or service functions in layer 4-7.

   SF capacity: represents the capacity to process the traffic. The same
   service function may have multiple service functions in different
   capacities.

INTERNET DRAFT    Service Function Path Establishment     September 21, 2020


   SF load: denotes the current traffic load steering a SF. The SFP-ME
   can establish or update SFP according to SF load.

   SF status: denotes the current status of a SF. The SF status includes
   available, congestion, unavailable, etc. The exact definition of SF
   status is application-specific.

4.3.  TIB structure

   The underlying physical network topology information is used to
   deploy SFs for establishing or updating SFP according some optimal
   criterions or the profit of vendors. The TIB is used to store network
   topology information. The structure of TIB can be defined in
   different formats, e.g. routing information table etc. Fig. 3 shows a
   definition of the TIB structure. The following entries are defined in
   the TIB.

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+   +-+-+-+-+-+--+
       | SF node |  number | Neighbor 1 | Neighbor 1 |...| Neighbor N |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+--+   +-+-+-+-+-+--+

                         Figure 3 TIB structure

   SF node: denotes the SF node which reports the information. The
   identifier of SF node can be flat identifier or hierarchical
   identifier, e.g. IP address.

   Number: denotes the number of neighbor nodes.

   Neighbor: denotes the neighbor node of the current SF node. A SF node
   may have multiple neighbor nodes.


5.  SFP management

   SFP aims to provide SFC an optimal/near-optimal path on underlying
   physical network, ensuring network function represented by the
   specific SFC can be implemented with required or even higher
   performance. Operations of SPF refer to establishment, deletion and
   update and are conducted by SFP-ME.

   The SFP-ME in this document includes a service function pre-selection
   (SFPS), classifier, service function path calculation (SFPC) and
   service chain-path base (SCPB), as shown in Figure 4. The SFPS is
   used to select candidate nodes for SFP establishment. The classifier
   is used to determine which cost function is taken for SFP
   establishment and transfer SFP deletion and update information to
   SFPC. The SFPC is used to fulfill SFP establishment, deletion and

INTERNET DRAFT    Service Function Path Establishment     September 21, 2020


   update. The SCPB stores service function chain-path mapping
   information and is used for SFP deletion.

   A service function path header should be added to encapsulated
   packets or frames to represent service function paths. The service
   function path header should be independent of the underlying
   transport and can be encapsulated inside any transport mechanism.
   There are several approaches to encapsulate service function path
   header as described in Metadata Considerations [I-D.rijsman-sfc-
   metadata-considerations], Service Chain Header [I-D.zhang-sfc-sch],
   Network Service Header[I-D.quinn-sfc-nsh] and so on.

   To implement SPF establishment, deletion and update, SFP-ME need to
   interact with NIB, TIB, PDP by using a variety of protocols, such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241],PCEP[I-D.wu-pce-traffic-steering-sfc], etc.

   SFP establishment refers to determining the optimal/near-optimal
   service node for each service function on SFC and finding the
   optimal/near-optimal path for the instantiated service nodes of a
   given SFC such that the required service functions are executed in
   sequence required by SFC with minimal costs. 

   The term of cost is user-defined and can be end-to-end delay,
   resource consumption and so on. There may exist only one cost
   definition which can be applied to all SFC in the same domain, or may
   co-exist several different cost definitions with each one targeting
   at different types of SFC. Cost must be expressed as a function, i.e.
   cost function. Trying to minimize the cost, several algorithms can be
   applied based on different cases.

   When SFC is generated based on policy in PDP, SFP-ME receives SFC
   information and start to execute SFP establishment. The SFP
   establishment processes in three steps, as shown in Figure 5. 

   Firstly, SNPS selects several service nodes as candidates, these
   service nodes must include one or more service function Instance of
   the given SFC and are currently available. Concurrently, classifier
   selects the appropriate cost function according to the type of the
   given SFC, this step can be omitted if there is only one cost
   function applied to all SFC in the same domain.

   Secondly, with the aim to minimize cost, SFPC applies algorithms to
   selects one service node for each service function of the given SFC
   from the candidates and builds a path making the service functions
   strictly executed with the ordered sequence. Thus an optimal/near-
   optimal SFP for SFC is established. 

   Lastly, Information of the established SFP is send to SFC entrance,
   meanwhile SCPB is updated.

5.2.  SFP deletion

   SFP deletion refers to releasing the overall service function
   Instantiations of the established SFP, thus the released service
   function Instantiations can be used for other SFP's establishment.

   SFP-ME starts to execute SFP deletion once PDP notifies that SFC has
   been deleted. Information of the to be deleted SFC is send to SFPC
   through classifier and match against the restored SFC in SCPB to find
   SFP for the given SFC, then SFPC notify SFC entrance that this
   specific SFP is invalid, meanwhile update SCPB.  The SFP deletion
   process is shown in Figure 6.

5.3.  SFP update

   SFP update refers to changing partial service function Instantiations
    or path of the established SFP, due to breakdown of partial service
   function nodes or physical links. 

   Breakdown of service function nodes or physical links can lead the
   established SFP to work improperly, re-establishment of SFP can be
   executed to guarantee function of the corresponding SFC is still
   implemented with optimal/near-optimal performance. SFP update is an
   alternative way. The updated SFP may perform worse than the re-
   establishment one, however, the update process takes up less time
   which can be very attractive to time-sensitive function.

   SFP-ME starts to execute SFP update once PDP notifies that SFP need
   to be updated. Information of the to be updated SFC is send to SFPC
   through classifier, SFPC selects adjacent service nodes or path to
   replace the ones which has been breakdown. Thus the given SFP is
   undated, Information of the undated SFP is send to SFC entrance. The
   SFP update process is shown in Figure 7.
