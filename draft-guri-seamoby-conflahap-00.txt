Abstract

   This document states the conformity of Layer-2 aided mobility
   independent dormant host alerting protocol I-D to RFC 3154 on
   Requirements and Functional Architecture for an IP Host Alerting
   Protocol. It is stated to which clauses lahap fully conforms and to
   which clauses close to full conformance is claimed.

                     Lahap Conformance Statement       September 2001


1. Introduction
   RFC 3154 [1] states the requirements and attempts to define a
   functional architecture for an IP Host Alerting Protocol. The authors
   of this I-D have submitted an I-D, Layer-2 aided mobility independent
   dormant host alerting protocol [2] which defines an IP host alerting
   protocol. In this draft we discuss the clauses where lahap conforms
   to [1] and where the conformity can easily be achieved. There seems
   to be no clauses where the conformity to [1] could not be claimed.



2. Terms

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [3].

   Please see [4] for definition of terms used in describing paging. In
   addition, [2] defined several terms.

3. Where we claim full conformity

   The clauses on security, in particular clauses in Section 3.1, 3.2
   and 3.3.
   4.1 on power consumption by relying on L2 paging where available the
   need to establish L3 connection is eliminated.
   4.3 on control of Broadcast/Multicast/Anycast. lahap additionaly has
   provisions to support more dormant mode options.
   4.4. On Inactive mode: The protocol as support for inactive mode.
   Protocl detects as soon as host enters inactive mode and sends
   ICMP_HOST_UNREACHABLE message back to the node trying to connect to
   HOST.
   4.5 on no mobile routers.
   4.7 on independence of mobility protocols. Lahap is completely
   independent of any mobility protocol.
   4.9 on dormant mode termination.
   4.10 on network updates. Lahap efficiently supports the moving of the
   dormant hosts in paging areas. This is clearly explained in Section
   3.1.1 of [2].
   4.11 on Efficient Utilization of L2. Lahap makes maximum use of L2
   dormant mode support if available.
   4.12 on Orthogonality of Paging Area and Subnets and 4.13 on future
   L3 paging support. Lahap allows both Layer 3 and Layer 2 paging areas.
   It defines protocol operation distinctively under L3 paging areas or
   under L2 paging areas to be used based on availability.
   4.15 on   Reliability of Packet Delivery and 4.16 on  Robustness
   Against Message Loss. Lahap achieves reliability and robustness by
   acknowledging all the messages in the network layer. In appropriate
   scenarios, messages are retransmitted. Lahap uses IPv6 and ICMPv6
   datagrams. Every message has a corresponding reply and this is how
   reliability and robustness can be achieved.

                     Lahap Conformance Statement       September 2001


   4.18 on  Flexibility of Paging Area Design. Lahap allows maximum
   flexibility on the paging areas. The (L2 or L3) paging areas can even
   be dynamic.
   4.19   Availability of Security Support : last section of the draft
           deals with security issues. Lahap has the security support as
           required. Section 6 in [2] gives a detailed explaination of
           the security support.
   4.20   Through 4.22 on authentication support. [2] uses IPsec which
           provides the authentication.
   Clauses in Section 5 of [1] on functional architecture. We claim full
   conformance to Section 5. All the entities are used and the messaging
   structure is as in Section 5.

4. Where conformity can be easily achieved

   Clause 4.6 on multiple dormant modes.
   4.2  on scalability. The dormant mode hosts state is only kept at DMA
   4.14 on   Robustness Against Failure of Network Elements.
   4.17 on   Flexibility of Administration.
   4.23 on   Paging Volume. Presently Lahap handles each paging request
   per host separately. If the volume is high it may help in handling
   several paging requests together. Future revisions of [2] will
   conform to this clause fully.
   4.8 on support for mobility protocols.  Lahap is not based on any
   mobility protocols. Hooks to a protocol that extends Mobile IPv6 with
   paging can easily be made. For example DMA can be collocated with the
   home agent of MIPv6.
