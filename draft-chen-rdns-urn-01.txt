Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) for Uniform
   Resource Namespace (URN) resources to uniquely identify enterprise
   YANG modules.  This document defines a single top level "rdns"
   Namespace identifier (NID), with which organizations and enterprises
   can define Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespaces to uniquely
   identify enterprise YANG modules.

1.  Introduction

   The use of a standard data modeling language YANG [RFC6020] together
   with Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) [RFC6241] allows for
   the creation of a standard network management interface.  A
   networking device that supports such a standard network configuration
   interface supports NETCONF as well as a set of YANG modules, allowing
   administrators to manage data defined by the supported YANG modules
   in a single uniform manner, regardless of the make and model of the
   device.

   To identify YANG modules, RFC 6020 Section 5.3 [RFC6020] requires
   that each YANG module, whether it is a standard YANG module or not,
   specifies an XML namespace [XML-NAMES], and that the XML namespace
   must be a globally unique Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
   [RFC3986].  To date, IETF standard YANG modules registers their XML
   namespaces with the IETF XML namespaces [RFC3688] that fall under the
   "ietf" Namespace Identifier (NID).  Various standards governing
   bodies such as IEEE are also in the process of registering NIDs for
   their respective standard YANG module XML namespaces.

   As a shortcut, this document registers the "rdns" NID for
   organizations such as commercial companies or open source communities
   to create globally unique XML namespaces when they create and publish
   enterprise YANG modules.  An organization can use the "rdns" NID and
   append its registered domain name in reverse, followed by a string
   that is unique within its organization, to create a globally unique
   XML namespace for its enterprise YANG module without incurring extra
   effort to register a new NID.

2.  URN Specification for Enterprise YANG Module Namespace Identifier

   Namespace ID:

     Request "rdns"

   Registration Information:

     Version Number: 1

     Date: <when submitted to IANA>

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

     Registering organization: IETF Netmod Working Group

     Designated contact: ichen@kuatrotech.com

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

     URNs that use the "rdns" NID shall have the following structures:

     urn:rdns:<revers-dns>:<dss>

     The reverse registered domain name (revers-dns) is a mandatory
     string that is an organization's complete registered domain name in
     reverse.  The structure of the string is an organization's domain
     name from the least specific label to the most specific label,
     using colons (":") to separate labels.

     The domain specific string (dss) is a mandatory string defined by
     the organization.  The structure of this string is opaque.  It is a
     string that identifies the name or hierarchies of names the
     organization uses to identify its enterprise YANG module.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

     See [RFC1034] and [RFC1035] for definitions and conventions of
     registered domain names.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

     An organization that provides the domain specific string <dss> MUST
     guarantee the uniqueness of <dss> within its organization.  Using a
     <dss> that is unique within an organization in conjunction with a
     globally unique registered domain name (albeit in reverse) and the
     new "rdns" top-level NID, a URN is guaranteed to be globally
     unique.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

     Persistence of an "rdns" URN is dependent upon the organization
     that owns the registered domain name encoded in the URN to continue
     to own the domain name and also to not reassign the URN to a

     different YANG module.

   Process of identifier assignment:

     The assignment of an rdns URN is delegated to the organization that
     has registered the domain name encoded in the URN.

     For example, Ericsson registers for the domain name ericsson.com
     and can assign URNs with the prefix "urn:rdns:com:ericsson", where
     the <reverse-dns> portion of the URN is "com:ericsson".  As
     mentioned above, the <dss> portion of the URN is assigned by the
     registrant of the domain name ericsson.com.

   Process for identifier resolution:

     "rdns" URNs are not intended to be accessible for global
     resolution.  Rather, they are only intended to uniquely identify
     enterprise YANG modules (within a networking device).  Resolution
     of an "rdns" URN is delegated to the organization owning a
     registered domain name encoded in the URN.  If an organization that
     owns the registered domain name wishes for its "rdns" URNs to be
     resolvable, then the organization must register with the Resolution
     Discovery System [RFC2276].

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

     Because domain names are case-insensitive, the <reverse-dns>
     portion of the URN is case-insensitive for matches.  For the <dss>
     portion of the URN, the rules for lexical equivalence are specified
     in [RFC2141].

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

     No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

     Validation mechanism is controlled by the organization that owns
     the registered domain name.  If an "rdns" URN contains an invalid
     domain name in the <reverse-dns> portion, then the URN is invalid.

     In reality, an "rdns" URN is only meaningful in the context of YANG
     modules installed and supported in a device.  Consequently, the
     "rdns" URNs in use should all be valid.

   Scope:

     The scope of an "rdns" URN is limited to enterprise YANG modules.

3.  Namespace Considerations

   [RFC6020] suggests that for enterprise YANG modules to have globally
   unique XML namespaces, one possibility is to use Uniform Resource
   Locators (URLs) based on an organization's registered domain name.
   However, in addition to being a globally unique identifier, a URL is
   also a resource locator, providing information about the resource's
   primary access mechanism.  Consequently, an enterprise YANG module
   using a URL as its XML namespace also identifies the location of the
   resource, which is not necessarily the desired outcome.  For example,
   an enterprise forced to use a URL http://www.example.com/yang/ospf as
   its YANG module XML namespace might not wish to make the YANG module
   available via HTTP [RFC2616], even though that is what using a URL
   implies.  Using "rdns" URNs defined in this document yields globally
   unique XML namespaces which do not have the side effect of URLs that
   imply how to obtain resources.

4.  Community Considerations

   The "rdns" NID is intended for organizations such as enterprises and
   open source communities to easily create globally unique XML
   namespaces for enterprise YANG modules, without the need for all
   organizations to register their own NIDs.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security considerations beyond
   those associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new URN NID registration for "rdns" in IANA's
   "Formal URN Namespace" registry.  The completed registration template
   is in Section 2.
