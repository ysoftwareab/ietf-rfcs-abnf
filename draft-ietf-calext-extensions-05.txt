1.  Introduction

   The iCalendar [RFC5545] data format is used to represent calendar
   data and is used with iTIP [RFC5546] to handle scheduling operations
   between calendar users. iCalendar is in widespread use, and in
   accordance with provisions in that specification, extension elements
   have been added by various vendors to the data format in order to
   support and enhance capabilities.  This specification collects a
   number of these ad-hoc extensions and uses the new IANA registry
   capability defined in [RFC5545] to register standard variants with
   clearly defined definitions and semantics.  In addition, some new



Daboo                   Expires February 23, 2017               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions          August 2016


   elements are introduced for features that vendors have recently been
   requesting.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of [RFC5234] as
   used by iCalendar [RFC5545].  Any syntax elements shown below that
   are not explicitly defined in this specification come from iCalendar
   [RFC5545].

3.  Backwards Compatible Extension Properties

   iCalendar defines properties which can have different value types
   indicated by a "VALUE" parameter.  The definition of a property
   specifies a "default" value type that is assumed to be used when no
   "VALUE" parameter is present.  However, this poses a problem to
   iCalendar parser/generator software that does not know about the
   default values for new properties.  For example, if a new property
   "FOO" were defined with a default value type of URI, and a URI value
   with a comma was used, an iCalendar generator not aware of this fact
   would likely treat the property value as "TEXT" and apply backslash
   escaping to the comma in the value, effectively making it an invalid
   URI value.

   To avoid this problem, this specification recommends that all
   properties not defined in [RFC5545], always include a "VALUE"
   parameter, if the type is other than "TEXT". i.e., in the example
   above, the "FOO" property would have a "VALUE=URI" parameter.  This
   allows iCalendar parser/generator software to track the correct types
   of unknown properties.

   New properties defined in this specification use the term "no
   default" in the "Value Type" definition to indicate that the "VALUE"
   parameter has to be included.

4.  Modifications to Calendar Components

   The following changes to the syntax defined in iCalendar [RFC5545]
   are made here.  New elements are defined in subsequent sections.

5.  Properties

5.1.  NAME Property

   Property Name:  NAME

   Purpose:  This property specifies the name of the calendar.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, alternate text
      representation, and language property parameters can be specified
      on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in an
      iCalendar object.  However, each property MUST represent the name
      of the calendar in a different language.

   Description:  This property is used to specify a name of the
      iCalendar object that can be used by calendar user agents when
      presenting the calendar data to a user.  Whilst a calendar only
      has a single name, multiple language variants can be specified by
      including this property multiple times with different "LANGUAGE"
      parameter values on each.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   name       = "NAME" nameparam ":" text CRLF

   nameparam  = *(
                 ;
                 ; The following are OPTIONAL,
                 ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                 ;
                 (";" altrepparam) / (";" languageparam) /
                 ;
                 ; The following is OPTIONAL,
                 ; and MAY occur more than once.
                 ;
                 (";" other-param)
                 ;
                 )

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

   NAME:Company Vacation Days

5.2.  DESCRIPTION Property

   This specification modifies the definition of the "DESCRIPTION"
   property to allow it to be defined on an iCalendar object.  The
   following additions are made to the definition of this property,
   originally specified in Section 3.8.1.5 of [RFC5545].

   Purpose:  This property specifies the description of the calendar.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in an
      iCalendar object.  However, each property MUST represent the
      description of the calendar in a different language.

   Description:  This property is used to specify a lengthy textual
      description of the iCalendar object that can be used by calendar
      user agents when describing the nature of the calendar data to a
      user.  Whilst a calendar only has a single description, multiple
      language variants can be specified by including this property
      multiple times with different "LANGUAGE" parameter values on each.

5.3.  UID Property

   This specification modifies the definition of the "UID" property to
   allow it to be defined on an iCalendar object.  The following
   additions are made to the definition of this property, originally
   specified in Section 3.8.4.7 of [RFC5545].

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions          August 2016


   Purpose:  This property specifies the persistent, globally unique
      identifier for the iCalendar object.  This can be used, for
      example, to identify duplicate calendar streams that a client may
      have been given access to.  It can be used in conjunction with the
      "LAST-MODIFIED" property also specified on the "VCALENDAR" object,
      to identify the most recent version of a calendar.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in an iCalendar
      object.

   The description of the "UID" property in [RFC5545] contains some
   recommendations on how the value can be constructed.  In particular,
   it suggests use of host names, IP addresses, and domain names to
   construct the value.  However, this is no longer considered good
   practice, particularly from a security and privacy standpoint, since
   use of such values can leak key information about a calendar user, or
   their client and network environment.  This specification updates
   [RFC5545] by stating that "UID" values MUST NOT include any data that
   might identify a user, host, domain, or any other security or privacy
   sensitive information.  It is RECOMMENDED that calendar user agents
   now generate "UID" values that are hex-encoded random UUID values as
   defined in Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of [RFC4122].

   The following is an example of such a property value:

   UID:5FC53010-1267-4F8E-BC28-1D7AE55A7C99

   Additionally, if calendar user agents choose to use other forms of
   opaque identifiers for the "UID" value, they MUST have a length less
   than 255 octets, and MUST conform to the "iana-token" ABNF syntax
   defined in Section 3.1 of [RFC5545].

5.4.  LAST-MODIFIED Property

   This specification modifies the definition of the "LAST-MODIFIED"
   property to allow it to be defined on an iCalendar object.  The
   following additions are made to the definition of this property,
   originally specified in Section 3.8.7.3 of [RFC5545].

   Purpose:  This property specifies the date and time that the
      information associated with the calendar was last revised.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in an iCalendar
      object.

5.5.  URL Property

   This specification modifies the definition of the "URL" property to
   allow it to be defined on an iCalendar object.  The following
   additions are made to the definition of this property, originally
   specified in Section 3.8.4.6 of [RFC5545].

   Purpose:  This property may be used to convey a location where a more
      dynamic rendition of the calendar information can be found.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in an iCalendar
      object.

5.6.  CATEGORIES Property

   This specification modifies the definition of the "CATEGORIES"
   property to allow it to be defined on an iCalendar object.  The
   following additions are made to the definition of this property,
   originally specified in Section 3.8.1.2 of [RFC5545].

   Purpose:  This property defines the categories for an entire
      calendar.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in an
      iCalendar object.

   Description:  When multiple properties are present, the set of
      categories that apply to the iCalendar object are the union of all
      the categories listed in each property value.

5.7.  REFRESH-INTERVAL Property

   Property Name:  REFRESH-INTERVAL

   Purpose:  This property specifies a suggested minimum interval for
      polling for changes of the calendar data from the original source
      of that data.

   Value Type:  DURATION - no default

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in an iCalendar
      object.

   Description:  This property specifies a positive duration that gives
      a suggested minimum polling interval for checking for updates to

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions          August 2016


      the calendar data.  The value of this property SHOULD be used by
      calendar user agents to limit the polling interval for calendar
      data updates to the minimum interval specified.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   refresh      = "REFRESH-INTERVAL" refreshparam
                    ":" dur-value CRLF
                    ;consisting of a positive duration of time.

   refreshparam = *(
                   ;
                   ; The following is REQUIRED,
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                   ;
                   (";" "VALUE" "=" "DURATION") /
                   ;
                   ; The following is OPTIONAL,
                   ; and MAY occur more than once.
                   ;
                   (";" other-param)
                   ;
                   )

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

   REFRESH-INTERVAL;VALUE=DURATION:P1W

5.8.  SOURCE Property

   Property Name:  SOURCE

   Purpose:  This property identified a URI where calendar data can be
      refreshed from.

   Value Type:  URI - no default

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in an iCalendar
      object.

   Description:  This property identifies a location where a client can
      retrieve updated data for the calendar.  Clients SHOULD honor any
      specified "REFRESH-INTERVAL" value when periodically retrieving
      data.  Note that this property differs from the "URL" property in

      that "URL" is meant to provide an alternative representation of
      the calendar data, rather than the original location of the data.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   source       = "SOURCE" sourceparam ":" uri CRLF

   sourceparam = *(";" other-param)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

   SOURCE;VALUE=URI:https://example.com/holidays.ics

5.9.  COLOR Property

   Property Name:  COLOR

   Purpose:  This property specifies a color used for displaying the
      calendar, event, todo, or journal data.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified once in an iCalendar
      object, or "VEVENT", "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

   Description:  This property specifies a color that clients MAY use
      when presenting the relevant data to a user.  Typically this would
      appear as the "background" color of events or tasks.  The value is
      a case-insensitive color name taken from the CSS3 set of names,
      defined in Section 4.3 of [W3C.REC-css3-color-20110607].

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   color          = "COLOR" colorparam ":" text CRLF
                     ; Value is CSS3 color name

   colorparam     = *(";" other-param)

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

   COLOR:turquoise

5.10.  IMAGE Property

   Property Name:  IMAGE

   Purpose:  This property specifies an image associated with the
      calendar or a calendar component.

   Value Type:  URI or BINARY - no default.  The value MUST refer to or
      be data with a media type of "image".

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, display, inline encoding,
      and value data type property parameters can be specified on this
      property.  The format type parameter can be specified on this
      property and is RECOMMENDED for inline binary encoded content
      information.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in an
      iCalendar object, or "VEVENT", "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar
      components.

   Description:  This property specifies an image for an iCalendar
      object or a calendar component via a uri or directly with inline
      data that can be used by calendar user agents when presenting the
      calendar data to a user.  Multiple properties MAY be used to
      specify alternative sets of images with, for example, varying
      media subtypes, resolutions or sizes.  When multiple properties
      are present, calendar user agents SHOULD display only one of them,
      picking one that provides the most appropriate image quality, or
      display none.  The "DISPLAY" parameter is used to indicate the
      intended display mode for the image.  The "ALTREP" parameter,
      defined in [RFC5545], can be used to provide a "clickable" image
      where the URI in the parameter value can be "launched" by a click
      on the image in the calendar user agent.

5.11.  CONFERENCE Property

   Property Name:  CONFERENCE

   Purpose:  This property specifies information for accessing a
      conferencing system.

   Value Type:  URI - no default.

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, feature, and label property
      parameters can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times in a
      "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component.

   Description:  This property specifies information for accessing a
      conferencing system for attendees of a meeting or task.  This
      might be for a telephone-based conference number dial-in with
      access codes included (such as a tel: URI [RFC3966] or a sip: or
      sips: URI [RFC3261]), or it might be for a web-based video chat
      (such as an http: or https: URI [RFC7230]), or a URI for an
      instant messaging group chat room (such as an xmpp: URI
      [RFC5122]).  If a specific URI for a conferencing system is not
      available, a data: URI [RFC2397] containing a text description can
      be used.

      A conference system can be a bi-directional communication channel,
      or a uni-directional "broadcast feed".

      The "FEATURE" property parameter is used to describe the key
      capabilities of the conference system to allow a client to choose
      the ones that give the required level of interaction from a set of
      multiple properties.

      The "LABEL" property paramater is used to convey additional
      details on the use of the URI.  For example, the URIs or access
      codes for the moderator and attendee of a teleconference system
      could be different, and the "LABEL" property parameter could be
      used to "tag" each "CONFERENCE" property to indicate which is
      which.

      The "LANGUAGE" property parameter can be used to specify the
      language used for text values used with this property (as per
      Section 3.2.10 of [RFC5545].

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

6.  Property Parameters

6.1.  DISPLAY Property Parameter

   Parameter Name:  DISPLAY

   Purpose:  To specify different ways in which an image for a calendar
      or component can be displayed.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

   displayparam = "DISPLAY" "=" displayval *("," displayval)

   displayval =  ("BADGE" /     ; image inline with the title of the
                                ; event
                  "GRAPHIC" /   ; a full image replacement for the event

                  "FULLSIZE" /  ; an image that is used to enhance the
                                ; event
                  "THUMBNAIL" / ; a smaller variant of "FULLSIZE" to be
                                ; used when space for the image is
                                ; constrained
                  x-name /      ; Experimental type
                  iana-token)   ; Other IANA registered type
                                ;
                                ; Default is BADGE

   Description:  This property parameter MAY be specified on "IMAGE"
      properties.  In the absence of this parameter, the default value
      "BADGE" MUST be used.  The value determines how a client ought to
      present an image supplied in iCalendar data to the user.

      Values for this parameter are registered with IANA as per
      Section 9.3.1.  New values can be added to this registry following
      the procedure outlined in Section 8.2.1 of [RFC5545].

      Servers and clients MUST handle x-name and iana-token values they
      don't recognize by not displaying any image at all.

   Example:

   IMAGE;VALUE=URI;DISPLAY=BADGE,THUMBNAIL;FMTTYPE=image/png:https://exa
    mple.com/images/weather-cloudy.png

6.2.  EMAIL Property Parameter

   Parameter Name:  EMAIL

   Purpose:  To specify an email address that is used to identify or
      contact an organizer or attendee.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

   emailparam = "EMAIL" "=" param-value

   Description:  This property parameter MAY be specified on "ORGANIZER"
      or "ATTENDEE" properties.  This property can be used in situations
      where the calendar user address value of "ORGANIZER" and

      "ATTENDEE" properties is not likely to be an identifier that
      recipients of scheduling messages could use to match the calendar
      user with, for example, an address book entry.  The value of this
      property is an email address that can easily be matched by
      recipients.  Recipients can also use this value as an alternative
      means of contacting the calendar user via email.  If a recipient's
      calendar user agent allows the recipient to save contact
      information based on the "ORGANIZER" or "ATTENDEE" properties,
      those calendar user agents SHOULD use any "EMAIL" property
      parameter value for the email address of the contact over any
      mailto: calendar user address specified as the value of the
      property.  Calendar user agents SHOULD NOT include an "EMAIL"
      property parameter when its value matches the calendar user
      address specified as the value of the property.

   Example:

   ATTENDEE;CN=Cyrus Daboo;EMAIL=cyrus@example.com:mailto:opaque-toke
    n-1234@example.com

6.3.  FEATURE Property Parameter

   Parameter Name:  FEATURE

   Purpose:  To specify a feature or features of a conference or
      broadcast system.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

   featureparam = "FEATURE" "=" featuretext *("," featuretext)
   featuretext  =  ("AUDIO" /     ; Audio capability
                    "CHAT" /      ; Chat or instant messaging
                    "FEED" /      ; Blog or Atom feed
                    "MODERATOR" / ; Moderator dial-in code
                    "PHONE" /     ; Phone conference
                    "SCREEN" /    ; Screen sharing
                    "VIDEO" /     ; Video capability
                    x-name /      ; Experimental type
                    iana-token)   ; Other IANA registered type

   Description:  This property parameter MAY be specified on the
      "CONFERENCE" property.  Multiple values can be specified.  The
      "MODERATOR" value is used to indicate that the property value is
      specific to the owner/initiator of the conference and contains a
      URI that "activates" the system (e.g., a "moderator" access code
      for a phone conference system that is different from the "regular"
      access code).

    event
   CONFERENCE;VALUE=URI;FEATURE=AUDIO,VIDEO:https://video-chat.exam
    ple.com/;group-id=1234

6.4.  LABEL Property Parameter

   Parameter Name:  LABEL

   Purpose:  To provide a human readable label.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

   labelparam = "LABEL" "=" param-value

   Description:  This property parameter MAY be specified on the
      "CONFERENCE" property.  It is anticipated that other extensions to
      iCalendar will re-use this property parameter on new properties
      that they define.  As a result, clients MUST expect to find this
      property parameter present on many different properties.  It
      provides a human readable label that can be presented to calendar
      users to allow them to discriminate between properties which might
      be similar, or provide additional information for properties that
      are not self-describing.  The "LANGUAGE" property parameter can be
      used to specify the language of the text in the parameter value
      (as per Section 3.2.10 of [RFC5545].

   Example:

   CONFERENCE;VALUE=URI;FEATURE=VIDEO;
    LABEL="Web video chat, access code=76543";
    :https://video-chat.example.com/;group-id=1234

7.  Security Considerations

   Several of the new properties or parameters defined by this
   specification allow reference to "external" URIs.  Care MUST be taken
   when accessing data at external URIs as malicious content could be
   present.  Clients SHOULD ensure that suitable permission is granted
   by calendar users before such URIs are dereferenced.

   The "REFRESH-INTERVAL" property could be used by an attacker to make
   a client carry out rapid requests to the server hosting the calendar,
   by specifying a very short duration (e.g., one second).  This could
   lead to resource consumption on the client or server, and denial-of-



Daboo                   Expires February 23, 2017              [Page 17]

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions          August 2016


   service attacks against the server.  Clients MUST ensure that they
   throttle requests to the server to a reasonable rate.  In most cases,
   updating a public calendar once per day would suffice.  If the
   "REFRESH-INTERVAL" is any less than that, clients SHOULD warn the
   calendar user and allow them to override it with a longer value.

   The "CONFERENCE" property can include a "FEATURE" property parameter
   with a "MODERATOR" value.  In some cases the access code used by the
   owner/initiator of a conference might be private to an individual and
   clients and servers MUST ensure that such properties are not sent to
   attendees of a scheduled component, or sharees of a shared component.

   Both the "COLOR" and "IMAGE" properties are likely to be used by
   calendar users to express their own personal view of the calendar
   data.  In addition, these properties could be used by attackers to
   produce a confusing display in a calendar user agent.  When such
   properties are encountered in calendar data that has come from other
   calendar users (e.g., via a scheduling message, "public" calendar
   subscription, shared calendar etc), it is advisable for the client to
   give the receiving calendar user the option to remove (or adjust)
   these properties as the data is imported into their calendar system.

   This specification changes the recommendations on how "UID" property
   values are constructed to minimize leaking any information that might
   be security sensitive.

   Security considerations in [RFC5545], and [RFC5546] MUST also be
   adhered to.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   Several of the new properties or parameters defined by this
   specification allow reference to "external" URIs.  Access to those
   URIs could be tracked, leading to loss of privacy.  Clients SHOULD
   ensure that suitable permission is granted by calendar users before
   such URIs are dereferenced.  In particular, calendar publishers
   wishing to help protect the privacy of their subscribers MUST use
   HTTP with Transport Layer Security [RFC7230] ("https:" URIs instead
   of "http:" URIs) for access to calendar data or ancillary data such
   as images.

   In general, users have to rely on the privacy policies of any
   conferencing system being accessed via the "CONFERENCE" property, for
   their own privacy protection.  It is entirely possible for such
   systems to uniquely identify and log the activity and participation
   (or not) of calendar users in the conference.  Calendar user agents
   SHOULD track which conferencing systems are used and warn users the
   first time a new one is about to be used.  This is particularly



Daboo                   Expires February 23, 2017              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions          August 2016


   important if the client automatically "dials in" to the conference
   when the event start time occurs.

   By giving different calendar users different values for the "REFRESH-
   INTERVAL" property, it is possible for a publisher of calendar data
   to uniquely identify each refresh from each calendar users' clients,
   and thereby track user activity and IP address over time.  To address
   this, clients SHOULD add or subtract some random amount of time from
   the published "REFRESH-INTERVAL" value when doing actual refreshes.

   This specification changes the recommendations on how "UID" property
   values are constructed to minimize leaking any information that might
   be privacy sensitive.

   Privacy considerations in [RFC5545], and [RFC5546] MUST also be
   adhered to.
