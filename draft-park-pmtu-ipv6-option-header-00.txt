  Abstract   

  This document presents a new method for the PMTU discovery for IPv6. 
  To discover the PMTU of a path, a source node measures its actual PMTU
  using the newly defined Hop-by-Hop Option header, whereas a source 
  node initially assumes that the PMTU of a path is the known MTU of 
  the first hop in the path in the previous one [1981]. In order to 
  measure the actual PMTU, the source node sends the IP packet with the
  newly defined Hop-by-Hop Option header to the destination node with 
  the first data packet when node is beginning. This can eliminate the 
  chance of occurrence of several iterations of the somewhat complex 
  discovery cycle (sending a packet, receiving a Packet Too Big message,
  reducing a packet size). Most of all, since existing PMTU has a weak 
  point for security and denial-of-service attacks, this document 
  suggests a security function when PMTU is going on.
  
  All IPv6 nodes, including both hosts and routers, must implement newly
  Options as defined in this specification.

  1.  Introduction

  The discovery of the Path MTU (PMTU) is described in [1981]. The basic 
  idea of [1981] is that a source node initially assumes that the a 
  path's PMTU is the known MTU of the first hop in the path. If any of 
  the packets sent on that path are too large to be forwarded by some 
  node along the path, that node will discard them and return ICMPv6 
  Packet Too Big messages [2463]. Upon receipt of such a message, the 
  source node reduces its assumed PMTU for the path based on the MTU of 
  the constricting hop as reported in the Packet Too Big message. The 
  PMTU Discovery process ends when packets arrive at the destination 
  node.
           
  However, in [1981], there may be several iterations of the somewhat 
  complex discovery cycle (sending a packet, receiving a Packet Too Big 
  message, reducing a packet size), before the actual PMTU is obtained.
  In the worst case, the number of interactions becomes the number of 
  hops in the path. This method might be somewhat inefficient. 
       
  Therefore, a new method for the PMTU discovery is suggested in this 
  document. In this new method, to discover the PMTU of a path, the 
  source node measures its actual PMTU using the newly defined 
  Hop-by-Hop Option header. To measure the actual PMTU, the source node
  sends the IP packet with the newly defined Hop-by-Hop Option header 
  to the destination node with the first data packet which should be the
  its link MTU when node is beginning. After then, the measured PMTU is 
  used to send the subsequent packets.

  Now, another problem can be considered in PMTU Discovery [1981]. Due 
  to changes in the routing topology, the PMTU of a path may change over 
  time. In [1981], to detect increases of the PMTU of a path, the source
  node periodically increases its assumed PMTU although this is done 
  infrequently (10 minutes in general). However, in this method, the 
  assumed PMTU is increased by the source node's link MTU 
  unconditionally. This may also result in several iterations of the 
  discovery cycle. This problem can be also resolved by the proposed 
  method.
                 
  Therefore, in both discovering PMTU and detecting PMTU's increases, 
  the proposed method can eliminate the chance of occurrence of several
  iterations of the somewhat complex discovery cycle. Thus, the proposed 
  method in this document can be helpful for the best-conditioned 
  network environment because the actual PMTU is measured dynamically 
  for changes in the routing topology.
  
  Finally, existing PMTU [1981] mechanism makes possible some denial-of-
  service attacks, most of all, both are based on a malicious party 
  sending false Packet Too Big messages to a victim. Accordingly both 
  weak points, it will result in suboptimal performance and availability
  of denial-of-service attacks. This document suggests the secure PMTU 
  method. It is described in section 7.

    
  2.  Terminology
    
 	o PMTU			is the minimum link MTU of all the links
    				in a path between a source node and a
    				destination node.
    				
    	o MTU			is stands for Maximum Transmission Unit.
    				i.e., maximum packet size in octets, 
    				that can be conveyed in one piece over
    				a link.
    
    	o Detection Timer	Nodes may send PMTU packet at infrequent
    				intervals in order to detect an increase.
    				The recommended setting for this timer
    				is same value as [1981]. (10 minutes)
    				
    	o Response Timer	If the source node does not receive the
    				packet with Response MAP Option until
    				the Response Timer expires, the source
    				node initially assumes that the PMTU
    				of a path is the MTU of the first hop
    				in the path as [1981].			
    	
    	o MAP			is stands for Measuring Actual PMTU. In 
    				order to perform MAP, newly MAP Option 
    				must be done.
    				
    	o Discoverying PMTU	When node is beginning, node should 
    				perform PMTU to discovery its own value.

  3.  Proposed Method : Overview

  This section gives a brief overview of the new method for the 
  discoverying and detecting PMTU mechanisms.
    
  A router on routing path examines only IP header, Hop-by-Hop Option
  header and routing header in extension header. Other extension headers
  and data are examined only by a source node and destination node. 
  In the new method, Hop-by-Hop Option header is used to measure 
  increases in a path's PMTU

  The Hop-by-Hop Option header and Option is defined as below.

  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

  |                                                               |
  .                                                               .
  .                            Options                            .
  .                                                               .
  |                                                               |

  Currently, Hop-by-Hop Option headers are Pad1, PadN, Jumbo Payload, 
  and Router Alert Options.  This document defines a new Option. It is
  called 'Measuring Actual PMTU (MAP Option)'. Then, the IP packet 
  including Hop-by-Hop Option header with MAP Option has the following
  format.

  Option Data(PMTU)    Measured PMTU value with 4 bytes

                 <Figure 2 IP Packet with MAP Option>


  The Option Type identifiers are internally encoded such that their
  highest-order two bits specify the action that must be taken when 
  the router does not recognize the Option Type. The third highest 
  order bit of the Option Type specifies whether or not the Option 
  Data (PMTU) of that Option can change en-route to the packet's 
  final destination. The other five bits are defined arbitrarily. 
  The MAP Option has two Option Types. The one is Request MAP Option
  and the other is Response MAP Option, which will be shown in 
  following subsections. If any of the routers en-route cannot 
  recognize the Option Types, it skips over or discards the packet 
  silently. It depends on operator policy.
  
	o The highest-order two bits of the Option type is 00
		If routers are not understand MAP Options, this packet
		must be skipped over this Option and continue processing
		the header. When this Option meets with possible router,
		this PMTU must be modified. When source node receives
		this response, it is not actual PMTU because all routers
		are not understand. If received MTU is larger than its
		own value, this MTU should be ignored.
		Note : In initiation case, node must use "00" value 
		because of response error message 
		(Packet Too Big message). 	
  	
  	o The highest-order two bits of the Option type is 01
		If routers are not understand MAP Options, this packet
		must be discarded, at this case, source node has its 
		waiting time. When this time is expired without any 
		response, this node should perform original PMTU as 
		[1981].

  This document suggests that if specific link should be performed with 
  small PMTU value, at this point, MAP Options should be applied. 
  
  
    
  3.1  Request MAP Option Format

  The Request MAP Option format is defined to measure real PMTU as 
  shown in Figure 3. The source node sends the IP packet with this
  Request MAP Option format to the destination node.

  3.3  Discoverying PMTU with MAP Options

  The source node sends IP packet with Request MAP Option to the 
  destination node when node is beginning to communicate. Initial MTU 
  value should be its link MTU of the source node. After node receives 
  Response MAP Option with PMTU, the subsequent packets will be sent of
  course using obtained PMTU. If the first packet with the IPv6 minimum
  link MTU don't go through the next-hop, its node must not reduce its 
  estimate of the PMTU below the IPv6 minimum link MTU. At this case, 
  node may receive a Packet Too Big message reporting a next-hop MTU 
  that is less than IPv6 minimum link MTU. Then, node must include a 
  Fragment header in those packets. This packet should be composed of 
  the following headers:
  
  	IPv6 Header
  	Hop-by-Hop Options with Request/Response MAP Option
  	Fragment
  	...
    
  While the packet is passing through nodes en-route, the following 
  action occurs.

  - Compare PMTU in Request MAP Option and Link MTU of next hop. 
  - Store the smaller value between them on PMTU field of the packet.
      
  By doing the same action on routers en-route, PMTU field of the IP
  packet with Request MAP Option is updated to have minimum PMTU.
  This is the actual PMTU value. The destination node that receives 
  the IP packet returns back this value to the source node using 
  Response MAP Option. The source node that receives the actual PMTU 
  value determines the transmission length of a packet. However, if 
  all routers don't recognize MAP Options, responsed MTU is not actual
  PMTU.


  3.4  Detecting PMTU with MAP Options
     
  As described on Path MTU Discovery [1981], a source node sends IP 
  packet with Request MAP Option to a destination node before the 
  Detection Timer expires so that it wants to increase PMTU value. 
  Default MTU value is link MTU of the source node. This packet
  should be composed of the following headers:
  
  	IPv6 Header
  	Hop-by-Hop Options with Request/Response MAP Option

  INTERNET-DRAFT                                             March 2003
  	
  While the packet is passing through nodes en-route, the actions are
  the same as section 3.3
       
  By doing the same action on routers en-route, PMTU field of the IP
  packet with Response MAP Option is updated to have minimum PMTU.
  This is the optimal PMTU value. The destination node that receives 
  the IP packet returns back this value to the source node using 
  Response MAP Option. The source node that receives the optimal PMTU
  value determines the transmission length of a packet. This method can
  reduce the number of ICMP-Packet Too  Big Error message, otherwise 
  happens more frequently. This also reduce waste of network resource.
  
   
  4.  Node Requirements for Discoverying PMTU

  4.1  Source Node and Destination Node

  When the IPv6 source node has a large amount of packets to send to the 
  destination node, the source node sends the IP packet with Request MAP 
  Option to the destination when node is beginning. The PMTU field of 
  Request MAP Option of the packet initialized by the value of its link 
  MTU of the source node. If router does not understand the MAP Options, 
  the packet is skipped over this Option and continue processing the 
  header (See section 3.). When node receives the Packet Too Big message
  this node should be performed existing PMTU as [1981].

  Whenever the destination node receives the IP packet with Request MAP 
  Option, it must response the IP packet with Response MAP Option
  immediately. By the Option Type, this packet cannot be modified by 
  routers on routing path.
   
       
  4.2  Nodes on Routing Path

  Nodes on a routing path are routers. When the IP packet with Request 
  MAP Option arrives on these routers, they compare the PMTU in Request
  MAP Option and link MTU of the next hop. They select a smaller value 
  between them and forward the packet with a PMTU value. After doing 
  the same procedure, the final destination node comes to know minimum 
  PMTU. If the IP packet with Response MAP Option arrives on theses 
  routers, they forward the packet without any modification. If routers
  can not recognize two MAP Options, it skips over this Option and
  continue processing the header since the first two bits of the MAP
  Option is 00. (See section 3.).
    
    
  4.3  Operation Procedure

  When the IPv6 source node sends to the destination node, the source 
  node sends the IP packet with Request MAP Option and its link MTU of 
  the source node to a destination. In this case, the Option Type in 
  Request MAP Option is 112 (temporary  value). While the packet is

  en-route, intermediate routers compare the PMTU in Request MAP Option
  and link MTU of the next hop. They select a smaller value between 
  them, store the value to PMTU field of Request MAP Option and forward 
  the packet with the updated PMTU. PMTU of the packet arrived at the 
  destination node becomes minimum PMTU. The destination node sends the 
  IP packet Response MAP Option to inform the source node. In this case, 
  the Option Type in Request MAP Option is 88 (temporary value). After 
  then, the source node sends packets using new PMTU. If routers 
  implements only previous PMTU Discovery [1981] on routing path, in 
  this case the router can skip over this Option and continue processing
  the header. If node receives the Packet Too Big message, the source 
  node should be performed existing PMTU as [1981]. If node receives 
  Response MAP Option, the source node must compare with its own MTU 
  value. The source node selects a smaller value between them and store.    

  Therefore, in discovering PMTU, the proposed method can eliminate 
  the chance of occurrence of several iterations of the discovery 
  cycle.
   

  5.  Node Requirements for Detecting PMTU

  5.1  Source Node and Destination Node

  A source node does not change the PMTU value for some amount of time 
  after it comes to know PMTU based on PMTU Discovery [1981]. When the 
  source node wants to increase PMTU by the Detection Timer, it sends 
  the IP packet with MAP Options to a destination. The PMTU field of 
  MAP Options of the packet contains the value of link MTU of the 
  source node and the data. Whenever a destination node receives the 
  IP packet with Request MAP Option, it must response the IP packet 
  with Response MAP Option immediately. By the Option Type, this packet
  cannot be modified by routers on routing path. Also, it can use both
  type "00" and "01". It depends on operator policy. In order to use 
  type "01", source node must have its timer, Response Timer. 
      
 
  5.2  Nodes on Routing Path

  This processing is same as section 4.2 

    
  5.3  Operation Procedure

  When the source node wants to increase PMTU by the Detection Timer,
  it sends the IP packet with Request MAP Option to a destination.
  In this case, the Option Type in Request MAP Option is 112 (temporary
  value). While the packet is en-route, intermediate routers compare the 
  PMTU in MAP Option and link MTU of the next hop. They select a smaller 
  value between them, store the value to PMTU field of MAP Option and 
  forward the packet with the updated PMTU. PMTU of the packet arrived 
  at the destination node becomes  minimum PMTU. The destination node 
  sends the IP packet Response MAP Option to inform the source node. In

  this case, the Option Type in Response MAP Option is 88 (temporary 
  value). After then, the source node sends packets using new PMTU.if 
  routers implements only previous PMTU Discovery [1981] on routing 
  path, in this case the router can silently discard the packet 
  without response error message by the highest-order two bits, 01, 
  in Option Type field or skip over this Option and continue processing 
  the header with MAP Options by the highest-order two bits, 00, in 
  Option Type field. If the source node does not receive the IP packet 
  with Response MAP Option until the Response Timer expires, the source
  node initially assumes that the PMTU of a path is the MTU of the first
  hop in the path as [1981].
    
    
  6.  Comparison with [1981]
    
  This section should be discussed more detail.
     	   
    	o  In order to perform PMTU, [1981] uses ICMPv6, but MAP uses 
    	   only basic IPv6 protocol and extension header with newly 
    	   Option. We assure that it should be implemented very easy in 
    	   host and router as well.
    	   
    	o  In the aspect of implementation, all IPv6 nodes, including
    	   both hosts and routers, must implement newly Options as 
    	   defined in this specification.
    	   
    	o  As described in [1981], MAP should consider all 
    	   implementation issues.
    	   
    	   
  7.  Security Considerations
    
  As we knew, existing PMTU [1981] mechanism makes possible two denial
  -of-service attacks, most of all, both are based on a malicious 
  party sending false Packet Too Big messages to a victim.
  Accordingly both weak points, it will result in suboptimal 
  performance and availability of denial-of-service attacks.
    
  MAP mechanism is not likely to do denial-of-service attacks. However
  when malicious node sends false MAP response with its correct type,
  there are still simpler denial-of-service attacks available.
    
  This document considers the protection method from various attacks.
  In order to avoid spoofing or attacking with incorrect response, 
  MAP mechanisms can use the 64-bit Nonce field. Its value in a MAP
  Option is always copied from the corresponding Request MAP by the
  responder. This method is an Optional, therefore the usage of this 
  method depends on operator. However this document recommends this 
  method is implemented with MAP Options for the secure PMTU.

  The Nonce should be a random or good pseudo-random value to foil
  spoofed replied. An implementation which allows multiple independent
  processes to send MAP Option may use the Nonce value to deliver MAP 
  Option to the correct process. Nonetheless, such processes must 
  check the received Nonce and ignore extraneous response.
