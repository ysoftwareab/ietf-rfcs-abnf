Internet-Draft           IPoEth over IEEE 802.16              March 2007


1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.16 [IEEE802.16] defines a point-to-multipoint radio
   transmission system connecting a Base Station (BS) with multiple
   Subscriber Stations (SSs).  IEEE 802.16e [IEEE802.16e] amends the
   base specification with PHY and MAC functions for supporting mobile
   terminals while adopting the same data link principles also for
   mobile networking systems.

   This document describes the transmission of IPv4 as well as IPv6 over
   Ethernet in a network deploying the IEEE 802.16 cellular radio
   transmission technology.  The Ethernet on top of IEEE 802.16 is
   realized by bridging between the point-to-point radio links, which
   are provided by IEEE 802.16 between the base station and its
   associated subscriber stations.

   Due to the resource constraints of radio transmission systems and the
   particularities of the IEEE 802.16 MAC for the realization of
   Ethernet, the transmission of IP over Ethernet over IEEE 802.16 may
   considerably benefit by adding IP specific support functions in the
   Ethernet over IEEE 802.16 while maintaining full compatibility with
   standard IP over Ethernet behavior.


2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Terminology

   Access Router (AR):  An entity that performs an IP routing function
      to provide IP connectivity for Subscriber Stations.

   Base Station (BS):  A generalized equipment sets providing
      connectivity, management, and control of the subscriber station.

   Connection Identifier (CID):  A 16 bit value that identifies a
      connection to equivalent peers in the MAC of the base station and
      subscriber station.

   Subscriber Station (SS):  A generalized equipment set providing
      connectivity between subscriber equipment and a base station.
      Within this document the term SS also represents the Mobile
      Subscriber Station introduced in IEEE 802.16e

   Service-specific Convergence Sublayer (CS):  Sublayer in the IEEE
      802.16 MAC layer which classifies external network data and
      associates them to the proper MAC service flow identifier and
      connection identifier.


4.  The IEEE 802.16 Link Model

4.1.  Connection Oriented Air Interface

   The IEEE 802.16 MAC establishes multiple connections between a BS and
   its associated SSs for the transfer of user data over the air.  Each
   of these connections realize an individual Service Flow which is
   identified by a 16 bit CID number and has a defined QoS profile.

   Multiple connections can be established between a BS and a SS, each
   with its particular QoS class and direction.  Despite of the BS and
   all the SS are identified by unique 48bit MAC addresses, packets
   going over the air are only carrying the CID number of the particular
   connection.  The connections are established by MAC management
   messages between the BS and the SS during network entry or also later
   on demand.  Unique cryptographic keys are generated during the
   initial authentication phase between the BS and each of the
   associated SSs to protect the data transmission over the air.

   While uplink connections from the SSs to the BS provide only unicast
   transmission capabilities from, downlink connections can be used for
   unicast transmission from the BS to a single SS as well as for
   multicast transmissions to a group of SSs.

4.2.  Feeding User Data into the Appropriate Connections

   Assignment of higher layer packets to particular service flows and
   related CIDs is performed by the convergence sublayer within the IEEE
   802.16 MAC.  It classifies the packets depending on the values of a
   defined subset of the payload packet header fields and assigns the
   packets to the appropriate service flow.

   To enable the transmission of different kind of payloads over IEEE
   802.16, multiple convergence sublayers are defined, each specific for
   one kind of payload packet type, like Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6 or even
   for encapsulated payload, like IPv4 over Ethernet or IPv6 over
   Ethernet.

4.3.  MAC addressing in IEEE 802.16

   The 48-bit unique MAC address of a SS is used during the initial
   ranging process for the identification of a SS and is verified by the
   succeeding PKMv2 authentication phase.  Out of it, the BS establishes
   a list of MAC addresses of all SSs connected to the BS purely for MAC
   management purposes.

   While MAC addresses exist for all the SSs as well as the BS the
   transfer of packets over the air is performed based only on the CID
   value.  It enables the transport of arbitrary source and destination
   MAC addresses in Ethernet frames between a SS and its BS.  This can
   be leveraged when there are additional MAC addresses to the SS MAC
   address in the case that the SS acts as an Ethernet bridge for a
   network behind the SS.

   Due to the defined mapping of the CIDs to the MAC address of the
   associated SS, the BS is able to bundle all connections belonging to
   a particular SS to a single connection on the network side to realize
   a plain layer 2 forwarding behaviour in the BS.


5.  The IEEE 802.16 Network Model for Ethernet

5.1.  IEEE 802.16 Ethernet Link Model

   According to [RFC2461], an IP Link is defined as a communication
   facility or medium over which nodes can communicate at the link
   layer, i.e. the layer immediately below IP.  IEEE 802.16 provides
   point-to-point connections between SSs and the BS without enabling
   any direct SS to SS connectivity.

   Ethernet is realized over IEEE 802.16 by implementing bridging
   between all SSs with the IEEE 802.16 radio transmission system



Jeon, et al.            Expires September 5, 2007               [Page 6]

   providing the point-to-point connections between the hosts and the
   bridge behind the BS.  This is equivalent to today's switched
   Ethernet with twisted pair wires connecting the hosts to a bridge
   ("Switch") but in a IEEE 802.16 network the 'twisted pair wires' are
   usually implemented by per SS connections between the BS and a
   bridging function.  The bridge must be able to create a new port
   whenever a new SS attaches to any of the BSs of the network or to
   remove a port when an associated SS detaches from the network.

   The BS forwards all the service flow belonging to one SS to one radio
   side port of a bridge behind the BSs.  Not more than one SS should be
   connected to a port of the bridge.

   If the SS functions as a bridge for multiple hosts behind the SS
   (i.e.  SS#4 in the below figure) then it should support bridging
   according to [IEEE802.1D] supporting efforts of [IEEE802.16k] between
   all its LAN ports and the air link.

5.2.  Ethernet without Native Broadcast and Multicast Support

   Current IEEE 802.16 [IEEE802.16][IEEE802.16e] does not define any
   transport connection for IP broadcast and multicast data.  Also,
   Multicast and Broadcast Service (MBS, stated in 6.3.23 of
   [IEEE802.16e]) cannot be used for the IP broadcast or multicast data
   because MBS is invisible to IP layer.  Hence IP broadcast and

   multicast packets should be replicated and then carried via unicast
   transport connections as IEEE 802.16 access link.  Bridge does the
   replication.

5.3.  Segmenting the Ethernet into VLAN

   It is possible to restrict the size and coverage of an IP link by
   segmenting the Ethernet and grouping subsets of hosts into VLANs.
   Therefore, the bridge behind the BSs must be enabled to support VLANs
   according to [IEEE802.1Q] by assigning and handling the VLAN-IDs of
   the virtual bridge ports.

   If a SS itself contains a VLAN enabled bridge or is directly
   connected to a bridge supporting VLANs, the port associated with such
   a SS may be enabled as trunk port.  On trunk ports, Ethernet frames
   are forwarded in the [IEEE802.1Q] frame format.

5.4.  Deployment Scenarios for IP over Ethernet over IEEE 802.16

   Figure 3 and 4 show the deployment scenarios in case of IP over
   Ethernet over IEEE 802.16.  In both figures, an AR is connected to a
   bridge, which is connected to all BSs.  The bridge becomes an
   aggregation point for all the connections from SSs.  Multiple ARs can
   exist on a link, and an IP Link may consist of multiple hosts either
   being co-located with a SS or behind a SS connected a bridge.  The
   network behind a SS can support various access network technologies,
   e.g. 802.3, 802.11 or 802.15.

5.4.1.  Public Access Scenario

   Figure 3 depicts a public access scenario.  In the general public
   access case, direct communication between nodes is restricted because
   of security and accounting issues and the AR is connected to a
   network side port of the bridge behind the BSs.

   In this scenario, the bridge forwards all packets received from any
   radio side port to all network side ports being in the forwarding
   state.  Peer-to-peer communication is not supported by the bridge and
   all packets originated from a SS should be delivered to an AR.  The
   AR performs a security filtering, policing and accounting of all
   traffic from hosts, like a NAS (Network Access Server).

                     Figure 3. Public Access Scenario

   While the bridge forces all traffic from hosts to reach the AR, it
   still performs Learning Process and maintains Filtering Database as
   specified in [IEEE802.1D] and then forwards IP unicast packets from
   the AR based on the Filtering Database.  However, IP broadcast and
   multicast packets are treated with special rules for Broadcast Data
   Forwarding and Multicast Data Forwarding as stated in Section 6.1.

5.4.2.  Enterprise LAN Scenario

   The enterprise LAN scenario assumes trust relationship between all
   hosts and thus enables hosts to directly communicate each other
   without detouring.  Multiple AR may be connected to a link, and ARs
   may reside on both sides of the network, on the network side of the
   bridge behind the BSs as well as behind a SS connected to a bridge.
   Figure 4 depicts the enterprise LAN scenario network model.

   IP unicast packets from either SSs or AR are forwarded by
   [IEEE802.1D] based bridging, and IP broadcast and multicast packets
   are processed on the bridge according to the Broadcast Data
   Forwarding Rules and Multicast Data Forwarding Rules presented in

6.  Bridge Considerations

   This section discusses operations of the bridge behind the BSs

6.1.  Multicast and Broadcast Packet Processing

   All multicast and multicast control messages shall be processed in
   the bridge according to [RFC4541].  Broadcasting messages to all
   radio side ports of the bridge SHOULD be prevented.

   Further details on prevention of broadcasting messages to all radio
   side ports are given in the following sections.

6.1.1.  Multicast Transmission Considerations

   Bridge copies the IP multicast packets, like IP broadcast, and
   forwards into all its available ports, but an incoming port.  As a
   result, the IP multicast packets can be transmitted to SSs which do
   not participate in the corresponding multicast group.  This is why IP
   multicast membership should be propagated between bridges

   [RFC4541] describes Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and



Jeon, et al.            Expires September 5, 2007              [Page 10]

Internet-Draft           IPoEth over IEEE 802.16              March 2007


   Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) snooping switches.  The IGMP/MLD
   snooping switches examine IGMP/MLD report messages and creates a
   multicast address entry in its forwarding table.  Followings
   summarize two main processes of IGMP/MLD snooping switches (i.e.
   bridge).

   IGMP and MLD Forwarding Rules:  A snooping switch that creates a new
      multicast address entry in its forwarding table with received
      report messages forwards the report messages only to those ports
      where multicast routers are attached.  The multicast entry can be
      removed by receiving corresponding IGMP Leave Group/MLD Done
      messages or timeout mechanism.

   Multicast Data Forwarding Rules:  Packets with a destination IP
      address outside 224.0.0.0/24 in IPv4 or for IPv6 multicast address
      with scope 2 or greater except FF02::1 (link-local scope all-nodes
      multicast address) are forwarded according to the previously
      created forwarding table and also forwarded on multicast router
      ports.  An unregistered IP multicast packets that does not match
      any of entries in the forwarding table should be forwarded on
      ports where multicast routers are attached.

6.1.2.  Broadcast Transmission Considerations

   Bridge floods the IP broadcast packets out of all connected ports
   except that on which the packets was received.  This behaviour in not
   appropriate with scarce resources and dormant-mode hosts in a
   wireless network such as IEEE 802.16 based access network.  This
   document defines following forwarding rules on bridges for filtering
   the IP broadcast data.  Note that packets destined for permanently
   assigned multicast addresses such as 224.0.0.0/24 in IPv4 or FF02::1
   in IPv6 are regarded as broadcast data.

   Broadcast Data Forwarding Rules:  The bridge discards all IP
      broadcast packets except ARP, DHCP (DHCPv4 and DHCPv6), IGMP, and
      MLD related traffic.  The ARP, DHCP, IGMP and MLD related packets
      received on radio side are forwarded only towards access router,
      not another radio sides.  On the other hand, the allowed IP
      broadcast packets received on the network side are forwarded on
      all ports except their incoming port.

6.2.  Proxy ARP

   Proxy ARP provides a process where a device connecting between hosts
   answers ARP Requests instead of a remote host.  In this document, the
   Proxy ARP is used to force traffic from hosts to access router and
   avoid broadcasting ARP Requests over the air depending on the
   particular deployment scenario.  A bridge behind the BSs performs the

Internet-Draft           IPoEth over IEEE 802.16              March 2007


   Proxy ARP process.

6.2.1.  Public Access Scenario Case

   A bridge behind the BSs filters broadcast ARP Requests and responds
   to all the ARP Requests from radio side port with access router's
   Ethernet address so that all IPv4 packets from SSs are forwarded to
   the access router in the public access scenario.  Learning the IP and
   Ethernet address of the access router on bridge follows Section 3.1
   in [RFC4562].

6.2.2.  Enterprise LAN Scenario Case

   The bridge behind the BSs maintains an ARP Cache.  The ARP Cache has
   a sufficient size to accommodate ARP entries for all its serving SSs
   and is updated by any packets including ARP Requests from SSs like
   its Filtering Database.

   Upon receiving the ARP Requests from SSs, the bridge unicasts ARP
   Replies back to SSs with Ethernet address of target host provided
   that the target address matches an entry in the ARP Cache.
   Otherwise, the bridge floods the ARP Requests.  The bridge silently
   discard any received self-ARP Requests.


7.  Access Router Considerations

   In the public access scenario, all packets between SSs will always be
   relayed via access router.  In this situation, the access router may
   forward packets via same interface on which the access router
   received the packets.  This results in Redirect message from the
   access router [RFC0792][RFC2461].  Access router in the public access
   scenario disables above the Redirect function on the interface to
   which SSs attach.


8.  Prefix Assignment

8.1.  IPv4 over Ethernet

   All SSs under the same AR share a single subnet prefix.  Sharing the
   prefix means locating all SSs on the same subnet and it benefits from
   high address assignment efficiency when concerning scarce IPv4
   address space.  The prefix can be manually configured or
   automatically with subnet mask option in DHCPv4 [RFC2132].

Internet-Draft           IPoEth over IEEE 802.16              March 2007


8.2.  IPv6 over Ethernet

   In the enterprise LAN scenario, a single subnet prefix has an
   advantage over multiple subnet prefixes in simplifying management.
   However, assignment of unique prefix per SS can be considered in the
   public access scenario because it forces all packets from SSs to be
   transferred to an access router.

   Access router assigns IPv6 prefixes with Prefix Information option as
   specified in [RFC2461].


9.  Transmission of IP over Ethernet

9.1.  IPv4 over Ethernet

   [RFC0894] defines the transmission of IPv4 packets over Ethernet
   networks.  It contains the specification of the encapsulation of the
   IPv4 packets into Ethernet frames as well as rules for mapping of IP
   addresses onto Ethernet MAC addresses.  This document follows the
   operations specified in [RFC0894].

9.1.1.  Address Configuration

   IPv4 addresses are configured manually or assigned dynamically from
   DHCPv4 server [RFC2131].

   DHCP clients may send DHCP DISCOVER and DHCP REQUEST messages with
   the BROADCAST bit set to request the DHCP server to broadcast its
   DHCP OFFER and DHCP ACK messages.  The bridge filters these broadcast
   DHCP OFFER and DHCP ACK messages and forwards the broadcast messages
   only to the host defined by the client hardware address in the chaddr
   information element.

   Alternatively, the DHCP Relay Agent Information Option (option-82)
   [RFC3046] may be used to avoid DHCP broadcast replies.  The option-82
   consists of two type of sub-options; Circuit ID and Remote ID.  DHCP
   Relay Agent is located on bridges as Layer 2 DHCP Relay Agent in
   [TR101].  Bridge port number is possible as Circuit ID and Remote ID
   may be left unspecified.  Note that using option-82 has a requirement
   that DHCP servers should be aware of the option-82.

9.1.2.  Address Resolution

   SSs use Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) [RFC0826] for finding a
   destination's Ethernet MAC address.

Internet-Draft           IPoEth over IEEE 802.16              March 2007


9.2.  IPv6 over Ethernet

   [RFC2464] defines transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet
   Networks.  Encapsulation of IPv6 packets into Ethernet frames and
   mapping rules for IPv6 address to Ethernet address (i.e.  MAC
   address) follow [RFC2464].

9.2.1.  Router Discovery, Prefix Discovery and Parameter Discovery

   Router Discovery, Prefix Discovery and Parameter Discovery procedures
   are achieved by receiving Router Advertisement messages.  In this
   document, SSs perform above the discovery process by solicited Router
   Advertisement messages because periodic Router Advertisement messages
   are discarded on the bridges following the Broadcast Data Forwarding
   Rules in Section 6.1.2.

9.2.2.  Address Configuration

9.2.2.1.  Stateful Address Autoconfiguration

   When the'M' flag in the received RA is set, a SS should perform
   stateful address configuration according to [RFC3315].  In this case,
   an AR supports DHCPv6 server or relay function.

9.2.2.2.  Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

   The global IPv6 addresses are derived based on prefix and EUI-64-
   derived interface identifier and then confirmed through Duplicate
   Address Detection (DAD) as specified in [RFC2462].

9.2.3.  Address Resolution

   SS sends Neighbor Solicitation destined for solicited-node address
   corresponding to the target address in order to determine MAC address
   of a neighbor and then resolves the MAC address by receiving Neighbor
   Advertisement as specified in [RFC2461].

9.3.  Maximum Transmission Unit Consideration

   [RFC2460] requires that link layer support a minimum Maximum
   Transmission Unit (MTU) size of 1280 bytes and recommends the MTU of
   at least 1500 bytes be configured for IPv6 over Ethernet
   transmission.  [RFC0894] also specifies 1500 bytes as a maximum
   length of IPv4 over Ethernet.  Therefore, IEEE 802.16 frame should
   carry a payload size of 1518 bytes including the Ethernet header size
   of 18 bytes or 1522 bytes including additional VLAN tag size of 4
   bytes if present.

Internet-Draft           IPoEth over IEEE 802.16              March 2007


   The Length field in IEEE 802.16 MAC header has a size of 11 bits and
   indicates length in bytes of the MAC PDU including CRC and MAC
   header.  Hence PDU size is up to 2048 bytes and the maximum size of
   payload is 2038 bytes by subtracting size of CRC and MAC header from
   2048 bytes.  The maximum size of payload is sufficient to carry IPv4
   over Ethernet or IPv6 over Ethernet and thus the MTU of IPv4 and IPv6
   is the same as specified in [RFC0894] and [RFC2460] respectively.


10.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new vulnerability to operations of
   IPv4 over Ethernet and IPv6 over Ethernet.  [RFC3971] can be adopted
   for securing neighbor discovery processes.
