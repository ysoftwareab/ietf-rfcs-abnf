Abstract 
    
   This document defines a use case as well as a proposal for a parallel 
   namespace to "e164.arpa" as defined in RFC3761, to be used for 
   Infrastructure ENUM purposes.

1. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC-2119 [5]. 
    
2. Introduction 
    
   ENUM (E.164 Number Mapping, RFC 3761 [1]) is a system that transforms 
   E.164 numbers [2] into domain names and then uses the DNS (Domain 
   Name Service) [3] to discover NAPTR records that specify what 
   services are available for a specific domain name. 
 
   ENUM as originally defined was based on the end-user opt-in 
   principle.  While this has great potential to foster new services and 
   end-user choice in the long-term, the current requirements for IP-
   based interconnection of Voice over IP (VoIP) domains require the 
   provisioning of all allocated or served (hosted) numbers of a 
   participating service provider, without the need for individual users 
   to opt-in or not.  This is particularly important if Infrastructure 
   ENUM is used for number portability applications, for example.   
    
   In addition, while it is possible that service providers could 
   mandate that their users opt-in into e164.arpa through end-user 
   contract terms and conditions, there are substantial downsides to 
   such an approach.  Thus, for all these reasons and many others, ENUM 
   for end-user provisioning is ill-suited for use by service providers 
   for the interconnection of VoIP domains. 
    
   As VoIP evolves and becomes pervasive, E.164-addressed telephone 
   calls need not necessarily traverse the Public Switched Telephone 
   Network (PSTN).  Therefore, VoIP service providers have an interest

   in using ENUM, on a so-called "Infrastructure" basis, to keep VoIP 
   traffic on IP networks on an end-to-end basis, both within and 
   between service provider domains.  
    
   The requirements for Infrastructure ENUM are provided in an ENUM 
   Working Group document, Infrastructure ENUM Requirements [4].  This 
   document defines that Infrastructure ENUM be implemented by means of 
   a parallel namespace to e164.arpa dedicated to Infrastructure ENUM, 
   in a domain which is to be determined. 
   
   Infrastructure ENUM Tier 2 resource records in the Infrastructure 
   ENUM tree would be controlled by the service provider that is 
   providing services to a given E.164 number, generally referred to in 
   various nations as the "carrier of record".  The definition of who 
   controls a given E.164 number is a national matter or is defined by 
   the entity controlling the numbering space.  
 
3. Zone Apex for Infrastructure ENUM 
 
   The domain name chosen for infrastructure ENUM and any parent domains 
   MUST be hosted on name servers that have performance characteristics 
   and supporting infrastructure which is comparable to those deployed 
   for the Internet root name servers.  Those name servers for 
   Infrastructure ENUM should be configured and operated according to 
   the guidelines described in RFC 2870 [6].  
 
4. IANA Considerations 
 
   IANA has created a registry for Enumservices as originally specified 
   in RFC 2916 and revised in RFC 3761.  Enumservices registered with 
   IANA are valid for Infrastructure ENUM as well as end-user ENUM. 
    
5. Security and Privacy Considerations 
    
   Since Infrastructure ENUM is also implemented on the public Internet, 
   the same security considerations apply as noted in RFC 3761. 
     
   In addition, since there is no opt-in for end-users, personally-
   identifiable information (PII) must not be disclosed for any end-
   user.  
    
   Thus, the information provided in the NAPTR records must not disclose 
   any PII about the end-user such as a name in user-info. This can be 
   achieved, for example, by entering the information in the format 
   sip:<e164_phone_number>@provider.example.net,  
   mailto:<e164_phone_number>@provider.example.net or sip:<opaque 
   string>@provider.example.net.
