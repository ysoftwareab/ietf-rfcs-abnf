Abstract

   The IEEE 802.1X protocol provides authenticated layer 2 network
   access.  As part of the authentication for 802.1X, a device such as a
   switch or a wireless LAN access point can receive credentials from
   the authentication authority identifying the user of a device
   requesting access.  These credentials can then be used by a DHCP
   server in the selection of an IP address for assignment to the device
   through its DHCP client.  The 802.1X Credentials sub-option allows an
   access device that implements 802.1X and that can create DHCP Relay
   Agent options to pass along credentials for the user of a device
   received during 802.1X authentication to a DHCP server.

Internet-Draft        802.1X Credentials Sub-Option             Nov 2001


1. Introduction and Background

   The 802.1X Credentials sub-option for the DHCP Relay Agent option
   provides a way through which network elements can pass information
   obtained through IEEE 802.1X [2] layer-2 authentication to a DHCP
   server.  IEEE 802.1X is a mechanism through which a device such as a
   switch or a wireless LAN access point can authenticate the identity
   of the user of a device before providing layer 2 network access.  In
   802.1X authenticated access, a device must first exchange some
   authentication credentials with the network access device.  The
   access device then supplies these credentials to an authentication
   server, which either confirms or denies the identity of the user of
   the device requesting network access.  The access device, based on
   the reply of the authentication server, then allows or denies network
   access to the requesting device.

   Figure 1 summarizes the message exchange among the participants in
   IEEE 802.1X authentication.

Internet-Draft        802.1X Credentials Sub-Option             Nov 2001


   In the application described in this document, the access device acts
   as an 802.1X authenticator and adds DHCP relay agent options to DHCP
   messages.  During 802.1X authentication, the reply message from the
   authentication server carries additional identification information
   or credentials to the access device.  The access device stores these
   credentials locally.  When the access device subsequently forwards
   DHCP messages from the network device, the access device adds the
   identification information in an 802.1X Credentials sub-option.  The
   802.1X Credentials sub-option is another suboption of the Relay Agent
   option [5].

2. Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2.1 General Terminology

   Authentication server      Provides a service that confirms the
      identity of a network entity; e.g., a RADIUS [3] server

   Authentication credentials Data provided by a device to authenticate
      its identity

   Identity credentials       Data from the authentication server that
      can be used to identify an authenticated device


2.2 DHCP Terminology

   The following terms are used in conjunction with DHCP [4].

   DHCP relay agent           Forwards DHCP messages between DHCP
      clients and servers

   DHCP server                Provides configuration parameters to
      clients through DHCP messages

   DHCP client                Requests configuration parameters from
      servers through DHCP messages

   Relay agent option         A DHCP message option used by DHCP relay
      agents to pass information to DHCP servers [5]

2.3 802.1X Terminology

   The following terms are used in conjunction with the IEEE 802.1X
   protocol.

   Authenticator         Confirms the identity of the supplicant and
      controls the access of the supplicant to the network

   Supplicant            A device attempting to obtain network service
      through the authenticator


3. 802.1X Credentials sub-option format

   The 802.1X Credentials Sub-option is a new sub-option for the DHCP
   Relay Agent option.

    The format of the 802.1X Credentials sub-option is:

        SubOpt   Len     802.1X Information
         code
       +-------+-----+------+------+------+------+--...-+------+
       |  TBD  |  N  |  b1  |  b2  |  b3  |  b4  |      |  bN  |
       +-------+-----+------+------+------+------+--...-+------+

   The 802.1X credentials are carried as opaque data bytes b1...bN.

4. Client Behavior

   To enable the use of the 802.1X Credentials sub-option, the host must
   use both 802.1X and DHCP.  The host need not make any other special
   provision for the use of the 802.1X Credentials sub-option.

5. DHCP Relay Agent Behavior

   When the DHCP relay agent receives a DHCP message from the client, it
   MAY append a DHCP Relay Agent option containing the 802.1X
   Credentials sub-option, along with any other relay agent sub-options
   it is configured to supply.  The 802.1X Credentials sub-option MUST
   contain the credentials from the 802.1X authentication service.  The
   DHCP relay agent MUST NOT add 802.1X Credentials sub-options beyond
   one in a message.

   The specification of the mechanism through which the authentication
   service supplies the credentials to the 802.1X authenticator is
   beyond the scope of this document.  The 802.1X Credentials sub-option
   may be used for any credentials supplied to the authenticator through
   whatever protocol used to communicate with the authentication

   service.

6. Server Behavior

   When the DHCP server receives a message from an relay agent
   containing an 802.1X Credentials sub-option, it extracts the contents
   of the of the sub-option and uses that information in selecting
   configuration parameters for the client.

7. Security Considerations

   DHCP as currently defined provides no authentication or security
   mechanisms.  Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7
   of the DHCP protocol specification in RFC 2131.

   The DHCP Relay Agent option depends on a trusted relationship between
   the DHCP relay agent and the server, as described in section 5 of RFC
   3046.  Because the 802.1X credentials are not encrypted or protected
   against modification in any way, the contents can be spoofed or
   modifed by hostile devices in an unsecured network.

8. IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the value of TBD for the DHCP Relay Agent
   Information option sub-option code for this sub-option.  This
   document does not define any new namespaces or other constants for
   which IANA must maintain a registry.

9. Terms of Use

   Cisco has a pending patent which relates to the subject matter of
   this Internet Draft.  If a standard relating to this subject matter
   is adopted by IETF and any claims of any issued Cisco patents are
   necessary for practicing this standard, any party will be able to
   obtain a license from Cisco to use any such patent claims under
   openly specified, reasonable, non-discriminatory terms to implement
   and fully comply with the standard.
