Abstract

   This document discusses AP selection method utilizing the number of 
   frame retransmissions in addition to received signal strength (RSSI).
   In a real environment, WLANs are congested by lots of mobile nodes,
   and sometimes influenced by other WLAN devices. They result in 
   deterioration of communication quality. In such environment, 
   each mobile node has to select an AP with better performance for 
   keeping its own communication stable. To enable this, we employ 
   the number of frame retransmissions and RSSI as selection indexes.
   We then describe an architecture design and implementation for our
   proposed scheme.

1. Introduction

   Wireless LANs (WLANs) based on the IEEE 802.11 specification [1] 
   provide high data transmission and simple, low-cost installation. 
   For this reason, WLANs have been spreading rapidly in both private 
   and public spaces, so that these WLANs will overlap to provide 
   continuous and wide coverage as the underlying basis of ubiquitous 
   networks. In such ubiquitous WLANs, mobile nodes (MNs) can access 
   the Internet from everywhere and at anytime. 

   In WLANs, an MN requires not only permanent access to the Internet, 
   but also seamless movement between access points (APs) without 
   degradation of communication quality, i.e., seamless mobility is 
   essential. Furthermore, in such ubiquitous WLANs, each AP will 
   independently provide wireless Internet connectivity based on 
   IEEE 802.11 technology. That is, the WLAN coverage consists of 
   different IP subnets due to independent management by different 
   organizations and operators. In such a situation, even if a mobility 
   support technology applying to AP is developed and standardized,
   from now on, it will be difficult to replace all APs, which have been
   spreading, with new APs that support mobility technology. Moreover, 
   since existing APs may not be able to accept such technologies 
   due to restrictions such as lower CPU performance or less memory, 
   update of APs' software for supporting mobility technology is also 
   not realistic. Therefore, it is desirable to provide a seamless 
   mobility technology without modification of APs.

   To achieve such seamless mobility, the following two requirements 
   must be satisfied: (1) selection of an AP with better performance 
   from among multiple candidate APs and (2) preservation of 
   communication quality during handover. For (2), we proposed 
   a handover management scheme based on the number of frame 
   retransmissions [2-4]. In the proposed scheme, an MN is assumed to 
   move between WLANs with different IP subnets. In [2], we first 
   employed multi-homing architecture to prevent a disruption period 
   due to handover processes. That is, since an MN with two WLAN 
   interfaces (a multi-homing MN) can connect to two APs simultaneously
   before starting handover, an MN never experiences a disruption 
   period due to handover processes. Next, to properly switch the two 
   associating APs based on each wireless link quality, the number of 
   frame retransmissions was introduced as an indicator for detecting 
   the wireless link condition. Although the Received Signal Strength 
   Indicator (RSSI) is generally used as an indicator of a wireless 
   link quality, we showed that the RSSI is insufficient to detect 
   wireless link condition precisely because it is incapable of 
   detecting the degradation of communication quality due to radio 
   interference [5].  On the other hand, we showed that the number of 
   frame retransmissions could promptly and reliably detect 
   the performance degradation due to reduction of the RSSI and radio 
   interference. Therefore, the proposed handover management method 
   based on the number of frame retransmissions can preserve 
   communication quality during a handover.

   Selection of an AP with better performance from among multiple 
   candidate APs, however, remains unresolved. For example, in the 
   method proposed in [2], even if an MN has two WLAN interfaces to 
   eliminate a disruption period due to handover process, there is no 
   guarantee that the MN can select an AP with better performance for 
   a handover. In ubiquitous WLANs, the MN may find multiple candidate 
   APs at one time and needs to select an appropriate AP from among
   them. At this time, if an AP with better performance is not selected 
   appropriately, the communication quality may degrade after a 
   handover. In the current general AP selection, an MN selects an AP 
   with the strongest RSSI. However, since numerous APs and MNs will
   exist in high-density ubiquitous WLANs, radio interference, which 
   degrades communication quality, occurs frequently due to both the 
   lack of the number of channels and heavy traffic in the AP. Thus, 
   an AP selection method considering not only RSSI reduction but also 
   radio interference caused by other WLAN devices is essential for
   achieving seamless mobility.

   So far, there have been numerous discussions on AP selection for 
   improving the communication performance of MNs in WLANs[6-10]. 
   In ubiquitous WLANs, since an MN must be able to freely connect 
   with all APs for an inter-domain handover, it is desirable that 
   an AP is not modified in order to maintain compatibility with 
   existing APs. Almost all existing AP selection methods [6-9], 
   however, necessitate some modifications of APs, e.g., additional 
   information should be inserted in the beacon frame transmitted from 
   the AP. Moreover, the modification needs to be implemented in both 
   an AP and an MN. On the other hand, [10] explained that the effects 
   from hidden mobile nodes affect throughput degradation.

   In the method proposed herein, although modification of an AP is 
   unnecessary, the method is applied to only IEEE 802.11e, which has 
   not yet become widespread.  Therefore, in this article, we focus
   a new proactive AP selection method based on RSSI and frame 
   retransmissions. Since we have showed that the number of frame
   retransmissions is useful to detect radio interference in [5], 
   this article describes how to utilize the number of 
   frame retransmissions to AP selection method achieved in end-to-end. 
   The proposed AP selection method enables an MN to select an AP with 
   better performance taking radio interference into consideration by 
   exploiting the number of frame retransmissions in addition to
   the RSSI.


2. AP Selection Method

   Here, we describe the proposed AP selection method. We first describe
   the concept of the proposed method in Section 2.1. In Section 2.2, 
   we describe the proposed method with flowcharts.


2.1 Concept of the proposed AP selection

   This article focuses on a proactive AP selection for a radio 
   interference environment. In the handover method, we proposed in a 
   previous study [11], a multi-homed MN appropriately switches WLAN 
   interfaces (WIFs) according to wireless link condition. 
   Figure 1 shows an overview of operation between a handover and an 
   AP selection on an MN. An AP selection is performed on the WIF2 
   during communicating through the WIF1. On the other hand, after 
   a handover, since the communication switched to the WIF2, 
   the AP selection is next executed on the WIF1. That is, the AP 
   selection is always executed on an idle interface.

2.2 Details of the AP Selection Method

   In this section, we describe the proposed AP selection method. 
   The AP selection method is divided into two main parts: the AP 
   selection procedure and the AP search procedure, as shown in 
   Figures 2 and 3, respectively. In both figures, words in CAPITAL 
   denote the system parameters in the proposed AP selection method.
   In the AP selection procedure, an MN periodically investigates 
   the wireless link condition of an associating AP and decides whether 
   the wireless link has sufficient wireless link quality. On the other 
   hand, in the AP search procedure, an MN scans candidate APs and 
   selects an AP with better performance from among them. 
   Hence, MN starts the AP search procedure only when it detects the 
   degradation of the communication quality on the current interface 
   by exploiting the number of frame retries. That is, MN does not 
   start the AP search procedure even when the RSSI degrades unless 
   the frame retries increases.

              Fig.3 Flowchart of the AP search procedure


   In this section, in order to clarify the proposed AP selection 
   method, we assume that an MN with two WIFs (the WIF1 and the WIF2) 
   first communicates through the WIF1, and the WIF2 associates with 
   an AP with better performance at this time. Hence, the AP selection 


Taenaka, et al.          Expires: August 8, 2010                [Page 6]

draft-yuzo-ap-selection-considering-wlan-condition-00.txt   Febrary 2010


   procedure is executed on the WIF2. Initially, the MN starts a timer
   to control the AP selection procedure, i.e., the AP selection 
   procedure is periodically executed at each AP Selection Execution 
   Interval of APSEI seconds based on the timer. This is because an MN 
   needs to periodically investigate the wireless link condition of 
   the associating AP in order to detect changes in the wireless link 
   quality due to the movement of the MN and radio interference. 
   If the AP selection method is not periodically executed, an MN 
   unfortunately maintains the association with the AP until its 
   wireless link quality clearly degrades, similarly to an AP selection 
   based on the RSSI. This causes severe degradation of 
   the communication quality at handover. When the AP selection 
   procedure is executed, the WIF2 sends probe packets to the AP 
   at constant intervals. The Probe Packet Count (PPC) denotes 
   the number of probe packets for one AP, and the Probe Packet Interval
   (PPI) indicates the sending interval of probe packets. After sending 
   all of the probe packets, the MN obtains the number of frame 
   retransmissions for each probe packet. If the number of probe packets
   experiencing more than Experienced Retransmission Count (ERC)
   retransmissions is less than the Retransmission Count 
   Threshold (RCT), the MN decides that the AP has good wireless 
   link condition and maintains the connection with the AP.
   After selecting an AP with better performance, the procedure 
   terminates and then the MN executes the AP selection procedure 
   every APSEI seconds. 

   In contrast, if the number of probe packets that experience 
   more than ERC frame retransmissions exceeds RCT, i.e., the AP 
   associated with the WIF2 is not an AP with better performance, 
   an AP search procedure is executed. As shown in Fig. 3, in the AP
   search procedure, the MN first makes a list of all candidate APs 
   detected by the WIF2, and removes the APs currently associated by 
   the WIF1/2 from the list. In our approach, to efficiently find 
   an AP with better performance, our proposed method first checks 
   the RSSI of candidate APs because the RSSI can be easily and 
   passively obtained than the number of frame retransmissions. 
   That is, it does not need both establishment of the association 
   with APs and the packet transmission of probe packets. 
   Therefore in our proposed scheme, after temporary sorting 
   the candidate APs based on the strength of the RSSI, the MN 
   investigates the APs by exploiting the number of 
   frame retransmissions in order of high RSSI. If not sorting, 
   the MN may transmit unnecessary packets to an AP with 
   low performance (low RSSI), not to an AP with good performance 
   (high RSSI). Hence, creation of an AP list based on RSSI prevents 
   the unnecessary packet transmissions and shortens the detection time
   as much as possible. In the flowchart, if the number of packets
   experiencing more than ERC-times frame retries exceeds RCT, 
   our proposed scheme detects the degradation in the wireless condition
   of the selected AP degrades and then the investigation is repeated 
   in order of high RSSI until finding an AP with better performance.
   If an AP with better quality cannot be found, the MN retries the AP
   search at the next AP selection, i.e., after APSEI seconds.

   After finishing these procedures, the MN can select an AP with low 
   radio interference and strong RSSI.


3. Conclusion
   In this article, in order to select an AP with better performance 
   from among multiple candidate APs in ubiquitous WLANs, we discussed
   a proactive AP selection method based on frame retransmissions and 
   the RSSI. In an AP selection based on only the RSSI, an MN cannot 
   always select an AP with better performance in ubiquitous WLANs, 
   because the RSSI alone cannot detect the degradation of wireless link 
   quality due to radio interference. We therefore used the number of 
   frame retransmissions as an index for detecting radio interference 
   in addition to the RSSI and then proposed an AP selection method for 
   the proposed handover management system.
