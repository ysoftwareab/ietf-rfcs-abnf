                 Authentication Method Reference Values
                    draft-jones-oauth-amr-values-00

Abstract

   The "amr" (Authentication Methods References) claim is defined and
   registered in the IANA "JSON Web Token Claims" registry but no
   standard Authentication Method Reference values are currently
   defined.  This specification establishes a registry for
   Authentication Method Reference values and defines an initial set of
   Authentication Method Reference values.  It also defines the
   "amr_values" (requested Authentication Method Reference values)
   request parameter for requesting that a set of Authentication Method
   Reference values be used for processing the Authentication Request.

Internet-Draft   Authentication Method Reference Values        July 2015


1.  Introduction

   The "amr" (Authentication Methods References) claim is defined and
   registered in the IANA "JSON Web Token Claims" registry
   [IANA.JWT.Claims] but no standard Authentication Method Reference
   values are currently defined.  This specification establishes a
   registry for Authentication Method Reference values and defines an
   initial set of Authentication Method Reference values.  It also
   defines the "amr_values" (requested Authentication Method Reference
   values) request parameter for requesting that a set of Authentication
   Method Reference values be used for processing the Authentication
   Request.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   This specification uses the terms defined by JSON Web Token (JWT)
   [JWT] and OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core].


2.  Authentication Method Reference Values

   The "amr" (Authentication Methods References) claim is defined by the
   OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification [OpenID.Core] as follows:

   amr
      OPTIONAL.  Authentication Methods References.  JSON array of
      strings that are identifiers for authentication methods used in
      the authentication.  For instance, values might indicate that both
      password and OTP authentication methods were used.  The definition
      of particular values to be used in the "amr" Claim is beyond the
      scope of this specification.  Parties using this claim will need
      to agree upon the meanings of the values used, which may be
      context-specific.  The "amr" value is an array of case sensitive
      strings.

   However, OpenID Connect does not specify any particular
   Authentication Method Reference values to be used in the "amr" claim.
   The following is a list of Authentication Method Reference values
   defined by this specification:

Internet-Draft   Authentication Method Reference Values        July 2015


   pwd
      Password authentication, either by the user or the service if a
      client secret is used

   pop
      Proof of possession of a key

   otp
      One time password

   fpt
      Fingerprint biometric

   eye
      Retina scan biometric

   vbm
      Voice biometric

   tel
      Confirmation by telephone call

   sms
      Confirmation by SMS reply

   kba
      Knowledge based authentication

   wia
      Windows integrated authentication

   mfa
      Multiple factor authentication.  When this is present, the other
      authentication methods used will also be included.


3.  Authentication Request Parameter

   This section defines the following authentication request parameter,
   augmenting the set of authentication request parameters defined in
   Section 3.1.2.1 of OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core]:

   amr_values
      OPTIONAL.  Requested Authentication Method Reference values.
      Space-separated string that specifies the "amr" values that the
      Authorization Server is being requested to use for processing this
      Authentication Request, with the values appearing in order of
      preference.  The authentication methods used for the

Internet-Draft   Authentication Method Reference Values        July 2015


      authentication performed are returned as the "amr" Claim Value.


4.  Relationship to "acr" (Authentication Context Class Reference)

   The "acr" (Authentication Context Class Reference) claim and
   "acr_values" request parameter are related to the "amr"
   (Authentication Methods References) claim and "amr_values" request
   parameter, but with important differences.  Authentication Context
   Classes specify a set of business rules that authentications are
   being requested to satisfy.  These rules can often be satisfied by
   using a number of different specific authentication methods, either
   singly or in combination.  Interactions using "acr" request that
   specified Authentication Context Classes be used and reply saying
   which Authentication Context Class was satisfied.  The reply states
   that it was satisfied -- not how it was satisfied.

   In contrast, interactions using "amr" make statements about the
   particular authentication methods that are used.  This tends to be
   more brittle than using "acr" since the authentication methods that
   may be appropriate for a given authentication will vary over time,
   both because of the evolution of attacks on existing methods and the
   creation of new authentication methods.


5.  Privacy Considerations

   The list of "amr" claim values returned in an ID Token reveals
   information about the way that the end-user authenticated to the
   identity provider.  In some cases, this information may have privacy
   implications.


6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in OpenID Connect Core 1.0 [OpenID.Core],
   OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], and the OAuth 2.0 Threat Model [RFC6819] apply
   to this specification.

   As described in Section 4, taking a dependence upon particular
   authentication methods may result in brittle systems, since the
   authentication methods that may be appropriate for a given
   authentication will vary over time.


7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Authentication Method Reference Values Registry

   This specification establishes the IANA "Authentication Method
   Reference Values" registry for "amr" claim array element values.  The
   registry records the Authentication Method Reference value and a
   reference to the specification that defines it.  This specification
   registers the Authentication Method Reference values defined in
   Section 2.

   Values are registered on a Specification Required [RFC5226] basis
   after a three-week review period on the jwt-reg-review@ietf.org
   mailing list, on the advice of one or more Designated Experts.
   However, to allow for the allocation of values prior to publication,
   the Designated Experts may approve registration once they are
   satisfied that such a specification will be published.

   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use
   an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register Authentication
   Method Reference value: otp").

   Within the review period, the Designated Experts will either approve
   or deny the registration request, communicating this decision to the
   review list and IANA.  Denials should include an explanation and, if
   applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.
   Registration requests that are undetermined for a period longer than
   21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention (using the
   iesg@ietf.org mailing list) for resolution.

   Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts includes
   determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing
   functionality, whether it is likely to be of general applicability or
   whether it is useful only for a single application, and whether the
   registration description is clear.

   IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Experts
   and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
   list.

   It is suggested that the same Designated Experts evaluate these
   registration requests as those who evaluate registration requests for
   the IANA "JSON Web Token Claims" registry [IANA.JWT.Claims].

   Authentication Method Reference Name:
      The name requested (e.g., "otp").  Because a core goal of this
      specification is for the resulting representations to be compact,
      it is RECOMMENDED that the name be short -- that is, not to exceed
      8 characters without a compelling reason to do so.  This name is
      case sensitive.  Names may not match other registered names in a
      case-insensitive manner unless the Designated Experts state that
      there is a compelling reason to allow an exception.

   Authentication Method Reference Description:
      Brief description of the Authentication Method Reference (e.g.,
      "One time password").

   Change Controller:
      For Standards Track RFCs, state "IESG".  For others, give the name
      of the responsible party.  Other details (e.g., postal address,
      email address, home page URI) may also be included.

   Specification Document(s):
      Reference to the document or documents that specify the parameter,
      preferably including URIs that can be used to retrieve copies of
      the documents.  An indication of the relevant sections may also be
      included but is not required.
