    WHERE DOES THIS FIT IN THE PICTURE OF THE SUB-IP WORK

    This fits in the PPVPN box.

    WHY IS IT TARGETTED AT THIS WG

    This work fits in the PPVPN working group charter.  It describes a
    service that uses an emulation of a Layer 2 medium to create a
    provider provisioned virtual private network [1], specifically, a
    Transparent LAN service.
    
    JUSTIFICATION

    We believe the WG should consider this draft because it specifies
    signaling for a class of layer 2 VPN that has up to now not been
    sufficiently addressed in this WG.

 2. Introduction

    This document describes how to signal a Virtual Private Switched
    Network (VPSN), which, in the context of Ethernet, is very similar
    to a Transparent LAN Service (TLS).  The VPSN operates over a packet
    switched network that has tunneling capabilities.  The requirements
    for a VPSN are given in [2].

    A VPSN provides the ability to mimic the behavior of an Ethernet
    LAN.  Several proposals exist to create a tunneled Ethernet service
    [3][4], but they address point-to-point tunneling of Ethernet
    frames.  Simply using point-to-point tunneling of Ethernet frames,
    it is possible to create a multi-point service, but it is extremely
    inefficient.  By adding the ability to learn MAC addresses and
    associate them with tunnel endpoints, it is possible to create a
    more efficient VPSN.


 3. Virtual Private Switched Network

    In a VPSN, packets are carried across a transit network so that the
    source and destination networks operate as if inter-connected by a
    LAN.  In the past, ATM has been used to provide TLS.  Rather than
    overlay a TLS-like service over ATM, this document describes how a
    VPSN can be created over a tunneled network, where the tunneling
    technology is not hardware-specific.  This document describes
    extensions to [3] to provide VPSN service.  The encapsulation of the
    packets will follow the Ethernet or the Ethernet VLAN specifications
    given in [5].  All nodes of a VPSN MUST use the same encapsulation.

    Throughout this document, we will use LDP as the signaling protocol
    for the VPSN.  Targeted LDP between the PEs is all that is assumed.
    A future document addresses signaling using Multi-protocol
    extensions to BGP.  We make no assumption about the nature of the
    transport tunnels that actually carry the traffic between PEs.  For
    example, they may be traffic engineered tunnels set up with RSVP-TE,
    LDP, GRE or MPLS/IP tunnels.


 4. Tunneled VPSN

    Consider the following provider network, over which a VPSN service
    is to be provisioned.  Customer A has three sites, with three local
    area networks, A1, A2, and A3, that need to be connected.  CEs
    represent customer edge routers and PEs represent provider edge
    routers.

    The general problem is MAC address discovery.  If it is not known
    where the destination MAC addresses for a certain location are, then
    the only way for a packet sourced, say at A1, to reach one of the
    nodes in A2 or A3, is to broadcast (or multicast) the packet.
    Broadcasts and multicasts are hard to do over a tunneled network,
    where the efficiencies of sending single packets are lost.  However,
    this is not unlike the problem of interconnecting multiple LANs at a
    single location.  The problem is solved using learning bridges which
    learn MAC addresses and are able to squelch the transmission of
    packets to a MAC address on a particular subnet because they know
    that MAC address is not there.

    Using the network below as an example setup, we describe two
    different methods for making VPSN services possible.  Then we
    describe the signaling required to make it all work.


 4.1. MAC Address Learning

    Initially, the VPSN is set up so that PE1, PE2 and PE3 have a full-
    mesh of tunnels between them for carrying tunneled traffic.  The
    VPSN service is assigned a VCID (a 32-bit quantity that is unique
    across the provider network across all VPSNs).  The VC Type for
    VPSNs, the Ethernet VLAN VC type, is associated with the VCID. 
    Unlike [3], a VCID is unique within a provider domain.  Allocation
    of domain-wide unique VCIDs is outside the scope of this draft.

    For the above example, say PE1 signals VC Label 102 to PE2 and 103
    to PE3, and PE2 signals VC Label 201 to PE1 and 203 to PE3.

    Assume a packet from A1 is bound for A2.  When it leaves CE1, say it
    has a source MAC address of M1 and a destination MAC of M2.  If PE1
    does not know where M2 is, it will multicast the packet to PE2 and
    
    Kompella, et al            Expires January 2002           [Page 4]
     
    
    Internet Draft    draft-vkompella-ppvpn-vpsn-mpls-00.txt   July 2001
    
    PE3.  When PE2 receives the packet, it will have an inner label of
    201.  PE2 can conclude that the source MAC address M1 is behind PE1,
    since it distributed the label 201 to PE1.  It can therefore
    associate MAC address M1 with VC Label 102.

    Note that the two different encapsulations, Ethernet and Ethernet
    VLAN, lead to two slightly different learning algorithms.  We
    describe them below. 


 4.1.1.  MAC Address Learning with Ethernet Encapsulation

    When the Ethernet encapsulation is used, the PE is service unaware,
    i.e., it does not distinguish between frames that have 802.1q tags
    and those that do not.  The model is one that allows overlaying
    multiple VLANs over a single VPSN.  In this model, a PE MUST learn
    based on both the 802.1q tag and the MAC address.  This is to take
    care of unfortunate duplicate MAC addresses used in different
    customer VLANs.


 4.1.2.  MAC Address Learning with Ethernet VLAN Encapsulation

    When the Ethernet VLAN encapsulation is used, the PE is service
    aware, i.e., it associates that particular VLAN with the VPSN.  The
    PE can safely learn based on the MAC address alone.


 5. MAC Address Management

    From the above description, it is clear that MAC addresses are being
    learned at multiple locations.  For example, the CEs may learn MAC
    addresses through ARP (for IPv4 traffic), since the VPSN service
    behaves like a LAN.  CEs can be out of sync with PEs that also have
    to learn MAC addresses and associate them with VC Labels.  (This is
    one reason why a CE may know the MAC address of another CE router,
    but the PE routers may need to relearn them).


 5.1. Aging MAC Addresses

    PEs that learn remote MAC addresses need to have an aging mechanism
    to remove unused entries associated with a VC Label.  This is
    important both for conservation of memory as well as for
    administrative purposes.  For example, if customer site A1 has
    another CE connected to PE1, and CE1 is shut down, eventually, the
    other PEs should unlearn CE1's MAC address.  

    As with existing LAN bridges, two aging timers SHOULD be implemented
    on a PE.  First, a local aging of MAC addresses learned from the
    customer-facing network SHOULD be implemented with a shorter value
    of the timer.  Second, a remote aging of MAC addresses learned
    
    Kompella, et al            Expires January 2002           [Page 5]
     
    
    Internet Draft    draft-vkompella-ppvpn-vpsn-mpls-00.txt   July 2001
    
    during the operation of the VPSN SHOULD be implemented with a
    considerably longer timer value.  The remote aging timer keeps
    entries around longer, since the loss of an entry entails a
    broadcast across the VPSN to discover the MAC address location.

    As packets arrive from the customer-facing network, local MAC
    addresses SHOULD be remembered, along with aging.  The aging timer
    for MAC address M SHOULD be reset when a packet is received from the
    customer-facing with source MAC address M.

    As packets arrive from the remote PEs, remote MAC addresses SHOULD
    be learned.  The aging timer for a remote MAC address M SHOULD be
    reset when a packet arrives from a remote PE with source MAC address
    M.


 5.2. MAC Address Signaling

    There should be a more proactive manner of installing MAC address
    associations and removing them for faster convergence.  We introduce
    a MAC TLV that is used to specify a list of MAC addresses that can
    be added or removed using the Address Message and the Address
    Withdraw Message, respectively.

    The Address Withdraw message with MAC TLVs SHOULD be supported in
    order to uninstall learned MAC addresses that have moved or gone
    away more quickly.  It is not quite as essential that the Address
    message with MAC TLVs be supported.  Once a MAC address is
    unlearned, re-learning occurs through flooding, so the Address
    message only prevents flooding.  The Address message MAY be
    supported.


 5.2.1.  MAC TLV

    MAC addresses can be signaled using an LDP Address Message.  We
    define a new TLV, the MAC TLV.  Its format is described below.  The
    encoding of a MAC TLV address is a 2-byte 802.1q tag, followed by
    the 6-byte MAC address encoding specified by IEEE 802 documents [6]. 
    The 802.1q tag and the MAC address MUST appear in pairs.  If no tag
    is required, the value of the tag field MUST be zero.

    U bit
            Unknown bit.  This bit MUST be set to 0.  If the MAC address
    format is not understood, then the TLV is not understood, and MUST
    be ignored.

    F bit
            Forward bit.  This bit MUST be set to 0.  Since the LDP
    mechanism used here is Targeted, the TLV MUST NOT be forwarded.

    Type
            Type field.  This field MUST be set to 0x0404 (subject to
    IANA approval).  This identifies the TLV type as MAC TLV.

    Length
            Length field.  This field specifies the total length of the
    TLV, including the Type and Length fields.

    S bit
            Static bit.  In an Address Message, this bit indicates
    whether the MAC addresses specified in the TLV are static or
    dynamic.  If the bit is set, the addresses are static, and MUST NOT
    be aged out.  If it is clear, the addresses are dynamic, and SHOULD
    be aged.  The S bit has no significance in an Address Withdraw
    Message, and MUST be zero.

    Reserved
            Reserved bits.  They MUST NOT be interpreted at the
    receiver, and MUST be set to zero by the sender.

    802.1q Tag
            The 802.1q Tag.  The value MUST be zero if the Ethernet VLAN
    encapsulation is used.  If the Ethernet encapsulation is used, and
    the Ethernet address is associated with a VLAN, it MUST be set to
    the VLAN tag.  If the Ethernet encapsulation is used, and the MAC
    address is not associated with a VLAN, it MUST be set to zero. 
    Since an 802.1q tag is 12-bits, the high 4 bits of the field MUST be
    set to zero.

    MAC Address
            The MAC address being signaled.
    
    The LDP Address Message contains a FEC TLV (to identify the VPSN in
    consideration), a MAC Address TLV and optional parameters.  No
    optional parameters have been defined for MAC Address signaling.

    The LDP Address Withdraw Message contains a FEC TLV (to identify the
    VPSN in consideration), a MAC Address TLV and optional parameters.

    No optional parameters have been defined for the MAC Address
    Withdraw signaling.


 5.2.2.  Address Message Containing MAC TLV

    The processing for MAC TLVs received in an Address Message is:

      For each (q-tag, MAC address) pair in the MAC TLV:
         - If a mapping between the (q-tag, MAC address) pair and a VC
            label exists, then, remove the existing mapping, and replace
            it with the new association.  If the S bit is on in the TLV,
            then each (q-tag, MAC address) is not aged.  Otherwise, an
            aging timer with the remote aging timer value SHOULD be
            started.
         - If a mapping does not exist, then install a new mapping
            between (q-tag, MAC Address) pair and VC label.  If the S
            bit is on in the TLV, then each the mapping is not aged. 
            Otherwise, an aging timer with the remote aging timer value
            SHOULD be started.

    The scope of a MAC TLV is the VPSN specified in the FEC TLV in the
    Address Message.

    Note that each MAC TLV contains a number of (q-tag, MAC address)
    pairs with the same property, i.e., either static or dynamic.  A
    single Address Message MAY contain multiple MAC TLVs.  The number of
    MAC addresses can be deduced from the length field in the TLV.


 5.2.3.  Address Withdraw Message Containing MAC TLV

    When MAC addresses are being removed explicitly, e.g., an adjacent
    CE router has been disconnected, an Address Withdraw Message can be
    sent with the list of MAC addresses to be withdrawn.

    The processing for MAC TLVs received in an Address Withdraw Message
    is:

      For each (q-tag, MAC address) pair in the TLV:
         - Remove the association between the (q-tag, MAC address) pair
            and VC label.  It does not matter whether the MAC address
            was installed as a static or dynamic address.

    The scope of a MAC TLV is the VPSN specified in the FEC TLV in the
    Address Withdraw Message.

    The number of MAC addresses can be deduced from the length field in
    the TLV.  The address list MAY be empty.  In this case, the S bit
    and the 15-bit Reserved field are not sent, i.e., the length field
    would be set to 4.  This tells the receiving LSR to delete any MAC

 5.2.4.  LDP Session Failure or Termination

    When a targeted LDP session is torn down or terminated, all
    associated MAC address mappings MUST be removed.


 5.3. Discussion on MAC TLVs

    Several standard bridging issues can be handled with MAC Address
    registrations and withdrawals without having to resort to a spanning
    tree protocol.  They arise from topology changes that move a MAC
    address from one PE to another either because of a physical
    reorganization, or because of a spanning tree action on the
    customer-facing network.  These TLVs MAY be triggered by some
    conditions that can be vendor-specific, depending on the types of
    CE-PE interactions the vendor supports.

    For example, suppose a CE router connects in to a VPSN at PE1.  All
    the PEs participating in the VPSN learn of its MAC address and that
    it is served by PE1.  If the CE router disconnects from PE1 and
    connects to PE2, all the PE routers need to re-learn its new
    position.  If the other PEs wait until a packet from PE2 is sent
    carrying M as the source MAC, then only those PEs who receive such
    packets will be able to update their MAC mapping tables.  Instead, a
    PE SHOULD send an LDP Address Withdraw message with a MAC TLV to
    flush out entries.  There are two cases where it is advisable to
    send MAC TLVs.


 5.3.1.  Physical Network Reorganization

    When a CE router, CE1, connects in to a different PE than it used
    to, the PEs participating in the VPSN should all discover this
    change as soon as possible.  Suppose CE1 connects in to PE1
    initially.  All PEs in the VPSN learn of CE1's MAC address.  At some
    point, CE1 is disconnected from PE1, and reconnected at PE2.  PE2
    locally learns that CE1 is behind it.  Since it already has CE1's
    MAC address in its table, registered as being served by PE1, PE2
    SHOULD send out an Address Withdraw message with CE1's MAC address.

    
 5.3.2.  Spanning Tree Action

    A CE router, CE1, may be multi-homed into the provider network at
    PE1 and PE2.  If spanning tree is run on the customer-facing
    network, then one of the links CE1-PE1 or CE1-PE2 will be blocked.

    Suppose CE1-PE1 is active and CE1-PE2 is blocked.  Now, if CE1-PE1
    goes down, CE1-PE2 is unblocked, and CE1's MAC address appears to be
    served by PE2.  PE2 SHOULD send out an Address Withdraw message with
    CE1's MAC address.


 6. Signaling a VPSN

    As described in [3], LDP will be used in Downstream Unsolicited mode
    to distribute VC labels.  LDP will be used with targeted peers.  The
    FEC TLV is defined as in [3].

    VC, C, VC Type, VC Info Length, Group ID, Interface parameters
         As defined in [3].
    VCID
            The VCID is defined much as in [3].  The only difference is
    that it is globally unique within a provider domain, independently
    of the VC Type.


 6.1. Adjacency and Session Management

    As in normal LDP Downstream Unsolicited operation, when a PE is
    configured as part of a VPSN, it issues a Targeted Hello to each
    other PE in the VPSN.  The actual discovery of those other PEs that
    are part of the VPSN will be addressed in companion drafts, using
    BGP advertisements and LDP signaling, respectively.

    When a Targeted Hello is received, if the receiving PE is not
    configured to be part of the VPSN, it MAY send back a Label Release. 
    However, the Liberal Label Retention SHOULD be used [3], wherein a
    PE that does not participate in a VPSN may still retain a received
    VC label.  The VC would be set up only when the PE is configured to
    be a member of the VPSN, and reciprocates with its own VC label
    mapping.

    Note that the act of instantiating a VPSN on a PE triggers LDP
    session setup and VC label exchange, and since VC label exchange

    occurs in both directions, Liberal Label Retention Mode is not
    necessary.




 7. Security Considerations

    No new security issues result from this draft.  It is recommended in
    [2] that LDP security (authentication) methods [7] be applied.  This
    would prevent unauthorized participation by a PE in a VPSN.  Traffic
    separation for VPSNs is maintained using VC labels.  However, for
    additional levels of security, the customer MAY deploy end-to-end
    security, which is out of the scope of this draft.
