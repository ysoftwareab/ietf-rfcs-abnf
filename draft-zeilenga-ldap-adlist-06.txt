Abstract

  The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) search operation
  provides mechanisms for clients to request all user application
  attributes, all operational attributes, or attributes selected by
  their description.  This document extends LDAP to provide a mechanism
  for LDAP clients to request the return of all attributes of an object
  class.

1.  Overview

  In the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC3377], the
  search operation [RFC2251] support requesting a sets of attributes.
  This set is determined by a list of attribute descriptions.  Two
  special descriptors are defined to request all user attributes ("*")
  [RFC2251] and all operational attributes ("+") [OPATTRS].  However,
  there is no convenient mechanism for requesting pre-defined sets of
  attributes.

  This document extends LDAP to allow an object class identifier to be
  specified in search request attributes list to request the return all
  attributes allowed by object class.  A plus sign ("+", U+002B) is used
  to distinguish an object class identifier from an attribute
  descriptions.

  For example, the attribute list of "+country" is equivalent to the
  attribute list of 'c', 'searchGuide', 'description', and
  'objectClass'.  This object class and its attributes are described in
  [RFC2256].

  This extension is intended to be used where the user is in direct
  control of the parameters of the LDAP search operation, such as when
  entering a LDAP URL [RFC2255] into a web browser.


2. Terminology

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

  DSA stands for Directory System Agent (or server).
  DSE stands for DSA-specific Entry.


3.  Return of all Attributes of an Object Class

  This extension allows object class identifiers is to be provided in
  the attributes field of the LDAP SearchRequest [RFC2251].  For each
  object class identified in the attributes field, the request is to be
  treated as if each attribute allowed by that class (by "MUST" or
  "MAY", directly or by SUPerior) was itself listed.

  If the object class identifier is unrecognized, it is be treated an an
  unrecognized attribute description.

  This extension redefines the attributes field of the SearchRequest to

INTERNET-DRAFT        draft-zeilenga-ldap-adlist-06      26 October 2003


  be a DescriptionList described by the following ASN.1 [X.680] data
  type:

       DescriptionList ::= SEQUENCE OF Description
       Description ::= LDAPString

  The Description is string conforming to the ABNF [RFC2234]:

       Description = AttributeDescription | ObjectClassDescription.
       ObjectClassDescription = "+" ObjectClass *( ";" options )

  where <AttributeDescription> and <options> productions are as defined
  in Section 4.1.5 of [RFC2251] and an <ObjectClass> is an object
  identifier, in either <numericoid> or <descr> form [RFC2252], of an
  object class.

  <ObjectClassDescription> <options> are provided for extensibility.
  This document only defines semantics of <ObjectClassDescription>s with
  zero options in the attributes field of a SearchRequest.  Other uses
  may be defined in future specifications.

  Servers supporting this feature SHOULD publish the object identifier
  (OID) 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.2 as a value of the 'supportedFeatures'
  [FEATURES] attribute in the root DSE.  Clients supporting this feature
  SHOULD NOT use the feature unless they have knowledge the server
  supports it.


3.  Security Considerations

  This extension provides a shorthand for requesting all attributes of
  an object class.  As these attributes which could have been listed
  individually, this short hand is not believed to raise additional
  security considerations.

  Implementors of this (or any) LDAP extension should be familiar with
  general LDAP security considerations [RFC3377].


4.  IANA Considerations

  The OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.2 is used to identify the LDAP "OC AD
  List" feature.  This OID was assigned [ASSIGN] by OpenLDAP Foundation,
  under its IANA-assigned private enterprise allocation [PRIVATE], for
  use in this specification.

  Registration of this protocol mechanism is requested per BCP 64
  [RFC3383].
