Abstract

   This document defines a YANG model for managing dynamic Optical
   networks, including Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON) and
   Flexi-Grid DWDM Networks. The model described in this document is
   composed of two submodels: one to define an optical traffic
   engineering database, and other one to describe the optical paths or
   media channels.

1. Introduction

   Internet-based traffic is dramatically increasing every year.
   Moreover, such traffic is also becoming more dynamic. Thus,

   transport networks need to evolve from current DWDM systems towards
   elastic optical networks, based on flexi-grid transmission and
   switching technologies. This technology aims at increasing both
   transport network scalability and flexibility, allowing the
   optimization of bandwidth usage.

   This document presents a YANG model for objects in the dynamic
   optical network, including the nodes, transponders and links between
   them, as well as how such links interconnect nodes and transponders.

   The model presented in this document considers two different optical
   technologies: Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON) [5] and
   flexi-grid DWDM Networks [6]. The YANG model allows the
   representation of the optical layer of a network, combined with the
   underlying physical layer. The model is defined in two YANG modules:

   o Optical-TED (Traffic Engineering Database): This module defines
      all the information needed to represent an optical node, an
      optical transponder and an optical link.

   o Media-channel: This module defines the whole path from a source
      transponder to the destination through a number of intermediate
      nodes.

   This document identifies the WSON and Flexi-Grid optical components,
   parameters and their values, characterizes the features and the
   performances of the optical elements. An application example is
   provided towards the end of the document to better understand their
   utility.

3. Optical network topology model overview

   YANG is a data modeling language used to model configuration data
   manipulated by the NETCONF protocol. For more information on YANG,
   the document [7] provides a tutorial with some examples on how to
   model the information and use the YANG structures.

   Several YANG models have already been specified for network
   configurations. For instance, the work in [8] has proposed a YANG
   model of a TED, but only covering the IP layer. A YANG model has
   also been proposed in [9] to configure optical DWDM parameters. On
   the other hand, a TED has been proposed for optical networks in
   [10], but this approach did not specify a YANG model to enable its
   configuration.

   As stated before, we propose a model to describe an optical topology
   that is split in two YANG sub-modules:

   . Optical-TED: In order to be compatible with existing proposals, we
     augment the definitions contained in [8], by defining the
     different elements we find in an optical network: a node, a
     transponder and a link. For that, each of those elements is
     defined as a container that includes a group of attributes.
     References to the elements are provided to be later used in the
     definition of a media channel. It also includes the data types for
     the type of modulation, the optical technology, the FEC, etc.
   . Media-channel: This module defines the whole path from a source
     transponder to the destination through a number of intermediate
     nodes and links. For this, it takes the information defined before
     in the optical TED.
   Next section provides a detailed view of each module.

4. Main building blocks

   Subsections below detail each of the defined YANG modules. They are
   listed in Appendix A, and have been validated using the pyang tool
   [11].

   Optical Tributary Signal. In the model, the network media channel
   has as end-points transponders, which are the source and destination
   of the optical signal. The description of these components is
   provided below:

   freq-slot>

   In order to explain how this model is used, we provide the following
   example. An optical network usually has multiple transponders,
   switches (nodes) and links between them. Figure 1 shows a simple
   topology, where two physical paths interconnect two optical
   transponders.

                      Figure 1. Topology example.

   In order to configure a media channel to interconnect transponders A
   and E, first of all we have to populate the optical TED YANG model
   with all elements in the network:

   1. We define the transponders A and E, including their FEC type, if
      enabled, and modulation type. We also provide node identifiers
      and addresses for the transponders, as well as interfaces
      included in the transponders. It is also possible sliceable
      transponders if needed.

   2. We do the same for the nodes B, C and D, providing their
      identifiers, addresses and interfaces, as well as the internal
      connectivity matrix between interfaces.

   3. Then, we also define the links 1 to 5 that interconnect nodes and
      transponders, indicating which labels are available, both in
      flexi-grid or WSON. Other information, such as the slot frequency
      and granularity are also provided.

   Next, we can configure the media channel from the information we
   have stored in the optical TED, by querying which elements are
   available, and planning the resources that have to be provided on
   each situation. Note that every element in the optical TED has a
   reference, and this is the way in which they are called in the media
   channel.

   4. Depending on the case, it is possible to define either the source
      and destination node ports, or the source and destination node
      and transponder. In our case, we would define a network media
      channel, with source transponder A and source node B, and
      destination transponder E and destination node C. Thus, we are
      going to follow path x.

   5. Then, for each link in the path x, we indicate which channel we
      are going to use, providing information about the slots, and what
      nodes are connected.

   Finally, the optical TED has to be updated with each element usage
   status each time a media channel is created or torn down.

6. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [2].

7. Security Considerations

   The transport protocol used for sending the managed information MUST
   support authentication and SHOULD support encryption.

   The defined data-model by itself does not create any security
   implications.

8. IANA Considerations

   The namespace used in the defined models is currently based on the
   IDEALIST project URI. Future versions of this document could
   register a URI in the IETF XML registry [3], as well as in the YANG
   Module Names registry [4].
