This document clarifies    the model of the GMPLS-controlled integrated PSC/LSC label switch    router (LSR) and discusses the requirements of the routing extensions    needed to realize optimized multi-layer traffic    engineering.Imajuku                                                        [Page 1]Internet Draft       draft-imajuku-ml-routing-01.txt   28 February 20021. Introduction   Generalized-MPLS (GMPLS) makes it easier to realize the seamless   integration of IP Networks with legacy SDH/SONET or Photonic    networks. In particular, integration of the packet switching    capability and the photonic switching technology under a unified    GMPLS control plane would significantly enhance the forwarding    capacity of the IP network [Shimano01]. One of the other forces    driving the construction of a unified GMPLS control plane is the    desire to implement multi-layer routing capability, which would    enable effective network resource utilization of both the IP-layer    and the SDH/SONET or Photonic-layer in the next generation large   capacity IP+Photonic network [Oki02].   In such network, each LSR would contain multiple-type switching    capabilities such as PSC and Time-Division-Multiplexing    (or SDH/SONET XC) (TDM), PSC and Lambda switching (LSC), LSC and    Fiber switching (FSC), etc. These LSRs with integrated switch    capabilities are required to hold resource information of not only    their own link states and network topology but also those of other    LSR's, since circuit switch capable units such as TDMs, LSCs, FSCs    require rigid resource reservation unlike PSCs. In addition, these    LSRs are also required to discriminate link state data as to which    layer these links belong, so as to provide multi-layer routing    functionality.   The implementation of such functionality enables seamless multi-layer   optimized route calculation such that the conventional label switched    path (LSP) call setup automatically triggers new optical label    switched path (OLSP) setup where the unused resources of inner    interfaces between PSC functional block and LSC functional block    in the OLSP destination node are considered.   If it is not possible to reserve the resources of the inner interface   between PSC and LSC in the OLSP destination node, a different OLSP is   setup that connects to a different intermediate LSR, and the LSP-call   can be accommodated by the new OLSP and subsequent hops through other   existing OLSPs until it reaches the destination node of the LSP-call.   This draft proposes several extensions to the link state information    of OSPF/ISIS disseminated to all LSRs in the routing area to realize    multi-layer routing. The extension of link state information includes   the basic concept of the interface switching capability descriptor    as discussed in [GMPLS-ROURING] and [GMPLS-OSPF]. The content of this   document is as follows. First, it models the GMPLS-based LSR with Imajuku                                                        [Page 2]Internet Draft       draft-imajuku-ml-routing-01.txt   28 February 2002   multi-layer switching capabilities. Second, it discusses the aspect of   multi-layer routing and the specification of the link state    advertisements (LSAs). Last, it discusses the interaction with FA-LSP    and it's LSAs that are to be disseminated to other LSRs in response    to the creation of LSPs. 2. The node model of GMPLS based LSRs with lambda switching capability   This section clarifies the model of switching capable in GMPLS-based    LSRs to clarify the requirements for multi-layer routing under the    unified GMPLS-control plane. 2.1 LSC-LSR   The first model is LSR with LSC only. The LSC handles each OLSP to    switch from fiber to fiber. This type of LSR does not have packet-   level switching capability. Therefore, other LSRs in the same routing   area (or domain) shall recognize that the LSR does not have the    functionalities of IP packet routing and LSP switching.   Requirement: When there is no unused input and output port in the    LSR, the LSR shall be identified as an LSC router that has no OLSP   forwarding capability.                        _______                       |       |          __\     /|___|       |___|\            /    | |___|       |___| |   Fiber #1         ========| |___|  LSC  |___| |========                 | |___|       |___| |                  \|   |       |   |/                       |       |                       .       .                       .       .          __\     /|___|       |___|\            /    | |___|       |___| |   Fiber #N         ========| |___|       |___| |========                 | |___|       |___| |Imajuku                                                        [Page 3]Internet Draft       draft-imajuku-ml-routing-01.txt   28 February 2002                  \|   |       |   |/                       |_______|   If the LSC-LSR does not have wavelength conversion capability    (common in most all-optical networks), the information as to which   wavelength channel can be reserved in a fiber link plays the most   important role in route selection within OLSP setup. Thus, LSC-   LSR shall also recognize and advertise the status of the unused    wavelength channel number as described in the document [OKI-OLI].   In the process of constructing the network topology from fiber link    state data, each fiber link connected to LSRs may be identified as a    TE-link between neighboring LSRs. Component links, which may    correspond to wavelength channels or LSC switch ports in one or    multiple fibers, are bundled into a TE-link, where all wavelength    information is aggregated [LINK-BUNDLE].2.2 LSR with PSC+LSC   The second model is LSR with PSC+LSC. The PSC is connected to the    LSC via internal interfaces between the PSC function block and    the LSC function block. The LSC handles each OLSP to switch    from fiber to fiber. This type of LSR offers the switching    capabilities of both conventional LSPs and OLSPs. Therefore, other    LSRs in the same routing area (or domain) shall recognize that the    LSR has the capability of forwarding both IP packets and OLSPs.   Requirements:    If all switch ports of the LSC function block are occupied, an OLSP   setup call transferring or terminating at the LSR shall be rejected.   In such a case, other LSRs in the same routing area (or domain) shall    recognize that the PSC+LSC router has no LSC reservation capability.    If all inner interfaces between the LSC function block and the PSC    function block are reserved, the LSR shall be identified as a PSC+LSC   router that has no OLSP termination capability. If the PSC function    block is in a failure state, the LSR shall be identified as a PSC+LSC   router that has no usable PSC.Imajuku                                                        [Page 4]Internet Draft       draft-imajuku-ml-routing-01.txt   28 February 2002                        _______                       |       |                     __|  PSC  |__                    |  |_______|  |                    |            /|\                   \|/  _______   |                    |__|       |__|          __\     /|___|       |___|\            /    | |___|       |___| |   Fiber #1         ========| |___|  LSC  |___| |========                 | |___|       |___| |                  \|   |       |   |/                       |       |                       .       .                       .       .          __\     /|___|       |___|\            /    | |___|       |___| |   Fiber #N         ========| |___|       |___| |========                 | |___|       |___| |                  \|   |       |   |/                       |_______|3. Multi-layer routing aspects   In this section, we explain the routing aspects of a generic LSP+OLSP   multi-layer network comprising LSRs with only LSC and PSC+LSC.   In such multi-layer network, an LSP layer has LSP switching capability   through the combination of PSC-LSRs and PSC+LSC-LSRs. On the other    hand, an OLSP layer has OLSP switching capability through the    combination of LSC-LSRs and PSC+LSC-LSRs. Therefore, the LSR with    PSC+LSC shall have both layers' link states and network topology data   to realize both LSP and OLSP route selection. To provide the route    selection functionality, the LSR shall discriminate link state data    as to which layer they belong. Path route selection of LSPs and OLSPs   shall be done with reference to link the state data corresponding to   each layer.   The link state of an existing OLSP within the multi-layer GMPLS    network can be advertised as a point to point link by using    conventional Router LSA in the case of OSPF. This enables the    conventional IP routers, which are connected to the multi-layer GMPLS   network, to realize an IP network plane topology within the network.Imajuku                                                        [Page 5]Internet Draft       draft-imajuku-ml-routing-01.txt   28 February 2002   Alternatively, the link state of existing OLSPs can be advertised in    conformance with the concept of FA-LSPs [LSP-HIER]. The OLSP can be    identified as the links forming "forwarding adjacency" (FA) between    LSRs connected by the OLSP. The corresponding LSA of the OLSP    (FA-OLSP) shall contain the interface switching capability    descriptor, which indicates the OLSP being terminated by PSCs, and   information about this LSA is used to configure LSP layer network    topology. The forwarding of IP packets or LSPs shall be done by using   the next-hop database created from this network topology data.   The link state of existing fiber-links can be advertised by conforming   to the concept of TE extension to routing protocols [TE-OSPF]   -[TE-ISIS]. The fiber links connected to LSRs are identified as    TE-links that forms "routing adjacency" between LSRs. The    corresponding LSA of the TE-Fiber Link shall contain the interface    switching capability descriptor, which indicates the fiber link being   terminated by LSCs, and information about this LSA is used to    configure OLSP layer network topology. The routing of OLSPs shall be    done by using the next-hop database created from this network    topology data.   Also, these LSRs with integrated PSC+LSC switching capabilities    shall be required to advertise resource information in terms of    switching capability. The reservation capability of the integrated   switching node capability shall be varied to match the state of    resource utilization as discussed in the previous section. The route    of OLSPs can be calculated by the selection of LSCs that have OLSP    forwarding or termination capability and fiber links that have    unreserved wavelength channels.   Thus, the LSR can have multi-layer routing capability that    enables IP packet forwarding routes to be constructed considering    both existing OLSP and fiber-link state. If the unused bandwidth of    each OLSP is insufficient, a new OLSP can be automatically set-up in   response to an IP-traffic surge or LSP setup calls. This means that    the LSR can realize the IP-centric flexible Photonic network    essential to the next generation large capacity backbone network.4. Enhancements to interface switching capabilities descriptor   The draft of [GMPLS-OSPF] defines the Interface Switching Capability Imajuku                                                        [Page 6]Internet Draft       draft-imajuku-ml-routing-01.txt   28 February 2002   Descriptor with a sub-TLV of the Link TLV with type 15. The length    is the length of the value field in octets.   The Switching Capability (Switching Cap) field contains one of the    following values:           1     Packet-Switch Capable-1 (PSC-1)           2     Packet-Switch Capable-2 (PSC-2)           3     Packet-Switch Capable-3 (PSC-3)           4     Packet-Switch Capable-4 (PSC-4)           51    Layer-2 Switch Capable  (L2SC)           100   Time-Division-Multiplex Capable (TDM)           150   Lambda-Switch Capable   (LSC)           200   Fiber-Switch Capable    (FSC)   If there is no Interface Switching Capability Descriptor for an    interface, the interface is assumed to be packet-switch capable    (PSC-1).   Interface Switching Capability Descriptors present a new constraint    for LSP path computation.    The detail extensions to Interface Switching Capability Descriptor   for integrated PSC/LSC LSR will be discussed in the next version of    this document.   The Switching Cap field for integrated multi-layer LSRs: TBD.   The format of the value field: TBD.5.
