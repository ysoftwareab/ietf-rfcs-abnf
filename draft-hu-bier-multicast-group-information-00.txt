1.  Introduction

   Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)[I-D.ietf-bier-architecture]
   proposes an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding
   through a "BIER domain" without requiring intermediate routers to
   maintain any multicast related per-flow state.  BIER also does not
   require any explicit tree-building protocol for its operation.  BIER
   accomplishes this by addressing each of the targeted egress router in
   a bit mask in the BIER header.  A multicast data packet enters a BIER
   domain at a "Bit-Forwarding Ingress Router" (BFIR), and leaves the
   BIER domain at one or more "Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers" (BFERs) .
   The BIER header is encapsulated in the BFIR and decapsulated in the
   BFER.  Each BIER Forwarding Router (BFR) is assigned and uniquely
   identified by a BFR-prefix which is a routable ipv4 or ipv6 address.
   Each BIER egress (BFER) router needs a BFR-Identifier (1..65535) in
   addition to BFR-prefix.  To accomplish forwarding in a BIER network,
   ingress router needs to know the list of egress routers to which the
   flow is supposed be multicasted.

   This document proposes a method to solve the issue.  The ISIS or OSPF
   protocol is extended for a BFER to announce its supported multicast
   group address.  A new TLV (BIER-GROUP-ADDRESS TLV) is defined to
   carry the multicast group address for a BFER and encapsulated as the
   BIER data payload.  When BFER receives a new multicast group through
   IGMP/MLD protocol, it sends the BIER data payload with the new
   multicast group address information to all the other edge BFRs to
   announce this new multicast group information in the BIER domain.

2.  Multicast Group Address Announcement Mechanism

   In order to improve the IGP (ISIS or OSPF protocol) stability, the
   multicast group address information is encapsulated and carried as
   the BIER data payload rather than IGP protocol directly.  The
   protocol field in in the MPLS BIER header
   encapsulation[I-D.ietf-bier-mpls-encapsulation] is coded (7, to be
   assigned by IANA) to indicated that the payload is the multicast

   group address information.  The structure is as following (take the
   MPLS encapsulation as the example):


       +-----------+-----------+-----------------------------------+
       |MPLS header|BIER header|Multicast group address information|
       +-----------+-----------+-----------------------------------+
        Figure 1  Mutlicast Group Address Information Encapsulation

   The multicast group address information is formatted as TLV (section
   3) and filled in LSP or LSA in the BFER.  The BFER sends the BIER
   data payload with the multicast group address information to all the
   other edge BFRs in the BIER domain.  When the BFIR receives the
   multicast group address information, it keeps and maintains the
   multicast group and BFR-prefix entries in the local, which is to
   guide the multicast flow forwarding.

3.  BIER-GROUP-ADDRESS LV

   The format of BIER-GROUP-ADDRESS TLV is specified in figure 2.


   +--------------+
   |    Type      |
   +--------------+--------------+
   |           Length            |
   +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------+
   |Res|mutlicast group address type|Number of multicast Group address |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |             Multicast Group address (1)                           |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                        ...                                        |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |             Multicast Group address (i)                           |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |             Multicast Group address (n)                           |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
                      Figure 2 BIER-GROUP-ADDRESS TLV

   The description for each field is as following:

      Type: 8 bits.

      Length: 16 bits, the whole length for this tlv.

      Res: 8 bits, it is reserved for future use.

Internet-Draft            BIER multicast group             November 2015


      Multicast Group address type: 8 bits, it indicates the type for
      the multicast group address.  If it is 1, the multicast group
      address is IPv4 address, while if 2, the multicast group address
      is IPv6 address.

      Number of multicast group address: 16 bits, the number for the
      multicast group address.

      Multicast Group address[i]: the multicast group addresses for the
      BFER to be announced.

4.  ISIS Extension

   If the IGP is ISIS protocol in the BIER domain, the detailed format
   of Mutlicast Group Address Information is as figure 3.

   The label is MPLS-BIER label, and the S filed is 1(the end of the
   MPLS stack) in the MPLS header.

   All the Bitstring fields in the BEIR header is All-Edge-BFRs
   (0xFFFF).  The protocol fields is 7(to be assigned by IANA) to
   indicate that that the payload of BIER is the multicast group
   information payload.  The multicast group information payload is
   formatted as ISIS protocol.  The multicast group information TLV is
   filled in the ISIS LSP.  We named this ISIS LSP as MGAA-LSP
   (Multicast Group Address Announcement) to difference with the common
   ISIS LSP.  While the flooding and synchronization mechanism is
   similar with the common ISIS LSP.
