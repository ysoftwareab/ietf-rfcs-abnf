        Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) Gap Analysis
                   <draft-bi-supa-gap-analysis-03.txt>

Abstract

   As operators struggle to optimize their network for different 
   applications while maximizing network resources usage, there's 
   growing business pressure to minimize operational tasks and the 
   deployment time of new services. New automation paradigms are meant 
   to help reach these goals, including the optimization of network 
   functions through application control. This control could be signaled 
   directly by an application, through a proxy or orchestrated in a 
   centralized manner. The purpose of SUPA is to develop a methodology 
   by which network services can be managed using standardized policy 
   rules. SUPA will focus in the first phase on inter-datacenter traffic 
   management as part of the distributed data center use case, including 
   the automated provisioning of site-to-site virtual private networks 
   of various types.This memo analyses the current state of the art of 
   the industries in IETF and outside IETF.

INTERNET DRAFT                     SUPA Gap Analysis        May 19, 2015


1.  Introduction 

   Network operators, including Internet Service Providers, Datacenters 
   operators and others, are under constant pressure to optimize the 
   usage of their installed network resources while maintaining high 
   availability, complexity and deploying new services at an 
   ever-increasing pace. The introduction of new paradigms aims at 
   reducing these efforts, optimized network resource usage and minimize 
   operational overhead. Such a new paradigm is the deployment of 
   automated network configuration and optimization through the use of 
   two complementary mechanisms that are software abstractions to 
   simplify monitoring and control operations and the increase in 
   programmatic control over the configuration and operation of such 
   networks. Policy-based management can be used to combine these two 
   mechanisms into an extensible framework. 

   Management applications would benefit from a view of the network that 
   is adapted to their needs and from a policy framework that is 
   efficient and simple to use. Several organizations have started 
   working on protocols and models to be used between controllers and 
   network devices, either physical ones or virtualized. This work 
   started some years ago in a number of different organizations and has 
   spawned a large amount of interest in the networking community. 
   However the definition of interfaces between controllers and 
   applications, the so-called "northbound" side, has seen a lot less 
   progress during the same time. There's a need for management 
   applications to interface with controllers in a simple and elegant 
   way. For this purpose, applications require a way to express their 
   requirements in the form of simple policy statements applied to 
   network elements. These network elements should be as simplified 
   (abstracted) as possible for their manipulation by the application. 
   The responsibility of providing an abstract and simple view adapted 
   to each application need is the burden of the controller. The goal of 
   the Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) group is to develop 
   a methodology by which network services can be managed and automated 
   by using a set of information policy model and how these model can 
   map to YANG-based service and policy data models. It also focus on 
   how to communicate these policy models. SUPA will focus in the first 
   phase on inter- datacenter traffic management as part of the 
   distributed data center use case, including the set of information 
   models required to construct an extensible, policy-based framework. 
   These information models will lead to a set of core YANG data models 
   for a policy-based management framework to monitor and control 
   network services. 


2.  Scope and target for SUPA 

   SUPA introduces the concepts of multi-level (multiple levels of 
   abstraction) and multi-technology (e.g., IP, VPNs, MPLS) network 
   abstractions to address the current separation between development 
   and deployment operations. Multiple levels of abstraction enable

INTERNET DRAFT                     SUPA Gap Analysis        May 19, 2015

   common concepts present in different technologies and implementations 
   to be represented in a common manner. This facilitates using diverse 
   components and technologies to implement a network service. The 
   following standard generic YANG-based service and policy data models 
   are within the scope of SUPA working group: o model of the physical 
   and virtual network topology including the resources (e.g., data rate 
   or latency of links) and operational parameters needed to support 
   service deployment over the network topology. o model of the network 
   service (e.g., VPNs) and the network resources required by the 
   network service to be correctly deployed and executed on the physical 
   and/or virtual topology. o model of policy rules for managing the 
   network service and mapping services dynamically to the network 
   topology and network resources. Using the above models, service 
   specific policy data models will be derived from a generic policy 
   model, ensuring that policies have a common structure and can be 
   easily reused as managed objects. 


3.  Related work within the IETF 


3.1.  I2RS Working Group  

   They are not working on interconnection of data centers and 
   considering multi-tenant environment where having a possibility that 
   each tenant control (config, modify, etc.) its whole network that 
   might be physically located on different data centers simply without 
   even the need to involve in its complex communication processes. In 
   other word, SUPA wants to serve a user a service and the interaction 
   to a user is also important. This is not true for I2RS as it focuses 
   on the processes and uses programmable synchronize interfaces to 
   transfer states to and out of the internet routing systems. This is 
   true that I2RS WG also uses the Yang model, however, the model 
   introduced in [yang-i2rs] is so general and not only specific to use 
   cases defined in I2RS. In other word, for I2RS, yang model can help a 
   network controller to understand the topology of the whole network 
   and compare it with what it has and update the topology as needed. 
   Therefore, the general model introduced in [yang-i2rs] can also be 
   used as a base for SUPA. 


3.2.  L3SM Working Group  

   This working group focuses on communication of operators and 
   customers by allowing customers to configure the network elements via 
   layer 3 VPN technology. The proposal is very specific about using 
   layer 3 VPN technology via MPBGP. This group also wants to use Yang 
   model to be able to configure network devices. 

   The differences of this group with SUPA is as followings: 

   - SUPA proposes a generic proposal for various VPN technologies like 
   L2VPN, L3VPN and composite VPNs. Moreover, the proposed framework is

INTERNET DRAFT                     SUPA Gap Analysis        May 19, 2015

   flexible enough to meet the requirement of any of the existing or 
   upcoming VPN technologies. 

   - L3SM is more inclined towards MPLS/BGP VPN usecase but SUPA does 
   not focus on a specific use case. 

   - L3SM focus only on configuration and has no provision for 
   monitoring but SUPA provides service monitoring flexibility. 

   - L3SM charter did not explain anything about having a network 
   controller and only focuses on device configuration via a L3VPN. In 
   other word, customers might need to have different L3SM to configure 
   different devices. While in SUPA, a management system would allow a 
   customer to configure all or any selected devices concurrently via a 
   network control. 

   The result of L3SM might be able to feed SUPA with their model to 
   support policy information exchange in Layer 3 and SUPA might want to 
   extend their model to use for SUPA-specific purposes. 


3.3.  ALTO Working Group 

   The ALTO working group defined an architecture for exposing topology 
   information, more specifically the cost of paths through an 
   infrastructure, as defined in [RFC7285]. ALTO services are able to 
   provide network maps defined as groups of endpoints. Endpoints are 
   providers-defined entities and can therefore represent any 
   granularity of network, from the physical to groups of networks 
   following similar paths or restrains. Although this model can 
   represent different levels of abstraction at multiple granularities, 
   it's not clear if it could be adapted easily for other purposes than 
   providing cost maps in the context of ALTO. The ALTO model is meant 
   to be used outside of the trust domain of an ISP toward external 
   clients. 


3.4.  TEAS Working Group 

   The Traffic Engineering Architecture and Signaling working group is 
   responsible of MPLS-based Traffic Engineering, in other words the 
   control of traffic flows in an MPLS network. It covers YANG models 
   for a traffic engineering database, in coordination with other 
   working groups (I2RS) providing YANG models for network topologies. 


3.5.  BESS Working Group 

   The BGP Enabled Services working groups aims at providing a protocol 
   for the provisioning of L3VPN and L2VPN solutions based on BGP. This 
   includes BGP-enabled solutions for datacenter networking and 
   extensions to BGP-enabled solution to support Service Function 
   Chaining. The working group is also chartered to work on on BGP

INTERNET DRAFT                     SUPA Gap Analysis        May 19, 2015

   extensions to YANG models and data models for BGP-enabled services. 


3.6.  SFC Working Group 

   The Service Function Chaining (SFC) working group defines a mechanism 
   where traffic is classified before going through an ordered set of 
   services. The set of services is a definite and ordered group of 
   instances defining a service function path. More than one instance 
   may exist for each service in order to allow for load-balancing. A 
   YANG definition for SFC is already proposed in [sfc-yang] and has 
   been subject to an early implementation in Open Daylight. This 
   interface and its model, as currently defined, is an abstraction 
   limited to the scope of service chains. 


3.7.  NVO3 Working Group 

   The NVO3 group proposes a way to virtualize the network edge for 
   datacenters in order to be able to move virtual instances without 
   impacting their network configuration. This is realized through a 
   centrally controlled overlay layer-3 network, as described in draft- 
   lasserre-nvo3-framework. At first sight, there doesn't seem to be an 
   overlap between this work and what is being proposed in SUPA. This 
   type of architecture could support a virtual tenant model similar to 
   what is proposed in Open Daylight, but does not offer policing or new 
   models for applications to use. 


3.8.  ACTN Proposed Working Group 

   The ACTN proposed work, as described in [actn] framework, has two 
   main goals, the abstraction of multiple optical transport domains 
   into a single controller offering a common abstract topology and the 
   splitting of that topology into abstract client views, which are 
   usually a fraction of the complete network. The ACTN work is 
   therefore about unification of several physical controllers in a 
   virtual one and also about the segmentation, isolation and sharing of 
   network resources. The ACTN work is not explicitly about policies, 
   but some level of policing is applied in the creation of a client 
   view and the way it interacts with the virtual controller beneath. 
   One point where overlap may exist with some of the work proposed in 
   SUPA is in the definition of multiple levels of abstract topologies.

4.1.  TM Forum 

   The TM Forum (a.k.a., the TeleManagement Forum) develops standards 
   and best practices, research, and collaborative programs focused on 
   digital business transformation. It consists of three major programs:

   1) Agile Business and IT 

   2) Customer Centricity (experience) 

   3) Open Digital Ecosystem 

   Of these, the ZOOM (Zero-touch Orchestration, Operations, and 
   Management) project, located in the Agile Business and IT project, is 
   the main sub-project in this area that is of interest to SUPA. 

   Within ZOOM, the Foundational Studies project contains work on an 
   information model and management architecture that are directly 
   relevant to SUPA. The Information Model, Policy, and Security working 
   groups are involved in this work. 

   The ZOOM information model updates the existing Shared Information 
   and Data (SID) information model to add support for the management of 
   physical and virtual infrastructure, event- and data-driven systems, 
   policy management (architecture and model), metadata for describing 
   and prescribing behavior that can support changes at runtime, and 
   access control. 

   The policy information model defines event-condition-action (ECA), 
   declarative (intent-based), utility function, and promise policies. 
   The work in draft-strassner-supa-generic-policy-info-model-01 is 
   based on this work. It currently extends the ECA model and provides 
   additional detail not currently present in ZOOM; the next version of 
   this draft will do the same for declarative policies. 

   There is currently no plan to use the utility function and promise 
   policies. 

   Finally, it should be noted that the data model work planned for SUPA 
   is not currently planned for the ZOOM project. 


4.2.  MEF 

   The MEF (originally named the Metro Ethernet Forum) develops 
   architecture, service and management specifications related to 
   Carrier Ethernet (CE). The CE architecture includes the definition of 
   several interfaces specific to CE like the User Network Interface 
   (UNI) and External Network Network Interface (ENNI). Specifications 
   developed in this space include the definitions of CE services, CE 
   service attributes, Ethernet Access Services, Class of Service, OAM 
   and Management interfaces, Service Activation and Test. 

   The more recent vision of the MEF related to the future of networking 
   is described as The Third Network and includes plans to develop 
   Lifecycle Service Orchestration with APIs for existing network, NFV 
   and SDN implementations enabling Agile, Assured and Orchestrated

   Services. This stage of the MEF activity is now in early phases with 
   focus on architectural work. 

   The MEF has developed a number of Information and Data Models, and 
   has recently started a project that used YANG to model and manage the 
   services covered by the MEF. Although the MEF has created quite 
   rigorous definitions of these services, these are transport 
   technology specific, and they do not include and rely on policies. 


4.3.  Open Daylight 

   Open Daylight network controller implements a number of models 
   through its service abstraction Layer (MD-SAL) based on draft IETF 
   Yang models. Few of the below mentioned Open Daylight projects 
   provides policy abstraction and better flexibility to the user. 


4.3.1.  Network Intent Composition (NIC) 

   Network Intent Composition project aims at providing better 
   flexibility and high-level interface for the specification of 
   policies. The intents-based interface would provide a high level of 
   abstraction easy to formulate by an application developer and 
   completely detached from the underlying implementation details. By 
   making intents portable and composable, the project aims at making 
   intents a more scalable approach than existing interfaces. 


4.3.2.  Group Policy 

   The group-based policy project defines an application-centric policy 
   model for Open Daylight that separates information about application 
   connectivity requirements from information about the underlying 
   details of the network infrastructure. 


4.4.  Open Networking Foundation 

   The ONF created a group responsible of defining northbound 
   interfaces, but this hasn't lead to the publication of standards in 
   this area so far. A blog entry on the ONF web site showed an interest 
   in using the principle of intents at ONF, but no details were 
   provided on the status of this project. The membership of this group 
   being closed in nature, the status of current draft proposals is not 
   known. 


4.5.  OpenStack 

   OpenStack software controls large pools of compute, storage, and 
   networking resources throughout a datacenter, managed through a 
   dashboard or via the OpenStack API. OpenStack works with popular

   enterprise and open source technologies making it ideal for 
   heterogeneous infrastructure. Few of the below mentioned OpenStack 
   projects provides policy abstraction and better flexibility to the 
   user. 


4.5.1.  Group-Based Policies 

   The Group-Based Policies project for OpenStack Neutron is built 
   around entities assembled in Endpoints Groups (EPG) that provide or 
   consume Contracts. Such Contracts are hierarchical entities 
   containing policy rules. A first version was released in January 
   2015, based on the Juno release. This type of approach is more 
   relational than declarative, but could be used to describe a large 
   amount of possible scenarios. It has the advantage of providing a 
   relatively simple policy model that covers a large applicability. 
   From an OpenStack point of view, the scope of GBP is limited to 
   networking within the Neutron module. 


4.5.2.  Congress 

   The Congress project within OpenStack provides a way to formulate 
   complex policies using the Datalog language, a derivate of Prolog. 
   Datalog is entirely declarative and first-order logic, which gives it 
   interesting properties, such as providing the same result no matter 
   the order in which the statements are made. The language allows for 
   the definition of types and for active enforcement or verification of 
   the policies. Using Datalog also allows Congress to take advantage of 
   the significant body of knowledge and experience relating to 
   declarative languages and their implementation. The Congress policies 
   aim at manipulating objects exposed by multiple OpenStack modules and 
   is therefore larger in scope than network policying only. The only 
   drawback of this approach lies in its potentially large computational 
   complexity, which could limit its ability to react in real time fast 
   events such as those relating to the network. 


4.6.  The NEMO Project  

   The NEMO project is a research activity aiming at defining a simple 
   declarative framework for networking. The NEMO syntax is not based on 
   an existing language and covers the basic elements for network 
   manipulation such as nodes, links and flows. The NEMO project has 
   been successfully demonstrated at IETF-91, along with a companion 
   graphical user interface, and this work now being proposed as the 
   base for a new group called Intent-Based NEMO (IBNEMO) within the 
   IETF. 


4.7.  The Floodlight Project  

   The Floodlight is an openflow enabled SDN controller. it uses another

INTERNET DRAFT                     SUPA Gap Analysis        May 19, 2015

   open source project called Indigo to support openflow and manage 
   southbound devices. Indigo agent also supports abstraction layer to 
   make it easy to integrate with physical and virtual switches. It 
   supports configuration of abstraction layer so that it can configure 
   openflow in hybrid mode. 


4.8.  The ONOS Project  

   The ONOS is a SDN controller. It supports abstraction for both 
   southbound and northbound interfaces. This is because NFV used in 
   ONOS can reduce CaPex because each service can be virtualized, but it 
   increases OpEx as service providers now have to contend with 
   increased management complexity due to the management and 
   orchestration of a large numbers of VMs on commodity servers, the 
   management of network function software on the VMs and how VMs must 
   be interconnected based on subscriber's service contract. This is 
   why, ONOS uses Network Function as a Service (NFaaS) that not only 
   virtualized the components and Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) but 
   also introduces an abstractive unit for a collection of VMs and their 
   interconnecting network(s). Being able to create and manipulate these 
   units, rather than handling individual components, significantly 
   simplifies operation. NFaaS manipulates these units in the enhanced 
   form of a service. 


5.  Discussion 

   The ongoing projects outside of the IETF (see Section 4) demonstrate 
   that there is a need to develop service level abstractions and 
   policies that govern their implementation and mapping to the 
   underlying network infrastructure. While different approaches are 
   currently being prototyped, it is desirable from an operator's 
   perspective and of likely also of strategic importance from an IETF's 
   perspective to host work in this area within the IETF with a goal to 
   drive progress towards a common standardized solution in this space. 
   Generic policy driven service management is not directly worked on by 
   existing IETF working groups. Several working groups provide 
   technology specific mechanisms (TEAS, BESS, ACTN) that ideally can be 
   leveraged by a generic policy driven service management solution. 
   Other working groups provide key building blocks (e.g., the generic 
   topology work recently chartered in the I2RS working group) or they 
   look at specific aspects such as the chaining of data plane traffic 
   manipulation functions (SFC) or the movement of virtual machines 
   (NVO) or the export of typically aggregated topology information to 
   distributed file sharing or streaming applications (ALTO).
