1.  Status of this Memo

This document is an Internet Draft.  Internet Drafts are
working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF), its Areas, and its Working Groups. Note that other
groups may also distribute working documents as Internet
Drafts.

Internet Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six
months. Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted
by other documents at any time.  It is not appropriate to use
Internet Drafts as reference material or to cite them other
than as a "working draft" or "work in progress."

2.  Abstract

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base
(MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-
based internets.  In particular, it defines objects for
managing the the interface attributes defined in the
Integrated Services Model.  Comments should be made to the
Integrated Services Working Group, int-serv@isi.edu.

This memo does not, in its draft form, specify a standard for
the Internet community.

3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
components.  They are:

o    RFC 1441 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
     describing and naming objects for the purpose of
     management.

o    RFC 1213 defines MIB-II, the core set of managed objects
     for the Internet suite of protocols.

o    RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other
     architectural aspects of the framework.

o    RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network
     access to managed objects.

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the
purpose of experimentation and evaluation.


3.1.  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation
One (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object
object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an
administratively assigned name.  The object type together with
an object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific
instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we often
use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
object type.


4.  Overview

4.1.  Textual Conventions

Several new data types are introduced as a textual convention
in this MIB document.  These textual conventions enhance the
readability of the specification and can ease comparison with
other specifications if appropriate.  It should be noted that
the introduction of the these textual conventions has no

effect on either the syntax nor the semantics of any managed
objects.  The use of these is merely an artifact of the
explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of one of
these methods are always encoded by means of the rules that
define the primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or
the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual
conventions which are adopted merely for the convenience of
readers and writers in pursuit of the elusive goal of clear,
concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

The new data types are ...

4.2.  Structure of MIB

The MIB is composed of the following sections:
     Integrated Services
          Interface Attributes Table
          Interface Flows Table
          Notifications
