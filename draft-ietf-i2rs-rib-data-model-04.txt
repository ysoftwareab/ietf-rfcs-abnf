1.  Introduction

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS)
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] provides read and write access to the
   information and state within the routing process that exists inside
   the routing elements, this is achieved via the protocol message
   exchange between I2RS clients and I2RS agents associated with the
   routing system.  One of the functions of I2RS is to read and write
   data of Routing Information Base (RIB).
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-usecase-reqs-summary] introduces a set of RIB use
   cases.  The RIB information model is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model].

Internet-Draft                   RIB DM                    November 2015


   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020][RFC6991] data model for the
   RIB that satisfies the RIB use cases and aligns with the RIB
   information model.

1.1.  Definitions and Acronyms

   RIB: Routing Information Base

   Information Model (IM): An abstract model of a conceptual domain,
   independent of a specific implementation or data representation.

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node and "*"
      denotes a "list" and "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  Model Structure

   The following figure shows an overview of structure tree of the ietf-
   i2rs-rib module.  To give a whole view of the structure tree, some
   details of the tree are omitted.  The relevant details are introduced
   in the following sub-sections.

2.1.  RIB Capability

   RIB capability negotiation is very important because not all of the
   hardware will be able to support all kinds of nexthops and there
   should be a limitation on how many levels of lookup can be
   practically performed.  Therefore, a RIB data model MUST specify a
   way for an external entity to learn about the functional capabilities
   of a network device.

   At the same time, nexthop chains can be used to specify multiple
   headers over a packet, before that particular packet is forwarded.
   Not every network device will be able to support all kinds of nexthop
   chains along with the arbitrary number of headers which are chained
   together.  The RIB data model MUST provide a way to expose the
   nexthop chaining capability supported by a given network device.

   This module uses the feature and if-feature statements to achieve
   above capability negotiation.

2.2.  Routing Instance and Rib

   A routing instance, in the context of the RIB information model, is a
   collection of RIBs, interfaces, and routing protocol parameters.  A
   routing instance creates a logical slice of the router and can allow
   multiple different logical slices; across a set of routers; to
   communicate with each other.  And the routing protocol parameters
   control the information available in the RIBs.  More detail about
   routing instance can be found in Section 2.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model].

   For a routing instance, there will be multiple RIBs.  Therefore, this
   model uses "list" to express the RIBs.  The structure tree is shown
   as following figure.

   +--rw routing-instance
      +--rw name              string
      +--rw interface-list* [name]
      |  +--rw name if:interface-ref
      +--rw router-id?        yang:dotted-quad
      +--rw lookup-limit?     uint8
      +--rw rib-list* [name]
         +--rw name            string
         +--rw rib-family      rib-family-def
         +--rw ip-rpf-check?   boolean
         +--rw route-list* [route-index]

2.3.  Route

   A route is essentially a match condition and an action following that
   match.  The match condition specifies the kind of route (e.g., IPv4,
   MPLS, MAC, Interface etc.) and the set of fields to match on.

   According to the definition in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model], a
   route MUST associate with the following attributes:

   o  ROUTE_PREFERENCE: See Section 2.3 of
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model].

   o  ACTIVE: Indicates whether a route is fully resolved and is a
      candidate for selection.

Internet-Draft                   RIB DM                    November 2015


   o  INSTALLED: Indicates whether the route got installed in the FIB.

   In addition, a route can associate with one or more optional route
   attributes(e.g., route-vendor-attributes).

   For a RIB, there will have a number of routes, so the routes are
   expressed as a list under a specific rib.  Each rib has its own route
   list.

2.4.  Nexthop

   A nexthop represents an object resulting from a route lookup.  As
   illustrated in Section 2.4 of [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model], to
   support various of use cases (e.g., load balance, protection,
   multicast or the combination of them), the nexthop is modelled as a

   multi-level structure and supports recursion.  The first level of the
   nexthop includes the following four types:

   o  Base: The "base" nexthop is the foundation of all other nexthop
      types.  It includes the follow basic nexthops:

      *  nexthop-id

      *  IPv4 address

      *  IPv6 address

      *  egress-interface

      *  egress-interface with IPv4 address

      *  egress-interface with IPv6 address

      *  egress-interface with MAC address

      *  logical-tunnel

      *  tunnel-encap

      *  tunnel-decap

      *  rib-name

   o  Chain:Provide a way to perform multiple operations on a packet by
      logically combining them.

   o  Load-balance: Designed for load-balance case where it normally
      will have multiple weighted nexthops.

   o  Protection: Designed for protection scenario where it normally
      will have primary and standby nexthop.

   o  Replicate: Designed for multiple destinations forwarding.

   The structure tree of nexthop is shown in the following figures.

2.5.  RPC Operations

   This module defines the following RPC operations:

   o  rib-add: It is defined to add a rib to a routing instance.  A name
      of the rib, address family of the rib and whether the RPF check is
      enabled are passed as the input parameters.  The output is the
      result of the add operation:

      *  true - success;

      *  false - failed; when failed, the i2rs agent may return the
         specific reason that causes the failure.

   o  rib-delete: It is defined to delete a rib from a routing instance.
      When a rib is deleted, all routes installed in the rib will be
      deleted.  A name of the rib is passed as the input parameter.  The
      output is the result of the delete operation:

      *  true - success;

      *  false - failed; when failed, the i2rs agent may return the
         specific reason that causes the failure.

   o  route-add: It is defined to add a route or a set of routes to a
      rib.  A rib name, the route prefix(es), route attributes, route
      vendor attributes, nexthop and whether return failure detail are
      passed as the input parameters.  Before calling the route-add rpc,
      it is required to call the nh-add rpc to create and/or return the
      nexthop identifier.  The output is a combination of the route
      operation states that include:

      *  success-count: the numbers of routes that are successfully
         added;

      *  failed-count: the numbers of the routes that are failed to be
         added;

      *  failure-detail: shows the specific failed routes that failure
         reason.

   o  route-delete: It is defined to delete a route or a set of routes
      from a rib.  A name of the rib, the route prefix(es) and whether
      return failure detail are passed as the input parameters.  The
      output is combination of the route operation states that include:

      *  success-count: the numbers of routes that are successfully
         deleted;

      *  failed-count: the numbers of the routes that are failed to be
         deleted;

      *  failure-detail: shows the specific failed routes that failure
         reason.

   o  route-update: It is defined to update a route or a set of routes.
      A rib name, the route prefix(es), or route attributes, or route
      vendor attributes, or nexthop are passed as the input parameters.
      The match conditions can be either route prefix(es), or route
      attributes, or route vendor attributes, or nexthop.  The update
      actions include: update the nexthop, update the route attributes,
      update the route vendor attributes.  The output is combination of
      the route operation states that include:

      *  success-count: the numbers of routes that are successfully
         updated;

      *  failed-count: the numbers of the routes that are failed to be
         updated;

      *  failure-detail: shows the specific failed routes that failure
         reason.

   o  nh-add: It is defined to add a nexthop to a rib.  A name of the
      rib and a nexthop are passed as the input parameters.  The network
      node is required to allocate a nexthop identifier to the nexthop.
      The outputs include the result of the nexthop add operation.

      *  true - success; when success, a nexthop identifier will be
         returned to the i2rs client.

      *  false - failed; when failed, the i2rs agent may return the
         specific reason that causes the failure.

   o  nh-delete: It is defined to delete a nexthop from a rib.  A name
      of a rib and a nexthop or nexthop identifier are passed as the
      input parameters.  The output is the result of the delete
      operation:

      *  true - success;

      *  false - failed; when failed, the i2rs agent may return the
         specific reason that causes the failure.

2.6.  Notifications

   Asynchronous notifications are sent by the RIB manager of a network
   device to an external entity when some event triggers on the network
   device.  A RIB data-model MUST support sending 2 kind of asynchronous
   notifications.

   1.  Route change notification:

   o Installed (Indicates whether the route got installed in the FIB) ;

   o Active (Indicates whether a route is fully resolved and is a
   candidate for selection) ;

   o Reason - E.g.  Not authorized

   2.  Nexthop resolution status notification

   Nexthops can be fully resolved nexthops or an unresolved nexthop.

   A resolved nexthop has adequate level of information to send the
   outgoing packet towards the destination by forwarding it on an
   interface of a directly connected neighbor.

   An unresolved nexthop is something that requires the RIB manager to
   determine the final resolved nexthop.  For example, in a case when a
   nexthop could be an IP address.  The RIB manager would resolve how to
   reach that IP address, e.g. by checking if that particular IP is
   address reachable by regular IP forwarding or by a MPLS tunnel or by
   both.  If the RIB manager cannot resolve the nexthop, then the
   nexthop remains in an unresolved state and is NOT a suitable
   candidate for installation in the FIB.

   The structure tree of notifications is shown in the following figure.
