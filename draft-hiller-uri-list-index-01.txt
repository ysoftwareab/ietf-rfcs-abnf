Abstract 
    
   This draft extends the schema of the resource list specified in 
   draft-ietf-simple-xcap-list-usage-01 by defining an index attribute 
   (membercode).  It also defines two MIME types that refer to subsets 
   of a resource list. These MIME types can be used to identify subsets 
   of a resource list for use with SIP requests.

1. Problem Statement 
    
   The SIPPING WG is developing mechanisms to by which a SIP request can 
   target a list of recipient URIs (a URI-list). These URI-lists may be 
   transported either within the associated request (a request-contained 
   list) or stored externally and referenced by the request [URI-LIST] 
   [LIST-CONF]. This specification extends the second case by allowing a 
   request to reference a subset of the URIs contained in a referenced 
   URI-list. This is achieved my extending the schema of the URI-list so 
   that each list element is associated with a locally-unique index 
   value, and extending the referencing syntax to allow a request to 
   carry a list reference and a set of index values indicating elements 
   to be selected from the referenced list.  
    
   For wireless, this avoids the need for a mobile to have to send a SIP 
   request multiple times over the air, thereby conserving spectrum and 
   extending battery lifetime, both of which are valuable goals in 
   wireless.  The 3G wireless technology cdma2000 has various transport  
   mechanisms, some of which only support rather low data rates. The 
   cdma2000 mechanism "1X-RTT", has an effective payload data rate of 
   8500bps after various physical overhead are deducted from the 
   absolute physical bit rate.  So, for 1X-RTT, a kilobyte long SIP 
   request causes one second of over-the-air transport latency, which is 
   a problem for some services, such as push-to-talk conferencing that 
   have tight latency requirements.  
    
   Yet another cdma2000 transport mechanism called "short data burst", 
   has severe message length restrictions; for example based on radio 
   engineering considerations, the PPP frames should be under 100 bytes 
   total including PPP overhead.  This mechanism also features low data 
   rates as the 1X-RTT mechanism mentioned above.  
    
   For these cdma2000 transport mechanisms, it is highly desirable to 
   minimize the length of SIP requests especially for those destinations 
   that are contacted frequently.  Based on this, it is desirable to 
   minimize the number of bytes required to transport the URI-lists in 
   the SIP requests, and therefore to define a highly compact means to 
   convey a URI List in SIP Request bodies.  This draft proposes an 
   index to elements of the resource list schema [RF].  The index 
   results in shorter SIP requests for SIP applications that require

   transport over lower data rate and/or message length restricted 
   cdma2000 transport mechanisms.  
    
2. General Solution 
2.1. Summary 
    
   This draft adds an attribute called "membercode" to elements of the 
   resource list schema of [RL] and defines two MIME [MIME-1] types to 
   convey (represent) a URI List [URI-LIST] [LIST-CONF] in the body of a 
   SIP request. The MIME types are based on the identity of the user's 
   resource list along with indices (the membercodes) that have been 
   previously stored in a user's resource list. Both MIME types require 
   that the server hosting the list assign membercodes to all URIs of 
   the user's Resource List entries. The MIME type conveys identity of 
   the resource list and the membercodes associated with the URIs on a 
   URI List.  The MIME instance replaces the actual URI elements, 
   thereby saving many bytes and reducing over-the-air transport 
   latency.  
    
   The membercode is a non-negative integer that is unique within a 
   given resource list.  The maximum value (size) of the membercode 
   should be on the order of the number of lists and list entries of the 
   resource list.  
    
2.2. Membercode Attribute Management 
    
   The document draft-ietf-simple-xcap-list-usage-01 [RL] states the 
   requirements on XCAP for a client to manipulate the resource list.  
    
   An XCAP client does not include the membercode attribute when it 
   creates or modifies a resource list element, as the membercode is 
   optional.  Instead the server creates a unique membercode when the 
   resource is created.  The server leaves the membercode unchanged when 
   a list or list element is modified. The addition of an index to the 
   resource list is transparent to XCAP.  Having the presence list 
   server assigns membercodes to resource list elements avoids conflicts 
   and/or race conditions that could arise due to multiple users 
   creating or modifying resource list elements.  
    
   Users of the resource list may subscribe for updates to receive 
   presence notifications [RL-NOTIFY] that carry the assigned 
   membercodes.  Also, users may access the resource list directly via 
   XCAP to learn the membercode attributes created.  Otherwise, a means 
   to synchronize the membercodes in user devices must be provided by 
   means outside the scope of this document. 
    
   In order for a users learn the values of membercode attributes via 
   presence notifications [RL-NOTIFY] the user has to subscribe for 
   notifications and the resource list's "subscribe" flag MUST be set).  
     
2.3. MIME Types

                            URI List Index               February 2004 
 
 
   The first MIME, application/resource-lists-indices, is a list of the 
   membercodes of the elements of a URI list.    
    
   The second MIME, application/resource-lists-bitmap, is a bit map of 
   the membercodes of the elements of the URI list.  In the latter case, 
   a bit set at location 'x' in the bit map corresponds to a membercode 
   of value '2**x".  
    
   MIME bodies may be further compressed with procedures that are part 
   of a general SIGCOMP [SIGCOMP] "program".   
    
3. Definition of Membercode Attribute for Resource List 
    
   As explained above, this draft adds an attribute called "membercode" 
   to elements of the resource list schema of [RL]. , The resulting 
   schema is as follows:

4. IANA Considerations 
    
   The document draft-camarillo-uri-list-00.txt defines a "list" 
   parameter for SIP and SIPS URIs that points to an XCAP resource list. 
   This document defines two MIME types to which the list parameter may 
   point and is consistent with [MIME-2] and [MIME-4]. 
    
4.1. Index List 
    
   The MIME Content-Type is "application/resource-lists-indices" and is 
   a list of membercodes separated by white space. The presence of an 
   membercode in the list means that the associated URI is to be 
   included on the URI list.  The MIME type includes the resource list 
   URI.   
    
   The URI and membercode are encoded as is encoded in UTF-8. The 
   membercode attributes, which are numbers, are coded as hex digits. 
   The URI and member codes are separated by a white space. The exact 
   efficiency of the encoding of membercodes is less important because a 
   SIGCOMP program can compress these digits, which are represented as 
   characters, to binary numbers. 
    
   The ABNF [ABNF] for this MIME type is as follows. 
    
   resource-lists-indices = (resource-list-URI SP *(membercode SP))

        resource-list-URI = SIP-URI   
                          ; this is an SIP URI to the resource list 
                          ; see [SIP] 
             membercode = *HEXDIG 
                          ; the member code is on the list if the 
                          ; associated URI is on the URI list

4.2. Bit Map MIME 
 
   The MIME Content-Type is an "application/resource-lists-bitmap", and 
   is a binary string whose individual bit positions correspond to the 
   values of membercodes.  A bit set in the bit map means the URI 



  
Hiller           Standards Track - Expires June 2004                6 
                            URI List Index               February 2004 
 
 
   associated with the membercode whose value matches that bit position 
   is on the URI list. The MIME type includes the resource list URI.  
    
   If the bit map has fewer bits than the maximum value of the 
   membercode, then URIs corresponding to "missing" bit positions are 
   not included in the URI list.  If the bit map has bit positions that 
   do not correspond to membercodes or more bits than the maximum value 
   possible of the membercode, then the "extra" bits MUST be ignored. 
    
   The URI and bitmap are encoded as is encoded in UTF-8. The bit flags 
   of the membercode are coded as four bits to a hex digit. Any bits in 
   hex digit for which membercodes do not exist are set to zero, which 
   occurs if the number of bits in the bit map isn't a multiple of four. 
   The bit map positions correspond to the power of two in the resulting 
   hex number.  Therefore, in string of hex digits, the most significant 
   bit of the most significant hex digit represents the highest value 
   membercode of the resource list.   
    
   The bit map MIME type's ABNF is as follows: 
    
    resource-lists-bitmap = (resource-list-URI  *membercode-hex) 
        resource-list-URI = SIP-URI 
                          ; this is a SIP URI to the resource list 
                          ; see [SIP] 
    
          membercode-hex = HEXDIG   
                          ; a bit position M of the membercode-hex N  
                          ; is set if a URI on the URI list  
                          ; has a membercode of value 2**(4*N+M) 
                          ; where N starts at 1 (so the first character  
                          ; is M=1) and M is value of 2**M in the hex   
                          ; character (so the least bit is 2**0).  
    
    
   Information per [MIME-4] is as follows:

5. Security Considerations 
    
   The index proposed herein is a way to access a user on the resource 
   list, which is used to invite people to calls, etc. However, the 
   security of the index is no more nor less important than any other 
   data already contained on the list, and therefore, this document does 
   not imply additional security concerns or considerations.
