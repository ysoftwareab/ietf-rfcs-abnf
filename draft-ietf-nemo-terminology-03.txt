Internet-Draft              NEMO Terminology               February 2005


1.  Introduction

   Network mobility support is concerned with managing the mobility of
   an entire network.  This arises when a router connecting a network to
   the Internet dynamically changes its point of attachment to the fixed
   infrastructure, thereby causing the reachability of the entire
   network to be changed in relation to the fixed Internet topology.
   Such a network is referred to as a mobile network.  Without
   appropriate mechanisms to support network mobility, sessions
   established between nodes in the mobile network and the global
   Internet cannot be maintained after the mobile router changes its
   point of attachment.  As a result, existing sessions would break and
   connectivity to the global Internet would be lost.

   This document defines the specific terminology needed to describe the
   problem space, the design goals [4], and the solutions for network
   mobility support.  This terminology aims to be consistent with the
   usual IPv6 terminology [7] and the generic mobility-related terms
   already defined in the Mobility Related Terminology [1] and in the
   Mobile IPv6 specification [2].  Some terms introduced in this
   document may only be useful for defining the problem scope and
   functional requirements of network mobility support.

   Note that the abbreviation NEMO stands for either "a NEtwork that is
   MObile" or "NEtwork MObility".  The former (see Section 2.1) is used
   as a noun, e.g.  "a NEMO" meaning "a mobile network".  The latter
   (see Section 7) refers to the concept of "network mobility" as in
   "NEMO Basic Support" and is also the working group's name.

   Section 2 introduces terms to define the architecture while terms
   needed to emphasize the distinct functionalities of those
   architectural components are described in Section 3.  Section 4,
   Section 5 and Section 6 describe terms pertaining to nested mobility,
   multihoming and different configurations of mobile networks at home,
   respectively.  The different types of mobility are defined in
   Section 7.  The last section lists miscellaneous terms which do not
   fit in any other section.

2.  Architectural Components

   A mobile network is composed of one or more mobile IP-subnets
   (NEMO-link) and is viewed as a single unit.  This network unit is
   connected to the Internet by means of one or more mobile routers
   (MRs).  Nodes behind the MR (referred to as MNNs) primarily comprise
   fixed nodes (nodes unable to change their point of attachment while
   maintaining ongoing sessions), and possibly mobile nodes (nodes able
   to change their point of attachment while maintaining ongoing
   sessions).  In most cases, the internal structure of the mobile

   network will be stable (no dynamic change of the topology), but this
   is not always true.

   Figure 1 illustrates the architectural components involved in network
   mobility and defined in the following paragraphs: Mobile Router (MR),
   NEMO-link, Mobile Network Node (MNN), "ingress interface", "egress
   interface", and Correspondent Node (CN).  The other terms "access
   router" (AR), "Fixed Node (FN)", "Mobile Node (MN)", "home agent"
   (HA), "home link" and "foreign link" are not terms specific to
   network mobility and thus are defined in [1].

          Figure 2: Single Mobile Subnetwork on a Foreign Link

   At the network layer, MRs get access to the global Internet from the
   Access Router(s) (AR) on a visited link.  An MR maintains the
   Internet connectivity for the entire mobile network.  A given MR has
   one or more egress interface and one or more ingress interface.  When
   forwarding a packet to the Internet, the packet is transmitted
   upstream through one of the MR's egress interfaces to the AR; when
   forwarding a packet from the AR down to the mobile network, the
   packet is transmitted downstream through one of the MR's ingress
   interfaces.

2.1  Mobile Network (NEMO)

   As defined in [1]:

   An entire network, moving as a unit, which dynamically changes its
   point of attachment to the Internet and thus its reachability in the
   topology.  The mobile network is composed of one or more IP-subnets
   and is connected to the global Internet via one or more Mobile
   Routers (MR).  The internal configuration of the mobile network is
   assumed to be relatively stable with respect to the MR.

   Re-arrangement of the mobile network and changing the attachment
   point of the egress interface to the foreign link are orthogonal
   processes and do no affect each other.

2.2  Mobile Router (MR)

   As defined in [1]:

   A router capable of changing its point of attachment to the Internet,
   moving from one link to another link.  The MR is capable of
   forwarding packets between two or more interfaces, and possibly
   running a dynamic routing protocol modifying the state by which it

Internet-Draft              NEMO Terminology               February 2005


   does packet forwarding.

   An MR acts as a gateway between an entire mobile network and the rest
   of the Internet, and has one or more egress interface and one or more
   ingress interface.  Packets forwarded upstream to the rest of the
   Internet are transmitted through one of the MR's egress interfaces;
   packets forwarded downstream to the mobile network are transmitted
   through one of the MR's ingress interfaces.

2.3  Egress Interface (E-face)

   As defined in [1]:

   The network interface of an MR attached to the home link if the MR is
   at home, or attached to a foreign link if the MR is in a foreign
   network.

2.4  Ingress Interface (I-face)

   As defined in [1]:

   The interface of an MR attached to a link inside the mobile network.

2.5  Mobile Network Prefix (MNP)

   As defined in [1]:

   A bit string that consists of some number of initial bits of an IP
   address which identifies the entire mobile network within the
   Internet topology.  All nodes in a mobile network necessarily have an
   address containing this prefix.

2.6  NEMO-link

   A link (subnet) which comprises, or is located within, the mobile
   network.

2.7  Mobile Network Node (MNN)

   As defined in [1]:

   Any node (host or router) located within a mobile network, either
   permanently or temporarily.  A Mobile Network Node may either be a
   fixed node (LFN) or a mobile node (VMN or LMN).

2.8  Correspondent Node (CN)

   Any node that is communicating with one or more MNNs.  A CN could be

   either located within a fixed network or within another mobile
   network, and could be either fixed or mobile.

   Within the term Mobile Network Node (MNN), we can distinguish between
   Local Fixed Nodes (LFN), Visiting Mobile Nodes (VMN) and Local Mobile
   Nodes (LMN).  The distinction is a property of how different types of
   nodes can move in the topology and is necessary to discuss issues
   related to mobility management and access control; however it does
   not imply that network mobility or host mobility should be handled
   differently.  Nodes are classified according to their function and
   capabilities with the rationale that nodes with different properties
   may have different requirements.

3.1  Local Fixed Node (LFN)

   A fixed node (FN), either a host or a router, that belongs to the
   mobile network and is unable to change its point of attachment while
   maintaining ongoing sessions.  Its address is located within an MNP.

3.2  Visiting Mobile Node (VMN)

   Either a mobile node (MN) or a mobile router (MR), assigned to a home
   link that doesn't belong to the mobile network and which is able to
   change its point of attachment while maintaining ongoing sessions.  A
   VMN that is temporarily attached to a NEMO-link (used as a foreign
   link) obtains an address on that link (i.e.  the address is taken
   from an MNP).

Internet-Draft              NEMO Terminology               February 2005


3.3  Local Mobile Node (LMN)

   Either a mobile node (MN) or a mobile router (MR), assigned to a home
   link belonging to the mobile network and which is able to change its
   point of attachment while maintaining ongoing sessions.  Its address
   is taken from an MNP.  Figure 4 illustrates a LMN changing its point
   of attachment within the mobile network.

3.4  NEMO-enabled node (NEMO-node)

   A node that has been extended with network mobility support
   capabilities as described in NEMO specifications.

   In NEMO Basic Support [3], only the MR and the HA are NEMO-enabled.

   For NEMO Extended Support, details of the capabilities are not known
   yet at the time of this writing, but NEMO-enabled nodes may be
   expected to implement some sort of Route Optimization.

4.  Nested Mobility Terms

   Nested mobility occurs when there is more than one level of mobility,
   i.e.  when a mobile network acts as an access network and allows
   visiting nodes to attach to it.  There are two cases of nested
   mobility:

   o  The attaching node is a single VMN (see figure 4).  For instance,
      when a passenger carrying a mobile phone gets Internet access from
      the public access network deployed on a bus.

   o  The attaching node is a MR with nodes behind it, i.e.  a mobile

      network (see figure 5).  For instance, when a passenger carrying a
      PAN gets Internet access from the public access network deployed
      on a bus.

   For the second case, we introduce the following terms:

4.1  Nested Mobile Network (nested-NEMO)

   A mobile network is said to be nested when a mobile network
   (sub-NEMO) is attached to a larger mobile network (parent-NEMO).  The
   aggregated hierarchy of mobile networks becomes a single nested
   mobile network.

4.2  root-NEMO

   The mobile network at the top of the hierarchy connecting the
   aggregated nested mobile networks to the Internet.

4.3  parent-NEMO

   The upstream mobile network providing Internet access to another
   mobile network further down the hierarchy.

4.4  sub-NEMO

   The downstream mobile network attached to another mobile network up
   in the hierarchy.  It becomes subservient of the parent-NEMO.  The
   sub-NEMO is getting Internet access through the parent-NEMO and does
   not provide Internet access to the parent-NEMO.

4.5  root-MR

   The MR(s) of the root-NEMO used to connect the nested mobile network
   to the fixed Internet.  Was referred to as "TMLR" (Top-Level Mobile
   Router) in former versions of this document.

4.6  parent-MR

   The MR(s) of the parent-NEMO.

4.7  sub-MR

   The MR(s) of the sub-NEMO which is connected to a parent-NEMO

5.  Multihoming Terms

   Multihoming, as currently defined by the IETF, covers
   site-multihoming [8] and host multihoming.  We enlarge this
   terminology to include "multihomed mobile router" and "multihomed
   mobile network".  The specific configurations and issues pertaining
   to multihomed mobile networks are covered in [5].

5.1  Multihomed host or MNN

   A host (e.g.  an MNN) is multihomed when it has several IPv6
   addresses to choose between, i.e.  in the following cases when it is
   either:

      Multi-prefixed: multiple prefixes are advertised on the link(s)
      the host is attached to, or

      Multi-interfaced: the host has multiple interfaces to choose
      between, on the same link or not.


5.2  Multihomed Mobile Router

   From the definition of a multihomed host, it follows that a mobile
   router is multihomed when it has several IPv6 addresses to choose
   between, i.e.  in the following cases when the MR is either:

      Multi-prefixed: multiple prefixes are advertised on the link(s) an
      MR's egress interface is attached to, or.

      Multi-interfaced: the MR has multiple egress interfaces to choose
      between, on the same link or not.

5.3  Multihomed Mobile Network (multihomed-NEMO)

   A mobile network is multihomed when either a MR is multihomed or
   there are multiple MRs to choose between, or multiple prefixes are
   advertised in the mobile network.

              Figure 8: Single NEMO-link with Multiple MRs


5.4  Nested Multihomed Mobile Network

   A nested mobile network is multihomed when either a root-MR is
   multihomed or there are multiple root-MRs to choose between or
   multiple prefixes are advertised in the nested mobile network.

5.5  Illustration

   Figure 7 and Figure 8 show two examples of multihomed mobile
   networks.  Figure 9 shows two independent mobile networks.  NEMO-1 is
   single-homed to the Internet through MR1.  NEMO-2 is multihomed to
   the Internet through MR2a and MR2b.  Both mobile networks offer
   access to visiting nodes and networks through an AR.

   Let's consider the two following nested scenarios in Figure 9:

   Scenario 1: What happens when MR2a's egress interface is attached to
   AR1 ?



      *  NEMO-2 becomes subservient of NEMO-1

      *  NEMO-1 becomes the parent-NEMO for NEMO-2 and the root-NEMO for
         the aggregated nested mobile network

Internet-Draft              NEMO Terminology               February 2005


      *  NEMO-2 becomes the sub-NEMO

      *  MR1 is the root-MR for the aggregated nested mobile network

      *  MR2a is a sub-MR in the aggregated nested mobile network

      *  NEMO-2 is still multihomed to the Internet through AR1 and ARz

      *  The aggregated nested mobile network is not multihomed, since
         NEMO-2 cannot be used as a transit network for NEMO-1

   Scenario 2: What happens when MR1's egress interface is attached to
   AR2 ?



      *  NEMO-1 becomes subservient of NEMO-2

      *  NEMO-1 becomes the sub-NEMO

      *  NEMO-2 becomes the parent_NEMO for NEMO-1 and also the
         root-NEMO for the aggregated nested mobile network

      *  MR2a and MR2b are both root-MRs for the aggregated nested
         mobile network

      *  MR1 is a sub-MR in the aggregated nested mobile network

      *  NEMO-1 is not multihomed

      *  The aggregated nested mobile network is multihomed

6.  Home Network Model Terms

   The terms in this section are useful to describe the possible
   configurations of mobile networks at the home.  Such configurations
   are detailed in [6]

6.1  Home Link

   The link attached to the interface at the Home Agent on which the
   Home Prefix is configured.  The interface can be a virtual interface,
   in which case the Home Link is a Virtual Home Link.

6.2  Home Network

   The Network formed by the application of the Home Prefix to the Home
   Link.  With NEMO, the concept of Home Network is extended as
   explained below.

6.3  Home Address

   With Mobile IPv6, a Home Address is derived from the Home Network

Internet-Draft              NEMO Terminology               February 2005


   prefix.  This is generalized in NEMO, with some limitations: A Home
   Address can be derived either from the Home Network or from one of
   the Mobile Router's MNPs.

6.4  Mobile Home Network

   A Mobile Network that also serves as a Home Network.  The MR that
   owns the MNP acts as a Home Agent for it.

6.5  Distributed Home Network

   A Distributed Home Network is advertised by several sites that are
   geographically distributed and meshed using tunnels in a VPN fashion.

6.6  Mobile Aggregated Prefix

   An aggregation of Mobile Network Prefixes.

6.7  Aggregated Home Network

   The Home Network associated with a Mobile Aggregated Prefix.  This
   Aggregation is advertised as a subnet on the Home Link, and thus used
   as Home Network for Nemo purposes.

6.8  Extended Home Network

   The network associated with the aggregation of one or more Home
   Network(s) and Mobile Network(s).  As opposed to the Mobile IPv6 Home
   Network that is a subnet, the extended Home Network is an aggregation
   and is further subnetted.

6.9  Virtual Home Network

   The Home Network associated with a Virtual Network.  The Extended
   Home Network and the Aggregated Home Network can be configured as
   Virtual Home Network.

7.  Mobility Support Terms

7.1  Host Mobility Support

   Host Mobility Support is a mechanism which maintains session
   continuity between mobile nodes and their correspondents upon the
   mobile host's change of point of attachment.  It can be achieved
   using Mobile IPv6 or other mobility support mechanisms.

Internet-Draft              NEMO Terminology               February 2005


7.2  Network Mobility Support (NEMO Support)

   Network Mobility Support is a mechanism which maintains session
   continuity between mobile network nodes and their correspondents upon
   a mobile router's change of point of attachment.  Solutions for this
   problem are classified into NEMO Basic Support, and NEMO Extended
   Support.

7.3  NEMO Basic Support

   NEMO Basic Support is a solution to preserve session continuity by
   means of bi-directional tunneling between MRs and their HAs much like
   what is done with Mobile IPv6 [2] for mobile nodes when Routing
   Optimization is not used.  Only the HA and the MR are NEMO-enabled.
   The solution for doing this is solely specified in [3].

7.4  NEMO Extended Support

   NEMO Extended support is to provide the necessary optimization,
   including routing optimization between arbitrary MNNs and CNs.

7.5  MRHA Tunnel

   The bi-directional tunnel between a Mobile Router and its Home Agent.

Appendix A.  Change Log From Earlier Versions

   The discussions behind the changes in the lattest versions of this
   documents are reflected in the "issue" web page:
   http://www.sfc.wide.ad.jp/~ernst/nemo/

A.1  Changes since draft-nemo-terminology-02.txt

   - Issue A18: Redesigned  Figure 3

   - Issue A22: The follolwing comment added in the definition of
   "Mobile Network": "Re-arrangement of the mobile network and changing
   the attachment point of the egress interface to the foreign link are
   orthogonal processes and do no affect each other." (as suggested by
   TJ)

   - Issue A23: Clarified in definition of "NEMO-link" that the link may
   comprise the mobile network: "A link (subnet) which comprises, or is
   located within, the mobile network." (as suggested by TJ)

   - Issue A24: Removed definition of CR (as suggested by TJ)

   - Issue A25: Removed the miscellaneous terms "Idle MNN" and "Idle
   mobile network" (as suggested by TJ)

   - Issue A26: English brush up.

A.2  Changes since draft-nemo-terminology-01.txt

   - Shorten abstract.

   - Reshaped some figures.

   - LFN, VMN, LMN: said that the node is able/unable to move while
   maintaining/not maintaining ongoing sessions.  Text already
   appareared in the document, but not in the definition itself.

   - NEMO-enabled: said that MR and HA are the only NEMO-enabled nodes
   in NEMO Basic Support

   - Removed "NEMO-enabled MR" as this definition is self-contained into
   "NEMO-enabled Node"

   - Rephrased the definition of "multihomed host", "multihomed router",
   "multihomed mobile network" and removed the terms multi-addressed and
   multi-sited, multi-rooted-NEMO, etc.  Such terms were not so useful,
   and somewhat too long.

   - Added the case "multiple MNPs are advertised" to the definition of
   mobile network

   - Copy-pasted terms defined from RFC 3753 so that the document is
   self-contained

   - Updated References
