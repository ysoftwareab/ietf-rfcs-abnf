1. Abstract

   In order to deploy a residential telephone service at very large
   scale across different domains, it is necessary for trusted elements
   owned by different service providers to exchange trusted information
   that conveys customer-specific information and expectations about
   the parties involved in the call. This document describes extensions
   to the Session Initiation Protocol (RFC2543) for supporting the
   exchange of customer information and billing information between
   trusted entities in the architecture described in <draft-dcsgroup-
   sip-arch-01.txt>.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [2].


3. Introduction

   In order to deploy a residential telephone service at very large
   scale across different domains, it is necessary for trusted elements
   owned by different service providers to exchange trusted information
   that conveys billing information and expectations about the parties
   involved in the call.

   There are many billing models used in deriving revenue from
   telephony services today. Charging for telephony services is tightly
   coupled to the use of network resources. It is outside the scope of
   this document to discuss the details of these numerous and varying
   methods.

   A key motivating principle of the DCS architecture described in [3]
   is the need for network service providers to be able to control and
   monitor network resources; revenue may be derived from the usage of
   these resources as well as from the delivery of enhanced services
   such as telephony. Furthermore, the DCS architecture recognizes the
   need for coordination between call signaling and resource
   management.  This coordination ensures that users are authenticated
   and authorized before receiving access to network resources and
   billable enhanced services.

                    SIP Proxy-to-Proxy Extensions          March 2000


   DCS-Proxies, as defined in [3], have access to subscriber
   information and act as policy decision points and trusted
   intermediaries along the call signaling path. Edge routers provide
   the policy enforcement mechanism and also capture and report usage
   information.  Edge routers need to be given billing information that
   can be logged with Record Keeping or Billing servers.  The DCS
   Proxy, as a central point of coordination between call signaling and
   resource management, can provide this information based on the
   authenticated identity of the calling and called parties. Since
   there is a trust relationship among DCS Proxies, they can be relied
   upon to exchange trusted billing information pertaining to the
   parties involved in a call.

   For these reasons, it is appropriate to consider defining SIP header
   extensions to allow DCS Proxies to exchange information during call
   setup. It is the intent that the extensions would only appear on
   trusted network segments, should be inserted upon entering a trusted
   network region, and removed before leaving trusted network segments.
   Rules for inserting and removing headers exchanged only between
   proxies are for further study.

4. Justification for proxy-to-proxy information

   Significant amounts of information is retrieved by an originating
   proxy in its handling of a connection setup request from a user
   agent.  Such information includes location information about the
   subscriber (essential for emergency services calls), billing
   information, and station information (e.g. coin operated phone). In
   addition, while translating the destination number, information such
   as the local-number-portability office code is obtained and will be
   needed by all other proxies handling this call.

   For Usage Accounting records, it is necessary to have an identifier
   that can be associated with all the event records produced for the
   call. Call-ID cannot be used as such an identifier since it is
   selected by the originating user agent, and may not be unique among
   all past calls as well as current calls. Further, since this
   identifier is to be used by the service provider, it should be
   chosen in a manner and in a format that meets the service provider's
   needs.

   Billing information may not necessarily be unique for each user
   (consider the case of calls from an office all billed to the same
   account).  Billing information may not necessarily be identical for
   all calls made by a single user (consider prepaid calls, credit card
   calls, collect calls, etc).  It is therefore necessary to carry
   billing information separate from the calling and called party
   identification.  Furthermore, some billing models call for split-
   charging where multiple entities are billed for portions of the
   call.

   The addition of two SIP General Header Fields allows for the capture
   of billing information and billing identification for the duration

   of the call. Alternative techniques such as multi-part attachments
   will not coexist with encrypted messages.

   It is the intent that the billing extensions would only appear on
   trusted network segments, and MAY be inserted by a DCS Proxy in
   INVITE requests entering a trusted network segment, and removed
   before leaving trusted network segments.


5. Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234 [4].

   The proposed additional headers are:

   BILLING-INFO

   The Billing-info general header identifies a subscriber account
   number of the payer, and other information necessary for accurate
   billing of the service.  This header MUST only used between Proxies.

       Billing-Info   = "Billing-Info" ":" hostport "<" Acct-Data ">"

       Acct-Data      = 1*unreserved | (1*unreserved "," Acct-Data)

   The hostport specifies a record keeping server. Acct-Data is
   arbitrary format data understood only by the record keeping server.
   The Acct-Data may contain a security key needed to send event
   records to the record keeping server.

   BILLING-ID

   The Billing-ID general header contains an identifier that can be
   used by an event recorder to associate multiple usage records,
   possibly from different sources, with a billable account.  This
   header MUST only be used between Proxies.

        Billing-ID        = "Billing-ID" ":" 1*unreserved


   A proposed implementation of billing ID is a string made up of DCS
   proxy's IP address, timestamp, and sequence number.

   GATE-LOCATION

   The Gate general header contains the location and identifier of a
   Gate associated with the IP flow for this call.  This information is
   needed for gate coordination, as described in [3].

        Gate              = "Gate" ":" hostport "/" Gate-ID
                                   [";" Gate-Key ";" Gate-CipherSuite]

                    SIP Proxy-to-Proxy Extensions          March 2000


        Gate-ID           = 1*alphanum

        Gate-Key          = 1*alphanum

        Gate-CipherSuite  = token


   REQUEST-URI

   The Request-URI is extended to allow a phone number to contain
   augmented information, which may include the local-number-
   portability office code. The telephone-subscriber syntax defined in
   <draft-antii-telephone-url-12.txt> allows augmented information to
   be exchanged between proxies. As such, if the host is an Internet
   telephony device, the SIP URL user field MAY encode a phone number
   or an augmented phone number using the telephone-subscriber syntax
   of <draft-antii-telephone-url-12.txt>.

   To semantically distinguish this form of host, the token user=phone
   is included, as in standard SIP.


6. Security Considerations

   The general headers and request URI extensions described in this
   draft MUST only be used between proxies, and MUST never be given to
   a user agent.

   Billing information is often considered sensitive and private
   information to the customers.  It is therefore necessary that the
   Proxies take precautions to protect this information from
   eavesdropping and interception.  Use of IPSec between Proxies is
   recommended.
