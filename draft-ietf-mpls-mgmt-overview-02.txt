Abstract

   An assortment of management Information Bases (MIBs) has
   been developed to help model and manage the various aspects
   of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks.  These
   MIBs are defined in separate drafts and RFCs that focus on
   the specific areas of responsibility of their MIBs.

   This memo describes the management architecture for MPLS
   and indicates the inter-relationships between the different
   MIBs used for MPLS network management.

1. Introduction

   This memo describes the Management Architecture for Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031]. In particular,
   it describes how the managed objects defined in various
   MPLS related Management Information Base (MIB) documents
   model different aspects of MPLS. Furthermore, this document
   explains the interactions and dependencies between each of
   these MIBs.

   For additional information, this draft also includes a
   brief note on MIBs produced by the Pseudo Wire Emulation
   Edge to Edge (pwe3), Provider Provisioned Virtual Private
   Network (ppvpn), Common Control and Measurement Plane
   (ccamp), and Internet Traffic Engineering (tewg) working
   groups.

   The draft begins with a brief outline of the SNMP
   framework.  This is not intended to be a complete reference
   on SNMP, but is provided to give context to the rest of the
   draft and to indicate reference material for readers that
   need to know more about SNMP.

   This draft does not propose any additions to the MPLS MIB
   framework, nor define any standards for the Internet
   community.  It is an informational draft.  In all cases,
   the reader is advised to turn to the draft or RFC that
   defines the MIB in question for further information.

   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list
   at mpls@uu.net.


2. Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the MPLS architecture
   document [RFC3031] and the following MPLS related MIBs:
   MPLS-TC_MIB [TCMIB], MPLS-LSR_MIB [LSRMIB], MPLS-TE_MIB
   [TEMIB], MPLS-LDP_MIB [LDPMIB], MPLS-FTN_MIB [FTNMIB], MPLS-
   LINK-BUNDLING_MIB [LBMIB], and PPVPN-MPLS-VPN_MIB [VPNMIB].

3. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five
   major components:

   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
      STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and
      STD 16, RFC 1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2,
      is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579
      [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

   -  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
      the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
      track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
      [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
      message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
      [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   -  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
      protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
      RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
      [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism
      described in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
   termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the
   MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.


4. An Introduction to the MPLS Working Group MIB Modules

   This section addresses the MIBs produced by the MPLS working group,
   namely MPLS-TC_MIB, MPLS-LSR_MIB, MPLS-TE_MIB, MPLS-LDP_MIB,
   MPLS-FTN_MIB, and MPLS-LINK-BUNDLING_MIB.  The rest of this section
   briefly describes the following:

   -  the MPLS Object Identifier (OID) tree structure and the
      position of different MPLS related MIBs on this tree;

   -  the purpose of each MIB module, what it can be used
      for, and how it relates to the other MIB modules.

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-mgmt-overview-02.txt        June 2002

4.1.  Structure of the MPLS MIB OID Tree

   The MPLS MIB OID tree has the following structure.

      transmission -- RFC1213_MIB [RFC1213]
        |
        +- mplsMIB (166?) -- MPLS-TC_MIB
        |    |
        |    +- mplsTCMIB (1) -- MPLS-TC_MIB
        |    |
        |    +- mplsLsrMIB (2) -- MPLS-LSR_MIB
        |    |
        |    +- mplsTeMIB (3) -- MPLS-TE_MIB
        |    |
        |    +- mplsLdpMIB (4) -- MPLS-LDP_MIB
        |    |
        |    +- mplsFTNMIB (5) -- MPLS-FTN_MIB
        ?
        +- linkBundlingMIB (TBD) -- LINK-BUNDLING_MIB

   Note: Some OID information is pending assignment by IANA and will
   be included in a later revision when this is available.


4.2.  MPLS-TC_MIB

   MPLS-TC_MIB defines textual conventions [RFC2579] and object
   identities that may be common to MPLS related MIB modules.  These
   conventions allow multiple MIB modules to use the same syntax and
   format for a concept that is shared between the MIB modules.

   For example, labels are a central part of MPLS and need to be
   presented in many of the MIB modules. The textual convention for
   representing an MPLS label is defined in MPLS-TC_MIB.

   All of the other MPLS MIBs import this MIB so that they can
   use one or more of the textual conventions it defines.


4.3.  MPLS-LSR_MIB

   MPLS-LSR_MIB describes managed objects for modeling a MPLS Label
   Switch Router (LSR).  This puts it at the heart of the management
   architecture for MPLS.

   This MIB module is used to model and manage the basic label
   switching behavior of an MPLS LSR.  It represents the label
   forwarding information base (LFIB) of the LSR and provides a view
   of the LSPs that are being switched by the LSR in question.

   Since basic MPLS label switching is common to all MPLS applications,
   this MIB is referenced by many of the other MPLS MIB modules.

   In general, MPLS-LSR_MIB provides a model of incoming labels on MPLS-
   enabled interfaces being mapped to outgoing labels on MPLS-enabled

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-mgmt-overview-02.txt        June 2002

   interfaces via a conceptual object called an MPLS cross-connect.
   MPLS cross-connect entries and their properties are represented in
   MPLS-LSR_MIB and are typically referenced by other MIB modules in
   order to refer to the underlying MPLS LSP.

   For example, MPLS-TE_MIB models traffic engineered tunnels.
   These tunnels map to one more underlying MPLS LSPs. MPLS-
   TE_MIB refers to the underlying LSP by pointing to cross-
   connect entries in MPLS-LSR_MIB.


4.4.  MPLS-LDP_MIB

   MPLS-LDP_MIB describes managed objects used to model and
   manage the MPLS Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
   [RFC3036].  LDP is one of the MPLS protocols used to
   distribute labels and establish LSPs.

   This MIB module allows a user to configure and monitor LDP
   sessions on an LSR.  The MIB module supports configuration
   of LDP to use IP, ATM and Frame Relay media.


4.5.  MPLS-TE_MIB

   MPLS-TE_MIB describes managed objects that are used to
   model and manage MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE) Tunnels.

   This MIB module is based around a table that represents TE
   tunnels that either originate from, traverse via or terminate
   on the LSR in question or.  The MIB module provides configuration
   and statistics objects needed for TE tunnels.


4.6.  MPLS-FTN_MIB

   MPLS-FTN_MIB describes managed objects that are used to
   model and manage the MPLS FEC-to-NHLFE (FTN) mappings that
   take place at an ingress LER.

   A Label Edge Router (LER) is an LSR placed at the edge of
   an MPLS domain and passes traffic into and out of the MPLS
   domain.  An ingress LER is responsible for classifying data
   and assigning it to a suitable LSP.

   This classification is done using Forwarding Equivalency
   Classes (FECs) that define the common attributes of data
   (usually packets) that will be treated in the same way.
   Once data has been classified it can be handed off to an
   LSP through the Next Hop Label Forwarding Entry (NHLFE).

   In the case of an IP-to-MPLS mapping, the FEC objects describe
   IP 5-tuples representing IP source and destination ranges, protocol
   ranges etc. Matching IP packets are mapped to an NHLFE that can
   either be an MPLS LSP or an MPLS TE tunnel.

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-mgmt-overview-02.txt        June 2002

4.7.  MPLS-LINK-BUNDLING_MIB

   MPLS-LINK-BUNDLING_MIB describes managed objects that are
   used to model and manage link bundling in an MPLS network.

   The link bundling feature is designed to aggregate one or
   more similar data channels between a pair of LSRs into a
   bundled link. The data channel is referred to as a TE link
   and is a sub-interface capable of carrying MPLS traffic
   engineered traffic.

   A link bundle is a sub-interface that bonds the traffic of
   a group of one or more TE links.


4.8.  MIB Interdependencies

   This section provides an overview of the relationship
   between the MPLS MIB modules described above.  More details
   of these relationships are given below once the MIB modules
   have been discussed in more detail.

   The arrows in the following diagram show a 'depends on'
   relationship.  A "MIB module A depends on MIB module B"
   relationship means that MIB module A uses a structure or
   textual convention defined in MIB module B, or that MIB
   module A contains a pointer (index or RowPointer) to an
   object in MIB module B.

   +---> MPLS-TC_MIB
   |          ^
   |          |
   |     MPLS-LSR_MIB <---+
   |                      |
   +<--- MPLS-LDP_MIB --->+
   |                      |
   +<--- MPLS-TE_MIB  --->+
   |          ^           |
   |          |           |
   +<--- MPLS-FTN_MIB --->+

   Thus:

   -  All the MPLS MIB modules depend on MPLS-TC_MIB.

   -  MPLS-LDP_MIB, MPLS-TE_MIB and MPLS-FTN_MIB contain
      references to objects in MPLS-LSR-MIB.

   -  MPLS-FTN_MIB contains references to objects in MPLS-
      TE_MIB.

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-mgmt-overview-02.txt        June 2002

4.9.  Dependencies on External MIBs

   With the exception of MPLS-TC_MIB, all the MPLS MIB modules
   have dependencies on the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].  They
   reference MPLS-capable interfaces in the Interfaces Table
   (ifTable) in this MIB.

   The Interfaces Group of MIB II defines generic managed
   objects for managing interfaces.  The MPLS MIBs contain
   media-specific extensions to the Interfaces Group for
   managing MPLS interfaces.

   The MPLS MIB modules assume the interpretation of the Interfaces
   Group to be in accordance with [RFC2863] which states that ifTable
   contains information on the managed resource's interfaces and that
   each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of a network interface
   is considered an interface.

   Thus, the MPLS interface is represented as an entry in ifTable.

   The inter-relation of entries in ifTable is defined by the
   Interfaces Stack Group defined in [RFC2863].


5. Tables, Scalars and Notifications in MPLS-LSR_MIB


5.1.  Tables

   MPLS-LSR_MIB contains the following tables.

   -  The interface configuration table (mplsInterfaceConfTable)
      is used for enabling MPLS on MPLS-capable interfaces.

   -  The in-segment (mplsInSegmentTable) and out-segment
      (mplsOutSegmentTable) tables are used to configure and monitor
      LSP segments carrying data into and out of the LSR, respectively.

   -  The cross-connect table (mplsXCTable) is used to
      associate in and out segments in order to form a cross-
      connect (i.e. to represent an LSP transiting the LSR).

   -  The label stack table (mplsLabelStackTable) allows the
      specification of multi-label stacks to be imposed on a
      given LSP at this LSR

   -  The Traffic Parameter table (mplsTrafficParamTable) is
      used to specify and record LSP related traffic parameters.

   -  The MPLS in-segment (mplsInSegmentPerfTable) and out-
      segment (mplsOutSegmentPerfTable) performance tables
      contain objects to measure the performance of LSPs.

   -  The MPLS interface performance table (mplsInterfacePerfTable) has
      objects to measure MPLS performance on a per-interface basis.

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-mgmt-overview-02.txt        June 2002

5.2.  Scalars

   Where tables in the MIB module have arbitrary indexes,
   scalars are provided to supply the next available index.
   This applies to mplsOutSegmentTable, mplsXCTable,
   mplsLabelStackTable and mplsTrafficParamTable.

   mplsMaxLabelStackDepth defines the maximum size of a
   imposed label stack supported at this LSR.

   mplsXCTrapEnable is used to enable and disable
   notifications from MPLS-LSR_MIB.


5.3.  Notifications

   MPLS-LSR_MIB can issue two notifications (if notifications
   are enabled).

   -  mplsXCUp reports when a cross-connect becomes active.

   -  mplsXCDown reports when a cross-connect becomes
   inactive.

6. Tables, Scalars and Notifications in MPLS-LDP_MIB


6.1.  Tables

   The tables in MPLS-LDP_MIB for configuring the LDP behavior
   of an LSR are as follows.

   -  The LDP Entity Table (mplsLdpEntityTable) provides a
      way to configure the LSR for using LDP.  There must be
      at least one LDP Entity for the LSR to support LDP.
      Each entry/row in this table represents a single LDP
      Entity.

   -  Several tables exist to help configure LDP's use of
      labels.  These are mplsLdpEntityConfGenericLabelRangeTable,
      mplsLdpEntityAtmParmsTable, mplsLdpEntityConfAtmLabelRangeTable,
      mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayParmsTable and
      mplsLdpEntityConfFrLabelRangeTable.  They are used to configure
      generic, ATM and Frame Relay labels as their names suggest.

   -  The LDP Peer Table (mplsLdpPeerTable) is a read-only table, that
      contains information about LDP Peers known to LDP Entities.

   -  The LDP Hello Adjacencies Table (mplsLdpHelloAdjacenciesTable) is
      a table of all adjacencies between all LDP Entities and all LDP
      Peers.

   -  Several tables exist to monitor and control LDP
      sessions.  The LDP Session Table (mplsLdpSessionTable)
      represents sessions between an LDP Entity and a Peer.
      The mplsLdpAtmSesTable and mplsLdpFrameRelaySesTable
      contain session information specific to ATM.

   -  The MPLS LDP Session Peer Address Table (mplsLdpSesPeerAddrTable)
      stores addresses learned after session initialization via Address
      Message advertisement.

   -  The LDP FEC Table (mplsLdpFecTable) represents the FEC (Forwarding
      Equivalence Class) Information associated with an LSP.

   -  MPLS-LDP_MIB has three mapping tables (mplsLdpSesInLabelMapTable,
      mplsLdpSesOutLabelMapTable and mplsLdpSesXCMapTable) which map the
      LDP MIB's representation of LDP sessions to the underlying LSR
      MIB's representation of the LSPs created by these sessions by
      pointing to mplsInSegmentTable, mplsOutSegmentTable and
      mplsXCTable, respectively.

   -  The LDP MIB's mplsXCsFecsTable shows the relationship between
      forwarding equivalence classes (FECs) and cross-connect entries
      by referring to entries in the LSR MIB's mplsXCTable.

   -  Statistics may be gathered through the LDP Entity
      Statistics Table (mplsLdpEntityStatsTable) and the LDP
      Session Statistics Table (mplsLdpSesStatsTable)

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-mgmt-overview-02.txt        June 2002

6.2.  Scalars

   Where tables in the MIB have arbitrary indexes, scalars are
   provided to supply the next available index.  This applies
   to the mplsLdpEntityTable and the mplsLdpFecTable.

   Two scalars exist to configure the LSR.  The LSR ID is set
   in mplsLdpLsrId, and the loop detection capabilities are
   reported in mplsLdpLsrLoopDetectionCapable

   The scalar mplsLdpSesUpDownTrapEnable is used to enable and
   disable notifications from MPLS-LDP_MIB.  There are also
   objects within the tables to control notifications.


6.3.  Notifications

   MPLS-LDP_MIB defines four notifications that a device can
   issue.

   -  mplsLdpInitSesThresholdExceeded is reported when the
      number of Session Initialization messages exceeds a
      configured threshold.

   -  mplsLdpPVLMismatch is issued if the Path Vector Limit
      for a configured Entity and Peer do not match.

   -  mplsLdpSessionUp and mplsLdpSessionDown report the
      transition of Session state.


6.4.  Dependencies Between MIB Module Tables

   The many tables in MPLS-LDP_MIB module are related as shown
   on the diagram below.  The arrows indicate a reference from
   one table to another.  Note that in many cases the
   reference is through an augmentation of the referenced
   table.

7. Tables, Scalars and Notifications in MPLS-TE_MIB


7.1.  Tables

   MPLS-TE_MIB contains the following tables.

   -  The Tunnel table (mplsTunnelTable) is used to configure
      and report MPLS tunnels.  Note that reporting of
      tunnels in this table at transit LSRs is optional.

   -  The Resource table (mplsTunnelResourceTable) is used to
      configure resources to be requested on this tunnel.
      The CRLDP resource table (mplsTunnelCRLDPResTable) is
      used to request additional resource details that are
      specific to tunnels signaled using CR-LDP.

   -  The routes requested, computed and actually used for a
      tunnel are found in the Tunnel Hop Table
      (mplsTunnelHopTable) Tunnel Computed Hop Table
      (mplsTunnelCHopTable) and Tunnel Actual Hop Table
      (mplsTunnelARHopTable).

   -  Statistics about the performance of tunnels may be
      gathered through the Tunnel Performance Table
      (mplsTunnelPerfTable).

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-mgmt-overview-02.txt        June 2002

7.2.  Scalars

   Where tables in the MIB have arbitrary indexes, scalars are
   provided to supply the next available index.  This applies
   to the mplsTunnelTable, the mplsTunnelResourceTable and the
   mplsTunnelHopTable.

   Two scalars exist to configure the support for MPLS tunnels
   on the LSR.  mplsTunnelTEDistProto lists the signaling
   methods and protocols supported.  mplsTunnelMaxHops defines
   the size of route that may be configured on the LSR.

   Two further scalars enhance the statistics on the LSR by
   counting the number of configured (mplsTunnelConfigured)
   and active (mplsTunnelActive) tunnels.

   The scalar mplsTunnelTrapEnable is used to enable and
   disable notifications from MPLS-TE_MIB.


7.3.  Notifications

   MPLS-TE_MIB defines four notifications that a device can
   issue.

   -  mplsTunnelUp and mplsTunnelDown report the transition
      of Tunnel state.

   -  Rerouting and re-optimization of Tunnels paths are
      reported by mplsTunnelRerouted and
      mplsTunnelReoptimized.


7.4.  Dependencies Between MIB Module Tables

   The tables in MPLS-TE_MIB are related as shown on the
   diagram below.  The arrows indicate a reference from one
   table to another.

8. Tables, Scalars and Notifications in MPLS-FTN_MIB


8.1.  Tables

   MPLS-FTN_MIB contains the following tables.

   -  The FEC to NHLFE Table (mplsFTNTable) defines the FEC
      to NHLFE rules to be applied to incoming packets, and
      the actions to be taken on matching packets.

   -  The FEC to NHLFE Map Table (mplsFTNMapTable) provides
      the capability to activate FTN rules defined in the
      mplsFTNTable on specific interfaces in the system.

   -  Performance statistics for FTN rules are found in the
      mplsFTNPerfTable.


8.2.  Scalars

   A single scalar (mplsFTNIndexNext) exists.  It is used to
   supply the next valid index into the mplsFTNTable.


8.3.  Notifications

   There are no notifications in this MIB.

9. Tables and Objects in MPLS-LINK-BUNDLING_MIB


9.1.  Tables

   MPLS-LINK-BUNDLING_MIB contains the following tables.

   -  The TE link table (teLinkTable) is used to specify TE
      links, including bundled links, and their generic
      traffic engineering parameters.

   -  The TE link descriptor table (teLinkDescriptorTable) is
      used to list the TE link descriptors.

   -  The TE link OSPF traffic engineering table
      (teLinkOspfTeTable) is used for configuring OSPF
      traffic engineering parameters associated with TE links.

   -  The shared risk link group (SRLG) table
      (teLinkSrlgTable) is used to specify the SRLGs
      associated with TE links.

   -  The TE link bandwidth table (teLinkBandwidthTable) is
      used to report priority-based bandwidth values
      associated with TE links.

   -  The data-bearing channel table
      (dataBearingChannelTable) is used to identify the data-
      bearing channels that are associated with the TE links
      and specify the data-bearing channel generic traffic
      engineering parameters.

   -  The data-bearing channel link descriptor table
      (dataBearingChannelDescriptorTable) is used to list the
      data-bearing channel link descriptors.

   -  The data-bearing channel bandwidth table
      (dataBearingChannelBandwidthTable) is used to report
      priority-based bandwidth values associated with data-
      bearing channels.


9.2.  Scalars

   A single scalar (linkBundlingTrapEnable) exists.  It is
   used to enable and disable notifications from the MIB from
   being issued by a device.


9.3.  Notifications

   A single notification is defined.

   -  linkBundleMismatch is generated when a mismatch of TE
      parameters between members of a bundled link is found.

10.   MIB Table Dependencies Between MPLS MIBs

   Section 4.8 gave an overview of how the MPLS MIB modules
   are related.  Now that the tables in the MIB modules have
   been introduced, it is possible to give a more detailed
   diagram of these relationships.

   MPLS-TC_MIB is left off the diagram since so many of the

11.   Related IETF MIB Modules

   This section describes the broad interactions between MIB
   modules produced by the pwe3, ppvpn, and ccamp working
   groups and the MPLS MIB modules.


11.1. pwe3 Working Group MIB Modules

   The pwe3 working group has produced a document [PWE3FW]
   that includes a description of the framework for PWE3 MIBs.
   Since the PWE3 architecture includes the use of MPLS as an
   emulated service and as a PSN service, the MPLS MIBs
   described above may be leveraged.  The pwe3 framework
   document describes the interactions between the MPLS MIBs
   and the PWE3 MIBs.


11.2. ppvpn Working Group MIB Modules

   At present, the ppvpn working group has not included a
   discussion of how the MPLS MIBs interact with the MIBs
   being produced by that working group.  The authors of this
   draft hope to make a forthcoming addition to the ppvpn
   framework document [PPVPNFW] detailing these interactions.
   At the moment, there is only a single MIB module [VPNMIB]
   produced which is discussed next.

11.2.1.  PPVPN-MPLS-VPN_MIB

   PPVPN-MPLS-VPN_MIB describes managed objects that are used
   to model and manage RFC2547bis MPLS VPNs [RFC2547Bis].
   This MIB module contains tables which model virtual routing
   forwarding entries (VRFs), as well as the interfaces
   associated with those VRFs.

11.2.1.1.    Position in the OID Tree

      transmission -- RFC1213_MIB
        |
        +- vpnMIB (TBD) -- PPVPN-MPLS-VPN_MIB

11.2.1.2.    Dependencies

   This MIB module currently has no direct dependencies to any
   of the MPLS MIB modules. This MIB module models MPLS VPN
   interfaces as entries in the Interfaces MIB's Interfaces
   Table (ifTable).  This MIB module may be modified in the
   future to import textual conventions from MPLS-TC_MIB.

Internet Draft     draft-ietf-mpls-mgmt-overview-02.txt        June 2002

11.3. ccamp Working Group MIBs

   At present, there are no MIBs produced by the ccamp working group
   that interact directly with the MPLS MIBs.  However, in the future,
   the existing MPLS MIBs will need to be extended and augmented to
   facilitate the technology being produced by this working group.
   Along with any MIBs produced by the ccamp working group, a separate
   ccamp-specific Management Framework document is expected to be
   issued describing the relationship between these MIBs and
   the existing MPLS (and other) MIBs.


12.   Traffic Engineering Working Group TE MIB

   The tewg has produced a traffic engineering MIB [TEWGMIB]
   containing objects for monitoring traffic engineered MPLS
   based tunnels at their ingress points.

   In many senses the tewg TE MIB contains the same information as
   MPLS-TE_MIB.  Both MIBs can be used to monitor MPLS tunnels.

   The tewg TE MIB was initially styled towards simple textual
   representation of information about tunnels.  This made it simple to
   implement as a read only MIB, displaying details of existing tunnels
   that were configured or established through other means.

   As write access has been added, the MIB continues to allow
   simple representations of tunnels.

   The price of this simplicity within the MIB, however, is an
   increased complexity in the Management Station or greater
   sophistication in the operator. It is necessary to apply
   parsing rules to text strings to in order to fully
   interpret or to configure tunnels.

   Many advanced features of MPLS tunnels are not included in this MIB.


12.1. Choosing Between TE MIBs Modules

   MPLS-TE_MIB should be used for a fully configurable high
   function implementation.  It provides objects for managing
   all features of MPLS Tunnels.

   The tewg TE MIB may be used for quick implementation or for
   non-complex situations.  It may be particularly suitable
   for read-only inspection of tunnels established by some
   other means (such as a CLI).


13.   Security Considerations

   This document describes the inter-relationships amongst the different
   MIBs relevant to MPLS management and as such does not have any
   security implications beyond those imposed by these MIBs themselves.
