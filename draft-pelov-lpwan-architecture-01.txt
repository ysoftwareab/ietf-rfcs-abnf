1.  Introduction

   The IETF LPWAN WG defined the necessary operations to enable IPv6
   over selected Low-Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN) radio
   technologies. [rfc8376] presents an overview of those technologies.

   The core product of the working group is the Static Context Header
   Compression (SCHC) [rfc8724] technology.

   SCHC provides an extreme compression capability based on a state that
   must match on the compressor and decompressor side.  This state if
   formed of an ordered set of Compression/Decompression (C/D) rules.
   The first rule that matches is used to compress, and is indicated
   with the compression residue.  Based on the rule identifier (RuleID)
   the decompressor can rebuild the original bitstream based on the
   residue.

   [rfc8724] also provides a Fragmentation/Reassembly (F/R) capability
   to cope with a constrained Maximum Transmit Unit (MTU) below the IPv6
   minimum link MTU of 1280 bytes (see section 5 of [rfc8200]), which is
   typically the case on an LPWAN network.

   [rfc8724] was defined to compress IPv6 and UDP; but SCHC really is a
   generic compression and fragmentation technology.  As such, SCHC is
   agnostic to which protocol it compresses and at which layer it is
   operated.  The C/D peers may be hosted by different entities for
   different layers, and the F/R operation may also be performed between
   different parties, or different sub-layers in the same stack.

   If a protocol or a layer requires additional capabilities, it is
   always possible to document more specifically how to use SCHC in that
   context, or to specify additional behaviours.  For instance,
   [I-D.ietf-lpwan-coap-static-context-hc] extends the compression to
   CoAP [rfc7252] and OSCORE [rfc8613].

   SCHC is also designed to be profiled to adapt to the specific
   necessities of the various LPWAN technologies to which it is applied.
   Appendix D.  "SCHC Parameters" of [rfc8724] lists the information
   that an LPWAN technology-specific document must provide to profile
   SCHC for that technology.  As an example, [rfc9011] provides the
   profile for LoRaWAN networks.

   In order to deploy SCHC, it is mandatory that the C/D and F/R peers
   are provisionned with the exact same set of rules.  To be able to
   provision end-points from different vendors, a common data model is
   needed that expresses the SCHC rules in an interoperable fashion.  To
   that effect, [I-D.ietf-lpwan-schc-yang-data-model] defines a rule
   representation using the YANG [rfc7950] formalism.

   Finally, section 3 of [rfc8724] depicts a typical network
   architecture for an LPWAN network, simplified from that shown in
   [rfc8376]and reproduced in Figure 1.

               Figure 1: Typical LPWAN Network Architecture

   Typically, an LPWAN network topology is star-oriented, which means
   that all packets between the same source-destination pair follow the
   same path from/to a central point.  In that model, highly constrained
   Devices (Dev) exchange information with LPWAN Application Servers
   (Apps) through a central Network Gateway (NGW), which can be powered
   and is typically a lot less constrained than the Devices.  Because
   devices embed built-in applications, the traffic flows to be
   compressed are known in advance and the location of the C/D and F/R
   functions (e.g., at the Dev and NGW), and the associated rules, can
   be pre provisionned in the network .

   Then again, SCHC is very generic and its applicability is not limited
   to star-oriented deployments and/or to use cases where applications
   are very static and the state can provisionned in advance.
   [I-D.thubert-intarea-schc-over-ppp] describes an alternate deployment
   where the C/D and/or F/R operations are performed between peers of
   equal capabilities over a PPP [rfc2516] connection.  SCHC over PPP
   illustrates that with SCHC, the protocols that are compressed can be
   discovered dynamically and the rules can be fetched on-demand by both

   This document provides a general architecture for a SCHC deployment,
   positioning the required specifications, describing the possible
   deployment types, and indicating models whereby the rules can be
   distributed and installed to enable reliable and scalable operations.

2.  SCHC Operation

   As [I-D.ietf-lpwan-coap-static-context-hc] states, the SCHC
   compression and fragmentation mechanism can be implemented at
   different levels and/or managed by different organizations.  For
   instance, as represented figure Figure 3, IP compression and
   fragmentation may be managed by the network SCHC instance and end-to-
   end compression between the device and the application.  The former
   can itself be split in two instances since encryption hides the field
   structure.

           Figure 3: Different SCHC instances in a global system

   This document defines a generic architecture for SCHC that can be
   used at any of these levels.  The goal of the architectural document
   is to orchestrate the different protocols and data model defined by
   the LPWAN woeking group to design an operational and interoperable
   framework for allowing IP application over contrained networks.

3.  Definitions

4.  Global architecture

   As described in [rfc8724] a SCHC service is composed of a Parser,
   analyzing packets and creating a list of fields what will be used to
   match against the compression rules.  If a packet matches rules,
   compression can be applied following rules instructions.

   If SCHC compressed packet is too large to be send in a single L2
   frame, fragmentation will apply.  The process is similar, device
   rules are checked to find the most appropriate fragmentation rule,
   regarding the SCHC packet size, the link error rate, the reliability
   required by the application, ...

   On the other direction, when a packet SCHC arrives, the ruleID is
   used to find the rule.  Its nature allows to select if it is a
   compression or fragmentation rule.

   The rule database contains a set of rules specific to a single
   device.  The [rfc8724] indicates that the SCHC instance reads the
   rules to process C/D and F/R, rules are not modified during these
   actions.

   A SCHC instance, summarized in the Figure 4, implies C/D and F/R
   present in both end.  The device connected to a constrained network
   is in one end and the other end is either located in the core network
   or at the application.

   In any cases, the rules must be the same in both ends to perform C/D
   and F/R.

                    Figure 4: Summarized SCHC elements

   To enable rule synchronization between both ends, a common rule
   representation must be defined.

5.  Data management

   [I-D.ietf-lpwan-schc-yang-data-model] defines an YANG data model to
   represent the rules.  This enables the use of several protocols for
   rule management, such as NETCONF, RESTCONF and CORECONF.  NETCONF
   uses SSH, RESTCONF uses HTTPS, and CORECONF uses CoAP(s) as their
   respective transport layer protocols.  The data is represented in XML
   under NETCONF, in JSON under RESTCONF and in CBOR under CORECONF.

                    Figure 5: Summerized SCHC elements

   Rule Manager (RM) is in charge of handling data derived from the YANG
   Data Model and apply changes to the rules database Figure 5.

   The RM is a application using the Internet to exchange information,
   therefore:

   o  for the network-level SCHC, the communication does not require
      routing.  Each of the end-points having an RM and both RMs can be
      viewed on the same link, therefore wellknown Link Local addresses
      can be used to identify the device and the core RM.  L2 security
      MAY be deemed as sufficient, if it provides the necessary level of
      protection.

   o  for application-level SCHC, routing is involved and global IP
      addresses SHOULD be used.  End-to-end encryption is recommended.

   Management messages can also be carried in the negotiation protocol
   as proposed in [I-D.thubert-intarea-schc-over-ppp]

   The RM traffic may be itself compressed by SCHC, especially if
   CORECONF is used, [I-D.ietf-lpwan-coap-static-context-hc] can be
   used.
