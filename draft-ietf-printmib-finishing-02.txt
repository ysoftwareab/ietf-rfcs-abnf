Abstract

   This document defines a printer industry standard SNMP MIB for the
   management of printer finishing device subunits.  The finishing
   device subunits applicable to this MIB are an integral part of the
   Printer System.  This MIB does not apply to a Finisher Device that
   is not connected to a Printer System.

   The Finisher MIB is defined as an extension of the Printer MIB
   [PrtMIB] and it is expected that the information defined in this
   document will be incorporated into a future update of the Printer
   MIB.

1.  INTRODUCTION

   This document describes an SNMP Management Information Base (MIB) to
   provide for the management of in-line post-processing in a fashion
   that is currently provided for printers, using the Printer MIB
   [PrtMIB].  The Printer Finishing MIB includes the following features:

    - Provides the status of the finishing device.
    - Queries and controls the features and configuration of the
      finishing device.
    - Enables and disables the finishing processes.
    - Allows unsolicited status from the finishing device.


1.1  Scope

   This document provides a robust set of finishing devices, features,
   and functions, based upon today's state of the art of in-line
   finishing.  Since finishing typically accompanies higher speed
   network printers and copiers, in contrast to simple desktop devices,
   no attempt is made to limit the scope to "bare minimum".  On the
   other hand, the Printer Finishing MIB does not duplicate the

INTERNET-DRAFT         Printer Finishing MIB                May 11, 1998




   production mail preparation, custom insertion, franking, and reprints
   that are covered by the DMTF Large Mailing Operations standard [LMO].

   Information supplied by the Printer Finishing MIB may be utilized by
   printer and finisher management applications engaged in monitoring
   status and managing configuration, and also used by print and
   finishing submission applications which are engaged in:

    - print-job-level finishing processes that are applied to a
      complete print job,

    - document-level finishing processes that are applied individually
      to each document in the print job,

    - document-level finishing processes that are applied to a selected
      document in the print job.

   Note that not all combinations of finishing processes are
   permitted.  Compatible combinations of finishing processes are
   implemetation specific.  The MIB allows invalid combinations to be
   identified.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


1.2  Rational

   The Printer MIB [PrtMIB] is now successfully deployed in a large
   segment of the network printer market.  SNMP and/or HTTP enabled
   printers and software management applications are growing in numbers.

   There is an increase in the availability of network printers and
   copiers that include in-line finishing processes.  Thus a well
   defined and ordered set of finishing objects is now necessary for
   printer management.

   The printer model defined in the Printer MIB includes finishing
   processes and the MIB was designed to later incorporate finisher
   objects or to be referenced by a future Finisher MIB.



2.  TERMINOLOGY

   Where appropriate, the Printer Finishing MIB will conform to the
   terminology, syntax, and semantics from the DMTF Large Mailing
   Operations standard [LMO], the Internet Printing Protocol [IPP],
   and/or the ISO Document Printing Application [DPA].

   Finisher Input:  An input tray on the finisher and not otherwise
   associated with the printer.  An example of a finisher input is a
   tray that holds finishing "inserts".

   Finisher Output:  The output of the finisher.  Because processing is
   in-line, the finisher outputs are a direct extension of the set of
   printer outputs.

      Figure 2 - Finishing Process Axis Parallel to X Axis


  Media Orientation:  All Finishing Processes are defined relative to a
    portrait orientation of the medium, regardless of the orientation of
    the printed image or the direction of feed.  The 'X' and 'Y' axis,
    therefore, will always reference the medium as shown in figures 1
    and 2.  All edges and corners are also defined with the medium
    orientation as shown using the syntax top, bottom, left, and right.
    Thus the bottom edge of the medium is at Y = 0, the left edge is at
    X = 0, and the bottom right corner is at (X1,0) as shown in the
    figure 1 and at (X3,0) as shown in figure 2.

  Finishing:  Defined by DPA as an operation on a document following the
    completion of the image process.  Finishing processes defined within
    this document are those applied to one or more instances of
    rectagular paper sheet media.

   Finishing Process:  Defined by DPA as an operation applied by a
     machine such as trimming a document, folding the sheets in a
     document, and applying a binding to a document.




Bergman, Lewis               Informational                     [page 5]
INTERNET-DRAFT         Printer Finishing MIB                May 11, 1998





   Finishing Specification:  Defined by DPA as the specific sequence of
     operations for a serial combination of finishing processes.  The
     exact sequential order of the processes, in many cases, is
     critical to the obtaining the desired result.  For example, a
     folding operation followed by trimming could provide a very
     different result than if the trimming was followed by the folding.

   Finishing Process Parameters:  This parameter set is used to create a
     detailed definition of the finishing process.  Generic Finishing
     Process Parameters are applicable to any Finishing Specification.

   - Head Mechanism:  Defined by DPA as the physical mechanism that is
     used to perform a finishing process.  The head position may be
     fixed or variable depending upon the capabilities of the device.

   - Reference Edge:  Defined by DPA as the edge of the document
     relative to the axis to which the finishing process is applied.
     The edge of the medium defined to be the Reference Edge may be
     either the 'X' or the 'Y' axis, depending upon the finishing
     process to be performed.

   - Finishing Process Axis:  Defined by DPA as the axis to which some
     finishing processes are applied to or referenced from by the Head
     Mechanism.  Examples are the axis for a fold process or the axis
     for a punch process.

   - Head Locations:  Defined by DPA as the position of the Heads on the
     Finishing Process Axis.

   - Finishing Process Offset:  The offset from the Reference Edge to
     the Finishing Process Axis at which the finishing process takes
     place or is applied.



3.  FINISHER SUBUNITS INTEGRATED INTO THE PRINTER MODEL

   The Printer Finisher Device subunits receive media from one or more
   Printer Media Path subunits and deliver the media to one or more
   Printer Output subunits after the completion of the finishing
   processes.  The Printer Model, as described in the Printer MIB
   [PRTMIB], is modified adding the finisher subunit(s) and finisher
   supplies between the media path and output subunits as follows:

4.  FINISHING SPECIFICATIONS

   The Finisher MIB is able to provide most of the information that is
   required to generate a Finishing Specification.  This includes;

   1. Finishing operations that can be performed on media that are
      associated with a specific printer media path and output subunit.

   2. Combinations of operations that cannot be performed.

   3. The location of the operation on the medium, if applicable.

   4. The physical characteristics of the result of the operation.
      For example, the size and shape of a punched hole, or if a fold
      operation creates a letter fold or a "Z" fold.

   The Finisher MIB does not provide information regarding the order
   that operations can be performed.

4.1  Multiple finDeviceTable Entries

   Each finishing operation supported by the printer is represented by
   one or more entries in the finDeviceTable.  Each entry in this table
   defines a "logical" finishing device, since the function of several
   table entries may be performed by a single finisher mechanism.
   Multiple entries may also exist in the table as a result of the




Bergman, Lewis               Informational                     [page 7]
INTERNET-DRAFT         Printer Finishing MIB                May 11, 1998




   existence of multiple finisher mechanisms that perform the same type
   of operation.

   One example of possible multiple entries for a single finisher
   device, is a hole punch operation that creates more than one hole.
   This could be performed using a single die punch that moves to each
   required position or a multi-die punch that simultaneously creates
   all holes.  In either case, each defined hole position may be defined
   as a separate table entry.

   In both cases, if the punch positions can be individually selected,
   a table entry for each position would be necessary.

   For the multi-die punch, each head mechanism may have a different
   hole pattern or size.  If these differences are to be properly
   disclosed, a table entry for each head mechanism would be required.

4.2  Implicit Parameters

   Finishing operations that are specified by an enum define a
   standard operation and in many cases an implicit set of physical
   characteristics is to be included when specifying the enum.  If
   explicit values for these characteristics are not provided in the
   attributes table, the values defined in this section are to be
   implied.

5.  THE ATTRIBUTE MECHANISM

   Attributes provide a function similar to information objects, except
   that attributes are identified by an enum, instead of an OID.  Thus
   new attributes may be registered without requiring a change to the
   MIB.  In addition, an implementation that does not have the
   functionality represented by the attribute can omit the attribute
   entirely, rather than having to return a distinguished value.  The
   agent is free to materialize an attribute in the Attribute Table as




Bergman, Lewis               Informational                     [page 9]
INTERNET-DRAFT         Printer Finishing MIB                May 11, 1998




   soon as the agent is aware of the value of the attribute.

   The agent materializes finishing subunit attributes in a four-indexed
   finDeviceAttributeTable:

     1. hrDeviceIndex - which device in the host

     2. finDeviceIndex - which finisher subunit in the printer device

     3. finDeviceAttributeTypeIndex - which attribute

     4. finDeviceAttributeInstanceIndex - which attribute instance for
        those attributes that can have multiple values per finishing
        subunit.


5.1  Conformance of Attribute Implementation

   An agent SHALL implement any attribute if (1) the device supports the
   functionality represented by the attribute and (2) the information is
   available to the agent.  The agent MAY create the attribute row in
   the finDeviceAttributeTable when the information is available or MAY
   create the row earlier with the designated 'unknown' value
   appropriate for that attribute.  See next section.

   If the device does not implement or does not provide access to the
   information about an attribute, the agent SHOULD NOT create the
   corresponding row in the finDeviceAttributeTable.


5.2  Useful, 'Unknown', and 'Other' Values for Objects and Attributes

   Some attributes have a 'useful' Integer32 value, some have a 'useful'
   OCTET STRING value, some MAY have either or both depending on
   implementation, and some MUST have both.  See the
   finDeviceAttributeTypeTC textual convention for the specification of
   each attribute.

   SNMP requires that if an object cannot be implemented because its
   values cannot be accessed, then a compliant agent SHALL return an
   SNMP error in SNMPv1 or an exception value in SNMPv2.  However, this
   MIB has been designed so that 'all' objects can and SHALL be
   implemented by an agent, so that neither the SNMPv1 error nor the
   SNMPv2 exception value SHALL be generated by the agent.  This MIB has
   also been designed so that when an agent materializes an attribute,
   the agent SHALL materialize a row consisting of both the
   finDeviceAttributeValueAsInteger and
   finDeviceAttributeValueAsOctets objects.

   In general, values for objects and attributes have been chosen so
   that a management application will be able to determine whether a




Bergman, Lewis               Informational                     [page 10]
INTERNET-DRAFT         Printer Finishing MIB                May 11, 1998




   'useful', 'unknown', or 'other' value is available.  When a useful
   value is not available for an object that agent SHALL return a zero-
   length string for octet strings, the value 'unknown(2)' for enums, a
   '0' value for an object that represents an index in another table,
   and a value '-2' for counting integers.

   Since each attribute is represented by a row consisting of both the
   finDeviceAttributeValueAsInteger and finDeviceAttributeValueAsOctets
   MANDATORY objects, SNMP requires that the agent SHALL always create
   an attribute row with both objects specified.  However, for most
   attributes the agent SHALL return a "useful" value for one of the
   objects and SHALL return the 'other' value for the other object.  For
   integer only attributes, the agent SHALL always return a zero-length
   string value for the finDeviceAttributeValueAsOctets object.  For
   octet string only attributes, the agent SHALL always return a '-1'
   value for the finDeviceAttributeValueAsInteger object.


5.3  Data Sub-types and Attribute Naming Conventions

   Many attributes are sub-typed to give a more specific data type than
   Integer32 or OCTET STRING.  The data sub-type of each attribute is
   indicated on the first line(s) of the description.  Some attributes
   have several different data sub-type representations.  When an
   attribute has both an Integer32 data sub-type and an OCTET STRING
   data sub-type, the attribute can be represented in a single row in
   the finDeviceAttributeTable.  In this case, the data sub-type name is
   not included as the last part of the name of the attribute.  When the
   data sub-types cannot be represented by a single row in the
   finDeviceAttributeTable, each such representation is considered a
   separate attribute and is assigned a separate name and enum value.
   For these attributes, the name of the data sub-type is the last part
   of the name of the attribute.


5.4  Single-Value (Row) Versus Multi-Value (MULTI-ROW) Attributes

   Most attributes SHALL have only one row per finishing subunit.
   However, a few attributes can have multiple values per finishing
   subunit, where each value is a separate row in the
   finDeviceAttributeTable.  Unless indicated with 'MULTI-ROW:' in the
   finDeviceAttributeTypeTC description, an agent SHALL ensure that each
   attribute occurs only once in the finDeviceAttributeTable for a
   finishing subunit.  Most of the 'MULTI-ROW' attributes do not allow
   duplicate values, i.e., the agent SHALL ensure that each value occurs
   only once for a finishing subunit.  Only if the specification of the
   'MULTI-ROW' attribute also says "There is no restriction on the same
   xxx occurring in multiple rows" can the agent allow duplicate values
   to occur for a single finishing subunit.






Bergman, Lewis               Informational                     [page 11]
INTERNET-DRAFT         Printer Finishing MIB                May 11, 1998




5.5  Linked MUTI-ROW Values

   Some MULTI-ROW attributes are intended to go together.  Thus a set
   of value instances represent a single instance.  For example, the
   puncher attributes indicate the shape, maximum size, minimum size
   and shape of the various holes that the puncher can produce.  So the
   first set of values could represent one kind of hole, and the second
   set another kind of hole, etc.


5.6  Index Value Attributes

   A number of attributes are indexes in other tables.  Such attribute
   names end with the word 'Index'.  If the agent has not (yet) assigned
   an index value for a particular index attribute for a finishing
   subunit, the agent SHALL either: (1) return the value 0 or (2) not
   add this attribute to the finDeviceAttributeTable until the index
   value is assigned.  In the interests of brevity, the semantics for 0
   is specified once here and is not repeated for each index attribute
   specification and a DEFVAL of 0 is indicated.



6.  Enumerations

   Enumerations (enums) are sets of symbolic values defined for use
   with one or more objects.  Some common enumeration sets are
   assigned a symbolic data type name (textual convention).  These
   enumerations are listed at the beginning of this specification.


6.1  Registering Additional Enumerated Values

   The Printer Working Group (PWG) has defined several type of
   enumerations.  These enumerations differ in the method employed
   to control the addition of new enumerations.  Throughout this
   document, references to "enumeration (n)", where n can be 1, 2 or
   3 can be found in the various tables.  The definitions of these
   types of enumerations are:

   enumeration (1)  All the values are defined in the Printer Finisher
   MIB specification (RFC for the Printer Finisher MIB).  Additional
   enumerated values require a new RFC.  Type 1 enumerations are
   typically used where changes to the enumeration are either unlikely
   or will have a significant impact on the structure of the MIB or
   implementation of the MIB in management applications.

   Some criteria that suggest using a type 1 enumeration are:







Bergman, Lewis               Informational                     [page 12]
INTERNET-DRAFT         Printer Finishing MIB                May 11, 1998




     a) the set of values in the enumeration is thought to be known,
        e.g., faceUp and faceDown

     b) the enumeration defines a set of units of measure which must
        be understood by a management application to be able to
        correctly display the value of an object that measurement unit
        controls;

   and

     c) the enumeration is tied to the structure of the MIB or the
        model on which the MIB is based, i.e., the enumeration is tied
        to the OIDs for the related tables.

   There are no type 1 enums in the current draft.


   enumeration (2)  An initial set of values are defined in the
   Printer Finisher MIB specification.  Additional enumerated values
   are registered after review by this working group.  The initial
   versions of the MIB will contain the values registered so far.

   After the MIB is approved, additional values will be registered
   through IANA after approval by this working group.  The current
   set of approved values should always be obtained from the IANA
   registry. Type 2 enumerations are typically used where it is
   important to insure consistent usage of the enumeration values;
   that is, to insure that the same entity does not get two
   different enumerations values, or two different entities do not
   get the same enum value.


   enumeration (3)  An initial set of values are defined in the
   Printer Finisher MIB specification.  Additional enumerated values
   are registered without working group review.  The initial versions
   of the MIB will contain the values registered so far.  After the MIB
   is approved, additional values will be registered through IANA
   without approval by this working group.  The current set of
   approved values should always be obtained from the IANA registry.

   Type 3 enumerations are used for enumerations that can be extended
   without any controls; an example is the prtMarkerSuppliesType, which
   can be extended as needed by any manufacturer to describe the
   supplies required by a new printer.

    DESCRIPTION
        "This textual convention defines a set of enums for use in
         the finDeviceAttributeTable.  The data type tag definitions
         'INTEGER:' or 'OCTETS', indicate if the attribute can be
         represented using the object finDeviceAttributeAsInteger or
         the object finDeviceAttributeAsOctets, respectively.  In some
         cases, a choice between the two data types is possible and for
         a few attributes both objects may be required at the same time
         to properly present the value.

         NOTE - The enum assignments are grouped logically with values
         assigned in groups of 10, so that additional values may be
         registered in the future and assigned a value that is part of
         their logical grouping.

         Values in the range 2**30 to 2**31-1 are reserved for private
         or experimental usage.  This range corresponds to the same
         range reserved in IPP.  Implementers are warned that use of
         such values may conflict with other implementations.
         Implementers are encouraged to request registration of enum
         values following the procedures in Section 5.1.

-- Finisher Supply Media Input Group (Conditionally Mandatory)
--
-- A finisher device may have one or more associated supply media
-- inputs.  Each entry in this table defines an input for a
-- supply media type such as inserts, covers, etc.
--
-- This group is mandatory only if the printer system contains a
-- finisher device that requires a media supply used exclusively by a   
-- finishing process.  Examples are inserts or covers that are not
-- supplied by an input subunit that provides media to the marker.

9.  SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

   The Finisher MIB specifies a database and not necessarily a protocol
   for accessing the database. With regards to the security of the
   information within the database, it is anticipated that the primary
   vehicle for accessing this data will be through the use of the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP Version 1 has known security
   vulnerabilities due to the fact that only a "clear text" community
   name is used for accessing MIB objects within a particular entity.
   SNMPv2 attempted to provide additional security features but is still
   not considered to be an adequate solution.  SNMP Version 3 provides
   much more robust security mechanisms with regards to with support
   authentication, as well as privacy.
