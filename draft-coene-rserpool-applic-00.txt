Abstract

    This document describes the applicability of the Aggregate Server
    Access Protocol(ASAP) and Endpoint Name Resolution Protocol(ENRP)
    developed for reliable server pooling. Also some guidance is given
    on the choice of underlying transport protocol(and corresponding
    transport protocol mapping) for transporting application data and
    ASAP/ENRP specific control data.

1 INTRODUCTION

    Reliable server pooling provides protocols for providing higly
    available services. The services are located in pool of redundant
    servers and if a server fails, another server will take over. The
    only requirement put on these servers belonging to the pool is that if
    state is maintained by the server, this state must be transfered
    to the other server taking over. The mechanism for transfering this
    state information is NOT part of the Reliable server pooling
    architecture and/or protocols and must be provided by other protocols.

    The goal is to provide server based redundancy. Transport and
    network level redundancy are handle by the transport and network layer
    protcols.

    The application may choose to distribute its traffic over the servers
    of the pool conforming to a certain policy.
   
    The application wishing to make use of Rserpool protocols may use
    different transport layers(such as UDP, TCP and SCTP). However some

    transport layers may have restrictions build in in the way they
    might be operating in the Rserpool architecture and its protocols.


1.1 Scope


    The scope of this document is to explain the way that Reliable
    server pool protocols have to be used in order to provide a higly
    available service towards the application in the network.



1.2 Terminology


    The terms are commonly identified in related work and can be found
    in the Aggregate Server Access Protocol and Endpoint Name Resolution
    Protocol Common Parameters document[RFCCOMM].



1.3 Contributors


    The following people contributed to the document: L. Coene(Editor),

2 Rserpool architecture

2.1 Overview 

    A overview of the reliable server pool architecture is given in the
    Rserpool architecture document[RFCARCH].

2.2 ASAP/ENRP applicability

2.3 Application and Control data Transport 

2.4 Rserpool use between 2 pools


3 Issues for Reliable Server pooling 

3.1 State transfer accoss the server pool

    Rserpool protocols(ENRP and ASAP) do NOT provide any service for
    transfering state information of a application from one Processing
    Element(PE) to another.


4 Security considerations


Coene                                                           [Page 3]

Draft             Rserpool Applicability statement             June 2002


    The protocols used in the Reliable server pool architecture only
    tries to increase the availability of the servers in the
    network. Rserpool protocols does not contain any protocol mechanisms
    which are directly related to user message authentication, integrity
    and confidentiality functions. For such features, it depends on the
    IPSEC protocols or on Trasnport Layer Security(TLS) protocols for
    its own security and on the architecture and/or security features
    of its user protocols.

    Rserpool architecture allows the use of different Transport
    protocols for its application and control data exchange. Those
    transport protocols may have mechanisms for reducing the risk of
    blind denial-of-service attacks and/or masquerade attacks. If such
    measures are required by the applications, then it is advised to
    check the SCTP applicability statement[RFC3057] for guidance on this
    issue.
