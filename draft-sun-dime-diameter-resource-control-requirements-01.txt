Internet-Draft      Towards the Specification of a           March 2007 
                   Diameter Resource Control Application 

Abstract 

   This I-D is to analyze the gaps in the ongoing work of the QoS 
   application in the DIME WG, discuss the extension of the scope of QoS 
   application to a generic resource control application for a variety 
   of network technologies and use cases, and investigate potential 
   mechanisms to support additional resource control scenarios.  The 
   current Diameter Quality of Service Application (draft-tschofenig-
   dime-diameter-qos-01.txt) is limited to an environment where network 
   elements triggered by certain mechanisms (e.g. path-coupled QoS 
   signaling such as RSVP or NSIS initiated by end-hosts) can request 
   QoS authorization of network resources. It does not address 
   environments where end-hosts and/or network elements is unable to 
   issue a resource request initiatively. In such environments, a 
   different mode of operations is needed to allow an authorizing entity 
   to not just authorize QoS resources upon the receipt of the request 
   from network elements but also directly authorize resources and 
   dictate routers/switches to enforce the decisions without the request 
   from network elements. The new mode of operations also lends itself 
   to address resource control in general. It can control resources for 
   the purpose beyond QoS support, such as NAPT, media latching, and 
   packet filtering.

Internet-Draft      Towards the Specification of a           March 2007 
                   Diameter Resource Control Application 

   Introduction 
   This I-D is to address the gaps in the ongoing discussion of the QoS 
   application in the DIME WG, discuss the extension of the scope of QoS 
   application to a generic resource control application for a variety 
   of network technologies and use cases, and investigate potential 
   mechanisms to support additional resource control scenarios.   

   The current Diameter Quality of Service Application [draft-
   tschofenig-dime-diameter-qos-01.txt] and its predecessors is limited 
   to an environment where network elements triggered by certain 
   mechanisms (e.g. path-coupled QoS signaling such as RSVP or NSIS 
   initiated by end-hosts) can request QoS authorization of network 
   resources. It does not address environments where end-hosts and/or 
   network elements is unable to issue a resource request initiatively. 
   In such environments, a different mode of operations is needed to 
   allow an authorizing entity (the policy decision point in the [draft-
   tschofenig-dime-diameter-qos-01.txt] nomenclature)  to not just 
   authorize QoS resources upon the receipt of the request from network 
   elements but also directly authorize resources and dictate 
   routers/switches to enforce the decisions without the request from 
   network elements. Current frameworks and mechanisms defined in 
   [draft-tschofenig-dime-diameter-qos-01.txt] are not sufficient to 
   support those scenarios and further extension and enhancement is 
   needed to support a universal resource control framework. The new 
   mode of operations also lends itself to address resource control in 
   general. It can control resources for the purpose beyond QoS support, 
   such as NAPT, media latching, and packet filtering such as described 
   in [ITU-T RACF] and [TISPAN RACS].  

   This I-D analyzes the relationship between QoS mechanisms/end user 
   equipment's capabilities and resource control modes, and discusses 
   functional requirements and functional framework to ensure the 
   completeness of the protocol development for purpose of general 
   resource control. Finally, this document describes some enhancements 
   of Diameter protocol for Push mode of resource control, which can 
   also be extended to support Pull mode of resource control and leads 
   to a universal functional framework for different types of end user 
   equipments and quality of service mechanisms offered in the same 
   network.

Internet-Draft      Towards the Specification of a           March 2007 
                   Diameter Resource Control Application 

   The following terms are used in this document: 

   Application Functions 

   The application functions (AF) is a functional entity responsible for 
   controlling the application layer session and interacting with the 
   end user equipment at the application level. It may extract/derive 
   the end user resource request from the received application signaling 
   message. The AF can be an application server or SIP proxy.  

   Diameter Resource Control Application 

   It is the AAA application protocol that is defined in this      
   document and is used for the purpose of resource control. 

   End User Equipment 

   The end user equipment (UE) is a functional entity responsible for 
   establishing a user application session with the network. Its 
   resource control and signaling capabilities may vary. 

   Pull Mode 

   In this mode, the network layer signaling received from the end user 
   equipment triggers the resource control session. The Resource Control 
   Enforcement Entity then pulls the resource control decisions from the 
   server. The Diameter resource control application shall support this 
   mode. 

   Push Mode  

   In this mode, application functions or changes in local network 
   conditions received trigger the resource control session. The 
   Resource Control Decision Entity then pushes the resource control 
   decisions to the client. The Diameter resource control application 
   shall support this mode. 

   Resource Control Enforcement Entity  

   The Resource Control Enforcement Entity (RCE) is a functional entity 
   responsible for enforcing resource control decisions on gate 
   operation (open/close the gate) and other QoS resources and network 
   resources, i.e. policy enforcement point (PEP) as defined in 
   [RFC2753]. A Diameter client collocates with the RCE in the same 
   network element for a Diameter resource control session. 

   Resource Control Decision Entity

Internet-Draft      Towards the Specification of a           March 2007 
                   Diameter Resource Control Application 

   The Resource Control Decision Entity (RCD) is a functional entity 
   responsible for making decisions on resource authorization, 
   reservation and commitment according to a set of information such as 
   service information, network policy, end user subscription and 
   network resource availability, i.e. policy decision point (PDP) as 
   defined in [RFC2753]. A Diameter server collocates with the RCD in 
   the same network element for a Diameter resource control session. 

   Resource Control Session 

   This is a Diameter session that supports the Diameter resource 
   control application. 

   Resource Control Decision 

   A set of information including the resource control actions and the 
   relevant IP media flows to that these actions need to be applied. 

2. Functional models and requirements  

   This section discusses the implications of underlying network QoS 
   mechanisms and various end user capabilities on policy based resource 
   control approach, and summarizes functional models and requirements.  

2.1. Implications of end user capabilities and QoS mechanisms 

2.1.1. End user equipment capabilities  

   The end user equipment's (UE) capabilities are varied in relation to 
   resource control, which can be categorized as follows: 

   o  Category 1: No resource control capability in both application and 
      network layers. This type of end user equipment may set up a 
      connection through application layer signaling, but it is unable 
      to provide specific resource/QoS requirements either through 
      application layer signaling e.g. SIP or through network layer 
      signaling e.g. RSVP or NSIS (or does not support network layer 
      signaling at all).  

   o  Category 2: Only has resource control capability in the 
      application layer. This type of end user equipment is able to set 
      up a connection through application layer signaling with certain 
      resource requirements (e.g. application level service attributes), 
      but it is unable to provide specific network level resource 
      requirements (e.g., network QoS class) through network layer 
      signaling e.g., RSVP or NSIS (or does not support network layer 
      signaling at all).

Internet-Draft      Towards the Specification of a           March 2007 
                   Diameter Resource Control Application 

   o  Category 3: Has resource control capability in the network layer. 
      This type of end user equipment may set up a connection through an 
      application layer signaling and translate service characteristics 
      into network level resource requirements (e.g. network QoS class) 
      locally, and request the resources through network layer signaling 
      e.g. RSVP or NSIS. 

2.1.2. QoS mechanisms  

   A couple of different QoS mechanisms are employed commonly in packet 
   networks. Those QoS mechanisms can be categorized into two models: 
   intserv [RFC1633] and diffserv [RFC2475]. In the intserv model, 
   network layer signaling e.g RSVP [2210], NSIS [I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-
   nslp], or link specific signaling is commonly used to initiate a 
   request from end user equipment for desired QoS resource of a media 
   flow. In the diffserv model, the QoS resources are provisioned based 
   on some predefined QoS service classes rather than QoS requests on a 
   per flow basis.       

   It is obvious that the QoS mechanisms have some correlation with the 
   UEs capability in terms of resource control process. Since category 1 
   and 2 UEs cannot initiate the resource requests through the network 
   layer signaling, the intserv model is not applicable to them in 
   general. Category 3 UEs may decide whether or not to use the network 
   layer signaling for requesting the resource or not based on network 
   requirements and operator's configuration. 

   The diversity of QoS capabilities of UEs and networks results in 
   differences in how the resource control system interacts with 
   underlying network elements. In the intserv model, the resource 
   control session is typically initiated by network element when a 
   trigger such as the network layer signaling is received from the end 
   user equipment, and resource authorization decisions are produced 
   upon the request of the network element (i.e. Resource Control 
   Enforcement Entity). In the diffserv model, since the network element 
   is unable to initiatively request the resource authorization, the 
   resource control session is typically triggered by either application 
   functions or resource control conditions defined by the operator, and 
   then the authorization decisions are pushed by the decision function 
   (i.e. Resource Control Decision Entity) to the network element 
   without explicit request.   

2.2. Resource control models  

   According to the above analysis, two resource control models are 
   needed in support of different combinations of QoS mechanisms and 
   UE's capabilities.

Internet-Draft      Towards the Specification of a           March 2007 
                   Diameter Resource Control Application 

   o  Push model: The resource control session is triggered by 
      application functions or local network conditions (e.g. time of 
      day on resource usage and QoS classes), and resource control 
      decisions are pushed by the decision function. 

      Moreover, the push model can be further divided into two types: 

      - UE initiated push model 

      - Network initiated push model  

      In the former, the resource control session is triggered by 
      application functions due to the explicit request of UE through 
      application layer signaling, e.g. SIP; in the latter, the resource 
      control session is triggered by application functions without 
      explicit request of UE.  

   o  Pull model: The resource control session is triggered by the 
      network layer signaling received from end user equipments or by 
      the local event in the network element according to pre-configured 
      policies, and resource control decisions are pulled by the network 
      element. 

      There are 3 types of modes described in [I-D.tschofenig-nsis-qos-
      authz-issues], and [draft-tschofenig-dime-diameter-qos-01.txt]. 
      All of them can be regarded as use cases of Pull model. 

      The similar resource control models are also addressed in [ITU-T 
      RACF].  

      The Pull model is applicable to GPRS networks as defined in [3GPP 
      PCC] or Intserv enabled IP networks; the Pull model is applicable 
      to some other networks, for example, Cable network, DSL, Ethernet, 
      Diffserv enabled IP/MPLS as defined in [CableLabs PCMM], [DSL 
      Forum Policy Control Framework], [ITU-T RACF] and [TISPAN RACS].  

   The different resource control models are required in support of 
   distinctive capabilities of end user equipments. For category 1 and 2 
   of UEs, the Push model is mandated, in which the resource control 
   operations are triggered by the application functions, and the 
   resource control decisions are pushed from the Resource Control 
   Decision Entity down to the Resource Control Enforcement Entity. For 
   category 3 of UE, either push model or pull mode is doable, the 
   operation of Push model is the same as that of category 1/2; in the 
   Pull model, the resource control operations are triggered by the 
   network layer signaling received from UEs, and the resource control

Internet-Draft      Towards the Specification of a           March 2007 
                   Diameter Resource Control Application 

   decisions are pulled from the Resource Control Decision Entity by the 
   Resource Control Enforcement Entity.  

   However, it is expected that the resource control trends towards the 
   Push model for all types of UE and network technologies, since the 
   Pull model requires extra QoS mechanism and interaction in the 
   network elements that may lead to complexity, scalability and cost-
   effectiveness issues.  

2.3. Functional requirements  

   It is worth pointing out that in pull model, the decision function is 
   still allowed to push down updated decisions, as needed, of an 
   existing resource control session. Similarly, in push model, the 
   network element is also allowed to request (pull) the re-
   authorization of an existing resource control session.  

   Therefore, the functional requirements and framework have to take 
   into both models as a whole when developing the protocol, mechanism 
   and relevant parameters. The main functional requirements of Diameter 
   resource control application are hence as follows: 

   o  Shall interwork with various QoS mechanisms and UEs for different 
      network technologies, i.e., both pull and push models can be 
      supported within the same functional framework. 

   o  Shall provide broad resource control functions spanning from 
      network QoS resource control to network accessibility and security 
      resource control and NAT traversal/NAPT resource control etc. 

   o  Shall perform the admission control on a per flow per subscriber 
      basis according to multiple facets of network conditions, e.g. 
      local network policies, resource availability and subscription. 

   o  Shall instruct the enforcement of resource control decisions on 
      per flow basis. 

2.4. Functional framework  

   A generic functional framework of Diameter resource control 
   application is illustrated in figure 1. The Resource Control Decision 
   Entity (RCD) (i.e. the decision function, serving the functionality 
   of policy decision point as defined in [RFC2753][RFC3084]) is 
   responsible for authorizing the resource request and formulating 
   resource control decisions based on service information, network 
   local policies, end user subscription and network resource 
   availability etc. The Resource Control Enforcement Entity (RCE) (i.e.

Internet-Draft      Towards the Specification of a           March 2007 
                   Diameter Resource Control Application 

   network element, serving the functionality of policy enforcement 
   point as defined in [RFC2753][RFC3084]) is responsible for enforcing 
   the resource control decisions (e.g. opening/closing the gates of IP 
   flows, limiting the traffic bandwidth, marking/remarking QoS class of 
   IP packets, metering network resource usage); in addition, it may 
   support other functions, e.g. media relay and address latching 
   functions for NAT traversal and NAPT. The application functions 
   (AF)(e.g. application server, SIP proxy or video headend of IPTV) are 
   responsible for initiating the resource request and populating the 
   service information into a resource request message. In this 
   functional framework the Resource Control Decision Entity (RCD) acts 
   as a Diameter server and the Resource Control Enforcement Entity 
   (RCE) acts as a Diameter client. 

   The Resource Control Decision Entity and application functions can be 
   collocated in the same physical box within the same provider domain 
   or distributed throughout the network between different provider 
   domains. The interaction of the Resource Control Decision Entity and 
   application functions is outside the scope of this document. 

   The Resource Control Decision Entity and Resource Control Enforcement 
   Entity typically shall be located in the same provider's network 
   domain. There can be multiple Resource Control Decision Entities in 
   the system for supporting different instances of application 
   functions. For each service request, only one RCD should make the 
   final resource control decision. However, the detailed architecture 
   of the resource control system and its interfaces are implementation 
   specific and are out of scope of this specification.

   (1) The End User Equipment requests an application-specific service 
   by sending a service request (e.g. SIP Invite, HTTP Get,) to 
   Application Functions. The service request may or may not contain any 
   explicit parameters for service quality requirement.             

   (2) The application functions derive resource requirements and 
   populate service information (e.g. bandwidth, media type and 
   application description etc.), and send a request to the RCD. 

   (3) Upon receipt of the request from the AF, the RCD performs the 
   initial authorization, establishes a new resource control session 
   (i.e. a Diameter session), makes and pushes down initial resource 
   control decisions to corresponding RCE node according to the 
   indication received from the AF or local policies. The RCE enforces 
   the decisions accordingly to reserve and/or commit network resources.

   (1) The End User Equipment requests an application-specific service 
   by sending a service request .e.g. SIP Invite, HTTP Get,.to the 
   Application Functions. The service request may or may not contain any 
   explicit (application) service quality requirements. 

   (2) The application functions derive resource requirements and 
   populate service information (e.g. bandwidth, media type and 
   application description etc.), and send a request to the RCD. 

   (3) The Resource Control Decision Entity checks authorization based 
   on network policy rules etc. If the resources are authorized, an 
   authorization token (RFC 3520) may be assigned to this service and 
   informed to the End User Equipment. (The use of authorization token

                   Diameter Resource Control Application 

   is optional. It is possible to perform authorization without the use 
   of a token.) 

   (4) The End User Equipment initiates an explicit QoS request for 
   resource reservation to the Resource Control Enforcement Entity. This 
   QoS request contains the explicit transport QoS requirement 
   parameters for an application-specific service. It may also contain 
   an authorization token assigned at the first phase. 

   (5) On receipt of the QoS request, the Resource Control Enforcement 
   Entity sends a request to Resource Control Decision Entity for 
   resource reservation and admission control that may contain the 
   authorization token as an option.  

   (6) The Resource Control Decision Entity makes the final decision of 
   reservation and admission control. If the request is granted, the 
   Resource Control Decision Entity provides the decisions to the 
   Resource Control Enforcement Entity. The Resource Control Enforcement 
   Entity enforces the decisions accordingly. 

3. New Commands and AVPs of Diameter resource control application for 
   Push model 

   This section defines a pair of new command codes and several new 
   mandatory AVPs and describes the usage of these command codes and 
   AVPs for Diameter resource control application in order to support 
   the push model.  

3.1. Command codes 

   Section 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 define new Diameter message Command-Code 
   values that MUST be supported by all Diameter implementations that 
   conform to this specification.  The command codes are as follows: 

    

      Command-Name                  Abbrev.    Code     Reference

                   Diameter Resource Control Application 

3.1.1. Policy-Install-Request command 

   The Policy-Install-Request (PIR) message, indicated by the Command-
   Code field set to TBD and the 'R' bit set in the Command Flags field, 
   is sent by the RCD to the RCE for originating a resource control 
   session from the RCD (Diameter server) side with the PI-Request-Type 
   set to INITIAL_REQUEST, and contains resource control decision 
   information that is relevant to the initiation. In addition, it may 
   also update or terminate an existing session from the RCD side with 
   the PI-Request-Type set to UPDATE_REQUEST or TERMINATION_RQUEST.  

   The Auth-Application-Id MUST be set to the value xxx, indicating the   
   Diameter resource control application. 

     Message Format: 
      <PI-Request> ::= < Diameter Header: xxx, REQ, PXY > 
               < Session-Id > 
               { Auth-Application-Id } 
               { Origin-Host } 
               { Origin-Realm } 
               { Destination-Realm } 
               { Destination-Host } 
               { PI-Request-Type }  
               { PI-Request-Number }  
               [ Origin-State-Id ]

               *[ Route-Record ] 
               *[ AVP ] (note) 
    

   Note: The relevant AVPs to QoS, resource control decisions are FFS. 
   Some high level information is described in section 4.1.2.2.  

3.1.2. Policy-Install-Answer command 

   The PIA command, indicated by the Command-Code field set to TBD and 
   the 'R' bit cleared in the Command Flags field, is sent by the RCE to 
   the RCD in response to the PIR command. 

     Message Format:

3.2. New AVPs 

3.2.1. PI-Request-Type AVP 

   The PI-Request-Type AVP (AVP Code xxx) is of type Enumerated and 
   contains the reason for sending the policy-install request command. 
   It MUST be present in all Policy-Install-Request messages.  The 
   following values are defined for the PI-Request-Type AVP: 

      INITIAL_REQUEST                    1 

         An Initial request is used to initiate a resource control 
   session from the Diameter Server side, and contains resource control 
   information that is relevant to the initiation. 

      UPDATE_REQUEST                   2 

         An Update request contains resource-control information for an 
   existing resource control session.  Update Policy-Install requests 
   SHOULD be sent every time at the expiry of the allocated quota or 
   validity time. Further, additional service-specific events MAY 
   trigger a spontaneous Update request. 

      TERMINATION_REQUEST      3 

         A Termination request is sent to terminate a resource control 
   session and contains resource control information relevant to the 
   existing session.   

3.2.2. PI-Request-Number AVP 

   The PI-Request-Number AVP (AVP Code xxx) is of type Unsigned32 and 
   identifies this request within one session.  As Session-Id AVPs are 
   globally unique, the combination of Session-Id and PI-Request-Number 
   AVPs is also globally unique and can be used in matching policy 
   install messages with confirmations.  An easy way to produce unique

                   Diameter Resource Control Application 

   numbers is to set the value to 0 for a policy-install request of type 
   INITIAL_REQUEST and EVENT_REQUEST and to set the value to 1 for the 
   first UPDATE_REQUEST, to 2 for the second, and so on until the value 
   for TERMINATION_REQUEST is one more than for the last UPDATE_REQUEST. 

3.2.3. Other resource control AVPs 

   It is FFS the format and definition of resource control related AVPs 
   such as QoS AVPs, flow descriptor etc. One option is to adopt the 
   data structure defined by [I-D.tschofenig-dime-diameter-qos] and its 
   successor; another option is to adopt the data structure defined by 
   3GPP Gx [29.212]. No matter what data structure is used, the 
   following information shall be defined accordingly. 

   o  IP media flow description (e.g. IP 5-tuple (port number can be a 
      range) and direction) 

   o  QoS information (e.g. authorized bandwidth, network service Class) 

   o  Resource control actions (e.g., gate opening/closing) 

   o  Other resource control information, e.g., 

       o NAT traversal/NAPT information (e.g. address latching, address 
          translation information) 

       o Usage metering and statistics reporting 

   Additional AVPs may be defined to further facilitate the resource 
   control functions and procedure, e.g., 

   o  Network layer session Identifier (e.g. signaling session ID) 

   o  Reservation priority 

   o  Traffic descriptor (e.g. peak/committed date rate, peak/committed 
      bucket size and excess bucket size) 

4. Procedures 

   This section elaborates on the example call flows of resource control 
   application based on  aforementioned new command codes, and existing 
   command codes from the Diameter Base protocol [RFC3588] and the 
   credit-control application [RFC4006] as follows (other valid command 
   codes are FFS, such as AAR/AAA [RFC4005], DER/DEA [RFC4072], 
   ACR/ACA):

      Abort-Session-Answer          ASA        274      RFC 3588 

   The procedures for Push model and Pull model are quite similar. The 
   main difference is for the session initiation, i.e., the RCD will 
   initiate a new session in the Push model; instead, the RCE will 
   initiate a new session in the Pull model. The session modification 
   and termination procedures are identical for Push and Pull models. 

4.1. Session initiation  

4.1.1. Session initiation for Push Model 

   When the RCD receives a resource control request from the AF, it 
   shall translate the service information (e.g. media type, media flow 
   descriptions, application layer QoS (service class and bandwidth) 
   into network layer information, evaluate network policies (e.g. time 
   of day), examine UE's subscription (e.g. maximum allowed bandwidth), 
   and check network resource availability. The resource availability 
   check may be supported by an element, such as the Transport Resource 
   Control Functional Entity (TRC-FE) [ITU-T RACF], which interacts with 
   the RCD to ensure the availability of requested transport network 
   resources. The detailed procedures for controlling other network 
   resources e.g. NAT traversal are FFS.  

   An initial authorization can be admitted by the RCD if for all IP 
   media flows in the session, all conditions are satisfied.  The RCD 
   may determine the necessary QoS resources (e.g. maximum allowed 
   bandwidth) and resource control operations as one of following 
   options:

   o  Reserve network resources only (gate status is closed or disabled) 

   o  Reserve and commit network resource (gate status is open or 
      enabled)  

   In the Push model, the RCD shall support a selection mechanism to 
   identify the corresponding RCE and the binding mechanism to correlate 
   the resource request from the AF with relevant subscriber profile and 
   IP media flows; and then the RCD shall send a Policy-Install-Request 
   message with the PI-Request-Type set to "INITIAL_REQUEST" to the RCE 
   with all decision data.  

   The RCD may include the authorization lifetime that allows the RCE to 
   determine how long the authorization decision is valid for this 
   particular QoS reservation. 

   In addition, if the RCD needs to maintain resource control session 
   state in stateful operation (the stateless operation is FFS and 
   subject to the discussion of DIME group), it should save certain 
   information for management of the session (e.g. resource control 
   session ID, resource control decision data etc.). 

   When the RCE receive the PIR message with new Diameter session ID, it 
   shall treat it as a new request and initiate a new Diameter session 
   accordingly if the stateful operation is used.  

   The RCE shall enforce the resource control decisions of PIR message 
   received from the RCD. For example, if the resource control decisions 
   indicate the gate should be open, the RCE shall allocate the 
   requested bandwidth and open the gate according to IP flow 
   description (e.g. IP 5-tuple).  

   The final result of the resource control enforcement is provided in 
   the Result-Code AVP of the Policy-Install-Answer message sent by the 
   RCE, in case of successful authorization, the Result-Code is set to 
   DIAMETER_LIMITED_SUCCESS, (see [RFC3588])).

                Figure 4 Session initiation for Push Model 

   1. A resource control session is initiated by the RCD when a trigger 
      is received. The trigger can be a resource request from the AF or 
      a local event due to network policies/conditions. 

   2. The RCD stores the service information received from the AF and 
      authorizes the request based on service information, network 
      resource availability, end user's transport subscription and 
      provisioned network policies, and determines the resource 
      reservation operation mode (e.g. reservation only, or reservation 
      + commitment).  

   3. The RCD discovers pertinent RCCs and pushes down policy decisions 
      to those RCCs using PIR command with the PI-Request-Type set to 
      "INITIAL-REQUEST".

   4. The RCE installs policy decisions, and performs policy 
      enforcement operations as needed, e.g., enforcing the authorized 
      QoS and enabling or disabling IP media flows according to the 
      corresponding policy decision (e.g. the flow status). 

   5. The RCE sends PIA to RCD to acknowledge the receipt of PIR. 

4.1.2. Session initiation for Pull Model 

   When the RCE receives the path-coupled QoS signaling from UE or the 
   trigger of a local event, it initiates a new resource control session 
   and sends a resource request message to the RCD. 

   Upon receipt of the request from the RCE, the RCD will perform the 
   resource control operation, which is same as described in section 
   4.1.1. 

   Since the session is initiated from the RCE side, the RCD does not 
   need to perform the selection of RCE instance. But the RCE should 
   maintain the linkage with corresponding RCD.

                Figure 5 Session initiation for Pull Model 

   1. Upon receipt of path-coupled QoS signaling or the trigger of 
      local event, the RCE initiates a new resource control session and 
      sends a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value 
      "INITIAL_REQUEST" (other options e.g. AAR are FFS). 

   2. This step is the same as step 2 of Push model. 

   3. The RCD sends the policy decisions to the RCE using CCA command, 
      including authorized QoS, event triggers etc. 

   4. This step is the same as step 4 of Push model. 

   5. The RCE sends path-coupled QoS signaling to the UE to acknowledge 
      the reservation and may send back a confirmation to RCD.

4.2. Session modification 

   The session modification procedure for Push and Pull models is 
   identical, i.e., the same command codes, AVPs and procedures can be 
   used for both of them.  

   The session modification can be triggered by the update request 
   received from the AF or local network condition (e.g. time of day), 
   or by the request from the RCE upon the change of network status 
   according to the specific event indication received from the RCD in 
   the session initiation (e.g. retrieve and re-authorize the resource 
   control decisions). 

   When one of triggers occurs, the RCD shall determine the operation of 
   the session modification as one of follows: 1) Modification of 
   requested resources; 2) Commitment of requested resources; 3) Removal 
   of requested resources. 

   The RCD produces a set of updated resource control decisions and 
   sends to the RCE through the RAR command (another option is to use 
   PIR with the PI-Request-Type set to UPDATE-REQUEST). 

   Upon receipt of RAR with an existing session ID (or a PIR message 
   with the PI-Request-Type set to UPDATE-REQUEST), the RCE shall treat 
   it as a modification request. The RCE shall determine the operations 
   to enforce the updated decisions as one of follows: 

   o  Install decision for a new IP media flow without committing the 
      requested resources if the flow/gate status is set to 
      closed/DISABLED.  

   o  Install decision and commit the requested resources for a new IP 
      media flow if the flow/gate status is set to open/ENABLED (e.g. 
      open the gates).  

   o  Modify decision for an existing IP media flow without committing 
      the requested resources if the flow/gate status is set to 
      closed/DISABLED (e.g. increase or decrease the allocated 
      bandwidth, but the RTCP gate may remain the opening status). 

   o  Modify decision and commit the requested resources for an existing 
      IP media flow if the flow/gate status is set to open/ENABLED (e.g. 
      open the gates with modified bandwidth). 

   o  Commit the requested resources for an existing IP media flow if 
      the flow/gate status is set to open/ENABLED (e.g. open the gates 
      with reserved bandwidth).

   o  Revoke the installed decisions and release the committed or 
      reserved resources for all related IP media flows if the flow/gate 
      status is set to REMOVED.  

   The final result of the resource control enforcement is provided in 
   the Result-Code AVP of the Policy-Install-Answer message sent by the 
   RCE (or RAA message), in case of successful authorization, the 
   Result-Code is set to DIAMETER_LIMITED_SUCCESS, (see [RFC3588])). 

   When the RCE is triggered by the change of network status, it may 
   send a CCR message with requested specific action to the RCD. The RCD 
   shall provide the updated decision data through the CCA message.

   1. The resource modification can be triggered by the request from AF 
      or local event, and by the request from RCE (using CCR command). 

   2. The RCD re-evaluates the policies and updates policy decisions if 
      needed, and determines the affected IP media flows, and 
      corresponding QoS and gate operations.  

   3. The RCD identifies the affected RCCs and forwards the updated 
      policy decisions using a Diameter RAR or CCA (the use of PIR in 
      this case is FFS). 

   4. The RCE updates policy decisions, and performs policy enforcement 
      operations as needed, e.g., enforcing the authorized QoS and 
      enabling or disabling IP media flows according to the modified 
      policy decision (e.g. the flow status). 

   5. The RCE responds RAA command to acknowledge the RAR.    

4.3. Session termination 

   The session termination procedure for Push and Pull models is 
   identical, i.e., the same command codes, AVPs and procedures can be 
   used for both of them.  

   The session termination can be triggered by the request received from 
   the AF when an application session is released or by local network 
   condition. In addition, the RCE may request the session termination 
   according to the change of network status or expiry of a session. 

   When the session termination is triggered by AF or local network 
   condition, the RCD shall send a ASR message with existing session ID 
   (or send a PIR message with PI-Request-Type set to "TERMINATION-
   REQUEST"), the RCE shall release all network resources and return a 
   PIA (or ASA). 

   When the session termination is triggered by the change of network 
   status or expiry of a session, the RCE shall send a CCR message with 
   CC-Request-Type set to "TERMINATION-REQUEST", the RCD shall release 
   all network resources and return a CCA. In addition, the RCD shall 
   release all resources and notify the AF for affected application 
   sessions.

                       Figure 7 Session termination 

   1. The session termination can be triggered by the request from AF 
      or local event, and by the request from RCE (using CCR command). 

   2. The RCD determines the affected IP media flows and releases all 
      resources.  

   3. The RCD sends ASR to terminate the session if the request is 
      triggered by AF or local event. or uses CCA to indicate the 
      release if the request is from the RCE (the use of PIR in this 
      case is FFS). 

   4. The RCE releases all local resources. 

   5. The RCE responds ASA command to acknowledge the ASR as needed.

4.4. Specific event actions 

   The RCD may indicate to be notified of certain events (e.g. bearer 
   failure) by specifying them in the indication of specific event 
   action through PIR or RAR message. 

   If an event subscribed by the RCD through PIR or RAR occurs, the RCE 
   shall send a CCR command to the RCD containing: 

   o  The value of the indication of specific event action, indicating 
      the event that occurred; and 

   o  Optionally, the appropriate Cause value. 

5. Selection and binding mechanisms 

   The detailed selection and binding mechanisms is FFS. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines two new Diameter commands, several new AVPs and 
   a new Diameter application. 

6.1. Command Codes 

   This document defines the following new command codes: 

      Command-Name                  Abbrev.    Code     Reference
