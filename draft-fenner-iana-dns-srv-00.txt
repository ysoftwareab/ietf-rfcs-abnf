Abstract

   This document proposes a registry for service names used in DNS SRV
   records.

1.  Introduction

   The traditional interpretation of the service name used in SRV
   records [RFC2782] is that the name from the port number registry
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers>[[anchor2: is this the

   best way to refer to this? urn:iana:port-numbers?  "The IANA Port
   Number registry"? --wcf]] is used as the name of the service.
   However, one of the possible uses for SRV records is to avoid the
   need for a unique port number, by having the port number specified in
   the DNS record.  The use of the port-numbers repository requires
   assignment of a port number along with the name.

   One community resource that has sprung up to address this problem is
   <http://www.dns-sd.org/ServiceTypes.html>.  There may, of course, be
   others, and of course registration in this registry doesn't prevent
   the same name being used for a port number, or being registered in a
   different community registry, etc.

   This document proposes the use of a registry that consists only of
   service names, with no associated port numbers, and describes
   procedures for maintaining this registry.

2.  Registry for Service Names

   The service name registry
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names> was originally
   established for the names of services as used in WKS records.  Since
   [RFC2782] only refers to "as defined in Assigned Numbers", which
   contains both of these registries, it's not clear which registry is
   meant.  Since this registry contains only service names and
   descriptions, it's a better match to the requirements of SRV records.
   This document proposes moving to this registry, with a plan for
   transition and rules for maintenance of the new registry.

3.  Transition

   All service names in the port-numbers registry will be copied to the
   service-names registry, along with their descriptions and any
   available references.  Ad-hoc registries such as
   <http://www.dns-sd.org/ServiceTypes.html> should be copied too;
   readers are requested to notify the author if they know of any other
   ad-hoc registries; IANA will be asked to copy from the list of ad-hoc
   registries that exist in this document at the time of publication.

4.  Future Registrations

   In order to point to the correct registry, RFC 2782 is modified to
   read:
   Service   The symbolic name of the desired service, as defined in
             <http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names>[[anchor5:
             urn:iana:service-names ?  "The IANA Service Names
             registry"? --wcf]] or locally.  An underscore (_) is
             prepended to the service identifier to avoid collisions

             with DNS labels that occur in nature.

   Any future registries in the port-numbers registry will be mirrored
   in the service-names registry.  The protocol name space is shared
   between the port-numbers and service-names registry; new
   registrations in the port-numbers registry must not be allowed to
   overlap with a name in the service-names registry (unless they are
   the same protocol).

5.  IANA Considerations

   New registrations in the service-names registry should be assigned on
   a First Come First Served basis as defined in [RFC2434].  The
   information required is a service name, description, and reference to
   the protocol specification or any additional information.  The
   protocol specification may be referred to by RFC number or URL, and
   is optional.

   As in the port number registry, the service name is limited to 14
   characters, composed of letters, digits and hyphens.  The service
   name is not case-sensitive and is normally registered in all
   lowercase.[[anchor6: Are these the right restrictions on the
   character set and/or length of service names? --wcf]][[anchor7: 14
   chars, letters-digits-hyphens just like port names --marc]][[anchor8:
   63 octets dns label limit --olaf]]

   New registrations in the port-numbers registry will automatically be
   added to the service-names registry as well.  A registration in the
   service-names registry that requires a port number in the future may
   be registered using the normal port-numbers procedure.

   As described in Section 3, IANA is asked to copy into the service-
   names registry existing registrations from the port number registry
   and the following ad-hoc community registries:
   o  <http://www.dns-sd.org/ServiceTypes.html>
   o  (...any others that are identified before RFC publication)

6.  Security Considerations

   Having a single registry for SRV service names eliminates the
   confusion caused by duplicate service names, where a client could
   look up one service and get a different service that uses the same
   name.
