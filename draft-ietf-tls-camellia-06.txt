Abstract

    This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to support the Camellia
    encryption algorithm as a bulk cipher algorithm.


1. Introduction

    This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the
    TLS protocol [TLS] to support the Camellia encryption algorithm as
    a bulk cipher algorithm.  This proposal provides a new option for
    fast and efficient bulk cipher algorithms.

    Note: This work was done when the first author worked for NTT.

Internet-Draft        Camellia Ciphersuites for TLS         October 2004


1.1. Camellia

    Camellia was selected as a recommended cryptographic primitive by
    the EU NESSIE (New European Schemes for Signatures, Integrity and
    Encryption) project [NESSIE] and included in the list of
    cryptographic techniques for Japanese e-Government systems, which
    were selected by the Japan CRYPTREC (Cryptography Research and
    Evaluation Committees) [CRYPTREC].  Camellia is also included in
    specification of the TV-Anytime Forum [TV-ANYTIME]. The TV-Anytime
    Forum is an association of organizations that seeks to develop
    specifications to enable audio-visual and other services based on
    mass-market high volume digital storage in consumer
    platforms. Camellia is specified as Ciphersuite in TLS used by
    Phase 1 S-7 (Bi-directional Metadata Delivery Protection)
    specification and S-5 (TV-Anytime Rights Management and Protection
    Information for Broadcast Applications) specification. Camellia
    has been submitted to other several standardization bodies such as
    ISO (ISO/IEC 18033) and IETF S/MIME Mail Security Working Group
    [Camellia-CMS].

    Camellia supports 128-bit block size and 128-, 192-, and 256-bit
    key sizes, i.e. the same interface specifications as the Advanced
    Encryption Standard (AES) [AES].

    Camellia was jointly developed by NTT and Mitsubishi Electric
    Corporation in 2000. It was carefully designed to withstand all
    known cryptanalytic attacks and even to have a sufficiently large
    security leeway. It has been scrutinized by worldwide
    cryptographic experts.

    Camellia was also designed to have suitability for both software
    and hardware implementations and to cover all possible encryption
    applications that range from low-cost smart cards to high-speed
    network systems.  Compared to the AES, Camellia offers at least
    comparable encryption speed in software and hardware.  In
    addition, a distinguishing feature is its small hardware design.
    Camellia perfectly meets one of the current TLS market
    requirements, where low power consumption is a mandatory
    condition.

    The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described
    in [Camellia-Desc]. The Camellia homepage,
    http://info.isl.ntt.co.jp/camellia/, contains a wealth of
    information about camellia, including detailed specification,
    security analysis, performance figures, reference implementation
    and test vectors.

1.2.  Terminology

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
    NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document (in
    uppercase, as shown) are to be interpreted as described in
    [RFC2119].

2. Proposed Cipher Suites

    The new ciphersuites proposed here have the following definitions:

    CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x41 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00,0x42 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00,0x43 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x44 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x45 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x46 };

    CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA      = { 0x00,0x84 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00,0x85 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA   = { 0x00,0x86 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x87 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x88 };
    CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA  = { 0x00,0x89 };


3. CipherSuite Definitions

3.1. Cipher

    All the ciphersuites described here use Camellia in cipher block
    chaining (CBC) mode as a bulk cipher algorithm.  Camellia is a
    128-bit block cipher with 128-, 192-, and 256-bit key sizes,
    i.e. it supports the same block and key sizes as the Advanced
    Encryption Standard (AES).  However, this document only defines
    ciphersuites for 128- and 256-bit keys as well as AES ciphersuites
    for TLS [AES-TLS]. They are enough for use in efficient and
    practical cases as well as high-security applications.

                            Key      Expanded   Effective   IV   Block
    Cipher           Type  Material Key Material  Key Bits  Size Size

    CAMELLIA_128_CBC Block   16         16         128       16    16
    CAMELLIA_256_CBC Block   32         32         256       16    16

3.2. Hash

    All the ciphersuites described here use SHA-1 [SHA-1] in an HMAC
    construction as described in section 5 of [TLS].

3.3. Key exchange

    The ciphersuites defined here differ in the type of certificate
    and key exchange method.  They use the following options:

    CipherSuite                               Key Exchange Algorithm
             
    TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA         RSA      
    TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA      DH_DSS   
    TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA      DH_RSA

    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA     DHE_RSA  
    TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA     DH_anon

    TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA     DHE_RSA  
    TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA     DH_anon  

    For the meanings of the terms RSA, DH_DSS, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS,
    DHE_RSA and DH_anon, please refer to sections 7.4.2 and 7.4.3 of
    [TLS].


4. Security Considerations 

    It is not believed that the new ciphersuites are ever less secure
    than the corresponding older ones.  Camellia is considered to be
    secure, and it has withstood extensive cryptanalytic efforts in
    several open, worldwide cryptographic evaluation projects
    [CRYPTREC][NESSIE].

    At the time of writing this document there are no known weak keys
    for Camellia.

    For other security considerations, please refer to the security
    considerations of the corresponding older ciphersuites described
    in [TLS] and [AES-TLS].

    Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed
