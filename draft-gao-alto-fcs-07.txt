                 ALTO Extension: Flow-based Cost Query
                         draft-gao-alto-fcs-07

Abstract

   ALTO cost maps and endpoint cost services map a source-destination
   pair into a cost value.  However, current filter specifications,
   which define the set of source-destination pairs in an ALTO query,
   have two limitations: 1) Only very limited address types are
   supported (IPv4 and IPv6), which is not sufficient to uniquely
   identify a flow in networks with fine-grained routing, such as the
   emerging Software Defined Networks; 2) The base ALTO protocol only
   defines filters enumerating all sources and all destinations, leading
   to redundant information in the response; 3) Cannot distinguish
   transmission types of flows in the query, which makes the server hard
   to respond the accurate resource consumption.  To address these three
   issues, this document extends the base ALTO protocol with a more
   fine-grained filter type which allows ALTO clients to select only the
   concerned source-destination pairs and announce the flow-specific
   information like data transmission type, and a more expressive
   address space which allows ALTO clients to make queries beyond the
   limited IP addresses.

1.  Introduction

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol [RFC7285]
   defines several cost query services, like Filtered Cost Map and
   Endpoint Cost Service, to allow applications to query path costs.
   Generally, an ALTO cost query service can be regarded as a function
   transforming a given subset of a specific query space into a network
   view abstract, where the subset is specified by a PID filter or an
   endpoint filter.  However, the current specification has some
   limitations.

   First, in the base ALTO protocol [RFC7285], the endpoint filter only
   contains the source and destination IP addresses.  In practice, both
   Internet Service Providers (ISP) and local network administrators may
   conduct policy-based routing, e.g., P2P traffic may be constrained
   and has a smaller bandwidth than HTTP traffic.  Also, web services
   with different QoS requirements may be hosted on the same machine
   with the same IP address but different paths with different QoS
   metrics.

   Second, in the base ALTO protocol [RFC7285], the query space is
   defined by a source list and a destination list.  For a query with N
   sources and M destinations, the response contains N*M entries.  While
   such a query schema is well suited for peer-to-peer (P2P)
   applications where files of the same seed are stored on all hosts, it
   may lead to a lot of redundancy in use cases such as modern data
   analytics systems where replicas of the same dataset are stored on
   only a small subset of servers.  Consider a system where the number



Zhang, et al.           Expires 16 September 2020               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                  ALTO-FCS                      March 2020


   of replicas is 3 (the default in HDFS), jointly scheduling N
   concurrent transfers only needs a maximum of 3N entries but the base
   ALTO protocol may return up to N^2 entries.

   Third, in the base ALTO protocol [RFC7285], the query does not
   distinguish among the different transmission types like unicast and
   multicast.  For some use cases like the multi-flow scheduling
   demonstrated by [I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector], the data transmission
   between endpoints could be beyond unicast.  And in those cases,
   different transmission types may affect the network resource
   consumption.  If applications can receive the path costs
   distinguishing the different transmission types, it can help
   applications perform their data transmission decision better.

   Thus, we conclude that the following additional requirements (AR)
   MUST be satisfied to allow ALTO clients make more accurate and
   efficient cost queries.

   AR-1:  The ALTO server SHOULD allow the ALTO client to specify
      accurate query space in cost query services.

      The base ALTO protocol only includes IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as
      endpoint address types, which may not be sufficient to accurately
      identify an endpoint with emerging flow-based routing mechanisms.
      ALTO clients MAY suffer from suboptimal decisions because of such
      inaccuracy.  Thus, the ALTO protocol SHOULD be extended so that
      clients are able to specify accurate query space, i.e., using more
      fine-grained endpoint address types.

   AR-2:  The ALTO server SHOULD allow the ALTO client to specify only
      the essential query space.

      Existing PIDFilter (see Sec 11.3.2.3 in [RFC7285]) and
      EndpointFilter (see Sec 11.5.1.3 in [RFC7285]) represent the
      cross-product of sources and destinations, and can introduce a lot
      of redundancy in certain use cases.  This limitation greatly harms
      the scalability of the ALTO protocol.  Thus, the ALTO protocol
      SHOULD be extended so that ALTO clients are able to specify only
      the essential cost query space, i.e., the concerned source-
      destination pairs.

   AR-3:  The ALTO server SHOULD allow the ALTO client to specify
      different data transmission types for transimissions in the query
      space.

      The input parameters of existing ALTO cost query services only
      allow the ALTO client to specify the queried transmissions by
      sources and destinations.  The transmission between each source

Internet-Draft                  ALTO-FCS                      March 2020


      and destination will always be considered as the unicast.  This
      limitaiton may make the ALTO client lose the accurate available
      resources.  Thus, the ALTO protocol SHOULD be extended so that
      ALTO clients are able to speicfy different transmission types.

   In this document, we describe an ALTO extension specifying flow-based
   cost queries.  The rest of this document is organized as follows.
   Section 3 introduces several new address types that extend the query
   space of ALTO cost services.  Section 5 describes the extended schema
   on Filtered Cost Map (FCM) and Endpoint Cost Service (ECS) to support
   cost queries of arbitrary source-destination combinations with the
   optional flow-specific information.  Section 6 and Section 7 discuss
   security and IANA considerations.

1.1.  Requirement Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.2.  Terminology

   This document uses the same terms as defined in [RFC7285] and
   [RFC8189] with the following additional term:

1.2.1.  Flow

   In this document, a flow refers to all communications between two
   endpoints.  A flow is "valid" if and only if there CAN be valid
   communications between the two endpoints, which oftentimes requires
   that that two endpoint addresses have compatible address types.

1.2.2.  Data Transmission Type

   This document use the term "Data Transmission Type" or "Transmission
   Type" to indicate how an application sends the network flows.  See
   Section 4.2.

2.  Overview of Approaches

   This section presents a non-normative overview of the extension to
   support flow-based cost query.  It assumes the readers are familiar
   with Filtered Cost Map and Endpoint Cost Service defined in [RFC7285]
   and their extensions defined in [RFC8189].

2.1.  Extended Endpoint Address

   To allow ALTO clients specify accurate query space in cost query
   services (AR-1), this document defines several new endpoint address
   types.  An endpoint address with a new type is referred to as an
   extended endpoint address.

   Since the address types of both the source and the destination
   correspond to the same network flow, they MUST NOT conflict.  This
   document defines an address type conflict table to indicate
   conflicts.  If some source and destination address types in a query
   conflict with each others, an ALTO server MUST return the
   corresponding error.

2.2.  Flow-based Filter

   To allow ALTO clients specify only the essential query space in cost
   query services (AR-2), both PIDFilter and EndpointFilter in the base
   protocol MUST be extended.  The extended filters are referred to as
   flow-based filters.

   A straight-forward way of satisfying AR-2 is to have an ALTO client
   list all its concerned flows.  Despite its simplicity, it MAY be too
   large in size, especially when many flows have common sources or
   common destinations in the query.  Also from the implementation's
   perspective, it cannot reuse the functionality to parse a PIDFilter/
   EndpointFilter.

   Thus, the flow-based filters defined in this document allow ALTO
   clients to include multiple PIDFilter/EndpointFilter objects in the
   same query.  Apparently, if we replace each PIDFilter/EndpointFilter
   of N sources and M destinations with NM filters that have exactly one
   source and destination, the two representations refer to the same set
   of flows.  As a result, one can aggregate flows with common sources
   or destinations in one PIDFilter/EndpointFilter object without
   introducing redundant flows.

   From the implementation's perspective, one MAY reuse an ALTO library
   which parses PIDFilter/EndpointFilter and/or converts them into a set
   of source-destination pairs.

2.3.  Flow-specific Announcement

   Some properties are only related to the transmission and cannot be
   encoded into endpoints, e.g., the data transmission type of a flow.
   However, these properties may help the ALTO client get more accurate
   costs.

Internet-Draft                  ALTO-FCS                      March 2020


   To allow the ALTO client to specify these flow-specific properties
   (AR-3), this document introduces an extensible field in the flow-
   based filter.  The ALTO client can announce the flow-specific
   information in this field.  An announcement, whose type is encoded as
   a FlowSpecAnnounceType (Section 4.1), can represent transmission
   type, equal cost multipath assumption and other kinds of flow-
   specific information.

   This document adopts an extensible design for this announcement
   field.  Although only the data transmission type is defined in this
   document, other announcement properties can be defined in future
   documents and are not in the scope of this document.

3.  Extended Endpoint Address

   This document registers new address types and defines the
   corresponding formats for endpoint addresses of each new address
   type.

3.1.  Address Type

   The new AddressType identifiers defined in this document are as
   follows:

   eth:  An endpoint address with type "eth" is the address of an
      Ethernet interface.  It is used to uniquely identify an endpoint
      in the data link layer.

   domain:  An endpoint address with type "domain" is the domain name of
      a web service.  It is used to uniquely identify a web service
      which MAY be translated to one or more IPv4 address(es).

   domain6:  An endpoint address with type "domain6" is the domain name
      of a web service.  It is used to uniquely identify a web service
      which MAY be translated to one or more IPv6 address(es).

   tcp:  An endpoint address with type "tcp" is the address of a TCP
      socket.  It is used to uniquely identify an IPv4 TCP socket in the
      transport layer.

   tcp6:  An endpoint address with type "tcp6" is the address of a TCP
      socket.  It is used to uniquely identify an IPv6 TCP socket in the
      transport layer.

   udp:  An endpoint address with type "udp" is the address of a UDP
      socket.  It is used to uniquely identify an IPv4 UDP socket in the
      transport layer.

Internet-Draft                  ALTO-FCS                      March 2020


   udp6:  An endpoint address with type "udp6" is the address of a UDP
      socket.  It is used to uniquely identify an IPv6 UDP socket in the
      transport layer.

3.2.  Endpoint Address

   This document defines EndpointAddr when AddressType is in
   Section 7.1.

3.2.1.  MAC Address

   An Endpoint Address of type "eth" is encoded as a MAC address, whose
   format is encoded as specified by either format EUI-48 in [EUI48] or
   EUI-64 in [EUI64].

3.2.2.  Internet Domain Name

   An Endpoint Address of type "domain" or "domain6" is encoded as a
   domain name in the Internet, as specified in Section 11 of [RFC2181].
   It MUST have at least one corresponding A ("domain") or AAAA
   ("domain6") record in the DNS.

3.2.3.  IPv4 Socket Address

   An Endpoint Address of type "tcp" or "udp" is encoded as an IPv4
   socket address.  It is encoded as a string of the format Host:Port
   with the ":" character as a separator.  The Host component of an IPv4
   socket address is encoded as specified by either an IPv4 address (see
   Section 10.4.3.1 of [RFC7285]) or an IPv4-compatible domain name (see
   Section 3.2.2).  The Port component of an IPv4 socket address is
   encoded as an integer between 1 and 65535.

3.2.4.  IPv6 Socket Address

   An Endpoint Address of type "tcp6" or "udp6" is encoded as an IPv6
   socket address.  It is also encoded as a string of the format
   Host:Port with the ":" character as a separator.  The Host component
   of an IPv6 socket address is encoded as specified by either an IPv6
   address (see Section 10.4.3.2 of [RFC7285]) enclosed in the "[" and
   "]" characters as recommended in [RFC2732] or an IPv6-compatible
   domain name (see Section 3.2.2).  The Port component of IPv6 socket
   address is encoded as an integer between 1 and 65535.

3.3.  Address Type Compatibility

   In practice, a flow with endpoint addresses with different types MAY
   NOT be valid.  For example, a source endpoint with an IPv4 address
   CANNOT establish a network connection with a destination endpoint
   with an IPv6 address.  Neither can a source with a TCP socket address
   and a destination with a UDP socket address.

   Thus, to explicitly define the compatibility between AddressType
   identifiers, every ALTO AddressType identifier MUST provide a list of
   AddressType identifiers that are compatible with it in the "ALTO
   Address Type Compatibility Registry" Section 7.2.  For all sources
   and destinations in a PIDFilter/EndpointFilter, if the AddressType
   identifiers of a given pair DO NOT appear in the ALTO Address Type
   Compatibility Registry, an ALTO server MUST return an ALTO error
   response with the error code "E_INVALID_FIELD_VALUE" with optional
   information to help diagnose the incompatibility.

3.4.  Examples

   Some valid endpoint addresses are demonstrated as follows:

       "eth:98-e0-d9-9c-df-81"
       "domain:www.example.com"
       "tcp:198.51.100.34:5123"
       "udp6:[2000::1:2345:6789:abcd]:8080"

4.  Flow-specific Announcement

   Each flow-specific announcement refers to a property of the traffic
   between a set of source and destination pairs.  The interpretation of
   a property, however, depends on the meaning, i.e., the type, of the
   property.  This document uses flow-specific announcement type as an
   indicator of the "type" information, and requires the flow-specific
   announcement types be registered in an IANA registry called "ALTO
   Flow-specific Announcement Registry".

4.1.  Flow-specific Announcement Type

   It is encoded as a JSONString and has the same format as a PID Name
   defined in Section 10.1 in [RFC7285].  The type FlowSpecAnnounceType
   is used in this document to indicate a string of that format.

Internet-Draft                  ALTO-FCS                      March 2020


4.2.  Data Transmission Type Announcement

   This document defines a flow-specific announcement called the data
   transmission type.  The type of this announcement is indicated by the
   string "transmission-type", and the value of this announcement is a
   JSONString of either "unicast", "anycast", "broadcast" or
   "multicast".

5.  Extended Cost Query Filters

   This section describes extensions to [RFC7285] and [RFC8189] to
   support flow-based cost queries.

   This document uses the notation rules specified in Section 8.2 of
   [RFC7285] and also the notation rules for optional fields in
   Section 4 of [RFC8189].

5.1.  Filtered Cost Map Extension

   This document extends the Filtered Cost Map as defined in
   Section 11.3.2 of [RFC7285] and Section 4.1 of [RFC8189], by adding a
   new capability and new input parameters.

   The media type, HTTP method, and "uses" specifications (described in
   Sections 11.3.2.1, 11.3.2.2, and 11.3.2.5 of [RFC7285], respectively)
   are not changed.

   The format of the response is the same as defined in Section 4.1.3 of
   [RFC8189].  But this document recommends how to generate the response
   based on the extended input parameters.

5.1.1.  Capabilities

   The Filtered Cost Map capabilities are extended with two additional
   members:

   *  flow-based-filter

   *  flow-spec-announce

   The capability "flow-based-filter" indicates whether this resource
   supports flow-based cost queries, and the capability "flow-spec-
   announce" indicates which flow-specific announcements are supported.
   The FilteredCostMapCapabilities object in Section 4.1.1 of [RFC8189]
   is extended as follows:

       object {
         JSONString cost-type-names<1..*>;
         [JSONBool cost-constraints;]
         [JSONNumber max-cost-types;]
         [JSONString testable-cost-type-names<1..*>;]
         [JSONBool flow-based-filter;]
         [FlowSpecAnnounceType flow-spec-announce<1..*>;]
       } FilteredCostMapCapabilities;

   cost-type-names and cost-constraints:  As defined in Section 11.3.2.4
      of [RFC7285].

   max-cost-types and testable-cost-type-names:  As defined in
      Section 4.1.1 of [RFC8189].

   flow-based-filter:  If true, an ALTO Server allows a field "pid-
      flows" to be included in the requests.  If not present, this field
      MUST be interpreted as if it is false.

   flow-spec-announce:  It MUST NOT be present if "flow-based-filter" is
      not true.  If present, the value is the an array of supported
      flow-specific announcement types.

5.1.2.  Accept Input Parameters

   The ReqFilteredCostMap object in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC8189] is
   extended as follows:

       object {
         [CostType cost-type;]
         [CostType multi-cost-types<1..*>;]
         [CostType testable-cost-types<1..*>;]
         [JSONString constraints<0..*>;]
         [JSONString or-constraints<1..*><1..*>;]
         [PIDFilter     pids;]
         [ExtPIDFilter  pid-flows<1..*>;]
       } ReqFilteredCostMap;

       object {
         [FlowSpecAnnounceMap flow-spec-announce;]
       } ExtPIDFilter : PIDFilter;

       object-map {
         FlowSpecAnnounceType -> JSONValue;
       } FlowSpecAnnounceMap;

   cost-type, multi-cost-types, testable-cost-types, constraints, or-
   constraints: As defined in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC8189].

Internet-Draft                  ALTO-FCS                      March 2020


   pids:  As defined in Section 11.3.2.3 of [RFC7285].

   pid-flows:  Defined as a list of ExtPIDFilter objects.  The ALTO
      server MUST interpret PID pairs appearing in multiple ExtPIDFilter
      objects as if they appeared only once.  If the capability "flow-
      spec-announce" is present, the "flow-spec-announce" input
      parameter can be specified.  The value of this field is of type
      FlowSpecAnnounceMap, which maps a FlowSpecAnnounceType to its
      corresponding value.  The interpretation of the value MUST follow
      the definition of the flow-specific announcement in the ALTO Flow-
      specific Announcement Registry.

   An ALTO client MUST include either "pids" or "pid-flows" in a query
   but MUST NOT include both at the same time.

5.2.  Response

   This document does not change the format of the response entity.  But
   the ALTO server responds the request with "pid-flows" filter as
   follows:

   The ALTO server MUST include the path costs of pairs in each
   ExtPIDFilter in the "pid-flows" filter.  If the "flow-spec-announce"
   field is specified in some ExtPIDFilter, the path costs for flows in
   this ExtPIDFilter SHOULD respond the flow-specific information
   announced by this field.

5.3.  Endpoint Cost Service Extension

   This document extends the Endpoint Cost Service as defined in
   Section 11.5.1 of [RFC7285] and Section 4.2 of [RFC8189], by adding a
   new capability and input parameters.

   The media type, HTTP method, and "uses" specifications (described in
   Sections 11.5.1.1, 11.5.1.2, and 11.5.1.5 of [RFC7285], respectively)
   are unchanged.

   The format of the response is the same as defined in Section 4.2.3 of
   [RFC8189].  But this document recommends how to generate the response
   based on the extended input parameters.

5.3.1.  Capabilities

   The extension to EndpointCostCapabilities includes three additional
   members:

   *  flow-based-filter

   *  address-types

   *  flow-spec-announce

   Only if the capability "flow-based-filter" is present and its value
   is "true", the ALTO server supports the flow-based extension for this
   endpoint cost service.  The capability "address-types" indicates
   which endpoint address types are supported by this resource, it MUST
   NOT be specified if "flow-based-filter" is absent or the value is
   false.  The capability "flow-spec-announce" indicates which flow-
   specific announcements are supported, just like it works in the
   Filtered Cost Map resource.

       object {
         [JSONBool    flow-based-filter;]
         [JSONString  address-types<0..*>;]
         [FlowSpecAnnounceType flow-spec-announce<1..*>;]
       } EndpointCostCapabilities : FilteredCostMapCapabilities;

   flow-based-filter:  If true, an ALTO Server MUST accept field
      "endpoint-flows" in the requests.  If not present, this field MUST
      be interpreted as if it is specified false.

   address-types:  Defines a list of AddressType identifiers encoded as
      a JSONArray of JSONString.  All AddressType identifiers MUST be
      registered in the "ALTO Address Type Registry" (see Section 14.4
      of [RFC7285]).  An ALTO server SHOULD NOT claim "ipv4" and "ipv6"
      in this field explicitly, because they are supported by default.
      If not present, this field MUST be interpreted as if it is an
      empty array, i.e., the ALTO server only supports the default
      "ipv4" and "ipv6" address types.

   flow-spec-announce:  It MUST NOT be present if "flow-based-filter" is
      not true.  If present, the value is the an array of supported
      flow-specific announcement types.

5.3.2.  Accept Input Parameters

   The ReqEndpointCostMap object in Section 4.2.2 of [RFC8189] is
   extended as follows:

         [EndpointFilter    endpoints;]
         [ExtEndpointFilter endpoint-flows<1..*>;]
       } ReqEndpointCostMap;

       object {
         [FlowSpecAnnounceMap flow-spec-announce;]
       } ExtEndpointFilter : EndpiontFilter;

   cost-type, multi-cost-types, testable-cost-types, constraints, or-
   constraints:
      As defined in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC8189].

   endpoints:  As defined in Section 11.5.1.3 of [RFC7285].

   endpoint-flows:  Defined as a list of ExtEndpointFilter objects.  The
      ALTO server MUST interpret endpoint pairs appearing in multiple
      ExtEndpointFilter objects as if they appeared only once.  If the
      capability "flow-spec-announce" is present, the "flow-spec-
      announce" input parameter can be specified.  The interpretation of
      this field is the same as in Section 5.1.2.

   If the AddressType of the source and destination in the same
   EndpointFilter do not conform the compatibility rule defined in
   Table 1 of Section 7.1, an ALTO server MUST return an ALTO error
   response with the error code "E_INVALID_FIELD_VALUE".

   An ALTO client MUST specify either "endpoints" or "endpoint-flows",
   but MUST NOT specify both in the same query.

5.4.  Response

   This document does not change the format of the response entity.  But
   the ALTO server responds the request with "pid-flows" filter as
   follows:

   The ALTO server MUST include the path costs of pairs in each
   ExtPIDFilter in the "pid-flows" filter.  If the "flow-spec-announce"
   field is specified in some ExtPIDFilter, the path costs for flows in
   this ExtPIDFilter SHOULD respond the flow-specific information
   announced by this field.  Especially, if "transmission-type" is
   specified as "multicast", the ALTO server SHOULD expose all the
   destination address as a multicast group address, and append the

   shared trees to the multicast destination addresses into the response
   if possible.

5.5.  Examples

5.5.1.  Information Resource Directory

   The following is an example of IRD with relevant resources of the
   ALTO server.  It provides a default network map, a property map of
   "ane" domain, a filtered cost map and two endpoint cost resources.
   All of three cost query resources (filtered cost map and endpoint
   cost resources) support "flow-based-filter".  One endpoint cost
   resource support "flow-spec-announce" and the compound query
   extension defined in I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector.

   Examples followed this section use the same IRD in this document.

   This example shows how an ALTO client requests a filtered cost map

5.5.4.  Flow-based Endpoint Cost Service Example #2

   This example shows the integration of the path vector extension and
   the flow-based query.  And in this example, the ALTO client specifies
   the flow from "tcp6:203.0.113.45:54321" to
   "tcp6:group1.example.com:21" is multicast.  So the ALTO server will
   expose the destination IP as a multicast group IP, and find the
   multicast destinations "fe80::40e:9594:da3d:34b" and
   "fe80::826:daff:feb8:1bb".  Then the ALTO server will append the cost
   for the shared tree into the "endpoint-cost-map".

6.  Security Considerations

   As discussed in Section 15.4 of [RFC7285], an ALTO server or a third
   party who is able to intercept the flow-based cost query messages MAY
   store and process the obtained information in order to analyze user
   behaviors and communication patterns.  Since flow-based cost queries
   MAY potentially provide more accurate information, an ALTO client
   should be cognizant about the trade-off between redundancy and
   privacy.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines new address types to be registered to an
   existing ALTO registry, and a new registry for their compatible
   address types.

7.1.  ALTO Address Type Registry

   This document defines several new address types to be registered to
   "ALTO Address Type Registry", listed in Table 1.

                         Table 2: ALTO Address Type
                           Compatibility Registry

   The entry of an address type identifier SHOULD only include the
   identifiers registered before it.  The compatibility between address
   types are bidirectional.  For example, although "eth" does not
   register "tcp" as its compatible identifier, an ALTO server MUST
   recognize them as compatible because "eth" is registered as a
   compatible identifier of "tcp".

   Any new ALTO address type identifier registered after this document
   MUST register their compatible identifiers in this registry
   simultaneously.

7.3.  ALTO Flow-specific Announcement Registry

   This document proposes to create a new registry called "ALTO Flow-
   specific Announcement Registry", whose purpose is stated in
   Section 4.  An initial registry entry is also documented as shown in
   Table 3.
