Abstract 

   This draft is input to the KIDNS discussion.  The procedures defined 
   herein provide a general Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) mechanism 
   that leverages DNSSEC.  This is compatible with RFC 5280.

1. Introduction 

   This draft is not to be construed as direction from I*. It is the 
   output of an actual "interim" Bar BoF held at conference room H 
   located in Fairfax, Virginia after the IAB/IESG OAM workshop on 2010-
   10-13. 

   Certification Authorities (CAs) take great care to ensure that the 
   private key holder is associated with the domain name contained in 
   the certificate.  DNSSEC [RFC4033][RFC4034][RFC4035] offers an 
   opportunity to eliminate complicated off-line processes.  This 
   relationship can be easily demonstrated by having the zone 
   administrator for the domain name in question post the certificate 
   [RFC5280] in the DNS and digitally sign the resulting zone.  

   With the following hierarchy: 

                       +-------------+ 
                       | example.com | 
                       +-------------+ 
                        /           \ 
      +-----------------+            +-----------------+ 
      | foo.example.com |            | bar.example.com | 
      +-----------------+            +-----------------+ 

   Administrators of foo.example.com and bar.example.com can choose to 
   either trust the root (i.e., the signer of example.com) or another 
   entity that they have included in the DNS entry they control. 

1.1. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. Procedures 

   Perform a DNSSEC retrieval on the domain name, verifying the chain of 
   trust to a locally configured DNSSEC trust anchor. 

   If a Certification Authority (CA) certificate is returned, rather 
   than an end-entity (EE) certificate, construct a certification path. 
   It is a matter of local policy whether the CA certificate is accepted 
   as a trust anchor (TA) directly, or MUST chain to a currently 
   configured TA.  To differentiate CA certificates from EE 
   certificates, the CA certificate MUST include basic constraints 
   extension and the cA boolean MUST be set to true [RFC5280]. 

   If the application provides an EE certificate (e.g., Transport Layer 
   Security (TLS)) issued by this CA certificate, this means only 
   obtaining a Certificate Revocation List (CRL).  If no EE certificate 
   is available (e.g., Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions 
   (S/MIME)), then follow the Subject Information Access (SIA) extension 
   to obtain other certificates.  SHOULD be no more than one hop to the 
   EE certificate. 

   If an EE certificate is returned, the certificate is intended for 
   direct use with some application.  As above, it is a matter of local 
   policy whether this EE certificate is accepted as trusted directly, 
   or MUST chain to a currently configured TA. 

   Verify that the dNSName in the certificate's subject alternative name 
   extension [RFC5280] is consistent with the expected host name.   

   If the certificate contains a critical External Key Usage (EKU) or 
   Key Usage (KU) extension [RFC5280], verify that the key usages are 
   consistent with this application. 

3. Examples 

   For S/MIME [RFC5750][RFC5751], the originator wants to send to a 
   signed and encrypted email.  (For signatures, the originator does not 
   need the recipient's certificate.)  To encrypt the message, the 
   originator needs the recipient's key agreement or key transport 
   certificate.  To obtain the recipients certificate, the originator 
   composes the email, selects sign and encrypt, and hit send.  The mail 
   client/DNSSEC client reviews the local store and determines that no 
   certificate is available.  The mail client then queries the DNS to 
   determine whether certificates are available for that domain. 

   If a CERT resource record (RR) [RFC4398] is available, the mail 
   client examines the certificate to determine if it is a CA 
   certificate or end certificate.  For domains with multiple users, the

   certificate would be a CA certificate and would include a SIA 
   extension [RFC5280].  The mail client follows the URL in an access 
   description that asserts id-ad-caRepository, using the protocol 
   implied by the accessLocation URL.  For example, the mail client can 
   query the repository for certificates issued to john.doe@example.com.  
   If an appropriate certificate is available (and validates according 
   to local policy), the client can encrypt the message.  The originator 
   includes their own certificates in the message, so this process is 
   not required to validate or decrypt the original message or for a 
   response.  

   For TLS [RFC5246], when the TLS looks up the IP address in the DNS it 
   can also request the CERT RR.  If the certificate that is provided in 
   the TLS handshake matches the one retrieved from DNSSEC, then the 
   client can accept it as a trusted certificate for that site, provided 
   local policy allows this.  If the CA certificate is returned in the 
   TLS handshake, the TLS client can verify that the TLS server 
   certificate was issued under that CA. 

   For IPsec [RFC4301], the model is similar to TLS. 

4. Security Considerations 

   Like [RFC5280], trust and revocation configuration decisions will 
   affect the security of the system.  

   When CA certificates are returned, the proposed solution assumes that 
   the entire CA certificate is returned.  For EE certificates, a hash 
   could be returned instead of the entire certificate. 

   Need to say something caching versus revocation for optimization. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   None

   We'd like to thank the lovely Carly for bringing the libations during 
   the "interim" Bar BoF.  In addition, we'd like to thank Yuengling, 
   Anheuser-Busch, and Samuel Adams for all of their efforts.
