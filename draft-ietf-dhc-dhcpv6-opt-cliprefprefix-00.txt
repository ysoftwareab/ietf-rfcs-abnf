Abstract

   This document describes the Client Preferred Prefix option by which
   the client can specify its preferred prefixes on which the addresses 
   need to be allocated by the server.

1. Introduction

   Scenario 1: The client's link has multiple prefixes of different
   scopes and the administrator policy on the server insists that the 
   addresses need to be allocated on site-local prefixes only. The 
   client will not be able to communicate with a node that belongs to a 
   different site, as the server allocates only site-local addresses in 
   IAs.

   Scenario 2: The client's link has two prefixes: site-local and global.
   The administrator policy insists that addresses need to be allocated 
   on both the prefixes. All the nodes on a link will not communicate 
   with external sites and thus all of them do not require global

   addresses. However, the server allocates addresses on both the 
   prefixes and hence most of the global addresses are wasted.

   To overcome the problems described in Scenario 1 and 2, the client 
   can specify its preferred prefixes to the server using Client 
   Preferred Prefix option.

2.  Requirements

   The keywords  MUST, MUST NOT,  REQUIRED,  SHALL,  SHALL NOT,  SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT,  RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1]

3. Terminology

   This document uses terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCPv6 as defined
   in section "Terminology" of the DHCP specification.

4. Client Preferred Prefix option

   Client Preferred Prefix option is used by the client to specify its 
   preferred prefixes to the server.

   The format of the Client Preferred Prefix option is as shown below:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   option-code:   OPTION_CLIENT_PREF_PREFIX (tbd)

   option-len: total length of the prefix-len and subnet prefix lists 
                    and its encapsulated options.

   prefix-len: prefix length of the subnet address.

Internet-Draft    Client Preferred Prefix option for DHCPv6     Jun 2002


   subnet prefix: 'n' bytes of subnet prefix, where 'n' is minimum 
                    number of bytes required to refer 'prefix-len' bits 
                    of the prefix.
   
   client-pref-prefix-options: options associated with Client 
                    Preferred Prefix option.

5. Server Behavior

   If the server policy doesn't support client preferred prefix option, 
   then it can either send reply with OptionUnsupported in the 
   encapsulated error code option in client preferred prefix option or 
   allocate addresses based on its original policy. The server behavior 
   SHOULD be configurable by the administrator.
	
   If the server policy supports client preferred prefix option and if 
   this option contains one or more prefixes which are not valid for the 
   client's link, then, the server MUST send the reply with error code 
   NotOnLink. 

   If the server policy supports client preferred prefix option and all 
   the prefixes in this option are valid for the client's link, then the
   server MUST allocate addresses only on the prefixes specified in 
   client preferred prefix option encapsulated in the IAs.

6. Client Behavior

   If the client has received OptionUnsupported error, it can either
   choose the next server to send request, till the server list gets
   exhausted or it can start the configuration exchange as specified in 
   Section 18.1.1 of [2] without the client preferred prefix option.

   If the server list has exhausted then, it MUST start the configuration
   exchange as specified in Section 18.1.1 of [2] without the client 
   preferred prefix option.

   If the client has received the addresses with the prefixes that were 
   not specified in client preferred prefix option, it can release the 
   unwanted addresses.

7. Appearance of these options

   Client Preferred Prefix option MUST occur only in Request and Reply
   messages. This option MUST occur in Reply messages only if it
   encapsulates the Error code option.

   Client Preferred Prefix option MUST occur only as an encapsulated 
   option in the IA or IA_TA option.

   Client Preferred Prefix option MUST only have Error code option as the
   encapsulated option.

8. Security Considerations

   Since, this option can occur only in IA or IA_TA option, all the 
   IA-relevant security considerations are applicable to this option too.

   To avoid attacks through this option, the DHCP client SHOULD use 
   authenticated DHCP (see section "Authentication of DHCP messages" 
   in the DHCPv6 specification [2]).

9. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an option code to this option from the
   option-code space defined in section "DHCPv6 Options" of the DHCPv6
   specification [2].
