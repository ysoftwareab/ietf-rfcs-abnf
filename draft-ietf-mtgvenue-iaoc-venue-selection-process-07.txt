1.  Introduction

   [[ED: The issue tracker for this document can be found at
   https://github.com/elear/mtgvenue/issues/.]]

   The IAOC has responsibility for arranging IETF plenary meeting venue
   selection and operation.  The purpose of this document is to guide
   the IAOC in their selection of regions, cities, and facilities, and
   hotels.  The IAOC applies this guidance at different points in the
   process in an attempt to faithfully meet the requirements of the IETF
   community.  We specify a set of general criteria for venue selection
   and several requirements for transparency and community consultation.

   It remains the responsibility of the IAOC to apply their best
   judgment.  The IAOC accepts input and feedback both during the
   consultation process and later (for instance when there are changes
   in the situation at a chosen location).  Any appeals remain subject
   to the provisions of BCP101 [RFC4071].  As always, the community is
   encouraged to provide direct feedback to the NOMCOM, IESG, and IAB
   regarding the discharge of the IAOC's performance.

   Three terms describe the places for which the IETF contracts
   services:

   Venue:
      This is an umbrella term for the city, meeting resources and guest
      room resources.

   Facility:
      The building that houses meeting rooms and associated resources.
      It may also house an IETF Hotel.

   IETF Hotels:
      One or more hotels, in close proximity to the Facility, where the
      IETF guest room allocations are negotiated and IETF SSIDs are in
      use.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft               Venue Selection                    May 2017


2.  Venue Selection Objectives

2.1.  Core Values

   Some IETF values pervade the selection process.  These often are
   applicable to multiple requirements listed in this document.  They
   are not limited to the following, but at minimum include:

   Why do we meet?
      We meet to pursue the IETF's mission [RFC3935], partly by
      advancing the development of Internet-Drafts and RFCs.  We also
      seek to facilitate attendee participation in multiple topics and
      to enable cross-pollination of ideas and technologies.

   Inclusiveness:
      We would like to facilitate the onsite or remote participation of
      anyone who wants to be involved.

      Every country has limits on who it will permit within its borders.
      However the IETF seeks to:

      1.  Minimize situations in which onerous entry regulations prevent
          participants from attending meetings, or failing that to
          distribute meeting locations such that onerous entry
          regulations are not always experienced by the same attendees

      2.  Avoid meeting in countries with laws that effectively exclude
          people on the basis of race, religion, gender, sexual
          orientation, national origin, or gender identity

   Where do we meet?
      We meet in different locations globally, in order to spread the
      difficulty and cost of travel among active participants, balancing
      travel time and expense across the regions in which IETF
      participants are based.

   Internet Access:
      As an organization, we write specifications for the Internet, and
      we use it heavily.  Meeting attendees need unfiltered access to
      the general Internet and our corporate networks.  "Unfiltered
      access" in this case means that all forms of communication are
      allowed.  This includes, but is not limited to, access to
      corporate networks via encrypted VPNs from the meeting Facility
      and Hotels, including overflow hotels.  We also need open network
      access available at high enough data rates, at the meeting
      Facility, to support our work, including the support of remote
      participation.  Beyond this, we are the first users of our own
      technology.  Any filtering may cause a problem with that



Pelletier, et al.       Expires November 15, 2017               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               Venue Selection                    May 2017


      technology development.  In some cases, local laws may require
      some filtering.  We seek to avoid such locales without reducing
      the pool of cities to an unacceptable level by stating a number of
      criteria below, one mandatory and others important, to allow for
      the case where local laws may require filtering in some
      circumstances.[MeetingNet]

   Focus:
      We meet to have focused technical discussions.  These are not
      limited to scheduled breakout sessions, although of course those
      are important.  They also happen over meals or drinks -- including
      a specific type of non-session that we call a "Bar BOF" -- or in
      side meetings.  Environments that are noisy or distracting prevent
      that or reduce its effectiveness, and are therefore less desirable
      as a meeting Facility.

   Economics:
      Meeting attendees participate as individuals.  While many are
      underwritten by employers or sponsors, many are self-funded.  In
      order to reduce participation costs and travel effort, we
      therefore seek locations that provide convenient budget
      alternatives for food and lodging, and which minimize travel
      segments from major airports to the Venue.  Within reason, budget
      should not be a barrier to accommodation.

   Least Astonishment and Openness:
      Regular participants should not be surprised by meeting Venue
      selections, particularly when it comes to locales.  To avoid
      surprise, the venue selection process, as with all other IETF
      processes, should be as open as practicable.  It should be
      possible for the community to engage early to express its views on
      prospective selections, so that the community, IAOC, and IAD can
      exchange views as to appropriateness long before a venue contract
      is considered.

2.2.  Venue Selection Non-Objectives

   IETF meeting Venues are not selected or declined with the explicit
   purposes of:

   Politics:
      Endorsing or condemning particular countries, political paradigms,
      laws, regulations, or policies.

   Maximal attendance:
      While the IETF strives to be as inclusive as possible both online
      and in person, maximal meeting attendance in and of itself is not
      a goal.  It would defeat a key goal of meeting if active

Internet-Draft               Venue Selection                    May 2017


      contributors with differing points of view did not have the
      opportunity to resolve their disagreements, no matter how full the
      rooms.

   Tourism:
      Variety in site-seeing experiences.

3.  Meeting Criteria

   This section contains the criteria for IETF meetings.  It is broken
   down into three subsections: mandatory criteria, important criteria,
   and other considerations, each as explained below.

3.1.  Mandatory Criteria

   If criteria in this subsection cannot be met, a particular location
   is unacceptable for selection, and the IAOC MUST NOT enter into a
   contract.  Should the IAOC learn that a location no longer can meet a
   mandatory requirement after having entered into a contract, it will
   inform the community and address the matter on a case by case basis.

   o  The Facility MUST be assessed to be able to provide sufficient
      space in an appropriate layout to accommodate the expected number
      of people to attend that meeting.

   o  The Facility and IETF Hotels MUST provide wheelchair access to
      accommodate the number of people who are anticipated to require
      it.

   o  The venue MUST provide unfiltered access to the Internet, to the
      extent permitted by governing laws and regulations.

3.2.  Important Criteria

   The criteria in this subsection are not mandatory, but are still
   highly significant.  It may be necessary to trade one or more of
   these criteria off against others.  A Venue that meets more of these
   criteria is on the whole more preferable than another that meets less
   of these criteria.  Requirements classed as Important can also be
   balanced across Venue selections for multiple meetings.  When a
   particular requirement in this section cannot be met, the IAOC MUST
   notify the community at the time the venue is booked.  Furthermore,
   the IAOC is requested to assist those who, as a result, may be
   inconvenienced in some way.

Internet-Draft               Venue Selection                    May 2017


3.2.1.  Venue City Critera

   o  Travel to the Venue is acceptable based on cost, time, and burden
      for participants traveling from multiple regions.  It is
      anticipated that the burden borne will be generally shared over
      the course of multiple years.

   o  The Venue is assessed as favorable for obtaining a host and
      sponsors.  That is, the Meeting is in a location and at a price
      that it is possible and probable to find a host and sponsors.

   o  Travel barriers to entry, including visa requirements, are
      unlikely to impede attendance by an overwhelming majority of
      participants.

   o  Economic, safety, and health risks associated with this Venue are
      acceptable.

3.2.2.  Basic Venue Criteria

   The following requirements relate to the Venue and Facilities.

   The IETF operates internationally and adjusts to local requirements.
   Facilities selected for IETF Meetings conform with local health,
   safety and accessibility laws and regulations.  A useful discussion
   of related considerations in evaluating this criterion is at:
   <http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-
   conference-guide/>



      ***  Editor's Note  ***
         In the spirit of the 'international' focus, we need a
         comprehensive document that is similar to the one cited, but
         without a national focus.  The current reference is US-
         specific. /d

   In addition:

   o  There are sufficient places (e.g., a mix of hallways, bars,
      meeting rooms, and restaurants) for people to hold ad hoc
      conversations and group discussions in the combination of spaces
      offered by the facilities, hotels and bars/restaurants in the
      surrounding area, within walking distance (5-10').

   o  The cost of guest rooms, meeting space, meeting food and beverage
      is affordable, within the norms of business travel.

Internet-Draft               Venue Selection                    May 2017


   o  The Facility is accessible by people with disabilities.  While we
      mandate wheelchair accessibility, other forms are important, and
      should be provided to the extent possible, based on anticipated
      needs of the community.

3.2.3.  Technical Meeting Needs

   The following criteria relate to technical meeting needs.

   o  The Facility's support technologies and services -- network,
      audio-video, etc. -- are sufficient for the anticipated activities
      at the meeting, or the Facility is willing to add such
      infrastructure or these support technologies and services might be
      provided by a third party, all at no -- or at an acceptable --
      cost to the IETF.

   o  The Facility directly provides, or permits and facilitates, the
      delivery of a high performance, robust, unfiltered and unmodified
      IETF Network.

   o  The IETF Hotel(s) directly provide, or else permit and facilitate,
      the delivery of a high performance, robust, unfiltered and
      unmodified Internet service for the public areas and guest rooms;
      this service is typically included in the cost of the room.

3.2.4.  Hotel Needs

   The following criteria relate to IETF Hotels.

   o  The IETF Hotel(s) are within close proximity to each other and the
      Facility.

   o  The guest rooms at the IETF Hotel(s) are sufficient in number to
      house 1/3 or more of projected meeting attendees.

   o  Overflow Hotels can be placed under contract, within convenient
      travel time of the Facility and at a variety of guest room rates.

   o  The Venue environs include budget hotels within convenient travel
      time, cost, and effort.

   o  The IETF Hotel(s) are accessible by people with disabilities.
      While we mandate wheelchair accessibility, other forms are
      important, and should be provided to the extent possible, based on
      anticipated needs of the community.

   o  At least one IETF Hotel has a space for use as a lounge, conducive
      to planned and ad hoc meetings and chatting, as well as working

Internet-Draft               Venue Selection                    May 2017


      online.  There are tables with seating, convenient for small
      meetings with laptops.  These can be at an open bar or casual
      restaurant.  Preferably the lounge area is on the path between the
      meeting rooms and the hotel entrance, and is available all day and
      night.

3.2.5.  Food and Beverage

   It is said that an army travels on its stomach.  So too does the
   IETF.  The following criteria relate to food and beverage.

   o  The Venue environs, which includes both onsite, as well as areas
      within a reasonable walking distance or conveniently accessible by
      a short taxi ride or by local public transportation, have
      convenient and inexpensive choices for meals that can accommodate
      a wide range of dietary requirements.

   o  The Venue environs include grocery shopping that will accommodate
      a wide range of dietary requirements, within a reasonable walking
      distance, or conveniently accessible by a short taxi, bus, or
      subway ride, from the Facility and IETF Hotels.

   o  A range of attendee's health-related and religion-related dietary
      requirements can be satisfied with robust and flexible onsite
      service or through access to an adequate grocery.

3.3.  Other Consideraitons

   The following considerations are desirable, but not as important as
   the preceding requirements, and thus should not be traded off for
   them.

   We have something of a preference for an IETF meeting to be under
   "One Roof".  That is, qualified meeting space and guest rooms are
   available in the same facility.

   It is desirable for overflow hotels provide reasonable, reliable,
   unfiltered Internet service for the public areas and guest rooms;
   this service is included in the cost of the room.

   It is desirable to enter into a multi-event contract with the
   Facility and IETF Hotels to optimize meeting and attendee benefits,
   i.e., reduce administrative costs and reduce direct attendee costs,
   will be considered a positive factor.  Such a contract can be
   considered after at least one IETF meeting has been held at the
   Facility.

Internet-Draft               Venue Selection                    May 2017


   Particularly when we are considering a city for the first time, it is
   desirable to have someone who is familiar with both the locale and
   the IETF participate in the site selection process.  Such a person
   can provide guidance regarding safety, location of local services,
   and understanding best ways to get to and from the Venue, and local
   customs, as well as identify how our requirements are met.

4.  Venue Selection Roles

   The formal structure of IETF administrative support functions is
   documented in BCP 101 [RFC4071], [RFC4371], [RFC7691].  The reader is
   expected to be familiar with the entities and roles defined by that
   document, in particular for the IASA, ISOC, IAOC and IAD.  This
   section covers the meeting selection related roles of these and other
   parties that participate in the process.  Note that roles beyond
   meeting selection, e.g., actually running and reporting on meetings,
   are outside the scope of this document.

4.1.  IETF Participants

   While perhaps obvious, it is important to note that IETF meetings
   serve all those who contribute to the work of the IETF.  This
   includes those who attend meetings in person, from newcomer to
   frequent attendee, to those who participate remotely, as well as
   those who do not attend but contribute to new RFCs.  Potential new
   contributors are also considered in the process.

   Participants have a responsibility to express their views about
   venues early and often, by responding to surveys or other
   solicitations from the IAD or IAOC, and by initiating fresh input as
   the Participant becomes aware of changes in venues that have been
   reviews.  This permits those responsible for venue selection to be
   made aware of concerns relating to particular locations well in
   advance of having entered into contract discussions.

4.2.  IESG and IETF Chair

   The Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) comprises the IETF
   Area Directors and the IETF Chair.  Along with the IAB, the IESG is
   responsible for the management of the IETF, and is the standards
   approval board for the IETF, as described in BCP9 [RFC2026].  This
   means that the IESG sets high level policies related to, among other
   things, meeting venues.  The IETF Chair, among other things, relays
   these IESG-determined policies to the IAOC.  The IETF Chair is also a
   member of the IAOC.

4.3.  The Internet Society

   With respect to IETF meetings, the Internet Society (ISOC):

   o  Executes all Venue contracts on behalf of the IETF at the request
      of the IAOC

   o  Solicits meeting sponsorships

   o  Collects all meeting-related revenues, including registration
      fees, sponsorships, hotel commissions, and other miscellaneous
      revenues

   ISOC also provides accounting services, such as invoicing and monthly
   financial statements.

4.4.  IETF Administrative Oversight Committee

   The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) has the
   responsibility to oversee and select IETF meeting venues.  It
   instructs the IAD to work with the Internet Society to write the
   relevant contracts.  It approves the IETF meetings calendar.  In
   cooperation with the IAD, the IAOC takes necessary actions to ensure
   that it is aware of participant concerns about particular venues as
   early in the process as is feasible.

4.5.  IETF Administrative Support Activity

   The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) supports the meeting
   selection process.  This includes identifying, qualifying and
   reporting on potential meeting sites, as well as supporting meeting
   Venue contract negotiation.  The IETF Secretariat is part of the IASA
   under the management of the IAD.  The IAD takes appropriate actions
   to solicit community input regarding both retrospective and
   prospective feedback from participants.

4.6.  IETF Administrative Director

   The IETF Administrative Director (IAD) coordinates and supports the
   activities of the IETF Secretariat, the IAOC Meetings Committee and
   the IAOC to ensure the timely execution of the meeting process.  This
   includes participating in the IAOC Meeting Subcommittee and ensuring
   its efforts are documented, leading Venue contract negotiation, and
   coordinating contract execution with ISOC.  The meetings budget is
   managed by the IAD.

4.7.  IAOC Meeting Committee

   The fundamental purpose of the Meetings Committee is to participate
   in the Venue selection process, and to formulate recommendations to
   the IAOC regarding meeting sites.  It also tracks the meetings
   sponsorship program, recommends extraordinary meeting-related
   expenses, and recommends the IETF meetings calendar to the IAOC.  The
   charter of the committee is at: <https://iaoc.ietf.org/
   committees.html#meetings>.

   Membership in the Meetings Committee is at the discretion of the
   IAOC; it includes an IAOC appointed chair, the IETF Administrative
   Director (IAD), IAOC members, representatives from the Secretariat,
   and interested members of the community.

5.  Venue Selection Steps

   The following sequence is used by the IAOC to select venues.  Unless
   otherwise stated below, the IAOC may evolve these steps over time
   without updating this document.

5.1.  Identification

   Four years out, a process identifies cities that might be candidates
   for meetings.  For example:

   a.  The IAOC selects regions, cities, and dates for meetings.

   b.  A list of target cities per region is provided to the
       Secretariat, with host preferences, if known.

   c.  Potential venues in preferred cities are identified and receive
       preliminary investigation, including reviews of Official Advisory
       Sources, consultation with specialty travel services, frequent
       travelers and local contacts to identify possible barriers to
       holding a successful meeting in the target cities.

   d.  Investigated cities and findings are provided by the Secretariat
       to the Meetings Committee for further review.  Meetings Committee
       makes a recommendation to the IAOC of investigated/target cities
       to consider further as well as issues identified and the results
       of research conducted.

5.2.  Consultation

   The IAOC MUST consult the community about potential new venues prior
   to them being booked.  The timing and means by which it does so may
   vary over time, but MUST include references to any notable travel

   risks.  The consultation may overlap with the previous step
   (identification).

   For example:

   a.  The IAOC asks the community whether there are any barriers to
       holding a successful meeting in any of the target cities in the
       set.

   b.  Community responses are reviewed and concerns investigated by the
       Meetings Committee.  The results together with recommendations
       for whether each city should be considered as potential meeting
       location is provided to the IAOC.

   c.  The IAOC identifies which cities are to be considered as a
       potential meeting location.

   d.  On a public web page, the IAOC lists all candidate cities, when
       community input was solicited, and if a city is to be considered
       as a potential meeting location.

   e.  The Meetings Committee pursues potential meeting locations based
       on the posted list of cities that have been identified as a
       potential meeting locations.

5.3.  Qualification

   Visit:

   a.  Secretariat assesses "vetted" target cities to determine
       availability and conformance to criteria.

   b.  Meetings Committee approves potential cities for site
       qualification visit.

   c.  Site qualification visits are arranged by Secretariat and
       preliminary negotiations are undertaken with selected potential
       sites.

   d.  Site qualification visit is conducted using the checklist along
       the lines of what is included in Appendix A; the site visit team
       prepares a site report and discusses it with the Meetings
       Committee.

5.4.  Negotiation

   2.75 - 3 years out, initiate contract negotiations:

   a.  The Meetings Committee reviews the Venue options based on Venue
       selection criteria and recommends a Venue to the IAOC.  Only
       options that meet all Mandatory labeled criteria might be
       recommended.

   b.  IAOC selects a Venue for contracting as well as a back-up
       contracting Venue, if available.

   c.  Secretariat negotiates with selected Venue.  IAD reviews contract
       and requests IAOC and ISOC approval of contract and authority for
       Secretariat to execute contract on ISOC's behalf.

   d.  Contracts are executed.

   e.  The venue is announced.  At this time, the announcement MUST
       include any notable travel risks or references thereto.

5.5.  Late Changes

   If at any time after a contract is signed the IAOC learns where a
   Venue's circumstances have significantly changed, such that the
   Important or Mandatory criteria can no longer be met, the IAOC MUST
   reconsider the selection.  A description of how reconsideration
   currently takes place is found in Appendix B.  The IAOC will gauge
   the cost of making a change against the ability of the IETF to
   conclude a successful meeting, and make a final determination based
   on their best judgment.  When there is enough time to do so, the IAOC
   is expected to consult the community about changes.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo asks the IANA for no new parameters.

7.  Security Considerations

   This note proposes no protocols, and therefore no new protocol
   insecurities.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   This note reveals no personally identifying information apart from
   its authorship.
