Abstract 
    
   This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol 
   (LDAP) [RFC3377] bind [LDAPPROT] operation with a mechanism for 
   requesting and returning the authorization identity it establishes. 
   Specifically, this document defines the Authorization Identity 
   Request and Response controls for use with the Bind operation. 
    
    
1. Introduction 
    
   This document defines support for the Authorization Identity Request 
   Control and the Authorization Identity Response Control for 
   requesting and returning the authorization established in a bind 
   operation. The Authorization Identity Request Control may be 
   submitted by a client in a bind request if authenticating with 
   version 3 of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) 
   protocol [LDAPv3]. In the LDAP server's bind response, it may then 
   include an Authorization Identity Response Control. The response 
   control contains the identity assumed by the client. This is useful 
   when there is a mapping step or other indirection during the bind, so

   that the client can be told what LDAP identity was granted. Client 
   authentication with certificates is the primary situation where this 
   applies. Also, some Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) 
   authentication mechanisms may not involve the client explicitly 
   providing a DN, or may result in an authorization identity which is 
   different from the authentication identity provided by the client 
   [AUTH]. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" 
   used in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
   [RFCKeyWords]. 
    
    
2. Publishing support for the Authorization Identity Request Control 
   and the Authorization Identity Response Control 
    
   Support for the Authorization Identity Request Control and the 
   Authorization Identity Response Control is indicated by the presence 
   of the Object Identifiers (OIDs) 2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.16 and 
   2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.15, respectively, in the supportedControl 
   attribute [LDAPATTRS] of a server's root DSE. 
    
    
3. Authorization Identity Request Control 
    
    
   This control MAY be included in any bind request which specifies 
   protocol version 3, as part of the controls field of the LDAPMessage 
   as defined in [LDAPPROT]. In a multi-step bind operation, the client 
   MUST provide the control with each bind request. 
    
   The controlType is "2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.16" and the controlValue is 
   absent. 
    
    
4. Authorization Identity Response Control 
    
   This control MAY be included in any final bind response where the 
   first bind request of the bind operation included an Authorization 
   Identity Request Control as part of the controls field of the 
   LDAPMessage as defined in [LDAPPROT]. 
    
   The controlType is "2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.15". If the bind request   
   succeeded and resulted in an identity (not anonymous), the 
   controlValue contains the authorization identity (authzId), as 
   defined in [AUTH] section 9, granted to the requestor. If the bind 
   request resulted in an anonymous association, the controlValue field 
   is a string of zero length. If the bind request resulted in more than 
   one authzId, the primary authzId is returned in the controlValue 
   field. 
    
   The control is only included in a bind response if the resultCode for 
   the bind operation is success.

AUTHORIZATION IDENTITY BIND CONTROL                         April 2003 
 
 
    
   If the server requires confidentiality protections to be in place 
   prior to use of this control (see Security Considerations), the 
   server reports failure to have adequate confidentiality protections 
   in place by returning the confidentialityRequired result code. 
    
   If the client has insufficient access rights to the requested 
   authorization information, the server reports this by returning the 
   insufficientAccessRights result code. 
    
   Identities presented by a client as part of the authentication 
   process may be mapped by the server to one or more authorization 
   identities. The bind response control can be used to retrieve the 
   primary authzId. 
    
   For example, during client authentication with certificates [AUTH], a 
   client may possess more than one certificate and not be able to 
   determine which one was ultimately selected for authentication to the 
   server. The subject DN field in the selected certificate may not 
   correspond exactly to a DN in the directory, but rather have gone 
   through a mapping process controlled by the server. On completing the 
   certificate-based authentication, the client may issue a SASL [SASL] 
   bind request, specifying the EXTERNAL mechanism and including an 
   Authorization Identity Request Control. The bind response MAY include 
   an Authorization Identity Response Control indicating the DN in the 
   server's DIT which the certificate was mapped to. 
    
    
5. Alternative Approach with Extended Operation 
    
   The LDAP "Who am I?" [AUTHZID] extended operation provides a 
   mechanism to query the authorization identity associated with a bound 
   connection. Using an extended operation as opposed to a bind response 
   control allows a client to learn the authorization identity after the 
   bind has has established integrity and data confidentiality 
   protections. The disadvantages of the extended operation approach are 
   coordination issues between "Who am I?" requests, bind requests, and 
   other requests, and that an extra operation is required to learn the 
   authorization identity. For multithreaded or high bandwidth server 
   application environments, the bind response approach may be 
   preferable. 
    
6. Security Considerations 
    
   The Authorization Identity Request and Response Controls are subject 
   to standard LDAP security considerations. The controls may be passed 
   over a secure as well as over an insecure channel. They are not 
   protected by security layers negotiated by the bind operation. 
    
   The response control allows for an additional authorization identity 
   to be passed. In some deployments, these identities may contain 
   confidential information which require privacy protection. In such

   deployments, a security layer should be established prior to issuing 
   a bind request with an Authorization Identity Request Control. 
    
    
7. IANA Considerations 
    
   The OIDs 2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.16 and 2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.15 are 
   reserved for the Authorization Identity Request and Response 
   Controls, respectively. The Authorization Identity Request Control is 
   to be registered as an LDAP Protocol Mechanism [IANALDAP].
