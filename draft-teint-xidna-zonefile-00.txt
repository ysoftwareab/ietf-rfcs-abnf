              An X-IDNA Profile for DNS Zone Master Files
                     draft-teint-xidna-zonefile-00

Abstract

   While the Domain Name System (DNS) has allowed any octets in labels
   and ressource records since its inception, traditionally, addresses
   used for hostnames, email addresses, and other names actuall used in
   the DNS were limited to ASCII characters.

   This memo defines an extension to allow the use of a wide range of
   internationalised addresses that need to be converted to ACE form on
   the wire, including domain names and email addresses in zone master
   files, without removing the ability to include arbitrary octets.

Internet-Draft  X-IDNA Profile for DNS Zone Master Files      March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The X-IDNA base specification ([I-D.teint-xidna-base]) provides a
   generic framework for internationalisation of addresses, based on
   IDNA.  This memo defines an X-IDNA Profile for use with DNS zone
   master files, as defined in Section 5 of [RFC1035].

   It also defines the charset encoding for zone files.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft  X-IDNA Profile for DNS Zone Master Files      March 2010


2.  Profile Definition

2.1.  Applicability

   This X-IDNA Profile applies to "<domain-name>" syntax elements
   defined in section 5.1 of [RFC1035]

2.2.  Normalisation

   The "<domain-name>" syntax elements MUST be normalised in a way that
   satisfies the following conditions:
   o  Numeric escapes ("\DDD", [RFC1035], Section 5.1) MUST NOT encode
      label characters ([I-D.teint-xidna-base], Section 4.5).
   o  Numeric escapes ("\DDD", [RFC1035], Section 5.1) MUST be be
      separated from subsequent label characters.  Implementatiosn MAY
      simply insert a "\" (U+002F) after the numeric escape sequence or
      they MAY treat the whole sequence as a separator.
   o  A "\" (U+002F) character MUST NOT appear between two label
      characters ([I-D.teint-xidna-base], Section 4.5).

   This can be achieved by doing the following substitutions, in this
   order:
   1.  In sequences of an unquoted "\" (U+002F) followed by an ASCII
       letter (U+0041..U+005A, U+0061..U+007A) or a HYPHEN-MINUS
       (U+002D), the "\" is removed.
   2.  A sequence of an unquoted "\" (U+002F) followed by three ASCII
       digits that, if interpreted as an octal number, represent an
       ASCII letter (U+0041..U+005A, 0+0061..U+007A), ASCII digit
       (U+0030..U+0039) or HYPHEN-MINUS (U+002D), is replaced with that
       character.
   3.  Between a sequences of an unquoted "\" (U+002F) followed by any
       other combination of three ASCII digits and a succeeding ASCII
       letter (U+0041..U+005A, 0+0061..U+007A), ASCII digit (U+0030..U+
       0039) or HYPHEN-MINUS (U+002D), an additional "\" is inserted.
   NOTE: Implementations must take care that 'unquoted "\" (U+002F)'
   means neither 'any "\"' nor 'any "\" not preceeded by another "\"'.
   For example, in the sequences "\\\A" and "\\A", the first and third
   character are unquoted; these sequences encode the same string and
   would both map to "\\A".

2.3.  Validation

   Validation of domain-names used as host names is subject to the the
   Registration Protocol described in Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-idnabis-protocol].

   Validation of domain-names not used as host names depends on the type
   of data encoded as a domain name.  It is expected that when the named

   is entered into a zonefile, it refers to an address defined elsewhere
   and thus already has been validated.  For example, the RNAME field of
   the SOA record refers to an email address that has already been
   created on a mail server.  Therefore, not additional validation is
   required.

3.  Zone File Charset

   Zone master files SHOULD use the UTF-8 charset defined in [RFC2279].

   Implementations MAY also allow and detect UTF-16 and and UTF-32
   (Section 2.5 of [Unicode]) character encodings.

   A BOM (U+FEFF) at the beginning ot a master file SHOULD be removed.

Internet-Draft  X-IDNA Profile for DNS Zone Master Files      March 2010


4.  Arbitrary Octets

   Arbitrary octets can be embedded in domain-names using the "\DDD"
   escape mechanism defined in Section 5.1 of [RFC1035], i.e. by using a
   "\", followed by a three-digit octal representation of that
   characters.

   The normalisation ensures that these escaped characters are passed
   through the X-IDNA processing as-is.  When all X-IDNA labels have
   been converted to ACE form, the zone can be inserted into the
   server's database normally, decoding the octets during the
   converstion to binary form.
