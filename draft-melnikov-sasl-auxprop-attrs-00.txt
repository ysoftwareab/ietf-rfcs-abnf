Internet DRAFT                    SASL                      2 April 2004


Abstract

   The CMU SASL implementation of the RFC 2222 defines an API for auxiliary
   properties (auxprop) plugins. Auxprop plugins can store properties.
   A property can be a user password in cleartext or in a hashed form
   used by a particular SASL mechanism, or any other information
   associated with the user. This document describes a schema for the
   storage of auxprop properties in an LDAP directory server.

2.    SASL related Attribute Types


   This document defines the attribute types cmusaslsecretCRAM-MD5,
   cmusaslsecretDIGEST-MD5, cmusaslsecretOTP and cmusaslsecretSRP. Their
   definition is provided below.


   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.3.8.1.1.1
           NAME 'cmusaslsecretCRAM-MD5'
           DESC 'Prehashed password as described in CRAM-MD5'
        EQUALITY octetStringMatch
           SINGLE-VALUE
           SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40{32} )

   cmusaslsecretCRAM-MD5 attribute contains the binary representation of
   the following C structure:

   typedef struct HMAC_MD5_STATE_s {
       UINT4 ipad_state[4];
       UINT4 opad_state[4];



A. Melnikov                                             FORMFEED[Page 2]





Internet DRAFT                    SASL                      2 April 2004


   } HMAC_MD5_STATE;

   i.e. 16 bytes (4 element array of 32bit integers, each element in
   network byte order) of ipad is followed by 16 bytes (4 element array
   of 32bit integers, each element in network byte order) of opad. ipad
   and opad are calculated as defined in [SASL-CRAM].

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.3.8.1.1.2
           NAME 'cmusaslsecretDIGEST-MD5'
           DESC 'Shared secret for DIGEST-MD5'
        EQUALITY octetStringMatch
           SINGLE-VALUE
           SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40{16} )

   The cmusaslsecretDIGEST-MD5 attribute contains the binary
   representation of SS (16-octets) as defined in section 2.1.2.1 of
   [SASL-DIGEST]:

   SS = H( { unq(username-value), ":", unq(realm-value), ":", passwd } )


   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.3.8.1.1.3
           NAME 'cmusaslsecretOTP'
           DESC 'OTP secret'
        EQUALITY octetStringMatch
           SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 )

   The cmusaslsecretOTP attribute is a tab separated octet string that
   contains information relevant for OTP [SASL-OTP] authentication. The
   syntax of the string is as follows:

     <alg> \t <seq> \t <seed> \t <otp> \t <timeout>

   where \t is the horizontal tab character (%x09),

    <alg> - name of the hashing algorithm as described in [SASL-OTP];

    <otp> - 16 hex digits (in lowercase) of the 8-byte OTP hash;

    <seq> - 4 digit unsigned integer that specifies how many times the user
            is allowed to log in using the password before it has to change it.
            This value is decremented each time the user has successfully authenticated;

    <seed> - random string that doesn't contain \t (<<and no NULs?>>)

    <timeout> 20 digit unsigned integer, the time since the Epoch
            (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970), measured in seconds. It defines
            the time when the record lock expires. This value is used to lock

            the record, as OTP doesn't allow for simultaneous authentication
            by the same user.

   This attribute is multivalued. For example, it may contain multiple
   OTP hashes for different hashing algorithms.


   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.3.8.1.1.4
           NAME 'cmusaslsecretSRP'
           DESC 'base64 encoded SRP secret'
        EQUALITY octetStringMatch
           SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 )

   This is the base64 encoding of the following data described in [SASL-
   SRP]:

   { utf8(mda) mpi(v) os(salt) }

   where

    mda - message digest algorithm name as defined in [SASL-SRP]

    v - password verifier (<<See: RFC 2945>>)

    salt - a random string, 1 to 255 octets in length

   This attribute is multivalued. For example, it may contain data for
   multiple message digest algorithms.


   <<cmusaslsecretPLAIN is deprecated in favor of userPassword>>


3.    Object Classes

   This document defines the following object class:

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.3.8.1.2.1
        NAME 'cmuSaslUser'
        SUP top
        AUXILIARY
        MAY ( userPassword $ cmusaslsecretCRAM-MD5 $ cmusaslsecretDIGEST-MD5 $
              cmusaslsecretOTP $ cmusaslsecretSRP) )

   The cmusaslsecretCRAM-MD5, cmusaslsecretDIGEST-MD5, cmusaslsecretOTP
   and cmusaslsecretSRP attribute types are described in section 2 of
   this document.  The userPassword attribute type is defined in
   [RFC2256].
