Internet-Draft            AS Adjacency Profile                  May 2009


1.  Introduction

   The primary purpose of the Internet IP Address and AS Number Resource
   Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) system [ID.ietf-sidr-arch] is to
   improve routing security.  As part of this security framework, a
   mechanism is defined here to allow entities to verify that an AS
   attests that is adjacent to one or more other AS's, with the
   inference that it may elect to announce routes to these adjacent AS's
   in the inter-domain routing environment.  An AAO provides this
   function.

   An AAO is a digitally signed object that makes use of Cryptographic
   Message Syntax (CMS) [RFC3852] as a standard encapsulation format.
   CMS was chosen to take advantage of existing open source software
   available for processing messages in this format.

   The AAO is an attestation authored by the local AS that the local AS
   is a routing peer to each of the AS's that are enumerated in an
   associated AS list.  An AAO is a two part structure, containing the
   local AS and a list of AS's.  The AAO is signed by a an EE Resource
   Certificate that has the local AS as the value of its AS number
   resource extension.

1.1.  Terminology

   It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the terms and concepts
   described in "Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate
   and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile" [RFC5280], "X.509
   Extensions for IP Addresses and AS Identifiers" [RFC3779], "Internet
   Protocol" [RFC0791], "Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing
   Architecture" [RFC4291], "Internet Registry IP Allocation Guidelines"
   [RFC2050], and related regional Internet registry address management
   policy documents, and BGP-4 [RFC4271]

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  Semantic Interpretation of an AAO

   An AAO is an attestation on the part of a AS holder that it supports
   inter-domain routing adjacencies to each of the AS's listed in the
   AAO.  The AAO does not list any prefixes that may be announced to the
   adjacent AS's either directly or indirectly.  The AAO also does not
   list any local routing policies that may be applied to the routes
   that are advertised across this adjacency, nor any routing policies
   that may be applied to routes that are learned from this adjacency.

Internet-Draft            AS Adjacency Profile                  May 2009


   The AAO is intended to provide "closure" with respect to
   interpretation of the AAO by relying parties, to the extent that if a
   valid AAO exists for a local AS, then from the perspective of that
   local AS all adjacencies with those AS's listed in the valid AAO can
   be regarded as "valid" and any other adjacency from the perspective
   of the local AS can be regarded as potentially "invalid".  In other
   words an AAO is an attestation of adjacency with the AS's listed in
   the AAO and an implicit attestion of the denial of adjacency with all
   other AS's.  Where an AS holder has published two or more valid
   AAO's, the set of "valid" adjacent AS's refers to the union of the
   lists of adjacent AS's and all other AS's can be regarded as
   "invalid" from the perspective of the local AS.

   It is reasonable for a relying party to infer from a valid AAO that
   the signing AS has the intent to advertise route objects across this
   adjacency, and is prepared to learn route objects that are passed to
   it from the adjacent AS.

   It is noted that an AAO is an asymmetric assertion, where one AS is
   asserting that an inter-domain routing adjacency with another AS is
   asserted to exist, but this assertion is not explicitly acknowledged
   by the remote AS in the context of a single AAO.  Relying parties may
   elect to place greater levels of confidence in the existence of an
   inter-domain routing adjacency when both AS's have signed and
   published AAO objects that contain mutual references.

   It is also noted that there is a subtle distinction that could be
   drawn here between the appropriate semantic interpretation a pair of
   unilateral assertions of adjacency using two AAOs and a bilateral
   assertion of adjacency where both AS's sign a single assertion of the
   existence of an inter-domain routing adjacency between these AS's.
   This bilateral approach, using a single assertion with two digital
   signatures, is not defined in this document.


3.  Basic Format

   Using CMS syntax, an AAO is a type of signed-data object.  The
   general format of a CMS object is:

         ContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
           contentType ContentType,
           content [0] EXPLICIT ANY DEFINED BY contentType }

         ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   As a AAO is a signed-data object, it uses the corresponding OID,
   1.2.840.113549.1.7.2.  [RFC3852]

3.1.  Signed-Data Content Type

   According to the CMS standard, the signed-data content type shall
   have ASN.1 type SignedData:

         SignedData ::= SEQUENCE {
           version CMSVersion,
           digestAlgorithms DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers,
           encapContentInfo EncapsulatedContentInfo,
           certificates [0] IMPLICIT CertificateSet OPTIONAL,
           crls [1] IMPLICIT RevocationInfoChoices OPTIONAL,
           signerInfos SignerInfos }

         DigestAlgorithmIdentifiers ::= SET OF DigestAlgorithmIdentifier

         SignerInfos ::= SET OF SignerInfo

3.1.1.  version

   The version is the syntax version number.  It MUST be 3,
   corresponding to the signerInfo structure having version number 3.

3.1.2.  digestAlgorithms

   The digestAlgorithms set MUST include only SHA-256, the OID for which
   is 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1.  [RFC4055] It MUST NOT contain any other
   algorithms.

3.1.3.  encapContentInfo

   encapContentInfo is the signed content, consisting of a content type
   identifier and the content itself.

         EncapsulatedContentInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
           eContentType ContentType,
           eContent [0] EXPLICIT OCTET STRING OPTIONAL }

         ContentType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER

3.1.3.1.  eContentType

   The ContentType for a AAO is defined as id-ct-ASAdjancyAttest and has
   the numerical value of 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.32.

Internet-Draft            AS Adjacency Profile                  May 2009


         id-smime OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840)
                                   rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs9(9) 16 }

         id-ct OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-smime 1 }

         id-ct-ASAdjacencyAttest OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ct 32 }

3.1.3.2.  eContent

   The content of an AAO identifies one or more AS's that the signing AS
   is attesting that it has a routing adjacency with.  Multiple
   adjacencies can be attested on one or more AAOs.

   The AAO contains no routing policy qualifications, nor does it
   reference any address prefixes that may be announced within the
   context of that routing adjacency.

   An AAO is formally defined as:

         id-ct-ASAdjacencyAttest ::= SEQUENCE {
           version [0] INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
           ASIdentifiers       ::= SEQUENCE OF ASIdOrRange,
           localASNum ASId}

         ASIdOrRange         ::= CHOICE {
           id                  ASId,
           range               ASRange }

         ASRange             ::= SEQUENCE {
           min                 ASId,
           max                 ASId }

         ASId                ::= INTEGER

3.1.3.2.1.  version

   The version number of the ASAdjacencyAttestation MUST be 0.

3.1.3.2.2.  ASIdentifiers

   The ASIdentifiers element is a SEQUENCE containing AS numbers for
   which the localASnum AS is attesting the existence of a routing
   adjacency.  Any pair of items in the asIdentifiers SEQUENCE MUST NOT
   overlap.  Any contiguous series of AS identifiers MUST be combined
   into a single range whenever possible.  The AS identifiers in the
   asIdentifiers element MUST be sorted by increasing numeric value.

3.1.3.2.2.1.  ASIdOrRange

   The ASIdOrRange type is a CHOICE of either a single integer (ASId) or
   a single sequence (ASRange).

3.1.3.2.2.2.  ASRange

   The ASRange type is a SEQUENCE consisting of a min and a max element,
   and is used to specify a range of AS identifier values.

3.1.3.2.2.2.1.  min and max

   The min and max elements have type ASId.  The min element is used to
   specify the value of the minimum AS identifier in the range, and the
   max element specifies the value of the maximum AS identifier in the
   range.

3.1.3.2.2.3.  ASId

   The ASId type is an INTEGER.

3.1.3.2.3.  localASNum

   The localASNum field contains the AS that is making the attestation
   of routing adjacency to each of the AS's listed in the ASIdentifiers
   element.

3.1.4.  CertificateSet

   The CertificateSet type is defined in section 10 of [RFC3852]

3.1.5.  certificates

   The certificates element MUST be included and MUST contain only the
   single end entity resource certificate needed to validate this AAO.

3.1.6.  crls

   The crls element MUST be omitted.

3.1.7.  signerInfos

   SignerInfo is defined under CMS as:

Internet-Draft            AS Adjacency Profile                  May 2009


         SignerInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
           version CMSVersion,
           sid SignerIdentifier,
           digestAlgorithm DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
           signedAttrs [0] IMPLICIT SignedAttributes OPTIONAL,
           signatureAlgorithm SignatureAlgorithmIdentifier,
           signature SignatureValue,
           unsignedAttrs [1] IMPLICIT UnsignedAttributes OPTIONAL }

3.1.7.1.  version

   The version number MUST be 3, corresponding with the choice of
   SubjectKeyIdentifier for the sid.

3.1.7.2.  sid

   The sid is defined as:

         SignerIdentifier ::= CHOICE {
           issuerAndSerialNumber IssuerAndSerialNumber,
           subjectKeyIdentifier [0] SubjectKeyIdentifier }

   For a AAO, the sid MUST be a SubjectKeyIdentifier.

3.1.7.3.  digestAlgorithm

   The digestAlgorithm MUST be SHA-256, the OID for which is
   2.16.840.1.101.3.4.2.1.  [RFC4055]

3.1.7.4.  signedAttrs

   The signedAttrs is defined as:

            SignedAttributes ::= SET SIZE (1..MAX) OF Attribute

            Attribute ::= SEQUENCE {
              attrType OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
              attrValues SET OF AttributeValue }

            AttributeValue ::= ANY

   The signedAttr element MUST be present and MUST include the content-
   type and message-digest signed attributes.  The signer MAY also
   include the signing-time signed attribute, the binary-signing-time
   signed attribute, or both signed attributes.  Other signed attributes
   that are deemed appropriate by the signer MAY also be included.  The
   intent is to allow additional signed attributes to be included if a
   future need is identified.  This does not cause an interoperability

   concern because unrecognized signed attributes are ignored by the
   relying party.

   The signedAttr MUST include only a single instance of any particular
   attribute.  Additionally, even though the syntax allows for a SET OF
   AttributeValue, in a AAO the attrValues must consist of only a single
   AttributeValue

3.1.7.4.1.  ContentType Attribute

   The ContentType attribute MUST be present.  The attrType OID for the
   ContentType attribute is 1.2.840.113549.1.9.3.

   The attrValues for the ContentType attribute in a AAO MUST be
   1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.24 (matching the eContentType in the
   EncapsulatedContentInfo).

3.1.7.4.2.  MessageDigest Attribute

   The MessageDigest attribute MUST be present.  The attrType OID for
   the MessageDigest Attribute is 1.2.840.113549.1.9.4.

   The attrValues for the MessageDigest attribute contains the output of
   the digest algorithm applied to the content being signed, as
   specified in Section 11.1 of [RFC3852].

3.1.7.4.3.  SigningTime Attribute

   The SigningTime attribute MAY be present.  If it is present it MUST
   be ignored by the relying party.  The presence of absence of the
   SigningTime attribute in no way affects the validation of the AAO (as
   specified in Section 4).  The attrType OID for the SigningTime
   attribute is 1.2.840.113549.1.9.5.

   The attrValues for the SigningTime attribute is defined as:

         SigningTime ::= Time

         Time ::= CHOICE {
              utcTime UTCTime,
              generalizedTime GeneralizedTime }

   The Time element specifies the time, based on the local system clock,
   at which the digital signature was applied to the content.

Internet-Draft            AS Adjacency Profile                  May 2009


3.1.7.4.4.  BinarySigningTimeAttribute

   The BinarySigningTime attribute MAY be present.  If it is present it
   MUST be ignored by the relying party.  The presence of absence of the
   BinarySigningTime attribute in no way affects the validation of the
   AAO (as specified in Section 3).  The attrType OID for the
   SigningTime attribute is 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.2.46.

   The attrValues for the SigningTime attribute is defined as:

         BinarySigningTime ::= BinaryTime

         BinaryTime ::= INTEGER (0..MAX)

   The BinaryTime element specifies the time, based on the local system
   clock, at which the digital signature was applied to the content.

3.1.7.5.  signatureAlgorithm

   The signatureAlgorithm MUST be RSA (rsaEncryption), the OID for which
   is 1.2.840.113549.1.1.1.

3.1.7.6.  signature

   The signature value is defined as:

         SignatureValue ::= OCTET STRING

   The signature characteristics are defined by the digest and signature
   algorithms.

3.1.7.7.  unsignedAttrs

   unsignedAttrs MUST be omitted.


4.  AAO Validation

   Before a relying party can use an AAO, the relying party must first
   use the RPKI to validate the AAO by performing the following steps.

   1.  Verify that the AAO syntax complies with this specification.  In
       particular, verify the following:

       d.  The certificates field in the SignedData object is present
           and contains an EE certificate whose Subject Key Identifier
           (SKI) matches the sid field of the SignerInfo object.

       e.  The crls field in the SignedData object is omitted.

       f.  The eContentType in the EncapsulatedContentInfo is id-ct-
           ADAdjacencyAttest (OID 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.32)

       g.  The version of the id-ct-ASAdjacencyAttest is 0.

       j.  The signatureAlgorithm in the SignerInfo object is RSA (OID
           1.2.840.113549.1.1.1).

       k.  The signedAttrs field in the SignerInfo object is present and
           contains both the ContentType attribute (OID
           1.2.840.113549.1.9.3) and the MessageDigest attribute (OID
           1.2.840.113549.1.9.4).

       l.  The unsignedAttrs field in the SignerInfo object is omitted.

   2.  Use the public key in the EE certificate to verify the signature
       on the AAO.

   3.  Verify that the EE certificate has an Autonomous System
       Identifier Delegation Extension [RFC3779] and that the Autonomous
       System Identifier in that extension exactly matches the
       Autonomous System Identifier in the localASNum element of the
       AAO.

   4.  Verify that the EE certificate is a valid end-entity certificate
       in the RPKI by constructing a valid certificate path to a trust
       anchor.  (See [ID.ietf-sidr-res-certs] for more details.)

5.  Security Considerations

   There is no assumption of confidentiality for the data in a AAO; it
   is anticipated that AAOs will be stored in repositories that are
   accessible to all ISPs, and potentially to all Internet users.  There
   is no explicit authentication associated with a AAO, since the RPKI
   that is used for AAO validation provides authorization but not
   authentication.  Although the AAO is a signed, application layer
   object, there is no intent to convey non-repudiation via a AAO.

   The purpose of a AAO is to convey a unilateral statement of intent
   that an AS has the intention to announce route objects via a routing
   adjacency with another AS and has the intention to listen for route
   objects that are passed to it over a routing adjacency.  This should
   not be interpreted as an authority, nor is a relying party justified
   in assuming that such an adjacency exists, nor that any valid routing
   announcements that are passed across this routing adjacency.

   A relying party may be able to place greater confidence in the
   inferred existence of a routing adjacency in the case where both AS
   holders mutually generate signed AAO objects that nominate each other
   as an adjacent AS.

   The AAO object does not convey any information relating to route
   policies that may be applied to the adjacency by either party to a
   route adjacency, nor what prefixes may be advertised across that
   adjacency, nor any attributes that may be associated with such
   advertisements.
