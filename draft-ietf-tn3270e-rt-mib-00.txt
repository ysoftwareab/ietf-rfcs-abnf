Abstract

  The purpose of this memo is to define the protocol and the Management
  Information Base (MIB) for performing response time data collection
  on TN3270E sessions by a TN3270E Server. The response time data
  collected by a TN3270E Server is structured to support both validation
  of service level agreements as well as performance monitoring of
  TN3270E Sessions. This MIB has as a prerequisite the TN3270E-MIB
  reference [10].

  It is the intent of this MIB to fully adhere to all prerequisite MIBs
  unless explicitly stated. Deviations will be documented in
  corresponding conformance statements. The specification of this MIB
  will utilize the Structure of Management Information (SMI) for Version
  2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol Version (refer to RFC1902,
  reference [1]).

1.  Introduction

  This document is a product of the TN3270E Working Group. Its purpose
  is to define the protocol and a MIB module for collecting Response
  Time data by a TN3270E Server. Prerequisites for implementing this MIB
  are:

         o TN3270E-MIB, Base Definitions of Managed Objects for TN3270E
                   Using SMIv2 [10].

         o TN3270E RFCs


2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

  The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of three
  major components.  They are:

  o the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1], - the mechanisms used for
    describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

  o the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [5], - the core set of managed
    objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

  o the protocol, RFC 1157 [9] and/or RFC 1905 [7] - the protocol
    for accessing managed information.

  Textual conventions are defined in RFC 1903 [6], and conformance

White, Moore      TN3270E Response Time Collection MIB      28 July 1997


  statements are defined in RFC 1904 [8].

  The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
  experimentation and evaluation.

  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI.
  A semantically identical MIB conforming to the SNMPv1 SMI can be
  produced through the appropriate translation.



2.1.  Object Definitions

  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
  the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
  defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
  defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named
  by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
  object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
  identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
  convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
  refer to the object type.




3.  Response Time Collection Methodology

  This section explains the methodology and approach used by the MIB
  defined by this memo in order to enable response time data collection
  by a TN3270E Server.



3.1.  General Response Time Collection

  Two primary methods exists for generating response times in SNA
  networks:

      o Response Time Monitoring (RTM) function
      o Timestamping using definite response flows

  This memo focuses on defining the method and resulting MIB module for
  collecting response time data by timestamping the flow between a
  client and its TN3270E Server using definite response requests and
  responses as oppose to the RTM method. The SNA Request Unit (RU) RTM
  flow was considered but was deemed unsuitable since not all TN3270E
  Server implementations have access to the underlying SNA stack to

White, Moore      TN3270E Response Time Collection MIB      28 July 1997


  access the Physical Unit (PU) in the manner that a outboard control
  unit like the IBM 3174 can when implementing RTM. The concept in the
  RTM methodology of keeping response time buckets for service level
  agreements as well as interval based response time collection for
  performance monitoring is addressed by the MIB module defined within
  this memo.

  In a SNA network the flow between a client Logical Unit (LU) and the
  target Host in general looks as follows:


        ------------------------------------------------
        |                                              |
        | Client LU             Target Host  Timestamps|
        |                                              |
        |       Transaction                            |
        | ----------------------------------->   A     |
        |                   DR                         |
        | <-----------------------------------   B     |
        |                   DR+                        |
        | ----------------------------------->   C     |
        |                                              |
        | DR: Definite Response requested              |
        | DR+: Definite Response                       |
        |                                              |
        ------------------------------------------------


  The previous flow is simplistic and is being used only as the basis to
  illustrate how timestamping the client and target host flows can be
  used to generate response times.  An IBM redbook [11] defines these
  flows and response time collection in better detail. Two components to
  response time are typically calculated:

      o Host Transit Time: Timestamp B - A
      o Network Transit Time: Timestamp C - B

  Network Transit Time is an approximation for the amount of time that a
  transaction requires to flow across a network since the definite
  response flow is used as oppose to timestamping the transaction
  network flow.  Network Transit Time, timestamp C - B, is the amount of
  time that the definite response request and its response required.
  Host Time is the actual time that the host required to process the
  transaction.  Experience has indicated that using a definite response
  flow to generate Network Transit Times is useful and does correlate to
  actual network transit times.

3.2.  TN3270E Server Response Time Collection

  A TN3270E Server connects a IP Client performing 3270 emulation to a
  Target Host over both a IP Network (IP Client to TN3270E Server) and a
  SNA Network (TN3270E Server to Target). A TN3270E Server can use the
  SNA Definite Response Request Unit (RU) flow and the TN3270
  Enhancement (RFC 1647 [11]) RESPONSES function to calculate response
  times by timestamping when a client sends a request, when the definite
  response request arrives from the target and is then acknowledged by
  the client.

  The following flow adds a TN3270E Server between the client, in this
  case a TN3270E Client and the Target Host:


        ------------------------------------------------
        |                                              |
        | Client            TN3270E             Target |
        |                    Server              Host  |
        |                   Timestamps                 |
        |                                              |
        | <---IP Network-------><---SNA Network--->    |
        |                                              |
        | Transaction (?)      D                       |
        | ---------------------------------------->    |
        |    DR Requested      E                       |
        | <----------------------------------------    |
        |    DR Response       F                       |
        | ---------------------------------------->    |
        |                                              |
        ------------------------------------------------

  A TN3270E Server can save timestamp D when it receives a client
  transaction, save timestamp E when the Target Host responds, and save
  timestamp F when the client response to a definite response request.
  It doesn't matter whether the Target Host requests the definite
  response or if the TN3270E Server makes the request on its own in
  producing timestamp F.

  In order to generate timestamp F a TN3270E Server needs to insure that
  the transaction response has DR selected and that the TN3270E
  RESPONSES function has been negotiated between the server and the
  client.  Negotiation of the TN3270E RESPONSES function is recommended
  to occur during the client's TN3270E Session initialization and not
  during transaction flow. The TN3270E Servers that the authors are
  aware of requests the RESPONSES function during client session
  initialization. TN3270E Clients either automatically support the
  RESPONSES function or can be configured to support it during startup.

White, Moore      TN3270E Response Time Collection MIB      28 July 1997


  SNA resources can be configured to automatically request definite
  response or a TN3270E Server can dynamically request it itself.  The
  tn3270eRtCollCtlType object in a tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry has a BIT
  setting, ddr(1), defined to inform the TN3270E Server as to whether
  dynamic definite response is enabled (refer to section 4.1,
  tn3270eRtCollCtlTable) for a particular response time collection
  policy.  Dynamically requesting definite response from a TN3270E
  Server does increase IP Network traffic which may not be desirable in
  certain customer environments. In addition, if a customer determines
  that their IP Network times are not significant then dynamic definite
  response (DDR) can be disabled.

  Using timestamps D, E, and F the following response times can be
  calculated by a TN3270E Server:

     o Total Response time: F - D
     o IP Network Transit Time: F - E

  The MIB defined by this memo is structured to keep response times as a
  total and as IP Network Transit Time. All of the response times being
  discussed are approximations. An underlining assumption is that the
  client can support the TN3270E RESPONSES function in order to flow a
  definite response request to a client and receive a positive reply.
  Timestamp F is set equal to timestamp E when the TN3270E Server does
  not flow a definite response request to the client. This results in a
  value of zero for IP Network Transit Time. This can occur when either
  the client doesn't support the TN3270E RESPONSES function or if DDR is
  not enabled and the TN3270E Server doesn't see DR requested in the
  transaction response.

  The SNA Network Transit Time is approximately the Total Response Time
  minus the IP Network Transit Time. When a TN3270E Server is in the
  same host as the target the SNA Network Time will approximate the Host
  Transit Time described previously. A Host (as opposed to a Gateway)
  TN3270E Server implementation can typically support the establishment
  of sessions to remote host targets in which case the SNA Network
  Transit Time contains the actual SNA Network Transit time as well as
  essentially two Host Transit Times. For this reason as well as to
  enable generation of a NOTIFICATION when a average response time was
  exceeded (refer to tn3270eRtExceeded in section 4.3) it was determined
  to represent the times kept by a TN3270E Server as a total and as IP
  Network Transit Times.


3.3.  Correlating TN3270E Server and Host Response Times

  It is possible that response time data is collected from TN3270E
  Servers at the same time as a management application is monitoring the

  session at a host. For example, a management application can be
  monitoring the Secondary Logical Unit (SLU) while retrieving data from
  a TN3270E Server. Consider the following:

        ------------------------------------------------
        |                                              |
        | Client            TN3270E             Target |
        |                    Server              Host  |
        |                   Timestamps          (PLU)  |
        |                    (SLU)           Timestamps|
        | <---IP Network-------><---SNA Network--->    |
        |                                              |
        | Transaction (?)      D                    A  |
        | ---------------------------------------->    |
        |    DR Requested      E                    B  |
        | <----------------------------------------    |
        |    DR Response       F                    C  |
        | ---------------------------------------->    |
        |                                              |
        ------------------------------------------------

  The following response times would be available:

      o Target Host Transit Time: B - A
      o Target Host Network Transit time: C - B
      o TN3270E Server Total Response Time: F - D
      o TN3270E Server IP Network Time: F - E

  The value added by the TN3270E Server in this situation is its IP
  Network Transit Time approximations. The IP Network Transit Time can
  be subtracted from the Network Transit Time determined by monitoring
  the SLU for determine actual SNA versus IP Network Transit Times.

  The MIB defined by this memo does not specifically address correlating
  or enabling collection of Response Time Data by direct SNA resource
  monitoring, but focuses on response time data collection from a
  TN3270E Server prospective. The TN3270E-RT-MIB as well as the
  TN3270E-MIB [10] have been structured to provide the needed
  information to make correlation between TN3270E Server provided
  information and direct SNA resource usage possible.

  A management application attempting to correlate SNA Resource usage to
  IP Client could monitor either the tn3270eResMapTable or the
  tn3270eTcpConnTable to determine resource to IP Address mappings.
  Both of these tables are defined by the TN3270E-MIB [10].  Neither the
  tn3270eIpGroupTable, tn3270eResPoolTable, nor the tn3270eResMapTable
  from the TN3270E-MIB can be used to determine this correlation since
  the mappings defined by these tables can overlap and may not provide

  one to one mappings.


4.  Structure of the MIB

  The TN3270E-RT-MIB has the following components:

    o tn3270eRtCollCtlTable
    o tn3270eRtDataTable
    o Notifications


4.1.  tn3270eRtCollCtlTable

  The tn3270eRtCollCtlTable is indexed by tn3270eSrvrConfIndex, imported
  from the TN3270E-MIB, and tn3270eRtCollCtlIpGroupName.
  tn3270eSrvrConfIndex identifies within a host which TN3270E Server is
  the target of the request while tn3270eRtCollCtlIpGroupName defines
  the collection of IP Clients that response time data should be
  collected for. This collection of IP Clients must be defined using the
  tn3270eIpGroupTable defined within the TN3270E-MIB.
  tn3270eIpGroupName is not used directly since it causes an
  inconsistent indexing scheme error by some MIB compilers. To avoid
  this tn3270eRtCollCtlIpGroupName was defined directly in the
  tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry.

  A tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry contains the following objects:

             ----------------------------------------------
   1st Index | tn3270eSrvrConfIndex         Unsigned32    |
   2nd Index | tn3270eRtCollCtlIpGroupName  DisplayString |
             | tn3270eRtCollCtlType         BITS          |
             | tn3270eRtCollCtlInterval     Unsigned32    |
             | tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshHigh   Unsigned32    |
             | tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshLow    Unsigned32    |
             | tn3270eRtCollCtlTranCount    Unsigned32    |
             | tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry1 Unsigned32    |
             | tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry2 Unsigned32    |
             | tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry3 Unsigned32    |
             | tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry4 Unsigned32    |
             | tn3270eRtCollCtlRowStatus    RowStatus     |
             ----------------------------------------------

  The tn3270eRtCollCtlType object controls the type of response time
  collection that occurs, the granularity of the collection, if dynamic
  definite response should be initiated, and if notifications should be
  generated. This object is of BITS SYNTAX and allows multiple option
  selection. The first option:

         o aggregate(0) - If specified indicates that data should be
                   collected for the whole IP Group. If not specified
                   then data should be collected for each IP Client
                   specified by the IP Group.

  If aggregate(0) is selected then a single entry is created in the
  tn3270eRtDataTable with the same first two indexes,
  tn3270eSrvrConfIndex and tn3270eRtCollCtlIpGroupName of the
  corresponding tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry.  A third index is added to the
  tn3270eRtDataEntry, tn3270eRtDataClientIpAddress, with a value of
  0.0.0.0.  If the aggregate(0) option is not selected then an entry is
  created in the tn3270eRtDataTable for each member of the respective IP
  Group.  tn3270eRtDataClientIpAddress would then be the actual IP
  Address of a IP Group member.

  The next two tn3270eRtCollCtlType object settings determine if dynamic
  definite response should be enabled and which type of response time
  data is to be collected:

         o ddr(1)     - Enable dynamic definite response.

         o average(2) - produce an average based on a collection
                   interval.

         o buckets(3) - increment one of the tn3270eRtDataBucket objects
                   in the corresponding tn3270eRtDataEntry based on the
                   tn3270eRtDataBucketBndry objects.

  Any of the prior settings can be selected. Either average(2) or
  buckets(3) must be selected in order for response time data collection
  to occur. If average(2) is selected then the following objects have
  meaning:

      o tn3270eRtCollCtlInterval
      o tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshHigh
      o tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshLow
      o tn3270eRtCollCtlTranCount

  If the tn3270eRtCollCtlType setting of buckets(3) is selected then the
  following objects are used to define a series of 5 counter objects in
  the associating tn3270eRtDataTable entry(s):

      o tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry1
      o tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry2
      o tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry3
      o tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry4

  When the buckets(3) option is selected the response times are

  In the IBM 3174 implementation of RTM the maximum Counter boundary
  defaults to 27 minutes 18.3 seconds. Its counters are limited to a
  value of 65,535. Both of these limitations have been removed by this
  specification. Bucket counters are unsigned 32 bit objects
  (Unsigned32). The 5th bucket, tn3270eRtDataBucket5, is defined to be
  the response times detected to be greater than the boundary specified
  by tn3270eCollCtlBucketBndry4.

  The response time data that is collected as the result of selecting
  the average option is intended primarily for performance monitoring of
  single or groups of IP Addresses and optionally monitoring of the data
  collected with NOTIFICATION generation.  Data that is collected as the
  result of the buckets(3) option can be used for either verification of
  service level agreements or be monitored via a management application
  for performance management purposes.

  The traps(4) setting for tn3270eRtCollCtlType enables generation of
  the notifications defined in section 4.3 of this memo.


4.2.  tn3270eRtDataTable

  The contents of the tn3270eRtDataTable depends on the contents of the
  tn3270eRtCollCtlTable. One or more entries in the tn3270eRtDataTable
  can be created for each tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry depending on whether the
  associating tn3270eRtCollCtlType has aggregate(0) selected as
  described in the previous section.  Selection of the
  tn3270eRtCollCtlType option average(2) results in the following
  objects being maintained:

       o tn3270eRtDataCurrElapsIpRtSq

  There are basically two sets of similar objects in the prior list.
  One set of data pertains to the last collection interval timestamped
  by tn3270eRtDaraIntTimeStamp. The second set of objects are running
  totals of the response time data and transaction counts.  The
  following objects (sum of the squares values) are kept in order to
  enable variance calculations by a management application:

       o tn3270eRtDataCurrElapsRndTrpSq
       o tn3270eRtDataCurrElapsIpRtSq

  Selection of the tn3270eRtCollCtlType option buckets(2) results in the
  following objects being maintained:

       o tn3270eRtDataBucket1
       o tn3270eRtDataBucket2
       o tn3270eRtDataBucket3
       o tn3270eRtDataBucket4
       o tn3270eRtDataBucket5

  A discontinuity object, tn3270eRtDataDiscontinuityTime, can be used by
  a management application to detect when the values of objects in this
  table may of been reset due to a TN3270E Server being stopped or
  restarted.

  When tn3270eRtCollCtlType has a setting of aggregate(0) an entry
  should automatically be created in the tn3270eRtDataTable where
  tn3270eRtDataClientIpAddress has a value of 0.0.0.0.  Entries in the
  tn3270eRtDataTable should automatically be created for each member of
  a IP Group when aggregate(0) is not selected when either a IP Client
  connects to the TN3270E Server or when the TN3270E Server determines
  that a IP Client is in a IP Group specified by a
  tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry.  All corresponding tn3270eRtDataTable entries
  should be deleted when its tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry is deleted. When
  performing data collection on a single IP Group member delete its
  tn3270eRtDataEntry when its TCP Connection terminates.

4.3.  Notifications

  All notifications require that the associating tn3270eRtCollCtlType
  contain a setting of traps. The following notifications are defined by
  this MIB specification:

         o tn3270eRtExceeded - If 'average' response time data is being
                   collected then this notification is generated when an
                   average response time, tn3270eRtDataAverageRt, is
                   first detected that exceed a high threshold as
                   defined in the associating tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry on a
                   collection interval boundary. In addition, the number
                   of transactions used to calculate the average,
                   tn3270eRtDataTransCount, must be greater than or
                   equal to the corresponding tn3270eRtCollCtlTranCount.
                   This notification is not regenerated until a
                   tn3270eRtOkay notification occurs for the respective
                   tn3270eRtDataEntry. The purpose of this notification
                   is to signal that a performance problem has been
                   detected.

         o tn3270eRtOkay - If 'average' response time data is being
                   collected then this notification is generated when a
                   average response time, tn3270eRtDataAverageRt, for a
                   collection interval is detected to be below the low
                   threshold as defined in the associating
                   tn3270eRtCollEntry after a tn3270eRtExceeded
                   notification was first generated. The purpose of this
                   notification is to signal that the previously
                   reported performance problem was resolved.  The
                   purpose of a low threshold,
                   tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshLow, for use in generation of
                   this notification is to enable definition of a small
                   window to prevent spurious trap generation. The
                   intent is that tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshLow will be set
                   to a value close to that of
                   tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshHigh.


         o tn3270eRtCollStart - This notification is generated whenever
                   data collection begins or when a tn3270eRtDataEntry
                   becomes active.  The primary purpose of this
                   notification is to provide the IP to Resource mapping
                   for a particular session to a management application.
                   This notification is not critical when average data
                   collection is not being performed.

         o tn3270eRtCollEnd - This notification is generated whenever a

                   data collection ends. This occurs when the
                   corresponding tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry is deleted for
                   either aggregate or individual collections or when
                   the IP Client connection terminates for individual
                   collections. This enables a management application to
                   complete an monitoring function that it is
                   performancing since it is unlikely that a collection
                   would end exactly after a tn3270eRtDataTable poll
                   occurred.

6.  Security Considerations

  Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered
  sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore, authentication of
  received SNMP requests and controlled access to management information
  should be employed in such environments.  The method for this
  authentication is a function of the SNMP Administrative Framework, and
  has not been expanded by this MIB.

  Several objects in this MIB allow write access or provide for remote
  creation. Allowing this support in a non-secure environment can have a
  negative effect on network operations.  It is recommended that
  implementers seriously consider whether set operations should be
  allowed without providing, at a minimum, authentication of request
  origin. It it recommended that without such support that the following
  objects be implemented as read-only:

      o tn3270eRtCollCtlType
      o tn3270eRtCollCtlInterval
      o tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshHigh
      o tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshLow
      o tn3270eRtCollCtlTranCount
      o tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry1
      o tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry2
      o tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry3
      o tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry4

  The following object should either be implemented as read-only or not
  implemented when security is an issue as previously discussed:

      o tn3270eRtCollCtlRowStatus

  The administrative method to use to create and manage the
  tn3270eRtCollCtlTable when SET support is not allowed is outside of
  the scope of this memo.
