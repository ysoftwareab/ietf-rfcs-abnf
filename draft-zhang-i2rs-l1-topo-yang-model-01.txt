Abstract 

   This draft describes a YANG data model to manipulate the topologies 
   of a layer 1 network. It is independent of data plan technologies 
   and control plane protocols. It can be augmented to include 
   technology-specific data, such as for Optical Transport Networks 
   (OTN).

1. Introduction 

   This document defines a data model of a layer one network topology, 
   using YANG [RFC6020]. The model can be used by an application via 
   the I2RS interface [draft-ietf-i2rs-architecture], in the following 
   ways (but not limited to):  

     o to obtain a whole view of the network topology information of 
   its interest;  

      o to receive notifications with regard to the information of the 
   change of the network topology of its interest;

draft-zhang-i2rs-l1-topo-yang-model-01.txt                   March 2015 
    

      o to enforce the establishment/update of a network topology with 
   the characteristic specified in the data model; 

   This model is confined to describe layer 1 networks, but it is data 
   plane technology independent and can be augmented to specify the 
   topology for networks such as Optical Transport networks (OTN), 
   Synchronous Digital Network/ (SDH/SONET)  DWDM (Dense Wavelength 
   Division Multiplexing).  

   [Editor's Note: The authors are aware that there are other drafts 
   closely relating to this draft. Coordination works have been 
   undergoing to get these drafts aligned. The authors are working on 
   obtaining layer one topology by augmenting the data model proposed 
   in draft-clemm-i2rs-yang-network-topo in the next version of this 
   draft.]  

2. Conventions used in this document 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. Terminology and Notations 

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in 
   this document. The meaning of the symbols in the YANG data tree 
   presented later in this draft is defined in [ietf-netmod-rfc6087bis]. 
   They are provided below for reference. 

     o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys. 

      o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration      
   (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only). 

      o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"      
   means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list. 

      o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are 
   also marked with a colon (":"). 

      o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not      
   shown.

4.1.1. The node and link list 
   The Layer One Topology module contains all the nodes and links 
   information pertaining to a layer one network. The node is 
   identified by the node-id, which is unique within the network. 
   Within the nodes, all the interfaces pertaining to this node and 
   their potential capabilities/constraints SHOULD be present. Besides 
   this, the constraints associated with a node as a whole SHOULD also 
   be present, such as the connectivity constraints introduced due to 
   abstraction or due to the hardware limitations. The link is 
   identified by the link-id, which is unique within a node. It 
   includes the association with nodes as well as interfaces. Moreover, 
   it includes information that is of interest to the I2RS client, for 
   purposes, such as path computation, monitoring etc. 

4.1.2. Notification 

   Two types of notifications are introduced: node failure and link 
   failure.

5. Security Considerations 

   Since the data model defined in this draft is manipulated vis the 
   I2RS interface. The security concerns mentioned in [draft-ietf-i2rs-
   architecture] also applies to this draft. 
    
   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via   
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the   
   secure transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure   
   transport is SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model   
   [RFC6536] provides the means to restrict access for particular   
   NETCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF   
   protocol operations and content. 
    
   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which 
   are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the   
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or ulnerable   
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>)   
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative   
   effect on network operations. 
    
   [Editor's note: to List specific subtrees and data nodes and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability.] 
    
6. Manageability Considerations  

   TBD. 
    
7. IANA Considerations 

   TBD.  
    
8. Acknowledgements 

   The initial YANG model specified in this draft is based on draft-
   clemm-i2rs-yang-network-topo but it is modified according to the 
   features of the layer one networks. 
    
   We would like to thank the authors of the above mentioned draft for 
   their helpful discussion during the creation of this draft.
