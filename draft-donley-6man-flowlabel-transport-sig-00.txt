              Using the Flow Label for Transport Signaling
              draft-donley-6man-flowlabel-transport-sig-00

Abstract

   This document extends the use of the IPv6 Flow Label to include
   transport header and port information.  The inclusion of these
   details allows for the application of Quality of Service (QoS)
   classification and prioritization, and permits hardware acceleration
   of IP traffic flows encapsulated within other protocols such as Dual-
   Stack Lite, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) and Layer 2 Tunneling
   Protocol version 3 (L2TPv3).

1.  Introduction

   As described in [RFC2460], the IP version 6 (IPv6) Main Header may
   include IPv6 Extension Headers in any order between the IPv6 Main
   Header and the upper layer protocol header.  This poses a problem for
   some routers, many deep packet inspection (DPI) appliances, and most
   residential/small office devices such as home gateways.  These
   devices may have difficulty identifying the upper layer transport
   protocol and/or port number for special handling of the packet in
   hardware.

   By providing a pointer to expose the transport header and port number
   directly within the Main Header, an implementer may more easily
   support hardware-assisted packet forwarding and prioritization of
   flows based on transport information.  For example, during the
   transition from IPv4 to IPv6, it is likely that IP traffic will be
   encapsulated inside of IPv6 at a home gateway, thereby inserting an
   additional Extension Header and further obscuring transport protocol
   information from the forwarding engine.  The QoS advantage is
   compounded as additional Extension Headers are added, such as an
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) header for IPSEC VPNs.  The IPv6
   main header's Flow Label field and its relation to the other fields
   in the IPv6 header are detailed in Figure 1.

   As described in [RFC3697], a flow is a sequence of packets sent from
   a particular source to a particular unicast, anycast, or multicast
   destination that the source desires to label as a flow.  Packet
   classifiers can use the triplet of Flow Label, Source Address, and
   Destination Address fields to identify packets belonging to a
   particular flow.  [RFC3697] assumes that Flow Labels uniquely
   identify a flow and that they do not contain mathematical or other
   properties; however, as allowed by [I-D.carpenter-6man-flow-update],
   if protocol and port information are included in the Flow Label,
   routers can use the Flow Label for hardware-accelerated forwarding
   and packet classification.

3.  Using the IPv6 Flow Label for Transport Signaling

   The IPv6 Main Header contains a Next Header field that points to the
   Extended Header following the Main Header, as shown in Figure 1.
   Each Extended Header that may be present contains its own Next Header
   field, providing a chain to each Extended Header until the last
   Extended Header in the sequence is populated with a Next Header value
   of "no next header".

   The IPv6 Main Header also contains a Flow Label field that is
   intended to be used for QoS classification.  To enhance Flow Label
   based classification, encapsulating routers MUST set the most
   significant bit to 1 to indicate [I-D.carpenter-6man-flow-update]
   behavior, and SHOULD include the 8-bit IANA-assigned protocol number
   and the low order 10 bits of the IANA-assigned port number (if
   applicable) of the unencapsulated IP packet in the Flow Label field
   of the encapsulating IPv6 header, as shown in Figure 2.  Such routers
   SHOULD set the P bit to 0 to indicate that the port number is the
   destination port or 1 to indicate that the port number is the source
   port.

   Whenever the Next Header field in the IPv6 Main Header does not
   contain the transport header information (e.g.  TCP, UDP), as would
   be the case when IP in IP encapsulation is configured, the Flow Label
   will expose the transport protocol and port information directly
   within the IPv6 Main Header, allowing classification on any router
   implementing Flow Label handling while providing performance
   enhancement on most commodity-based routers.

   Routers along the transmission path can classify traffic based on the
   Flow Label either in its entirety or by using a wildcard mask to
   consider only certain bits such as the representation of the
   transport protocol or port number.

   [I-D.carpenter-6man-flow-update], rather than [RFC3697] behavior.

   Port

   Port Number - the lower 10 bits of the 16-bit IANA-defined port
   number [IANAPort] (e.g. the modulo(1024) representation of the port
   number).  If the P bit is set to 0, the port number MUST be set to
   the segment's destination port.  If the P bit is set to 1, the port
   number MUST be set to the segment's source port.  If the transport
   protocol does not use ports, these bits MAY be set to a pseudo-random
   sequence, as described in [RFC3697].

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are described in [RFC3697], section 5.  The
   flow label is not protected, and could be modified by an on-path
   attacker.  However, the impact of any such modification would be
   limited to the QoS treatment of the modified packet(s).
