Internet-Draft    SIEVE Email Filtering: MIME Extension    February 2004


1. Introduction and Overview

   The SIEVE Email Filtering [RFC3028] specification currently does not
   provide a way to test the values of MIME [RFC2045] part headers
   within a message. Currently, all that can be done is a standard
   "header" test against the top-level message headers (and thus the
   top-level MIME part of the message). However, it is handy to be able
   to check for values in any MIME part headers, or check for the
   presence of specific MIME types etc. This extension introduces a new
   "mime" test that allows the values of every MIME part header to be
   tested.

2. Conventions Used in This Document

   Conventions for notations are as in [RFC3028] section 1.1, including
   use of [RFC2119].

3. SIEVE MIME Extension

3.1 General Considerations

   SIEVE implementations that implement the "mime" test have an
   identifier of "mime" for use with the capability mechanism. If the
   "mime" test is used in a SIEVE script, the corresponding capability
   item MUST appear in the script's "require" statement. Like the
   "header" test in [RFC3028], folding of long header lines (as
   described in [RFC2822]) is removed prior to interpretation of the
   data.

3.2 Test "mime"

           Syntax:   mime [COMPARATOR] [MATCH-TYPE]
                     <header-names: string-list>
                     [<parameter-names: string-list>]
                     <key-list: string-list>

   The "mime" test evaluates to true if any MIME header name, or any
   parameter within a MIME header name, matches any key. The type of
   match is specified by the optional match argument, which defaults to
   ":is" if not provided, as specified in section 2.6 of [RFC3028].

   If no parameter-names argument is present, then the entire content of
   the headers specified in the header-names argument is evaluated. So
   if a message contained the MIME header:

       Content-Type: image/jpeg; filename="example.jpg"

   these tests on that MIME header evaluate as follows:

       mime :contains ["Content-Type"] ["image"]    => true
       mime :contains ["Content-Type"] ["jpg"]      => true
       mime :contains ["Content-Type"] ["filename"] => true
       mime :contains ["Content-Type"] ["gif"]      => false

   If the parameter-names argument is present, then only the content of
   matching MIME parameters in the specified headers are evaluated. So
   if a message contained the MIME header:

       Content-Type: image/jpeg; filename="example.jpg"

   these tests on that MIME header evaluate as follows:

       mime :contains ["Content-Type"] ["filename"] ["image"]    => false
       mime :contains ["Content-Type"] ["filename"] ["jpg"]      => true
       mime :contains ["Content-Type"] ["filename"] ["filename"] => false
       mime :contains ["Content-Type"] ["filename"] ["gif"]      => false
       mime :contains ["Content-Type"] ["name"] ["jpg"]          => false

   If the parameter-names argument is present, but contains a single
   empty string, then the content of specified MIME header, excluding
   any parameters, will be evaluated. So if a message contained the MIME
   header:

       Content-Type: image/jpeg; filename="example.jpg"

   these tests on that MIME header evaluate as follows:

       mime :contains ["Content-Type"] [""] ["image"]    => true
       mime :contains ["Content-Type"] [""] ["jpg"]      => false
       mime :contains ["Content-Type"] [""] ["filename"] => false
       mime :contains ["Content-Type"] [""] ["gif"]      => false

   Like the "header" test in [RFC3028], this test returns true if any
   combination of the header-names, parameters-names and key-list
   arguments match.

   Like the "header" test in [RFC3028], if a MIME header listed in the
   header-names argument exists, it contains the null key (""). However,
   if the named header is not present, it does not contain the null key.
   So if a message contained the MIME header:

       Content-Caffeine: C8H10N4O2

   these tests on that header evaluate as follows:

       mime :is ["Content-Caffeine"] [""]       => false
       mime :contains ["Content-Caffeine"] [""] => true

Internet-Draft    SIEVE Email Filtering: MIME Extension    February 2004


   A similar behaviour applies to MIME parameters specified by the
   parameter-names argument:

       Content-Caffeine: C8H10N4O2; param1=example

   these tests on that parameter evaluate as follows:

      mime :is ["Content-Caffeine"] ["param1"] [""]       => false
      mime :contains ["Content-Caffeine"] ["param1"] [""] => true


4. Security Considerations

   The "mime" extension does not raise any security considerations that
   are not present in the base [RFC3028] protocol, and these issues are
   discussed in [RFC3028].

5. IANA Considerations

   The following template specifies the IANA registration of the Sieve
   extension specified in this document:

5.1 mime registration

       To: iana@iana.org
       Subject: Registration of new Sieve extension

       Capability name: mime
       Capability keyword: mime
       Capability arguments:
                     mime [COMPARATOR] [MATCH-TYPE]
                     <header-names: string-list>
                     [<parameter-names: string-list>]
                     <key-list: string-list>
