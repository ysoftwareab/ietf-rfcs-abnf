1  Introduction

   With the rapid development of Internet technology and the increasing
   complexity of broadband network architecture, it is quite difficult
   to do large scale network measurements due to the lack of the unified
   measurement system and cooperative protocols. Therefore, the Large-
   Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) working group is
   formed to standardize a large scale measurement system for
   performance measurements of all kinds of broadband access methods. 

   There are 3 types of entities proposed in the LMAP architecture: [I-
   D.ietf-lmap-framework]

   o  Measurement Agents (MAs), implemented in network to perform
   measurement tasks; 

   o  Controller, responsible for creating and assigning the measurement
   tasks; and 

   o  Collector, in charge of collecting and storing measurement
   results.

   This document presents REST-style protocols for LMAP based on the
   information model from [I-D.ietf-lmap-information-model]. 

2  Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document follows the standardized HTTP/1.1 [RFC2616] and JSON
   [RFC4627] specifications.

   REST: Representational State Transfer

   The following terms used in this document are defined in [I-D.ietf-
   lmap-framework].

   o Bootstrap

   o Channel

   o Collector

   o Controller

   o Control Channel

   o Control Protocol

   o Data Model

   o Instruction

   o Measurement Agent (MA)

   o Measurement Peer (MP)

   o Measurement Schedule

   o Measurement Task

   o Measurement Traffic

   o Report

   o Report Channel

   o Report Protocol

   o Report Schedule

   o Subscriber

3 Control Protocol

   The control protocol is used between controller and the measurement
   agent.

3.1 Configuration Update from Controller to MA

   Configuration allows the Controller to update the MA about some or
   all of the information that it obtained during the bootstrapping
   process: the MA-ID, the (optional) Group-ID and the Control Channel.
   The configuration update REST-style protocol is defined to convey the
   configuration information from the Controller to the MA, via a HTTP
   PUT, as described below.

   PUT  /ma/config/   Update the configuration from controller to MA

   3.1.1 Request parameters


   The following are JSON parameters for the configuration update.

   The Instruction is the description of the Measurement Tasks for a
   Measurement Agent to do and the details of the Measurement Reports
   for it to send, which is realized by a HTTP POST transaction.

   POST /ma/ins/   Send measurement instruction from controller to MA

   o ma-tasks: the list of measurement tasks contained in the

   parameters:
     o ma-task-name: the string name for a specific measurement task, to
   be used as reference in other places, such as measurement schedules
   and suppressions.
     o ma-task-registry: the URN (Uniform Resource Name) of the
   measurement task as defined by [I-D.draft-ippm-registry].
     o ma-task-options: the list of input parameters that are to be used
   when performing the measurement task, which are specific to each
   measurement task in question and defined by [I-D.draft-ippm-

     o ma-task-cycle-id(optional): the identification ID for a group of
   measurement tasks with comparable options, which is manually
   incremented when an Option change is implemented which could mean
   that two sets of results should not be directly compared.

   where each measurement schedule contains the following parameters:
     o ma-schedule-name: the string name for a specific measurement
   schedule, to be used as reference in other places, such as
   suppressions.

   for this schedule, where each scheduled measurement task contains the
   following parameter in addition to its name, options and cycle-id:

   measurement reporting, which in turn contains an optional filter
   configuration for a specified group (default is all) of measurement
   output to a named report channel.

   schedules to configure the measurement reporting for the instruction,
   which is also used to define the control channel by configuration
   request from Controller to the MA.

     o ma-channel-target: the URL of the Controller to be contacted by
   the MA.

   Controller communications, whose value can be one of the following
   parameters:
         o ma-timing-periodic: the periodic timing arrangement for the
   Controller communications, which in turn includes the following
   parameters:
           o ma-periodic-start(optional): the time of the day (in
   miliseconds) when the communication starts. If absent, the period
   starts immediately.
           o ma-periodic-end(optional): the time of day (in miliseconds)
   when the communication ends. If absent, the communication is not
   stopped unless the MA is otherwise instructed.
           o ma-periodic-interval: the interval time (in miliseconds) of
   periodic communications.
          o ma-timing-calendar: the communication happens according to a
   calendar-like timing arrangements.
         o ma-timing-one-off: the communication happens once and for
   all.
         o ma-timing-immediate: the communication happens immediately.
       o ma-timing-randomness: the randomness configuration to be added

   onto each communication event.
     o ma-channel-interface-name: the name of MA's interface to be used
   when contacting the Controller.
     o ma-channel-connect-always: the indicator whether or not to keep
   the connection to the Controller. If absent, the connection is
   reopened whenever new communication is pending and closed when it is
   over.
   o ma-suppression: the measurement tasks/schedules to be suppressed by
   the instruction. In addition to the lists of measurement
   tasks/schedules, it also contains the following parameters:
     o ma-suppression-enabled(optional): The bool indicator of whether
   or not to enable the local suppression by the MA. For example, a
   later unsuppression to an earlier suppression instruction can be
   achieved by setting this indicator to 'false'.  Default is false. 
     o ma-suppression-start(optional): The time when to start the
   suppression action. Default is immediate.
     o ma-suppression-end(optional): The time when to end the
   suppression action. Default is infinite.

5  Security Considerations

   The REST API could be protected by several ways. One common solution
   is to provide authentication mechanism for all the HTTP request.
   Encryption mechanism could also be provided by HTTPS.


6  IANA Considerations

   There is no IANA action in this document.
