1.  Introduction

   5G services are starting to be introduced in real operational
   networks.  The challenges of 5G are multiple, impacting in different
   technological areas such as radio access, mobile core and transport
   network.  From all those technological areas, the transport network
   is the focus of this document.

   It is important for operators to have a good basis of benchmarking
   solutions, technologies and architectures before moving them into
   production.  With such aim, this document intends to overview
   available guidelines to assist on the benchmarking of 5G transport
   networks, identifying gaps that could require further work and
   details.

   As result, it is expected to provide guidance on benchmarking of 5G
   transport network infrastructures ready for experimentation in lab
   environments or real deployment in operational networks.

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119].

3.  5G services

   5G transport networks will need to accommodate different kind of
   services with very distinct needs and requirements leveraging on the
   same infrastructure. 5G services can be grouped in three main

   categories, namely enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), ultra-Reliable
   and Low Latency Communications (URLLC), and massive Machine Type
   Communications (mMTC).  Each of them presents different inherent
   characteristics spanning from ultra-low latency to high bandwidth and
   high reliability.  For instance, eMMB services are expected to
   provide peak bit rates of up to 1 Gbps, uRRLC services will require
   latencies as lower as below microsecond delays, and mMTC will demand
   to support up to 100 times the number of current sessions.  All these
   features impose great constraints to the networks deployed today in
   backhaul and aggregation, in terms of not only network capacity but
   also in terms of data processing, especially for guaranteeing very
   low latencies.

   The impact in the transport network of those challenges is increased
   by some other additional challenges introduced by the emergence of
   two new technological paradigms: the network virtualization and the
   network programmability.

   In one hand, virtualization will introduce uncertainty on the traffic
   patterns due to the flexibility and scalability in the deployment
   traffic sources in the transport network.  On the other hand,
   programmability will potentially enable automated reconfiguration of
   the transport network which requires coordination mechanisms to avoid
   misconfigurations.

   A final consideration is the introduction of the network slicing
   concept in 5G networks.  According to that, the objective is to
   provide customized and tailored logical networks to different
   customers, allocating resources for the specific customer service
   request.

4.  Benchmarking aspects of transport networks in 5G

   The benchmarking aspects of 5G transport networks can be then
   structured in the following manner:

   Data plane benchmarking:  aspects to consider in data plane
      benchmarking refer to both hardware capabilities as well as to
      transport encapsulations.  Examples of hardware capabilities are
      recent developments such as IEEE TSN, and example of encapsulation
      is SRv6 [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming].

   Control plane benchmarking:  aspects to consider for control plane
      relates to transport infrastructure programmability.  In this case
      some previous works exists such as RFC8456 [RFC8456].

   Management plane benchmarking:  one specific aspect of management
      benchmarking in 5G refers to the capability of managing the
      transport network slice lifecycle.

   Architecture benchmarking:  new architectural frameworks are being
      conceived to support advanced services like 5G.  An example of
      these architectures is [I-D.ietf-detnet-architecture].
