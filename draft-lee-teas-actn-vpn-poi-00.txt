                       draft-lee-teas-actn-vpn-poi-00
Abstract

     This document outlines the applicability of Abstraction and
     Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) to VPN with the
     integration of Packet and Optical Networks (POI). It also
     identifies a number of scenarios where the integration of packet
     and optical networks is necessary to support VPN service
     requirements. The role of optical underlay tunnels in the POI is
     to support certain applications that require a hard isolation with
     strict deterministic latency and guaranteed constant bandwidth.

1. Introduction

     Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN)
     describes a set of management and control functions used to
     operate one or more TE networks to construct virtual networks that
     can be represented to customers and that are built from
     abstractions of the underlying TE networks so that, for example, a
     link in the customer's network is constructed from a path or
     collection of paths in the underlying networks [RFC8453].

     This document outlines the applicability of ACTN to VPN with the
     integration of packet and optical networks which is known as the
     Packet and Optical Integration (POI).

     It also identifies a number of scenarios where the integration of
     packet and optical networks is necessary to support VPN service
     requirements. The role of optical underlay tunnels in the POI is
     to support certain applications that require a hard isolation with
     strict deterministic latency and guaranteed constant bandwidth.

     Note that there may be other transport technologies that can
     support the aforementioned service requirements such as TSN or
     Detnet to name a few. In this particular document, we are focusing
     on the currently available network settings where packet networks
     are a client layer to optical transport networks as a server
     layer. The principle discussed in this document can be applied to
     other transport technologies when they are available.

     As ACTN [RFC8453] introduces the role of controllers that
     facilitate network operations, the scope of this document is how
     controllers can facilitate L2/3VPN service provisioning in the
     packet and optical transport networks.

1.1. Requirements Language

     The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
     NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
     "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
     described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
     appear in all capitals, as shown here.

2. Background and Scope

     One of the important functions the MDSC performs is to identify
     which TE Tunnels should carry the L3VPN traffic and to relay this
     information to the domain-level controllers to ensure proper
     Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) table be populated according
     to the TE binding requirement for the L3VPN. This function is
     referred to as TE & service mapping function. The YANG model to
     provide TE & service mapping function is provided in [TSM]. The
     role of the TE-service Mapping model [TSM] is to expose the
     mapping relationship between service models and TE models so that
     VN/VPN service instantiations provided by the underlying TE
     networks can be viewed outside of the MDSC.

     The TE-Service Mapping model also provides service-TE binding
     information for each service instance so that proper TE tunnel
     should be created.

     The TE binding requirement types defined in [TSM] are:

        a) New VN/Tunnel Binding - A customer could request a VPN
          service based on VN/Tunnels that are not shared with other
          existing or future services. This might be to meet VPN
          isolation requirements.

          Under this mode, the following sub-categories can be
          supported:

           i.  Hard Isolation with deterministic characteristics: A
               customer could request a VPN service using a set of TE
               Tunnels with deterministic characteristics requirements
               (e.g., no latency variation) and where that set of TE
               Tunnels must not be shared with other VPN services and
               must not compete for bandwidth or other network
               resources with other TE Tunnels.

          ii.  Hard Isolation: This is similar to the above case but
               without the deterministic characteristics requirements.

         iii.  Soft Isolation: The customer requests a VPN service
               using a set of TE tunnels which can be shared with other
               VPN services.

        b) VN/Tunnel Sharing - A customer could request a VPN service
          where new tunnels (or a VN) do not need to be created for
          each VPN and can be shared across multiple VPNs.

        c) VN/Tunnel Modify - This mode allows the modification of the
          properties of the existing VN/tunnel (e.g., bandwidth).

     This document addresses cases a)-i (hard isolation with
     deterministic latency) and a)-ii (hard isolation with non-
     deterministic latency). Both cases warrant consideration of
     optical undelay bypass tunnels to meet the service requirement.

     The optical bypass tunnel could be setup via RSVP-TE signaling and
     thus tunnel label allocation could be done during signaling. It is
     also possible that PNC and MDSC coordinates to exchange the TE
     tunnel label information to setup this optical bypass tunnel. This
     document focuses on the latter case.

     The multi-hop e-BGP session between ingress and egress for multi-
     domain case would be setup to exchange VPN routes. The rest of the
     forwarding action is as per the usual BGP L3VPN handling including
     the use of TE tunnel.


3. POI with L2/L3VPN Service Under Single Network Operator Control

     This section provides a set of specific deployment scenarios for
     POI under single network operator control. Specifically, the
     following deployment scenarios are discussed in this section:

     - One optical transport domain overarched by one packet domain
       (see Section 3.1);
     - One optical transport domain overarched by multiple packet
       domains (see Section 3.2);
     - multiple optical transport domains overarched by multiple packet
       domains (see Section 3.3).

     All scenarios are taking place in the context of an upper layer
     service configuration (e.g., L3VPN) in the packet and optical
     transport network.

     Since this document only addresses the procedure for creating
     optical underlay bypass tunnels, it does not affect MP-BGP MPLS
     operations for inter-AS scenarios as specified in [RFC4364].


3.1. POI with single packet and single optical domain

     This section provides a specific deployment scenario for POI.
     Specifically, it provides a deployment scenario in which
     hierarchical controllers (an MDSC and two PNCs, one for packet and

     one for optical) facilitate optical bypass tunnel across the
     packet domain and the optical domain.

     Figure 1 shows this scenario.

   Figure 1. One Packet Domain and One Optical Domain

     The following control sequence describes the scenario depicted in
     Figure 1.

       a) The MDSC translates the service instance and its requirement
          (hard isolation with deterministic latency).
       b) The MDSC computes the path if there is any feasible path to
          meet the requirement based on the abstracted topology at
          hand. Note that there would not be any tunnel in the packet
          domain to meet this requirement (hard isolation with
          deterministic latency).
       c) The MDSC finds a feasible path in the optical domain.
       d) The MDSC asks the optical PNC to create a tunnel for this VPN
          instance whose endpoints are the ingress PE and the egress PE

Internet-Draft    ACTN Applicability to VPN with POI       October 2018

          of the packet domain, respectively. The MDSC and Optical PNC
          need to maintain an instance ID for this VPN instance.
       e) The MDSC asks the Packet PNC to bind a TE-tunnel label (to be
          allocated by the egress PE to identify the underlay optical
          tunnel) with the VPN ID and the Ingress and Egress interfaces
          of the underlay optical tunnel.
       f) The PNC in turn asks the Egress PE to allocate a TE-tunnel
          label. The Egress PE allocates a TE-tunnel label, populates
          the VRF for this VPN instance, and updates the Packet PNC
          with the allocated TE-tunnel label. Please refer to the note
          below on the details of this procedure in regard to VPN
          binding.

          Note: There are two cases for binding network instance with
          the TE tunnel label:

            1. VRF instance does not exist.
            2. VRF instance has already been created.

          For case 1, the Egress PE needs to bind the TE-tunnel label
          and the VPN information (e.g., VPN instance name, VPN label,
          RD, RT, Destination IP address, etc.) and inform this binding
          information to the packet PNC.

       g) The packet PNC informs the MDSC the allocated TE-tunnel label
          for the VPN instance.
       h) The MDSC informs the optical PNC to bind the TE-tunnel label
          with the VPN instance, which has been created previously in
          step d).
       i) The optical PNC informs this binding information (i.e.,
          ingress/egress interfaces from packet domain and the TE-
          tunnel label) to the optical ingress switch.
       j) The packet PNC informs the ingress PE to use the TE-label for
          this VPN instance. The Ingress PE populates the VRF for the
          VPN with the TE-label. (Note that the TE-label would need to
          be PUSHed over the VPN traffic).
       k) When the packet arrives at the ingress PE, it recognizes the
          VPN instance and PUSHes the VPN label and the TE-tunnel label
          and forward the traffic to optical ingress switch.
       l) The optical ingress switch recognizes the TE-tunnel label and
          encapsulate the whole data packet including TE-tunnel label
          into the OTN payload.
       m) The optical egress switch POPs the ODU label and forwards the
          data packet to the packet egress PE.
       n) The packet egress PE POPs the TE-tunnel label and forwards
          the VPN packets to the destination CE.

Internet-Draft    ACTN Applicability to VPN with POI       October 2018

     Note: in steps k) - l), the assumption made was that the packet
     ingress PE is not OTN-capable router. If the packet ingress PE
     support channelized OTN interfaces, the data plane behavior in
     steps k) and l) would change as the following:

          k') When the packets arrives at the ingress PE, it recognizes
          the VPN instance and PUSHes the VPN label and the TE-tunnel
          label and the ODU label and forward the traffic to optical
          ingress switch.

          l') The optical ingress switch recognizes the incoming ODU
          label and swap it to outgoing ODU label.

3.2. POI with multiple packet domains and single optical domain

     This section provides a specific deployment scenario for POI.
     Specifically, it provides a deployment scenario in which
     hierarchical controllers (an MDSC and two packet PNCs and one
     optical PNC) facilitate optical bypass tunnel across the two
     packet domains and the optical domain.

     Figure 2 shows this scenario.

   Figure 2. Two Packet Domains and One Optical Domain

     The control sequence depicted in Figure 2 is same as the control
     sequence a)-d) in Section 3.1 with the following differences:

       e) The MDSC asks the Packet PNC 2 to bind a TE-tunnel label (to
          be allocated by the egress PE to identify the underlay
          optical tunnel) with the VPN ID and the Ingress and Egress
          interfaces of the underlay optical tunnel.
       f) The packet PNC 2 in turn asks the Egress PE to allocate a TE-
          tunnel label. The Egress PE allocates a TE-tunnel label,
          populates the VRF for this VPN instance, and updates the
          packet PNC 2 with the allocated TE-tunnel label. Please refer
          to the note below on the details of this procedure in regard
          to VPN binding.

          Note: There are two cases for binding network instance with
          the TE tunnel label:

            1. VRF instance does not exist.
            2. VRF instance has already been created.

          For case 1, the Egress PE needs to bind the TE-tunnel label
          and the VPN information (e.g., VPN instance name, VPN label,
          RD, RT, Destination IP address, etc.) and inform this binding
          information to the packet PNC 2.

       g) The packet PNC 2 informs the MDSC the allocated TE-tunnel
          label for the VPN instance.
       h) The MDSC informs the packet PNC 1 the allocated TE-tunnel
          label for the VPN instance.
       i) The MDSC informs the optical PNC to bind the TE-tunnel label
          with the VPN instance, which has been created previously in
          step d).
       j) The optical PNC informs this binding information (i.e.,
          ingress/egress interfaces from packet domain and the TE-
          tunnel label) to the optical ingress switch.
       k) The packet PNC 1 informs the ingress PE in Domain 1 to use
          the TE-tunnel label for this VPN instance. The Ingress PE in
          Domain 2 populates the VRF for the VPN and bind with the TE-
          tunnel label. (Note that the TE-tunnel label would need to be
          PUSHed over the VPN traffic).
       l) When the packets arrives at the ingress PE in Domain 1, it
          recognizes the VPN instance and PUSHes the VPN label and the
          TE-tunnel label and forward the traffic to optical ingress
          switch.

       m) The optical ingress switch recognizes the TE-tunnel label and
          encapsulate the whole data packet including TE-tunnel label
          into the OTN payload.
       n) The optical egress switch POPs the ODU label and forwards the
          data packet to the packet egress PE.
       o) The packet egress PE in Domain 2 POPs the TE-tunnel label and
          forwards the VPN packets to the destination CE.

     Note: in steps l) - m), the assumption made was that the packet
     ingress PE is not OTN-capable router. If the packet ingress PE
     supports channelized OTN interfaces, the data plane behavior in
     steps l) and m) would change as the following:

          l') When the packets arrives at the ingress PE, it recognizes
          the VPN instance and PUSHes the VPN label and the TE-tunnel
          label and the ODU label and forward the traffic to optical
          ingress switch.

          m') The optical ingress switch recognizes the incoming ODU
          label and swap it to outgoing ODU label.


3.3. POI with multiple packet domains and multiple optical domains

     This section provides a specific deployment scenario for POI.
     Specifically, it provides a deployment scenario in which
     hierarchical controllers (an MDSC and two packet PNCs and two
     optical PNCs) facilitate optical bypass tunnel across two packet
     domains and two optical domains.

     Figure 3 shows this scenario.

   Figure 3. Two Packet Domains and One Optical Domain

     The control sequence depicted in Figure 3 is same as the control
     sequence a)-c) in Section 3.1 with the following differences:

       d) The MDSC asks the optical PNC 1 to create a tunnel for this
          VPN instance whose endpoints are the ingress PE of the packet
          domain 1 and the optical inter-domain interface toward
          optical domain 2; and the optical PNC 2 to create a tunnel
          for this VPN instance whose endpoints are the optical inter-
          domain interface from optical domain 1 and the egress PE of
          the packet domain 2. The MDSC and Optical PNC 1 and PNC 2
          need to maintain an instance ID for this VPN instance.
       e) The MDSC asks the Packet PNC 2 to bind a TE-tunnel label with
          the VPN ID and the Ingress and Egress interfaces of the
          underlay optical tunnel.
       f) The packet PNC 2 in turn asks the Egress PE to allocate a TE-
          tunnel label. The Egress PE allocates a TE-tunnel label,
          populates the VRF for this VPN instance, and updates the
          packet PNC 2 with the allocated TE-tunnel label. Please refer
          to the note below on the details of this procedure in regard
          to VPN binding.

          Note: There are two cases for binding network instance with
          the TE tunnel label:

            1. VRF instance does not exist.
            2. VRF instance has already been created.

          For case 1, the Egress PE needs to bind the TE-tunnel label
          and the VPN information (e.g., VPN instance name, VPN label,
          RD, RT, Destination IP address, etc.) and inform this binding
          information to the packet PNC 2.

       g) The packet PNC 2 informs the MDSC the allocated TE-tunnel
          label for the VPN instance.



Lee, et al.               Expires April 2019                  [Page 11]

Internet-Draft    ACTN Applicability to VPN with POI       October 2018

       h) The MDSC informs the packet PNC 1 the allocated TE-tunnel
          label for the VPN instance.
       i) The MDSC informs the optical PNC 1 and PNC 2 to bind the TE-
          tunnel label with the instance, which has been created
          previously in step d).
       j) The optical PNC 1 informs this binding information (i.e.,
          ingress/egress interfaces from packet domain and the TE-
          tunnel label) to the optical ingress switch in Domain 1.
          Likewise, the optical PNC 2 to the optical egress switch in
          Domain 2. (Note we assume that the optical border switches in
          Domains 1 and 2 would do the normal OTN switching).
       k) The packet PNC 1 informs the ingress PE in Domain 1 to use
          the TE-tunnel label for this VPN instance. The Ingress PE in
          Domain 2 populates the VRF for the VPN with the TE-label.
          (Note that the TE-tunnel label would need to be PUSHed over
          the VPN traffic).
       l) When the VPN packet arrives at the ingress PE in Domain 1, it
          recognizes the VPN label and PUSHes the TE-tunnel label and
          forward the traffic to optical ingress switch in optical
          domain 1.
       m) The optical ingress switch in optical domain 1 recognizes the
          TE-tunnel label and encapsulate the whole data packets
          including TE-tunnel label into the OTN payload.
       n) The optical egress switch in optical domain 2 POPs the OTN
          label and forwards the data packet to the packet egress PE.
       o) The packet egress PE in Domain 2 POPs the TE-tunnel label and
          forwards the VPN packet to the destination CE.

     Note: in steps l) - m), the assumption made was that the packet
     ingress PE is not OTN-capable router. If the packet ingress PE
     supports channelized OTN interfaces, the data plane behavior in
     steps l) and m) would change as the following:

          l') When the packets arrives at the ingress PE, it recognizes
          the VPN instance and PUSHes the VPN label and the TE-tunnel
          label and the ODU label and forward the traffic to optical
          ingress switch in Domain 1.

          m') The optical ingress switch in Domain 1 recognizes the
          incoming ODU label and swap it to outgoing ODU label.

3.4. Transport of Tunnel and VPN information

     The discussions in Section 3 as to the transport mechanism of the
     TE-tunnel label used for the underlay bypass tunnel with the VPN
     instance information has the undertone of making use of the
     controllers. Note that other mechanisms may also be possible and

Internet-Draft    ACTN Applicability to VPN with POI       October 2018

     that such mechanisms are not precluded when solutions are sought
     out.


3.5. Virtual Switching Instance (VSI) Provisioning for L2VPN

     The VSI provisioning for L2VPN is similar to the VPN/VRF provision
     for L3VPN. L2VPN service types include:

     . Point-to-point Virtual Private Wire Services (VPWSs) that use
       LDP-signaled Pseudowires or L2TP-signaled Pseudowires [RFC6074];

     . Multipoint Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLSs) that use LDP-
       signaled Pseudowires or L2TP-signaled Pseudowires [RFC6074];

     . Multipoint Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLSs) that use a
       Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) control plane as described in
       [RFC4761] and [RFC6624];

     . IP-Only LAN-Like Services (IPLSs) that are a functional subset
       of VPLS services [RFC7436];

     . BGP MPLS-based Ethernet VPN Services as described in [RFC7432]
       and [RFC7209];

     . Ethernet VPN VPWS specified in [RFC8214] and [RFC7432].

3.6. Inter-domain Links Update

     In order to facilitate inter-domain links for the VPN, we assume
     that the service/network orchestrator would know the inter-domain
     link status and its resource information (e.g., bandwidth
     available, protection/restoration policy, etc.) via some
     mechanisms (which are beyond the scope of this document). We also
     assume that the inter-domain links are pre-configured prior to
     service instantiation.

3.7. End-to-end Tunnel Management

     It is foreseen that the MDSC should control and manage end-to-end
     tunnels for VPNs per VPN policy.

     As discussed in [ACTN-Telemetry], the MDSC is responsible to
     collect domain LSP-level performance monitoring data from domain
     controllers and to derive and report end-to-end tunnel performance
     monitoring information to the customer.

4. POI with VN Recursion Under Multiple Network Operators Control

     [RFC8453] briefly introduces a case for the VN supplied to a
     customer may be built using resources from different technology
     layers operated by different operators.  For example, one operator
     may run a packet TE network and use optical connectivity provided
     by another operator.

     Figure 4, extracted from [RFC8453], shows the case where a
     customer asks for end-to-end connectivity between CE A and CE B, a
     virtual network.  The customer's CNC makes a request to Operator
     1's MDSC.  The MDSC works out which network resources need to be
     configured and sends instructions to the appropriate PNCs.
     However, the link between Q and R is a virtual link supplied by
     Operator 2: Operator 1 is a customer of Operator 2.

     To support this, Operator 1 has a CNC that communicates with
     Operator 2's MDSC.  Note that Operator 1's CNC in Figure 10 is a
     functional component that does not dictate implementation: it may
     be embedded in a PNC.

                   Figure 4: VN Recursion with Network Layers


     The CMI in Figure 4 interfaces Operator 1's CNC with Operator 2's
     MDSC. The functions to perform and the information carried over
     the inter-operator CMI are identical to those of the Customer's
     CNC and Operator 1's MDSC. In other words, the two CMIs depicted
     in Figure 4 are recursive in nature.

     From a data plane perspective, the interaction between operator 1
     and operator 2 is similar to the POI case discussed in section 3.2
     (See Figure 2) with an exception that the packet domains belong to
     operator 1 while optical domain to operator 2.

     The control interface depicted in Figure 4 (i.e., the CNC of
     operator 1 and the MDSC of operator 2) should behave similarly to

4.1. Service Request Process between Multiple Operators

     As discussed previously, the reclusiveness principle applies
     seamlessly over the two CMIs. This implies that Operator 1's MDSC
     needs to pass all customer service requirements transparently to
     Operator 2's MDSC so that Operator 2 should provision its underlay
     network tunnels to meet the service requirements of the original
     customer. The MDSC of Operator 1 should translate/map the original
     customer's intent and service requirements and pass down to the
     corresponding PNC(s) which is(are) responsible for interfacing
     another operator (in this example, Operator 2) that provides

     transport services for the segment of the customer's VN. The PNC
     in turn performs as a CNC when interfacing its southbound with
     Operator 2's MDSC.

     It is possible that additional recursive relationships may also
     exist between Operator 2 and other operators.

4.2. Service/Network Orchestration of Operator 2

     Operator 2 that provides transport service for Operator 1 may also
     need to perform service/network orchestration function just as the
     case for Operator 1.

     From a data plane perspective, the interaction between operator 1
     and operator 2 is similar to the POI case discussed in section 3.2
     (See Figure 2) with an exception that the packet domains belong to
     operator 1 while optical domain to operator 2.

     The control interface depicted in Figure 4 (i.e., the CNC of
     operator 1 and the MDSC of operator 2) should behave similarly to
     that of the MDSC and the PNCs discussed in Section 3.


5. Security Considerations

     This document defines key components and interfaces for managed
     traffic engineered networks.  Securing the request and control of
     resources, confidentially of the information, and availability of
     function, should all be critical security considerations when
     deploying and operating ACTN POI platforms.

     Several distributed ACTN functional components are required, and
     implementations should consider encrypting data that flows between
     components, especially when they are implemented at remote nodes,
     regardless these data flows are on external or internal network
     interfaces.

     From a security and reliability perspective, ACTN POI may
     encounter many risks such as malicious attack and rogue elements
     attempting to connect to various ACTN POI components.
     Furthermore, some ACTN POI components represent a single point of
     failure and threat vector, and must also manage policy conflicts,
     and eavesdropping of communication between different ACTN POI
     components.

     The conclusion is that all protocols used to realize the ACTN POI
     should have rich security features, and customer, application and
     network data should be stored in encrypted data stores. Additional
