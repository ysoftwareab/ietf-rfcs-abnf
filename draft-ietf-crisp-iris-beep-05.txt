1. Introduction and Motivations

   The proposal in this document describes the IRIS [6] application
   transport binding using BEEP [2].  Requirements for IRIS and the
   specification in this document are outlined in CRISP [18].

   The choice of BEEP as the transport substrate is primarily driven by
   the need to re-use an existing, well-understood protocol with all the
   necessary features to support the requirements.  This gives
   implementers a wealth of toolkits and debugging gear for use in
   constructing both servers and clients and allows operators to apply
   existing experience in issues of deployment.  It is also felt that
   the construction of a simple application transport for the specific
   purpose of IRIS would yield a similar, though likely smaller and
   probably less complete, standard after taking into consideration such
   matters as framing, authentication, etc.

   Precedents for using other transport mechanisms in layered
   applications do not seem to fit with the design goals of IRIS.  HTTP
   [14] offers many features employed for use by similar applications.
   However, it is not the intention of IRIS to be put to such uses as
   by-passing fire-walls, co-mingling URI schemes, or any other such
   methods which might lead to confusion between IRIS and traditional
   World Wide Web applications.  Beyond adhering to the guidelines
   spelled out in RFC3205 [15], the use of HTTP also offers many other
   challenges that quickly erode its appeal.  For example, the
   appropriate use of TLS [4] with HTTP is defined by RFC2817 [13], but
   the common use as described in RFC2818 [17] is usually the only
   method in most implementations.

   Finally, the straight use of TCP such as that specified by EPP-TCP
   [16] does not offer the client negotiation characteristics needed by
   a referral application where a single client, in the act of
   processing a query, may traverse multiple servers operating with
   different parameters.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [5].

3. BEEP Profile Identification

   The BEEP profile identifier for IRIS is a URI composed of the IRIS
   schema URN, followed by a slash, followed by an IRIS registry type
   (which is a URN).

   In the use of this profile identifier, the IRIS schema MUST be
   abbreviated according to the rules of IRIS.  This is possible because
   the IRIS schema URN is compliant with XML_URN [19].

   The registry type URN MUST be abbreviated according to the rules of
   IRIS (see [6]).  This is possible because the registry type URN is
   compliant with XML_URN [19].

   The following is an example of an IRIS profile identifier for BEEP.
   It identifies the version of IRIS to match that specified by
   "urn:iana:params:xml:ns:iris1" with a registry type URN of
   "urn:iana:params:xml:ns:dreg1".


     http://iana.org/beep/transient/crisp/iris1/dreg1

   The full ABNF [8] with certain values included from IRIS [6] follows.

     profile            = profile-uri "/" iris-urn "/" registry-urn
     profile-uri        = "http://iana.org/beep/transient/crisp/"
     iris-urn           = // as specified by IRIS
     registry-urn       = // as specified by IRIS

   This URI is used in the "profile" element in BEEP during channel
   creation.  According to the rules of BEEP, multiple "profile"
   elements may be offered thus allowing for a negotiation of the
   version of IRIS to be used for every registry type being served.

   Once this profile is accepted and the channel is created, the state
   of the channel is considered ready to exchange IRIS messages.

4. IRIS Message Packages

   The BEEP profile for IRIS transmits XML [1] containing the requests
   and responses for IRIS registries.  These XML instances MUST be
   encoded as Unicode [9] using the media-type of "application/xml"
   according to RFC3023 [11].

   XML processors are obliged to recognize both UTF-8 and UTF-16 [9]
   encodings.  XML provides for mechanisms to identify and use other
   character encodings by means of the "encoding" attribute in the
   declaration.  Absence of this attribute or a byte order mark (BOM)
   means a default of UTF-8 encoding.  Thus, for compatibility reasons,
   and per RFC 2277 [12], use of UTF-8 is RECOMMENDED with this
   transport mapping.  UTF-16 is OPTIONAL.  Other encodings MUST NOT be
   used.

   A registry type MAY define other message packages that are not IRIS
   XML instances (e.g.  binary images referenced by an IRIS response).

5. IRIS Message Patterns

5.1 Registry Dependent Patterns

   Because each registry type is defined by a separate BEEP profile (see
   [6]), each registry type MAY define a different message pattern.
   These patterns MUST be within the allowable scope of BEEP [2].  If a
   registry type does not explicitly define a message pattern, the
   default pattern is used (see Section 5.2).

   However, each registry type MUST be capable of supporting the default
   pattern (Section 5.2) for use with the <lookupEntity> query in IRIS.

5.2 Default Pattern

   The default BEEP profile for IRIS only has a one-to-one request/
   response message pattern.  This exchange involves sending an IRIS XML
   instance, which results in a response of an IRIS XML instance.

   The request is sent by the client using an "MSG" message containing a
   valid IRIS XML instance.  The server responds with an "RPY" message
   containing a valid IRIS XML instance.  The "ERR" message is used for
   sending fault codes.  The list of allowable fault codes is listed in
   BEEP [2].

6. Server Authentication Methods

6.1 Registry Dependent Methods

   When using the TLS [4] tuning profile in BEEP, it is possible to
   verify the authenticity of the server.  However, a convention is
   needed to conduct this authentication.  This convention dictates the
   name of the authority used by a client to ask for authentication
   credentials so that the server knows which set of credentials to pass
   back.  Because this is dependent on the authority component of the
   URI, each registry type SHOULD define a server authentication method.

   If a registry type does not explicitly define a server authentication
   method, the default method is used (see Section 6.2).

6.2 Default Authentication Method

   The default server authentication method is as follows:

   1.  When connecting to a server, the client MUST present the name of
       the authority to the server using the BEEP [2] serverName
       mechanism.  For instance, if the URI "iris:com/dreg/domain/
       example.com" is being resolved, the client would use the
       serverName="com" attribute during the BEEP session instantiation.

   2.  During TLS negotiation, the server presents to the client a
       certificate for the authority given in serverName.  This
       certificate MUST be an X509 [10] certificate.  This certificate
       MUST contain the authority in either the subjectDN or the
       subjectAltName extension of type dNSName.

   3.  The certificate MUST cryptographically verify according to the
       procedures of TLS.

   4.  The client then checks the content of the subjectDN or dNSName.
       Matching for both the types is case insensitive.  A wildcard
       character ('*') MAY be used as the left-most component of the
       name.  If more than one dNSName is present, a match on any one is
       acceptable.

12. Security Considerations

   Implementers should be fully aware of the security considerations
   given by IRIS [6], BEEP [2], and TLS [4].  With respect to server
   authentication with the use of TLS, see .

   Clients SHOULD be prepared to use the following BEEP tuning profiles:

   o  http://iana.org/beep/SASL/DIGEST-MD5 - for user authentication
      without the need of session encryption.

   o  http://iana.org/beep/SASL/OTP - for user authentication without
      the need of session encryption.

   o  http://iana.org/beep/TLS using the TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
      cipher - for encryption.

   o  http://iana.org/beep/TLS using the TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
      cipher with client-side certificates - for encryption and user
      authentication.

   Anonymous client access SHOULD be considered in one of two methods:

   1.  When no authentication tuning profile has been used.

   2.  Using the SASL anonymous profile: http://iana.org/beep/SASL/
       ANONYMOUS

   IRIS contains a referral mechanism as a standard course of operation.
   However, care should be taken that user authentication mechanisms do
   not hand user credentials to untrusted servers.  Therefore, clients
   SHOULD NOT use the http://iana.org/beep/SASL/PLAIN tuning profile.
