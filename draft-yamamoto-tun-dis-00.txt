Abstract

   Tunnel Endpoint Discovery is an enhancement to the Softwire feature.
   Defining a dynamic tunnel endpoint map allows you to be able to
   dynamically determine a Tunnel Broker peer; however, only the
   receiving client has this ability.  This document frets out the
   problem scope as well as the motivation for specifying such a feature
   within the Softwire protocol.

Internet-Draft     Tunnel End Discovery Prob Statement     February 2007


1.  Introduction

   Devices running the Softwire protocol need to know where to find the
   IPv6 Tunnel End Point (TEP) in the case that IPv6 encapsulation
   method is used.  In this case the TEP provides the IPv6 connectivity,
   just in case native IPv6 connection is not available.  Users want
   plug-and-play devices and services and that most of them do not have
   any knowledge about how the Softwire protocol works or where the
   nearest TEP is located.  It is required to consider the auto-
   discovery of the TEP.  The Softwire protocol deals with the tunnel
   setup handshake and is not part of this auto-discovery feature.


2.  Terminology

   Softwire (SW) - A "tunnel" that is created on the basis of a control
   protocol setup between softwire endpoints with shared point-to-point
   or multipoint-to-point state.  Softwires are generally dynamic in
   nature (they may be initiated and terminated on demand), but may be
   very long-lived.

   Softwire Concentrator (SC) - The node terminating the softwire in the
   service provider network.

   Softwire Initiator (SI) - The node initiating the softwire within the
   customer network.


3.  Redundancy and Bootstrapping

   This feature to Softwire protocol is required for a new machine on
   the network bootstraps itself by obtaining its first policy, and
   secure route discovery in the face of complex topologies and multiple
   secure paths for load-balancing and/or redundancy.  In order to
   deploy a Softwire solution to an existing operators customer base,
   load-balancing and redundancy is required.  Tens of thousand if not
   millions of end devices may require the Softwire service.  This would
   mean that hundreds of Softwire network devices within the operators
   network would be needed.  Load-balancing and redundancy within these
   Softwire devices (i.e., Softwire Concentrators) requires an auto-
   discovery feature to Softwire that is transparent to the end user.
   An example of a scenario is a common cause of service outages are
   powering problems with the active network elements (such as a utility
   power outage, a power supply failure, or simply a blown fuse).  By
   protecting against these failures within the Softwire service,
   operators can ensure overall network reliability in all but a handful
   of instances.

4.  Roaming

   Nomadic roaming is different from seamless roaming.  Nomadic roaming
   is best described as the use of an 802.11-enabled laptop in an office
   environment.  As an example, suppose a user of this laptop has
   network connectivity while seated at his desk and maintains
   connectivity to a single AP.  When the user decides to roam, he
   undocks his laptop and walks over to a conference room.  Once in the
   conference room, he resumes his work.  In the back-ground, the 802.11
   client has roamed from the AP near the user's desk to an AP near the
   conference room.  This type of roaming is deemed nomadic because the
   user is not using network services when he roams, but only when he
   reach his destination.

   It is critical with Nomadic roaming that an auto-discovery feature be
   deployed for end hosts or routers using the Softwire service.  In
   order to maximize the value of WiMAX or WiFi technology connectivity
   for nomadic users roaming must be transparent to them.  This has been
   largely achieved by cellular providers and the same can be done
   between all forms of wireless broadband access.  Softwire deployment
   must take into account this existing transparency and an auto-
   discovery solution for enabling network operators and service
   providers to bring Softwire subscribers and varying underlying
   network types together, both from a technology and business
   perspective, but the Softwire protocol as a whole must also work
   toward resolving challenges that could stand in the way of end-user
   adoption.


5.  Security considerations

   The auto-discovery protocol feature to Softwire must prevent a
   malicious node from interjecting his own IP related information such
   that service goes through the bad node.  Please see the Softwire
   Security Analysis document for more details on various security
   threats overall.


6.  Conclusion

   The draft [1] is a memo that analyses the different approaches for
   configuring the IPv6 tunnel endpoint on a node.  This document only
   servers to provide the problem scope and motivation.
