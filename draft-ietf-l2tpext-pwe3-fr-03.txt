Abstract


   The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol, Version 3, (L2TPv3) defines a
   protocol for tunneling a variety of data link protocols over IP
   networks.  This document describes the specifics of how to tunnel
   Frame-Relay over L2TPv3, including frame encapsulation, virtual-
   circuit creation, deletion, and line status change notification.

   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].



1. Introduction


   [L2TPv3] defines a base protocol for Layer 2 Tunneling over IP
   networks. This document defines the specifics necessary for tunneling
   Frame-Relay over L2TPv3. Such emulated circuits are referred to as
   Frame-Relay Pseudowires (FRPWs).


   Protocol specifics defined in this document for L2TPv3 FRPWs include




Townsley, et al.            Standards Track                     [Page 2]






INTERNET DRAFT          Frame-Relay over L2TPv3               March 2004



   those necessary for frame encapsulation, PVC creation, deletion, and
   status change notification.  Support for Switched Virtual Circuits
   (SVCs) and Switched/soft Permanent Virtual Circuits (SPVCs) are
   outside the scope of this document.


   The reader is expected to be very familiar with the terminology and
   protocol constructs defined in [L2TPv3].


1.1 Abbreviations


   FR    Frame-Relay
   FRPW  Frame-Relay Pseudo-Wire
   LCCE  L2TP Control Connection Endpoint (See [L2TPv3])
   PVC   Permanent virtual circuit
   PW    Pseudo-Wire
   VC    Virtual circuit


2. Control Connection Establishment


   In order to tunnel a Frame-Relay circuit over IP using L2TPv3, an
   L2TPv3 Control Connection MUST first be established as described in
   [L2TPv3]. The L2TPv3 SCCRQ Control Message and corresponding SCCRP
   Control Message MUST include the Frame-Relay PW Type of TBD1 (See
   IANA Considerations Section), in the Pseudo Wire Capabilities List as
   defined in 5.4.3 of [L2TPv3]. This identifies the control connection
   as able to establish L2TP sessions to support Frame-Relay Pseudo-
   Wires (FRPWs).


   An LCCE MUST be able to uniquely identify itself in the SCCRQ and
   SCCRP messages via a globally unique value. By default, this is
   advertised via the structured Router ID AVP [L2TPv3], though the
   unstructured Hostname AVP [L2TPv3] MAY be used if both endpoints
   support an application (as defined by the Application Code AVP
   [L2TPv3]) to identify LCCEs via this value.


3. PVC Status Notification and Session Establishment


   This section specifies how the status of a PVC is reported between
   two LCCEs. This includes what should happen when a PVC is created,
   deleted or when it changes state between ACTIVE and INACTIVE.


3.1 L2TPv3 Session Establishment


   PVC creation (provisioning) results in establishment of an L2TP
   session via the standard three-way handshake described in section
   3.4.1 of [L2TPv3]. An LCCE MAY initiate the session immediately upon
   PVC creation, or wait until the PVC state transitions to ACTIVE
   before attempting to establish a session for the PVC. Waiting until




Townsley, et al.            Standards Track                     [Page 3]






INTERNET DRAFT          Frame-Relay over L2TPv3               March 2004



   the PVC transitions to ACTIVE may be preferred as it delays
   allocation of L2TP resources until absolutely necessary.


   The Circuit Status AVP (see Section 4) MUST be present in the ICRQ
   and ICRP messages, and MAY be present in the SLI message for FRPWs.


   Following is an example of the L2TP messages exchanged for an FRPW
   which is initiated after a new PVC is provisioned and becomes ACTIVE.


         LCCE (LAC) A                     LCCE (LAC) B
      ------------------               ------------------
      FR PVC Provisioned
                                       FR PVC Provisioned
      FR PVC ACTIVE


                   ICRQ (status = 0x03) ---->


                                       FR PVC ACTIVE


                   <---- ICRP (status = 0x03)


      L2TP session established,
      OK to send data into tunnel


                       ICCN ----->
                                    L2TP session established,
                                    OK to send data into tunnel


   In the example above, an ICRQ is sent after the PVC is created and
   becomes ACTIVE. The Circuit Status AVP indicates that this PVC is
   ACTIVE and New (0x03). The Remote End ID AVP [L2TPv3] must be present
   in the ICRQ in order to identify the PVC (together with the identity
   of the LCCE itself as defined in section 2) to associate the L2TP
   session with. The Remote End ID AVP defined in [L2TPv3] is of opaque
   form and variable length, though one MUST at a minimum support use of
   an unstructured four-octet value that is known to both LCCEs (either
   by direct configuration, or some other means). The exact method of
   how this value is configured, retrieved, discovered, or otherwise
   determined at each LCCE is outside the scope of this document.


   As with the ICRQ, the ICRP is sent only after the FR PVC transitions
   to ACTIVE as well. If LCCE B had not been provisioned for the PVC
   identified in the ICRQ, a CDN would have been immediately returned
   indicating that the circuit was not provisioned or available at this
   LCCE.  LCCE A should then exhibit a periodic retry mechanism. The
   period and maximum number of retries MUST be configurable.


   An Implementation MAY send an ICRQ or ICRP before a PVC is ACTIVE, as




Townsley, et al.            Standards Track                     [Page 4]






INTERNET DRAFT          Frame-Relay over L2TPv3               March 2004



   long as the Circuit Status AVP reflects that the PVC is INACTIVE and
   an SLI is sent when the PVC becomes ACTIVE (see Section 3.3).


   The ICCN is the final stage in the session establishment, confirming
   the receipt of the ICRP with acceptable parameters to allow
   bidirectional traffic.


3.2 L2TPv3 Session Teardown


   In the event a PVC is deleted (unprovisioned) at either LCCE, the
   associated L2TP session MUST be torn down via the CDN message defined
   in Section 3.4.3 of [L2TPv3].


   General Result Codes regarding L2TP session establishment are defined
   in [L2TPv3]. Additional Frame-Relay result codes are defined as
   follows:


        TBD2: FR PVC was deleted permanently (no longer provisioned)
        TBD3: FR PVC has been INACTIVE for an extended period of time


3.3 L2TPv3 Session Maintenance


   FRPW over L2TP makes use of the Set Link Info (SLI) control message
   defined in [L2TPv3] to signal Frame-Relay link status notifications
   between LCCEs. This includes ACTIVE or INACTIVE notifications of the
   VC, or any other parameters that may need to be shared between the
   tunnel endpoints or LCCEs in order to provide proper PW emulation.
   The SLI message is a single message that is sent over the L2TP
   control channel signaling the state change. Since the message is
   delivered reliably, there is no additional response or action
   required of the PW subsytem to ensure that the state change
   notification was received by the tunnel peer.


   The SLI message MUST be sent any time there is a circuit status
   change which may be reported by any values identified in the Circuit
   Status AVP. The only exception to this is the initial ICRQ, ICRP and
   CDN messages which establish and teardown the L2TP session itself
   when the PVC is created or deleted.  The SLI message may be sent from
   either LCCE at any time after the first ICRQ is sent (and perhaps
   before an ICRP is received, requiring the peer to perform a reverse
   Session ID lookup).


   All sessions established by a given control connection utilize the
   L2TP Hello factility defined in Section 4.4 of [L2TPv3] for session
   keepalive. This gives all sessions basic dead peer and path detection
   between LCCEs.

INTERNET DRAFT          Frame-Relay over L2TPv3               March 2004



3.4 Use of the Circuit Status AVP for Frame-Relay


   Frame-relay circuit status is reported via the Circuit Status AVP
   defined in [L2TPv3]. For reference, this AVP is shown below:


    0                   1
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |           Reserved        |A|N|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   The Value is a 16 bit mask with the two least significant bits
   defined and the remaining bits reserved for future use. Reserved bits
   MUST be set to 0 when sending, and ignored upon receipt.


   The A (Active) bit indicates whether the FR PVC is ACTIVE (1) or
   INACTIVE (0).


   The N (New) bit indicates whether the circuit status indication is
   for a new FR PVC (1) or an existing FR PVC (0).


4. Encapsulation


4.1 Data Packet Encapsulation


   The FR PDU is transported in its entirety, excluding the opening and
   closing HDLC flags and the FCS. Bit stuffing is undone. The L2TPv3
   Session Header is that as defined in [L2TPv3]. If sequencing or other
   features require presence of an L2-Specific Sublayer, the Default
   format defined in section 4.6 of [L2TPv3] MUST be used.


   The FR header is defined in [Q922], however the notation used differs
   from that used in IETF specifications. For reference the FR header in
   IETF notation is:


    0                   1
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | hi dlci   |C|0|lo dlci|F|B|D|1|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Two-octet FR Header


    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | hi dlci   |C|0| dlci  |F|B|D|0|   dlci      |0| dlci_lo   |0|1|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

INTERNET DRAFT          Frame-Relay over L2TPv3               March 2004



   Four-octet FR  Header


   C/R (bit 6)
   FR frame C/R (command/response) bit [Q922].


   F - FECN (bit 12):
   FR FECN (Forward Explicit Congestion Notification) bit [Q922].


   B - BECN (bit 13):
   FR BECN (Backward Explicit Congestion Notification) bit [Q922].


   D - DE (bit 14)
   FR DE bit indicates the discard eligibility [Q922].


   Usage of the C/R, FECN, BECN and DE bits is as specified in [Q922].


   The C/R bit is conveyed transparently. Its value MUST NOT be changed
   by the LCCE.


   The FECN bit MAY be set by the LCCE to notify the receiving end-user
   that the frames it recieves have encountered congestion. The end-user
   may use this indication for destination controlled transmit rate
   adjustment. The bit must never be cleared by the LCCE. If the LCCE
   does not support FECN it shall pass the bit unchanged.


   The BECN bit MAY be set by the LCCE to notify the receiving end-user
   that frames it transmits may encounter congestion. The end-user may
   use this indication to adjust its transmit rate. The bit must never
   be cleared by the LCCE. If the LCCE does not support BECN it shall
   pass the bit unchanged.


   The DE bit MAY be set by a policing function on the LCCE to indicate
   that this frame SHOULD be discarded in preference to other frames in
   a congestion situation. The bit must never be cleared by the LCCE. If
   the LCCE does not support DE it shall pass the bit unchanged.


4.2 Data Packet Sequencing


   Data Packet Sequencing MAY be enabled for FRPWs. The sequencing
   mechanisms described in [L2TPv3] MUST be used for signaling
   sequencing support. FRPW over L2TP MUST request the presence of the
   L2TPv3 Default L2-Specific Sublayer when sequencing is enabled, and
   MAY request its presence at all times.


   If the FRPW is known to be carrying data which does not require
   packet order to be strictly maintained (such as IP), then packet
   sequencing for the FRPW SHOULD NOT be enabled.

5. Security Considerations


   Frame Relay over L2TPv3 is subject to the security considerations
   defined in [L2TPv3]. There are no additional considerations specific
   to carrying Frame Relay that are not present carrying other data link
   types.


6. IANA Considerations


   The following value needs assignment by IANA (number space should be
   created as part of publication of [L2TPv3]):


      TBD1 - Frame Relay Pseudowire Type (see Pseudo Wire Capabilities
      List as defined in 5.4.3 of [L2TPv3]).


   Two new L2TP Result Codes appear in section 3.2 which need assignment
   by IANA as described in section 9.1 of [BCP0068].


      TBD2 - PVC was deleted permanently (no longer provisioned)


      TBD3 - PVC has been INACTIVE for an extended period of time


7. Acknowledgments


   The first Frame Relay over L2TP document was published as "Frame
   Relay Service Type for L2TP," draft-vasavada-l2tpext-fr-svctype-
   00.txt in Feburary of 2001 by Nishit Vasavada, Jim Boyle, Chris
   Garner, Serge Maskalik, and Vijay Gill. This document is
   substantially different, but the basic concept of carrying Frame
   Relay over L2TP is the same.
