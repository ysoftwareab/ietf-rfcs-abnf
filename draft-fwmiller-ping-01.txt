Abstract

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has the potential for long
   periods of time to elapse when no signaling traffic is sent between a
   User Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS).  There are
   situations when it is advantageous to have some signaling traffic
   flow periodically between these endpoints or to have a quick,
   lightweight check whether a UAS is alive.  The PING method is
   proposed that can be used for these purposes.

1.  Introduction

   Two SIP entities pass signaling traffic between them as required to
   support SIP-based services.  There can be long periods of time either
   when session is established or when no session exists when no traffic
   is flowing between the endpoints.  There are situations where some
   signaling traffic should be sent between the UAC and UAS.  For
   example, if one of the endpoints is behind a Network Address
   Translation (NAT), signaling traffic may be needed to keep the NAT
   port bindings alive.  The PING method is intended to confirm that the
   endpoints are alive and verify that a signaling path is still valid.

2.  PING Method

   The PING method is used to determine if a UAS is alive and to
   validate a signaling path.  The PING method is not used to change the
   state of SIP calls, nor does it change the state of sessions
   initiated by SIP.  Rather, it provides an indication to both ends of
   a session that signaling messages can still flow between them.

   A PING request may be sent at any time.  PINGs may be sent
   periodically to serve as a heartbeat.  A UAC MUST NOT have more than
   one outstanding PING transaction in existence at any time with a
   specific UAS.

   The only interval specified in this standard is that subsequent PING
   requests MUST be sent with at least a minimum of 500 milliseconds
   between them.

   A PING request is routed the same way any other request is routed.
   This can be either direct signaling between the UAC and UAS or a
   signaling path involving SIP servers that potentially add themselves
   to the Record-Route headers.

   PING requests are sent unreliably.  This means that a UAC sends a
   single PING request to an UAS, and waits for a response.  If no
   response arrives before the expiration interval, the transaction is
   terminated and the UAC is notified that not response was received.
   It is up to the UAC to decide whether another PING is sent.  If it
   is, the new PING request represents a new PING transaction.

2.1.  Header Field Support for PING Method

   The PING request does not carry any information other than the intent
   to check for the liveness of the UAS and the signaling path validity.
   As such, only a few headers are used in both the PING request and its
   associated response.

                     Header             Where    PING
                     ------             -----    ----

   implementations (particularly for servers) to optimize PING message
   processing.

2.2.  Response to the PING Method

   A UAC formats a PING request as desired and sends it to the UAS.  The
   request is sent using the same routing rules by which an OPTIONS non-
   INVITE transaction would be sent.  The request is sent unreliably,
   i.e. it is not retransmitted.  The UAC waits 5 seconds for a
   response.  If a response is received or the UAC times out waiting for
   a response, the PING transaction is considered terminated and the UAC
   is notified of the outcome.

                            UAC        UAS
                             |          |
                             |   PING   |
                             |--------->|
                             |          |
                             |  200 OK  |
                             |<---------|
                             |          |

   There is only one defined response to a PING messages.  This means
   that a UAS that receives, recognizes, and supports the PING method
   MUST only send one possible response back to the UAC.

   The defined response is a 200 OK response.  A UAS that supports
   reception of the PING method MUST respond immediately with a 200 OK
   message when it receives a PING request.

   If a UAS that does not support the PING method receives a PING
   request, it will generate other responses, e.g. a 501 Not Implemented
   per [1].  A UAC SHOULD accept any response other than a 1xx
   provisional response or a 3xx redirection.  If a response other than
   a 1xx or a 3xx is received, the UAC SHOULD assume that the UAS does
   not recognize or support the PING method but the UAC SHOULD accept
   the response as if it were a 200 OK response.  A UAC receiving a 1xx
   or 3xx response SHOULD drop the response as if it were never
   received.

2.3.  Message Body Inclusion

   A PING request MUST NOT contain a message body.

2.4.  User Agent Behavior

   Unless otherwise stated, the protocol rules for the PING request
   governing the usage of tags, Route, and Record-Route, retransmission

   and reliability, CSeq incrementing and message formatting follow
   those in [1] as defined for the OPTIONS request.

   A PING request MAY NOT be canceled.

2.5.  Behavior of SIP Proxy and Redirect Servers

2.5.1.  Proxy Server

   Unless stated otherwise, the protocol rules for the PING request at a
   proxy are identical to those for a OPTIONS request as specified in
   [1].

2.5.2.  Forking Proxy Server

   Unless stated otherwise, the protocol rules for the PING request at a
   proxy are identical to those for a OPTIONS request as specified in
   [1].

2.5.3.  Redirection Server

   Unless stated otherwise, the protocol rules for the PING request at a
   proxy are identical to those for a OPTIONS request as specified in
   [1].

3.  Security Considerations

   The only security consideration is that of a Denial of Service (DoS).
   A "PING Storm" DoS attack can be launched at a UAS if PING requests
   are sent at closer intervals than 500 milliseconds.  Even 500
   milliseconds can be considered tight.  It is RECOMMENDED that PING
   request intervals be at least several seconds if possible.
