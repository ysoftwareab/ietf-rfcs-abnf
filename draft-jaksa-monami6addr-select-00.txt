Abstract

   When a correspondent node (CN) initiates a session with a multi-homed
   Mobile Node (MN), it should choose the "best" destination address
   based on the available information about the MN.  Presently there is
   no mechanism allowing the MN to indicate on which interface (i.e.,

   address) a CN may reach it.  This draft documents a method whereby
   the MN may communicate to the CN address selection preferences so
   that the CN may initiate a session to the desired address (interface)
   for of the MN.  The method is based on the notion of storing address
   selection preference information for the MN in the DNS.

Internet-Draft        Destination address selection            June 2006


1.  Introduction

   A mobile node will have in the future multiple network interfaces,
   and the best decision to select an interface and an access network
   from other possible combinations has to be taken.  This decision will
   depend on several things such as: user preferences, requirements from
   applications, device capabilities, available network interface cards
   and their performances, available access networks and their
   capabilities, etc.  [6]

   Using MONAMI6 [5] technologies a multi-homed Mobile IPv6 Node [1] is
   able to use multiple interfaces at the same time, according to some
   preference settings.  This will allow the MN to achieve load sharing,
   load balancing and aggregated bandwidth when sessions are initiated
   by the MN.

   When a correspondent node (CN) initiates a session with the MN, it
   should choose the destination address depending on the available
   information about the MN.  Presently there is no mechanism allowing
   the multi-homed MN to indicate on which address (or interface) a CN
   may reach it.  If only the MN addresses are known by the distant node
   (CN), the CN is unable to choose the "best" destination address of
   the multi-homed MN.  It is on the MN that the profile management
   database resides and there is a strong requirement for the MN to
   communicate interface selection preferences about itself to the to
   the CN.

   This write-up reviews over the Destination Address Selection when
   initiating a connection with a Multi-homed MN.  The document also
   examines possible ways that the DNS may aid this process.


2.  Terminology

   See [2] for mobility terminology used in this document.


3.  Destination Address Selection for a Multi-homed MN

   In general a host is able to gain knowledge about its local
   connections than about conditions at a remote location.  For a multi-
   homed MN this would include such things as: user preferences,
   application QoS requirements, access network types for each
   interface, etc.  On the destined CN, most commonly applications
   sequentially try destination addresses from the getaddrinfo API [4].

   MONAMI6 mechanisms provide Mobile IPv6 support for mobile nodes with
   multiple addresses or multiple interfaces used simultaneously, i.e.

   multihomed mobile nodes.  MONAMI6 extensions deployed on the MN means
   that MIPv6 will simultaneously work with all of its addresses or
   interfaces.  This means that either a single Home Address (HoA) will
   be associated with a set of interfaces or a single interface is
   associated with one HoA or a single interface associated with
   multiple HoAs.

3.1.  Analysis of DNS with MONAMI6 destination address selection

   Although the CoA may be a global IPv6 address, it is only the HoAs of
   the MONAMI6 MN that are stored in the DNS.  Again, generally
   applications will sequentially try destination addresses received
   from the DNS resolver.  If there are more than one HoA for the
   MONAMI6 MN, the default address selection is provided in [3].
   Currently, this selection doesn't take into account the MONAMI6 MN
   connection profile which is managed locally.  Another case is when
   there exists a single HoA associated with multiple interfaces.  Here
   the application would be unaware of the fact that there are multiple
   interfaces as it would only receive a single HoA from the DNS.

   It has been stated in [5] and [4] that DNS may be used as an approach
   of helping the CN choose the most appropriate destination address.
   This would mean that the MN would need to be able to communicate to
   the CN through stored information in the DNS its preferences for
   connection.  For the case whereby there is a single HoA for multiple
   interfaces, information received from the DNS would not help the
   application in its destination address selection.  Here the CoA
   information would be required to distinguish which of the MNs
   interface to initiate a connection on.

   In the case whereby there are Multiple HoAs stored in the DNS as AAAA
   records, then it would be possible to store MN preference information
   along with the HoAs in the DNS.  This may aid the application in
   selecting the "best" destination address.  The next subsections will
   examine existing DNS resource records to see in what manner such
   preference information might be stored.

3.1.1.  WKS Resource Record

   The WKS DNS resource record will provide to the CN applications
   information about which services are available at a host.  Such
   information is coupled with the nodes IP address and can be
   associated with the MONAMI6 MNs HoAs.  The record has the following
   format: ip-address protocol service.  Here, ip-address is the IPv4
   address of the server, protocol is a protocol such as tcp or udp, and
   service is a list of services, such as http or ftp, and port numbers.
   Here specific services could initiate connections to the on one HoA
   for the MN and others services initiate connections to the MN on

Internet-Draft        Destination address selection            June 2006


   other HoAs.  This could be a way for at least providing MN preference
   information per HoA based on services and storing such information in
   the DNS.  At the moment there is no IPv6 equivalent of WKS records.

3.1.2.  SRV Resource Record

   SRV records provide a better way of dealing with services.  However,
   such records are not intended to be per host.  The SRV record instead
   offers a way to list services for a domain name.  Through DNS
   configuration of the SRV record, a set of SRV records could apply to
   a host.  In this way a service on the CN may use a the hostname
   (FQDN) and service name to query for the proper SRV records for the
   multi-homed MN.  The service would receive the SRV record return by
   the DNS in order to choose the best HoA.  The SRV has priority and
   weight values per HoA that represent the preference of the MN for
   which HoA that the service should select.  The SRV records would need
   to be dynamically updated as the local conditions of the MN change.

3.1.3.  Summary of DNS usage

   It is difficult to count on DNS for any reliable info concerning the
   reachability of a ever changing MONAMI6 Mobile Node.  However, given
   some specific scenarios in which some service related preferences
   remain static and the access network types for the MN are more likely
   to always be available, then the DNS can provide some simple and
   powerful information to the application on the CN in determining the
   destination address selection of a multi-homed MN.

   We examined existing DNS resource records that may be applicable in
   aiding the destination address selection process when attempting to
   establish a connection to a multi-homed MN.  People in DNS community
   also have strong opinions on who can register information in DNS so
   we choose not to invent new DNS resource records.  However, a need
   may exist for a multi-homed host-centric DNS solution - one in which
   a Multi-homed Mobile Node may be able to state its preferences for
   which HoA that the application should select (in the event that MN
   has multiple HoAs).


4.  Destination Address Selection Requirements

   As a side to the central focus of this draft we wish to provide some
   input into requirements for any solution (DNS or transport supported)
   that may be developed to aid in the CNs decision to choose the "best"
   MN address or interface in which to initiate a connection to.
   1.  The mechanism MUST periodically re-evaluate the mappings between
       flows and interfaces to take into account the quality changes on
       the different interfaces (or addresses).

Internet-Draft        Destination address selection            June 2006


   2.  The mechanism MUST be Dynamic Adaptive in that after re-
       evaluation of the mappings and update is done so that flows are
       adjusted immediately or that new initiated connections reflect
       the current preference settings of the MONAMI6 MN.
   3.  The mechanisms SHOULD provide various granularity in its
       mappings.  Such granularities examples include mappings of
       service to addresses (interfaces), mappings of source address to
       destination addresses (interfaces), and load balancing mappings
       from the context of the MN.
   4.  The mechanism MUST provide rapid reaction to topology changes.
   5.  The mechanisms MUST provide a secured way for the MN to update
       the mappings.


5.  Security Considerations

   Dynamic DNS would be the method used for the MN to dynamic update the
   information stored for address selection preferences.  This would be
   required to be secured when performing these updates.


6.  Conclusion

   Destination address or interface selection by the CN when initiating
   a connection could be aiding by anyone of the various levels - IP
   level, MIPv6, Transport, or DNS (application).  This document
   analyzed when it might be useful aid the selection via the DNS and
   possible deficiencies with current resource records.  We also
   concluded with some requirements - a starting point - when developing
   these mechanisms (at any level).  We hope that this write-up frets
   out some issues that have only preliminary been discussed in the
   MONAMI6 working group and that this information helps this debate.
