                       SFC dynamic instantiation
                 draft-lee-sfc-dynamic-instantiation-00

Abstract

   SFC instantiation may be static or dynamic.  In a static
   instantiation, specific SF instances are predetermined by network
   operator's configuration or policy.  However, since it does not
   consider the current state of network resources such as availability
   of the SF instances, the static instantiation may create more
   vulnerable SFPs to state changes of the network resources such as
   failure or overload.  This document specifies SFC dynamic
   instantiation capability to create and update SFPs considering
   traffic optimization, failover of SFIs, and load balancing.

1.  Introduction

   The current service delivery model is bound to static topologies and
   manually configured resources.  This has motivated a more flexible
   deployment model which orchestrates the service delivery separated
   from the network.  Service function chaining
   [I-D.ietf-sfc-problem-statement] provides a new service deployment
   model that delivers the traffic along the predefined logical paths of
   service functions (SFs), called service function chains (SFCs) with
   no regard of network topologies or transport mechanisms.  A SFC is
   determined by classification of target traffic based on operator and
   customer policy.  Since it is described with logical SFs, the service
   function chain needs to be instantiated by selecting instances of the
   SFs, which results in a service function path (SFP).

   The SFC remains still if there are no changes in the operator's
   policies for the target traffic.  However, the SFP may vary in time
   with resource state of SF instances and underlying transport at the
   instantiation to support traffic optimization, failover of service
   function instances (SFIs), or load balancing.  For example, an
   instance of SF_A can be replaced by another instance of SF_A deployed
   at a different service node (SN) when the former one fails to
   function.

   This document specifies SFC dynamic instantiation capability to
   create and update SFPs considering traffic optimization, failover of
   SFIs, and load balancing.  Based on the capability and the use cases,
   SFC architecture needs to consider the attributes of resources for SF
   instances at control plane.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms and most of them were
   reproduced from [I-D.ietf-sfc-problem-statement] and
   [I-D.quinn-sfc-arch].

   o  Classification: Locally instantiated policy and customer/network/
      service profile matching of traffic flows for identification of
      appropriate outbound forwarding actions.

   o  Service Function (SF): A function that is responsible for specific
      treatment of received packets.  A Service Function can act at the
      network layer or other OSI layers.

   o  Service Function Instance (SFI): The instantiation of Service
      Function that can be a virtual instance or be embedded in a
      physical network element.  One of multiple Service Functions can
      be embedded in the same network element.  Multiple instances of
      the Service Function can be enabled in the same administrative
      domain.

   o  Service: An offering provided by an operator that is delivered
      using one or more service functions.  This may also be referred to
      as a composite service.

   o  Service Node (SN): Physical or virtual element that hosts one or
      more service functions and has one or more network locators
      associated with it for reachability and service delivery.

   o  Service Function Chain (SFC): A service Function chain defines an
      ordered set of service functions that must be applied to packets
      and/or frames selected as a result of classification.  The implied
      order may not be a linear progression as the architecture allows
      for nodes that copy to more than one branch.  The term service
      chain is often used as shorthand for service function chain.

   o  Service Function Path (SFP): The instantiation of a SFC in the
      network.  Packets follow a service function path from a classifier
      through the requisite service functions.

3.  SFC instantiation

   Service function chaining provides 3-level abstraction of the network
   for service delivery: SFC overlay, Service Function Path (SFP), and
   Service Function Chain (SFC).

   The physical resources for Service Functions and their connectivity
   are abstracted as a SFC overlay.

   An ordered set of service functionalities per traffic is specified by
   a SFC.  The SFC can be further deployed by a SFP which specifies the
   logical functions with their physical instances.

   Under this abstraction, the traffic flows are forwarded along the
   SFPs which can be obtained by two separate steps: classification and
   SFC instantiation.

   o  Classification: SFCs are selected and identified by a
      classification function according to the traffic steering policy
      defined by network operators.  The policy just defines which
      service functions must be applied to traffic flows in specific
      orders.  It does not consider which network resources are
      available or ready for the service functions.

   o  SFC instantiation: In order to forward the traffic flows along the
      SFC, it needs to be instantiated to a SFP by selecting the
      specific instances of the service functions given in the SFC
      considering the state of resources and transport.

   For example as depicted in Figure 1, {SFC: SF1 -> SF2 -> SF3} is
   selected for a traffic flow by the classification function.  This SFC
   can be further instantiated to two different SFPs: {SFP#1: SF1_a ->
   SF2_b -> SF3_a} and {SFP#2: SF1_a -> SF2_a -> SF3_b} by selecting one
   of multiple instances of the service functions.

   The SFC instantiation may be static or dynamic.  In a static
   instantiation, specific SF instances are predetermined by network
   operator's configuration or policy.  The static instantiation may be
   more convenient for network administrators because they can easily
   expect the result and troubleshooting locations.  However, since it
   does not consider the current state of network resources such as
   availability of the SF instances, the static instantiation may create
   more vulnerable SFPs to state changes of the network resources such
   as failure or overload.

4.  Dynamic instantiation of SFC

   In a dynamic SFC instantiation, SF instances are selected considering
   attribute of the network resources at time of demand, specifically:

   o  SF instances for every SF given are selected to construct a
      complete SFP before starting to forward traffic flows along the
      SFP

   o  SF instance is selected or replaced at time of delivering the
      traffic flow to the SF

   The use of two different methods for creating SFPs depends on use
   cases of the dynamic SFC instantiation as follows:

   o  Traffic optimization: constructs SFPs with low stress and stretch
      considering the different locations of multiple SF instances.

   o  Load balancing: selects SF instances to distribute load for the
      traffic considering the current status of SF instances or service
      nodes where the instances are embedded.

   o  Failover of SF instance: selects live SF instances and replaces SF
      instances in failure by checking their availability.

   In order to support those use cases, the criteria to select one of
   multiple service function instances (SFIs) may vary but mainly from
   state of network resources and attributes of traffic flow such as:

   o  Availability, load, performance of SF instances, service nodes,
      SFP transport links (among SF instances)
