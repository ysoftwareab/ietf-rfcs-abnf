Internet-Draft         IPDVB Address Configuration          October 2005


1.  Introduction

   Future IPDVB networks will require a more powerful IP address
   configuration management as it is currently provided in such
   networks.  The required configuration may depend on the offered
   services transmitted via DVB.  Current discussions within the IPDVB
   working group have shown that the future usage scenarios and
   requirements for dynamic configuration of IP addresses and other
   parameters are not yet clearly defined.  Other parameters can be, but
   are not limited to, multicast addresses, application level gateways
   (proxies), DNS servers, etc.  This memo identifies the problem space,
   sketches possible future scenarios, and gives an outlook in related
   areas.  The IP address mapping to layer 2 identifier, known as IP
   address resolution, and the reverse way are out of scope of this
   memo.  This topic is discussed in [5].

   The IPDVB working group has defined a new encapsulation scheme to
   transport IP over DVB (MPEG-2 based) networks, the so-called
   Unidirectional Lightweight Encapsulation [1].  This protocol assumes
   that IP addresses have already been assigned to hosts, DVB receivers,
   and that hosts are already aware of other networking related
   parameters, such as IP gateway, DNS server, etc.  Where today IP
   addresses are statically assigned to those receivers, future
   deployments may require  more flexible IP address assignment
   mechanisms such as the ones known from today's LANs, for instance,
   via DHCP [3] [4].  Assigning IP addresses dynamically opens the path
   for further IPv4 and IPv6 auto-configuration of DVB receivers.

   This memo is a problem statement only and is intended to start
   discussions within the IPDVB working group on how IP addresses and
   additional related information can be configured dynamically.
   Comments and discussions should be sent to the IPDVB's mailing list
   at ipdvb@erg.abdn.ac.uk.  The working group charter is available
   here:  http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ipdvb-charter.html.

   Section 2 introduces the network configuration for IPDVB networks.
   Section 3 describes two scenarios in details.  Section 4 suggests the
   requirements to which a possible auto-configuration solution would
   comply.  The document concludes with Section 5 listing similar areas
   of interest.

   The terminology used throughout this memo is defined in [2].

2.  Network Set-up Scenarios

   The basic assumption for IPDVB networks with respect to IP address
   configuration is the number of possible receivers (hosts) within a
   single IP subnetwork.  It is assumed that future IPDVB networks can
   extend to 1*10E5 receivers per subnetwork but can also be limited to
   10 or less receivers per subnetwork.  This possible number of hosts
   must be considered when describing scenarios and later the solution.
   However, the remainder of this section discusses different network
   scenarios with respect to their topology in the Internet and DVB
   network.

2.1  Hybrid Bi-directional Set-up - Scenario 1

   Figure 1 sketches a hybrid interactive topology, where the downlink
   is a DVB trunk and the uplink is based on a common (wired or
   wireless) data networking technology.  The (unidirectional) DVB
   downlink can be either cable, satellite or terrestrial, whereas the
   (bi-directional) uplink can be, but is not limited to, ISDN, DSL,
   WLAN/WMAN, or cellular networks based.

                    Figure 1: Hybrid set-up: scenario 1

   The network provider's domain is connected to both, the DVB network
   and IP bi-directional interaction network.  Upon activation of the
   user terminal, a bi-directional connection is thus established
   between the receiver and the provider of the interaction network.
   This communication is mostly based on asymmetric data flow, where
   data destined to the user are included in the DVB downlink, and the

   uplink is mainly used for requests/acknowledgments and other related
   signalling.

   Typical scenarios would include set-ups as:

   o  DVB-S/S.2 with PSTN/ISDN (fixed broadband access)

   o  DVB-T with PSTN/ISDN/xDSL/WLAN/WMAN (fixed terrestrial)

   o  DVB-H with GPRS/3G (mobile use)


2.2  DVB-based Bi-directional Set-up: Scenario 2

   Figure 2 shows a scenario where the DVB receiver utilizes DVB-based
   technologies for both the downlink (DVB-S, DVB-T, DVB-H) and the
   uplink (DVB-RCS, DVB-RCT).  Such a configuration will be used, for
   instance, on ships while being at sea with a DVB-S only solution
   available.  In this case, DVB-RCS can be used for interaction.  In
   another scenario, DVB-RCT can be used as an uplink in fixed or mobile
   DVB-T/DVB-H reception, as an alternative to using a cellular network.
   In all these configurations, all information, including IP addresses,
   must be transmitted via the DVB links.

2.3  DVB-based unidirectional Set-up: Scenario 3

   This is a scenario similar to a today's common usage of DVB
   broadcast, as is shown in  Figure 3.  The DVB part is an unicast link
   and all data is broadcasted to all receivers.  This configuration is
   mainly used today for TV broadcasts services (based on MPEG-2) but it
   can be used to broadcast IP data to the DVB receivers too.  In such
   case, DVB receivers do not have the ability to interact with any
   external entity for configuration purpose.  Address information can
   be delivered from a network provider to the receivers by a push
   mechanism only.  However, a fine-grained unicast IP address
   configuration per receiver does not to be very likely in this case,
   since configuration of broadcast or multicast groups is mostly
   appropriate.

   Unicast IP address assignment should anyway be supported for the
   (scarce but possible) case of operator-initiated unicast push.  This
   could be the scenario when a client issues a request for a block of
   information (e.g. a movie) to be sent to it via a voice telephone
   call or an SMS.

3.  Configuration Scenarios

3.1  Static IP configuration

   This scenario assumes that the IP address of the user terminal along
   with its networking (and DVB-related) parameters have been pre-
   configured.  This is an acceptable solution for fixed reception,
   where the number of users is relatively small.  No additional
   protocol and signalling are required.

3.2  IP configuration via the interaction network

   The following operation is intended for scenario 1.  Figure 1 shows
   such a configuration example.  The DVB receiver will obtain its basic
   IP address configuration via the non-DVB uplink (most likely via ISDN
   and PPP, xDSL or 3G/GPRS).  The interaction network assigns an IP
   address, dynamic or static, public or private, to the connected
   client.  This address can represent the terminal as a whole (i.e.
   there is no need to allocate a second IP address for the DVB receive-
   only interface).

   In any case, the  scenario of the IP address being configured by the
   interaction network requires  additional configuration to be loaded
   at the DVB receivers.  Possible configurations include:

   o  IP service information, such as DNS server, proxies, etc

   o  multicast configuration and routing information

   o  broadcast configuration (service_id or PID in which the IP data
      can be found, encapsulation method [ETH] ULE or MPE)

   o  security configuration, e.g., keys, policies, IPsec parameters.


3.3  Complete Bootstrap

   Scenarios 2 and 3 can require a complete bootstrap of DVB receivers
   without any pre-configuration available at the IP level.  Those DVB
   receivers may be pre-configured to known a basic DVB configuration,
   such as PID assignment for a special data stream containing auto-
   configuration data.  Such a receiver would need to retrieve first an
   IP address and learn about its IP environment (netmask, IP next hop,
   ...).  Figure 2 shows such a scenario where a DVB receiver (and
   transmitter) is installed aboard a ship  and is a gateway between the
   ship's network and the DVB network.  The complete bootstrap scenario
   includes the one shown in Figure 3 too.

4.  Requirements for dynamic IP configuration

   Any proposed mechanism for the dynamic configuration of the host's
   networking parameters should fulfil certain requirements.
   Specifically, its necessary features should be:

   1.  Scalability: In contrast to LANs or dial-up environments, in
       which DHCP or PPP is used, a DVB service can be addressed to
       thousands of users.  The mechanism should be able to process
       numerous client requests and assign addresses from a large pool.

   2.  Support for both IPv4 and IPv6: Current DVB receivers support
       mostly IPv4, because MPE is IPv4-oriented.  The forthcoming ULE
       supports IPv4 and IPv6 in an equal manner, so both protocols must
       be supported.  It might be desirable that a single IP address is
       assigned to each receiver and not multiple ones (e.g. one for the
       DVB interface and a second for the interactive interface).

   3.  Configuration of IP-related parameters: In addition to client IP
       address, more configuration operations such as gateway address,
       DNS server address, domain name and IPsec parameters must be
       performed.

   4.  Configuration of DVB-related parameters: These parameters such as
       service_id or PID where the data destined to the user are to be
       found as well as encapsulation method used (ULE or MPE).
       Although the association between IP and DVB parameters is
       actually an address-resolution issue, it would be quite helpful
       for the receiver to know in advance the TS logical channel
       containing its data, before having to employ an AR protocol or
       browse into the INT table (which is anyway impractical for a
       large number of receivers).  Anyway, regardless of the signalling
       issue, it is the auto-configuration mechanism which should
       allocate a TS Logical Channel (TSLC) for each user.  Depending on
       the number of associated receivers, this relation could be other
       than one-to-one (i.e., one TSLC could correspond to multiple
       users, or a user could retrieve information from multiple TSLCs).

   5.  Support for authentication mechanisms: The DVB broadcast downlink
       is 'open' to anyone, but it is rational to assume that
       bidirectional access is restricted only to authorized receivers.
       Before sending the IP parameters the dynamic configuration server
       would follow an authentication process to validate the identity
       of the client terminal.

   6.  Handover support: In the case that the receiver moves across
       neighbouring DVB macrocells (in the terrestrial scenario mostly),
       the dynamic configuration mechanism should cooperate with the

       handover backplane to ensure that IP connectivity is maintained
       in the destination cell.  The operator can choose either to keep
       the same IP parameters or allocate new ones to the client
       terminal upon associating it to the new DVB cell.  In the case of
       SFN implementation, this issue does not exist, as the same
       multiplex is present in all transmitters, and no handover process
       actually takes place.

5.  Related Work

   Configuration of DVB networks, or more generally MPEG-2 based
   networks, are tackled in several other environments with different
   prerequisites.  The IP over Cable Data Networks (IPDCN) working group
   is working in this area and is specifying several MIB modules with
   respect to MPEG2 network configuration.  DVB itself has defined
   several mechanisms to configure receivers, such as system information
   tables (SI tables), or within MHP.

   Configuration of IP hosts is the focus of the Network Configuration
   (NETCONF) working group, Dynamic Host Configuration (DHC) working
   group, defined in several RFC documents (IPv4 Address Resolution
   Protocol (ARP), IPv6 neighbour discovery (ND)) etc.

6.  Conclusions

   This memo is the first attempt to answer the questions on how future
   IPDVB networks can deal with dynamic IP address configuration.  Open
   questions are:

   o  What are the configuration scenarios?

   o  What exactly should be configured?

   o  How to configure?

   o  Who is in control of the receiver?  The operator is in control of
      the receiver in the case of MHP.  Users running a DVB PC adaptor
      have full control over their receiver and network operators
      running their routers on DVB networks are likely not to give away
      control over their equipment.

   o  Is it right to assume that the network provider and DVB network
      operator are the same entity?  For DVB only access networks this
      might be true, but for future scenarios it is unlikely that the
      DVB network operator and IP network operator is the same entity.

   During the first discussions at the 61st IETF some differences
   between IPDVB and other network configuration techniques have been
   noted.  The NETCONF approach is made for a single router
   configuration and is not intended to configure thousands of host.
   IPCDN on the other hand considers 1*10e3 hosts per cable head end to
   be configured.  IPDVB may consider up to 1*10e5 hosts per segment,
   see Section 2.  This must be definitely taken into account when
   devising a solution.

   Further discussions amongst the authors have raised the concern about
   the density of the hosts per subnetwork.  Initially, it has been
   assumed that IPDVB-based subnetworks can consist out of 1*10e5 hosts,
   because of the broadcast nature of DVB.  This raises the scalability
   issue of any solution.

   This memo is neither accurate nor complete at this point of time and
