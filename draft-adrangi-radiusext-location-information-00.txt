   1. Introduction  
    
    Wireless LAN (WLAN) Access Networks (AN) are being deployed in 
    public places such as airports, hotels, shopping malls, and coffee 
    shops by a diverse set of incumbent operators such as cellular 
    carriers (GSM and CDMA), Wireless Internet Service Providers 
    (WISP), and fixed broadband operators.    
     
    When a Public Wireless Local Area Network (PWLAN) client connects 
    to a PWLAN AN, the information pertaining to the PWLAN AN location 
    and operational ownership needs to be conveyed to the PWLAN 
    client∆s Home Service Network (HSN). The intent of PWALN AN 
    location-related information is to enable use case scenarios for 
    location aware billing (e.g., determine the appropriate tariff and 
    taxation), location aware subscriber authentication / authorization 
    in roaming, and location aware services.   
      
    Standard bodies / forums (such as 3GPP, 3GPP2, GSMA) and WiFi 
    Alliance public access III have already defined Vendor Specific 
    Attributes (VSA) with different format/syntax and content for 
    indicating location-related information.  However, common 
    understanding and Standardization of these attributes is essential 
    to enable improved interoperability and hence successful 
    deployments of PWLANs. 
     
    This document describes AAA attributes that are used by an AAA 
    client or a local AAA server/proxy in an AN for conveying location-
    related information to the HSN AAA server.  The attributes are 
    described for RADIUS [1].

   1.2 Applicability 
    
      Although proposed attributes in this draft are intended for PWLAN 
      deployments, they can also be used in other networks (e.g., wired 
      networks) where location-aware services are required. 
       
 
   1.3 Requirements language 
 
      In this document, several words are used to signify the 
      requirements of the specification.  These words are often 
      capitalized.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
      "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", 
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as 
      described in [RFC2119]. 
    
   1.4 Terminology 
    
      Access Network (AN) 
          The PWLAN hotspot network that provides wireless connectivity 
          to the Internet for WLAN clients (or stations) present in the 
          local access area. This MAY be in a separate security and 
          routing domain with respect to the Home Service Network or a 
          Mediating Network. 
       
      Home Service Network (HSN) 
          The network providing the service and therefore maintaining 
          the direct relationship to the user/subscriber of the WLAN 
          service. All AAA functions are ultimately performed by the 
          HSN. 
 
      Access Point (AP) 
         A station that provides access to the distribution services 
         via the wireless medium for associated Stations. 
    
      RADIUS server 
         This is a server which provides for 
         authentication/authorization via the protocol described in 
         [1], and for accounting as described in [6].  It is deployed in 
         the PWLAN AN, MN, and HSN. 
 
   2. Overview  
    
     The AN location and operational ownership information is conveyed 
     in three AAA attributes which are: Operator-Name, Location-Name, 
     and Location-Information.  The description of these attributes is 
     as follows.  
    
   2.1 Operator-Name Attribute 
 
  
   Adrangi, et al.           Expires June 2004               [Page 3]
    
   Internet Draft       Access Network Location Information 
               
 
     This attribute contains an operator name which uniquely identifies 
     the ownership of an AN.  The Attribute value is a non-NULL 
     terminated string whose Length MUST NOT exceed xxxx.  The 
     attribute value is comprised of the prefix and the Identity, 
     separated by a colon.  The prefix identifies the operator type; 
     example: GSM, CDMA.  And, the Identity uniquely identifies the 
     operator name within the scope of the operator type.  Examples: 
     GSM:TADIC where GSM is a prefix indicating an operator type and 
     TADIC is a unique globally known GSM operator ID.  
      
     This document defines three prefixes which are: GSM, CDMA, and 
     REALM.   
    
   2.2 Location-Name Attribute 
         
     This attribute contains country name, telephone area code, city 
     name where an AN is located, and location type of the AN such as 
     airport, hotel, coffee shop, bookstore, and etc.  E.164 [3] format 
     is used for identifying country name and telephone area code. A 
     city name is a non-NULL terminated string whose length MUST NOT 
     exceed 64 octets.  This document defines the following integer 
     codes for AN location type: 
       
                   
                0 Reserved 
                1 Coffee Shop 
                2 Hotel 
                3 Airport 
                4 Shopping Mall 
                5 Restaurant  
                9 Library 
               10 Convention Center 
               11 School 
               12 Enterprise 
               13 Airplane 
               14 Train 
 
   2.3 Location-Information Attribute 
 
     This attribute contains a descriptive information in English 
     language about the AN∆s Location that can be printed into 
     subscriber∆s detailed bill. The information is presented as a non- 
     NULL terminated string whose length MUST NOT exceed 64 octets.   
 
   3. Operation  
      
     Operation  is  identical  to  that  defined  in  RADIUS  AAA 
     specifications [1][2].
