1.  Introduction


   Autonomous System Confederations for BGP describes an extension to
   BGP which may be used to create a confederation of autonomous systems
   that is represented as a single autonomous system to BGP peers
   external to the confederation, thereby removing the "full mesh"
   requirement inherent to BGP.  The intention of this extension is to
   aid in policy administration and reduce the management complexity of
   maintaining a large autonomous system.

   This document provides an implementation report for Autonomous System
   Confederations for BGP as defined in draft-ietf-idr-
   rfc3065bis-05.txt.

   The editor did not verify the accuracy of the information provided by
   respondents or by any alternative means.  The respondents are experts
   with the implementations they reported on, and their responses are
   considered authoritative for the implementations for which their
   responses represent.

   Does your implementation follow the procedures outlined in the
   Operation Section of [RFC3065bis]?

     ALCATEL: YES
     Cisco: YES
     ECI: YES



2.2.  AS_CONFED Segement Types and AS_PATH Handling


   Does your implementation recognize the two AS_CONFED Segment Types
   (AS_CONFED_SET and AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE) defined in [RFC3065bis]?

     ALCATEL: YES
     Cisco: YES
     ECI: YES

   transactions with peers that are members of the same BGP
   confederation as the local speaker?

     ALCATEL: YES
     Cisco: YES
     ECI: YES

   Does your implementation treat receipt of an AS_PATH attribute
   containing an autonomous system matching its own AS Confederation
   Identifier in the same fashion as if it had received a path
   containing its own AS number?

     ALCATEL: YES
     Cisco: YES
     ECI: YES

   Does your implementation treat receipt of an AS_PATH attribute
   containing an AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE or AS_CONFED_SET which contains its
   own Member-AS Number in the same fashion as if it had received a path
   containing its own AS number?

     ALCATEL: YES
     Cisco: YES
     ECI: YES
