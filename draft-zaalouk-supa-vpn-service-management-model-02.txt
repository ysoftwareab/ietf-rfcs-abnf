                 VPN Service Management YANG Data Model
           draft-zaalouk-supa-vpn-service-management-model-02


Abstract

   Currently new services create new opportunities for both network
   providers and service providers. Simplified Use of Policy
   Abstractions (SUPA) was proposed to develop a model that abstracts
   network resources and services and a methodology by which the
   management and monitoring of network services can be done using
   standardized policy rules. This document defines a VPN service
   management yang data model and gives an example for DDC use case.

1. Introduction

   Currently new services bring new challenges and opportunities for
   both network providers and service providers. Meanwhile, legacy
   services such as VPN [RFC4110] also need specialized management
   and controlling capability from the network management systems to
   improve the experiences for fast deployment and dynamic
   configuration.

   Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) [SUPA-problem-
   statement] [SUPA-framework] was proposed to introduce the concepts
   of multi-level and multi-technology network abstractions to
   address the current separation between development and deployment

   operations. The first example that SUPA will focus on will be VPN
   management.

   This document introduces YANG [RFC6020] [RFC6021] data models for
   SUPA configuration. Such models can facilitate the standardization
   for the interface of SUPA, as they are compatible to a variety of
   protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and [RESTCONF]. Please note
   that in the context of SUPA, the term "application" refers to a
   operational and management applications employed, and possibly
   implemented, by an operator. The first configuration model is
   based on the first example - VPN management.



2. Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS. Lower case uses of these words are not to
   be    interpreted as carrying [RFC2119] significance.



3. Network Configuration Modules

   In this section, several specific network configuration models are
   described based on a set of specific network services and the
   framework of SUPA [SUPA-framework].



3.1. L3VPN Service Module

   A Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN) interconnects sets of
   hosts and routers based on Layer 3 addresses and forwarding. L3VPN
   can be based on MPLS or IP technologies. L3VPN is a PE-based VPN
   managed by operators. L3VPN is widely used in carrier metro
   networks to provide VPN service for enterprise users.

   A L3VPN model is a collection of L3VPN instances. A L3VPN instance
   contains a set of access interfaces to network devices as well as
   other attributes, such as routing protocol, address family,
   topology, and so on.

Internet-Draft VPN Service Management YANG Data Model     March 2015


   To configure a L3VPN instance, the administrator needs to specify
   which port(s) of a network device belongs to a L3VPN instance.
   Those ports and network device information can be derived from a
   network topology model in a network management system. The
   administrator also needs to specify what routing protocol needs to
   be configured for a L3VPN instance.

   The following describes the information model for L3VPN, based on
   which programmers can develop applications to configure L3VPN
   instances.

3.2. Module for DDC services

   The following describes SUPA VPN management model designed for DDC
   services use case [SUPA-DDC]. [SUPA-DDC] took a large-scale
   Internet Data Center (IDC) operator as an example to describe what
   SUPA needs to model including DDC service initiation, VPN-based
   connectivity initiation, traffic adjustment and monitor.

   Module "ietf-supa-ddc" defines generic VPN management aspects
   which are common to all DDC services use case regardless of their
   type of vendor. In effect, the module can be viewed as providing a
   generic VPN management for DDC services.
