Abstract

   If a node lacks an IP address, it cannot yet participate in ad hoc
   networks as currently designed, because the connectivity in an ad hoc
   network is typically determined by mechanisms that depend upon using
   the IP address as the identifier for the nodes in the ad hoc network.
   In this document, a mechanism by which a node in an ad hoc network
   may autoconfigure an IP address which is unique throughout the
   connected portion of the ad hoc network is specified.  Specifically,
   mechanisms for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks, which are isolated from
   Internet connectivity, are described.

1. Introduction

   If a node lacks an IP address, it cannot yet participate in ad hoc
   networks as currently designed, because the connectivity in an ad
   hoc network is typically determined by mechanisms that depend upon
   using the IP address as the identifier for the nodes in the ad hoc
   network.  In this document, a mechanism by which a node in an ad hoc
   network may autoconfigure an IP address which is unique throughout
   the connected portion of the ad hoc network is specified.  Mechanisms
   for configuring both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, as appropriate, are
   specified.

Internet Draft     Ad Hoc Address Autoconfiguration     14 November 2001


   When a node in an ad hoc network wishes to obtain an IP address,
   it may be difficult or impossible to contact any address
   allocation agency in the network.  In such cases, according to the
   specifications given in this document, the node attempts to select a
   random address (on network 169.254/16 in case of IPv4, or on prefix
   MANET_INITIAL_PREFIX in case of IPv6).  This is analogous to the way
   that Autonet allocations are done, and as is proposed in the zeroconf
   working group [3].


2. Applicability Statement

   The mechanisms described in this document do not guarantee uniqueness
   in disconnected networks.  If a network is disconnected, the process
   for Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) would need to be performed
   again when the network partition heals.  This document does not
   specify any method for detecting when the network partition heals,
   nor any procedure by which such detection would cause new attempts at
   DAD. Any such specification would have to ensure that network healing
   is not accompanied by a broadcast storm of DAD messages.

   The mechanisms designed in this document are designed to work
   independently of the protocols (i.e., routing or MAC) utilized within
   the protocol stack.


3. Terminology

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].  This
   section defines other terminology used with AODV that is not already
   defined in [2].

      Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)

         The process by which a node, which lacks an IP address,
         determines whether a candidate address it has selected
         is available.  A node already equipped with an IP address
         participates in DAD in order to protect its IP address from
         being accidentally misappropriated for use by another node.

      Address Discovery

         The process by which a node in an ad hoc network discovers
         whether an address is already claimed within an ad hoc network.

      Address Request (AREQ)

         The message used during address discovery to request the
         address.

      Address Reply (AREP)

         The message used during address discovery to indicate the
         requested address is already utilized.


4. Overview

   This protocol specifies how an IPv4 or IPv6 Manet node autoconfigures
   itself an address and executes a protocol exchange to check for
   uniqueness of this address within the reachable Manet.  The protocol
   specifies address ranges for IPv4, and IPv6 from which to locally
   select the address and a message exchange for the uniqueness test of
   the selected address.

   A Manet node performing the autoconfiguration picks two addresses,
   a temporary address and the actual address to use.  The former is
   used only once in the uniqueness check to minimize the possiblity
   for it to be non-unique.  The uniqueness check is based on sending
   an Address Request (AREQ) and expecting an Address Reply (AREP)
   back in case the address is not unique.  In case no AREP is
   received, the uniqueness check is passed.  For IPv4, the messages
   are ICMP [5] packets.  For IPv6, on the other hand, the AREQ is a
   modified Neighbor Solicitation and the AREP is a modified Neighbor
   Advertisement, as specified below and in the Neighbor Discovery
   Protocol [4, 6].

   The format of the IPv6 Address Request message is illustrated above,
   it being a modified Neighbor Solicitation as defined in RFC 2461 [4]
   and used in RFC 2462 [6].  It contains the following modifications to
   NDP:

      Manet Neighbor Solicitation Flag (M)
                 When set, this flag indicates that this Neighbor
                 Solicitation message should be sent over a multi-hop
                 network.  It indicates that the packet is used with
                 a Manet Duplicate Address Detection over the Manet
                 instead of only sending it one hop to the immediate
                 neighbors.

      Requested IPv6 Address
                 The locally selected IPv6 address that is being
                 requested by the node issuing the address request.
                 This address may be chosen by selecting e.g., at random
                 a host number from a suitable prefix, by default from a
                 site-local prefix MANET_PREFIX.

   IP Fields:

      Hop Limit
                 This field SHOULD be set to NET_DIAMETER to allow for
                 the modified NDP packet to traverse multiple hops up to
                 the edge of the Manet.

   The format of the IPv6 Address Reply message is illustrated above.
   It is a modified Neighbor Advertisement as defined in RFC 2461 [4]
   and used in RFC 2462 [6].  It contains the following modifications to
   NDP:

      Manet Neighbor Advertisement Flag (M)
                 When set, this flag indicates that this Neighbor
                 Advertisement message should be sent over a multi-hop
                 network.  It indicates that the packet is used with

                 neighbors.

      Requested IPv6 Address
                 The IPv6 address that is being requested by the node
                 issuing the address request.  This address was chosen

   IP Fields:

      Source Address
                 This address is not link-local and belongs to the
                 sender of the AREP. It SHOULD BE the same as the
                 Requested IPv6 Address.

      Destination Address
                 This is the site-local, short-lived temporary address
                 from the site-local prefix MANET_INITIAL_PREFIX, with a
                 host number randomly picked by the sender of the AREQ,
                 used only once in the address uniqueness messages.
                 This address is also used as the IPv6 UID.


6. IPv4 Address Autoconfiguration

6.1. Address Request (AREQ)

   Following the suggestions for DAD as with IPv6 Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration [6] and zeroconf [3], the node first picks a random
   IP address in the range FIRST_PERM_ADDR - 65534 from 169.254/16.
   This is the IP address for which it will issue the address request.
   The node then selects a random, temporary IP address in the range 0
   - LAST_TMP_ADDR. This ID will serve as a source IP address for the
   short period while the node performs the address discovery.  Then,
   the node issues an Address Request (AREQ) for that randomly selected
   address.  The packet format for the AREQ is given in section 5.
   The node places its randomly selected source IP address in the the
   Originator's IPv4 Address field.  The node then broadcasts this
   request to its neighbors.  It then sets a timer for ADDRESS_DISCOVERY
   milliseconds, and proceeds as described in section 6.3.


6.2. Address Request Processing

   When a node receives an AREQ message, the node first notes the
   Requested_IP_Address and Originator's IPv4 Address.  It checks its
   buffered list of AREQ message identifiers to determine whether it has
   seen this request before.  If it has already seen this request, it
   discards the packet.  Otherwise, the node enters the values of these
   fields into a temporary buffer.  These two values serve to uniquely
   identify the request.  If the node receives this request again as
   the packet is rebroadcast by its neighbors, it will note that it

   has already received the request, and hence will not reprocess the
   packet.

   Next, the node creates a reverse route entry for the node indicated
   by the Originator's IPv4 Address field.  It enters this destination
   address in its route table, and uses the node from which it received
   the AREQ as the next hop towards the source node.  The node enters
   a lifetime for this route of REVERSE_ROUTE_LIFETIME. In this way,
   if the node later receives an AREP, the node will have a current
   route to the source node.  Hence it will be able to forward the AREP
   towards the source node.

   The node then checks whether its own IP address matches the requested
   address in the AREQ. If the node's IP address does not match the
   requested address, it rebroadcasts the packet to its neighbors.

   On the other hand, if the node has the same IP address as that in
   the AREQ, the node MUST reply to the packet.  To do so, it creates
   an Address Reply (AREP) packet.  The packet format for the AREP is
   given in section 5.  It copies the Requested_IP_Address from the AREQ
   message, and places them in the AREP. It then unicasts this packet
   to the source node, as indicated by the source IP address in the IP
   header of the received AREQ message.  The reverse route that was
   created by the AREQ broadcast is used to route the AREP back to the
   source node.


6.3. Address Reply Processing

   When a node originates an AREQ, it sets a timer for ADDRESS_DISCOVERY
   milliseconds.  During that time, it waits for the reception of an
   AREP. If no AREP is returned for the selected address within a
   timeout period, the node retries the AREQ up to AREQ_RETRIES times.
   If, after all retries, no AREP is still received, the node assumes
   that the address is not already in use, and that the address can
   safely be taken for its own.

   On the other hand, if the node does receive an AREP within the
   discovery period, and if the Requested_IP_Address match its recorded
   values, then this indicates that another node within the ad hoc
   network is currently using that Requested_IP_Address.  In this case,
   the node randomly picks another address from the same FIRST_PERM_ADDR
   - 65534 range and begins the ad hoc DAD procedure again.

7. IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration

7.1. Overview

   This section describes the steps specific to an IPv6 Manet node
   taken when autoconfiguring an address to its interface.  The steps
   described here adhere to the principles in IPv6 stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration [6], but with changes as specified below.

   When an IPv6 node performs Manet address autoconfiguration, it first
   obtains a non-link-local prefix from which to configure an address.
   The prefix cannot have link-local scope because the address is valid
   over a multiple hop distance, not only to the immediate neighbors.
   The method to obtain a globally routable prefix may be the Internet
   Gateway Discovery, as described in Global Connectivity for Mobile Ad
   Hoc Networks [7].

   In case the node does not know any suitable prefix, it uses the
   MANET_PREFIX, with prefix length 64, reserved for this purpose.

   The node also acquires another temporary address for the sole use
   of an AREQ-AREP protocol message exchange for the uniqueness check
   of the chosen address.  This second, temporary address is chosen
   from the MANET_INITIAL_PREFIX. The non-temporary actual address to
   configure is from the part of the MANET_PREFIX not overlapping with
   MANET_INITIAL_PREFIX.

   Hence, unlike in NDP, stateless Manet autoconfiguration occurs
   whether Manet router advertisements are present or not.

   The node selects a host number as in IPv6 stateless address
   autoconfiguration and concatenates this to the prefix.  After this,
   the node performs a uniqueness check to this address, as specified
   below.


7.2. Address Request and Reply

   To check for address uniqueness, the node sends an Address Request
   (AREQ) and expects to receive an Address Reply (AREP) if the
   tentative address is already in use within the reachable Manet.  The
   AREQ is a modified Neighbor Solicitation containing the tentative
   address.  The AREP is a modified Neighbor Advertisement response to
   the request.  Message formats for IPv6 AREQ and AREP are given in
   section 5.

   The IPv6 node broadcasts the AREQ to the all-nodes multicast
   address as the destination address in the IPv6 header.  The source
   address is a temporary one.  It MUST be picked at random from the



Perkins, et. al.              Expires 14 May 2002               [Page 9]

Internet Draft     Ad Hoc Address Autoconfiguration     14 November 2001


   MANET_INITIAL_PREFIX. This address is only used in this message
   exchange and discarded thereafter.  Uniqueness of this address is
   based on its short lifetime.  A node does the uniqueness check only
   once for an address and the domain for these short-lived addresses is
   as large as the IPv4 address space.

   After sending the AREQ the node then sets a timer to
   ADDRESS_DISCOVERY milliseconds, and proceeds as described in
   section 6.3.  An AREP is a unicast sent back to the originator of the
   AREQ in case the tentative address was in use by sender of the AREP.
   In case no AREP was received within the timer wait, the tentative
   address is considered valid.

   Address Request and Reply Processing follow the logic for the
   processing of the corresponding IPv4 messages.

   In the case of IPv6, the node unicasts the AREP ADDRESS_RETRIES
   times, to increase robustness, back to the originator.  The return
   path for AREP unicast MAY be the short lived state of AREQ source
   IPv6 address, link-layer source address, originating interface
   triplet which was stored in the intermediate nodes when forwarding
   the AREQ. When this state exists, a node forwarding a data packet
   first looks for the IP destination from that state.  If found, the
   node forwards the packet to the respective link using the stored link
   layer address.


8. Security Considerations

   This document does not define any method for secure operation of
   the autoconfiguration protocol.  The danger exists that a malicious
   node may pretend to have any given IP address, so that another node
   would receive AREP messages apparently denying it the use of whatever
   address it might choose.  This lack of security is problematic for
   many approaches to IP address autoconfiguration.  It is symptomatic
   of the basic conflict between security, and operation in any mode
   where preconfigured information (including security association data)
   is not available.


9. Configuration Parameters

   This section gives default values for some important values
   associated with address discovery protocol operations.
