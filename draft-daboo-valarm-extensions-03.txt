Internet-Draft              VALARM Extensions                   May 2011


1.  Introduction

   The iCalendar [RFC5545] specification defines a set of components
   used to describe calendar data.  One of those is the "VALARM"
   component which appears as a sub-component of "VEVENT" and "VTODO"
   components.  The "VALARM" component is used to specify a reminder for
   an event or to-do.  Different alarm actions are possible, as are
   different ways to specify how the alarm is triggered.

   As iCalendar has become more widely used and as client-server
   protocols such as CalDAV [RFC4791] have become more popular, several
   issues with "VALARM" components have arisen.  Most of these relate to
   the need to extend the existing "VALARM" component with new
   properties and behaviors to allow clients and servers to accomplish
   specific tasks in an interoperable manner.  For example, clients
   typically need a way to specify that an alarm has been dismissed by a
   calendar user, or has been "snoozed" by a set amount of time.  To
   date, this has been done through the use of custom "X-" properties
   specific to each client implementation, leading to poor
   interoperability.

   This specification defines a set of extensions to "VALARM" components
   to cover common requirements for alarms not currently addressed in
   iCalendar.  Each extension is defined in a separate section below.
   For the most part, each extension can be supported independently of
   the others, though in some cases one extension will require another.
   In addition, this specification describes mechanisms by which clients
   can interoperably implement common features such as "snoozing".


2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" are referenced in this document
   outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" and
   "CALDAV:" will be prefixed to the element type names respectively.


3.  Extensible syntax for VALARM

   Section 3.6.6 of [RFC5545] defines the syntax for "VALARM" components
   and properties within them.  However, as written, it is hard to
   extend this by adding, e.g., a new property common to all types of

   alarm.  Since many of the extensions defined in this document need to
   extend the base syntax, an alternative form for the base syntax is
   defined here, with the goal of simplifying specification of the
   extensions.

   A "VALARM" calendar component is re-defined by the following
   notation:

   alarmcext  = "BEGIN" ":" "VALARM" CRLF
                alarmprop
                "END" ":" "VALARM" CRLF

   alarmprop  = *(

                ; the following are REQUIRED,
                ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                action / trigger /

                ; one set of action properties MUST be
                ; present and MUST match the action specified
                ; in the ACTION property

                actionprops /

                ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                ; and MAY occur more than once

                x-prop / iana-prop

                )

   actionprops = audiopropext / disppropext / emailpropext

   audiopropext  = *(

                   ; 'duration' and 'repeat' are both OPTIONAL,
                   ; and MUST NOT occur more than once each,
                   ; but if one occurs, so MUST the other

                   duration / repeat /

                   ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                   ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                   attach

                   )

   disppropext = *(

                 ; the following are REQUIRED,
                 ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                 description /

                 ; 'duration' and 'repeat' are both OPTIONAL,
                 ; and MUST NOT occur more than once each,
                 ; but if one occurs, so MUST the other

                 duration / repeat

                 )

   emailpropext = *(

                  ; the following are all REQUIRED,
                  ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                  description / summary /

                  ; the following is REQUIRED,
                  ; and MAY occur more than once

                  attendee /

                  ; 'duration' and 'repeat' are both OPTIONAL,
                  ; and MUST NOT occur more than once each,
                  ; but if one occurs, so MUST the other

                  duration / repeat

                  )


4.  VALARM Unique Identifier

   Several of the other extensions in this specification require
   identifying a specific instance of a "VALARM" component in an
   iCalendar stream.  To aid that, this extension adds a "UID" property
   to "VALARM" components to allow a unique identifier to specified.
   The value of this property can then be used to refer uniquely to the
   "VALARM" component.

   The "UID" property defined here follows the definition in Section
   3.8.4.7 of [RFC5545].  In particular it MUST be a globally unique
   identifier.

Internet-Draft              VALARM Extensions                   May 2011


   The "VALARM" component defined in Section 3 is extended here as:

   alarmprop  /= *(

                 ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                 ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                 uid

                 )


5.  VALARM URI Action

   Currently "VALARM" components have actions for audio, display and
   email.  New types of action are of interest, e.g., SMS, instant
   messaging, etc.  Rather then specify separate actions for these, an
   alternative is to define a "URI" action that allows any URI scheme to
   be used as an action, where it makes sense.  Thus URI schemes for IM
   [RFC3860], SIP [RFC3261], TEL [RFC3966] etc could be used.

   This extension defines a new "URI" property value for use with the
   "ACTION" property in "VALARM" components.  A new set of action
   properties is defined for "VALARM" components based on this new
   action as defined by the syntax below.

   actionvalue /= "URI"
                  ; Adds a new action for a "VALARM"

   actionprop  /= uriprop
                  ; Re-defines the "VALARM" component to include
                  ; "uriprop" as a new set of action properties

   uriprop     = *(

                  ; the following is REQUIRED,
                  ; and MUST occur only once

                  uri /

                  ; 'duration' and 'repeat' are both OPTIONAL,
                  ; and MUST NOT occur more than once each,
                  ; but if one occurs, so MUST the other

                  duration / repeat

                  )

6.  VALARM Agent Property

   With the advent of a standard client/server protocol for calendaring
   and scheduling data ([RFC4791]) there is a need to specify which
   client or server should handle the presentation of an alarm when it
   is triggered.  For example, calendar users want to be able to receive
   alarms at all times, even when their desktop client might be
   unavailable.  Since the server is "always on", a service running on
   the server could monitor alarm status and, when appropriate, trigger
   those alarms.  In addition it may be important for only the server or
   the client to be set to handle an alarm - and in some cases only
   specific servers or clients.

   To address this need, this specification defines an "ALARM-AGENT"
   iCalendar property that can be added to any "VALARM" component.  This
   property specifies whether a client or server or both should be
   responsible for processing the alarm when it triggers.  In addition,
   a "ID" property parameter can be added to uniquely identify the
   client or server that should process the alarm.  This is defined by
   the syntax below.

   alarmprop  /= *(

                 ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                 ; and MAY occur more than once

                 alarm-agent

                 )

6.1.  Alarm Agent Property

   Property Name:  ALARM-AGENT

   Purpose:  This property specifies whether a client, server, both or
      none gets to process an alarm when it is triggered.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA, non-standard, and id property parameters
      can be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified within "VALARM" calendar
      components.

Internet-Draft              VALARM Extensions                   May 2011


   Description:  This property is used to specify who is responsible for
      processing an alarm when it is triggered.  When the value "SERVER"
      is specified, only a server that has a copy of the event is
      responsible.  When the value "CLIENT" is specified, only a client
      that has a copy of the event is responsible.  When the value
      "BOTH" is specified, either a client or server is responsible.
      When the value "NONE" is specified, neither a client nor server is
      responsible (i.e., the alarm action is never carried out when it
      triggers).

      If the "ID" property parameter is specified for "SERVER" or
      "CLIENT" values, then only the client or server identified by the
      "ID" value is responsible.  Clients or servers that are not
      responsible for the alarm SHOULD NOT process the alarm action when
      it is triggered.  If multiple clients or servers need to be
      specified, then the "ALARM-AGENT" property should be included
      multiple times in the "VALARM" component, with each one containing
      the appropriate "ID" property parameter value to identify each
      client or server.

      In the absence of this property clients and servers can choose to
      process the alarm themselves as appropriate. i.e., a default value
      of "BOTH".

      This property MAY occur more than once to allow multiple
      processors of an alarm.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   alarm-agent     = "ALARM-AGENT" alarmagentparam ":"
                     alarmagentvalue CRLF

   alarmagentparam = *(

                     ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                     ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                     (";" idparam) /

                     ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                     ; and MAY occur more than once

                     (";" other-param)

                     )

   alarmagentvalue = "SERVER" / "CLIENT" / "BOTH" / "NONE" /

   Example:  The following are examples of this property:

   ALARM-AGENT:SERVER
   ALARM-AGENT;ID="tag:example.com,2011:cyrus-desktop":CLIENT

6.2.  ID Property Parameter

   Parameter Name:  ID

   Purpose:  This property parameter specifies a URI identifier for the
      property it is applied to.

   Format Definition:  This property parameter is defined by the
      following notation:

   idparam   = "ID" "=" DQUOTE uri DQUOTE

   Description:  This property parameter is used to specify a URI
      identifier that is associated with the property it is applied to.
      Each property that allows this parameter to be specified MUST
      indicate what the value of the URI represents.

   Example:  The following is an example of this property parameter:

   ALARM-AGENT;ID="http://calendar.example.com":SERVER

   TODO Example of VALARM components


7.  VALARM Acknowledged Property

   There is currently no way for a "VALARM" component to indicate
   whether it has been triggered and acknowledged or not.  With the
   advent of a standard client/server protocol for calendaring and
   scheduling data ([RFC4791]) it is quite possible for an event with an
   alarm to exist on multiple clients in addition to the server.  If
   each of those is responsible for performing the action when an alarm
   triggers then multiple "alerts" are generated by different devices.
   In such a situation a calendar user would like to be able to
   "dismiss" the alarm on one device and have it dismissed on the others
   too.

   Also, with recurring events that have alarms, it is important to know
   when the last alarm in the recurring set was acknowledged, so that

Internet-Draft              VALARM Extensions                   May 2011


   the client can determine whether past alarms have been missed.

   To address these needs, this specification adds an "ACKNOWLEDGED"
   property to "VALARM" components to indicate when the alarm was last
   sent or acknowledged.  This is defined by the syntax below.

   alarmprop       /= *(

                      ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                      ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                      acknowledged

                      )

7.1.  Acknowledged Property

   Property Name:  ACKNOWLEDGED

   Purpose:  This property specifies the UTC date and time at which the
      corresponding alarm was last sent or acknowledged.

   Value Type:  DATE-TIME

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified within "VALARM" calendar
      components.

   Description:  This property is used to specify when an alarm was last
      sent or acknowledged.  This allows clients to determine when a
      pending alarm has been acknowledged by a calendar user so that any
      alerts can be dismissed across multiple devices.  It also allows
      clients to track repeating alarms or alarms on recurring events or
      to-dos to ensure that the right number of missed alarms can be
      tracked.

      Clients SHOULD set this property to the current date-time value in
      UTC when a calendar user acknowledges a pending alarm.  Certain
      kinds of alarm may not provide feedback as to when the calendar
      user sees them, for example email based alerts.  For those kinds
      of alarms, the client SHOULD set this property when the alarm is
      triggered and the action successfully carried out.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   acknowledged = "ACKNOWLEDGED" acknowledgedparam ":" datetime CRLF

   acknowledgedparam  = *(

                        ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                        ; and MAY occur more than once

                        )

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

   ACKNOWLEDGED:20090604T084500Z

7.2.  Examples

   TODO Example of VALARM components


8.  Snoozing Alarms

   Users often want to "snooze" an alarm.  That process effectively
   creates a new alarm to be triggered a set amount of time after the
   original being "snoozed".  To accomplish this, clients SHOULD create
   a new "VALARM" component within the same component of the "VALARM"
   that was triggered and is being "snoozed".  The new "VALARM" MUST be
   set to trigger at the user's chosen "snooze" interval after the
   original alarm triggered.  To accomplish that clients SHOULD use an
   absolute "TRIGGER" property with a "DATE-TIME" value specified in
   UTC.  When the "snooze" alarm is triggered and dismissed the client
   SHOULD remove it from its parent component.  Alternatively, if the
   "snooze" alarm is itself "snoozed", the client SHOULD remote the
   original "snooze" alarm and create a new one, with the appropriate

9.  VALARM Proximity Trigger Property

   VALARMs are currently triggered when a specific date-time is reached.
   It is also desirable to be able to trigger alarms based on location,
   e.g. when arriving at or departing from a particular location.

   This specification adds the following properties to "VALARM"
   components to indicate when an alarm can be triggered based on

   location.

      "PROXIMITY" - indicates that a location based trigger is to be
      used and which direction of motion is used for the trigger

      "GEO-LOCATION" - used to indicate the actual location to trigger
      off, specified using a geo: URI [RFC5870] which allows for two or
      three co-ordinate values with an optional uncertainty

                      ; and MAY occur more than once, but only

9.1.  Proximity Property

   Property Name:  PROXIMITY

   Purpose:  This property indicates that a location based trigger is
      applied to an alarm.

   Value Type:  TEXT

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified within "VALARM" calendar
      components.

   Description:  This property is used to indicate that an alarm has a
      location-based trigger.  Its value identifies the direction of
      motion used to trigger the alarm.  One or more location values are
      set using "GEO-LOCATION" properties.

Internet-Draft              VALARM Extensions                   May 2011


      When the property value is set to "ARRIVE", the alarm is triggered
      when the calendar user agent arrives in the vicinity of any of the
      specified locations.  When set to "DEPART", the alarm is triggered
      when the calendar user agent departs from the vicinity of any
      specified locations.

      The time-based "TRIGGER" property MUST also be present in the
      "VALARM" calendar component and MUST be set to a positive duration
      value (or zero duration).  That value indicates a time delay to be
      applied to the triggering of the alarm after the location trigger
      is triggered. e.g., an alarm could be set to trigger 30 minutes
      after arriving home.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   proximity = "PROXIMITY" proximityparam ":" proximityvalue CRLF

   proximityparam  = *(

                     ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                     ; and MAY occur more than once

                     (";" other-param)

                     )

   proximityvalue  = "ARRIVE" / "DEPART" / iana-token / x-name

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

   PROXIMITY:ARRIVE

9.2.  Geo Location Property

   Property Name:  GEO-LOCATION

   Purpose:  This property specifies a geo: URI [RFC5870] value.

   Value Type:  URI

   Property Parameters:  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
      be specified on this property.

   Conformance:  This property can be specified multiple times within
      "VALARM" calendar components, but only when a "PROXIMITY" property
      is also present.

   Description:  This property is used to specify a precise geo-location
      that location aware calendar user agents can use to trigger an
      alarm.  The location is set using a geo: URI [RFC5870] which can
      include a level of uncertainty (e.g., it can specify the
      "vicinity" of a specific location).  Calendar user agents MAY
      apply their own tolerance to the specified location based on their
      current location value precision.

   Format Definition:  This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   geolocation = "GEO-LOCATION" geolocationparam ":" uri CRLF

   geolocationparam  = *(

                        ; the following is OPTIONAL,
                        ; and MAY occur more than once

                        (";" other-param)

                        )

   Example:  The following is an example of this property:

   GEO-LOCATION:geo:40.443,-79.945;u=10

   TODO Example of VALARM components


10.  Default Alarms in CalDAV

   Users often want to have a default alarm applied to new events that
   they create or to new invitations that arrive on a CalDAV [RFC4791]
   server.  Since this behavior is expected to occur no matter which
   client a user is using, or whether any client is even connected at
   the time, it is beneficial if the server itself is responsible for
   managing the creation of the default alarm.

   This specification defines four new WebDAV properties that can be
   used to specify different sets of default alarms.  Clients can store
   "VALARM" components in these properties to setup the defaults.  When
   a new event or todo is created on the server, the server will
   automatically add the default, as appropriate.  When a new event or
   todo invitation is delivered to the calendar user, the server will
   automatically add the default alarm, as appropriate.

Internet-Draft              VALARM Extensions                   May 2011


   The four new WebDAV properties are:

   CALDAV:default-alarm-vevent-datetime  A default alarm applied to
      "VEVENT" components whose "DTSTART" property value type is "DATE-
      TIME"

   CALDAV:default-alarm-vevent-date  A default alarm applied to "VEVENT"
      components whose "DTSTART" property value type is "DATE"

   CALDAV:default-alarm-vtodo-datetime  A default alarm applied to
      "VTODO" components whose "DUE" or "DTSTART" property value type is
      "DATE-TIME"

   CALDAV:default-alarm-vtodo-date  A default alarm applied to "VTODO"
      components whose "DUE" or "DTSTART" property value type is "DATE",
      or when neither of those properties is present

   The WebDAV properties are defined on a calendar user's "calendar
   home" collection, or on individual calendar collections.  When events
   or tasks are created in a calendar, the server will first inspect the
   WebDAV properties on the calendar collection to see if the
   appropriate property is present.  If it is, the server will use the
   value of that property to set the default in the new component.  If
   the property is not present on the calendar collection, the server
   will determine whether the property is present on the calendar home
   collection that contains the calendar collection.  If present on the
   calendar home, the property value there is used as the default.

   The WebDAV property value MUST be one or more "VALARM" components or
   the empty string.  If an empty string is used, no default alarms are
   applied.  Note that these values contain just the "BEGIN:
   VALARM...END:VALARM" data (i.e., syntactically the "alarmcext"
   element).

   If a "DESCRIPTION" property is present in the "VALARM" component, but
   its value is empty, the server SHOULD insert the value from any
   "SUMMARY" property of the component in which the default "VALARM" is
   being added.


11.  Security Considerations

   TODO:talk about importance of stripping VALARMs from incoming iTIP.
   Talk about VALARMs being used to "spam" - particularly nasty if the
   server handles it.
