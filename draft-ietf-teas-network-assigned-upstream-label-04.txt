Abstract

   This document discusses a Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) Resource reSerVation Protocol with Traffic Engineering (RSVP-
   TE) mechanism that enables the network to assign an upstream label
   for a bidirectional LSP.  This is useful in scenarios where a given
   node does not have sufficient information to assign the correct
   upstream label on its own and needs to rely on the downstream node to
   pick an appropriate label.

1.  Introduction

   The Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Resource
   reSerVation Protocol with Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) extensions
   for setting up a bidirectional LSP are specified in RFC 3473
   [RFC3473].  The bidirectional LSP setup is indicated by the presence
   of an UPSTREAM_LABEL Object in the PATH message.  As per the existing
   setup procedure outlined for a bidirectional LSP, each upstream node
   must allocate a valid upstream label on the outgoing interface before
   sending the initial PATH message downstream.  However, there are
   certain scenarios where it is not desirable or possible for a given
   node to pick the upstream label on its own.  This document defines
   the protocol mechanism to be used in such scenarios.  This mechanism
   enables a given node to offload the task of assigning the upstream
   label for a given bidirectional LSP onto the network.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Use-Case: Wavelength Setup for IP over Optical Networks

   Consider the network topology depicted in Figure 1.  Nodes A and B
   are client IP routers that are connected to an optical WDM transport
   network.  F, H and I represent WDM nodes.  The transponder sits on
   the router and is directly connected to the add-drop port on a WDM
   node.

   The optical signal originating on "Router A" is tuned to a particular
   wavelength.  On "WDM-Node F", it gets multiplexed with optical
   signals at other wavelengths.  Depending on the implementation of
   this multiplexing function, it may not be acceptable to have the
   router send signal into the optical network unless it is at the
   appropriate wavelength.  In other words, having the router send
   signal with a wrong wavelength may adversely impact existing optical
   trails.  If the clients do not have full visibility into the optical
   network, they are not in a position to pick the correct wavelength
   up-front.

3.  The "Crankback Signaling" Approach

   There are currently no GMPLS RSVP-TE protocol mechanisms that an
   upstream node can use for indicating that it does not know what
   upstream label to use and that it needs the downstream node to pick
   the label on its behalf.

   The "Crankback Signaling" RFC 4920 [RFC4920] approach can be applied
   to address the above use-case as shown in the following setup
   sequence:

            PATH

                   Setup Sequence - Crank-back Approach

                                 Figure 2

   The above approach does work, but there are a few obvious concerns:

   o  Since "Router-A" does not know which upstream label to use, it
      picks some random label and signals it without programming its
      data-plane (this is a deviation from the UPSTREAM_LABEL processing
      procedures outlined in RFC 3473 [RFC3473]).  As a result, the
      outgoing PATH message has no indication of whether the upstream
      label has been installed along the data-path or not.

   o  Even if "Router-A" somehow correctly guesses an acceptable
      upstream label upfront, the network may end up finding a path
      which is suboptimal (there could be a different acceptable
      upstream label which corresponds to a better path in the network)

Internet-Draft       Network Assigned Upstream-Label          March 2017


   o  The "PATH-ERR with Acceptable Label Set" retry approach is usually
      used for exception handling.  The above solution uses it for
      almost every single setup request (except in the rare scenario
      where the appropriate upstream label is guessed correctly).

   o  There is an awkward window between the time the network sends out
      the PATH-ERR message (with the ACCEPTABLE_LABEL_SET) and receives
      the corresponding PATH message (with the selected UPSTREAM_LABEL);
      this window opens up the possibility of the selected
      UPSTREAM_LABEL to be stale by the time the network receives the
      retry PATH.

   o  The above solution assumes the use of "symmetric labels" by
      default.

   The rest of the sections in this draft present a solution proposal
   that is devoid of any of the above concerns.

4.  Symmetric Labels

   As per RFC 3471 [RFC3471], the upstream label and the downstream
   label for an LSP at a given hop need not be the same.  The use-case
   discussed in this document pertains to Lambda Switch Capable (LSC)
   LSPs and it is an undocumented fact that in practice, LSC LSPs always
   have symmetric labels at each hop along the path of the LSP.

   The use of the protocol mechanism discussed in this document mandates
   "Label Symmetry".  This mechanism is meant to be used only for
   bidirectional LSPs that assign symmetric labels at each hop along the
   path of the LSP.

5.  Unassigned Upstream Label

   This document proposes the use of a special label value -
   "0xFFFFFFFF" (for a 4-byte label) - to indicate an Unassigned
   Upstream Label.  Similar "all-ones" patterns are expected to be used
   for labels of other sizes.  The presence of this value in the
   UPSTREAM_LABEL object of a PATH message indicates that the upstream
   node has not assigned an upstream label on its own and has requested
   the downstream node to provide a label that it can use in both
   forward and reverse directions.  The presence of this value in the
   UPSTREAM_LABEL object of a PATH message MUST also be interpreted by
   the receiving node as a request to mandate "symmetric labels" for the
   LSP.

5.1.  Processing Rules

   The Unassigned Upstream Label is used by an upstream node when it is
   not in a position to pick the upstream label on its own.  In such a
   scenario, the upstream node sends a PATH message downstream with an
   Unassigned Upstream Label and requests the downstream node to provide
   a symmetric label.  If the upstream node desires to make the
   downstream node aware of its limitations with respect to label
   selection, it MUST specify a list of valid labels via the LABEL_SET
   object as specified in RFC 3473 [RFC3473].

   In response, the downstream node picks an appropriate symmetric label
   and sends it via the LABEL object in the RESV message.  The upstream
   node would then start using this symmetric label for both directions
   of the LSP.  If the downstream node cannot pick the symmetric label,
   it MUST issue a PATH-ERR message with a "Routing Problem/Unacceptable
   Label Value" indication.

   The upstream node will continue to signal the Unassigned Upstream
   Label in the PATH message even after it receives an appropriate
   symmetric label in the RESV message.  This is done to make sure that
   the downstream node would pick a different symmetric label if and
   when it needs to change the label at a later point in time.

5.2.  Backwards Compatibility

   If the downstream node is running an older implementation and doesn't
   understand the semantics of an Unassigned UPSTREAM LABEL, it will
   either (a) reject the special label value and generate an error as

   specified in Section 3.1 of RFC 3473 [RFC3473] or (b) accept it and
   treat it as a valid label.

   If the behavior that is exhibited is (a), then there are obviously no
   backwards compatibility concerns.  If there is some existing
   implementation that exhibits the behavior in (b), then there could be
   some potential issues.  However, at the time of publication, there is
   no documented evidence of any existing implementation that uses the
   "all-ones" bit pattern as a valid label.  Thus, it is safe to assume
   that the behavior in (b) will never be exhibited.

6.  Applicability

   The use-case discussed in Section 2 is revisited to examine how the
   mechanism proposed in this document allows the optical network to
   select and communicate the correct wavelength to its clients.

                                 Figure 4

   Steps:

   o  "Router A" does not have enough information to pick an appropriate
      client wavelength.  It sends a PATH message downstream requesting
      the network to assign an appropriate symmetric label for its use.




Zhang, et al.          Expires September 12, 2017               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       Network Assigned Upstream-Label          March 2017


      Since the client wavelength is unknown, the laser is off at the
      ingress client.

   o  The downstream node (Node F) receives the PATH message, chooses
      the appropriate wavelength values and forwards them in appropriate
      label fields to the egress client ("Router B")

   o  "Router B" receives the PATH message, turns the laser ON and tunes
      it to the appropriate wavelength (received in the UPSTREAM_LABEL/
      LABEL_SET of the PATH) and sends out a RESV message upstream.

   o  The RESV message received by the ingress client carries a valid
      symmetric label in the LABEL object.  "Router A" turns on the
      laser and tunes it to the wavelength specified in the network
      assigned symmetric LABEL.

   For cases where the egress-node relies on RSVP signaling to determine
   exactly when to start using the LSP, this draft recommends
   integrating the above sequence with any of the existing graceful
   setup procedures:

   o  "RESV-CONF" setup procedure (or)

   o  2-step "ADMIN STATUS" based setup procedure ("A" bit set in the
      first step; "A" bit cleared when the LSP is ready for use).

6.2.  Wavelength Change

   After the LSP is set up, the network MAY decide to change the
   wavelength for the given LSP.  This could be for a variety of reasons
   - policy reasons, restoration within the core, preemption etc.

   In such a scenario, if the ingress client receives a changed label
   via the LABEL object in a RESV modify, it MUST retune the laser at
   the ingress to the new wavelength.  Similarly, if the egress client
   receives a changed label via UPSTREAM_LABEL/LABEL_SET in a PATH
   modify, it MUST retune the laser at the egress to the new wavelength.
   If the node receiving the changed label in a PATH/RESV message does
   not find the label acceptable, then the corresponding error
   procedures defined in RFC 3473 [RFC3473] MUST be followed.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no requests for IANA action.

10.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a special label value to be carried in the
   UPSTREAM_LABEL object of a PATH message.  This special label value is
   used to enable the function of requesting network assignment of an
   upstream label.  The changes proposed in this document pertain to the
   semantics of a specific field in an existing RSVP object and the
   corresponding procedures.  Thus, there are no new security
   implications raised by this document and the security considerations
   put together by RFC 3473 [RFC3473] still applies.
