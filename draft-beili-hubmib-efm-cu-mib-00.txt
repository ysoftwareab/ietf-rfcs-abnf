Internet-Draft            EFMCu Interfaces MIB              October 2003


1. Introduction

   New Ethernet like interfaces have been defined in the IEEE 802.3ah
   project Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM). In particular 2BaseTL and
   10PassTS interfaces defined over voice-grade copper pairs have been
   specified. These interfaces, collectively called EFMCu, support
   variable rates and optional PMI aggregation (multi-pair bonding).

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community
   to manage EFMCu interfaces.

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 .

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3. Relation to Interfaces MIB

   This section specifies how the ifStackTable, as defined in [RFC2863]
   and ifInvStackTable, as defined in [RFC2864] are used for the EFMCu
   application.

3.1 Layering Model

   An EFMCu interface can aggregate up to 32 PMDs (modems) using so
   called PMI Aggregation Function (PAF).

   An generic EFMCu device can have a number of MII/PCS ports
   cross-connected to a number of PMDs, with a single PCS per PMD
   relationship.

   Each PMD comprising an aggregated EFMCu port is represented in the
   Interface table as a separate port with ifType of shdsl (169) for
   2BaseTL or vdsl(97) for 10PassTS. The ifType values are defined in
   IANAifType-MIB. ifSpeed for each PMD shall return an actual bitrate
   of the active PMD or a configured bitrate for pre-activated modems
   (note that unassigned PMD has its default bitrate).

Internet-Draft            EFMCu Interfaces MIB              October 2003


   The ifStackTable is indexed by the ifIndex values of the aggregated
   EFMCu port (PCS) and the PMDs connected to it. ifStackTable allows a
   Network Management application to determine which PMDs are connected
   to a particular PCS and change connections. The ifInvStackTable,
   being an inverted version of the ifStackTable, provides an efficient
   means for a Network Management application to read a subset of the
   ifStackTable and thereby determine which PCS runs on top of a
   particular PMD.

   A new table efmCuAvailableStackTable defined in this MIB, specifies
   for each PCS a list of PMDs, which can possibly be cross-connected to
   that PCS, determined by the cross-connect capability of the device.
   This table, modeled after ifStackTable, is read only.

   Editor's Note: An alternative would be to use ifStackTable to
   describe cross-connect capability and efmCuAvailableStackTable to
   describe actual connections, so that the cross-connect action would
   be done in the EFM-CU-MIB by modifying the efmCuAvailableStackTable
   (and not in IF-MIB).

3.2 PMI Aggregation Function (PAF)

   aPAFSupported is mandatory for all EFMCu ports (2BASE-TL and
   10PASS-TS).

3.3 Discovery Operation

   This MIB allows a Network Management application to control EFM
   Discovery mechanism and query its results. Note that the Discovery
   mechanism can work only if PAF is supported and enabled.

   Two tables are used by Discovery mechanism: ifStackTable and
   efmCuAvailableStackTable defined. The following pseudo-code defines
   an example of Discovery for a generic PAF enabled multi-PCS EFMCu
   device, located at Central Office (CO):

     foreach PCS[i] in Device
     { if ( PCS[i].PAFSupported ) // Discover only on ports supporting  PAF
         { dc = PCS[i].DiscoveryCode = MAC[i]; // unique 6 byte code per PCS
           // go over all currently disconnected PMDs, which can
   	// pottentially be connected to PCS[i]
           foreach PMD[j] in efmCuAvailableStackTable[PCS[i]] and
                          not in ifStackTable[PCS[i]]
             { PMD[j].RemoteDiscoveryCode = dc;	// Set if Clear
               r = PMD[j].RemoteDiscoveryCode;	// Get
               if ( r == dc )
                 { // Remote CPE connected via PMD[j] is/was a peer for
   	        // PCS[i]. Connect this PMD to the PCS
                   Add PMD[j] to ifStackTable[PCS[i]];
                   // Discover all other currently disconnected PMDs,
                   // attached to the same CPE and connect them to the PCS
                   foreach PMD[k] in efmCuAvailableStackTable[PCS[i]] and
                                  not in ifStackTable[PCS[i]]
                     { r = PMD[k].RemoteDiscoveryCode;	// Get
                       if ( r == dc )
                         Add PMD[k] to ifStackTable[PCS[i]];
                     }
                 }
               // Discovered all PMDs which lead to the same CPE and
               // connected them to PCS[i]. Go to the next PCS.
               break;
             }
         }
     }

   The SNMP Agent builds efmCuStackTable according to the information
   contained in the Clause 45 PMI_Available_register (see [802.3ah]
   61.1.5.3 and 45.2.3.20).

   Adding a PMD to the ifStackTable row for a specific PCS involve
   actual connection of the PCS and PMD, which can be done by modifying
   Clause 45 PMI_Aggregate_register (see [802.3ah] 61.1.5.3 and
   45.2.3.21).

3.4 Relation to SHDSL MIB

   PMD(s) comprising a 2BaseTL port are described in
   HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB . Note that HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB describes
   standard G.SHDSL modems according to ITU-T G.991.2, while IEEE
   802.3ah uses so called G.SHDSL.bis spec, extended to support higher
   constellations and rates. In cases where G.SHDSL and 802.3ah differ,
   the definitions in 802.3ah take precedence.

Internet-Draft            EFMCu Interfaces MIB              October 2003


3.5 Relation to VDSL MIB

   PMD(s) comprising a 10PassTS port are described in VDSL-LINE-MIB
   [draft-ietf-adslmib-vdsl]. In cases where VDSL-LINE-MIB and 802.3ah
   differ, the definitions in 802.3ah take precedence

3.6 Relation to Ethernet-Like and MAU MIBs

   EFMCu interfaces require implementation of ETHERIF-MIB
   [draft-ietf-hubmib-etherif-mib] and MAU-MIB [RFC3636]. As such EFMCu
   interfaces 2BaseTL/10PassTS shall return an ifType of
   ethernetCsmacd(6). Information on the particular flavor of EFMCu that
   an interface is running is available from ifSpeed in the Interfaces
   Group MIB [RFC2863], and ifMauType in the MAU MIB [RFC3636].

3.7 Mapping of IEEE 802.3ah Managed Objects

   This section contains the mapping between oMAU managed objects
   defined in [802.3ah] and managed objects defined in this document and
   in associated MIB modules, i.e., the IF-MIB [RFC2863], the
   HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB , and the MAU-MIB [RFC3636].

             to run on top of the PMD with ifIndex value y, then this table
             contains:

               efmCuAvailableStackStatus.x.y=active

             For each ifIndex value, I, which identifies a PCS or PMD
             interface, there are always at least two instantiated rows
             in this table associated with I.  For one of these rows, I
             is the value of efmCuAvailableStackHigherLayer; for the other,
   	  I is the value of efmCuAvailableStackLowerLayer.
             Note that there's always at least on PCS for each PMD and at
             least one PMD for each PCS in the EFMCu devices.
             This table is ready only as it describes device capability"

5. Security Considerations

   There are number of managed objects defined in this MIB module that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write. Most objects are writeable
   only when the link is Down. Writing to these objects can have the
   following potentially disruptive effects on network operation:
   o  TBD

   The user of this MIB module must therefore be aware that support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection
   can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with MAX-ACCESS
   other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in some
   environments since, collectively, they provide information about the
   performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.  In such environments it is important to control
   even GET and NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly even to
   encrypt their values when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even
   then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed

   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
