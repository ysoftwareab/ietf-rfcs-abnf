Abstract

   EAP-TLS [RFC5216] is being updated for TLS 1.3 in [EAPTLS].  Many
   other EAP [RFC3748] and [RFC5247] types also depend on TLS, such as
   FAST [RFC4851], TTLS [RFC5281], TEAP [RFC7170], and possibly many
   vendor specific EAP methods.  This document updates those methods in
   order to use the new key derivation methods available in TLS 1.3.
   Additional changes necessitated by TLS 1.3 are also discussed.

1.  Introduction

   EAP-TLS is being updated for TLS 1.3 in [EAPTLS].  Many other EAP
   types also depend on TLS, such as FAST [RFC4851], TTLS [RFC5281],
   TEAP [RFC7170], and possibly many vendor specific EAP methods such as
   PEAP [PEAP].  All of these methods use key derivation functions which
   are no longer applicable to TLS 1.3.  As such, all of those methods
   are incompatible with TLS 1.3.

   We wish to enable the use of TLS 1.3 in the wider Internet community.
   As such, it is necessary to update the above EAP Types.  These
   changes involve defining new key derivation functions.  We also
   discuss implementation issues in order to highlight differences
   between TLS 1.3 and earlier versions of TLS.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Using TLS-based EAP methods with TLS 1.3

   In general, all of the requirements of [EAPTLS] apply to other EAP
   methods that wish to use TLS 1.3.  Unless otherwise required herein,
   implementations of EAP methods that wish to use TLS 1.3 MUST follow
   the guidelines in [EAPTLS].

   There remain some differences between EAP-TLS and other TLS-based EAP
   methods which necessitates this document.  The main difference is
   that [EAPTLS] uses the EAP-TLS Type (value 0x0D) in a number of
   calculations, whereas other method types will use their own Type
   value instead of the EAP-TLS Type value.  This topic is discussed
   further below in Section 2.

   An additional difference is that the [EAPTLS] Section 2.5 requires
   that once the EAP-TLS handshake has completed, the EAP server sends a
   protected success result indication.  This indication is composed of
   one octet (0x00) of application data.  Other TLS-based EAP methods
   also use this indicator, but only during resumption.  When the other
   TLS-based EAP methods use full authentication, the indicator is not
   needed, and is not used.  This topic is explained in more detail
   below, in Section 3.

   Finally, the document includes clarifications on how various TLS-
   based parameters are calculated when using TLS 1.3.  These parameters
   are different for each EAP method, so they are discussed separately.

2.1.  Key Derivation

   The key derivation for TLS-based EAP methods depends on the value of
   the EAP Type as defined by [IANA] in the Extensible Authentication
   Protocol (EAP) Registry.  The most important definition is of the
   Type field, as first defined in [RFC3748] Section 2:

      Type = value of the EAP Method type

   For the purposes of this specification, when we refer to logical
   Type, we mean that the logical Type is defined to be 1 octet for
   values smaller than 254 (the value for the Expanded Type), and when
   Expanded EAP Types are used, the logical Type is defined to be the
   concatetation of the fields required to define the Expanded Type,
   including the Type with value 0xfe, Vendor-Id (in network byte order)
   and Vendor-Type fields (in network byte order) defined in [RFC3748]
   Section 5.7.

      Type = 0xFE || Vendor-Id || Vendor-Type

   This definition does not alter the meaning of Type in [RFC3748], or



DeKok, Alan                 Proposed Standard                   [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT       TLS-based EAP types and TLS 1.3        22 June 2021


   change the structure of EAP packets.  Instead, this definition allows
   us to simplify references to EAP Types, by just using a logical
   "Type" instead of referring to "the Type field or the Type field with
   value 0xfe, plus the Vendor-ID and Vendor-Type".

   Unless otherwise discussed below, the key derivation functions for
   all TLS-based EAP Types are defined as follows:

      Key_Material = TLS-Exporter("EXPORTER_EAP_TLS_Key_Material",
                                   Type, 128)
      Method-Id    = TLS-Exporter("EXPORTER_EAP_TLS_Method-Id",
                                   Type, 64)
      Session-Id   = Type || Method-Id
      MSK          = Key_Material(0, 63)
      EMSK         = Key_Material(64, 127)

   We note that these definitions re-use the EAP-TLS exporter labels,
   and change the derivation only by adding a dependency on the logical
   Type.  The reason for this change is simplicity.  There does not
   appear to be compelling reasons to make the labels method-specific,
   when they can just include the logical Type in the key derivation.

   These definitions apply in their entirety to TTLS [RFC5281] and PEAP
   as defined in [PEAP] and [MSPEAP].  Some definitions apply to FAST
   and TEAP, with exceptions as noted below.

   It is RECOMMENDED that vendor-defined TLS-based EAP methods use the
   above definitions for TLS 1.3.  There is no compelling reason to use
   different definitions.

2.2.  TEAP

   [RFC7170] Section 5.2 gives a definition for the Inner Method Session
   Key (IMSK), which depends on the TLS-PRF.  We update that definition
   for TLS 1.3 as:

      IMSK = TLS-Exporter("TEAPbindkey@ietf.org", EMSK, 32)

   For MSK and EMSK, TEAP [RFC7170] uses an inner tunnel EMSK to
   calculate the outer EMSK.  As such, those key derivations cannot use
   the above derivation.

   The other key derivations for TEAP are given here.  All derivations
   not given here are the same as given above in the previous section.
   These derivations are also used for FAST, but using the FAST Type.

      session_key_seed = TLS-Exporter("EXPORTER: session key seed",
                                      Type, 40)

INTERNET-DRAFT       TLS-based EAP types and TLS 1.3        22 June 2021


      S-IMCK[0] = session_key_seed
        For j = 1 to n-1 do
          IMCK[j] = TLS-Exporter("EXPORTER: Inner Methods Compound Keys",
                                 S-IMCK[j-1] | IMSK[j], 60)
          S-IMCK[j] = first 40 octets of IMCK[j]
          CMK[j] = last 20 octets of IMCK[j]

   Where | denotes concatenation.  MSK and EMSK are then derived from
   the above definitions, as:

      MSK  = TLS-Exporter("EXPORTER: Session Key Generating Function",
                           S-IMCK[j], 64)

      EMSK = TLS-Exporter("EXPORTER: Extended Session Key Generating Function",
                           S-IMCK[j], 64)

   The TEAP Compound MAC defined in [RFC7170] Section 5.3 is updated to
   use the definition of CMK[j] given above, which then leads to the
   following definition

      CMK = CMK[j]

      Compound-MAC = MAC( CMK, BUFFER )

   where j is the number of the last successfully executed inner EAP
   method.  For TLS 1.3, the hash function used is the same as the
   ciphersuite hash function negotiated for HKDF in the key schedule, as
   per section 7.1 of RFC 8446.  The definition of BUFFER is unchanged
   from [RFC7170] Section 5.3

2.3.  FAST

   For FAST, the session_key_seed is also used as the key_block, as
   defined in [RFC4851] Section 5.1.

   The definition of S-IMCK[n], MSK, and EMSK are the same as given
   above for TEAP.  We reiterate that the EAP-FAST Type must be used
   when deriving the session_key_seed, and not the TEAP Type.

   Unlike [RFC4851] Section 5.2, the definition of IMCK[j] places the
   reference to S-IMCK after the textual label, and the concatenates the
   IMSK instead of MSK.

   EAP-FAST previously used a PAC, which is a type of pre-shared key
   (PSK).  Such uses are deprecated in TLS 1.3.  As such, PAC
   provisioning is no longer part of EAP-FAST when TLS 1.3 is used.

   The T-PRF given in [RFC4851] Section 5.5 is not used for TLS 1.3.

INTERNET-DRAFT       TLS-based EAP types and TLS 1.3        22 June 2021


2.4.  TTLS

   [RFC5281] Section 11.1 defines an implicit challenge when the inner
   methods of CHAP [RFC1994], MS-CHAP [RFC2433], or MS-CHAPv2 [RFC2759]
   are used.  The derivation for TLS 1.3 is instead given as

   EAP-TTLS_challenge = TLS-Exporter("ttls challenge",, n)

   There no "context_value" ([RFC8446] Section 7.5) passed to the TLS-
   Exporter function.  The value "n" given here is the length of the
   challenge required, which [RFC5281] requires to be either 8 or 16
   octets, depending on the challenge being used.

   Note that unlike TLS 1.2 and earlier, the calculation of TLS-Exporter
   depends on the length passed to it.  Implementations therefore MUST
   pass the correct length, instead of passing a large length and
   truncating the output.  Any output calculated using a longer length
   which is then truncated, will be different from the output calculated
   using the correct length.

2.5.  PEAP

   When PEAP uses crypto binding, it uses a different key calculation
   defined in [PEAP-MPPE] which consumes inner method keying material.
   The pseudo-random function (PRF) used here is not taken from the TLS
   exporter, but is instead calculated via a different method which is
   given in [PEAP-PRF].  That derivation remains unchanged in this
   specification.

   However, the key calculation uses a PEAP Tunnel Key [PEAP-TK] which
   is defined as:

       ... the TK is the first 60 octets of the Key_Material, as
      specified in [RFC5216]: TLS-PRF-128 (master secret, "client EAP
      encryption", client.random || server.random).

   We note that this text does not define Key_Material.  Instead, it
   defines TK as the first octets of Key_Material, and gives a
   definition of Key_Material which is appropriate for TLS versions
   before TLS 1.3.

   For TLS 1.3, the TK should be derived from the Key_Material defined
   above in Section 2.1, instead of using the TLS-PRF-128 derivation
   given above.

3.  Application Data

   Unlike previous TLS versions, TLS 1.3 can continue negotiation after
   the initial TLS handshake has been completed, which TLS 1.3 calls the
   "CONNECTED" state.  Some implementations use a "TLS finished"
   determination as an indication that TLS negotiation has completed,
   and that an "inner tunnel" session can now be negotiated.  This
   assumption is no longer correct for TLS 1.3.

   TLS 1.3 permits NewSessionTicket messages to be sent before the TLS
   "Finished", and after application data is sent.  This change can
   cause many implementations to fail in a number of different ways.

   In order to correct this failure, we require that if the underlying
   TLS connection is still performing negotiation, then implementations
   MUST NOT send, or expect to receive application data in the TLS
   session.  Implementations MUST delay processing of application data
   until such time as the TLS negotiation has finished.  If the TLS
   negotiation is successful, then the application data can be examined.
   If the TLS negotiation is unsuccessful, then the application data is
   untrusted, and therefore MUST be discarded without being examined.

   The default for many TLS library implementations is to send a
   NewSessionTicket message immediately after, or along with, the TLS
   Finished message.  This ticket is could be used for resumption, even
   if the "inner tunnel" authentication has not been completed.  If the
   ticket could be used, then it could allow a malicious EAP peer to
   completely bypass the "inner tunnel" authentication

   Therefore, the EAP server MUST NOT permit any session ticket to
   successfully resume authentication, unless the inner tunnel
   authentication has completed successfully.

   To protect against that attack, implementations SHOULD NOT send
   NewSessionTicket messages until the "inner tunnel" authentication has
   completed.  There is no reason to send session tickets which will
   later be invalidated or ignored.  However, we recognize that this
   suggestion may not always be possible to implement with some
   available TLS libraries.  As such, EAP server MUST take care to
   either invalidate or discard session tickets which are associated
   with sessions that terminate in EAP Failure.

   The NewSessionTicketMessage SHOULD also be sent along with other
   application data, if possible.  Sending that message alone bloats the
   packet exchange to no benefit.

   [EAPTLS] Section 2.5 requires a protected result indicator which
   indicates that TLS negotiation has finished.  Methods which use



DeKok, Alan                 Proposed Standard                   [Page 9]

INTERNET-DRAFT       TLS-based EAP types and TLS 1.3        22 June 2021


   "inner tunnel" methods MUST instead begin their "inner tunnel"
   negotiation by sending Type-specific application data.

4.  Resumption

   [EAPTLS] Section 2.1.3 defines the process for resumption.  This
   process is the same for all TLS-based EAP types.  The only practical
   difference is that the value of the Type field is different.

   All TLS-based EAP methods support resumption, as it is a property of
   the underlying TLS protocol.  All EAP servers and peers MUST support
   resumption for all TLS-based EAP methods.  We note that EAP servers
   and peers can still choose to not resume any particular session.  For
   example, EAP servers may forbid resumption for administrative, or
   other policy reasons.

   It is RECOMMENDED that EAP servers and peers enable resumption, and
   use it where possible.  The use of resumption decreases the number of
   round trips used for authentication.  This decrease leads to lower
   latency for authentications, and less load on the EAP server.
   Resumption can also lower load on external systems, such as databases
   which contain user credentials.

   As the packet flows for resumption are essentially identical across
   all TLS-based EAP types, it is technically possible to authenticate
   using EAP-TLS (Type 13), and then perform resumption using another
   EAP type, just as EAP-TTLS (Type 21).  However, there is no practical
   benefit to doing so.  It is also not clear what this behavior would
   mean, or what (if any) security issues there may be with it.  As a
   result, this behavior is forbidden.

   EAP servers therefore MUST NOT resume sessions across different EAP
   Types, and EAP servers MUST reject resumptions in which the EAP Type
   value is different from the original authentication.

5.  Security Considerations

   [EAPTLS] Section 5 is included here by reference.

   Updating the above EAP methods to use TLS 1.3 is of high importance
   for the Internet Community.  Using the most recent security protocols
   can significantly improve security and privace of a network.

   In some cases, client certificates are not used for TLS-based EAP
   methods.  In those cases, the user is authenticated only after
   successful completion of the inner tunnel authentication.  However,
   the TLS protocol may send one or more NewSessionTicket after
   receiving the TLS Finished message from the client, and therefore



DeKok, Alan                 Proposed Standard                  [Page 10]

INTERNET-DRAFT       TLS-based EAP types and TLS 1.3        22 June 2021


   before the user is authenticated.

   This separation of data allows for a "time of use, time of check"
   security issue.  Malicious clients can begin a session and receive a
   NewSessionTicket.  The malicious client can then abort the
   authentication session, and the obtained NewSessionTicket to "resume"
   the previous session.

   As a result, EAP servers MUST NOT permit sessions to be resumed until
   after authentication has successfully completed.  This requirement
   may be met in a number of ways.  For example, by not caching the
   session ticket until after authentication has completed, or by
   marking up the cached session ticket with a flag stating whether or
   not authentication has completed.

   For PEAP, some derivation use HMAC-SHA1 [PEAP-MPPE].  There are no
   known security issues with HMAC-SHA1.  In the interests of
   interoperability and minimal changes, we do not change that
   deriviation.

5.1.  Protected Success and Failure indicators

   [EAPTLS] provides for protected success and failure indicators as
   discussed in Section 4.1.1 of [RFC4137].  These indicators are
   provided for both full authentication, and for resumption.

   Other TLS-based EAP methods provide these indicators only for
   resumption.

   For full authenticaton, the other TLS-based EAP methods do not
   provide for protected success and failure indicators as part of the
   outer TLS exchange.  That is, the protected result indicator is not
   used, and there is no TLS-layer alert sent when the inner
   authentication fails.  Instead, there is simply either an EAP-Success
   or EAP-Failure sent.  This behavior is the same as for previous TLS
   versions, and therefore introduces no new security issues.

   We note that most TLS-based EAP methods provide for success and
   failure indicators as part of the authentication exchange performed
   inside of the TLS tunnel.  These indicators are therefore protected,
   as they cannot be modified or forged.

   However, some inner methods do not provide for success or failure
   indicators.  For example, the use of TTLS with inner PAP or CHAP.
   Those methods send authentication credentials to the server via the
   inner tunnel, with no possibility to similarly signal success or
   failure inside of the tunnel.




DeKok, Alan                 Proposed Standard                  [Page 11]

INTERNET-DRAFT       TLS-based EAP types and TLS 1.3        22 June 2021


   There are functionally equivalent authentication methods which can be
   used to replace the methods which are missing protected indicators.
   PAP can often be replaced with EAP-GTC, and CHAP with EAP-MD5.  Both
   replacement methods provide for similar functionality, and have
   protected success and failure indicator.  The main cost to this
   change is additional round trips.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations deprecate inner tunnel methods
   which do not provided protected success and failure indicators.
   Implementations SHOULD use EAP-GTC instead of PAP, and EAP-MD5
   instead of CHAP.  New TLS-based EAP methods MUST provide protected
   success and failure indicators inside of the TLS tunnel.

   When the inner authentication protocol indicates that authentication
   has failed, then implementations MUST fail authentication for the
   entire session.  There MAY be additional protocol exchanges in order
   to exchange more detailed failure indicators, but the final result
   MUST be a failed authentication.  As noted earlier, any session
   tickets for this failed authentication MUST be either invalidated or
   discarded.

   Similarly, when the inner authentication protocol indicates that
   authentication has succeeed, then implementations SHOULD cause
   authentication to succeed for the entire session.  There MAY be
   additional protocol exchanges in order which could cause other
   failures, so success is not required here.

   In both of these cases, the EAP server MUST send an EAP-Failure or
   EAP-Success message, as indicated by Section 2, item 4 of [RFC3748].
   Even though both parties have already determined the final
   authentication status, the full EAP state machine must still be
   followed.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the TLS-
   based EAP methods for TLS 1.3 protocol in accordance with [RFC8126].

   This memo requires IANA to add the following labels to the TLS
   Exporter Label Registry defined by [RFC5705].  These labels are used
   in the derivation of Key_Material and Method-Id as defined above in
   Section 2.

   The labels below need to be added to the "TLS Exporter Labels"
   registry.  These labels are used only for TEAP.
