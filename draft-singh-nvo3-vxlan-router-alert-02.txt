                       VxLAN Router Alert Option
                 draft-singh-nvo3-vxlan-router-alert-02

Abstract

   This proposal describes a new option to achieve a mechanism which
   alerts VxLAN terminating VTEP to more closely examine the contents of
   the packet encapsulated under VxLAN header.  This option is useful
   for case(s) where a given frame encapsulated within a given VXLAN
   segment responsible for carrying data between two different End
   Systems contains some control information (e.g OAM information, any
   control plane protocol packet etc.) that may require special
   handling/processing by terminating VTEP.

2.  Introduction

   VXLAN [RFC7348]is a tunneling mechanism to overlay Layer 2 networks
   on top of Layer 3 networks.  In most cases the end point of the
   tunnel (VTEP) is intended to be at the edge of the network, typically
   connecting an access switch to an IP transport network.  The access
   switch could be a physical or a virtual switch located within the
   hypervisor on the server which is connected to End System which is a
   VM.

   VXLAN segment encapsulates End System data at Originating VTEP and
   carries it over L3 network to the Terminating VTEP, where VXLAN
   header is interpreted, removed and data is passed on to the End
   System.

   There could be some scenarios, where the network element at
   originating VTEP needs to encapsulate some control information in a
   given VXLAN segment, and this control information needs to be
   analysed and processed at the terminating VTEP for that VXLAN
   segment.  There could be various examples of such control information
   e.g OAM, and protocol control packets encapsulated in VxLAN segment.

   This document defines a mechanism whereby Originating VTEP can add
   additional information to the VXLAN header, based upon which the
   Terminating VTEP can decide to analyse the payload under VXLAN packet
   and handle it to slow-path, rather then forwarding it to the
   destination End System.

3.  Terminology

   Terminology used in this document:

   VXLAN: Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network.

   VTEP: VXLAN Tunnel End Point.

   VM: Virtual Machine.

   End System: Could be VM etc. - System whose data is expected to go
   over VXLAN Segment.

   OAM: Operations, Administration, and Maintenance

   Other terminologies are as defined in [RFC7348].

4.  Approach

   If the Originating VTEP decides to generate control information,
   which needs to go over a given VXLAN segment and if the Terminating
   VTEP needs to analyse and process it, then following procedures have
   to be followed at Originating and Terminating VTEP(s):-

4.1.  Originating VTEP Procedure

   When creating the VXLAN header for a given VXLAN segment, the
   Originating VTEP MUST set Router Alert Bit in the Flag bits in VXLAN
   header.  The VNI for this frame MUST be the same as for the given
   VXLAN segment which carries the data traffic of the End System.


       VXLAN Header:
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |R|R|R|R|I|R|R|RA|           Reserved                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) |   Reserved    |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

       RA: Router Alert Bit (Proposed)

4.2.  Terminating VTEP Procedure

   On receiving VXLAN frame, the Terminating VTEP would do the usual
   VXLAN processing as defined in [RFC7348], but if the RA Bit in Flags
   is Set it MUST send the rest of the inner frame for further
   processing to the above application.  The details of the applications
   and how it would process the inner frame is outside the scope of this
   document.  This frame MUST not be sent to the target End System.

6.  Security Considerations

   For wide range, security requirements for VxLAN Packets with Route
   Alert (RA) bit set is no different from how IP Router Alert Option is
   handled in Network End Points.

   The most common potential attack could be Denial-of-Service attacks
   by sending VxLAN Packets with Router Alert Bit Set at aggressive
   rate, causing potential high resource utilization.  For such
   scenarios its recommended that implementations regulate sending of
   such packets to control plane via rate limiting.
