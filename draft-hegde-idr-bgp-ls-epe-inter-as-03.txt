      BGP-LS Extensions for Inter-AS TE using EPE based mechanisms
                 draft-hegde-idr-bgp-ls-epe-inter-as-03

Abstract

   In certain network deployments, a single operator has multiple
   Autonomous Systems(AS) to facilitate ease of management.  A multiple
   AS network design could also be a result of network mergers and
   acquisitions.  In such scenarios, a centralized Inter-domain TE
   approach could provide most optimal allocation of resources and the
   most controlled path placement.  BGP-LS-EPE
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe] describes an extension to
   BGP Link State (BGP-LS) for the advertisement of BGP Peering Segments
   along with their BGP peering node and inter-AS link information, so
   that efficient BGP Egress Peer Engineering (EPE) policies and
   strategies can be computed based on Segment Routing.  This document
   describes extensions to the BGP-LS EPE to enable it to be used for
   inter-AS Traffic-Engineering (TE) purposes.

1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages source routing.  A node steers a
   packet through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by
   prepending the packet with an SR header with segment identifiers
   (SID).  A SID can represent any instruction, topological or service-
   based.  SR segments allows to enforce a flow through any topological
   path or service function while maintaining per-flow state only at the
   ingress node of the SR domain.

   As there is no per-path state in the network, the bandwidth
   management for the paths is expected to be handled by a centralized
   entity which has a complete view of:

Internet-Draft BGP-LS extensions for Inter-AS TE using EPE     June 2020


      1.  Up-to-date topology of the network

      2.  Resources, States and Attributes of links and nodes of the
      network

      3.  Run-time utilization/availability of resources

   The BGP Link-State extensions provide mechanisms whereby link-state
   and TE information can be propagated n a network and a consumer of
   such BGP LS updates may build topology, provide bandwidth calendering
   and other traffic engineering services.  The centralized entity can
   be such a consumer (also referred to as controller).  In the case of
   multi-AS networks, the controller needs to learn the per-AS network
   information and the inter-AS link information thus arriving at a
   consolidated Traffic Engineering Database which can be used to
   compute end-to-end Traffic Engineering Path.  The controller can
   learn the topology, link-state and TE information from each of the AS
   networks either by participating in their IGPs or by listening to BGP
   LS updates [RFC7752].  Similar information about the inter-AS links
   can be learnt via BGP-LS EPE [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe]
   along with extensions defined in this documet.

2.  Reference Topology

   The controller learns TE attributes of all the links, including the
   inter-AS links and uses the attributes to compute constrained paths.
   The controller should be able to correlate the inter-AS links for
   bidirectional connectivity from both ASes.

                        Figure 1: Reference Diagram

   The reference diagram from
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-central-epe] represents multiple
   Autonomous Systems connected to each other.  When the Multiple ASes
   belong to same operator and are organised into separate domains for
   operational purposes, it is advantageous to support Traffic-
   Engineering across the ASes including the inter-AS links.  The
   controller has visibility of all of the ASes by means of IGP topology
   exported via BGP-LS [RFC7752], or other means.  In addition, the
   inter-AS links and the labels associated with the inter-AS links are
   exported via [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe].  The
   controller needs to correlate the information acquired from all of
   the ASes, including the inter-AS links in order to get a view of the
   unified topology so that it can build end-to-end Traffic-Engineered
   paths.

3.  Fast Reroute Label

   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-central-epe] section 3.6 describes
   mechanisms to provide Fast Reroute (FRR) protection for the EPE
   Labels.  The BGP-LS EPE [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe]
   describes "B" bit to indicate that a PeerNodeSID or PeerAdjSID is
   eligible for backup.  However, it does not specify what is the
   behaviour when the failure kicks-in.  The controller needs to know
   which links are used for protection so that admission control and
   failure simulation can be done effectively and appropriate inter-AS
   links used for path construction.

   This document defines a new flag "F" in the Peering SIDs TLV to
   indicate a SID as an FRR SID.  With the "F" flag set, the protection
   for any peering SID can be specified using another PeerAdjSID,
   PeerNodeSID or PeerSetSID to the controller.  If the protection is
   achieved by fallback to local IP lookup, FRR SID SHOULD not be
   advertised.  The link(s) represented by the FRR SID will carry the
   traffic when there is a failure.  These SIDs are included as an FRR
   SIDs in the peerAdjSID, PeerNodeSID and PeerSetSID advertisements.

   * F-Flag: FRR Label Flag: If set, the peer SID where the FRR Label
   appears is using backup links represented by FRR Label.

4.  TE Link attributes of PeerNode SID

   In any eBGP deployment, the peering session can be either single-hop
   of multi-hop.  For single-hop eBGP sessions, the peering address is
   that of the directly attached interface to which the session is
   pinned down.  For multi-hop eBGP session, the peering adress is
   reachable over more than one interface and that the peering session
   is not pinned down to any of the directly attached interfaces.

   A Peer Node Segment is a segment describing a peer, including the SID
   (PeerNodeSID) allocated to it.  The link descriptors for the
   PeerNodeSID include the addresses used by the BGP session encoded
   using TLVs as defined in [RFC7752].  Since the eBGP session can be
   either single-hop or multi-hop, the IP address used by BGP session as
   local/neigbour is not sufficient to identify the underlaying
   interface(s).  Also, the controller needs to know the links
   associated with the PeerNodeSID, to be able derive TE link
   attributes.  This can be achieved by including the interface local
   and remote addresses in the Link attributes in PeerNodeSID NLRI.
   This document defines a new link attribute TLV name Interface Address
   TLV.  PeerNodeSID NLRI MAY optionally include Interface Address TLV.

5.  TE Link attributes of PeerAdj SID

   PeerAdjSID MUST be advertised for each inter-AS link for the purposes
   of inter-AS TE.  The PeerAdjSID should contain link TE attributes
   such as bandwidth, admin-group etc.  The PeerAdjSID should also



Hegde, et al.           Expires December 4, 2020                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft BGP-LS extensions for Inter-AS TE using EPE     June 2020


   contain the local and remote interface IPv4/IPv6 addresses which is
   used for correlating the links.  PeerNodeSID SHOULD contain the
   additional attribute of link local address which is used by the
   controller to find corresponding PeerAdjSID and hence the
   corresponding link TE attributes.

   A peerAdj segment carries mandatory link descriptors as local and
   remote link id.  Remote link id of the neighboring ASBR is not
   readily available.  [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe] suggests
   to carry the value '0' for the remote link id.  The Controller needs
   to associate the links in both directions to effectively handle
   failure notifications and for this purpose a unque remote link is
   necessary.  The remote link ID cannot be manually configured on the
   router as the link-ids generally change over router reboot etc and
   hence manual configuration is operationally very difficult to manage.
   This document mandates advertisement of local and remote iterface
   addresses for the inetr-AS TE purposes.

   The Unnumbered interface is not in the scope of this document.

   Number of IPv4 interface pairs:

   Number of IPv6 interface pairs:

   There may be a number of parallel interfaces and few or all of them
   may be used for the PeerNodeSID.  These interfaces may have both IPV4
   and IPV6 address or some interfaces may be IPv4 only and some IPv6
   only.  The total number of IPv4 and IPv6 interface address count is
   carried seperately in above fields.

   Local Interface Address :

   The interface local address ipv4/ipv6 which corresponds to the
   PeerNodeSID MUST be specified.  For IPv4,this field is 4 octets; for
   IPv6, this field is 16 octets.

   Remote Interface Address :

   The interface remote address ipv4/ipv6 which corresponds to the
   PeerNodeSID MUST be specified.  For IPv4,this field is 4 octets; for
   IPv6, this field is 16 octets.

   There can be multiple Layer 3 interfaces on which a peerNodeSId
   loadbalances the traffic.  All such interfaces local/remote address
   MUST be included when a Link address TLV is added.When a single Layer
   3 interface consists of multiple addresses or when a link has both
   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses configured, It is sufficient to include one
   such pair (either IPV4 or IPv6)address for the PeerNodeSID
   advertisement.  When a PeerNodeSID load-balances over few interfaces
   with IPv4 only address and few interfaces with IPv6 address then the
   Link address TLV should list all IPv4 address pairs together followed
   by IPv6 address pairs.

7.  Example Advertisements

   The below diagram represents two ASBR routers and inter-AS links
   between them.  The inter-AS links could be connected via switches L1
   and L2 as shown in the diagram or via Point-to-point links A2->B2,
   A3->B3 as shown in the diagram below.  In the below example, lets
   assume peerNodeSID 1 is configured to use peerAdjSID 10002 then
   PeerNodeSID 1 will have the B bit set which means the PeerNodeSID 1
   is eligible for backup.  Label 10002 is added to the PeerNodeSID with
   a "F" bit set, which means 10002 is a backup for PeerNodeSID 1.
