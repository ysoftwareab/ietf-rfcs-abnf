   Resource Record (RR)  A set of attributes bound to a Domain Name.

   Relying Party  A party that makes use of an application whose
      operation depends on use of a Certificate or Key for making a

   Relying Application  An application whose operation depends on use of
      a Certificate or Key for making a security decision.


2.  Use Cases

   TBS


3.  Constraints

3.1.  [C-Legacy-Browser]

   The legacy base of browsers does not support hard fail when an OCSP
   responder is unavailable

3.2.  [C-Legacy-Server]

   The legacy base of servers does not support OCSP stapling

3.3.  [C-Legacy-DNS]

   The legacy DNS does not provide for cryptographic authentication of
   responses


4.  Requirements

4.1.  [R-Fraud]

   Prevent clients relying on mis-issued or fraudulently issued
   certificates

4.2.  [R-Comp]

   Prevent clients relying on certificates that were legitimately issued
   but have since been compromised (e.g. subject key is compromised)


5.  Metrics

Internet-Draft    Options for Improving PKIX Revocation       April 2011


5.1.  [M-Client-Efficiency]

   Time spent checking certificate status in the browser

5.2.  [M-Server-Admin]

   Complexity of server operations.


6.  Proposals

6.1.  [P-CAA]

   Certificate Authority Authorization [I-D.hallambaker-donotissue]
   provides a general purpose, extensible platform that allows domain
   name owners to express certificate issue requirements.  Although
   currently limited to specification of trust roots, it is extensible
   to allow additional properties to be agreed and specified.  While the
   security of CAA is improved with deployment of DNSSEC in the
   specified zone, CAA is still an effective control without DNSSEC.

   Deployment of CAA does not require code at the client or server,
   except that the DNS server used must be recent enough to support
   specification of unknown RRs.  It is thus compatible with [C-Legacy-
   Browser] and [C-Legacy-Server].

6.2.    [P-Short]

   Certificate is issued for short lifetime (24-72 hours).  Servers must
   thus ensure that they continuously update their certificate stores to
   download and install certificates as they are issued.

   One critical issue in this approach is the synchronization of the
   relying party clock to that of the issuing CA (presumed to be within
   a few seconds of UTC).  In order to avoid unnecessary rejection of
   certificates it is probably desirable for a server to only start
   using a certificate 24 hours after the notValidBefore time and to
   renew the certificate 24 hours before the notValidAfter time is
   reached.  Experts are currently looking into the detailed
   implications of timing and short lived certificates.

   By itself, [P-Short] meets criteria [R-Comp] but not [R-Fraud] since
   an attacker can simply request issue of a long lived certificate from
   a compromised CA.

   [P-Short] is netural with respect to [M-Client-Efficiency] and
   requires a significant change to server administration and is thus
   negative for [M-Server-Admin] in the short term.  In the long term

   however, it is much easier to guarantee the reliability of a
   certificate download that must happen every day and is thus
   automated, than a procedure that happens once a year and is likely to
   be forgotten.

   Deployment of [P-Short] is fully compatible with the legacy base of
   deployed browsers which will all accept short lifetime certificates
   and refuse to rely on a certificate that has expired.

6.2.1.   [P-Short]+[P-CAA]

   Use of [P-Short] in combination with an appropriate flag in [P-CAA]
   allows the requirement [R-Fraud] to be met, provided that either the
   CA or the client software checks the CAA record.

   This proposal is identical with respect to the metrics and
   constraints as [P-Short]

6.2.2.  [P-Short-Optimized]

   If the lifetime of a short lived certificate is shorter than the
   validity period accepted for an OCSP or CRL response, a client MAY
   choose to rely on the short lived certificate without performing the
   customary revocation checking.  A PKIX certificate extension MAY be
   specified as a means of enabling a client to determine that a
   certificate is intended for use as a short-lived certificate without
   revocation checking.

   [P-Short-Optimized] allows an improvement in the metric [M-Client-
   Efficiency] by eliminating the need for separate revocation checking.

6.3.   [P-Stapling-Flag]

   A certificate includes a flag that tells relying parties that it is
   only to be used with TLS implementations that support OCSP stapling.
   Should a client attempt to connect to the server that does not offer
   the stapled OCSP response, the connection is invalid and must be
   aborted.

   [P-Stapling-Flag] arguably requires less administration effort than
   [P-Short] as it allows the site to continue to use long lived
   certificates and is thus better on [M-Server-Admin].  The principal
   disadvantage being that it requires deployment of a server that can
   support stapling and is thus worse on [C-Legacy-Server].  The
   stapling flag will only be observed by new clients and the proposal
   thus fails to meet [C-Legacy-Browser].

6.4.  [P-OCSP-LOCAL][P-OCSP-LOCAL-2ND]

   Another proposal similar to [P-Short] is for the subject to host
   their own OCSP responder which is in theory less likely to be
   vulnerable to failure.  This may be the primary OCSP responder
   [P-OCSP-LOCAL] or merely a secondary [P-OCSP-LOCAL-2ND].

   While this approach does not require server support for OCSP stapling
   and is thus compatible with [C-Legacy-Server], the administrative
   effort for the subject is considerably greater and it thus fails on
   [M-Server-Admin].


7.  Security Considerations

   [TBS]


8.  IANA Considerations

   None


9.  Acknowledgements

   This draft draws on input from many contributors, in some cases the
   same proposal being made more than once in different contexts.  The
   concept of short lived certificates was proposed in WAP forum.  This
   proposal and the proposal to use local OCSP was mentioned on a
   Mozilla telecon.
