   can provide information about the MIIS Location.

1.  Introduction

   In IEEE 802 Standard, the Media Independent Handover Services are
   under work through IEEE 802.21 Working Group.  It is consist of three
   services, Media Independent Event Service (MIES), Media Independent
   Command Service (MICS) and Media Independent Information Service
   (MIIS).

   MIIS provides a framework by which a MIH function both in the mobile
   node and in the network can discover and obtain homogeneous and
   heterogeneous network information within a geographical area to
   facilitate handovers.  In the larger scope, the macro objective is to
   acquire a global view of the heterogeneous networks to facilitate
   seamless handovers when roaming across these networks.  MIIS includes
   support for various Information Elements (IEs).  IEs provide
   information that is essential for a handover module to make
   intelligent handover decision.  Figure 1 gives a high level
   description of scenario that distinguish between two different types
   of mobility as Horizontal Handovers and Vertical Handovers.

   Depending on the type of mobility support for different types of
   information elements may be necessary for performing handovers.

   MIIS provides the capability for obtaining the necessary information
   for handovers.  This includes information about lower layers such as
   neighbor maps and other link layer parameters as well as information
   about available higher layer services such as access to internet
   connectivity, availability of VPN services, etc.  The set of
   different higher services privided by the MIIS may constantly evolve.
   At the same time, the list of access networks that are supported by
   MIIS may also evolve.

   During the IEEE 802.21 meeting, DHCP was considered as a candidate
   mechanism to discover an MIIS location that can help mobile terminals
   and network entities in selection of appropriate networks during
   handovers.

   A schema defines structure of information.  A schema is used in the
   802.21 information service to define the structure of each
   information element as well as the relationship among different
   information elements supported.  The MIIS schema is classified into
   two major categories.

   - Basic schema that is essential for every MIH to support and

   - Extended schema that is optional and can be vendor specific

   This document defines a new DHCPv4 option as MIIS Location Discovery
   Option for discovering MIIS information.  Similar options will be
   defined for DHCPv6 in either this document or a seperated one.

2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  MIIS Location Discovery Option

   This option specifies the MIIS Location Discovery that client should
   use when discovering the handover information of MIIS somehow via the
   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [RFC2131]

   The current proposal is focusing on an IP address of an Information

   Service (IS) server.  However, the following different types of
   options related to IS can be configured using DHCP.

   - An FQDN of an IS server

   - An URI of a schema.

   Also, there can be multiple IP addresses, FQDNs or URLs to be
   configurable using DHCP.  So each type of options can carry a list
   instead of just one element.

   This document is only defining new DHCPv4 options at this stage.  New
   DHCPv6 options will be defined in either this document or a separated
   one.

3.1  Overall format for DHCPv4 Option

   The DHCPv4 format of the MIIS Location Discovery Option is shown as
   below;

   The code for this option is TBD.  The length of this option depends
   on which type of information is used for discovering the IS server
   (in case of single IS server).

   The option has three encodings, specified by the encoding byte
   ('enc') that follows the code byte.  if the encoding byte has the
   value 0, it is followed by a list of IP address of IS server.  if the
   encoding byte has the value 1, it is followed by a list of FQDN of IS
   server.  if the encoding byte has the value 2, it is followed by a
   list of URI of schema.  Implementor can choose any specific option
   for discovering MIIS location based on its environment.

   including the encoding byte in octets

   enc: Encoding byte set to 0.

   IS Server IPv4 Address List: IPv4 address of a IS server.  The IS

   option-code: OPTION_IS (TBD)

   option-length: Number of octets following the 'option-length' field,
   including the encoding byte in octets, variable.

   enc: Encoding byte set to 2.

   IS Server Schema URI List: URI a IS server.  This option contains one
   or more URIs of 802.21 Information Service Schemas where the resource
   represented by each URI is the Basic Schema or an Extended Schema
   [ieee80221].  Each URI is encoded as a one octet length field
   followed by that number of octets.  To simplify implementations, the
   total length of a URI is restricted to 255 octets or less.

4.  Security Considerations

   A rouge DHCP server can issue invalid or incorrect MIIS location.
   This may cause denial of service due to unreachability or makes the
   client to reach incorrect destination.

   In case of DHCPv4, the authenticated DHCP [RFC3118] can be also used
   for secure exchange between clients and MIIS locations.

   In case of DHCPv6, the security considerations are described in
   Section 23 of [RFC3315].

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to an assign value for the MIIS Location Discovery
   Option code in accordance with [RFC2939].

6.  DHCPv6 Considerations

   DHCPv6 options should be newly defined to discover MIIS location
   [RFC3315].
