                Proactive Route Optimization for FMIPv6
                draft-espi-ietf-mipshop-profmipv6-00.txt

Abstract

   The Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) protocol was developed
   from the experience of MIPv6 and the facilities provided by link
   layer triggers, allowing for a proactive approach to handover that
   minimises packet exchange delay and packet loss.  On completion of
   handover, the mobile node engages MIPv6 procedures in to update the
   Home Agent with the mobile node's new location.  Subsequently, the
   mobile node may carry out Return Routability with the correspondent
   node(s) for route optimization.  However, this method leaves scope to
   optimize handover delays derived from the signalling message
   exchange.

   This document proposes an enhancement to FMIPv6, the Proactive Route
   Optimization for FMIPv6 (PRO-FMIPv6) protocol, which aims to further
   reduce the signalling load thereby improving the overall performance
   of the handover process.

Internet-Draft                 PRO-FMIPv6                     March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The process of leaving a network link to join another is referred to
   as handover.  Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) [RFC5568]
   enables a proactive approach to handover: before handover, the mobile
   node (MN) forms a new care-of address and solicits the present/
   previous access router to start forwarding packets to that address at
   the next/new access router's link.  As a consequence, the
   communication disruption is limited to the link layer procedures,
   i.e., synchronizing to the new access point (AP).  Subsequently, the
   FMIPv6-enabled MN updates the binding cache of its home agent (HA)
   with its new care-of address (NCoA) and, optionally, the
   correspondent node (CN)'s binding cache for optimal routing via the
   Return Routability procedure [RFC3775].

   The standard procedures based on FMIPv6 handover and route
   optimisation leave scope to reduce the handover delays and the
   signalling latency [RFC4651].  This document introduces Proactive
   Route Optimization for FMIPv6, namely, PRO-FMIPv6, which reduces this
   latency by carrying out the signalling towards route optimization
   proactively.

   More specifically, this specification suggests using
   cryptographically generated addresses to bind the home address (HoA)
   and the previous care-of address (PCoA) to the NCoA.  The signalling
   exchange between MN and CN, carried out proactively, allows the CN to
   check the validity of the new care-of address through a cryptographic
   route test.

   PRO-FMIPv6 is independent of the link-layer technology.  The document
   updates the format of the "(Proactive) Home Address Test Initiation
   (PHoTI)" message, "(Proactive) Care-of Test Initiation (PCoTI)"
   message and "Fast BU (FBU)" message.  It also defines a new type of
   Mobility Header-based option; the "Binding Update Info (BUInfo)".

   The handovers defined in this specification can interwork with MIPv6/
   FMIPv6 enabled networks as they are backwards compatible.

1.1.  Language Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
   The use of the term, "silently ignore" is not defined in RFC 2119.
   However, the term is used in this document and can be similarly
   construed.

   The following terminology and abbreviations are used in this document

   in addition to those defined in [RFC3775, RFC5568].

      Proxy Binding Update (PrBU): It is a BU sent on behalf of the MN
      by any other network entity.

      Token Table: It is kept by the CN.  It contains the MN's HoA, PCoA
      and tentative NCoA, the two tokens used for route optimization
      security check and the NAR's prefix.


2.  Protocol Overview

   The proposed protocol aims to integrate a novel signalling scheme for
   route optimization within the FMIPv6-provided facilities.

   As in FMIPv6, through the "Router Solicitation for Proxy
   Advertisement (RtSolPr)" and "Proxy Router Advertisement (PrRtAdv)"
   messages, the MN also formulates a prospective new CoA (NCoA) when it
   is still present on the PAR's link.  This address can be used
   immediately in the new subnet link when the MN has received a "Fast
   Binding Acknowledgment (FBack)" (see Section 6.2.3 in [RFC5568])
   message prior to its movement.  In the event it moves without
   receiving an FBack, the MN can still use the NCoA after announcing
   its attachment through an "Unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement (UNA)"
   message (with the 'O' bit set to zero) [RFC4861]; the NAR may respond
   to this UNA message if it wishes to provide a different IP address to
   use.  In this way, NCoA configuration latency is reduced.

   The information provided in the PrRtAdv message can be used even when
   DHCP [RFC3315] is used to configure an NCoA on the NAR's link.  In
   this case, the protocol supports forwarding using PCoA, and the MN
   performs DHCP once it attaches to the NAR's link.  The MN still
   formulates an NCoA for FBU processing; however, it MUST NOT send data
   packets using the NCoA in the FBU.

   Like FMIPv6, the MN generates the NCoA from the NAR's prefix,
   included in the PrRtAdv message.  However, additionally, the MN
   generates two random numbers (tokens).  The NCoA is form as shown in
   equation (1).

   NCoA = NAR_prefix | hash (HoA | token1 | token2)     (1)

   Each of the tokens (token1 and token2) is included in a Mobility
   Header-based message (PHoTI and PCoTI) that traverse different paths
   to the CN.  The PHotI message is sent to the CN via the HA just like
   the HoTI message in standard MIPv6, and the PCoTI message is sent via
   the NAR.  The CN receives both packets (PHoTI and PCoTI) from the
   home and care-of addresses respectively.  This requires both the HA



Espi & Atkinson        Expires September 24, 2010               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                 PRO-FMIPv6                     March 2010


   and the NAR to proxy those packets, i.e., the HA has to set the IPv6
   source address field in the PHoTI packet to the home address, and the
   NAR has to set the PCoTI source address to the new care-of address.
   Moreover, the PAR and the HA update their MN's NCoA entries with the
   NCoA included in the PHoTI message.

   On receipt of the two tokens, the CN is able to check whether the
   home and care-of addresses fit with that in equation (1).  If the
   NCoA is valid, the CN updates its binding cache and replies with a
   BA.  However, if the check is not valid, the packets are silently
   discarded.

   Immediately after sending FBU | PHoTI and PCoTI, the MN starts layer
   2 handover.  After joining the new link, the MN announces its
   attachment with a UNA message that instructs NAR to forward packets
   to the MN.

   The MN MUST receive a FBack message from the PAR indicating the
   tunnel is correctly set.  The MN MUST receive at least one FBack
   since this message is bicasted from the PAR to both the PCoA and
   NCoA.

   Likewise, the MN MUST receive a BA from the HA acknowledging the MN's
   NCoA.  Also, if the CN's validity check is met, the CN MUST send a BA
   to the NCoA.

Internet-Draft                 PRO-FMIPv6                     March 2010


4.1.1.  Data Structures

   In addition to a Bining Cache, the CN MUST maintain a Token Table,
   where the CN keeps track of the tokens received and mobility related
   information from the MN.  Each MN already contacting the CN towards
   route optimization has one entry.  Each entry has five fields:

      HoA: obtained at session set up

      NCoA: retrieved from PHoTI (IP in IP encapsulation) and PCoTI
      messages

      Token1: token included in PHoTI message

      Token2: token included in PCoTI message

      NAR's prefix: retrieved from PCoTI message

   This Token Table MAY be implemmented in any manner consistent with
   the behaviour described in this document.

4.1.2.  Route Optimization Signalling

4.1.2.1.  Receiving PHoTI and PCoTI

   The CN, on receipt of either the PHoTI or the PCoTI message, MUST
   create an (incomplete) entry in the Token Table.  This entry will be
   kept until the second message is received or MAX_TOKEN LIFETIME
   seconds are elapsed.  The MAX_TOKEN LIFETIME timeout period is
   devised to prevent memory exhaustion due to the size of the CN's
   Token Table.

   If both messages are correctly received within a MAX_TOKEN LIFETIME
   seconds time frame, then the CN will MUST validate the following
   tests:

      NCoA MUST be a unicast routable address.

      PHoTI and PCoTI MUST have same nonce index.

      Fields in the Token Table MN's entry (NAR's prefix, tokens 1 and
      2, Home Address) MUST meet equation (1).

   If the tests are met, then the CN processes the BUInfo option
   (included in the PHoTI message) as described in RFC 3775, Section
   9.5.1.  Next, the CN sends a BA to the MN's NCoA according to RFC
   3775, Section 9.5.4.

Internet-Draft                 PRO-FMIPv6                     March 2010


   If the tests are not met, the MN's entry is removed from the Token
   Table.

4.1.2.2.  Sending Binding Acks

   Refer to RFC 3775, Section 9.5.4.

4.1.2.3.  Sending Binding Refresh Requests

   This document does not address refreshing bindings.

4.2.  Home Agent Operation

   The Home Agent operation is largely based on [RFC3775].  On receipt
   of a PHoTI message, the Home Agent checks the validity of the
   enclosed BU Info option.  If the validity check is successful, the
   Home Agent MUST send a BA to the MN's NCoA.  Next, the Home Agent
   forwards the PHoTI message to the CN's address.

   However, if the validity check fails, the Home Agent silently ignores
   the PHoTI message.

   The Binding Cache entry is to last MAX_RR_BINDING LIFETIME seconds.
   In the eventuality of expiration of the Binding Cache entry, the Home
   Agent operates as in [RFC3775].

4.3.  New Access Router Operation

   The NAR MUST behave as stated in [RFC5568].

   Prior to handoff, the MN sends the PHoTI and the PCoTI messages, that
   traverse different paths towards the CN.  The PCoTI message is routed
   along the PCoA-NCoA-CN path.  The NAR, on recepit of the PCoTI
   message, MUST forward it to the CN, including the PCoA as a home
   address option (defined in [RFC3775]).

4.4.  Previous Access Router Operation

   The PAR MUST behave as stated in [RFC5568].  Additionally, of receipt
   of the PoTI message, it MUST forward it to the HA, including the PCoA
   as a home address option ([RFC3775]).

4.5.  Mobile Node Operation

   The protocol begins when the MN sends the RtSolPr to its PAR to
   resolve one or more Access Points Identifiers to subnet-specific
   information.  In response, the PAR sends the PrRtAdv containing one
   or more [AP-ID, AR-Info] tuples [RFC5568].



Espi & Atkinson        Expires September 24, 2010              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                 PRO-FMIPv6                     March 2010


   From the information received in the PrRtAdv message, the MN
   generates a prospective NCoA using equation (1).  In order to do so,
   the MN generates two random tokens that it concatenates to the HoA
   and applies a SHA1 hash function to the result.

   The MN will then send two messages, the FBU and the PCoTI.

   The FBU message comprises a PHoTI message and a BUInfo option
   enclosed in a MIPv6 FBU message.  The MN sends this message to the
   PAR.  In the BUInfo option, bit 'A' MUST be set.

   The PCoTI message is sent to the NAR, that will forward it to the CN
   (IPv6 encapsulation).

   Next, the MN performs handover to the NAR.  After the attachment, the
   MN should receive two acknowledgements, specifically, from the PAR
   and the HA.  The MN may receive a third acknowledgement from the CN,
   in the special case wherethe CN is PRO-FMIPv6 enabled.


5.  Configurable Parameters

   Mobile nodes rely on the configuration parameters defined in section
   12 of [RFC3775] and section 9 of [RFC5568].  Each mobile node MUST
   have a configuration mechanism to adjust the parameters.

   In addition, the value of MAX_TOKEN LIFETIME ([RFC3775]) is reduced
   to 3 seconds.  The rationale behind this is that the MN sends both
   the PHoTI and PCoTI messages simultaneously and therefore the CN
   expects to receive them at approximately the same time.


6.  Security Considerations

   Firstly, a malicious MN may try to redirect traffic from his HoA or
   PCoA to a NCoA.  E.g., if a MN is connected with a server through a
   high-speed connection, the MN could redirect the stream towards a
   low-speed NAR (in terms of processing or link capacity).

   PRO-FMIPv6 precludes MN from carrying out this kind of attacks: The
   NAR can voluntarily discard the PCoTI message if the QoS required for
   the MN is too high, if the proposed NCoA is not acceptable, if the
   source PCoA or HoA is from a domain not accepted, if the NAR does not
   have any established trust relationship with the PAR, if the demanded
   buffer size is too high or if the access control parameters do not
   meet the security requirements.  The NAR retrieves information on all
   the previously mentioned issues from the HI message.

Internet-Draft                 PRO-FMIPv6                     March 2010


   Even if this kind of Denial of Service (DoS) attack could be
   effectively carried out, the malevolent MN would not be capable of
   specifying any concrete IPv6 address.  The rationally behind that is
   that it would be virtually impossible for a MN to find two random
   numbers such that the result of equation (1) is equivalent to the
   target IPv6 address.

   Secondly, a malicious 3rd party may try to steal a node's (either
   mobile or fixed) IPv6 address by creating a binding cache entry at
   the CN.  PRO-FMIPv6 prevents attackers from doing this.  In case a HA
   receives a PHoTI message for whose HoA has no administrative
   agreement, it silently ignores it.

   Thirdly, one or more attackers may want to consume all the memory
   available in the CN's tokens table by sending a number of PHoTI or
   PCoTI messages.  In any case, every time a CN receives a BU|t1 or
   BU|t2 the CN overrides the correspondent HoA or NCoA respectively, so
   therefore there is only one entry at the tokens table for each MN,
   independently of how frequently performs the signalling towards route
   optimization.  Moreover, registers in the token table are only kept
   for MAX_TOKEN LIFETIME seconds.

   Finally, the protocol inherits the vulnerabilities identified in
   [RFC5568] for the RtSolPr, PrRtAdv and FBU messages.
