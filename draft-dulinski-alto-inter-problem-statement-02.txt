               Inter-ALTO Communication Problem Statement
             draft-dulinski-alto-inter-problem-statement-02

Abstract

   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol has been
   standardized in RFC7285 to ease better-than-random overlay connection
   management.  Due to various reasons, optimization capabilities of
   ALTO servers are limited by the fact that it may not be possible for
   an ALTO server to compute costs for source/destination pairs
   correctly if a source and/or a destination is outside the
   administrative domain it belongs to.  In other words, an ALTO server
   may be generally unable to optimize the traffic with only locally
   available topology information.

   Therefore, it is proposed that operators of distinct administrative
   domains may agree on topology- and policy-related information
   exchange through a standardized inter-ALTO communication framework.
   This document provides a rationale for design, standardization, and
   implementation of the inter-ALTO communication framework.

1.  Introduction

   As stated in [RFC5693], information on network topologies and routing
   policies in today Internet is not generally available to the
   application layer.  At the same time, a lot of new overlay
   applications creating their own topologies on top of the physical one
   emerge.  As both network operators and users of the overlay
   applications may benefit from better-than-random overlay connection
   management, the ALTO protocol has been standardized in [RFC7285].

   Topology- and policy-related information may be supplied through ALTO
   in a proactive or in a reactive way.  In the former case, an ALTO
   server distributes network and cost maps through which a client may
   compute costs of sending the traffic, while in the latter case, a
   client may request a server to provide rating of explicitly specified
   source and destination pairs using the endpoint cost service.  As a
   server provides information composed only from information that can

   be gathered by it and applies polices defined by operator of the
   administrative domain it belongs to, the returned information has
   always local meaning to the server - regardless of the method used by
   a client to request guidance from it.  Moreover, an ALTO client may
   not be able to receive ALTO information from outside of its
   administrative domain.

   Due to various reasons, it may be generally not possible to optimize
   the traffic with only locally available topology information.
   Therefore, in this document, it is proposed that operators of
   distinct administrative domains may agree on topology- and policy-
   related information exchange through a standardized inter-ALTO
   communication framework.

   Among others, the inter-ALTO communication framework may allow an
   operator of one administrative domain to apply its policies to
   topology information gathered from other administrative domains.
   Moreover, a server may have separate security contexts for processes
   responsible for server-to-client (i.e., ALTO) and server-to-server
   (i.e., inter-ALTO) communication to ensure that no sensitive
   topology- and policy-related information is distributed in an
   uncontrolled way.

   The requirements for the inter-ALTO communication framework, its
   detailed specification and issues related to server discovery
   [RFC7286] are out of scope of this document.

2.  Definitions

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5693] and
   [RFC7285]: ALTO Server, ALTO Client, Endpoint, Peering Traffic,
   Transit Traffic.  Moreover, the following terms have the special
   meaning in the definition of the inter-ALTO communication problem.

   Local Administrative Domain:  The administrative domain which the
         ALTO client belongs to.

   Remote Administrative Domain:  An administrative domain other than
         the one which the ALTO client belongs to.

   Local ALTO Server:  An ALTO server belonging to the local
         administrative domain.

   Remote ALTO Server:  An ALTO server belonging to a remote
         administrative domain.

   Local Endpoint:  An endpoint belonging to the local administrative
         domain.

   Remote Endpoint:  An endpoint belonging to a remote administrative
         domain.

3.  Motivation for Inter-ALTO Communication

   Optimization capabilities of ALTO servers are limited by the fact
   that they use information available locally only.  It can be shown
   that without additional information on remote endpoints, routing
   paths, or remote administrative domains' preferences, rating provided
   by an ALTO server may be sub-optimal for both sides.  Data from
   remote administrative domains obtained from an ALTO server holding
   authoritative information about those domains' topologies may have a
   substantial significance for the traffic management.

   The ALTO Protocol specification [RFC7285] states that:

      It may also be possible for an ALTO server to exchange network
      information with other ALTO servers (either within the same
      administrative domain or another administrative domain with the
      consent of both parties) in order to adjust exported ALTO
      information.  Such a protocol is also outside the scope of this
      specification.

   This document provides a rationale for design, standardization, and
   implementation of the inter-ALTO communication framework, described
   as "External Interface" in Figure 1 of [RFC7285].  The requirements
   and detailed specification are out of scope of this document.

             Figure 1: Inter-ALTO communication architecture.

   The architecture of the inter-ALTO communication framework is shown
   in Figure 1.  Both ALTO servers gather the information from their
   information sources like routing protocols, provisioning policies, or
   dynamic network information sources using respective provisioning
   protocols.  To provide (using the ALTO Protocol) better guidance for
   its clients, the local ALTO server needs to communicate with remote
   ALTO servers to obtain information which is available only at the
   entities in the remote administrative domains.

   In particular, two general use-cases of inter-ALTO communication may
   be distinguished:

   o  providing the local ALTO server with information on remote view of
      the multi-domain topology;






Dulinski, et al.         Expires January 7, 2016                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft Inter-ALTO Communication Problem Statement      July 2015


   o  providing the local ALTO server with information on remote network
      topology, more accurate than available from the local information
      sources.

   Moreover, for partitioned networks run by one organization or a
   consortium, both use-cases are valid.

3.1.  Remote View of Topology

   Due to the complex topology of the current Internet and independent
   application of routing policies in autonomous systems, the
   communication between two endpoints does not need to follow the same
   path in the opposite directions.  Moreover, there is a significant
   disproportion between availability of information on upstream and
   downstream paths.  While the current local information sources can
   easily export data on the former, the latter are generally unknown to
   ISPs.  Depending on the deployment-specific use-case and cost metric
   applied, this fact may indeed affect the ALTO server's ability to
   calculate the costs.

   For a set of reasons (e.g., application performance or quality
   perceived by end-users) an ALTO server may suggest its clients to
   connect to endpoints located in their proximity.  One of the simplest
   measures of proximity is the number of AS hops, as announced by BGP.
   As indicated above, due to the route asymmetry, the number of AS hops
   between two communicating endpoints may significantly differ between
   the upstream and downstream paths.

   Under other circumstances, an ISP may prefer to reduce the transit
   traffic by increasing the peering one and it may configure its ALTO
   server to differentiate endpoints into classes taking into account
   through which links the traffic is exchanged and what are its
   business relationships with its neighbors.  Still, as the Internet
   routes are asymmetrical, a reply for request sent to an endpoint
   through a peering link may return via a transit one (or vice versa).

   Therefore, an ALTO server may easily calculate costs of sending the
   traffic from the local administrative domain to remote ones, while
   calculation of correct costs of receiving the content from the remote
   administrative domains may be not possible at all.  To mitigate this
   situation, the inter-ALTO communication framework may be used to
   exchange information on downstream paths between two interested
   parties.  If a local ALTO server would be able to gather such
   information, a risk of suboptimal endpoint rating may be greatly
   reduced.

Internet-Draft Inter-ALTO Communication Problem Statement      July 2015


3.2.  Detailed Information on Remote Topology

   The second use-case stems from the fact that a lot of topology
   information is lost when a prefix is being announced via BGP by one
   AS to others.  Moreover, prefix aggregation often used to reduce the
   size of routing tables causes that a number of networks of different
   characteristics are announced as one network.  Therefore, a local
   ALTO server may consider - regardless of the cost metric used - two
   remote endpoints as equal, while they should be in fact
   differentiated.

   For instance, a remote administrative domain may comprise (among
   others) of a set of networks connected to its core by expensive links
   or containing endpoints of worse capabilities than those in the rest
   of its network.  Then, inter-ALTO communication may be used to denote
   such a fact and to characterize endpoints properly.  Similarly, when
   some remote endpoints stand out above the rest, they may be promoted
   by the local ALTO server.

   A cost metric may also take into account congestions on intra- and
   inter-domain links or another exhaustive consumption of some
   resources.  When a link becomes congested for a longer period of
   time, it may be desirable to promote endpoints reachable through
   lightly loaded links.  Likewise, a set of endpoints providing a
   content or a service may be overloaded and clients should be
   discouraged from using them.  Regardless of the reason for endpoint
   differentiation, a local ALTO server may be informed by a remote one
   about remote domain's preference in endpoint selection.

3.3.  Partitioned Networks

   Means for exchange of detailed information on view of network
   topology may be also important for partitioned networks, run by one
   organization or a consortium of organizations fully trusting each
   other.  To optimize the traffic flowing within partitions and between
   them, ALTO servers located in each partition may exchange detailed
   network topology information.  In principle, ALTO servers may be
   deployed hierarchically or in a mesh.  When a hierarchical
   architecture is used, a central ALTO server may gather a view of
   topology information from the rest of ALTO servers, merge the
   information, calculate the costs for all source/destination pairs,
   and distribute the merged network and cost maps to the ALTO servers
   and/or serve ALTO clients from all partitions.  ALTO servers may be
   as well set up in each partition independently, connected to each
   other, gathering the network topology information from other
   partitions, and serving their own clients.

Internet-Draft Inter-ALTO Communication Problem Statement      July 2015


   In both deployment schemes, both remote view of the inter-partition
   topology (see Section 3.1) and detailed view of remote partition
   topology (see Section 3.2) may bring a lot of benefit to the
   organization/consortium.  The former can be used to optimize the
   traffic flowing between the partitions, while the latter may allow an
   ALTO server to differentiate endpoints within one partition.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not define any new media types nor does it
   introduce any new IANA considerations.

5.  Security Considerations

   In general, communication between ALTO servers run by distinct
   parties and exchange of information on their topologies may require a
   formal agreement between them, mutual authentication, and
   authorization.  Since sensitive data may be exchanged, a secure
   deployment of inter-ALTO communication framework may require setting
   up encrypted tunnels or using SSL between the ALTO servers.

   The inter-ALTO communication may allow ALTO servers to exchange any
   parameters which allow them to manage traffic in an optimal way for
   mutual benefit.  In order to achieve these results a set of
   administrative domains may exchange sensitive data which should be
   kept confidential.  They should be used to calculate the cost maps,
   but should not be revealed directly to a third party, e.g., an ALTO
   client.  To implement such a differentiation, an ALTO server may need
   to use separate security contexts for client-to-server and server-to-
   server communication.

   Moreover, to ease secure environment deployment, administrative
   domains may form ALTO server communities, i.e., groups of ALTO
   servers trusting each other and working for common benefit.
