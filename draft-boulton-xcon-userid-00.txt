1.  Introduction

   This document defines a user identifier and syntax to identify a
   conference user within a conferencing system.  A conferencing system
   is defined by "A framework and Data Model for Centralized
   Conferencing" [3] and represents a container for administering and
   managing all related information ranging from conference policy to
   conference instance management.  Within a conferencing system it is
   useful to have the concept of a conference user.  A conference user
   identifies the entity participating in a conference and attempting to
   manipulate conferencing system related properties.

   A centralized conference as defined in [3] is both signaling and
   protocol agnostic.  However, users interface with the conferencing
   system using specific protocol and signaling interfaces.  Each of
   these protocols/interfaces often define their own user identifier,
   which provides a contextual representation of who exactly is
   associated with a specific protocol or signaling interface.

   This document provides a top level common user identifier to
   associate these related protocol and interface user identifiers.  It
   also provides guidelines on how this conferencing system wide user
   identifier can be used to derive a protocol or interface specific
   user.  The centralised user management allows for control over
   uniqueness within a system.  It also aids in the creation and
   management of conferencing system wide policies.


2.  Conventions and Terminology

   In this document, BCP 14/RFC 2119 [1] defines the key words "MUST",
   "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL".  In
   addition, BCP 15 indicates requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

   This document uses the terminology defined in [3] and also defines
   the following additional terms:
   TODO  : TODO.


3.  Overview

   Each user within a conferencing system is allocated a unique
   Conference User Identifier.  The conference user identifier is used
   in association with the conference object identifier defined in [TBD]
   and by the conference control protocol to uniquely identify a
   conference user within the scope of a conferencing system.  The

   conference control protocol uses the conference user identifier to
   uniquely determine who is issuing commands.  Appropriate policies can
   then be applied to the requested command.

   As with the conference object identifier, a number of supplementary
   user identifiers defined in other protocols are used within a
   conference instance.  Such user identifiers can be associated with
   this conference user identifier and enable the conferencing system to
   correlate and map these multiple authenticated user identities to a
   single global user identifier.

   Figure 1 illustrates an example using the conference user identifier
   in association with the user identity defined for BFCP and SIP Digest
   user identity as defined in RFC3261[2], which would be used when SIP
   is the call signaling protocol.  It should be noted that a
   conferencing system is free to structure such relationships as
   required and this information is just included as a guideline that
   can be used.

                   Figure 1: Conference User Identifier

   Within a conferencing system, a user is identified by a single
   conference user identifier.  Any additional conferencing mechanisms
   that contain a protocol specific user ID can be associated with the
   conference user identifier, as illustrated in Figure 1.  This
   mechanism allows conferencing systems to manage and relate system
   wide user identities in relation to specific conference objects and
   helps in the enforcement of system wide policies.

   The following example illustrates the representation and
   relationships that might occur in a typical conference instance.  The

   hierarchy and association.

   The information from Figure 2 can then be applied to the

                   Figure 3: User ID Tree Representation

   Further elements can be added to the tree representation in Figure 3
   to enable a complete representation of a conference instance within a
   conferencing system.

   If a conferencing system can guarantee that user identities for
   varying protocols can use one unique identifier across the whole
   system then this type of mechanism is not required.  Some systems
   require more complex user identity association.  For example, a SIP
   User dialing into a Conference might enter using a PIN code using

   DTMF.  The PIN code would then be used to uniquely identify the
   conference user within the conferencing system.  If a system wide
   conference user identifier is used it MUST comply to the syntax
   specified in Section 4 and used for various other protocols/
   interfaces using the mapping rules defined in Section 3.1.

3.1.  User ID Mapping

   [Editors Note: Strict mapping rules will be defined once Section 4 is
   completed].


4.  Conference User Identifier Definition

   This section provides the details for the definition of the
   Conference User Identifier.

   [Editors Note: Discussion is needed to work through the details
   including (not exclusively) consideration of the following:
   1. How much normative detail do we need to include in this document
      for the conference user identifier?
   2. Or are the details of the conference user identifier
      implementation specific and we just need to provide examples?
   3. Does the definition require that the mapping to the user ids for
      other protocols be obvious (e.g., visibly derivable or would that
      be implementation specific?
   ].




5.  Conference User Distribution

   This section details the distribution of the conference user
   identifier to the conferencing clients.  A typical mode for
   distributing the user identifer is out of band during conferencing
   client configuration, thus the mechanism is outside the scope of the
   centralized conferencing framework and protocols.  However, a
   conferencing system should also be capable of allocating and
   distributing a user identifier during the first signaling interaction
   with the conferencing system, such as an initial request for
   blueprints or adding a new user to an existing conference.

   [Editor's Note: Further details will be added once there is
   resolution on some of the previous sections and more details defined
   for the conference control protocol.]
