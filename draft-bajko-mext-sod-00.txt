Abstract 
    
   The Mobile IPv6 and Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 protocols only provide a 
   means to secure the user plane traffic but do not provide any 
   mechanisms by which the security is triggered as a result of 
   mobility or the MN attaching via different access networks.

Security On Demand                                        Feb 28, 2010 
    
   This document proposes extensions to Mobile IPv6 and Dual-stack 
   Mobile IPv6 protocols, allowing the Mobile Node to signal to the 
   Home Agent its preference for user plane traffic security, and for 
   the Home Agent to override that preference based on policy settings.

1. Introduction 
    
   Mobile IPv6 [MIP6] and Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 [DSMIP6] provide the 
   option to secure the user plane data between the Mobile Node (MN) 
   and and the Home Agent (HA) when needed. The user plane traffic 
   between the MN and HA is secured via an IPsec security association 
   (SA) which is established between them specifically for the purpose 
   of user plane data. IPsec is used for securing the user plane 
   traffic when the security between the MN and HA is based on IPsec. 
   However security between the MN and HA could also be enabled via 
   other means such as the use of TLS and keys that are exchanged. This 
   alternative security solution is now being proposed in the IETF and 
   details of this are in [draft-korhonen].  
    
   As per the current specifications for MIP6 and DSMIP6, security of 
   the user plane traffic is optional. When the MN is attached to 
   networks such as HSPA, LTE or EV-DO, the MN may not require security 
   for the user plane traffic since these networks already provide 
   ciphering over the air-interface and deploy hop-by-hop security, 
   which makes these networks secure. However the MN may attach to less 
   secure or unsecured accesses such as wireless lan (WLAN) or it may 
   roam in countries where the user may prefer the data between the MN 
   and the HA to be encrypted (even when using cellular accesses). 
   There is no solution in the protocol specification today which 
   provides the capability to trigger the security for the user plane 
   traffic on a need basis.  
    
   The problem that is being addressed is the triggering of security 
   for user plane traffic between the MN and HA on a need basis. Policy 
   information at the MN or information provided to the MN via other 
   means at the time of attachment may assist the MN to determine if

Security On Demand                                        Feb 28, 2010 
    
   security needs to be enabled for user plane traffic. The user may 
   also consciously decide to enable security when attached to certain 
   networks. Furthermore, the operator of HA may have policies that 
   define when user plane security is to be used. This document 
   describes a mechanism which can enable security for user plane 
   traffic on-demand or need. 
    
   An obvious implementation alternative would be to encrypt user plane 
   traffic always (as is commonly done with VPN use-cases), but that 
   would unnecessarily consume resources on the HA. For the HA operator 
   there is clear economic incentive to encrypt user-plane data only 
   when necessary. 
   The MIP6/DSMIP6 protocols only provide a means to secure the user 
   plane traffic but do not provide any mechanisms by which the 
   security is triggered as a result of mobility or the MN attaching 
   via different access networks. 
    
2. When to apply Security to user plane traffic 
    
   When the MN attaches to an access network, it is usually able to 
   determine if the access network is viewed as trusted or untrusted. 
   The MN can make this determination, for example, based on the PLMN 
   ID of the cellular network; or wifi_SSID/MAC_address of a wifi 
   network; or location information provided by the MN, or user input. 
   The MN has either a stored policy about trusted and untrusted access 
   networks or it may be provided with such information from policy 
   stores such as the ANDSF [23.402] or AAA server at the time of 
   network attachment. An interface exists generally between the policy 
   store such as AAA or ANDSF and the Home Agent (HA).   
    
   If the MN is attached to an access network which is viewed as 
   trusted or where encryption is not allowed, the MN chooses not to 
   secure the user plane traffic.  
    
   If the MN is attached to an access network which is not trusted, the 
   MN may want to secure its user plane traffic. The HA may also be 
   able to determine from the source address of the binding update (BU) 
   message the access network to which the MN is currently attached. 
   Based on this information, the HA may require that the user plane 
   traffic be encrypted on the MN-HA link. 
    
   The MN or HA can determine when to use security for the user plane 
   traffic using static policies or dynamic policies which can be 
   obtained at the time of network attachment - or e.g. which are 
   provisioned and maintained on a smartcard (eg, a UICC or SIM). 3GPP 
   policy stores such as the ANDSF can also provide information about 
   the access networks to which an MN is attached. Location of the MN 
   can also be used as input.

Security On Demand                                        Feb 28, 2010 
    
   This document proposes extensions to MIPv6/DSMIPv6 protocol, 
   allowing the MN to signal to the HA its preference for user plane 
   traffic security, and for the HA to override that preference based 
   on the policy settings. 
    
   One of the reserved bits of the Binding Update [RFC3775] message is 
   defined to be the 'Security' flag "S", and one of the reserved bits 
   of the Binding Acknowledgement [RFC3775] message is also defined to 
   be the 'Security' flag "S". 
    
   The MN sends a binding update with the "S" flag set to 0, when 
   indicating that the user plane traffic will not be encrypted. The HA 
   processes the binding update message from the MN and sends a 
   response acknowledging the request and setting the flag for user 
   plane traffic security to Null indicating to the MN that the traffic 
   on the link between the MN and HA will not be encrypted. 
    
   The MN sends a binding update with the "S" flag set to 1, when 
   indicating that prefers the user plane traffic be encrypted. The HA 
   processes the binding update message from the MN and sends a 
   response acknowledging the request and setting the flag for user 
   plane traffic security to 1, indicating to the MN that the traffic 
   on the link between the MN and HA will be encrypted. 
    
   The HA MAY always overwrite the MN's security preference on the user 
   plane traffic indicated in the Binding Update message, by setting 
   the "S" flag in the Binding Acknowledgement to a different value. 
    
   The MN SHALL always follow the indication in the Binding 
   Acknowledgement to set the security of the MN to HA user plane 
   traffic.
