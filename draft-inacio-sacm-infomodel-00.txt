                         SACM Information Model
                     draft-inacio-sacm-infomodel-00

Abstract

   This defines the information model for the Security Automation and
   Continuous Monitoring (SACM) standards.  The working group faces a
   set of complex issues when trying to define an information model that
   complicates this effort:

   o  There are many standards in the SACM space which are not
      interoperable

   o  There exists an extremely large and diverse set of data types
      which are desirable to exchange

   o  Many data types depend on the operating systems from which they
      are collected; making a universal typing harder

   o  A goal of SACM is to cover a diverse set of system types

   These complex needs create a information model which is difficult to
   unify within the environment.  Instead, this information model design
   is focused on minimum needed functionality with the desire to include
   a type system design into the information model allowing for easy
   expandability.  It is envisioned that this information model will
   serve the following purposes:

   o  Enough well specified elements in order to exchange key data
      fields between systems

   o  Sufficient typing system to expand key fields over time and use of
      a registry to standardize common expansions

   o  Meta information such that compplete information exchange using
      various other formats understood by all parties can be used as
      needed to exchange complete records on demand

   o  Sufficient action verbs defined to allow orchestration between
      various systems to allow unified control of federated components

1.  Introduction

   The set of elements which are desired to standarize are the subset of
   data elements used within the SACM standards and related standards.
   To this end, the core capability to reasonably identify a network end
   point and minimally describe an event along with enough information
   that two parties involved in the communication may determine a way
   forward for further information exchange.  The minimal set of
   activity and endpoint identifiers will allow parties participating in
   SACM communications to effectively search their respecitive data
   stores for relevent and related information and respond to queries or
   accept events in kind.

   This information model is intended to describe a minimal number of
   elements which enable this functionality, but also sufficiently
   describe the attributes which can define those elements.  This
   combination of information intends to provide enough meta information
   about information elements to allow both in protocol definition of
   types in possible data models as well as clear construction of future
   standardized element definitions.  Conversely, this information model
   is not attempting to define all possible information elements that
   need to be exchanged.  Many information elements, especially those
   related to host monitoring, are heavily related to the operating
   system and related software for proper context - beyond the initial
   scope of this standard.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Additionally, the key words "*MIGHT*", "*COULD*", "*MAY WISH TO*",
   "*WOULD PROBABLY*", "*SHOULD CONSIDER*", and "*MUST (BUT WE KNOW YOU
   WON'T)*" in this document are to interpreted as described in RFC 6919
   [RFC6919].

2.  Minimal Needed Information Elements

   IP Address, hostname, time/date, SWID/CoSWID ID's, firmware versions,
   serial number, MAC address, certificate ID

3.  Information Element Metadata

   name, basic_data_type, octet_length, data_use_type (label, counter,
   gauge), description, std/vendor type, structure/composite

   The following fields are defined in the set of metadata about each
   information element

   name:
      A descriptive but concise name to be used for human understanding

   basic data type:
      A fundamental data type supported by the this information model.
      The predefined types include unsigned integers, signed integers,
      octet array, string, IP addresses, MAC addresses

   octet length:
      The number of octets maximally used for this information

   data use type:
      This refines the basic data type expressing the usage of the
      value.  For example, some integers represent mathematical values
      and may be added together (counts for example) while some things
      may be expressed as an integer, but are really a type of label
      (e.g.  IP address)

   description:
      A longer textual description of this data type

   registration domain:
      The domain in which this information element is defined.

   composite structure:
      The definition of the composite structure of following elements,
      e.g. list, set, map
