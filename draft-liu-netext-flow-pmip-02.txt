              IKEv2 based flow control extension of PMIPv6
                     draft-liu-netext-flow-pmip-02

Abstract

   PMIPv6 is designed to provide network based mobility, it requries no
   changes to the UE.  There are proposals to extend PMIPv6 to support
   flow mobility.  Flow mobility requries the UE and the network having
   communication protocol to carry the flow control messages.  This
   document proposes to use the extended IKEv2 protocol to carry the
   flow control messages between the UE and network.

Internet-Draft      IKEv2 based flow control for PMIP          July 2010


1.  Introduction

   There are proposals to extend PMIPv6 to support flow mobility.  But
   there is currently no protocol is specified between the UE and
   network which is used to carry the flow control policies.  Since
   PMIPv6 is aimed to provide network based mobility solution and no UE
   changes is prefered, it is not feasible to define new protocol
   between the UE and network which is used to carry the flow control
   information.  This document proposes to use extended IKE protocol to
   carry the flow control information.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL","SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Overview of using IKEv2 to carry flow control information

   IKEv2 is used for security parameter negotiation.  It is usally used
   combine with IPSec.  There are configuration payload options in IKEv2
   which could be used for IP address allocation and other configuration
   purposes.  This document proposes to extend the configuration
   payloads to carry the flow control information.

   IKEv2/IPSec is also used for protecting mobility signalling in 3GPP.
   In 3GPP architecture, s2b interface is based on PMIP and used for un-
   trusted non-3GPP access.  There is an IPSec tunnel between the UE and
   the un-trusted non- 3GPP access gateway(ePDG).  This IPSec tunnel's
   security association and other security parameters are set up using
   IKEv2.  Except for the security function, the IKEv2 protocol between
   the UE and no-3GPP access gateway(ePDG) is also used for IP address
   configuration.  The IP address is carried by configuration payload in
   IKEv2.

   From the above analysis, we can see that there is a mandatory IKEv2
   protocol running between the UE and the network in 3GPP s2b
   interface.  It is natural to consider extending this protocol to
   carry the flow mobility control information.


4.  IKEv2 configuration payload extension

   IKEv2's configuration payload is defined to carry configuration
   information, for example: IP address allocation etc.  The format of
   the configration payload is as follows:

            Figure 1: Format of Configuration Payload of IKEv2

   As Figure 1 depicted, IKEv2 configuration payload has CFG Type and
   configuration attributes options.  CFG Type includes CFG_REQUEST,
   CFG_REPLY, CFG_SET, CFG_ACK.  "CFG_SET/CFG_ACK" allows an IKE
   endpoint to push configuration data to its peer.  "CFG_REQUEST/
   CFG_REPLY" allows an IKE endpoint to request information from its
   peer.

   Configuration attributes has the following format:

5.  MN operation

   for flow mobility, MN decides when to initiate flow handover.  MN
   uses the above extended IKEv2 configureation payload extension to
   send the flow control message.  Flow mobility polilcy control
   function need to communicate with the IKE module in the MN to carry
   the flow mobility control information.


6.  MAG operation

   MAG needs to get the flow mobility control information from the IKE
   configration payload extension.  MAG then send PBU message with the
   flow mobility extension.


7.  LMA operation

   LMA get flow control information from the PBU which carries the flow
   mobility extension.  Then it control the flow mobility action
   accordingly.


8.  Security Considerations

   TBD


9.  IANA Considerations

   None
