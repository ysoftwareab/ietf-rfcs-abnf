3.  Security considerations

      The XML-based media type being registered has all of the security
      considerations described in [RFC3023] plus additional
      considerations.

      Playlist authors who publish documents containing local filesystem
      paths should take care to not reveal confidential information
      contained in those strings.

      The registration does not employ active content.
