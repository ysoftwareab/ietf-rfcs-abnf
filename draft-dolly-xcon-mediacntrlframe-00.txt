Abstract

   This document provides requirements for a protocol, that will enable
   one physical entity that includes the media policy server,
   notification server and the focus to interact with one or more
   physical entities that serves as mixer or media server.  It will
   address all phases and aspects of media handling in a conferencing
   service including announcements and IVR functionality.

Internet-Draft      Media Control Protocol Framework        October 2005


1.  Overview

   The IETF XCON conferencing framework presents an architecture that is
   built of several functional entities.  The framework document does
   not specify the protocols between the functional entities since it is
   considered out of scope.

   There is an interest to work on a protocol that will enable one
   physical entity that includes the media policy server, notification
   server and the focus to interact with one or more physical entities
   that serves as mixer or media server.

   The document will present the requirements for such a protocol.  It
   will address all phases and aspects of media handling in a enhanced
   conferencing service including announcements and IVR functionality.


2.  Terminology

   The Media Server work uses when appropriate and expands on the
   terminology introduced in the SIP conferencing framework and XCON
   conferencing framework.  The following additional terms are defined
   for use within the Media Server work.

   Application Server (AS) - The application server includes the
   conference policy server, the focus and the conference notification
   server as defined in draft-ietf-sipping-conferencing-framework.

   Media Server (MS) - The media server includes the mixer as defined in
   draft-ietf-sipping-conferencing-framework.  The media server source
   media streams for announcements, it process media streams for
   functions like DTMF detection and transcoding.  The media server may
   also record media streams for supporting IVR functions like
   announcing participants


3.  Requirements

3.1.  Media Control Requirements

   The following are the media control requirements:

   REQ-MCP-01 - There MUST be a requirement for a control protocol that
      will enable one or more Application Servers to control a media
      server.

Internet-Draft      Media Control Protocol Framework        October 2005


   REQ-MCP-02 The protocol MUST be independent from the transport.

   REQ-MCP-03 - The application scope of the protocol shall include
      Enhanced Conferencing Control and Interactive Voice Response, but
      exclude Speech Recognition and Text to Speech.

   REQ-MCP-04 - Media types that are supported in the context of the
      applications shall include audio, tones and video.

   REQ-MCP-05 - The protocol will utilize an XML markup language.

   REQ-MCP-06 - A Media Server SHOULD be application/service
      independent.  It should be possible to have a many-to-many
      relationship between Application Servers and Media Servers that
      use this protocol.

   REQ-MCP-07 - Though a proxy or Media Server Resource Broker may be
      used to determine which Media Server to route to, the solution
      will not mandate that there be a proxy and/or Media Server
      Resource Broker between the Application Server and Media Server.

   REQ-MCP-08 - A single conference-wide control channel shall be used
      between the AS and a MS (as opposed to per-call leg control
      channels), such that conference-wide, partially conference-wide
      and individual leg instructions can be identified.

   REQ-MCP-09 - On the control channel, there shall be commands to the
      MS and indications to the AS.

   REQ-MCP-10 - The media is sent via the Real Time Transport Protocol
      and goes to and from the edges.

   REQ-MCP-11 - SIP SHALL be used to establish and modify RTP
      connections to a Media Server.

   REQ-MCP-12 - It must be possible to support a single conference
      spanning multiple Media Servers.

   REQ-MCP-13 - It must be possible to move an existing conference from
      the current Media Servers supporting it to other Media Servers,
      where the latter have been identified to the AS.

   REQ-MCP-14 - It must be possible to split call legs individually or
      in groups away from a main conference on a given Media Server,
      without performing SIP re-establishment of the call legs to the
      MS(e.g., for purposes such as, performing IVR with a single call
      leg or creating sub-conferences).

Internet-Draft      Media Control Protocol Framework        October 2005


   REQ-MCP-15 - The AS-MS control protocol must allow the AS to query
      the MS for control state information and receive such information
      from it.

   REQ-MCP-16 - The protocol should be extendable.


4.  Security Considerations

   As an XML markup, all of the security considerations of RFC3023
   [RFC3023] and RFC3406 [RFC3406] must be met.  Pay particular
   attention to the robustness requirements of parsing XML.


5.  Changes from previous

   Not Applicable.
