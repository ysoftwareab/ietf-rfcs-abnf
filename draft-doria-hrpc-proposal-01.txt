     Proposal for research on human rights protocol considerations
                      draft-doria-hrpc-proposal-01

Abstract

   Work has been done on privacy issues that should be considered when
   creating an Internet protocol.  This draft suggests that similar
   considerations may apply for other human rights such as freedom of
   expression or freedom of association.  A proposal is made for work in
   the IRTF researching the possible connections between human rights
   and Internet standards and protocols.  The goal is to create an
   informational RFC concerning human rights protocol considerations.

1.  Introduction

   The recognition that human rights have a role in Internet policies is
   slowly becoming part of the general discourse.  Several reports from
   former United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the promotion and
   protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank
   La Rue, have made such relation explicit, which lead to the approval
   of the landmark resolution "on the promotion, protection and
   enjoyment of human rights on the Internet" [HRC2012] at the UN Human
   Rights Council (HRC).  More recently, to the resolution "The right to
   privacy in the digital age" [UNGA2013] at the UN General Assembly.
   The NETmundial outcome document [NETmundial]  affirms that human
   rights, as reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
   [UDHR], should underpin Internet governance principles.
   Nevertheless, a direct relation between Internet Standards and human
   rights is still something to be explored and more clearly evidenced.

Internet-Draft    Human Rights Protocol Considerations        March 2015


   Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong part
   of the world-view of the community involved in developing the first
   Internet protocols.  Apparently, by intention or by coincidence, the
   Internet was designed with freedom and openness of communications as
   core values.  But as the scale and the industrialization of the
   Internet has grown greatly, the influence of such world-views started
   to compete with other values.  The belief of the authors is that as
   the Internet continues to grow, the linkage of Internet protocols to
   human rights needs to become explicit, structured, and intentional.

   Standards and protocols form the basis of the human rights enabling
   infrastructure of the Internet.  It needs to be determined whether
   there is a causal relationship between Internet protocols and
   standards, and human rights such as freedom of expression.  To study
   the relationship between the two one would need to carefully consider
   structural and architectural considerations, as well as specific
   protocols.  The Internet Society paper "Human Rights and Internet
   Protocols" [HRIP] "explores human rights and Internet protocols
   comparing the processes for their making and the principles by which
   they operate and concludes that there are some shared principles
   between the two."  Though that paper does not go into possible
   reasons, dependencies or guidelines, it initiates the discussion.
   More research is needed to map human rights concerns to protocol
   elements and to frame possible approaches towards protocols that
   satisfy the implications of human rights standards.

   To move this debate further, a list has been created for discussion
   of this draft: hrpc@article19.io and related ideas - information or
   subscriptions at: https://lists.ghserv.net/mailman/listinfo/hrpc

1.1.  Requirements Language

   As this is an informational document describing a research effort, it
   will not make use of requirements language as defined in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  Research topic

   In a manner similar to the work done for RFC 6973 [RFC6973] on
   Privacy Consideration Guidelines, the premise of this research is
   that some standards and protocols can solidify, enable or threaten
   user rights.

   As stated in RFC 1958 [RFC1958], the Internet aims to be the global
   network of networks that provides unfettered connectivity to all
   users at all times and for any content.  Open, secure and reliable
   connectivity is essential for rights such as freedom of expression
   and freedom of association, as defined in the Universal Declaration



Doria, et al.          Expires September 10, 2015               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft    Human Rights Protocol Considerations        March 2015


   of Human Rights [UDHR].  Therefore, considering connectivity as the
   ultimate objective of the Internet, this makes a clear case that the
   Internet is not only an enabler of human rights, but that human
   rights lie at the basis of, and are ingrained in, the architecture of
   the network.

   An essential part of maintaining the Internet as a tool for
   communication and connectivity is security.  Indeed, "development of
   security mechanisms is seen as a key factor in the future growth of
   the Internet as a motor for international commerce and communication"
   RFC 1984 [RFC1984] and according to the Danvers Doctrine RFC 3365
   [RFC3365], there is an overwhelming consensus in the IETF that the
   best security should be used and standardized.

   In RFC 1984 [RFC1984], the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and the
   Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), the bodies which oversee
   architecture and standards for the Internet, expressed: "concern by
   the need for increased protection of international commercial
   transactions on the Internet, and by the need to offer all Internet
   users an adequate degree of privacy."  Indeed, the IETF has been
   doing a significant job in this area [RFC6973] [RFC7258], considering
   privacy concerns as a subset of security concerns.  [RFC6973]

   Besides privacy, it should be possible to highlight other aspects of
   connectivity embedded in standards and protocols that can have human
   rights considerations, such as freedom of expression and the right to
   association and assembly online.  This research is working to develop
   a methodology that enables us to extract these considerations.

2.1.  Protocol and Standard Examples

   Some initial topics that need exploration are indicated in this
   section.  Most of this work has yet to move beyond speculation and
   casual conversation.  Continuing releases of this draft will develop
   these foundational discussions further, based on discussions to be
   held on the hrpc@article19.io email list and the work of researchers
   working on the project.

2.1.1.  Architecture

   RFC 1958 [RFC1958]  mentions "the community believes that the goal
   [of the Internet] is connectivity, the tool is the Internet
   Protocol."  It continues a bit further: "The current exponential
   growth of the network seems to show that connectivity is its own
   reward, and is more valuable than any individual application such as
   mail or the World-Wide Web."  This marks the intrinsic value of
   connectivity, which is facilitated by the Internet, both in its
   principle, and in practice.  This shows that the underlying



Doria, et al.          Expires September 10, 2015               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    Human Rights Protocol Considerations        March 2015


   principles of the Internet aim to preserve connectivity, which is
   fundamental and similar to the part of Article 19 of the Universal
   Declaration of Human Rights [UDHR], which defines a right to receive
   and to impart information.

   Article 19
      Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this
      right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and
      to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any
      media and regardless of frontiers.

2.1.2.  Transparency

   Another part of Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
   Rights [UDHR] mentions that one has the right to hold opinions
   _without interference_ (emphasis added).  This same sentiment can be
   found in IAB RFC4924 [RFC4924] - Reflection on Internet Transparency
   where it states: "A network that does not filter or transform the
   data that it carries may be said to be transparent" or "oblivious" to
   the content of packets.  Networks that provide oblivious transport
   enable the deployment of new services without requiring changes to
   the core.  It is this flexibility that is perhaps both the Internet's
   most essential characteristic as well as one of the most important
   contributors to its success."

2.1.3.  HTTP

   Websites made it extremely easy for individuals to publish their
   ideas, opinions and thoughts.  Never before has the world seen an
   infrastructure that made it this easy to share information and ideas
   with such a large group of other people.  The HTTP architecture and
   standards, including RFC 7230 [RFC7230], RFC 7231 [RFC7231], RFC 7232
   [RFC7232], RFC 7234 [RFC7234], RFC 7235 [RFC7235], RFC 7236
   [RFC7236], and RFC 7327 [RFC7237], are essential for the publishing
   of information.  The HTTP protocol, therefore, forms an crucial
   enabler for freedom of expression, but also for the right to freely
   participate in the culture life of the community (Article 27) [UDHR],
   to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its
   benefits.

2.1.4.  Mailing lists

   Collaboration and cooperation have been part of the Internet since
   its early beginning, one of the instruments of facilitating working
   together in groups are mailing lists (as described in RFC 2369
   [RFC2919], RFC 2919 [RFC2919], and RFC 6783 [RFC6783].  Mailing lists
   are critical instruments and enablers for group communication and
   organization, and therefore form early artefacts of the



Doria, et al.          Expires September 10, 2015               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    Human Rights Protocol Considerations        March 2015


   (standardized) ability of Internet standards to enable the right to
   freedom of assembly and association.

2.1.5.  Real time communications

   Collaborations and cooperation via the Internet have take a large
   step forward with the progress of chat and other other real time
   communications protocols.  The work on XMPP RFC 6162 [RFC6162] has
   enabled new methods of global interactions, cooperation and human
   right advocacy.  The WebRTC work being done to standardize the API
   and protocol elements to support real-time communications for
   browsers, mobile applications and IoT by the World Wide Consortium
   (W3C) and the IETF is another artefact enabling human rights globally
   on the Internet.

2.1.6.  IDNs

   English has been the lingua franca of the Internet, but for many
   Internet user English is not their first language.  To have a true
   global Internet, one that serves the whole world, it would need to
   reflect the languages of these different communities.  The
   Internationalized Domain Names IDNA2008 (RFC 5890 [RFC5890], RFC 5891
   [RFC5891], RFC 5892 [RFC5892], and RFC 5893 [RFC5893]), describes
   standards for the use of a broad range of strings and characters
   (some also written from right to left).  This enables users who use
   other characters than the standard LDH ascii typeset to have their
   own URLs.  This shows the ambition of the Internet community to
   reflect the diversity of users and to be in line with Article 2 of
   the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which clearly stipulates
   that "everyone is entitles to all rights and freedoms [..], without
   distinction of any kind, such as [..] language [..]."[UDHR]

3.  Proposal

   To start addressing the issue, a mapping exercise analyzing Internet
   architecture and protocols features, vis-a-vis possible impact on
   human rights needs is being undertaken.

   As part of the research, interviews will be requested with the
   current and past members of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB),
   current and past members of the Internet Engineering Steering
   Group(IESG) and chairs of selected working groups and RFC authors.

   Mapping the relation between human rights and protocols and
   architectures is a new research challenge, which requires a good
   amount of cross organizational cooperation to develop a consistent
   methodology.  While the authors of this first draft are involved in
   both human rights advocacy and research on Internet technologies - we

   believe that bringing this work into the IRTF facilitates and
   improves this work by bringing human rights experts together with the
   community of researchers and developers of Internet standards and
   technologies.

   Assuming that the research produces useful results, the objective
   will evolve into the creation of a set of recommended considerations
   for the protection of applicable human rights.

3.1.  Working Assumptions

   In the analysis of existing RFCs central design and technical
   concepts have been found which impact human rights.  These concepts,
   working assumptions, will form the lens for the analysis of RFCs and
   will be further described vis a vis their impact on human rights.

   The combination of content agnosticism, connectivity, security (as
   defined in RFC 3365 [RFC3365] and privacy (as defined in RFC 6973
   [RFC6973]) are the technical principles that underlay freedom of
   expression on the Internet.

   Privacy and security are defined, so here we focus on concepts that
   have not been defined as considerations that are relevant for freedom
   of expression.

   This is a first list of concepts, which definitions should be
   improved and further aligned with existing RFCs.

   Connectivity:
      The Internet is the tool for providing global connectivity that
      conforms with RFC 1958 [RFC1958].  Therefore all protocols and
      standards should aim to improve connectivity, and not to limit it.

    Distributed:
      To enable and strengthen connectivity, stability, and
      sustainability of the network, protocols and standards should be
      developed in a way that can be implemented in a distributed way.
      If they are not instrumented in a distributed manner, other
      'accountability mechanisms' should be in place.  Accountability
      mechanisms might include features such as access control, logging
      and other protocol management.

   Inter-operable:
      Standards exist to design systems that allow for other systems to
      interact freely and openly.

   Reliable:




Doria, et al.          Expires September 10, 2015               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft    Human Rights Protocol Considerations        March 2015


      Reliability ensures that a protocol will execute its function
      consistently and error resistant as described and function without
      unexpected result.  This includes factors such as throughput,
      middle boxes, and delay/disruption tolerance.  A system that is
      reliable degenerates gracefully and will have a documented way to
      announce degradation.  It will also have mechanisms to recover
      from failure.

   Scalable:
      Any solution should support growth of the network with more hosts,
      users and traffic.  And have clear definition of its scope and
      ideally a proposition how it can be expanded in order to support
      greater capacity.  Any limits in scalability should be defined.

   Stateless  / state-full:
      If possible protocols should be implemented stateless for
      reliability and privacy considerations.  If not, they should keep
      as little state as possible.

   Content agnostic:
      Protocols should not treat packets/datagrams differently based on
      their content.

   Transparent:
      Protocols should be transparent in what they can do and can not do
      and how it is done.

   Debugging:
      A protocol should allow a user to troubleshoot and debug possible
      causes of malfunction and loss of reliability.

   Robust:
      Protocols should be resistant to errors, and to involuntary, legal
      or malicious attempts to disrupt its mode of operations.
      Protocols should be developed in a way that there is no hidden
      back doors or kill switches.  There should also be a clear
      description on how a protocol recovers from potential failures.

   End user-centric  / representing stakeholder rights:
      As proposed in draft-nottingham-stakeholder-rights-00:

         Protocols MUST document relevant primary stakeholders and their
         interrelationships.  [..]

         End-user-facing application protocols MUST prioritise their
         users higher than any other stakeholders.

Internet-Draft    Human Rights Protocol Considerations        March 2015


         Extensions to existing protocols MUST document how they
         interact with the extended protocol's stakeholders.  If the
         extended protocol's stakeholders are not yet documented, the
         extension MAY estimate its impact, in coordination with that
         protocol's community and the IESG.

         The burden of this documentation need not be high; if HTML can
         do it in a paragraph, so can most protocols.  While it might be
         appropriate in a separate document (e.g., a requirements or use
         cases draft) or the protocol specification itself, documenting
         stakeholders in the WG charter has considerable benefits, since
         it clarifies their relationships up-front.
