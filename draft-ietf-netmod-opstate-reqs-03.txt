Terminology and Requirements for Enhanced Handling of Operational State
                   draft-ietf-netmod-opstate-reqs-03

Abstract

   This document primarily regards the difference between the intended
   configuration and the applied configuration of a device and how
   intended and applied configuration relate to the operational state of
   a device.  This document defines requirements for the applied
   configuration's data model and its values, as well as for enabling a
   client to know when a configuration has been fully applied or not,
   how to access operational state, and how to relate intended
   configuration nodes to applied configuration and derived state nodes.

1.  Introduction

   This document primarily regards the difference between the intended
   configuration and the applied configuration of a device and how
   intended and applied configuration relate to the operational state of
   a device.  This document defines requirements for the applied
   configuration's data model and its values, as well as for enabling a
   client to know when a configuration has been fully applied or not,
   how to access operational state, and how to relate intended
   configuration nodes to applied configuration and derived state nodes.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The term "client" is used throughout this document to refer to what
   is many times known as the "application" or "network management
   system".  This definition is intended to be consistent with the term
   "client" defined in [RFC6241], Section 1.1, but independent of any
   association to a particular protocol.

   The term "server" is used throughout this document to refer to what
   is many times known as the "device", "system", or "network element".
   This definition is intended to be consistent with the term "server"
   defined in [RFC6241], Section 1.1, but independent of any association
   to a particular protocol.

Internet-DraftTerms and Reqs for OpState Enhanced Handling  January 2016


   This document defines the following terms:

   Applied Configuration:  This data represents the configuration state
       that the server is actually in.  That is, the configuration state
       which is currently being used by server components (e.g., control
       plane daemons, operating system kernels, line cards).  With
       respect to NETCONF architecture, the applied configuration
       resides in the "system software component" box listed on page 15
       of [RFC6244]

          NOTE: The server's ability to report applied configuration
          accurately may be limited in some cases, such as when the
          configuration goes through an intermediate layer without an
          ability to inspect the lower layer.

   Asynchronous Configuration Operation:  A configuration request to
       update the running configuration of a server that is applied
       asynchronously with respect to the client request.  The server
       MUST update its intended configuration (see term) before replying
       to the client indicating whether the request will be processed.
       This reply to the client only indicates whether there are any
       errors in the original request.  The server's applied
       configuration state (see term) is updated after the configuration
       change has been fully effected to all impacted components in the
       server.  Once applied, there MUST be a mechanism for the client
       to determine when the request has completed processing and
       whether the intended config is now fully effective or there are
       any errors from applying the configuration change, which could be
       from an asynchronous notification or via a client operation.

   Derived State:  This data represents information which is generated
       as part of the server's own interactions.  For example, derived
       state may consist of the results of protocol interactions (the
       negotiated duplex state of an Ethernet link), statistics (such as
       message queue depth), or counters (such as packet input or output
       bytes).

   Intended Configuration:  This data represents the configuration state
       that the network operator intends the server to be in, and that
       has been accepted by the server as valid configuration.  With
       respect to NETCONF architecture, the intended configuration is
       captured by the "config database" box listed on page 15 of
       [RFC6244]

   Operational State:  Operational State is the current state of the
       system as known to the various components of the system (e.g.,
       control plane daemons, operating system kernels, line cards).

Internet-DraftTerms and Reqs for OpState Enhanced Handling  January 2016


       The operational state includes both applied configuration and
       derived state.

   Synchronous Configuration Operation:  A configuration request to
       update the running configuration of a server that is applied
       synchronously with respect to the client request (i.e. a blocking
       call).  The server MUST fully attempt to apply the configuration
       change to all impacted components in the server, updating both
       the server's intended and applied configuration (see terms),
       before replying to the client.  The reply to the client indicates
       whether there are any errors in the request or errors from
       applying the configuration change.

3.  Backwards Compatibility

   Any solution satisfying the requirements specified in this document
   MUST ensure backwards compatibility with regards to existing
   deployments.  Specifically, it MUST be possible to upgrade a server
   to one that supports the solution without breaking existing/legacy
   clients.  Likewise, it MUST be possible for a client that has been
   coded to support the solution to interoperate appropriately with
   existing/legacy servers.

4.  Requirements

   1.  Ability to interact with both intended and applied configuration

       A.  The ability to ask the operational components of a server
           (e.g., line cards) for the configuration that they are
           currently using.  This is the applied configuration (see
           term).

       B.  Applied configuration is read-only

       C.  The data model for the applied configuration is the same as
           the data model for the intended configuration (same leaves)

       D.  When a configuration change for any intended configuration
           node has been successfully applied to the server (e.g. not
           failed, nor deferred due to absent hardware) then the
           existence and value of the corresponding applied
           configuration node must match the intended configuration
           node.

   2.  Support for both synchronous and asynchronous configuration
       operations (see terms)

       A.  A server may support only synchronous configuration
           operations, or only asynchronous configuration operations, or
           both synchronous and asynchronous configuration operations on
           a client-specified per-operation basis.

       B.  Servers that support asynchronous configuration operations
           MAY also provide a verify operation that a client can request
           from the server to return information regarding the
           difference between the intended and applied configurations.

       C.  The configuration protocol MUST specify how configuration
           errors are handled.  Errors MAY be handled by semantics
           similar to NETCONF's error-options for the <edit-config>
           operation (stop-on-error, continue-on-error, rollback-on-
           error), as described in Section 7.2 in [RFC6241], but
           extended to incorporate both the intended and applied
           configurations.  Support for "rollback on error" semantics
           SHOULD be provided.

   3.  Separation of the applied configuration and derived state aspects
       of operational state; ability to retrieve them independently and
       together

       A.  Be able to retrieve only the applied configuration aspects of
           operational state

       B.  Be able to retrieve only the derived state aspects of
           operational state

       C.  Be able to retrieve both the applied configuration and
           derived state aspects of operational state together

   4.  Ability to relate configuration with its corresponding
       operational state

       A.  Ability to map intended config nodes to corresponding applied
           config nodes

       B.  Ability to map intended config nodes to associated derived
           state nodes

       C.  The mappings needs to be programmatically consumable

5.  Security Considerations

   It is understood that the intended and applied configurations will
   differ while synchronization is in progress.  During the
   synchronization process, the server will be in an inconsistent state

   from the client's perspective.  Implementations need to take care to
   ensure that this process minimizes gaps in the application of
   security policy (e.g., replacing a firewall policy in a single step).
   Implementations additionally need to ensure that any gaps in security
   policies are not dependent on external input that an attacker might
   be able to control or prevent access to.

6.  IANA Considerations

   None
