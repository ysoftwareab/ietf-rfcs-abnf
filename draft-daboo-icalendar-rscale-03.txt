Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions           March 2014


1.  Introduction

   The iCalendar [RFC5545] data format is in widespread use to represent
   calendar data. iCalendar represents dates and times using the
   Gregorian calendar system only.  It does provide a way to use non-
   Gregorian calendar systems via a "CALSCALE" property, however this
   has never been formally used.  However, there is a need to support at
   least non-Gregorian recurrence patterns to cover anniversaries, and
   many local, religious, or civil holidays based on non-Gregorian
   dates.

   There are several disadvantages to using the existing "CALSCALE"
   property in iCalendar for implementing non-Gregorian calendars:

   1.  The "CALSCALE" property exists in the top-level "VCALENDAR"
       objects and thus applies to all components within that object.
       In today's multi-cultural society, that restricts the ability to
       mix events from different calendar systems within the same
       iCalendar object. e.g., it would prevent having both the
       Gregorian New Year and Chinese New Year in the same iCalendar
       object.

   2.  Many countries observe daylight savings time, encoded in
       iCalendar using the "VTIMEZONE" component.  Timezone and daylight
       saving time rules are always specified via Gregorian calendar
       based recurrence rules (e.g., "the 3rd Sunday in March").  This
       is problematic for non-Gregorian uses of "CALSCALE" which would
       by default also apply to the dates and rules used in the
       "VTIMEZONE" components in the corresponding iCalendar object.

   This specification solves these issues by allowing the "CALSCALE" to
   remain set to Gregorian, but re-defining the recurrence rule property
   "RRULE" to accept new items including one that allows non-Gregorian
   calendar systems to be used.  With this, all the date, time and
   period values in the iCalendar object would remain specified using
   the Gregorian calendar system, but repeating patterns in other
   calendar systems could be defined.  It is then up to calendar user
   agents and servers to map between Gregorian and non-Gregorian
   calendar systems in order to expand out recurrence instances.

   This specification does not itself define calendar systems, rather it
   utilizes the registry defined by the Unicode Consortium
   (http://unicode.org) in their CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository)
   project.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The notation used in this memo is the ABNF notation of [RFC5234] as
   used by iCalendar [RFC5545].  Any syntax elements shown below that
   are not explicitly defined in this specification come from iCalendar
   [RFC5545], iTIP [RFC5546], and CalDAV [RFC4791].

   When XML element types in the namespaces "DAV:" and
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav" are referenced in this document
   outside of the context of an XML fragment, the string "DAV:" and
   "CALDAV:" will be prefixed to the element type names respectively.

   When a Gregorian calendar date value is shown in text, it will use
   the format "YYYYMMHH", where "YYYY" is the 4-digit year, "MM" the
   2-digit month, and "DD" the 2-digit day (this is the same format used
   in iCalendar [RFC5545]).  The Chinese calendar will be used as an
   example of a non-Gregorian calendar for illustrative purposes.  When
   a Chinese calendar date value is shown in text, it will use the
   format "{C}YYYYMM[L]DD" - i.e., the same format as Gregorian but with
   a "{C}" prefix, and an optional "L" character after the month element
   to indicate a leap month.  Similarly, {I} and {H} are used in other
   examples as prefixes for Islamic (Civil) and Hebrew dates,
   respectively.  Note that the Chinese calendar years shown in the
   examples are based on the Unicode (ICU) library's Chinese calendar
   epoch.  Whilst there are several different Chinese calendar epochs in
   common use, the choice of one over another does not impact the actual
   calculation of the Gregorian equivalent dates, provided conversion is
   always done using the same epoch.


3.  Overview

   In the Gregorian calendar system, each year is composed of a fixed
   number of months (12), with each month having a fixed number of days
   (between 30 and 31), except for the second month (February) which
   contains either 28 days, or 29 days (in a leap year).  Weeks are
   composed of 7 days, with day names Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
   Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Years can have either 365 or
   366 days (the later in a leap year).  The number of whole weeks in a
   year is 52.

   In iCalendar, the "RECUR" value type defines various fields used to
   express a recurrence pattern, and those fields are given limits based



Daboo & Yakushev       Expires September 16, 2014               [Page 4]

   on those of the Gregorian calendar system.  Since other calendar
   systems can have different limits and other behaviors that need to be
   accounted for, the maximum values for the elements in the "RECUR"
   value are not covered by this specification.

   To generate a set of recurring instances in a non-Gregorian calendar
   system, the following procedure is used:

   1.  iCalendar data continues to use the "GREGORIAN" calendar system,
       so all "DATE", "DATE-TIME" and "PERIOD" values continue to use
       the Gregorian format and limits.

   2.  The "RRULE" property is extended to include an "RSCALE" element
       in its value that specifies the calendar system to use for the
       recurrence pattern.  The existing elements of the "RRULE" value
       type are used, but modified to support different upper limits,
       based on the "RSCALE" value, as well as a modification to month
       numbers to allow a leap month to be specified.  Existing
       requirements for the use of "RRULE" all still apply (e.g., the
       "RRULE" has to match the "DTSTART" value of the master instance).
       Other recurrence properties such as "RECURRENCE-ID", "RDATE" and
       "EXDATE" continue to use the Gregorian date format as "CALSCALE"
       is unchanged.

   When generating instances, the following procedure might be used:

   1.  Convert the "DTSTART" property value of the master recurring
       component into the date and time components for the calendar
       system specified by the "RSCALE" element in the "RRULE" value.
       This provides the "seed" value for generating subsequent
       recurrence instances.

   2.  Iteratively generate instances using the "RRULE" value applied to
       the year, month, and day components of the date in the new
       calendar system.

   3.  For each generated instance, convert the date values back from
       the non-Gregorian form into Gregorian and use those values for
       other properties such as "RECURRENCE-ID".

   Consider the following example for an event representing the Chinese
   New Year:

   DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20130210
   RRULE:RSCALE=CHINESE;FREQ=YEARLY
   SUMMARY:Chinese New Year

   To generate instances, first the "DTSTART" value "20130210" is

   converted into the Chinese calendar system giving "{C}46500101".
   Next, the year component is incremented by one to give "{C}46510101",
   and that is then converted back into Gregorian as "20140131".
   Additional instances are generated by iteratively increasing the year
   component in the Chinese date value and converting back to Gregorian.

   This specification makes use of calendar algorithms defined by the
   Unicode Consortium [TBD - reference].  The definition of different
   calendar scales is defined by Unicode, as per Section 5.


4.  Extended RRULE Property

   This specification extends the existing "RRULE" iCalendar property
   value to include a new "RSCALE" element that can be used to indicate
   the calendar system used for generating the recurrence pattern.

   When "RSCALE" is present, the other changes to "RRULE" are:

   1.  Elements that include numeric values (e.g., "BYYEARDAY") have
       numeric ranges defined by the "RSCALE" value (i.e., in some
       calendar systems there might be more than 366 days in a year).

   2.  Month numbers can include an "L" suffix to indicate that the
       specified month is a leap month in the corresponding calendar
       system.

   3.  Month numbers can be specified using a negative offset (i.e.,
       "-1" represents the last month of the year).

   4.  A "SKIP" element is added to define how "missing" instances are
       handled. e.g., if a yearly recurring event starts in a leap
       month, the "SKIP" element determines whether instances in non-
       leap years are ignored ("SKIP" set to "YES"), appear in the
       preceding regular month ("SKIP" set to "BACKWARD" - the default
       when "RSCALE" is present), or appear in the following regular
       month ("SKIP" set to "FORWARD").  The "SKIP" processing is done
       after all other rule elements except for "COUNT" and "UNTIL" have
       been processed.

   The syntax for the "RECUR" value is modified in the following
   fashion:

   recur-rule-part /=   ("RSCALE" "=" rscale)
                      / ("SKIP" "=" skip)

   rscale          = (iana-token  ; A CLDR-registered calendar system
                                  ; name.
                    / x-name)     ; A non-standard, experimental
                                  ; calendar system name.

   skip            = ("YES" / "BACKWARD" / "FORWARD")
                    ; When "RSCALE" is not present the default
                    ; is "YES". When "RSCALE" is present the default
                    ; is "BACKWARD".

   monthnum        = [plus / minus] 1*2DIGIT  ["L"]
                    ; Existing element modified to include a positive
                    ; or negative offset capability, as well as a leap
                    ; month indicator suffix.


4.1.  Handling Leap Months

   Leap months can occur in different calendar systems.  For most of
   those, the suffix "L" is added to the "RRULE" month number component
   to indicate a leap month.  In some cases the month precedes the
   regular month with the same number, in other cases it follows.  The
   one exception to this rule is the Hebrew calendar, where we follow
   the definition from Unicode [TBD - REF].  In that case months are
   number 1 through 13, with month 6 being the leap month.  Thus in non-
   leap years, month 6 is skipped.

4.2.  Examples

4.2.1.  Chinese New Year

   Consider the following set of iCalendar properties:

   DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20130210
   RRULE:RSCALE=CHINESE;FREQ=YEARLY
   SUMMARY:Chinese New Year

   These define a recurring event for the Chinese New Year, with the
   first instance the one in Gregorian year 2013.

   The Chinese date corresponding to the first instance is {C}46500101.
   The table below shows the initial instance, and the next four, each
   of which is determined by adding the appropriate amount to the year
   component of the Chinese date.  Also shown is the conversion back to
   the Gregorian date:

4.2.2.  Islamic Civil Start of Ramadan

   Consider the following set of iCalendar properties:

   DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20130709
   RRULE:RSCALE=ISLAMIC-CIVIL;FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=9
   SUMMARY:Start of Ramadan

   These define a recurring event for the start of the Islamic month of
   Ramadan, with the first instance the one in Gregorian year 2013.

   The Islamic date corresponding to the first instance is {I}14340901.
   The table below shows the initial instance, and the next four, each
   of which is determined by adding the appropriate amount to the year
   component of the Islamic date.  Also shown is the conversion back to
   the Gregorian date:

     +--------------+------------------------------------------------+
     | Islamic Date | Gregorian Date                                 |
     +--------------+------------------------------------------------+
     | {I}14340901  | 20130709 - DTSTART specified in iCalendar data |
     | {I}14350901  | 20140629                                       |
     | {I}14360901  | 20150618                                       |
     | {I}14370901  | 20160607                                       |

     +--------------+------------------------------------------------+

   Note that in this example, the value of the "BYMONTH" component in
   the "RRULE" matches the Islamic month value and not the Gregorian
   month.

4.2.3.  Hebrew anniversary starting in a leap month

   Consider the following set of iCalendar properties:

   These define a recurring event for the 8th day of the Hebrew month of
   Adar I, with the first instance the one in Gregorian year 2014.

   The Hebrew date corresponding to the first instance is {H}57740608,
   note that month 6 is a leap month in year 5774.  The table below
   shows the initial instance, and the next four, each of which is
   determined by adding the appropriate amount to the year component of
   the Hebrew date, taking into account that only year 5776 is a leap
   year.  Thus in other years the Hebrew month component is adjusted
   forward to month 7.  Also shown is the conversion back to the
   Gregorian date:

     | {H}57770708 | 20170306                                       |
     | {H}57780708 | 20180223                                       |

5.  Registering Calendar Systems

   This specification uses the Unicode Consortium's registry of calendar
   systems [UNICODE.CLDR] to define valid values for the "RSCALE"
   element of an "RRULE".  Note that the underscore character "_" is
   never used in CLDR-based calendar system names.  New values can be
   added to this registry following Unicode Consortium rules.  It is
   expected that many implementations of non-Gregorian calendars will
   use software libraries provided by Unicode (ICU), and hence it makes
   sense to re-use their registry rather than creating a new one.  For
   consistency, when used, the "RSCALE" values SHOULD be uppercased.

   CLDR supports the use of "alias" values as alternative names for
   specific calendar systems.  These alias values MUST be treated as
   valid "RSCALE" element values.

   When using the CLDR data, calendar agents SHOULD take into account
   the "deprecated" value and use the alternative "preferred" calendar
   system.  In particular, the "islamicc" calendar system is considered
   deprecated in favor of the "islamic-civil" calendar system.


6.  Use with iTIP

   iTIP [RFC5546] defines how iCalendar data can be sent between

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions           March 2014


   calendar user agents to schedule calendar components between calendar
   users.  It is often not possible to know the capabilities of a
   calendar user agent to which an iTIP message is being sent, but iTIP
   defines fallback behavior in such cases.

   For calendar user agents that do not support the "RSCALE" element,
   the following can occur when iTIP messages containing an "RSCALE"
   element are received:

      The receiving calendar user agent can reject the entire iTIP
      message and return an iTIP reply with a "REQUEST-STATUS" property
      set to the "3.1" status code (as per Section 3.6.14 of [RFC5546]).

      The receiving calendar user agent can fallback to a non-recurring
      behavior for the calendar component (effectively ignoring the
      "RRULE" property) and return an iTIP reply with a "REQUEST-STATUS"
      property set to the "2.3", "2.5", "2.8", or "2.10" status codes
      (as per Sections 3.6.3, 3.6.6, 3.6.9, or 3.6.11, respectively, of
      [RFC5546]).

   For calendar user agents that support the "RSCALE" element but do not
   support the calendar system specified by the "RSCALE" element value,
   the following can occur:

      the iTIP message SHOULD be rejected, returning a "REQUEST-STATUS"
      property set to the "3.1" status code (as per Section 3.6.14 of
      [RFC5546]).

      if the iTIP message is accepted and the calendar component treated
      as non-recurring, an iTIP reply with a "REQUEST-STATUS" property
      set to the "2.8" or "2.10" status codes (as per Sections 3.6.9 or
      3.6.11, respectively, of [RFC5546]) SHOULD be returned.


7.  Use with CalDAV

   The CalDAV [RFC4791] calendar access protocol allows clients and
   server to exchange iCalendar data.  In addition, CalDAV clients are
   able to query calendar data stored on the server, including time-
   based queries.  Since an "RSCALE" element value determines the time
   ranges for recurring instances in a calendar component, CalDAV
   servers need to support it to interoperate with clients also using
   the "RSCALE" element.

   A CalDAV server advertises a CALDAV:supported-rscale-set WebDAV
   property on calendar home or calendar collections if it supports use
   of "RSCALE" element as described in this specification.  The server
   can advertise a specific set of supported calendar systems by

Internet-Draft        iCalendar Property Extensions           March 2014


   including one or more CALDAV:supported-rscale XML elements within the
   CALDAV:supported-rscale-set XML element.  If no CALDAV:supported-
   rscale XML elements are included in the WebDAV property, then clients
   can try any calendar system value, but need to be prepared for a
   failure when attempting to store the calendar data.

   Clients MUST NOT attempt to store iCalendar data containing "RSCALE"
   elements if the CALDAV:supported-rscale-set WebDAV property is not
   advertised by the server.

   The server SHOULD return an HTTP 403 response with a DAV:error
   element containing a CALDAV:supported-rscale XML element, if a client
   attempts to store iCalendar data with an "RSCALE" element value not
   supported by the server.

   It is possible for a "RSCALE" value to be present in calendar data on
   the server being accessed by a client that does not support an
   "RSCALE" element or its specified value.  It is expected that
   existing clients, unaware of "RSCALE", will fail gracefully by
   ignoring the calendar component, whilst still processing other
   calendar data on the server.

7.1.  CALDAV:supported-rscale-set Property

   Name:  supported-rscale-set

   Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:caldav

   Purpose:  Enumerates the set of supported iCalendar "RSCALE" element
      values supported by the server.

   Protected:  This property MUST be protected and SHOULD NOT be
      returned by a PROPFIND allprop request (as defined in Section 14.2
      of [RFC4918]).

   Description:  See above.

   Definition:

   <!ELEMENT supported-rscale-set (supported-rscale*) >
   <!ELEMENT supported-rscale (#PCDATA)>
   <!-- PCDATA value: string -->
