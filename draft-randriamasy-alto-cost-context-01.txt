Abstract

   The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Service has defined
   network and cost maps to provide basic network information, where the
   cost maps allow only one JSON value for a requested metric.

   This document introduces several protocol extensions to allow ALTO
   clients to support use cases such as context based connection
   selection in cellular networks and calendaring for unattended data.
   This document refers to other extension proposals posted in the ALTO
   WG that can support the present use cases as well.  Likewise, some of
   the proposed extensions may serve other ALTO use cases.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title                 March 2017


1.  Introduction

   The IETF ALTO protocol specified in [RFC7285] provides guidance to
   over the top applications which have to select one or several hosts
   or endpoints from a set of candidates that are able to provide a
   desired data resource, or which need some provider-centric insight on
   the cost of application paths to these endhosts.  The ALTO Service
   has defined network and cost maps to provide basic network
   information, where the cost maps allow only one JSON value for a
   requested metric.

   This draft brings a use case where providing different values for a
   same cost metric can help in optimizing the application path
   selection.  Typically, when an end host can connect to the network
   via multiple technologies or access points, the path performance for
   a metric may be accordingly impacted.

   The present draft proposes to extend the cost information specified
   in [RFC7285] by providing, for a same cost metric, several possible
   cost values.  Which value to provide depends on qualitative criteria
   as opposed to quantitative criteria such as time.  The purpose is to
   allow a finer grained decision on which application endpoint or sub
   network to access.

   Previous ALTO WG discussions have suggested to introduce "the ability
   to "name" cost maps so that a single Information Resource Directory
   can link multiple cost maps with the same cost type to a single
   network map."  The goal was to provide, for a given cost metric,
   multiple cost values depending on qualitative conditions named
   "circumstance", where a circumstance reflects a given policy.

   For applications such as video download or streaming, a user
   equipment (UE) may use [RFC7285] to choose the best possible
   application resource location.

   Currently, the insight of ALTO information on the path between a UE
   and a connection node (or say Endpoint) does not provide details
   below IP hops.  However the major QoE challenges of wireless network
   users arise in the access network, that is, in the first hop between
   the UE and its one or more serving packet data network gateway (PGW).
   The path of a UE to its serving PGW(s) impacts the path to the
   content and thus the related QoE.  Therefore, it is necessary to
   inform the UE, which could take the appropriate decisions w.r.t. the
   utilized access path.  The access technology in current ALTO
   documents is accounted at the content location (last hop) side by
   distinguishing whether the requested content is located in a fixed or
   a wireless access network, as described in
   [draft-ietf-alto-deployment]

   This document introduces several protocol extensions to allow ALTO
   clients to support use cases such as context-based connection
   selection in cellular networks and calendaring for unattended data.
   This document refers to other extension proposals posted in the ALTO
   WG that can support the present use cases as well.  Likewise, some of
   the proposed extensions may serve other ALTO use cases.

2.  Use cases

   This section presents motivating use cases for contextual ALTO Costs
   with a focus on conditional RF costs in cellular networks.  In these
   2 use cases, a terminal UE is located in a LTE network and associated
   to a "local" ALTO Server(LAOS) that covers this access network, say
   up to the Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway PGW and can itself
   connect to another ALTO Server having a more global view covering up
   to the whole ISP network.  Such a deployment is proposed in section
   Section 5 of this draft.

2.1.  Use Case 1: conditional RF costs in cellular networks

   Let's assume a terminal UE located in a cellular network.  An ALTO
   Client (LAOC) associated to the UE queries the local ALTO Server in
   order to know via which cell it should connect to the network.  So in
   a first place, LAOC will query the connection cost associated to
   cells C1,.. CK.  This example assumes that this cost is a unitless
   value abstracting a (RF) cost to a cell.  Our example however
   includes 2 additional considerations:

   - the RF cost to a cell may be impacted by its load,

   - a UE usually transmits a fair amount of "unattended data" (UD).

   UD is considered in one of the key features for LTE enhancements in
   Release 13 and defined in 3GPP TS22.101 as follows: "Unattended Data
   Traffic : Data traffic of which the user is unaware he/she initiated,
   e.g. based on the screen/keypad lock being activated, length of time
   since the UE last received any input from the user, known type of app
   (e.g. an application monitoring a user's health "mHealth" may need
   its data never treated as Unattended Data Traffic.)".  UD traffic is
   often delay tolerant and it would be beneficial for the network if
   the UE can schedule its transmission.  To this end, the UE can use an
   instant UD Indicator (UDI) sent by the LTE network.  The UDI,
   accepted for LTE Release 13 is a single bit sent to the UE indicating
   whether UD in a cell is allowed (UDA) or not (UDNA).  The status
   change of a UDI from UDA to UDNA is presumably triggered when the
   cell load exceeds a given threshold T(udna).  The value of T(udna)
   may change across cells and in time but is not provided to UEs.  If
   the UE had an ALTO calendar for either T(udna) or for the abstracted



Randriamasy            Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title                 March 2017


   cell load values, it could appropriately schedule the transmission of
   its UD, that will have to occur anyway.  The UE could combine this
   calendar with the UDI it receives from the cellular network.  The UDI
   state may change within sub-seconds and impact the data exchange.
   What is missing in the provided LTE information is:

   - knowing whether the UDI threshold relates to downlink or uplink
   congestion.

   - knowing the level of congestion that triggers a change in UDI and
   how it may evolve in time.

   The UE thus can advatageously combine the non-real time ALTO
   information with the real-time UDI provided by the LTE network.  The
   present draft illustrates how ALTO can fill these gaps with the
   support of:

   - ALTO Cost Calendars,

   - the proposed protocol extension providing context-dependent ALTO
   Cost values.

   In this use case: ALTO calendars need to be requested via for the
   ALTO Filtered Cost Map (FCM) Service, the context parameters
   impacting the cost values are: "uda" (Unattended Data Allowed),
   "udna" (Unattended Data Not Allowed), "uplink", "downlink".

2.2.  Use case 2: access-aware endpoint selection

   In a second use case, an end-system called UEP is located in a LTE
   network and may connect via several access technologies, e.g.
   Cellular or WiFi.  UEP may also benefit from a given Service Level
   Agreement SLA-m.  Other parameters may characterize the UEP generated
   traffic.

   Currently the insight of ALTO information in the path between a UE
   and a connection node (or say Endpoint) does not provide details
   below IP hops.  However the major QoE challenges of wireless network
   users arise in the access network, that is, in the first hop between
   the UE and its one or more serving packet data network gateway (PGW).
   The path of a UE to its serving PGW(s) impacts the path to the
   content and thus the related QoE.  Therefore, it is necessary to
   inform the UE, which could take the appropriate decisions w.r.t. the
   utilized access path.  The access technology in current ALTO
   proposals is accounted at the content location (last hop) side by
   distinguishing whether the requested content is located in a fixed or
   a wireless access network, as described in [draft-ietf-alto-
   deployments] that states: "For ISPs with mobile network and fixed



Randriamasy            Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title                 March 2017


   network, the traffic optimizing problems they focus will be
   optimizing the mobile traffic, except problems on last hop section."

   For Mobile Network Operators (MNO) and their users, being connected
   via e.g. cellular or trusted Wifi can hugely impact the QoE and
   routing cost.  Sometimes a 4G connection is preferable for users than
   a poor WiFi connection although potentially more expensive.
   Sometimes, MNOs have spare data resources or offer them for given
   SLAs.  For both parties, access-aware Endpoint selection for Users is
   thus beneficial.  One way to achieve this is that ALTO provides cost
   values depending on qualitative contextual parameters such as access
   technology and the access technology and SLA.

3.  Required ALTO extensions

   The aforementionned use cases can be supported with a few simple
   extensions to the ALTO protocol.  A number of them have already been
   discussed in other WG drafts and use cases.  The proposed extensions
   include:

   - Cost value context parameters: a capability to allow exposing
   several possible context-dependent values for one metric, as proposed
   in the present document,

   - Entities with associated domain and properties for cellular and
   wireless networks, that could be added to
   [draft-roome-alto-unified-props],

   - Cost metrics for cellular and wireless networks: these features
   would extend current proposals in the WG,that could be added to
   [draft-ietf-alto-performance-metrics],

   - Extended input for the Filtered Cost Map Service: to allow the
   input to comprise several(source-array, destination-array) pairs, as
   it has been proposed in [draft-yang-alto-path-vector].

4.  Design options and examples

   Similarly to Multi-Cost and Cost Calendar (
   [draft-ietf-alto-cost-calendar]), this proposal does not introduce
   new cost modes or new media-types.  It ensures backwards
   compatibility with legacy ALTO Clients, that is: "A legacy ALTO
   Client must be able to send legacy requests to a Cost Context aware
   ALTO Server and get legacy responses as specified in RFC7285".

   "A Cost Context aware ALTO Server must be able to receive and process
   requests sent by legacy ALTO Clients, as specified in RFC 7285".

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title                 March 2017


   Besides, the proposed extension is designed to be compatible with
   Multi-Cost ALTO and ALTO Cost Calendars
   ([draft-ietf-alto-cost-calendar]).

   In the present draft version, the IRD indicates the supported context
   parameters as values encoded in JSON strings.  The idea is that this
   design simplifies the transactions, as it applies to context
   attributes that take a limited number of values, say 1 to 5.  Context
   attributes taking numerous or unpredictible values should be handled
   as values properties or metrics expressed in constraints.

4.1.  Overview of context features

   Cost context attributes are strings with values such as "wifi",
   "cellular", "uda".

   Cost context attributes are indicated in the IRD as capabilities of
   an information resource.  They are associated to cost type names.

4.1.1.  Applicable ALTO services

   Draft [draft-bertz-alto-mobilitynets] proposes to identify network
   points of attachment (PoA) such as cells to PIDs, as PoAs are
   endpoint types not currently supported in ALTO.  The current proposal
   is to represent cellular PIDs in an ALTO Network Map with no routes.
   PID properties as specified in [draft-roome-alto-unified-props] could
   be used to indicate the type of the PoA, together with other
   properties.  ALTO properties are well suited for almost static
   attributes such as access type.

   To indicate connection properties with frequently changing values
   such as RF Cost, load or congestion, the ALTO Filtered Cost Map
   service can be used.  Connection properties may also be conveyed with
   the Endpoint property service or its extensions defined in
   [draft-roome-alto-unified-props].

   Costs and properties with the extensions proposed in this document
   may be conveyed with different values depending on the context
   parameter.  The present version of this draft focuses on context
   patrameters associated to costs.

4.2.  Example IRD

   The purpose of ALTO is to guide the behavior of the end systems or
   applications without the need for networks to explicitely expose
   their performance values.  In this example, the IRD does not expose
   the real load percentage of a cell to UE.  Instead, it abstracts the
   cell congestion by a metric called 'RFcost' represented by a number



Randriamasy            Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title                 March 2017


   between 0 and 100.  The values of 'RFcost' are provided as a an ALTO
   Calendar as specified in [draft-ietf-alto-cost-calendar-00] in
   shorter time intervals.  In addition they differ, depending on the
   the context values "uda" and "udna".

   Besides, the IRD provides metric 'routingcost' as a MUST specfied in
   [RFC7285], that may represent a more administrative or monetary
   access cost.

   The IRD could publish the capability of a resource to provide context
   dependent 'routingcost' values as expressed for resource "filtered-
   cost-calendar-map".

4.3.  Use case 1: Example scenario for the FCM Service

   We assume an example scenario where a UE has the choice to connect to
   2 cells C1 and C2.

   As suggested in [draft-bertz-alto-mobilitynets], we may represent the
   cellular topology with an ALTO Network Map comprising PIDs
   representing the cells and named "Cell1", "Cell2", ... "Celln".  A
   format for a cell identifier has been proposed in
   [draft-rauschenbach-alto-wireless-access] and is not being discussed
   here.

   As a Network Map may cover a large number of cells, the Filtered Cost
   Map Service can be used to reduce data exchange and get information
   on a restricted number of cells, say PID1 and PID2.

   We assume that the ALTO Client in the UE wants to get calendared
   values for ALTO metric "RFcost" in order to appropriately schedule
   its unattended data transmission.  The ALTO information resource
   'ALTO Calendar' provides an array of time-dependent cost values and
   is being specified in [draft-ietf-alto-cost-calendar].  In addition,
   the ALTO Client wants these values for both the "uda" and "udna"
   context.  Last, we assume that the UE needs the Cost values for both
   the uplink (UE to Cell-k) and downlink (Cell-k to UE) directions.  We
   assume that the UE is located in the PID called "Cell1".

   In this scenario, C1 is limited by its uplink capacity, C2 is limited
   by its downlink capacity.  ALTO can be used to convey the following
   information:

   At time interval T1 of the next Calendar:

   - if C1 indicates "unattended data allowed" the downlink RF cost is
   20, and the uplink RF cost is 70

   - if C1 indicates "unattended data NOT allowed", the downlink RF cost
   is 20, and the uplink RF cost is 90

   - if C2 indicates "unattended data allowed" the downlink RF cost is
   70, and the uplink RF cost is 20

   - if C2 indicates "unattended data NOT allowed", the downlink RF cost
   is 90, in the uplink RF cost is 20.

   The ALTO Calendar provides values for the other 11 time intervals Ti.

4.4.  Design option: Network Map with cells as PIDs

   In this design, the cellular topology is represented with an ALTO
   Network Map comprising PIDs named "Cell1", "Cell2", ... "Celln".  The
   UE is located in one of these PIDs.  A Cost Map is associated to this
   Network Map and conveys metrics indicated in the IRD.  The Cost Map
   is requested to convey connection costs between firstly the UE to its
   serving cell (that is the PID to itself) and secondly the UE and
   neighboring cells (that is the PID to another one) and last, for both
   uplink and downlink directions.

   The ALTO Server can regularly update the Cost Map and send filtered
   information to the ALTO Client.  The proposed IRD design announces
   additional context attributes "uplink", "downlink".  In this case and
   other potential cases, the context parameters need to be arranged
   w.r.t. their possible combinations (to be further specified in the
   IRD).  For example, the IRD may announce that costs are provided for
   contexts "uda" and "udna" and this in both contexts "uplink" and
   "downlink".  Or that costs are provided for contexts "uplink" and
   "downlink" and this in both contexts "udna" and "uda".  In such a
   case, the IRD capability member may list the possible combinations in
   the capabilities as follows:


   "cost-context" : [ // ++NEW

   This arrangement indicates that for the metric named "num-RFcost",
   the ALTO Server can provide 4 different values: v1 for ["uda" AND
   "uplink"], ... v4 for ["udna" AND "downlink"].

   Further versions may specify more elaborated logical combinations of
   context parameters.

4.4.1.  Network Map: FCM Request for contextual 'RFcost'

   The ALTO Client can specify the desired cost value context parameters
   in the request input.  In particular, it can select one or more
   combinations indicated in the IRD.  Its input parameter "cost-
   context-params" is an array of all the desired combinations.  In this

   indicated combinations.

4.5.  Use case 2: example ALTO transactions for the ECS

   In this use case, the UE requests the ECS to a local ALTO server for
   the routingcost to the PGW and wants the metric values varying w.r.t.
   the "access-type" and "SLA-id".  Note that the "context" related
   design feature can be easily transposed for the Cost Map Service.

4.5.1.  Use case 2: example with logical context parameter combinations

   This section proposes a design, allowing a Client to arrange input
   context parameters in logical combinations.  The purpose is to show
   how such combinations of context parameters avoids specifying as many
   metrics and moderates the amount of exchanged data.

   In this example the ALTO Server indicates in its IRD that it can
   provide endpoint cost maps for metrics "routingcost" and
   "bandwidthscore".  Values for metric "routingcost" are provided
   w.r.t. 2 types of context parameters.  The ALTO Client may query
   values for metric "routingcost" for either of these types of
   parameters or both or none.

Internet-Draft              Abbreviated-Title                 March 2017


   For each type, the parameters are listed in an array.  We have 2
   arrays:

   - ["cell", "wifi", "lan"]

   - ["SLA-1", "SLA-2", "SLA-3"]

   This indicates that in each array, the client can pick one or more
   parameters and combine them with one or more parameters in the second
   array.  The ALTO Server will provide costs w.r.t. the AND combination
   accross and within arrays.

   In the present example, if the Client requests cost values for the
   combination:

   [["cell", "wifi"], ["SLA-3"]]

   The server will provide 2 values: one for ("cell" AND "SLA-3")and the
   second one for ("wifi" and "SLA"-3").

   The IRD below specifies the possibility to combine parameters from
   the two arrays of the example above.

4.5.1.2.  Use case 2: example ECS request with logical context parameter
          combinations

   The ALTO Client queries the ECS between 2 endpoints for the following
   combinations: ("cell" AND "SLA-3")and ("wifi" and "SLA"-3") and thus
   arranges its input context parameters as follows:

5.  Deployment case: local ALTO Server cascaded with global ALTO Server

   To maintain scalability, the ALTO coverage network zone can be
   decomposed in one "local"ALTO Server part covering a restricted local
   network zone, for instance within the first IP hop range and another
   "global" part covering the rest of the ISP network, similarly to what
   is proposed in [draft-ietf-alto-deployments].  The local ALTO server
   may include the guidance given by the ISP ALTO server and compose it
   with the "global" guidance in its replies to its ALTO clients.
   Recent ALTO WG discussions open the possibility for one IRD to
   indicate multiple network maps having different levels of detail.

5.1.  Cascaded ALTO Servers with one network map each

   In the "cascaded" use case, the ALTO Service is preferably
   distributed among two ALTO Servers as follows:

   The ALTO Client serving the UE is referred to as the LAOC and can be
   located either in the UE or in the network.

   1.  A Local ALTO Server (LAOS)

       *  Hosts the information on the local EPS network, covering the
          paths between e.g. the UEs and the cells or the PGWs,

       *  Hosts an ALTO Client that sends an ALTO request to a "global"
          ALTO Server, covering the zone beyond the PGW.  It can
          possibly get the global Server updates using the extensions
          specified in [draft-ietf-alto-incr-update-sse].

       *  receives the ALTO request issued by the ALTO Client associated
          to the UE.

   2.  a "core" ALTO Server covers the whole ISP network view, as it
       would if the "local ALTO Service" is not available or
       deactivated.
