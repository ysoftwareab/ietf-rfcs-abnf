Internet-Draft          New NAS-Port-Type Values              March 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a set of new values for the NAS-Port-Type
   Attribute [RFC2865].


2.  NAS-Port-Type Values

   This document defines new values for the NAS-Port-Type Attribute.
   This specification concerns the following values:

      30	PPPoA (PPP over ATM [RFC3336])

      31	PPPoEoA (PPP over Ethernet [RFC2516] over ATM)

      32	PPPoEoE (PPP over Ethernet [RFC2516] over Ethernet

      33	PPPoEoVLAN (PPP over Ethernet [RFC2516] over VLAN)

      34	PPPoEoQinQ (PPP over Ethernet [RFC2516] over IEEE 802.1QinQ)


3.  IANA Considerations

3.1  Attribute Values

   This document is intended to act as a request for allocation of the
   numbers listed  by IANA in the appropriate registry [RADTYP],
   according to the allocation policy given in [RFC3575].

   The values given have already been implemented by at least one vendor
   without assignment by IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification neither adds to nor detracts from the security of
   the RADIUS protocol.
