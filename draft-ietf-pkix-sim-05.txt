   parties to determine whether the subject of a particular certificate
   is also the person corresponding to a particular sensitive
   identifier.

1. Introduction

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document (in uppercase,
   as shown) are to be interpreted as described in [2119].

   A Certification Authority (CA) issues X.509 public key certificates
   to bind a public key to a subject. The subject is specified through
   one or more subject names in the "subject" and/or "subjectAltName"
   fields of a certificate. The "subject" field contains a
   hierarchically structured distinguished name. The "subjectAltName
   field" may contain an electronic mail address, IP address, or other
   name forms that correspond to the subject.

   For each particular CA, a subject name corresponds to a unique
   person, device, group, or role. The CA will not knowingly issue
   certificates to multiple entities under the same name. That is, for a
   particular certificate issuer, all currently valid certificates
   asserting the same subject name(s) are bound to the same entity.

   Where the subject is a person, the name that is specified in the
   subject field of the certificate typically reflects the legal name of
   the individual and affiliated entities (e.g., their corporate
   affiliation). In reality, however, there are individuals or
   corporations that have the same or similar names. It may be difficult
   for a relying party (e.g., a person or application) to associate the
   certificate with a specific person. This ambiguity presents a problem
   for many applications.

   In some cases, applications need to ensure that the subject of
   certificates issued by different CAs are in fact the same entity.
   This requirement may be met by including a "permanent identifier" in
   all certificates issued to the same subject, which is unique across
   multiple CAs. By comparing the "permanent identifier", the relying
   party may identify certificates from different CAs that are bound to
   the same subject. This solution is defined in [RFC4043].

   In many cases, such as a Social Security Number, a person or
   corporation's identifier is regarded as a sensitive, private or
   personal data. Such an identifier cannot simply be included as part
   of the subject field, since its disclosure lead to misuse.
   Therefore, privacy sensitive identifiers cannot be included in
   certificates as plaintext.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Subject Identification Method             May 2005


   On the other hand, such an identifier is not actually a secret.
   People choose to disclose these identifiers for certain classes of
   transactions. For example, people may disclose their Social Security
   Number to open a bank account or obtain a loan. This is typically
   corroborated by presenting physical credentials (e.g., a driver
   license) which confirms the person's name or address.

   To support such applications in an online environment, relying
   parties need to determine whether the subject of a particular
   certificate is also the person corresponding to a particular
   sensitive identifier. Ideally, applications would leverage the
   applicants's electronic credential (e.g., the X.509 public key
   certificate) to corroborate this identifier, but the subject field of
   a certificate does not provide sufficient information.

   To fulfill these demands, this document defines the Privacy-Enhanced
   Protected Subject Identifier (PEPSI) format for including a privacy
   sensitive identifier in a certificate. When the subject of the
   certificate chooses to disclose the identifier and the relying party
   may verify the identifier.  A party that obtains the certificate
   containing a PEPSI can not determine the privacy sensitive identifier
   without performing a brute force attack, and each certificate must be
   attacked separately. Furthermore, the subject can prove to the
   relying party that they are associated with a valid identification
   without disclosing the identifier. For example, a person could prove
   they possessed a valid social security number without disclosing the
   identifier itself.

   In addition, this document defines an Encrypted PEPSI(EPEPSI) so that
   sensitive identifier information can be exchanged without disclosing
   the identifier.

   This document is organized as follows:

   - Section 2 establishes security and usability requirements;
   - Section 3 provides an overview of the mechanism;
   - Section 4 defines syntax and generation rules.


2. Requirements

2.1 Security Requirements

   Given

     - Alice, a certificate holder, with an a sensitive identifier SIIa
       (such as her Social Security Number, SSN)
     - Bob, a relying party who will rely on knowing Alice's true SIIa



Park, et. al.            Expires - November 2005        	[Page 3]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Subject Identification Method             May 2005


     - Eve an attacker who has Alice's certificate
     - An RA to whom Alice must divulge her SIIa; and
     - A CA who will issue Alice's certificate.

   We wish to design a PEPSI, using a password that Alice chooses, that
   has the following properties:

     - Alice can prove her true SII, SIIa to Bob;
     - Eve has a large work factor to determine the Alice's SIIa from
       her certificate, even if Alice chooses a weak password, and a
       very large work factor if  Alice chooses a good password;
     - Even if Eve can determine SIIa, she has an equally hard problem
       to find any other SII'a from any other PEPSI; that is, there is
       nothing she can pre-compute that helps every attack against a
       PEPSI, and nothing she learns from a successful attack
       that helps in any other attack;
     - The CA does not learn Alice's SIIa except the case where the CA
       needs to validate the SII passed by the RA.
     - The CA can treat the PEPSI as an additional name form in the
       "subjectAltName" extesnion with no special processing; and
     - Alice cannot find another SII'a, password combination that will
       allow her to use the certificate to prove a false SII to Bob.

2.2 Usability Requirements

   In addition to the security properties stated above, we have the
   following usability requirements:

     - When the PEPSI is used, any custom processing occurs at the
       relying party. Alice can use commercial off the shelf software
       (e.g., a standard browser) without modifications.

2.3 Solution

   The solution:   Let SIM = R || PEPSI where
                   PEPSI = H(H( P || R || SIItype || SII))

   Then:

   1.      Alice picks a password P, and gives P, SIItype, and SII
           to the RA.
   2.      The RA validates SIItype and SII.
   3.      The RA generates a random value R.
   4.      The RA generates the SIM = R, PEPSI where PEPSI =
           H(H(P || R || SIItype || SII)).
   5.      The RA sends the PEPSI to Alice by out-of-band and passes
           the SIM to the CA.
   6.      Alice sends a certRequest form to CA which generates

INTERNET-DRAFT        Subject Identification Method             May 2005


           Alice's certificate including the SIM as a form of
           otherName from the GeneralName structure in SubjectAltName
           extension.

   7.      Alice sends Bob her Cert, as well as P, SIItype, and SII.
   8.      Bob can compute PEPSI' = H(H(P || R || SIItype || SII)) and
           compare SIM' = R || PEPSI' to the value in the SIM, thereby
           verifying SII.

   If Alice wishes to prove she has a valid identifier, without
   disclosing it, then steps 7 and 8 are as follows:

   7.      Alice sends intermediate value H(P || R || SIItype ||
           SII)) and her certificate to Bob.
   8.      Bob can get R form the SIM in the certificate, then
           compute H(intermediate value) and compare it to the
           value in SIM, thereby verifying Alice's knowledge of
           P and SII.

   Eve has to exhaustively search the H(P || R || SIItype || SII) space
   to find Alice's SII. This is a fairly hard problem even if Alice uses
   a poor password, and a really hard problem if Alice uses a fairly
   good password.

   Even if Eve finds Alice's P, SIItype, SII pairs or constructs a
   massive dictionary of P, SIItype, SII pairs, it doesn't help find any
   other SII, because a new R is used for each PEPSI.


3. Procedures

3.1 Symbols

   The following cryptography symbols are defined in this document.

       H()        Cryptographically secure hash algorithm.
                  SHA-1[FIPS 180-1] or more secure hash function is
                  specification required.

       SII        Sensitive Identification Information.
                  (e.g, Social Security Number or Maryland Driver
                  License)

       SIItype    Object Identifier that identifies the type of SII.

       P          A user chosen password.

       PEPSI      Privacy-Enhnaced Protected Subject Information.
                  Calculated from the input value P, R, SIItype, SII
                  using two iteration of H().

       E()        The public key encryption algorithm used by RA.
                  Used for encrypting the PEPSI.

       EPEPSI     Encrypted PEPSI.

       D()        The public key decryption algorithm used by CA.
                  Used for decrypting the EPEPSI.

3.2 SII and SIItype

   The user presents evidence that a particular SII has been assigned to
   them. The SII is composed of an alphanumeric string. The SIItype is
   an OID which defines the format and scope of the SII value.  For
   example, in Korea, SIItype is as blow.

   KISA specific OIDs id-KISA OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
     {iso(1) member-body(2) korea(410) kisa(200004)}

   KISA arcs
   id-npki OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-KISA 10}
   id-attribute OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-npki 1}
   id-kisa-identifyData OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-attribute 1}
   id-VID OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-kisa-identifyData 10}
   id-SII OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-VID 1}

   For closed communities, the SIItype value may be assigned by the CA
   itself.

3.3 User Chosen Password

   The user selects a password as one of the input values for the SIM.
   The strength of the password is critical to protection of the user's
   SII. User should be encouraged to select passwords that will be
   difficult to guess and long enough to protect against bute force
   attacks.

   Implementations of this specification MUST permit a user to select
   passwords of up to 28 characters. RAs SHOULD implement password
   selection rules to prevent user selection of trivial passwords.  See
   [FIPS 112] and [FIPS 180-1] for selecting security criteria for
   password and an automated password generator algorithm that randomly
   creates simple pronounceable syllables as passwords.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Subject Identification Method             May 2005


3.4 Random Number Generation

   A The RA generates a random number, R. A new R MUST be generated for
   each SIM in a certificate.  The length of R MUST be the same as the
   length of the output of the hash algorithm H.  For example, where H
   is SHA-1 the random number MUST be 160 bits.

   Whenever a certificate or key needs to be updated, a new R SHOULD be
   generated and the SIM SHOULD be recomputed. Replicating the value of
   the previous SIM from a previous certificate permits an attacker to
   identify certificates associated with the same physical person, which
   may be undesirable.

   A Random Number Generator(RNG) meets the requirements defined in
   [FIPS 140-2] is strongly recommended.

3.5 Generation of PEPSI

   The SIM in the subjectAltName extension within the certificate
   identifies an entity even if it has multiple names in its
   certificates.  RAs MUST calculate the unique value of the SIM with
   the designated inputs according to the following algorithm:

   SIM = R || PEPSI
      PEPSI = H(H(P || R || SIItype || SII))

   The SII is known to a RA at user enrollment. One of SHA-1 or SHA-256
   MUST be used for ensuring the integrity of PEPSI.

   Note that the P, SIItype, and SII passing from the end entity to the
   RA MUST be protected.

   The syntax and the associated OID for SIM are also provided in the
   ASN.1 modules in Section 4.1. Also, Section 4.2 describes the syntax
   for PEPSI in the ASN.1 modules.

3.6 Encryption of PEPSI

   This section describes procedures for encrypting the SIItype, SII and
   PEPSI.

   It may be required where the CA itself verifies SII before issuing
   the certificate. To meet this requirement, RAs SHOULD encrypt the
   SIItype, SII, and PEPSI with the CA's public key and send it to CA in
   addition to SIM. Therefore, RA MUST acquire the CA's public
   encryption certificate although the way of obtaining it is not
   covered in this document.

INTERNET-DRAFT        Subject Identification Method             May 2005


      EPEPSI = E(SIItype || SII || PEPSI)

   The syntax and the associated OID for EPEPSI is provided in the ASN.1
   modules in Section 4.3.

3.7 Certification Request

   As described above, the certificate request message MAY contain the
   PEPSI. [RFC2314] and [RFC2511] are widely used message syntaxes for
   certification requests.

   Basically, PKCS#10 is consists of a distinguished name, a public key
   and a optionally a set of attributes, collectively signed by the end
   entity.  The PEPSI SHOULD be included in the attribute field of

   In case of using the RFC2511(CRMF) for certificate request message,
   an PEPSI SHOULD be included in the 'regInfo' field defined in Section
   3 of [RFC2511].

   In case that CA itself verifies SII before issuing the certificate,
   the value of PEPSI in certification request form SHOULD be changed to
   EPEPSI which the requestor has made by himself or herself.  The
   requestor MUST acquire the CA's public encryption certificate
   although the way of obtaining it is not covered in this document.

3.8 Certification

   A CA issue certificate containing the SIM as a form of otherName from
   the GeneralName structure in "SubjectAltName" extension.

   In an environment in which a CA verifies SII before issuing the
   certificate, a CA decrypts the EPEPSI with its own private key
   according to the following algorithm. It then validates that the SII
   value is correct.

      SIItype, SII, PEPSI = D(EPEPSI)


4. Definition

4.1 SIM Naming Syntax

   This section specifies the syntax for SIM name form included in
   subjectAltName extension. The SIM is composed of the three fields,
   the hash algorithm identifier, the authority chosen random value, and
   the value of the PEPSI itself.

   Suggest an OID in the id-on arc as follows:

            { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
              security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) }

      id-on-SIM OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-on 6 }

        SIM ::= SEQUENCE {
            hashAlg          AlgorithmIdentifier,
            authorityRandom  OCTET STRING,   -- RA chosen random number

                                             -- pEPSI

                                             -- with algorithm hashAlg
        }

4.2 PEPSI

   This section specifies the syntax for PEPSI. The PEPSI is generated
   by performing the same hash function twice. The PEPSI is generated
   over the ASN.1 structure HashContent. HashContent has four values:
   the user selected password, the authority chosen random number, the
   identifer type, and the identifier itself.

        HashContent ::= SEQUENCE {
           userPassword     UTF8String,
                            -- user supplied password
           authorityRandom  OCTET STRING,
                            -- RA chosen random number
           identifierType   OBJECT IDENTIFIER,  -- SIItype
           identifier       UTF8String          -- SII
        }

   Before calculating a PEPSI, conforming implementations MUST process
   the userPassword with the six step [LDAPBIS STRPREP] string
   preparation algorithm as follows:

      * In step 2, Map, the mapping shall include procedssing of
        characters commonly mapped to nothing, as specified in Appendix
        B.1 of [RFC 3454].
      * Omit step 6, Insignificant Character Removal.

4.3 Encrypted PEPSI

   This section describes the syntax for Encrypted PEPSI. The Encrypted
   PEPSI has three fields: identifierType, identifier, and PEPSI.

        EncryptedPEPSI ::= SEQUENCE {
           identifierType  OBJECT IDENTIFIER, -- SIItype



Park, et. al.            Expires - November 2005        	[Page 9]

           identifier      UTF8String,        -- SII
           pEPSI           OCTET STRING       -- PEPSI
        }

   When it is used for certificate request, the OID in 'regInfo' of
   RFC2511 and PKCS#10 is as follows:

   id-regEPEPSI OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkip 3 }


5. Example Usage of SIM

   Depending on a different security environments, there are three
   possible use cases with SIM.

        1.     When a relying party doesn't have any information about
               the certificate user.
        2.     When a relying party already have the SII of certificate
               user.
        3.     When a certificate user want to disclose his SII.

   For the use case 1, SII and a user chosen password P which only a
   user know must be sent to a relying party via secure commnuication.
   Together with the password, the certificate including the SIM must be
   transmitted. Then the relying party can get R from the certificate.
   The relying party can verify that the subject of certificate issued
   by a CA is in fact the same entity who sends the password and the
   certificate.

   If comparing first two use cases, their overall procedure is almost
   same except that the SII isn't required by the relying party.
   Threfore, a certificate user transmit simply the password, P, and the
   certificate. The rest of detailed procedure is the same as that of
   the use case 1.

   For the last speical use case that a certificate user want to
   disclose his SII, the only information sent by a ceritificate user is
   the intermediate value of the PEPSI, H(R || P || SIItype || SII).
   Upon receiving of it, the relying party can verify the user by
   rehashing the value and comparing it with SIM in the certificate.


6. Security Considerations

   A cryptographically secure hash function such as SHA-1 and SHA-256
   must be used for maintaining the integrity of the PEPSI since the
   security of the PEPSI by composing hash value of R, SIItype, and SII
   is totally depending on hash function.  Specifically, it is



Park, et. al.            Expires - November 2005       	[Page 10]





INTERNET-DRAFT        Subject Identification Method             May 2005


   impossible for an attacker to find user P, authority random number,
   and SII which generate the same value of the SIM since SHA-1 requires
   2^80 work factor where 160 is the bit-length of the hash value of
   SHA-1.

   In addition, a fairly good password is needed to protect against the
   brute force attacks on H(P || R || SIItype || SII) space.  Due to the
   short length of the SII, it is likely that an attacker can reasonably
   guess it with partial information about gender, age, and date of
   birth. Therefore it is important for users to select a fairly good
   password in order that an attacker is unable to verify whether the
   guessed SII is accurate or not unless he collects all input values
   for SIM.


7. IANA Considerations

   In the future, IANA may be asked to establish a registry of object
   identifiers to promote interoperability in the specification of SII
   types.
