                      Source Network PIM Snooping
            draft-zhou-pim-source-network-pim-snooping-00

Abstract

   This document proposes a multicast stream prohibition method based on
   the switch between source and FHR (First Hop Router) snooping unicast
   PIM messages towards source which enables switch to prohibit
   unnecessary multicast stream towards FHR.

1.  Introduction

   In many typical deployment scenarios, link layer switches running
   IGMP-Snooping which exist between multicast sources and PIM FHR have
   to forward all multicast streams to PIM FHR.  This will lead to waste
   of switches' cache and link bandwidth.  The problem has been
   discribed in detail in the draft of
   draft-dizhou-pim-umf-problem-statement.

   This document proposes a method for switch between source and FHR to
   snoop unicast PIM messages towards source which enables switch to
   prohibit unnecessary multicast stream towards FHR.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]

   With respect to PIM, this document follows the terminology that has
   been defined in RFC 4601 [RFC4601].

2.1.  Definitions

   Pruned port: A port of PIM-Snooping entry which stops forwarding
   multicast stream.

   Downstream port: A port of PIM-Snooping entry which forwards
   multicast stream.

   Upstream port: A port of PIM-Snooping entry which receives multicast
   source.

   Membership port: A port of IGMP-Snooping entry at which the switch
   receives IGMP Membership Report.

   Router port: A port of IGMP-Snooping entry at which the swtich
   receives IGMP Query or PIM massages.

   If a port has characters of Downstream port, Pruned port, Membership
   port simultaneously, the priority sequence is Membership port, Pruned
   port, Downstream port.

3.  Protocol Description

   The PIM snooping functionality is separated into two control sections
   (PIM forwarding and IGMP forwarding) and a data section (Data
   forwarding).

3.1.  PIM Forwarding Rules

   When switch receives a PIM Hello, it will create pim neighbor list.

   When switch receives a Unicast PIM Prune, it will judge whether the
   PIM Prune is from the port at which there is a corresponding pim
   neighbor and whether the upstream neighbor address of the PIM Prune
   is in its pim neighbor list.  If the former is yes and the latter is
   no, it will create a pruned port, at which the switch received the
   PIM Prune, for the PIM-Snooping (S,G) entry, as well as a upstream
   port which could be found by mac table.  If the entry of (S,G) is
   created at first time, other ports where there are pim neighbors
   SHALL be added as downstream ports into the out-interface list of
   (S,G) entry.  If the former is no, the PIM Prune shall be discarded.
   If the former is yes and the latter is yes, it shall be processed as
   traditional pim-snooping.

   If the PIM-Snooping (S,G) entry has no downstream port and other
   pruned ports and IGMP-Snooping entry has no membership port, switch
   shall forward the PIM Prune towards source.  Otherwise the PIM Prune
   SHALL be discarded.

   Lifetime of Pruned port is 1/3 of that of (S,G) entry.  After time
   out, the port would be changed to be a downstream port.

   This (S,G) entry SHALL be punched with a specific sign.

   When switch receives a Unicast PIM Join, it will judge whether the
   PIM Join is from the port at which there is a corresponding pim
   neighbor and whether the upstream neighbor address of the PIM Prune
   is in its pim neighbor list.  If the former is yes and the latter is
   no, it will change the pruned port to be a downstream port, at which
   the switch received the PIM Join, for the (S,G) entry.  If the former
   is no, the PIM Prune shall be discarded.  If the former is yes and
   the latter is yes, it shall be processed as traditional pim-snooping.

   If the PIM-Snooping entry has no other downstream ports and IGMP-
   Snooping entry has no other membership ports, switch shall forward
   the PIM Join towards source.  Otherwise the PIM Join SHALL be
   discarded.

   If (S,G) entry with the specific sign has no pruned ports, it SHALL

   be deleted.

3.2.  IGMP Forwarding Rules

   For the IGMP Membership Report, switch SHALL forward it towards
   Upstream port and Downstream ports.

3.3.  Data Forwarding Rules

   When there is no PIM-Snooping (S,G) entry, multicast stream of (S,G)
   SHALL be forwarded by swtich towards router ports and membership
   ports of IGMP-Snooping entry.

   If there is an PIM-Snooping entry of (S,G), switch SHALL forward
   multicast stream towards downstream ports and membership ports, but
   stop forwarding towards pruned ports.  If a port has characters of
   Downstream port, Pruned port, Membership port simultaneously, the
   priority sequence is Membership port, Pruned port, Downstream port.
   The swtich SHALL treat the port as the most prior character.

4.  Other solutions

   If the UNICAST PIM Join message is replaced with IGMP Graft like
   message, and the UNICAST PIM Prune message is replaced with IGMP
   Prune like message, the mechanism above is also suitable.
