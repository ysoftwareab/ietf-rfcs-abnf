                 Multicast Network Address Translation
                     draft-jholland-mboned-mnat-00

Abstract

   This document defines a method for a network to maintain Network
   Address Translation address mappings for the transport of globally
   addressed multicast traffic within a network that can't otherwise
   forward the globally addressed traffic.  A new Multicast Network
   Address Translation (MNAT) service is defined to communicate the
   address mappings to ingress and egress points within the network, and
   considerations for operation of the MNAT service are described.

1.  Introduction

   Network Address Translation is very widely used for unicast traffic
   in a variety of networks and according to a variety of mechanisms.
   [RFC2663] is recommended reading for background on the ways unicast
   NAT is used.

   The handling of multicast traffic can pose a variety of additional
   problems for a network, some of which can be mitigated or avoided if

   traffic can be mapped to a different address space than its original
   addressing.  This document defines a new service, Multicast Network
   Address Translation (MNAT), as a mechanism to administer network
   address mappings for multicast traffic within a network, for the
   purpose of working around various addressing-related issues.  An
   overview of some of the motivating use cases that require network
   address remapping for multicast traffic is given in Section 1.3.  An
   explanation of the protocol operation is given in Section 2.

   Messaging to and from the MNAT service is defined with RESTCONF
   [RFC8040] using the YANG [RFC7950] model in Section 3.

   Unlike traditional unicast NAT, MNAT performs address translation at
   both an ingress point to the network where the traffic is transformed
   to use an address scheme local to the network, and also at an egress
   point from the network where the traffic is transformed back to the
   original address scheme for further forwarding, or for further
   processing by a receiving application.

1.1.  Background

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the concepts and
   terminology regarding source-specific multicast as described in
   [RFC4607] and the use of IGMPv3 [RFC3376] and MLDv2 [RFC3810] for
   group management of source-specific multicast channels, as described
   in [RFC4604].

   The reader is also assumed to be familiar with the concepts and
   terminology for RESTCONF [RFC8040] and YANG [RFC7950].

   The reader is also assumed to be familiar with the use of DNS-SD
   [RFC6763] for discovery of services provided by the network to end
   hosts.

   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Motivation

   This section lists use cases where a global (S,G) may not be possible
   to transport within a network, requiring the use of some kind of
   encapsulation or address translation in order to adequately
   communicate the group membership for packet replication within the
   network, or in order to perform the forwarding for the subscribed
   traffic within the network.

   o  Global IPv6 (S,G)s subscribed from within an IPv4-only network, or
      global IPv4 (S,G)s subscribed from within an IPv6-only network.

   o  Networks with legacy devices that support only IGMPv2 or MLDv1, or
      otherwise do not support SSM and cannot discover the external
      sources without the use of non-standard services since interdomain
      any-source multicast has been deprecated (see [RFC8815]).

   o  Networks that provision multicast transport and packet replication
      channels with static group addresses instead of dynamic tree-
      building protocols like PIM-SM [RFC7761].

   A note elaborating on the use of static provisioning of multicast
   groups:

   Some networks have found that there are good use cases to deliver a
   limited set of packet-replicating flows, including sometimes the use
   of externally sourced multicast traffic, but have struggled with the
   operational complexity of operating a dynamic tree-building system
   based on PIM-SM [RFC7761].  Operating an MNAT service can allow these
   networks to provide for the limited use of packet-replicating data
   channels while keeping the operational complexity of handling a
   dynamically changing set of channels confined to a single service
   that implements their business logic for admission control, rather
   than trying to apply access control lists for group membership
   propagation spread across the network.

2.  Protocol Operation

2.1.  Overview

   The use of MNAT within a network is defined in terms the folowing
   entities:

   o  MNAT service

   o  ingress nodes

   o  egress nodes

   Address translation is performed at the ingress and egress nodes.
   Ingress is where an external (S,G) is mapped to locally assigned
   address mapping before being forwarded for transport within the
   network.  Egress is where the traffic received on locally assigned
   addresses is translated back to the corresponding external (S,G)
   address before being forwarded for further transmission or processed
   by a receiving application.

   The MNAT service maintains the mapping between external (S,G)s and
   the local network addresses used to transport traffic of those (S,G)s
   within the network.  The address mapping is performed according to
   the needs of the network operating the MNAT service, to satisfy
   whatever constraints and restrictions may be necessary or desirable
   according to the operational considerations within that network.
   Some example considerations that have motivated the design of MNAT
   are described in Section 1.3.

   Ingress and egress nodes communicate with the MNAT service according
   to the schema defined by the YANG model in Section 3.  In particular,
   they maintain an up-to-date table of the mappings between the
   external (S,G)s and the locally assigned addresses for transport
   within the network in order to perform the corresponding network
   address translations.

   TBD: probably add a diagram here.  Probably something roughly similar
   to page 7 of the IETF 108 mboned presentation touching on this:
   https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/108/slides/slides-108-mboned-status-
   update-on-multicast-to-the-browser-00.pdf#page=7

2.1.1.  Egress Node Operational Modes

   Egress nodes can run in at least two separate modes of operation.

   One of the modes is "bump in the wire", which refers to a node that
   receives traffic using the network-assigned locally chosen addresses,



Holland                    Expires May 4, 2021                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    MNAT                      October 2020


   and translates the traffic back to the associated externally
   addressed (S,G) before forwarding the traffic along the rest of the
   network paths to the receiving applications that tried to join the
   external (S,G).

   The second mode is "bump in the host", which refers to a virtual node
   operating inside a client application.

   As a "bump in the host" egress node, the virtual egress node can
   discover and connect to the MNAT service from a receiving
   application.  The receiving application would then use the knowledge
   about the address mapping within the network to perform a join for
   the mapped addresses in the local network, rather than for the
   external (S,G), treating the payloads of the packets received as
   though they arrived with the external (S,G) addressing.

   A common scenario for a bump in the wire egress node deployment might
   be to have egress nodes operating in Customer Premesis Equipment
   (CPE), such as a Cable Modem or Wi-Fi router inside the home of a
   customer to a multicast-capable Internet Service Provider (ISP).  In
   this scenario, the egress node discovery mechanism for the MNAT
   service might be a static configuration for the MNAT service's
   hostname, pushed by the ISP to the CPE devices.

   For a bump in the host egress node, the discovery of the MNAT service
   might either operate via DNS-SD [RFC6763] using a search domain for
   the ISP distributed to hosts via a DHCP Domain Search option
   [RFC3397], or via configuration instructions the ISP gives to their
   customers to configure a search domain for their devices, or to
   configure the MNAT service's hostname for that ISP in their
   applications.

2.2.  Service Discovery

   It is RECOMMENDED that a network operating an MNAT service provide
   service discovery with the use of DNS-SD [RFC6763].  However, a
   network MAY use other mechanisms, including options such as manual
   configuration.  As long as an MNAT client can find a valid hostname
   to use, it can connect to the given MNAT service and monitor changes
   to the address assignments within the network.

2.2.1.  Detecting Invalid Services

   TBD: recommendations for noticing and discontinuing use of MNAT
   services that report mappings that don't correspond to the mappings
   apparently in use in the client's local network (particularly from
   egress nodes).

2.3.  RESTCONF Bootstrap

   TBD: describe the RESTCONF validation and bootstrapping steps.  Use
   the same section name from I-D.draft-ietf-mboned-dorms as a template,
   assuming it passes a wider review.

2.4.  Message Handling

2.4.1.  Notification Subscription

   When possible, changes to the group assignments should be
   communicated with subscriptions to data model updates using a server
   push mechanism, for example as described in [RFC8641].

   Where clients or servers do not support server push updates, long
   polling can be used instead to provide timely updates.  See [RFC6202]
   for an explanation of the approach and a discussion of its pros and
   cons.

   If long polling and server push are both unavailable, MNAT clients
   may need to poll the server to monitor updates instead.  This
   approach is likely to encounter delays in the detection of changes to
   mapping decisions within the MNAT service, but can be used as a last
   resort for providing multicast connectivity.

2.4.2.  Egress Keys

   Egress nodes open a persistent connection to the MNAT service and
   request allocation of an egress key with the get-new-egress-key rpc.
   Egress keys are identifiers chosen by the MNAT service and
   communicated to egress nodes in the response to a successful get-new-
   egress-key rpc.  Egress keys SHOULD be based on a random value and
   unique per new key requested.

   Egress nodes provide their egress key when performing group
   management functions (join and leave operations).

   TBD: better explanation about how the service times out egress nodes
   that don't refresh their egress key on schedule, and how egress nodes
   that reconnect can attempt to refresh the prior key they were using,
   but must request a new one on error.  Probably define a state per
   egress key (e.g. active vs. recently expired vs. non-existant) for
   the MNAT service to maintain.  Explain how the MNAT service should
   use population count from the egress joins to make prioritization
   decisions for the assignment of flows when there is limited flow
   space.  Probably reference CBACC in that explanation (I-D.draft-ietf-
   mboned-cbacc).

2.4.3.  Egress Group Management

   The join-global and leave-global RPCs in the YANG model provide a
   mechanism for egress nodes to directly advertise their group
   membership to the MNAT service for externally addressed (S,G)s.

   Egress nodes advertise their group membership to external (S,G)s to
   the MNAT service and also advertise group membership to their next-
   hop router using IGMP or MLD for the locally mapped addressing
   withing the network.  Joins and leaves for the locally mapped network
   addresses occur in response to downstream joins for an external (S,G)
   that has or gains a mapping according to the MNAT service, when the
   join or leave propagates to the egress node.

   Payloads of the locally mapped traffic should be treated as though
   they were carried in packets addressed as the external (S,G),
   including any authentication checks that should be performed for the
   traffic.  Egress nodes that forward traffic (non-virtual egress
   nodes) will perform an address translation from the locally mapped
   addreessing to the original (S,G) (according to the address mapping
   the MNAT service provides) before forwarding packets matching a
   locally mapped address.  It is the responsibility of the MNAT service
   and the network that operates it to ensure that multiple different
   traffic streams are not merged to the same locally mapped addresses
   in a way that collides.

2.4.4.  Ingress Considerations

   Like egress nodes, ingress nodes monitor the assignments provided by
   the MNAT service and perform network address translation and group
   membership propagation.  Ingress nodes perform the translation from
   an external (S,G) to the internally mapped addressing for the local
   network transport.

   In general, ingress nodes are translating traffic before the in-
   network multicast fanout to multiple egress nodes.  So an ingress
   node is generally assumed to be feeding one or more egress nodes.
   Because one ingress node can feed many egress nodes, ingress nodes
   should be given priority ahead of egress nodes for notifications
   about changes to the address mapping from the MNAT service.

2.4.5.  MNAT Service Considerations

   The details of the address assignment strategies used by the internal
   logic of the MNAT service are out of scope for this document.
   Different instances of MNAT services are expected to use a wide range
   of considerations specific to the networks in which the instances
   operate.

Internet-Draft                    MNAT                      October 2020


   However, outside of address assignment there are some operational
   points an MNAT service instance should take into consideration:

   1.  Assignment Transition Grace Period

       It's recommended to provide a grace period between reassigning a
       local address mapping to a new external (S,G) after unassigning
       its mapping to an old (S,G).  The grace period should account for
       the expected time for the connected ingress and egress nodes to
       process the unassigning of the external (S,G) and for egress
       nodes to perform leave operations for the old locally mapped
       address, and for the leave operations to propagate through the
       network.

   2.  Scaling

       The MNAT service should be appropriately provisioned to support
       the expected number of ingress and egress nodes within the
       network.  In an eyeball network, restrictions on the number of
       egress nodes per shared receiver IP address may be appropriate,
       to avoid a rogue client application from forming an excessive
       number of egress connections.  Alternately, for bump-in-the-wire
       deployments of egress nodes in CPE devices it may be appropriate
       to authenticate the egress connections with a client certificate
       for each home to avoid denial of service attacks based on
       overloading the MNAT service with egress connections.

       Additionally, it's RECOMMENDED to provide per-egress limits on
       the number of external simultaneous (S,G)s permitted per egress
       at a level appropriate to the scaling limitations for the

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  The YANG Module Names Registry

   This document adds one YANG module to the "YANG Module Names"
   registry maintained at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/yang-
   parameters>.  The following registrations are made, per the format in
   Section 14 of [RFC6020]:

         name:      ietf-mnat
         namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-mnat
         prefix:    mnat
         reference: I-D.draft-jholland-mboned-mnat

4.2.  The XML Registry

   This document adds the following registration to the "ns" subregistry
   of the "IETF XML Registry" defined in [RFC3688], referencing this
   document.

          URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-mnat
          Registrant Contact: The IESG.
          XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

4.3.  The Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry

   This document adds one service name to the "Service Name and
   Transport Protocol Port Number Registry" maintained at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers>.  The
   following registrations are made, per the format in Section 8.1.1 of
   [RFC6335]:

        Service Name:            mnat
        Transport Protocol(s):   TCP, UDP
        Assignee:                IESG <iesg@ietf.org>
        Contact:                 IETF Chair <chair@ietf.org>
        Description:             The MNAT service (RESTCONF that
                                 includes ietf-mnat YANG model)
        Reference:               I-D.draft-jholland-mboned-mnat
        Port Number:             N/A
        Service Code:            N/A
        Known Unauthorized Uses: N/A
        Assignment Notes:        N/A

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD.  (What, me worry?)

   Notable points to cover:

   o  communcation with the MNAT service should be secured.  RESTCONF
      does this, alternate methods should also do it.

   o  separate authentication of the contents of the multicast traffic
      is recommended.

   o  mistaken mappings can result in receipt of payloads for the wrong
      channel.  This can happen transiently even during normal
      operation.  Recommend some steps to mitigate and avoid.

   o  Clients can (deliberately or accidentally) overload the service.
      Limits should be set to avoid disrupting traffic to the rest of
      the network.
