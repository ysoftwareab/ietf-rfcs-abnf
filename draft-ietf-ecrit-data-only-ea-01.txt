                 the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
                  draft-ietf-ecrit-data-only-ea-01.txt

Abstract

   The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is a document format for
   exchanging emergency alerts and public warnings.  CAP is mainly used
   for conveying alerts and warnings between authorities and from
   authorities to citizen/individuals.  This document describes how
   data-only emergency alerts allow devices to issue alerts using the
   CAP document format.

1.  Introduction

   The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) [cap] is an XML document format
   for exchanging emergency alerts and public warnings.  CAP is mainly
   used for conveying alerts and warnings between authorities and from
   authorities to citizen/individuals.  This document describes how
   data-only emergency calls are able to utilize the same CAP document
   format.

   Data-only emergency alerts are similar to regular emergency calls in
   the sense that they require emergency call routing functionality and
   may even have the same location requirements.  On the other hand, the
   initial communication interaction will not lead to the establishment
   of a voice or video channel.

   Based on the deployment experience with non-IP based systems we
   distinguish between two types of environments, namely (1) data-only
   emergency alerts that are targeted directly to a recipient
   responsible for evaluating the alerts and for taking the necessary
   steps, including triggering an emergency call towards a Public Safety
   Answering Point (PSAP) and (2) alerts that are targeted to a Service
   URN as used for regular IP-based emergency calls where the recipient
   is not known to the originator.  We describe these two cases in more
   detail in Section 3.

3.  Architectural Overview

   This section illustrates two envisioned usage modes; targeted and
   location-based emergency alert routing.  Figure 1 shows a deployment
   variant where a sensor, as the author and originator of the alert, is
   pre-configured (using techniques outside the scope of this document)
   to issue an alert to a receiver or an aggregator, a special form of
   mediator, that processes these messages and performs whatever steps
   are necessary to appropriately react on the alert.  For example, a
   security firm may use different sensor inputs to dispatch their
   security staff to a building they protect.

    | Sensor     |              | Aggregator |

        |        MESSAGE with CAP      |
        |----------------------------->|
        |                              |
        |                           Aggregator
        |                           processes
        |                           emergency
        |                           alert
        |        200 (OK)              |
        |<-----------------------------|
        |                              |
        |                              |

                Figure 1: Targeted Emergency Alert Routing

   In Figure 2 a scenario is shown whereby the alert is routed using
   location information and the Service URN.  In case the LoST
   resolution is done at an emergency services routing proxy rather than
   at the entity issuing the alert since it may not know the address of
   the receiver.  A possible receiver is a PSAP and the recipient of the
   alert may be call taker.  In the generic case, there is very likely
   no prior relationship between the originator and the receiver, e.g.
   PSAP.  A PSAP, for example, is likely to receive and accept alerts
   from entities it cannot authorize.  This scenario corresponds more to
   the classical emergency services use case and the description in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-phonebcp] is applicable.

4.  Protocol Specification

4.1.  CAP Transport

   Since alerts structured via CAP require a "push" medium, they SHOULD
   be sent via the SIP MESSAGE.  The MIME type is set to 'application/
   common-alerting-protocol+xml'.

      Alternatively, the SIP PUBLISH mechanism or other SIP messages
      could be used.  However, the usage of SIP MESSAGE is a simple
      enough approach from an implementation point of view.

4.2.  Profiling of the CAP Document Content

   The usage of CAP MUST conform to the specification provided with
   [cap].  For the usage with SIP the following additional requirements
   are imposed:

   sender:  When the CAP was created by a SIP-based entity then the
      element MUST be populated with the SIP URI of that entity.


   incidents:  The <incidents> element MUST be present whenever there is
      a possibility that alert information needs to be updated.  The
      initial message will then contain an incident identifier carried
      in the <incidents> element.  This incident identifier MUST be
      chosen in such a way that it is unique for a given <sender,
      expires, incidents> combination.  Note that the <expires> element
      is optional and may not be present.


   scope:  The value of the <scope> element MUST be set to "private" as
      the alert is not meant for public consumption.  The <addresses>
      element is, however, not used by this specification since the
      message routing is performed by SIP and the respective address
      information is already available in the geolocation header.
      Populating location information twice into different parts of the
      message can quickly lead to inconsistency.


   parameter:  The <parameter> element MAY contain additional
      information specific to the sensor.


   area:  It is RECOMMENDED to omit this element when constructing a
      message.  In case that the CAP message already contained an <area>
      element then the specified location information MUST be copied
      into the PIDF-LO structure of the geolocation header element.

5.  Example

   Figure 3 shows a CAP document indicating a BURLARY alert issued by a
   sensor with the identity 'sensor1@domain.com'.  The location of the
   sensor can be obtained from the attached geolocation information
   provided via the geolocation header contained in the SIP MESSAGE
   structure.  Additionally, the sensor provided some data long with the
   alert message using proprietary information elements only to be
   processed by the receiver, a SIP entity acting as an aggregator.
   This example reflects the description in Figure 1.

6.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses security considerations when using SIP to make
   data-only emergency alerts utilizing CAP.  Location specific threats
   are not unique to this document and the discussion in
   [I-D.ietf-ecrit-trustworthy-location].

6.1.  Forgery

   Threat:

      An adversary could forge or alter a CAP document to report false
      emergency alarms.


   Countermeasures:

      To avoid this kind of attack, the entities must assure that proper
      mechanisms for protecting the CAP documents are employed, e.g.,
      signing the CAP document itself.  Section 3.3.2.1 of [cap]
      specifies the signing of CAP documents.  This does not protect
      against a legitimate sensor sending phrank alerts after being
      compromised.

6.2.  Replay Attack

   Threat:

      An adversary could eavesdrop alerts and reply them at a later
      time.


   Countermeasures:

      A CAP document contains the mandatory <identifier>, <sender>,
      <sent> elements and an optional <expire> element.  These
      attributes make the CAP document unique for a specific sender and
      provide time restrictions.  An entity that has received a CAP
      message already within the indicated timeframe is able to detect a
      replayed message and, if the content of that message is unchanged,
      then no additional security vulnerability is created.
      Additionally, it is RECOMMENDED to make use of SIP security
      mechanisms, such as SIP Identity [RFC4474], to tie the CAP message
      to the SIP message.

6.3.  Injecting False Alerts

   Threat:

      When an entity receives a CAP message it has to determine whether
      the entity distributing the CAP messages is genuine to avoid
      accepting messages that are injected by adversaries.  In scenario


   Countermeasures:

      For some types of data-only emergency calls author/originator and
      the receiver/recipient have a relationship with each other and
      hence it is possible (using cryptographic techniques) to verify
      whether a message was indeed issued by an authorized entity.
      Figure 1 is such an environment.  Standard SIP security mechanisms
      can be re-used for this purpose.  For example, identity based
      access control is a viable approach utilizing the asserted
      identity of the alert originator using P-Asserted-Identity
      [RFC3325] or SIP Identity [RFC4474].

      There are, however, other types of data-only emergency calls where
      there is no such relationship between the author/originator and
      the receiver/recipient.  Incoming alerts need to be treated more
      carefully than multi-media emergency calls that contain additional
      information, such as audio, to allow a call taker to sort out
      phrank calls.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Registration of the 'application/common-alerting-protocol+xml'
      MIME type

   To:  ietf-types@iana.org


   Subject:  Registration of MIME media type application/ common-
      alerting-protocol+xml


   MIME media type name:  application


   MIME subtype name:  common-alerting-protocol+xml


   Required parameters:  (none)


   Optional parameters:  charset; Indicates the character encoding of
      enclosed XML.  Default is UTF-8 [RFC3629].


   Encoding considerations:  Uses XML, which can employ 8-bit
      characters, depending on the character encoding used.  See RFC
      3023 [RFC3023], Section 3.2.


   Security considerations:  This content type is designed to carry
      payloads of the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).


   Interoperability considerations:  This content type provides a way to
      convey CAP payloads.


   Published specification:  RFC XXX [Replace by the RFC number of this
      specification].


   Applications which use this media type:  Applications that convey
      alerts and warnings according to the CAP standard.
