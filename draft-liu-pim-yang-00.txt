1.  Introduction

   YANG[RFC6020] is a data definition language that was introduced to
   define the contents of a conceptual data store that allows networked
   devices to be managed using NETCONF[RFC6241].  YANG is proving
   relevant beyond its initial confines, as bindings to other
   interfaces(e.g.  REST) and encoding other than XML (e.g.  JSON) are
   being defined.  Furthermore, YANG data models can be used as the
   basis of implementation for other interface, such as CLI and
   Programmatic APIs.

   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure
   and manage PIM.  It includes PIM SM[RFC4601], PIM
   SSM[RFC4607][RFC4608],PIM BSR[RFC5059].  In addition, It can extend
   PIM DM[RFC3973], BIDIR PIM[RFC5015] etc. features described in PIM
   standards other than mentioned above RFC in future version.

2.  Terminology

   o  PIM: Protocol Independent Multicast

   o  SM: Sparse Mode

   o  SSM: Source-specific Multicast

   o  DM: Dense Mode

   o  BSR: Bootstrap Router

   o  RP: Rendezvous Point

   o  SPT: shortest-path tree

   o  RPT: Rendezvous Point Tree

3.  Design of Data Model

3.1.  Overview

   Because PIM SSM is a subset of PIM SM, it is not necessary to assign
   a separate container for PIM SSM.  The PIM Yang module is divided
   into two main containers :

   o  PIM_BSR : that contains all pim bsr&rp writable configuration
      objects.

   o  PIM_SM : that contains all pim sm writable configuration objects.

   The figure below describes the overall structure of the PIM Yang
   module :

3.2.  PIM BSR Configuration

   PIM BSR configuration container has only one main container:

   o  PIM_BSR-instances : that contains all pim c-bsr and c-rp writable

   parameters of the public PIM instance or the PIM instance binding a
   specific VRF.  PIM BSR per-instance configuration container is
   divided into:

   Per-static-RP configuration of the PIM SM instance includes static RP

3.3.4.  Per-Anycast-RP configuration of the PIM SM instance

   Anycast-RP as described in [RFC4610] is a mechanism that pim sm
   register packets have been used to exchange multicast source
   information and get fast convergence when a PIM Rendezvous Point (RP)
   router fails.  Per-Anycast-RP configuration container is divided into
   :

   o  Per-Anycast-RP parameters

   o  Per-RP-peer configuration of PIM SM Anycast RP

3.3.4.1.  Per-Anycast-RP Parameters

   Per-Anycast-RP parameter includes the RP for anycast address, and the
   local address to establish RP peer link.
