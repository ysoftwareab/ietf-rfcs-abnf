Internet-Draft         The IETF Process: a Roadmap        September 2005


1.  Introduction

   BCP 9 [1] has been the basis for the IETF standards process for many
   years.  However, many other process documents exist, some of which
   are partial updates to BCP 9.  This situation is confusing and needs
   to be resolved by a clear set of interlocking documents.  The present
   document suggests a structured way of looking at these documents, and
   some commentary about what already exists or has been proposed.

   It is difficult to linearise a complicated and interlocked process.
   This document presents the roadmap in one particular order, but that
   is not intended to imply priority or importance, and it cannot
   capture all interactions between components.


2.  Outline of roadmap

   For readability of what follows, this section simply lists the
   process document structure.  The following section repeats this
   structure with explanatory text.

      General description of workflow in the IETF
      Definition of standards track and related document types
         Specifications
         Information
         Descriptors
      Intellectual Property
         Rights in Contributions
         Rights in Technology
         Trademarks
      Review and approval process
         Criteria for review
         Criteria for approval
            Appeal process
      Bodies involved in the process
         WG procedures
         IESG
         Review panel TBD
         IAB
            Liaison management
         Nomcom
      Conduct of participants
      Publication process
         Requirements
         Format and mechanics for drafts
         Format and mechanics for archival publications

3.  Details of roadmap

   Note 1: RFC numbers have been used rather than BCP numbers, for
   convenient lookup.  Most of the cited RFCs are BCPs.  Of course, many
   of them may need updating.

   Note 2: Where drafts are cited, it is not implied that they have
   reached consensus.  Internet-Draft citations have not been given in
   detail; see
   https://datatracker.ietf.org/public/idindex.cgi?command=search_id.

   o  General description of workflow in the IETF
      This document does not exist, although the Tao (RFC 3160[20],
      draft-hoffman-taobis) offers hints, but it is needed.
      How ideas for new work enter the IETF, reach a BOF, enter IAB or
      IRTF discussion, and possibly become material for a new or
      existing WG.  How WGs are chartered - the AD role.  How specific
      proposals become drafts and flow through the development, review
      and approval process.

   o  Definition of standards track and related document types.
      This material is currently embedded in RFC 2026[1].  The newtrk WG
      is chartered to revise the standards track - multiple proposals
      have been floated, most recently draft-carpenter-newtrk-twostep
      and draft-loughney-newtrk-one-size-fits-all.
      *  Specifications
         This material is currently embedded in RFC 2026[1], covering
         standards track, BCP and experimental documents.  A variance
         procedure for down-level normative references is in RFC
         3967[2].
      *  Information
         This material is currently embedded in RFC 2026[1], covering
         informational and historic documents.  A distinction between
         obsolete and deprecated documents should probably be added.
      *  Descriptors
         See draft-ietf-newtrk-repurposing-isd and
         draft-otis-newtrk-rfc-set.

         version can be found at
         http://www.alvestrand.no/ietf/gen/art/review-guidelines.html
      *  Criteria for approval
         Material on current IESG practice can be found in
         draft-iesg-discuss-criteria
         +  Appeal process
            This material is currently embedded in RFC 2026[1].

   o  Bodies involved in the process
      Bodies involved, RFC 2028[5]; Defining the IETF, RFC 3233[6];
      Mission Statement, RFC 3935[7].

      RFC 2418[8] and in the Tao (RFC 3160[20], draft-hoffman-taobis).

   o  Publication process
      *  Requirements
         This is intended to be the subject of the techspec BOF in
         Vancouver.
