1.  Introduction

   [RFC7364] and [RFC7365] describe the need and some characteristics of
   the interaction between NVE and NVA. [draft-ietf-nvo3-arch-03] has a
   more detailed architectural description about NVE-NVA protocol.  And
   [draft-ietf-nvo3-nve-nva-cp-req-03] discusses the detail requirements
   of NVE-NVA protocol.

   This draft defines a NVE-NVA protocol, Virtual Network Transport
   Protocol (VNTP).  It belongs to the second model mentioned in [draft-
   ietf-nvo3-arch-03], e.g.  NVE interacts with NVA directly.  It
   defines the interactions between NVE and NVA/NVE and the relevant
   message formats to support virtual network implementation and fulfill
   the requirements described in the related documents mentioned above.

   VNTP can be based on a broad transport mechanism such as TCP or UDP,
   or even IP.  A new TCP/UDP port or protocol number allocation is
   needed if the transport mechanism is decided by NVO3 WG.

3.  VNTP Overview

   VNTP based on some basic assumptions and the main points include:

   1), the first-hand mapping information provided by NVE, either
   configured by administrator or automatically created.
   Architecturally, VNTP also support other mapping resources such as
   downloaded from NVA.

   2), NVE registers to NVA per VN and NVA may store two lists of NVE,
   the first one is all NVEs in a VN and another one is about all the
   VNs NVE resides.

   3), when mapping change occurs in NVE, the NVE send update message to
   NVA to initiate the synchronization procedures and NVA then forward
   the update message to all other NVEs in the same VN.  Optionally, NVA
   can store all the update information for latter use.

   4), when a NVE register to a VN and some update messages received by
   NVA, the NVA may use the messages stored or request the related NVEs
   to send the update again to synchronize.

   5), if NVA obtains the mapping information from other resources
   different from NVE, for example configured by administrator or from
   VM Orchestration, it sends the mapping/update information to all NVEs
   in the same VN.

   The VNTP procedures can be simplified to implement by point-to-point
   communication between NVE and NVA.  So the NVE-NVA interaction can be
   based on a broad transport mechanism such as TCP, UDP or even IP.  A
   new TCP/UDP port or protocol number allocation is needed if the
   transport mechanism is decided.

4.  VNTP Message Format

   Figure 1 shows the VNTP message format.  VNTP message format
   definition is based on some transport mechanism, such as TCP or UDP
   transport protocol, or even based on IP, and further using its data/
   payload field.

   remote NVE.

   NV-ID: The Virtual Network ID that relate to the mapping information.

   Mapping/Address (length variable according AT): each/inner Address

5.  The Operations of NVE

   In the context of VNTP, the NVE works include:

   1), If a VNI is created, the NVE will send Register command to NVA to
   register the VNI/NVE in the VN.

   2), If a VNI is being deleted, the NVE will send update information
   to NVA to inform all the NVE related VN entry will be invalid.  Or
   the NVA gets this information through the keep alive message, then
   nullify the all entries from this NVE_s VN.

   3), If entries in the NVE have changed, for example, a new entry
   added or an existing entry deleted or become invalid, then the NVE
   will send update information to the NVA.  Individual or batch update
   are supported.

   4), And further, NVE also support tenant system migration.

   5), The NVE accepts the updates from NVA and update the VRF table.
   The commands may be individual update or updates resulted from NVE
   failure.

   6), Keep alive.  Monitor the connection between NVE and NVA.

   7), If the command not properly executed retransfer the command again
   for pre-setting times.

   8), When NVA is unavailable or the NVA connection lost, optionally
   the NVE can connect other NVEs in the VN directly to keep the VN
   synchronized.

   9), Security functions.  TBD.

6.  The operations of NVA

   1), VNI creation

   2), Form list of NVEs in the VN based on NVE Registration.

   3), Accept updates from NVE and forward these updates to all other
   NVEs in the VN.  Optionally, NVA store the update information for
   late use.

   4), If NVE not register but update accepted, NVA may register it and
   forward the update to other NVEs.

Internet-Draft                    VNTP                      October 2015


   5), if NVE registering after some updates then NVA will forward the
   stored updates to this NVE.  Or NVA send request message to all other
   registered NVE for update if the previous updates not stored in NVA.
   And the NVA controls the updates only to this NVE other than all
   registered NVEs in the VN.

   6), Keep alive.  Monitor the connection between NVE and NVA.

   7), if the command not properly executed NVA can retransfer the
   command again for pre-setting times.

   8), When NVE in the VN is unavailable or the NVE connection lost,
   optionally the NVA can flood this NVE unreachable information to all
   other NVEs in the VN to keep the VN synchronized.

   9), VNI delete.  If there are not any VM or NVE in the VN, or the
   customer does not need the VN anymore then the NVA delete the VNI and
   release all the resources occupied by this VN.

   10), Security functions.  TBD.

7.  Interaction with TS/Hypervisor-NVE protocol

   Generally, VNTP can run independent of TS/Hypervisor-NVE protocol,
   but the interaction triggered by VRF changes because of the operation
   of TS/Hypervisor-NVE protocol . If the direct interaction is needed
   for further study.

8.  Security Considerations

   VNTP should support NVE and NVA mutual authentication and other
   security functions.  The authentication has been covered by this
   draft, and the further security functions can be support through
   VNTP's command reservations.

9.  IANA/IEEE Considerations

   VNTP needs a specific IP protocol value, or TCP/UDP port allocation
   if the transport mechanism is chosen.
