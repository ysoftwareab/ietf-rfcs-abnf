                    Packet Loss Measurement for SFC 
                draft-sfc-agv-packet-loss-measurement-00


Abstract

   Service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on the
   capability to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet
   loss.

   The common reasons for packet drop are Link Congestion, Device
   (Router/Switch/Firewall/etc.) Performance, Software issues (bugs) on
   a network device, Faulty Hardware or Cabling and Service Function
   processing errors.

   Packet Loss Measurement capability also provides operators with
   greater visibility into the performance characteristics of their
   networks, thereby facilitating planning, troubleshooting, and network
   performance evaluation. 

   This document specifies best possible efficient and accurate
   mechanism for passive packet loss measurement for Service Function
   Chains (SFCs) for a SFC network domain.

INTERNET DRAFT      Packet Loss measurement for SFC    December 11, 2015


1 Introduction

   The delivery of end-to-end services often requires various service
   functions.  These include traditional network service functions such
   as firewalls and traditional IP Network Address Translators (NATs),
   as well as application-specific functions.  The definition and
   instantiation of an ordered set of service functions and subsequent
   "steering" of traffic through them is termed Service Function
   Chaining (SFC).

   The purpose of this memo is to define a mechanism for packet loss
   measurement for Service Function Chains (SFCs)

   As mentioned in [SFC-PM-arch] packet loss measurement could be
   performed using Active Measurement or Passive Measurement method.
   This document describes the Passive Measurement method & active
   measurement method is out of scope of this document. The passive
   packet loss measurement described in this document is realized by
   adding a new Context Header in the Network Service Header.

1.1 Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2 Terms & Definition


   Network Service:  An offering provided by an operator that is
           delivered using one or more service functions.  This may
           also be referred to as a "composite service".  The term
           "service" is used to denote a "network service" in the
           context of this document.

           Note: Beyond this document, the term "service" is overloaded
           with varying definitions.  For example, to some a service is
           an offering composed of several elements within the
           operator's network, whereas for others a service, or more
           specifically a network service, is a discrete element such
           as a "firewall". Traditionally, such services (in the latter
           sense) host a set of service functions and have a network
           locator where the service is hosted.

   Classification:  Locally instantiated matching of traffic flows
           against policy for subsequent application of the required
           set of network service functions.  The policy may be
           customer/network/service specific.

   Classifier:  An element that performs Classification.

   Service Function Chain (SFC):  A service function chain defines an
           ordered set of abstract service functions and ordering
           constraints that must be applied to packets and/or frames
           and/or flows selected as a result of classification.
           An example of an abstract service function is "a firewall".
           The implied order may not be a linear progression as the
           architecture allows for SFCs that copy to more than one
           branch, and also allows for cases where there is flexibility
           in the order in which service functions need to be applied.
           The term "service chain" is often used as shorthand for
           service function chain.

   Service Function (SF):  A function that is responsible for specific
           treatment of received packets.  A Service Function can act
           at various layers of a protocol stack (e.g., at the network
           layer or other OSI layers).  As a logical component, a
           service function can be realized as a virtual element or be
 


AGV                      Expires June 13, 2016                  [Page 5]

INTERNET DRAFT      Packet Loss measurement for SFC    December 11, 2015


           embedded in a physical network element.  One or more Service
           Functions can be embedded in the same network element.
           Multiple occurrences of the service function can exist in
           the same administrative domain.

           One or more service functions can be involved in the
           delivery of added-value services.  A non-exhaustive list of
           abstract service functions includes: firewalls, WAN and
           application acceleration, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI),
           Lawful Intercept (LI), server load balancing, NAT44
           [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146], NPTv6 [RFC6296], HOST_ID
           injection, HTTP Header Enrichment functions, and TCP
           optimizer.

           An SF may be SFC encapsulation aware (that is, it receives
           and acts on information in the SFC encapsulation) or unaware
           (in which case, data forwarded to the SF does not contain
           the SFC encapsulation).  This is often referred to as "SFC
           aware" and "SFC unaware", respectively.

   Service Function Forwarder (SFF):  A service function forwarder
           is responsible for forwarding traffic to one or more
           connected service functions according to information carried
           in the SFC encapsulation, as well as handling traffic coming
           back from the SF.  Additionally, an SFF is responsible for
           delivering traffic to a classifier when needed and supported
           , transporting traffic to another SFF (in the same or
           different type of overlay), and terminating the Service
           Function Path (SFP).

   Metadata:  Provides the ability to exchange context information
           between classifiers and SFs, and among SFs.

   Service Function Path (SFP):  The service function path is a
           constrained specification of where packets assigned to a
           certain service function path must go.  While it may be so
           constrained as to identify the exact locations, it can also
           be less specific.  The SFP provides a level of indirection
           between the fully abstract notion of service chain as a
           sequence of abstract service functions to be delivered, and
           he fully specified notion of exactly which SFF/SFs the
           packet will visit when it actually traverses the network.
           By allowing the control components to specify this level of
           indirection, the operator may control the degree of SFF/SF
           selection authority that is delegated to the network.

   SFC Encapsulation:  The SFC encapsulation provides, at a minimum,
           SFP identification, and is used by the SFC-aware functions,
 


AGV                      Expires June 13, 2016                  [Page 6]

INTERNET DRAFT      Packet Loss measurement for SFC    December 11, 2015


           such as the SFF and SFC-aware SFs.  The SFC encapsulation is
           not used for network packet forwarding.  In addition to SFP
           identification, the SFC encapsulation carries metadata
           including data-plane context information.

   Rendered Service Path (RSP):  Within an SFP, packets themselves
           are of course transmitted from and to specific places in the
           network, visiting a specific sequence of SFFs and SFs.  This
           sequence of actual visits by a packet to specific SFFs and
           SFs in the network is known as the Rendered Service Path
           (RSP). This definition is included here for use by later
           documents, such as when solutions may need to discuss the
           actual sequence of locations the packets visit.

   SFC-Enabled Domain:  A network or region of a network that
           implements SFC.  An SFC-enabled domain is limited to a
           single network administrative domain.

   SFC Proxy:  Removes and inserts SFC encapsulation on behalf of an
           SFC-unaware service function.  SFC proxies are logical
           elements.

   Network Node/Element:  Device that forwards packets or frames
           based  on outer header information. In most cases is not
           aware of the presence of NSH.

   Network Overlay:  Logical network built on top of existing
           network (the underlay).  Packets are encapsulated or
           tunneled to create the overlay network topology.

   Network Service Header:  Data plane header added to frames/
           packets. The header contains information required for
           service chaining, as well as metadata added and consumed by
           network nodes and service elements.

   NSH Proxy:  Acts as a gateway: removes and inserts SH on behalf
           of a service function that is not NSH aware.

   Service Classifier:  Function that performs classification and
           imposes an NSH.  Creates a service path.  Non-initial (i.e.
           subsequent) classification can occur as needed and can alter,
           or create a new service path.

   Measurement Collector : An operational function that collects 
           measurement data from a Measurement Agent. Measurement 
           collector is responsible for collecting the Performance 
           measurement Data from Measurement Agent. Measurement 
           collector functionality could be integrated with one of

           the MA or with the Controller itself. 

   Measurement Agent: An operational function that contains one or
           more Measurement functions. Measurement Agents is 
           responsible for understand and analyze Performance 
           measurement control information encoded in NSH metadata 
           and perform the performance data collecting and report the 
           same to Measurement collector with key information to 
           identify performance measurement instance along with data
           collected.

   Measurement Controller: An operational function that controls
           running, scheduling, and general coordination of Measurement
           functions by instructing a Measurement Agent using NSH
           metadata. Measurement Controller is responsible for 
           Configuring the Performance measurement Instance. 
           Optionally Performance measurement instance can be 
           configured manually at the Ingress in which case 
           Controller is not required

   Base Header: Provides information about service header and payload 
           protocol

   Service Path Header: Provides Path identification and location 
           within a path
   	
   Context Header: Carries opaque metadata and variable length encoded 
           information

   MD Type: Indicates format of NSH beyond Mandatory Base Header and 
           Service Path Header.

1.3 Applicability and Scope

   This document defines the implementation mechanism for the Packet
   Loss Measurement as per Performance Measurement Architecture [SFC-PM-
   arch]. This document defines a new NSH Message Format for carrying
   Packet Loss Measurement related control information. It also defines

3 Operations

3.1 Packet Loss Statistics Counter

   Every MA needs to maintain the packet loss statistics which they
   immediately report it to collector or may accumulate and report to
   collector at a reporting interval which depends on local policy.

   Below 2 packet statistics counters will be created and maintained at
   every MA

   1) Rx-STAT[P][W]

   2) Tx-STAT[P][W]


   Rx-STAT[P][W]: This 2 dimensional statistics counter is maintained at
   every MA. Where P stands for PMF ID and W stands for Window ID. Rx-
   STAT[P][W] counter maintaines the number of packets received for a
   given PMF ID + Window. PMF ID is unique within a SFC Domain, for a
   given PMF ID there could be multiple Windows. Rx-STAT[P][W]
   statistics counter is created when first PM packet for loss
   measurement is received for PMF ID + Window within a Reporting
   interval. Rx-STAT[P][W] statistics counter is deleted at expiry of
   current reporting interval after Rx-STAT[P][W] statistics counters
   are reported to collector.

   Tx-STAT[P][W]: This 2 dimensional statistics counter is maintained at
   every MA. Where P stands for PMF ID and W stands for Window ID. Tx-
   STAT[P][W] counter maintaines the number of packets sent out for a
   given PMF ID + Window. PMF ID is unique within a SFC Domain, for a
   given PMF ID there could be multiple Windows. Tx-STAT[P][W]
   statistics counter is created when first PM packet for loss
   measurement is sent for PMF ID + Window within a Reporting interval.
   Rx-STAT[P][W] statistics counter is deleted at expiry of current
   reporting interval after Tx-STAT[P][W] statistics counters are
   reported to collector.

3.2 Initiating a Packet Loss Measurement 

   Measurement Controller programs the PM Instance at the Classifier.
   Classifier starts the packet classification (based on the
   classification rule/policy). The packet classification policy may be
   customer/network/service specific. Classifier updates/encodes
   corresponding PM Instance for classified packets for each PM Schedule
   in PM Context Header.

3.3 Encapsulation of Classified Packets

   For the classified packet, PM Context Header is prepared with 
   following information

   - Set the Type Class value to the IANA Allocated PM Class.
   - Set the Type Value to the required Packet Loss Measurement type.
   - If Type Value = 0x1
       o Encode the list of Service Index that need to participate in 
         Packet Loss Measurement.
   - If Value = 0x2, 0x3, 0x4, 0x5
       o No need to encode SI, since the type dictates the 
         involved participating MA 
   - Set the Window Identifier as the current running Window number
   - Encode the 32 bit globally unique PMF ID using the Flow Id 
     Context Header as defined in [I-D quinn-sfc-nsh-tlv].


3.4 Incoming Packets Processing at MA

   On receiving the packet with NSH header following operations are 
   carried out:

   Step 1: Detection of PM Context Header in a packet, by verifying 
           the PM TLV Class as allocated by IANA.
           (If not detected, move to step 6)

   Step 2: Check if PM Type field value is 1 to 5. 
           (If not move to step 6).

   Step 3: If PM Type Value = 2 to 5 move directly to Step 5

   Step 4: Check Presence of self Service index in Service Index List.
           (If not present, move to step 6)

   Step 5: Record the value of PMF ID and Window ID; Increment the value
           of statistics counter Rx-STAT[P][W] by 1. If statistics 
           counter doesn't exist, create it and initialize it with 1.

   Step 6: Packet is sent for Normal Processing

3.5 Outgoing Packets Processing at MA

   At outgoing port of MA following operations are carried out.

   Step 1: Record the value of PMF ID and Window ID; Increment the value
           of statistics counter Tx-STAT[P][W] by 1. If statistics 
           counter doesn't exist, create it and initialize it with 1.

   Step 2: Packet is sent for Normal Processing

3.6 MA Reporting the statistics to Collector

   Reporting timer will run on Each MA. Consistency of this timer 
   should be ensured across the entire MA in the SFP, ensuring the
   same is out of scope of this document. 

   On expiry of this timer following information needs to be sent
   to the Collector.

       - Service Index 
       - PM Type Value
       - Value of all the accumulated Tx-STAT[P][W] statistics 
         counter along with the corresponding PMF ID and Window Id 
       - Value of all the accumulated Rx-STAT[P][W] statistics counter
         along with the corresponding PMF ID and Window Id

   MA may delete the Tx-STAT[P][W], Rx-STAT[P][W] after sending the 
   same to collector.

3.7 Packet Loss Calculation at Collector

   Collector accumulates the statistics counters per PMF per MA per
   Window. On receipt of report from a MA for a PMF if it has statistics
   related for an already collected window, received statistics will be
   summed up, otherwise a new entry is created. Collector computes the
   Packet Loss using the accumulated statistics per PMF per MA per
   Window.

   Packet Loss between MA (for example from MA1 to MA2) = (MA1)Tx-
   STAT[P][W] - (MA2)Rx-STAT[P][W]

   Packet Loss at MA = (MA)Tx-STAT[P][W] - (MA)Rx-STAT[P][W]
