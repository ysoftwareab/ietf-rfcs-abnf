     Seamless Interconnect Underlay to Cloud Overlay Problem Statement
                  draft-dm-net2cloud-problem-statement-05

Abstract

   This document describes the problems of enterprises face today in
   connecting their branch offices to dynamic workloads in third party
   data centers (a.k.a. Cloud DCs).

   It examines the approach of using SD-WAN to utilize multiple
   underlay networks by different providers to maximize or optimize
   interconnection among branch offices, on-premises DCs and Hybrid
   Cloud DCs.

   This document also describes some of the (network) problems that
   many enterprises face when they have workloads & applications & data
   split among hybrid data centers, especially for those enterprises
   with multiple sites that are already interconnected by VPNs (e.g.
   MPLS L2VPN/L3VPN) and leased lines.

   Current operational problems in the field are examined to determine
   whether there is a need for enhancements to existing protocols or
   whether a new protocol is necessary to solve them.

1. Introduction

   Cloud applications and services continue to change how businesses of
   all sizes work and share information. "Cloud applications &
   workloads" are those that are instantiated in third party DCs that
   also host services for other customers.

   With the advent of widely available third party cloud DCs in diverse
   geographic locations and the advancement of tools for monitoring and
   predicting application behaviors, it is technically feasible for
   enterprises to instantiate applications and workloads in locations
   that are geographically closest to their end users. This property
   aids in improving end-to-end latency and overall user experience.
   Conversely, an enterprise can easily shutdown applications and
   workloads when their end users' geographic base changes (therefore
   needing to change the networking connection to those relocated
   applications and workloads). In addition, an enterprise may wish to

Internet-Draft        Net2Cloud Problem Statement          January 2019


   take advantage of more and more business applications offered by
   third party private cloud DCs, such as Dropbox, Microsoft365, SAP
   HANA, Oracle Cloud, Salesforce Cloud, etc.

   Most of those enterprise branch offices & on-premises data centers
   are already connected via VPNs, such as MPLS based l2VPN/L3VPN. Then
   connecting to the cloud-based resources may not be straightforward
   if the provider of the VPN service does not have direct connections
   to the cloud DCs. Under those circumstances, the enterprise can
   upgrade their existing CPEs to utilize SD-WAN to reach cloud
   resources (without any assistance from the VPN service provider), or
   wait for their VPN service provider to make new agreements with data
   center providers to connect to the Cloud resources. Either way has
   additional infrastructure and operational costs.

   In addition, it is an uptrend with more enterprises instantiating
   their Apps & workloads in different Cloud DCs to maximize the
   benefits of geographical convenience, elasticity and special
   features offered by different Cloud DCs.

2. Definition of terms

   Cloud DC:   Third party Data Centers that usually host applications
               and workload owned by different organizations or
               tenants.

   Controller: Used interchangeably with SD-WAN controller to manage
               SD-WAN overlay path creation/deletion and monitoring the
               path conditions between two or more sites.

   DSVPN:      Dynamic Smart Virtual Private Network. DSVPN is a secure
               network that exchanges data between sites without
               needing to pass traffic through an organization's
               headquarter virtual private network (VPN) server or
               router.

   Heterogeneous Cloud: applications & workloads split among Cloud DCs
               owned & managed by different operators.

Internet-Draft        Net2Cloud Problem Statement          January 2019


   Hybrid Cloud: On premise DC plus Cloud DCs owned and managed by
               different organizations. In this document Hybrid Cloud
               also include heterogeneous cloud as well.

   SD-WAN:     Software Defined Wide Area Network, which can mean many
               different things. In this document, "SD-WAN" refers to
               the solutions specified by ONUG (Open Network User
               Group), https://www.onug.net/software-defined-wide-area-
               network-sd-wan/, which is about pooling WAN bandwidth
               from multiple underlay networks to get better WAN
               bandwidth management, visibility & control. Some of the
               underlay networks are private networks over which
               traffic can traverse without encryption, others requires
               IPsec tunnels between SD-WAN nodes to carry the traffic.

   VPC:        Virtual Private Cloud. A service offered by many Cloud
               DC operators to allocate a logically isolated cloud
               resources, including compute, networking and storage.

3. Current Practices in Interconnecting Enterprise Sites with Cloud DCs


3.1. Interconnect to Cloud DCs

   Most Cloud operators offer some type of network gateway through
   which an enterprise can reach their workloads hosted in the Cloud
   DCs. For example, AWS (Amazon Web Services) offers the following
   options to reach workloads in AWS Cloud DCs:

     - Internet gateway for any external entities to reach the
        workloads hosted in AWS Cloud DC via the internet.
     - Virtual gateway (vGW) to which IPsec tunnels [RFC6071] are
        established between an enterprise's own gateways and AWS vGW,
        so that the communications between those gateways can be
        secured from the underlay (which might be the public internet).
     - Direct Connect, which allows enterprises to purchase direct
        connect from network service providers to get a private leased
        line interconnecting the enterprises gateway(s) and the AWS
        Direct Connect routers co-located with the network operators.

Internet-Draft        Net2Cloud Problem Statement          January 2019


        Via Direct Connect, AWS Transit Gateway can be utilized to
        interconnect multiple VPCs in different Availability Zones.

   CPEs at one Enterprise branch office can have ports facing internet
   to connect to AWS's vGW via IPsec and other ports connected to AWS
   DirectConnect via private network (without encryption).

     Figure 1: Examples of connecting to a Cloud DC


3.2. Interconnect to Hybrid Cloud DCs

   According to Gartner, by 2020 "hybrid will be the most common usage
   of the cloud" as more enterprises see the benefits of integrating
   public and private cloud infrastructures. However, enabling the
   growth of hybrid cloud deployments in the enterprise requires fast
   and safe interconnection between public and private cloud services.
   The Hybrid Cloud scenario also includes heterogeneous Cloud DCs,
   meaning Cloud DCs owned and managed by different organizations.

   For an enterprise to connect to applications & workloads hosted in
   multiple Cloud DCs, the enterprise can use IPsec tunnels over
   internet or/and lease private networks to connect its on-premises
   gateways to each of the Cloud DC's gateways, virtual routers
   instantiated in the Cloud DCs,  or any other suitable design
   (including a combination thereof).

   Some enterprises prefer to instantiate their own virtual
   CPEs/routers inside the Cloud DC to connect the workloads within the
   Cloud DC. Then an overlay path is established between customer
   gateways to the virtual CPEs/routers for reaching the workloads
   inside the cloud DC.



3.3. Connecting workloads among hybrid Cloud DCs

   There are multiple approaches to interconnect workloads among
   different Cloud DCs:

     - Utilize Cloud DCs provided transit gateways, which usually does
        not work if Cloud DCs are owned and managed by different Cloud
        providers.
     - Hairpin all the traffic through the customer gateway, which
        creates additional transmission delay & incurs cost exiting
        Cloud DCs, or
     - Establish direct tunnels among different VPCs (Virtual Private
        Clouds) via client's own virtual routers instantiated within
        Cloud DCs. Using DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private

        Network) or DSVPN (Dynamic Smart VPN) to establish direct
        Multi-edge tunnels among those client's own virtual routers.

   DMVPN & DSVPN use NHRP (Next Hop Resolution Protocol) [RFC2735] so
   that spoke nodes can register their IP addresses & WAN ports with
   the hub node. The IETF ION (Internetworking over NBMA (non-broadcast
   multiple access) WG, standardized NHRP for connection-oriented NBMA
   network (such as ATM) network address resolution more than two
   decades ago.

   There are many differences between virtual routers in Public Cloud
   DCs and the nodes in an NBMA network. NHRP & DSVPN are not effective
   in registering virtual routers in Cloud DCs without major extension.
   Another option is using other protocols such as BGP approach
   described in [BGP-SDWAN]. As the result of this evaluation,
   enhancement or new protocols for distributing edge node/port
   properties may come out.



4. Desired Properties for Networks that interconnects Hybrid Clouds
   The networks that interconnect hybrid Cloud DCs have to enable users
   to take advantage of Cloud DCs:
     - High availability, any time usage for any length of time.
        Many enterprises incorporate Cloud as their disaster recovery
        strategy, e.g. periodically backup data into the cloud, or
        running backup applications in the Cloud, etc. Therefore, the
        connection to the cloud DCs may not be permanent, but rather
        needs to be on-demand.

     - Global accessibility in different geographical zones, thereby
        facilitating the proximity of applications as a function of the
        end users' location, for improved latency.
     - Elasticity and mobility, to instantiate additional applications
        at Cloud DCs when end users' usages increase and shut down
        applications at locations with fewer end users.
        Some enterprises have front-end web portals running in Cloud
        DCs and Database servers in their on-premises DCs. Those Front-
        end web portals need to be reachable from the public Internet.
        The backend connection to the sensitive data in database
        servers hosted in the on-premises DCs might need secure
        connections.


Dunbar, et al.           Expires Dec 24, 2019                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        Net2Cloud Problem Statement          January 2019


     - Scalable security management. IPsec is commonly used to
        interconnect Cloud GW with enterprises on-premises GWs. For
        enterprises with large number or branch offices, managing the
        IPsec's pair-wise security associations among many nodes can be
        very difficult.


5. Problems with MPLS-based VPNs extending to Hybrid Cloud DCs

   Traditional MPLS-based VPNs have been widely deployed as an
   effective way to support businesses and organizations that require
   network performance and reliability. MPLS shifted the burden of
   managing a VPN service from enterprises to service providers. The
   CPEs attached to MPLS VPN are also simpler and less expensive, since
   they do not need to manage routes to remote sites; they simply pass
   all outbound traffic to the MPLS VPN PEs to which the CPEs are
   attached (albeit multi-homing scenarios require more processing
   logic on CPEs).  MPLS has addressed the problems of scale,
   availability, and fast recovery from network faults, and
   incorporated traffic-engineering capabilities.

   However, traditional MPLS-based VPN solutions are not optimized for
   connecting end-users to dynamic workloads/applications in cloud DCs
   because:

     - The Provider Edge (PE) nodes of the enterprise's VPNs might not
        have direct connection to the third party cloud DCs that are
        optimal for hosting workloads with the goal of easy access to
        enterprises' end users.

     - It takes a relatively long time to deploy provider edge (PE)
        routers at new locations. When enterprise's workloads are
        changed from one cloud DC to another (i.e., removed from one DC
        and re-instantiated to another location when demand changes),
        the enterprise branch offices need to be connected to the new
        cloud DC, but the network service provider might not have PEs
        located at the new location.

        One of the main drivers for moving workloads into the cloud is
        the widely available cloud DCs at geographically diverse
        locations, where apps can be instantiated so that they can be


Dunbar, et al.           Expires Dec 24, 2019                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft        Net2Cloud Problem Statement          January 2019


        as close to their end users as possible. When the user base
        changes, the applications may be moved to a new cloud DC
        location closest to the new user base.

     - Most of the cloud DCs do not expose their internal networks, so
        the provider MPLS based VPNs cannot reach the workloads
        natively.

     - Many cloud DCs use an overlay to connect their gateways to the
        workloads inside the DC. There has not been any standard to
        address the interworking between the Cloud Overlay and the
        enterprise' existing underlay networks.

   Another roadblock is the lack of a standard way to express and
   enforce consistent security policies to workloads that not only use
   virtual addresses, but also have a high chance of placement in
   different locations within the Cloud DC [RFC8192]. The traditional
   VPN path computation and bandwidth allocation schemes may not be
   flexible enough to address the need for enterprises to rapidly
   connect to dynamically instantiated (or removed) workloads and
   applications regardless of their location/nature (i.e., third party
   cloud DCs).

6. Problem with using IPsec tunnels to Cloud DCs
   As described in the previous section, many Cloud operators expose
   their gateways for external entities (which can be enterprises
   themselves) to directly establish IPsec tunnels. Enterprises can
   also instantiate virtual routers within Cloud DCs to connect to its
   on-premises devices via IPsec tunnels. If there is only one
   enterprise location that needs to reach the Cloud DC, an IPsec
   tunnel is a very convenient solution.

   However, many medium-to-large enterprises usually have multiple
   sites and multiple data centers. For workloads and apps hosted in
   Cloud DCs, multiple sites need to communicate securely with those
   Cloud workloads and apps. This section documents some of the issues
   associated with using IPsec tunnels to connect enterprise' sites
   with Cloud operator's Gateways.

Internet-Draft        Net2Cloud Problem Statement          January 2019


6.1. Complexity of multi-point any-to-any interconnection

   The dynamic workload instantiated in cloud DC needs to communicate
   with multiple branch offices and on-premises data centers. Most
   enterprises need multi-point interconnection among multiple
   locations, as done by MPLS L2/L3 VPNs.

   Using IPsec overlay paths to connect all branches & on-premises data
   centers to cloud DCs requires CPEs to manage routing among Cloud DCs
   gateways and the CPEs located at other branch locations, which can
   dramatically increase the complexity of the design, possibly at the
   cost of jeopardizing the CPE performance.

   The complexity of requiring CPEs to maintain routing among other
   CPEs is one of the reasons why enterprises migrated from Frame Relay
   based services to MPLS-based VPN services.

   MPLS-based VPNs have their PEs directly connected to the CPEs.
   Therefore, CPEs only need to forward all traffic to the directly
   attached PEs, which are therefore responsible for enforcing the
   routing policy within the corresponding VPNs. Even for multi-homed
   CPEs, the CPEs only need to forward traffic among the directly
   connected PEs (note: the complexity may vary for IPv6 network).
   However, when using IPsec tunnels between CPEs and Cloud DCs, the
   CPEs need to manage the routing for traffic to Cloud DCs, to remote
   CPEs via VPN, or directly.

6.2. Poor performance over long distance

   When enterprise CPEs or gateways are far away from Cloud DC gateways
   or across country/continent boundaries, performance of IPsec tunnels
   over the public Internet can be problematic and unpredictable. Even
   though there are many monitoring tools available to measure delay
   and various performance characteristics of the network, the
   measurement for paths over the Internet is passive and past
   measurements may not represent future performance.

   Many cloud providers can replicate workloads in different available
   zones. An App instantiated in a Cloud DC closest to clients may have
   to cooperate with another App (or its mirror image) in another
   region or database server(s) in the on-premises DC. This kind of
   coordination requires predicable networking behavior/performance
   among those locations.

Internet-Draft        Net2Cloud Problem Statement          January 2019


6.3. Scaling Issues with IPsec Tunnels

   IPsec can achieve secure overlay connections between two locations
   over any underlay networks, e.g., between CPEs and Cloud DC
   Gateways.

   If there is only one enterprise location connected to the Cloud
   gateway, a small number of IPsec tunnels can be configured on-demand
   between the on-premises DC and the Cloud DC, which is an easy and
   flexible solution.

   However, for multiple enterprise locations to reach workloads hosted
   in cloud DCs, the Cloud DC gateway needs to maintain multiple IPsec
   tunnels to all those locations (e.g. hub & spoke topology). For a
   company with hundreds or thousands of locations, there could be
   hundreds (or even thousands) of IPsec tunnels terminating at the
   Cloud DC gateway, which is not only very expensive (because Cloud
   Operators charge based on connections), but can be very processing
   intensive for the gateway. Many cloud operators only allow a limited
   number of IPsec tunnels & bandwidth to each customer.
   Alternatively, you could use a solution like group encryption where
   a single IPSec SA is necessary at the GW but the drawback here is
   key distribution and maintenance of a key server etc.

7. Problems of Using SD-WAN to connect to Cloud DCs
   SD-WAN can establish parallel paths over multiple underlay networks
   between two locations on-demand, for example, two CPEs
   interconnected by a traditional MPLS VPN ([RFC4364] or [RFC4664]) as
   well as IPsec [RFC6071] overlay tunnels over Internet.

   SD-WAN lets enterprises augment their current VPN network with cost-
   effective, readily available Broadband Internet connectivity,
   enabling some traffic offloaded to paths over Internet based on
   traffic forwarding policy (application-based or otherwise), or when
   the MPLS VPN connection between the two locations is congested, or
   otherwise undesirable or unavailable.

7.1. SD-WAN among branch offices vs. interconnect to Cloud DCs

   SD-WAN interconnection of branch offices is not as simple as it
   appears. For an enterprise with multiple sites, using SD-WAN overlay
   paths among sites requires each CPE to manage all the addresses that
   local hosts have the potential to reach, i.e. map internal VPN
   addresses to appropriate SD-WAN paths. This is similar to the

Internet-Draft        Net2Cloud Problem Statement          January 2019


   complexity of Frame Relay based VPNs, where each CPE needed to
   maintain mesh routing for all destinations if they were to avoid an
   extra hop through a hub router. Even though SD-WAN CPEs can get
   assistance from a central controller (instead of running a routing
   protocol) to resolve the mapping between destinations and SD-WAN
   paths, SD-WAN CPEs are still responsible for routing table
   maintenance as remote destinations change their attachments, e.g.,
   the dynamic workload in other DCs are de-commissioned or added.

   Even though originally envisioned for interconnecting branch
   offices, SD-WAN offers a very attractive way for enterprises to
   connect to Cloud DCs.

   The SD-WAN for interconnecting branch offices and the SD-WAN for
   interconnecting to Cloud DCs have some differences:

     - SD-WAN for interconnecting branch offices usually have two end-
        points (e.g. CPEs) controlled by one entity (e.g., a controller
        or management system operated by the enterprise).
     - SD-WAN for interconnecting to Cloud DCs may have CPEs owned or
        managed by the enterprise and remote end-points being managed
        or controlled by Cloud DCs (For the ease of description, let's
        call it asymmetrically managed CPEs).

     - Cloud DCs may have different entering points (or devices) with
        one terminating private direct connect (such as MPLS, or direct
        line) and other points being the device terminating the IPsec
        tunnels, as shown in the following diagram.

     Therefore, the SD-WAN becomes asymmetric.

8. End-to-End Security Concerns for Data Flows

     When IPsec tunnels from enterprise on-premises CPEs are terminated
     at the Cloud DC gateway where the workloads or applications are
     hosted, some enterprises have concerns regarding traffic to/from
     their workload being exposed to others behind the data center
     gateway (e.g., exposed to other organizations that have workloads
     in the same data center).
     To ensure that traffic to/from workloads is not exposed to
     unwanted entities; it is worthwhile to consider having the IPsec
     tunnels go all the way to the workload (servers, or VMs) within
     the DC.


9. Requirements for Dynamic Cloud Data Center VPNs

   [Editor's note: this section is only a place holder. The requirement
   listed here are only to stimulate more discussions]

   In order to address the aforementioned issues, any solution for
   enterprise VPNs that includes connectivity to dynamic workloads or
   applications in cloud data centers should satisfy a set of
   requirements:

     - The solution should allow enterprises to take advantage of the
        current state-of-the-art in VPN technology, in both traditional
        MPLS-based VPNs and IPsec-based VPNs (or any combination
        thereof) that run over-the-top of the public Internet.
     - The solution should not require an enterprise to upgrade all
        their existing CPEs.
     - The solution should support scalable IPsec key management among
        all the nodes.
     - The solution needs to support easy and fast VPN connections to
        dynamic workloads and applications in third party data centers,
        and easily allow these workloads to migrate both within a data
        center and between data centers.
     - Allow VPNs to provide bandwidth and other performance
        guarantees.

     - Be a cost-effective solution for enterprises to incorporate
        dynamic cloud-based applications and workloads into their
        existing VPN environment.



10. Security Considerations

   This draft describes the problem space of using SD-WAN to
   interconnect branch offices with Cloud DCs. As it is a problem
   statement, the draft itself does not introduce any security
   concerns. The draft does discuss security requirements as a part of
   the problem space, particularly in sections 4, 5, and 8.

11. Solution drafts resulting from this work will address particular
   security concerns inherent in the solution(s), including both
   protocol aspects and the importance (for example) of securing
   workloads in cloud DCs and the use of secure interconnection
   mechanisms.IANA Considerations
