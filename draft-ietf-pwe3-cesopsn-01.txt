1. Introduction 
 
This document describes a method for structure-aware encapsulation 
structured of NxDS0 TDM signals as pseudo-wires over packet-switching 
networks (PSN). In this regard, it complements similar work for for 
structure-agnostic emulation of TDM bit-streams [PWE3-SAToP]. 
 
Ability to emulate NxDS0 circuits provides for saving PSN bandwidth, 
supports DS0-level grooming and distributed cross-connect applications. 
It also enhances resilience of CE devices to effects of loss of packets 
in the PSN. 
 
The CESoPSN solution presented in this document fits the PWE3 
architecture described in [PWE3-ARCH], satisfies the general 
requirements put forward in [PWE3-REQ] and specific requirements for 
structured TDM emulation put forward in [PWE3-TDM-REQ].

   Structured TDM Circuit Emulation Service over PSN         July 2004 
          
 
This document uses some terms and acronyms that are commonly used in 
conjunction with the TDM services. In particular: 
 
o  Loss of Signal (LOS) is a common term denoting a condition 
    where a valid TDM signal cannot be extracted from the 
    physical layer of the trunk. Actual criteria for detecting 
    and clearing LOS are described in [G.775] 
o  Frame Alignment Signal (FAS) is a common term denoting a 
    special periodic pattern that is used to impose TDM 
    structures on E1, T1, E3 and T3 circuits. Actual FAS 
    patterns are described in [G.704] (E1, T1 and T3) and 
    [G.751] (E3) 
o  Out of Frame Synchronization (OOF) is a common term 
    denoting the state of the receiver of a TDM signal when it 
    failed to find valid FAS. Actual criteria for declaring and 
    clearing OOF are described in [G.706]. Handling of this 
    condition includes invalidation of the TDM data 
o  Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) is a common term denoting a 
    special bit pattern in the TDM bit stream that indicates 
    presence of an upstream circuit outage. Actual criteria for 
    declaring and clearing the AIS condition in a TDM stream 
    are defined in [G.775] 
o  Remote Alarm Indication (RAI) and Remote Defect Indication 
    (RDI) are common terms (often used as synonyms) denoting a 
    special pattern in the framing of a TDM service that is 
    sent back by the receiver that experiences an AIS 
    condition. This condition cannot be detected while a LOS, 
    OOF or AIS condition is detected. Specific rules for 
    encoding this pattern in the TDM framing are discussed in 
    [G.775] 
o  Channel-Associated Signaling (CAS) is a common term 
    describing one of the methods of exchanging signals between 
    telephony applications. CAS is based on allocation of up to 
    4 constant-rate synchronous bit-streams for each Voice-
    carrying DS0 channel in an E1 or T1 trunk. (These bit-
    streams are commonly denoted A, B, C and D.) The actual 
    methods of carrying the sets of these bit streams 
    isochronously in an E1 or T1 trunk and establishing 
    association between a specific DS0 channel with an 
    appropriate set of these bit streams are described in 
    [G.704].  
 
Note: CAS can be interpreted in two different ways. A "synchronous" 
interpretation treats it as a set of synchronous bit-streams, while a 
"signaling" interpretation treats it as a method to encode signals 
reflecting change of state of telephony applications based upon 
generation and detection of certain stable bit patterns in the CAS-
related bit-streams. The most commonly used patterns include "stable 
ones" and "stable zeroes"; (i.e., two states per bit-stream); in some 
cases they are augmented by a "stable alternate pattern" (providing the 
3rd state of the bit-stream). The combination of these patterns allows

   Structured TDM Circuit Emulation Service over PSN         July 2004 
          
encoding of up to 16 different telephony application states. Most 
modern E1 and T1 framers support both approaches by providing: 
 
1. For the synchronous approach - dedicated pins that allow 
    extraction/insertion of the relevant constant-rate bit-streams into 
    appropriate positions in the E1 or T1 trunk 
2. For the signaling approach: 
    a) Dedicated memory-mapped registers which allow reading the actual 
       stabilized CAS bits values and writing the desired combination 
       of CAS bits values to be inserted into the resulting E1 or T1 
       trunk 
    b) Generation of interrupts when a de-bounced change of CAS bits 
       has been detected. 
 
Note: Another method of exchanging signals between telephony 
applications is called Common Channel Signaling (CCS). This method is 
not considered in this document in detail. 
 
   2.2. Reference Models 
 
Generic models that have been defined in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4 of 
[PWE3-ARCH] are fully applicable for the purposes of this document 
without any modifications. 
 
The Network Synchronization reference model and deployment scenarios 
for emulation of TDM services have been described in [PWE3-TDM-REQ], 
Section 4.2. 
 
Structured services considered in this document represent special cases 
of the structured bit stream payload type defined in Section 3.3.4 of 
[PWE3-ARCH]. In each specific case the basic service structures that 
are preserved by a CESoPSN PW are explicitly specified (see Section 3 
below). 
 
In accordance with the principle of minimum intervention ([PWE3-ARCH], 
Section 3.3.5) the TDM payload is encapsulated without any changes.  
 
   2.3. Requirements and Design Constraint 
 
The CESoPSN protocol has been designed in order to meet the following 
design constrains: 
 
1. Fixed amount of TDM data per packet: All the packets belonging to a 
    given CESoPSN PW MUST carry the same amount of TDM data. This 
    approach simplifies compensation of a lost PW packet with a packet 
    carrying exactly the same amount of "replacement" TDM data 
2. Fixed end-to-end delay: CESoPSN implementations SHOULD provide the 
    same end-to-end delay between any given pair of PEs regardless of 
    the bit-rate of the emulated service. 
3. Packetization latency range: 
    a) All the implementations of CESoPSN SHOULD support packetization 
       latencies in the range 1 to 5 milliseconds  
 

   Vainshtein et al.           Expires   January 2005          [Page 4]

 
   Structured TDM Circuit Emulation Service over PSN         July 2004 
          
    b) CESoPSN implementations that support configurable packetization 
       latency MUST allow configuration of this parameter with the 
       granularity which is a multiple of 125 microseconds  
4. Common data path for services with and without CE application 
    signaling: if, in addition to TDM data, CE signaling must be 
    transferred between a pair of CE devices for the normal operation 
    of the emulated service, this signaling is passed in dedicated 
    signaling packets specific for the signaling protocol while format 
    and processing of the packets carrying TDM data remains unchanged. 
       
3. Emulated Services 
 
In accordance with [PWE3-TDM-REQ], structured services considered in 
this specification are NxDS0 services with and without CAS.  
 
NxDS0 services are usually carried within appropriate physical trunks, 
and PEs providing their emulation include appropriate Native Service 
Processing (NSP) blocks commonly referred to as Framers.  
 
The NSPs may also act as digital cross-connects, creating structured 
TDM services from multiple synchronous trunks. As a consequence, the 
service may contain more timeslots that could be carried over any 
single trunk, or the timeslots may not originate from any single trunk. 
 
The reference PE architecture supporting these services is described in 
Annex B.  
 
This document defines a single format for packets carrying TDM data 
regardless of the need to carry CAS or any other CE application 
signaling. The resulting "basic NxDS0 service" can be extended to carry 
CE application signaling (e.g. CAS) using separate signaling packets. 
Signaling packets MAY be carried in the same PW as the packets carrying 
TDM data or in a separate dedicated PW. 
 
In addition, this document also defines dedicated formats for carrying 
NxDS0 services with CAS in signaling sub-structures in some of the 
packets. These formats effectively differ for NxDS0 services that 
originated in different trunks so that their usage results in emulating 
trunk-specific NxDS0 services with CAS. 
 
PW Types for the corresponding CESoPSN PWs are defined in [PWE3-IANA]. 
 
 
4. CESoPSN Encapsulation Layer 
   4.1. CESoPSN Packet Format  
 
The CESoPSN header MUST contain the CESoPSN Control Word (4 bytes) and 
MAY also contain a fixed RTP header [RFC3550]. If the RTP header is 
included in the CESoPSN header, it MUST immediately precede the CESoPSN 
control word in case of an IPv4 or IPv6 PSN, and MUST immediately 
follow it in the case of an MPLS PSN (see Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b below).

   Structured TDM Circuit Emulation Service over PSN         July 2004 
          
Note: Such an arrangement complies with the traditional usage of RTP 
for the IPv4/IPv6 PSN while allowing correct operation of CESoPSN PWs 
over routers that discriminate packet type on the basis of the first 
four bits of the packet, as described in [PWE3-ARCH], section 5.4.3). 
 
Note: Both UDP and L2TPv3 can provide the multiplexing mechanisms for 
CESoPSN PWs over an IPv4/IPv6 PSN.

   4.2. PSN and Multiplexing Layer Headers 
 
The total size of a CESoPSN packet for a specific PW MUST NOT exceed 
path MTU between the pair of PEs terminating this PW.  
 
CESoPSN implementations working with IPv4 PSN MUST set the "Don't 
Fragment" flag in IP headers of the packets they generate. 
 
Usage of MPLS and L2TPv3 as demultiplexing layers is explained in 
[PWE3-ARCH] and [L2TPv3] respectively. 
 
Usage of UDP as the multiplexing mechanism is compliant with the 
traditional method used for multiplexing RTP flows, e.g.: 
 
1. Each PE: 
    a) Allocates one of the PE own IP addresses and a single UDP port 
       for each local PW end point (CESoPSN IWF instance)  
    b) Is aware (by configuration or via a signaling protocol) of the 
       similar allocations associated with the remote peer PW end 
       points 
2. Each CESoPSN IWF instance uses the associated locally and remotely 
    allocated UDP ports as correspondingly the Source and Destination 
    UDP ports in all the CESoPSN packets its generates.

L - if set, indicates some abnormal condition of the 
    attachment circuit. 
M - a 2-bit modifier field. In case of L cleared allows 
    discrimination of signaling packets, carrying RDI of the 
    attachment circuit across the PSN etc. In case of L set 
    only the '00' value is currently defined, other values are 
    reserved for future extensions. L and M bits can be 
    treated as a 3-bit code point space that is described in 
    detail in Table 1 below 
 
R - if set by the PSN-bound IWF, indicates that its local CE-bound 
    IWF is in the packet loss state, i.e. has lost a preconfigured 
    number of consecutive packets. The R bit MUST be cleared by the 
    PSN-bound IWF once its local CE-bound IWF has exited the packet

with the rules defined in [RFC3550], Section 5 for the RTP sequence 
number.  
 
   4.4. Usage of the RTP header 
 
When a fixed RTP header (see [RFC3550], Section 5.1) is used with 
CESoPSN, its fields are used in the following way: 
 
1. V (version) is always set to 2 
2. P (padding), X (header extension), CC (CSRC count) and M (marker) 
    are always set to 0 
3. PT (payload type) is used as following: 
    a) One PT value MUST be allocated from the range of dynamic values 
       (see [RTP-TYPES]) for each direction of the PW. The same PT 
       value MAY be reused for both directions of the PW and also 
       reused between different PWs 
    b) The PE at the PW ingress MUST set the PT field in the RTP header 
       to the allocated value  
    c) The PE at the PW egress MAY use the received value to detect 
       malformed packets 
4. Sequence number in the RTP header MUST be equal to the sequence 
    number in the CESoPSN CW 
5. Timestamps are used for carrying timing information over the 
    network: 
    a) Their values are generated in accordance with the rules 
       established in [RFC3550]  
    b) Frequency of the clock used for generating timestamps MUST be an 
       integer multiple of 8 kHz. All implementations of CESoPSN MUST 
       support the 8 kHz clock. Other frequencies that are integer 
       multiples of 8 kHz MAY be used if both sides agree to that 
    c) Possible modes of timestamp generation are discussed below 
6. The SSRC (synchronization source) value in the RTP header MAY be 
    used for detection of misconnections. 
 
The RTP header in CESoPSN can be used in conjunction with at least the 
following modes of timestamp generation: 
 
1. Absolute mode: the ingress PE sets timestamps using the clock 
    recovered from the incoming TDM circuit. As a consequence, the 
    timestamps are closely correlated with the sequence numbers. All 
    CESoPSN implementations MUST support this mode  
2. Differential mode: PE devices connected by the PW have access to 
    the same high-quality synchronization source, and this 
    synchronization source is used for timestamp generation. As a 
    consequence, the second derivative of the timestamp series 
    represents the difference between the common timing source and the 
    clock of the incoming TDM circuit. Support of this mode is 
    OPTIONAL. 
 
5. CESoPSN Payload Layer 
   5.1. Common Payload Format Considerations 
 
 

   Vainshtein et al.           Expires   January 2005          [Page 9]

 
   Structured TDM Circuit Emulation Service over PSN         July 2004 
          
All the services considered in this document are treated as sequences 
of "basic structures" (see Section 3 above). The payload of a CESoPSN 
packet always consists of a fixed number of octets filled, octet by 
octet, with the data contained in the corresponding consequent basic 
structures preserving octet alignment between these structures and the 
packet payload boundaries in accordance with the following rules: 
 
1. The order of the payload octets corresponds to their order on the 
    TDM AC. 
2. Consecutive bits coming from the TDM AC fill each payload octet 
    starting from its most significant bit to the least significant 
    one. 
3. All the CESoPSN packets MUST carry the same amount of valid TDM 
    data in both directions of the PW. In other words, the time that is 
    required to fill a CESoPSN packet with the TDM data must be 
    constant. The PE devices terminating a CESoPSN PW MUST agree on the 
    number of TDM payload octets in the PW packets for both directions 
    of the PW at the time of the PW setup. 
 
Notes:  
1. CESoPSN packets MAY omit invalid TDM data in order to save the PSN 
    BW. If the CESoPSN packet payload is omitted, the L bit in the 
    CESoPSN control word MUST be set 
2. CESoPSN PWs MAY carry CE signaling information either in separate 
    packets or appended to packets carrying valid TDM data. If 
    signaling information and valid TDM data are carried in the same 
    CESoPSN packet, the amount of the former does not affect the amount 
    of the latter. 
 
   5.2. Basic NxDS0 Services  
 
As mentioned above, the basic structure preserved across the PSN for 
this service consists of n octets filled with the data of the 
corresponding DS0 channels belonging to the same frame of the 
originating trunk(s), and the service generates 8000 such structures 
per second.  
 
CESoPSN MUST use alignment of the basic structures with the packet 
payload boundaries in order to carry the structures across the PSN. 
This means that: 
 
1. The amount of TDM data in a CESoPSN packet MUST be either an 
    integer multiple of the basic structure size 
2. The first structure in the packet MUST start immediately at the 
    beginning of the packet payload. 
 
The resulting payload format is shown in Fig. 3 below.

Figure 3. The CESoPSN Packet Payload Format for the Basic NxDS0 Service 
 
This mode of operation complies with the recommendation in [PWE3-ARCH] 
to use similar encapsulations for structured bit stream and cell 
generic payload types.  
 
Packetization latency, number of timeslots and payload size are linked 
by the following obvious relationship: 
 
     L = 8*N*D 
 
where: 
     o  D is packetization latency, milliseconds 
     o  L is packet payload size, octets 
     o  N is number of DS0 channels. 
 
CESoPSN implementations supporting NxDS0 services MUST support the 
following set of configurable packetization latency values:  
 
     o  For N = 1: 8 milliseconds (with the corresponding 
         packet payload size of 64 bytes) 
     o  For 2 <=N <= 4: 4 millisecond (with the corresponding 
         packet payload size of 32*N bytes) 
     o  For N >= 5: 1 millisecond (with the corresponding 
         packet payload size of 8*N octets). 
 
Support of 5 ms packetization latency for N = 1 is RECOMMENDED.

   Structured TDM Circuit Emulation Service over PSN         July 2004 
          
Usage of any other packetization latency (packet payload size) that is 
compatible with the restrictions given in Section 6.2.1 above is 
OPTIONAL. 
 
   5.3. Extending Basic NxDS0 Services with CE Application 
     Signaling 
 
Implementations that have chosen to extend the basic NxDS0 service to 
support CE application state signaling carry encoded CE application 
state signals in separate signaling packets.  
 
Format of the CESoPSN signaling packets over IPv4/IPv6 and MPLS PSN for 
the case when the CE maintains a separate application state per DS0 
channel (e.g., CAS for the telephony applications) is shown in Fig. 4a 
and 4b below respectively.  
 
Signaling packets SHOULD be carried a separate dedicated PW. However, 
implementations MAY carry them in the same PW as the TDM data packets 
for the basic NxDS0 service. The methods of "pairing" the PWs carrying 
TDM data and signaling packets for the same extended NxDS0 service are 
our of scope of this document. 
 
Regardless of the way signaling packets are carried across the PSN, the 
following rules apply: 
 
1. The CESoPSN signaling packets MUST: 
    a) Use their own sequence numbers in the control word 
    b) Set the flags in the control word like following: 
       i)   L = 0 
       ii)  M = '11' 
       iii) R = 0 
2. If RTP header is used in the data packets, it MUST be also used in 
    the signaling packets with the following restrictions: 
    a) An additional RTP payload type (from the range of dynamically 
       allocated types) MUST be allocated for the signaling packets.  
    b) In addition, the signaling packets MUST use their own SSRC 
       value. 
 
The protocol used to assure reliable delivery of signaling packets is 
discussed in Annex A.

   5.4. Trunk-Specific NxDS0 Services with CAS 
 
The structure preserved by CESoPSN for this group of services is the 
trunk multiframe sub-divided into the trunk frames, and signaling 
information is carried appended to the TDM data using the signaling 
 
   Vainshtein et al.           Expires   January 2005         [Page 13]

 
   Structured TDM Circuit Emulation Service over PSN         July 2004 
          
substructures defined in [ATM-CES]. These substructures comprise N 
consecutive nibbles, so that the i-th nibble carries CAS bits for the 
i-th DS0 channel, and are padded with a dummy nibble for odd values of 
N. 
 
CESoPSN implementations supporting trunk-specific NxDS0 services with 
CAS MUST NOT carry more TDM data per packet than is contained in a 
single trunk multiframe. 
 
All CESoPSN implementations supporting trunk-specific NxDS0 with CAS 
MUST support the default mode where a single CESoPSN packet carries 
exactly the amount of TDM data contained in exactly one trunk 
multiframe and appended with the signaling sub-structure. The TDM data 
is aligned with the packet payload. In this case: 
1. Packetization latency is: 
    a) 2 milliseconds for E1 NxDS0  
    b) 3 milliseconds for T1 NxDS0 
2. The packet payload size is: 
    a) 16*n + floor((N+1)/2) for E1-NxDS0 
    b) 24*n + floor((N+1)/2) for T1/ESF-NxDS0 and T1/SF-
       NxDS0 
3. The packet payload format coincides with the multiframe 
    structure described in [ATM-CES] (Section 2.3.1.2). 
    
In order to provide lower packetization latency, CESoPSN 
implementations for trunk-specific NxDS0 with CAS SHOULD support 
fragmentation of multiframe structures between multiple CESoPSN 
packets. In this case: 
 
1. The FRG bits MUST be used to indicate first, intermediate and last 
    fragment of a multiframe as described in [PWE3-FRAG] 
2. The amount of the TDM data per CESoPSN packet must be constant.  
3. Each multiframe fragment MUST comprise an integer multiple of the 
    trunk frames 
4. The signaling substructure MUST be appended to the last fragment of 
    each multiframe. 
 
Format of CESoPSN packets carrying trunk-specific NxDS0 service with 
CAS that do and do not contain signaling substructures is shown in Fig. 
5 (a) and (b) respectively. In these figures the number of the trunk 
frames per multiframe fragment ("m") MUST be an integer divisor of the 
number of frames per trunk multiframe.

Notes:  
1. In case of T1-NxDS0 with CAS, the signaling bits are 
    carried in the TDM data as well as in the signaling 
    substructure. However, the receiver MUST use the CAS bits 
    as carried in the signaling substructures 
2. In case of trunk-specific NxDS0 with CAS originating in a 
    T1-SF trunk, each nibble of the signaling substructure 
    contains A and B bits from two consecutive trunk 
    multiframes as described in [ATM-CES]. 
 
 
6. CESoPSN Operation 
   6.1. Common Considerations 
 
 

   Vainshtein et al.           Expires   January 2005         [Page 15]

 
   Structured TDM Circuit Emulation Service over PSN         July 2004 
          
Edge-to-edge emulation of a TDM service using CESoPSN is only possible 
when the two PW attachment circuits are of the same type (basic NxDS0 
or one of the trunk-specific NxDS0 with CAS) and bit rate. The service 
type and bit rate are exchanged at PW setup as described in [PWE3-
CONTROL]. 
 
   6.2. IWF operation  
 
     6.2.1. PSN-bound Direction 
 
Once the PW is set up, the PSN-bound CESoPSN IWF operates as follows: 
 
TDM data is packetized using the configured number of payload bytes per 
packet. 
  
Sequence numbers, flags, and timestamps (if the RTP header is used) are 
inserted in the CESoPSN headers and, for trunk-specific NxDS0 with CAS, 
signaling substructures are appended to the packets carrying the last 
fragment of a multiframe. 
 
CESoPSN, multiplexing layer and PSN headers are prepended to the 
packetized service data. 
 
The resulting packets are transmitted over the PSN. 
 
     6.2.2. CE-bound Direction 
 
The CE-bound CESoPSN IWF SHOULD include a jitter buffer where payload 
of the received CESoPSN packets is stored prior to play-out to the 
local TDM attachment circuit. The size of this buffer SHOULD be locally 
configurable to allow accommodation to the PSN-specific packet delay 
variation. 
 
The CE-bound CESoPSN IWF SHOULD use the sequence number in the control 
word for detection of lost and mis-ordered packets. If the RTP header 
is used, the RTP sequence numbers MAY be used for the same purposes.  
 
The CE-bound CESoPSN IWF MAY re-order mis-ordered packets. Mis-ordered 
packets that cannot be reordered MUST be discarded and treated as lost. 
 
The payload of the received CESoPSN data packets marked with the L bit 
set SHOULD be replaced by the equivalent amount of some locally 
configured "idle" bit pattern even if it has not been omitted. In 
addition, the CE-bound CESoPSN IWF will be locally configured to 
command its local NSP to perform one of the following actions: 
 
o  None (MUST be supported by all the implementations) 
o  Transmit the AIS pattern towards the local CE on the E1 or T1 trunk 
    carrying the local attachment circuit (support of this action is 
    RECOMMENDED) 
o  Send the "Channel Idle" signal to the local CE for all the DS0 
    channels comprising the local attachment circuit (support of this 
    action is OPTIONAL). 
 
   Vainshtein et al.           Expires   January 2005         [Page 16]

 
   Structured TDM Circuit Emulation Service over PSN         July 2004 
          
 
If the data packets received are marked with L bit cleared and M bits 
set to '10' or with R bit set, the CE-bound CESoPSN IWF will be locally 
configured to command its local NSP to perform one of the following 
actions: 
 
o  None (MUST be supported by all the implementations) 
o  Transmit the RAI pattern towards the local CE on the E1 or T1 trunk 
    carrying the local attachment circuit (support of this action is 
    RECOMMENDED) 
o  Send the "Channel Idle" signal to the local CE for all the DS0 
    channels comprising the local attachment circuit (support of this 
    action is OPTIONAL and requires also that the CE-bound CES IWF 
    replaces the actually received payload with the equivalent amount 
    of the locally configured "idle" bit pattern. 
 
Notes: 
    
1. If the pair of IWFs at the two ends of the PW have been configured 
    to force the TDM trunks carrying their ACs to transmit AIS upon 
    reception of data packets with the L bit set and to transmit RAI 
    upon reception of data packets with the R bit set or with the L bit 
    cleared and M bits set to '10', this PW provides a BW-saving 
    emulation of a fractional E1 or T1 service between the pair of CE 
    devices 
2. If the pair of IWFs at the two ends of the PW have been configured 
    to signal "Channel Idle" CE application state to its local CE upon 
    reception of packets marked with L bit set, R bit set or (L,M) set 
    to '010' and to replace the actually received payload with the 
    locally configured "idle" bit pattern, the resulting PW will comply 
    with the requirements for Downstream Trunk conditioning as defined 
    in [TR-NWT-170]. 
3. Usage of bits R,L and M described above additionally provides the 
    tools for "single-ended" management of the CESoPSN pseudo-wires 
    with ability to distinguish between the problems in the PSN and in 
    the TDM attachment circuits. 
 
The payload of each lost CESoPSN data packet MUST be replaced with the 
equivalent amount of the replacement data. The contents of the 
replacement data are implementation-specific and MAY be locally 
configurable.  By default, all CESoPSN implementations MUST support 
generation of the locally configurable "idle" pattern as the 
replacement data.  
 
Before a PW has been set up and after a PW has been torn down, the IWF 
MUST play out the locally configurable "idle" pattern to its TDM 
attachment circuit. 
 
Once the PW has been set up, the CE-bound IWF begins to receive CESoPSN 
packets and to store their payload in the jitter buffer but continues 
to play out the locally configurable "idle" pattern to its TDM 
attachment circuit. This intermediate state persists until a 
preconfigured amount of TDM data (usually half of the jitter buffer) 
 
   Vainshtein et al.           Expires   January 2005         [Page 17]

 
   Structured TDM Circuit Emulation Service over PSN         July 2004 
          
has been received in consecutive CESoPSN packets or until a 
preconfigured intermediate state timer expires.  
 
Once the preconfigured amount of the TDM data has been received, the 
CE-bound CESoPSN IWF enters its normal operation state where it 
continues to receive CESoPSN packets and to store their payload in the 
jitter buffer while playing out the contents of the jitter buffer in 
accordance with the required clock. In this state the CE-bound IWF 
performs clock recovery, MAY monitor PW defects, and MAY collect PW 
performance monitoring data.  
 
If the CE-bound CESoPSN IWF detects loss of a preconfigured number of 
consecutive packets or if the intermediate state timer expires before 
the required amount of TDM data has been received, it enters its packet 
loss state. While in this state: 
 
o  The locally configurable "idle" pattern SHOULD be played out to the 
    TDM attachment circuit 
o  The local PSN-bound CESoPSN IWF SHOULD mark every packet it 
    transmits with the R bit set.  
      
   The CE-bound CESoPSN IWF leaves this state and transits to the 
   normal one once a preconfigured number of consecutive CESoPSN 
   packets have been received. 
 
   6.3. CESoPSN Defects 
 
In addition to the packet loss state of the CE-bound CESoPSN IWF 
defined above, it MAY detect the following defects: 
 
o  Stray packets 
o  Malformed packets 
o  Excessive packet loss rate 
o  Buffer overrun 
o  Remote packet loss. 
      
Corresponding to each defect is a defect state of the IWF, a detection 
criterion that triggers transition from the normal operation state to 
the appropriate defect state, and an alarm that MAY be reported to the 
management system and thereafter cleared. Alarms are only reported when 
the defect state persists for a preconfigured amount of time (typically 
2.5 seconds) and MUST be cleared after the corresponding defect is 
undetected for a second preconfigured amount of time (typically 10 
seconds). The trigger and release times for the various alarms may be 
independent. 
 
Stray packets MAY be detected by the PSN and multiplexing layers. When 
RTP is used, the SSRC field in the RTP header MAY be used for this 
purpose as well. Stray packets MUST be discarded by the CE-bound IWF 
and their detection MUST NOT affect mechanisms for detection of packet 
loss. 
 
 

   Vainshtein et al.           Expires   January 2005         [Page 18]

 
   Structured TDM Circuit Emulation Service over PSN         July 2004 
          
Malformed packets are detected by mismatch between the expected packet 
size (taking the value of the L bit into account) and the actual packet 
size inferred from the PSN and multiplexing layers. When RTP is used, 
lack of correspondence between the PT value and that allocated for this 
direction of the PW MAY also be used for this purpose. Malformed in-
order packets MUST be discarded by the CE-bound IWF and replacement 
data generated as for lost packets. 
 
Excessive packet loss rate is detected by computing the average packet 
loss rate over a configurable amount of times and comparing it with a 
preconfigured threshold. 
 
Buffer overrun is detected in the normal operation state when the 
jitter buffer of the CE-bound IWF cannot accommodate newly arrived 
CESoPSN packets.  
 
Remote packet loss is indicated by reception of packets with their R 
bit set.  
 
   6.4. CESoPSN PW Performance Monitoring  
 
Performance monitoring (PM) parameters are routinely collected for TDM 
services and provide an important maintenance mechanism in TDM 
networks. Ability to collect compatible PM parameters for CESoPSN PWs 
enhances their maintenance capabilities. 
 
Collection of the CESoPSN PW performance monitoring parameters is 
OPTIONAL, and if implemented, is only performed after the CE-bound IWF 
has exited its intermediate state. 
 
CESoPSN defines error events, errored blocks and defects as follows: 
 
o  A CESoPSN error event is defined as insertion of a single 
    replacement packet into the jitter buffer (replacement of 
    payload of CESoPSN packets with the L bit set is not 
    considered as insertion of a replacement packet) 
o  A CESoPSN errored data block is defined as a block of data 
    played out to the TDM attachment circuit and of size 
    defined in accordance with the [G.826] rules for the 
    corresponding TDM service that has experienced at least one 
    CESoPSN error event  
o  A CESoPSN defect is defined as the packet loss state of the 
    CE-bound CESoPSN IWF. 
  
The CESoPSN PW PM parameters (Errored, Severely Errored and Unavailable 
Seconds) are derived from these definitions in accordance with [G.826].  
 
7. QoS Issues 
 
If the PSN providing connectivity between PE devices is Diffserv-
enabled and provides a PDB [RFC3086] that guarantees low-jitter and 
low-loss, the CESoPSN PW SHOULD use this PDB in compliance with the 
 

   Vainshtein et al.           Expires   January 2005         [Page 19]

 
   Structured TDM Circuit Emulation Service over PSN         July 2004 
          
admission and allocation rules the PSN has put in place for that PDB 
(e.g., marking packets as directed by the PSN). 
 
8. Congestion Control (RFC 2914) Conformance  
 
CESoPSN PWs represent a special case of PWs carrying constant bit rate 
(CBR) services across the PSN. These services, by definition, cannot 
behave in a TCP-friendly manner prescribed by [RFC2914] under 
congestion while retaining any value for the user.  
 
CESoPSN will use the generic PWE3 approach for handling congestion in 
PWs carrying CBR services when such an approach has been specified.  
 
9. Security Considerations 
 
This document does not affect the underlying security issues of 
specific PSN.  
 
In addition, it defines misconnection detection capabilities of 
CESoPSN. These capabilities increase resilience of CESoPSN to 
misconfiguration and some types of DoS attacks. 
 
10. Applicability Statement 
 
CESoPSN is an encapsulation layer intended for carrying circuits NxDS0 
services with or without CAS over PSN.  
 
CESoPSN allows, within reasonable limits, to emulate end-to-end delay 
properties of TDM networks. In particular, in most cases the edge-to-
edge delay introduced by CESoPSN PWs does not depend upon the type and 
bit-rate of the emulated service. 
 
CESoPSN fully complies with the principle of minimal intervention 
minimizing overhead and computational power required for encapsulation.  
 
CESoPSN can be used in conjunction with various clock recovery 
techniques and does not presume availability of a global synchronous 
clock at the ends of a PW. However, if the global synchronous clock is 
available at both ends of a CESoPSN PW, using RTP and differential mode 
of timestamp generation improves the quality of the recovered clock. 
 
CESoPSN allows carrying CE application state signaling that requires 
synchronization with data in-band in separate signaling packets. A 
special combination of flags in the CESoPSN control word is used to 
distinguish between data and signaling packets, while the Timestamp 
field in the RTP headers is used for synchronization. This makes 
CESoPSN extendable to support different types of CE signaling without 
affecting the data path in the PE devices. 
 
CESoPSN also allows emulation of NxDS0 services with CAS carrying the 
signaling information appended to (some of) the packets carrying TDM 
data. 
 
 
   Vainshtein et al.           Expires   January 2005         [Page 20]

 
   Structured TDM Circuit Emulation Service over PSN         July 2004 
          
CESoPSN allows the PSN bandwidth conservation by carrying only AIS 
and/or Idle Code indications instead of data.  
 
CESoPSN allows deployment of BW-saving Fractional point-to-point E1/T1 
applications. These applications can be described like following: 
 
o  The pair of CE devices operates as if they were connected 
    by an emulated E1 or T1 circuit. In particular they react 
    to AIS and RAI states of their local ACs in the standard 
    way 
o  The PSN carries only an NxDS0 service where N is the number 
    of actually used timeslots in the circuit connecting the 
    pair of CE devices thus saving the BW. 
 
Being a constant bit rate (CBR) service, CESoPSN cannot provide TCP-
friendly behavior under network congestion. If the service encounters 
congestion, it should be temporarily shut down. 
 
CESoPSN allows collection of TDM-like faults and performance monitoring 
parameters hence emulating 'classic' carrier services of TDM circuits 
(e.g., SONET/SDH). Similarity with these services is increased by the 
CESoPSN ability to carry 'far end error' indications. 
 
CESoPSN provides for a carrier-independent ability to detect 
misconnections and malformed packets. This feature increases resilience 
of the emulated service to misconfiguration and DoS attacks. 
 
CESoPSN provides for detection of lost packets and allows using various 
techniques for generation of "replacement packets".  
 
CESoPSN carries indications of outages of incoming attachment circuit 
across the PSN thus providing for effective fault isolation. 
 
Faithfulness of a CESoPSN PW may be increased if the carrying PSN is 
Diffserv-enabled and implements a PDB that guarantees low loss and low 
jitter. 
 
CESoPSN does not provide any mechanisms for protection against PSN 
outages. As a consequence, resilience of the emulated service to such 
outages is defined by the PSN behavior. On the other hand: 
 
o  The jitter buffer and packets' reordering mechanisms 
    associated with CESoPSN increase resilience of the emulated 
    service to fast PSN rerouting events 
o  Remote indication of lost packets is carried backward 
    across the PSN from the receiver (that has detected loss of 
    packets) to transmitter. Such an indication MAY be used as 
    a trigger for activation of proprietary service-specific 
    protection mechanisms.

ANNEX A. A COMMON CE APPLICATION STATE SIGNALING MECHANISM 
 
Format of the CESoPSN signaling packets is discussed in 
Section 5.3 above. 
 
The sequence number in the CESoPSN control word for the 
signaling packets is generated according to the same rules as 
for the TDM data packets. 
 
If the RTP header is used in the CESoPSN signaling packets, 
the timestamp in this header represents the time when the CE 
application state has been collected. 
 
Signaling packets are generated by the ingress PE in accordance with 
the following logic (adapted from [RFC2833]): 
 
1. The CESoPSN signaling packet with the same information 
    (including the timestamp in the case RTP header is used) is 
    sent 3 times at an interval of 5 ms under one of the 
    following conditions: 
    a) The CESoPSN PW has been set up 
    b) A change in the CE application state has been 
       detected. If another change of the CE application 
       state has been detected during the 15 ms period, 
       this process continues 
    c) Loss of packets defect has been cleared. These 
       packets SHOULD be marked as "urgent" 
    d) Remote Loss of Packets indication has been cleared 
       (after previously being set)  
2. Otherwise, the CESoPSN signaling packet with the current CE 
    application state information is sent every 5 seconds.

These rules allow fast probabilistic recovery after loss of a single 
signaling packet as well as deterministic (but, possibly, slow) 
recovery following PW setup and PSN outages. 
 
Encoding of CE application state for telephony applications using CAS 
follows [RFC2833]. 
 
Encoding of CE application state for telephony application using CCS 
will be considered in a separate document. 
 
ANNEX B. REFERENCE PE ARCHITECTURE FOR EMULATION OF NXDS0 SERVICES 
 
Structured TDM services do not exist as physical circuits. They are 
always carried within appropriate physical attachment circuits (AC), 
and the PE providing their emulation always includes a Native 
Processing Block (NSP) commonly referred to as Framer. As a 
consequence, the architecture of a PE device providing edge-to-edge 
emulation for these services includes the Framer and Forwarder blocks. 
 
In case of NxDS0 services (the only type of structured services 
considered in this document), the AC is either an E1 or a T1 trunk, and 
bundles of NxDS0 are cut out of it using one of the framing methods 
described in [G.704]. 
 
In addition to detecting the FAS and imposing associated structure on 
the "trunk" AC, E1 and T1 framers commonly support some additional 
functionality including: 
 
     1. Detection of special states of the incoming AC (e.g., 
         AIS, OOF or RAI) 
     2. Forcing special states (e.g., AIS and RAI) on the 
         outgoing AC upon an explicit request 
     3. Extraction and insertion of CE application signals 
         that may accompany specific DS0 channel(s).  
 
The resulting PE architecture for NxDS0 services is shown in Fig. B.1 
below. In this diagram: 
 
     1. In the PSN-bound direction: 
         a) The Framer: 
            i)   Detects frame alignment signal (FAS) 
               and splits the incoming ACs into separate 
               DS0 channels 
            ii)  Detects special AC states 
            iii) If necessary, extracts CE application 
               signals accompanying each of the separate 
               DS0 services 
         b) The Forwarder: 
            i)   Creates one or more NxDS0 bundles 
            ii)  Sends the data received in each such 
               bundle to the PSN-bound direction of a 
               respective CESoPSN IWF instance

   Structured TDM Circuit Emulation Service over PSN         July 2004 
          
            iii) If necessary, sends the current CE 
               application state data of the DS0 
               services in the bundle to the PSN-bound 
               direction of the respective CESoPSN IWF 
               instance 
            iv)  If necessary sends the AC state 
               indications to the PSN-bound directions 
               of all the CESoPSN instances associated 
               with the given AC 
         c) Each PSN-bound PW IWF instance encapsulates the 
            received data, application state signal and the 
            AC state into PW PDUs and sends the resulting 
            packets to the PSN 
     2. In the CE-bound direction: 
            i)   Each CE-bound instance of the CESoPSN 
               IWF receives the PW PDUs from the PSN, 
               extracts the TDM data, AC state and CE 
               application state signals and sends them  
         b) The Forwarder sends the TDM data, application 
            state signals and, if necessary, a single 
            command representing the desired AC state, to 
            the Framer 
         c) The Framer accepts all the data of one or more 
            NxDS0 bundles possibly accompanied by the 
            associated CE application state and commands 
            referring to the desired AC state, and 
            generates a single AC accordingly with correct 
            FAS. 
 
Notes: This model is asymmetric:  
     o  AC state indication can be forwarded from the framer 
         to multiple instances of the CESoPSN IWF 
     o  No more than one CESoPSN IWF instance should forward 
         AC state-affecting commands to the framer.
