Abstract

   VCards need a stable, well defined list of timezone names, so that
   users can create VCards that refer to timezones.  There is no common
   list of such names, and other standards need timezone names also.
   This document creates an IANA registry of timezone names, and
   initially populates the list.

Initial version

   o  Define timezone registry.

   o  Defer initial population with Olsen database until we like the

Internet-Draft      Timezone Name Registry Definition         March 2009


1.  Introduction

   VCards need a stable, well defined list of timezone names, so that
   users can create VCards that refer to timezones.  There is no common
   list of such names, and other standards need timezone names also.
   This document creates an IANA registry of timezone names, and
   initially populates the list.

   This document defines only the names, leaving the definition of the
   timezone rules ("normal offset is UTC+2", "switch to summer time on
   the third Sunday in March", etc) out of scope.  The registry contains
   an optional URI for each defined timezone, and it's possible for that
   URI to point to a place where such rule definitions can be obtained.

   A timezone name has the following ABNF [ABNF] syntax:

   tzname = ALPHA *127(ALPHA / DIGIT)
            ; may have mixed case for readability
            ; interpreted case-insensitively


2.  IANA Considerations

2.1.  New registry for timezone names

   IANA is asked to create a new registry for timezone names.  This
   registry contains only IETF-controlled timezone names.  New names are
   registered using the "Specification Required" policy [IANA].
   [[It won't be "Specification Required".  What should it be?]]

   This defines the template for a new registry for timezone names, to
   be created as http://www.iana.org/assignments/timezone-names.  There
   are no initial entries for this registry.

   To: iana@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of new timezone name
   Timezone name: [a short US-ASCII string with no internal meaning]
   Description: [a human-readable US-ASCII string, in English, that
   describes the meaning of this timezone (such as, "the time zone in
   New York City")]
   Information URI: [A URI that points to more information about this
   timezone.  Specify "none" if there is no appropriate URI.]

2.2.  Initial population of timezone-names registry

   The following are the initial names to be registered in the timezone-
   names registry, to be entered in
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/timezone-names.

   [[anchor1: We'll be filling this in from the Olsen DB...]]

   Timezone name: ??
   Description: a time zone.
   Information URI: none


3.  Security Considerations

   This document defines an IANA registry.  There are no security
   considerations.
