Internet-Draft          Emergency req.s in Japan                May 2005


1.  Introduction

   Public IP telephony services in Japan became popular by the
   allocation of the exclusive IP phone number begun in September 2002.
   The IP telephone number is an eleven-digit telephone number includes
   "050" prefix followed by the carrier ID.  Currently more than seven
   million users subscribe the IP telephony service, and further
   subscription is expected in the next few years.

1.1  IP telephony services in Japan

   There are two types of public IP telephony services in Japan.  One is
   the '050' service mentioned above, and another is the IP telephony
   service using standard telephone number of '0AB-J'.  The ministerial
   ordinance requires service providers to achieve a certain level of
   required condition.

   The requirements to the '0AB-J' IP telephony service are summarized
   below.

   o  Provides voice quality equal to PSTN telephone

   o  Enables the use of the emergency calls

   o  Installed location of the IP telephone device is fixed and the
      devices are not portable

   On the other hand, the IP telephony services with 050 prefix are not
   necessarily bound by these conditions.

   There is a general opinion that it is preferable for the emergency
   calls to be enabled both on 050 IP telephony services or on 0AB-J IP
   telephony services as long as the users consider these services are
   alternatives to PSTN telephone.

1.2  Committee for the Advancement of Emergency Message Systems (CAEMS)

   In November 2003, the Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications
   requested the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC)
   for the advice about the achievement of the emergency call with the
   IP telephony services prompt and emphatically.

   Upon this request, MIC set up the IP Telephony Working Group under
   the Committee for the Advancement of Emergency Message Systems
   (CAEMS) from March 2004 to January 2005 to discuss the requirements
   to the emergency call securing in the IP network.  The study group
   was composed of the emergency call acceptance organization (ECAO in
   this document), the people from academic background, the

Internet-Draft          Emergency req.s in Japan                May 2005


   telecommunications carrier, the IP telephony equipment manufacturer,
   and so forth.

   As the result of study, a draft proposal that consists of the
   authority's service requirements and the functional requirements was
   compiled and the draft is currently under public review [MIC draft
   report].  The document in Japanese is available from MIC home page.
   At the end of March 2005, the final report that incorporates the
   public comments will be submitted to the minister of MIC.

   The purpose of this report is for parties concerned of the
   telecommunications carrier, the emergency call acceptance
   organization, the IP telephone terminal maker, and so forth, to fix a
   detailed specification, to advance the introduction, and to use it
   widely.

   This memo provides information on the requirements for the emergency
   call acceptance on the IP network, based on the above-mentioned draft
   proposal under the public review.

1.3  A assumed network model

   The following preconditions were assumed for the CAEMS discussion.

   IP Telephony Network:

      There will be two types of network configuration

      ECAO is connected to IP network via PSTN using existing emergency
      line

      ECAO is connected directly to IP telephony network via a new IP
      line

   Types of IP telephony services:

      Fixed IP telephone

      Portable IP telephone

      IP telephone with mobile capability

2.  Emergency numbers in Japan

   There are three emergency telephone numbers in Japan.  It is 110
   (police), 118 (Japan Coast Guard), and 119(fire station and
   ambulance).

   When dialing one of these numbers, the emergency call is established
   toward the emergency reception desk of each organization that covers
   the area where the reporter is present.  In PSTN, telephony carriers
   have a database with subscriber's name, address, and telephone
   number, and each emergency telephone number is converted to the
   telephone number of emergency reception desk of each ECAO.

   Each ECAO places an emergency call reception desk based on the
   district of their definition.

   Police (110): 52 head offices

      1 in each 47 prefectures, except 2 in Tokyo and 5 in Hokkaido

   Japan Coast Guard (118): 11 jurisdictions

   Fire station and ambulance (119): Slightly less than 900 districts

      Defined locally along with the district of about 3000
      municipalities

3.  IP Telephony Requirements for Emergency Messages

   This section provides a list of highly important requirements in
   support of the emergency messages within the context of IP telephony
   in Japan.

   MUST1:   Emergency call MUST be got to the correct Emergency Call
            Reception Office (ECRO), which covers where the reporter is
            present.

   MUST2:   Emergency call MUST be redirected to an alternative facility
            that the organization designates as an alternative reception
            office, in case the original ECRO could not do its duty due
            to a disaster etc.

   MUST3:   Information for identifying the operator who can provide the
            reporter's subscription information MUST be presented to
            ECRO.

   MUST4:   Emergency call MUST NOT be terminated unless ECRO terminated
            it, even though the reporter hung up.  (Keeping connection)

   MUST5:   Reporter's terminal MUST be rung up from ECRO if ECRO inteds
            to resume the conversation with the reporter during "keeping
            connection" would be activated.  (Reversing call)

   MUST6:   Reporter's caller-ID MUST be presented to ECRO unless the
            reporter dials the restriction code followed with "11x"
            (110, 118 or 119).

   MUST7:   ECRO MUST be allowed to acquire the caller-ID even though
            the reporter dialed with the restriction code.

   MUST8:   Geographical Location Information (GLI) that the reporter is
            present MUST be presented to ECRO.

   MUST9:   GLI MUST consist of

            *  Fixed IP-phone: subscriber's name, address, address code
               and telephone number

            *  Portable/Mobile IP-phone: subscriber's name, place of
               dispatch information, telephone number, and mobile-use or
               not

Internet-Draft          Emergency req.s in Japan                May 2005


   MUST10:  Emergency call MUST have priority over all other calls in
            any case.

   MUST11:  Operator MUST prevent a malicious call pretending the place
            of dispatch.


3.1  Getting Emergency Call to Correct Emergency Call Reception Office

   As mentioned in section 2, the emergency call that will be dialed
   110, 118 and 119 must be got to the correct emergency call reception
   office (ECRO), which takes charge of place where the call would be
   sent, by location-based call routing.  This requirement must be met
   IP telephony emergency call service, in case of not only fixed-use IP
   telephones, but also portable IP telephones for fixed-use and mobile
   IP telephones.

   In this case, call control nodes should identify emergency calls in
   order to establish a call even under network congestion.  Some
   networks use alternative telephone number other than emergency number
   of 110/118/119 for routing purpose, and therefore the emergency calls
   should be identified by an identifier other than dialed number.

3.2  Keeping Connection

   This requirement is for allowing the ECRO to secure the time or the
   chance of the conversation with the reporter if necessary.

   IP telecommunication providers are required to provide the "keeping
   connection" functionality that keeps the call unless the ECRO would
   terminate the call, even though the reporter would hang up.  And the
   providers are also required to provide the "reversing call"
   functionality that rings the reporter's terminal up by operating the
   instruction board in the ECRO, if the ECRO intends to resume the
   conversation with the reporter while the emergency call is kept by
   the "keeping connection" functionality.

   For instance, it should be achieved by implementing either of th e
   following functionalities:

      The connection between the reporter and the ECRO, which received
      the emergency call from the reporter, is established regardless of
      the reporter's intention even if the reporter lifts the receiver
      trying to call somewhere after the reporter hung up the emergency
      call.

      The reporter's present call is terminated or suspended and then
      another new call between the reporter and the ECRO is established

Internet-Draft          Emergency req.s in Japan                May 2005


      even if the ECRO calls the reporter up while the reporter is
      talking over a new call after the reporter hung up the emergency
      call.


3.3  Presenting and Acquiring Calling Line Identification, and
     Presenting IP Telecommunication Provider Identification

   These functionalities, Calling Line Identification Presentation and
   Acquisition, and IP Telecommunication Provider Identification
   Presentation, are used for calling the reporter back from the ECRO
   that received the emergency call, if the ECRO intends to resume the
   conversation with the reporter after the call ends.

   In general, IP telecommunication providers in Japan provide Calling
   Line Identification Presentation and Restriction (CLIP and CLIR)
   service; the selection of whether the identification is presented is
   either by the subscription contract or by specifying the service
   number (which is 184 or 186) before the telephone number you would
   dial.  The latter has precedence over the former.  That is, if you
   specify the service number for CLIR before the telephone number you
   dial, the reporter's telephone number won't be displayed on the
   called site even though the reporter subscribes as CLIP.  On the
   other hand, if you specify CLIP, the reporter's telephone number will
   be displayed even though the reporter subscribes as CLIR.

   For the emergency call, the reporter's telephone number must be
   presented to the ECRO regardless of the subscription of the reporter,
   unless the reporter specifies CLIR explicitly.

   Furthermore, even if the reporter specifies CLIR, the ECRO must be
   able to acquire the reporter's telephone number over the call or the
   "keeping connection" condition.  Because, for example, in case the
   reporter faces a crisis that is a matter of life and death, even if
   the reporter doesn't want to present his/her telephone number to the
   ECRO, the ECRO has to know the reporter's telephone number in order
   to settle the circumstance.  This operation conforms to "The
   Guidelines on the Protection of Personal Information in the
   Telecommunications Business" (MIC Announcement No. 695 of 2004).

   Also it is necessary for the ECRO to identify per call the IP
   telecommunication provider to which the reporter subscribes.  This
   functionality allows the ECRO that receives the emergency call to
   inquire subscriber information for the IP telecommunication provider
   even if the ECRO couldn't acquire reporter's information on the
   telephone number or the geographical location etc.

3.4  Presenting and Acquiring Geographical Location Information

   Geographical location information of the reporter must be presented
   to the ECRO that receives the call when the ECRO receives the call
   and the ECRO demands information from the IP telecommunication
   provider.

   To consider applying the existing geographical location information
   system, there are two configurations; one is that two connections are
   used for voice and the geographical location system individually, and
   the other provides one connection for them.

   HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is used for transferring
   Geographical location information that is formatted by XML
   (eXtensible Markup Language).

   The content of the location information must be accurate so that the
   fire department, the police department etc. may deal with the problem
   promptly.

   The following shows the contents of the location information.

Appendix A.2  Municipality code

   This follows the Prefecture code and consists of 3-digit in the
   decimal system.  This code shows a special-ward, a ward in an
   government-designated major city, a city, or a town or a village in a
   district.  The following URL shows the division.  There are 23
   special-wards (in Tokyo), 726 cities, 1559 towns and 400 villages as
   of 14 Mar. 2005.

      black lines: the boundaries of each municipality

      red lines: the boundaries of each prefecture

      blue lines: coastlines, or the boundaries of an area of a river or
         a lake

   This code is defined by [JIS X 0402].

Appendix A.2.1  Prefecture

   000 is used for a prefecture.  For example, Hokkaido is 01000.

Appendix A.2.2  Government-designated major cities and wards

   A government-designated major city is a city of 500000 or more,
   granted special rights by government ordinance.

   The code for a government-designated major city is used the number
   starting from 100 every 30 in order that the ordinance-designated
   city is enforced in a prefecture, e.g. 100, 130, 160.  And each ward
   in the cities is sequentially numbered from 101, 131, 161.

   For example, in case of Yokohama City and Kawasaki City that are
   goverment-designated major cities in Kanagawa prefecture (which
   prefecture code is 14);

      Yokohama City: 14100

         Tsurumi Ward: 14101

         Kanagawa Ward: 14102

         ...

      Kawasaki City: 14130

         Kawasaki Ward: 14131

         Saiwai Ward: 14132

         ...


Appendix A.2.3  Special-wards in Tokyo

   100 is assigned for "Special-ward" as well as the government-
   designated major city.  And each ward in Tokyo (which prefecture code
   is 13) is sequentially numbered from 101.

   For example;

      Special-ward: 13100

      Chiyoda ward: 13101

      Chuo ward: 13102

      ...


Appendix A.2.4  Cities

   Each city excepting Government-designated major cities is
   sequentially numbered from 201.  Usually the number is assigned in
   order of the municipal organization enforcement.

   For example, in case of Tokyo prefecture;

      Hachioji City: 13201

      Tachikawa City: 13202

      Musashino City: 13203

      ...


Appendix A.2.5  Towns and Villages

   The number from 301 is assigned for each town and village.  The town
   and village is made a group in each district, and the number of every
   20 is given sequentially as 301, 321, 341.

   For example, in case of Higashi-Tsugaru District and Nishi-Tsugaru
   District of Aomori prefecture (which code is 02);

      Higashi-Tsugaru District

         Hiranai Town: 02301

         Kanita Town: 02302

         Imabetsu Town: 02303

         ...

      Nishi-Tsugaru District

         Ajigasawa Town: 02321

         Fukaura Town: 02323

Internet-Draft          Emergency req.s in Japan                May 2005


         Iwasaki Village: 02325

         ...

         Note that 02322, 02324 are missing number due to municipal
         mergers.

   Exceptionally, Shimajiri District of Okinawa Prefecture is assigned
   between 341 and 369, and Miyako District is assigned between 371 and
   379, because Shimajiri District consisted of more than 20 towns and
   villages.

   In the case of Hokkaido, each branch administrative office is made a
   group, and the number is given at intervals of 30 such as 301, 331,
   361.  And also in the case of solitary islands of Tokyo prefecture
   and Tsushima islands of Nagasaki prefecture, each branch
   administrative office is made a group, and the number following the
   mainland is given at intervals of 20.


Appendix A.3  Section code and Subsection code

   Section code and Subsection code are defined by two public
   corporations under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal
   Affairs and Communications, which are LASDEC (Local Authorities
   Systems Development Center, http://www.lasdec.nippon-net.ne.jp/) and
   JGDC (Japan Geographic Data Center, http://www.kokudo.or.jp/).  These
   are used for representing official address names and popular names.
   As popular names, there are the name of an architecture, the number
   of floor and so on.

| 13104112102 | Tokyo      | Shinjuku     | Island-Towe  | 2nd floor  |
+-------------+------------+--------------+--------------+------------+

               Table 3: Example: address code of a building

   13 is the code of Tokyo prefecture, 104 is Shinjuku Ward, 112 is
   Island-Tower building.  And the number of floor is a kind of puplar
   names, so 101 and 102 are assigned.

   And Island-Tower is in Nishi-Shinjuku, Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo
