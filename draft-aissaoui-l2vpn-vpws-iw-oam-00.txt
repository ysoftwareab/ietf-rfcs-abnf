   2      Introduction 
      
     This draft proposes OAM procedures for the Virtual Private 
     Wire Service (VPWS). VPWS are defined in the L2 VPN framework 
     [L2VPN-FRMK]. 
      
     The following VPWS types are covered in this document: 
      
     1. VPWS with homogeneous attachment circuits (ACs) of ATM, FR, or 
        Ethernet types.

  Internet Draft draft-aissaoui-l2vpn-vpws-iw-oam-00.txt  February 2004 
   
     2. VPWS with heterogeneous ACs of ATM and FR types, and in which 
        the PW type is ATM or FR. In this case, FR-ATM service 
        interworking [FRF8.1] is performed in PE1 (or PE2) and a FR (or 
        ATM) PW is extended to the remote PE. This VPWS type will be 
        referred to as ôFR-ATM Interworking VPWSö. 
   
     3. VPWS with heterogeneous ACs of ATM, FR, and Ethernet types, and 
        in which the PW type is Ethernet [L2VPN-Interworking]. This 
        VPWS type will be referred to as ôEthernet Interworking VPWSö. 
   
     4. VPWS with heterogeneous ACs of ATM, FR, and Ethernet types, and 
        in which the PW type is IP [ARP-Mediation]. This VPWS type will 
        be referred to as ôIP Interworking VPWSö. 
      
     The following topics are not covered and may be addressed in a 
     future revision of this document:  
      
     1.   ATM ILMI Interworking 
      
     2.   Handling of Loopback and CC OAM cells for ATM [I.610]. 
      
     3.   The use of an inband PW method to notify the remote PE of the 
     status of the PW. 
       
   3      General OAM Procedures

     (a)  Defect in the first L2 network (L2N1). This covers any defect 
          in the L2N1 which impacts all or a subset of ACs terminating 
          in PE1. The defect is conveyed to PE1 and to the remote L2 
          network (L2N2) using a L2 specific OAM defect indication.  
     (b)  Defect on a PE1 AC interface. 
     (c)  Defect on a PE PSN interface. 
     (d)  Defect in the PSN network. This covers any defect in the PSN 
          which impacts all or a subset of the PSN tunnels and PWs 
          terminating in a PE. The defect is conveyed to the PE using a 
          PSN and/or a PW specific OAM defect indication. 
     (e)  Defect in the second L2 network (L2N2). This covers any 
          defect in L2N2 which impacts all or a subset of ACs 
          terminating in PE2. The defect is conveyed to PE2 and to the 
          remote L2 network (L2N1) using a L2 specific OAM defect 
          indication. 
     (f)  Defect on a PE2 AC interface. 

   3.2        VPWS OAM Interworking Models 
      
     There are two different OAM interworking models which are dictated 
     by the type of VPWS.  
      
     In a homogeneous VPWS, the link layer of the AC is not terminated 
     at a PE. This has the implication that the native service OAM has 
     to operate transparently across the PSN. In this case, the default 
     OAM procedures are to use the native service OAM for both the AC 
     and PW defect indications. This model is referred to as the 
     homogeneous VPWS OAM model. An example of this is ATM VPWS OAM 
     procedures as specified in [PWE3-ATM]. However, it is acknowledged 
     that some PE implementations may not be capable of generating 
     and/or passing native service OAM messages over a PW. For those 
     situations, an optional procedure based on terminating the native 
     service OAM and conveying the corresponding status using out-of-
     band PW status signaling messages [PWE3-CONTROL] is proposed. This 
     method is also proposed for the FR VPWS and the Ethernet VPWS for 
     different reasons. Frame Relay link management protocol is widely 
     used on FR UNI links but there is no known deployment of FR OAM 
     standard [FRF.19]. Finally, Ethernet link management and OAM 
     standards are at their early development stage.  
      
     In a heterogeneous VPWS, the AC link layer is terminated at a PE. 
     Therefore, the native service OAM always terminates at the AC 
     endpoint in the PE. In this case, the default OAM procedures are 
     to terminate the native service OAM and to convey the 
     corresponding status using out-of-band PW status signaling 
     messages. This model is referred to as the heterogeneous VPWS OAM 
     model. As always, there is an exception to this. The FR-ATM 
     interworking VPWS can be achieved by extending a ATM PW, instead 
     of a FR PW, to the remote PE. Therefore, one can use the 
     homogeneous VPWS OAM model and rely on the native ATM OAM inband.

   3.3        PW Status 
      
     A PW is declared DOWN if any of the following conditions are met: 
     (i)    A physical layer alarm is detected on the PSN interface. 
      
     (ii)   The status of the PSN tunnel over which the PW is riding 
             is DOWN. In the case of a MPLS PSN, this status can be the 
             result of running a MPLS specific OAM mechanism such as 
             LSP-Ping [LSP-Ping] or Y.1711 CV [Y.1711]. This can also 
             be the result of receiving a Y.1711 FDI/BDI in a MPLS 
             tunnel. Finally, this status can be the result of a PE 
             receiving a RSVP-TE PathErr message. 
   
     (iii)  A remote PW status message [PWE3-CONTROL] is received 
             indicating that one or both directions of the PW are down. 
   
     (iv)   An inband PW OAM connectivity verification, such as VCCV 
             [VCCV] or Y.1711 CV, or the receipt of a Y.1711 FDI/BDI 
             indicates that one or both directions of the PW are down. 
   
     Note that a PW is a bidirectional entity. A defect in one of the 
     directions is treated as a defect in the entire PW. 

   3.4        ATM AC Status 
      
     An ATM AC is declared DOWN if any of the following conditions are 
     met: 
     (i)    A physical layer alarm is detected on the ATM interface. 
     (ii)   PE2 receives an F4/F5 AIS/RDI OAM cell indicating that the 
             ATM VP/VC is down in the L2N2 ATM network. 

   3.5        FR AC Status 
      
     A FR AC is declared DOWN if any of the following conditions are 
     met: 
     (i)    A PVC is not ædeletedÆ from the Frame Relay network and 
             the Frame Relay network explicitly indicates in a full 
             status report (and optionally by the asynchronous status 
             message) that this Frame Relay PVC is æinactiveÆ. In this 
             case, this status maps across the PE to the corresponding 
             PW only. 
     (ii)   The LIV indicates that the link from the PE1 to the Frame 
             Relay network is down. In this case, the link down 
             indication maps across the PE to all corresponding PWs. 
     (iii)  A physical layer alarm is detected on the FR interface. In 
             this case, this status maps across the PE to all 
             corresponding PWs. 

   3.6        Ethernet AC Status

     An Ethernet AC is declared DOWN if any of the following conditions 
     are met: 
     (i)    A physical layer alarm is detected on the Ethernet 
             interface. 
      
   4      OAM Procedures for VPWS with homogeneous ACs 
      
     Note: it has been pointed out at time of publication that Section 
     4 of this document and revision 4 of draft-nadeau-pwe3-oam-msg-map 
     [OAM-MSG] converged on many aspects. It is the intent of the 
     authors of the two drafts to fully align these sections and move 
     the result into the next revision of draft-nadeau-pwe3-oam-msg-
     map. 

   4.1        ATM VPWS 
     
     The ATM VPWS is based on the PWE3 ATM PW specification [PWE3-ATM]. 
     ATM provides a complete set of OAM capabilities which include 
     defect indication (AIS/RDI), continuity checking (CC), loopback 
     verification (LB), and performance monitoring [I.610].  
      
     In normal, i.e., defect-free, operation, all the above types of 
     ATM OAM cells are either terminated at the PE, for OAM segments 
     terminating in the AC endpoint, or transparently carried over the 
     PSN tunnel [PWE3-ATM]. In other words, the ATM VPWS makes use of 
     the homogeneous VPWS OAM model. 
      
     Defects in locations (a) or (b) should be conveyed to the remote 
     ATM network L2N2 [PWE3-ATM]. In this case, PE1 should 
     transparently carry the AIS/RDI cells received on the 
     corresponding AC (defect a) or generated locally (defect b) over 
     the corresponding ATM PW. 
      
     Optionally, if PE1 cannot generate and/or transmit ATM OAM cells 
     over the ATM PW, it may use the heterogeneous OAM model. PE1 
     should change the status of the corresponding ATM ACs to DOWN and 
     generate PW status signaling messages [PWE3-CONTROL] to notify PE2 
     of the defect. PE2 will in turn generate AIS messages on the 
     corresponding ACs towards L2N2. 
   
     Defects in locations (c) or (d) will result in changing the status 
     of the PSN tunnel and the corresponding PWs (both directions) to 
     DOWN in PE1. Note that PE1 will only know that the transmit 
     direction of the PSN tunnel is down. The receive direction for 
     that same PSN tunnel can terminate on any other PSN interface and 
     its status at PE1 is unknown. PE1 should generate AIS on the 
     affected ACs to convey this status to L2N1 [PWE3-ATM]. Given that 
     the transmit direction of the PSN tunnel is down, PE1 cannot use 
     an ATM AIS inband to notify PE2 and L2N2. Therefore, an out-of-
     band notification may be used here. PE1 may generate PW status 
     signaling messages to notify PE2 of the defect. Also, in the case 
     of a MPLS PSN, PE2 may be able to detect the defect on its own by

  Internet Draft draft-aissaoui-l2vpn-vpws-iw-oam-00.txt  February 2004 
   
     running LSP-Ping [LSP-Ping] or Y.1711 CV [Y.1711] over the tunnel 
     LSP. Also, PE2 may receive a RSVP-TE PathErr message if the other 
     direction of the PSN tunnel has failed. In any case, PE2 should in 
     turn generate AIS messages on the corresponding ACs towards L2N2. 
   
     The handling of a defect in locations (e) and (f) is similar to 
     that of locations (a) and (b) respectively. 

   4.2        FR VPWS 
      
     The FR VPWS is based on the PWE3 FR PW specification [PWE3-FR]. 
     Frame relay networks make use of PVC management over a FR UNI. 
     This is based on Q.933 Annex A. A more extensive FR OAM capability 
     set has subsequently been specified by the FR Forum [FRF.19] but 
     this has little known deployments. Based on that, it is proposed 
     to use the heterogeneous VPWS OAM model. 
      
     In order to provide end-to-end defect notification in a FR VPWS, 
     the following procedures should be followed. 
      
     Defects in locations (a) or (b) will result in changing the status 
     of the corresponding FR ACs to DOWN in PE1. In this case, PE1 
     should generate a PW status message on each of the corresponding 
     FR PWs to convey this status to the remote PE (PE2). PE2 should in 
     turn generate a full status report with the Active bit = 0 (and 
     optionally in the asynchronous status message), as per Q.933 annex 
     A, into L2N2 for the corresponding FR ACs. 
       
     A FR AC is declared DOWN if any of the conditions described in 
     Section 3.5 are met. 
      
     Defects in locations (c) or (d) will result in changing the status 
     of the corresponding PWs (both directions) to DOWN in PE1. In this 
     case, PE1 should translate this status by sending Active bit = 0 
     in the full status report (and optionally in the asynchronous 
     status message), as per Q.933 annex A, into L2N1 and for the 
     corresponding FR ACs. In addition, PE1 should send a PW status 
     signaling message to the remote PE to convey the status of the 
     affected PWs. PE2 should in turn generate a full status report 
     with the Active bit = 0 (and optionally in the asynchronous status 
     message), as per Q.933 annex A, into L2N2 for the corresponding FR 
     ACs. 
      
     A PW is declared DOWN if any of the conditions described in 
     Section 3.3 are met. 
      
     The handling of a defect in locations (e) and (f) is similar to 
     that of locations (a) and (b) respectively.

     The Ethernet VPWS is based on the PWE3 Ethernet PW specification 
     [PWE3-ETH]. Ethernet link layer management and service OAM 
     standards are at their early development stage. Therefore, the 
     determination of Ethernet AC status is based on the status of the 
     physical interface. In addition, Ethernet AC status change can 
     only be conveyed to a management system. Based on that, it is 
     proposed to use the heterogeneous VPWS OAM model. 
      
     In order to provide end-to-end defect notification in an Ethernet 
     VPWS, the following procedures should be followed. 
      
     Defects in locations (a) or (b) will result in changing the status 
     of the corresponding Ethernet ACs to DOWN in PE1. In this case, 
     PE1 should generate a PW status message on each of the 
     corresponding Ethernet PWs to convey this status to the remote PE 
     (PE2). PE2 should in turn change the status of the corresponding 
     Ethernet ACs to DOWN. 
       
     An Ethernet AC is declared DOWN if any of the conditions described 
     in Section 3.6 are met. 
      
     Defects in locations (c) or (d) will result in changing the status 
     of the corresponding PWs (both directions) to DOWN in PE1. In this 
     case, PE1 should translate this status by changing the status of 
     the corresponding Ethernet ACs to DOWN. In addition, PE1 should 
     send a PW status signaling message to the remote PE to convey the 
     status of the affected PWs. PE2 should in turn change the status 
     of the corresponding Ethernet ACs to DOWN. 
      
     A PW is declared DOWN if any of the conditions described in 
     Section 3.3 are met. 
      
     The handling of a defect in locations (e) and (f) is similar to 
     that of locations (a) and (b) respectively. 
      
   5      OAM Procedures for VPWS with heterogeneous ACs 

   5.1        FR-ATM Interworking VPWS 
      
     The FR-ATM interworking VPWS consists of interworking FR and ATM 
     ACs over the PSN. Frame relay networks make use of PVC management 
     over a FR UNI. This is based on Q.933 Annex A. ATM networks make 
     use of the ATM OAM capabilities as specified in [I.610].  

   5.1.1         Heterogeneous VPWS OAM Model 
   
     In order to provide end-to-end defect notification in a FR-ATM 
     interworking VPWS, the following procedures should be followed. 
     For clarity of the text, it is assumed that the ACs attached to 
     PE1 in Figure 2 are of FR type. Similarly, it is assumed that the 
     ACs attached to PE2 are of ATM type. The PW type is ATM if the

     FRF.8.1 [FRF.8.1] interworking function resides in PE1. The PW 
     type is FR if it resides in PE2. 
      
     Defects in locations (a) or (b) will result in changing the status 
     of the corresponding FR ACs to DOWN in PE1. In this case, PE1 
     should generate a PW status message on each of the corresponding 
     FR PWs to convey this status to the remote PE (PE2). PE2 should in 
     turn translate this status into an ATM AIS message to be sent in 
     each of the corresponding ATM ACs. 
       
     A FR AC is declared DOWN if any of the conditions described in 
     Section 3.5 are met. 
      
     Defects in locations (c) or (d) will result in changing the status 
     of the corresponding PWs (both directions) to DOWN in PE1. In this 
     case, PE1 should translate this status by sending Active bit = 0 
     in the full status report (and optionally in the asynchronous 
     status message), as per Q.933 annex A, into the local Frame Relay 
     network and for the corresponding FR ACs. In addition, PE1 should 
     send a PW status signaling message to the remote PE to convey the 
     status of the affected PWs. PE2 should in turn translate this 
     status into an ATM AIS message to be sent in each of the 
     corresponding ATM ACs. 
      
     A PW is declared DOWN if any of the conditions described in 
     Section 3.3 are met. 
      
     Defects in location (e) or (f) will result in changing the status 
     of the corresponding ATM ACs to DOWN in PE2. In this case, PE2 
     should generate a PW status message on each of the corresponding 
     PWs to convey this status to PE1. PE1 should in turn translate 
     this status by sending Active bit = 0 in the full status report 
     (and optionally in the asynchronous status message), as per Q.933 
     annex A, into the local Frame Relay network and for the 
     corresponding FR ACs. 
      
     An ATM AC is declared DOWN if any of the conditions described in 
     Section 3.4 are met. 

   5.1.2          Homogeneous VPWS OAM Model 
      
     When the PW type is ATM, the homogeneous VPWS OAM procedures may 
     be used instead. These are described in Section 4.1 for a ATM 
     VPWS. 

   5.2        Ethernet Interworking VPWS 
       
     The Ethernet interworking VPWS consists of interworking FR, ATM, 
     and Ethernet ACs over the PSN when the PW is of Ethernet type only 
     [L2VPN-IW]. The heterogeneous VPWS OAM model is used here.

     In order to provide end-to-end defect notification in a Ethernet 
     interworking VPWS, the following procedures should be followed. 
     For clarity of the text, it is assumed that the ACs attached to 
     PE1 in Figure 2 are of FR type. It is also assumed that the ACs 
     attached to PE2 are either of ATM type or of a Ethernet type. 
      
     Defects in locations (a) or (b) will result in changing the status 
     of the corresponding FR ACs to DOWN in PE1. In this case, PE1 
     should generate a PW status message on each of the corresponding 
     PWs to convey this status to the remote PE (PE2). PE2 should in 
     turn translate this status into an ATM AIS message to be sent in 
     each of the corresponding ATM ACs. Also, PE2 should change the 
     status of the corresponding Ethernet ACs to DOWN. 
       
     A FR AC is declared DOWN if any of the conditions described in 
     Section 3.5 are met. 
      
     Defects in locations (c) or (d) will result in changing the status 
     of the corresponding PWs (both directions) to DOWN in PE1. In this 
     case, PE1 should translate this status by sending Active bit = 0 
     in the full status report (and optionally in the asynchronous 
     status message), as per Q.933 annex A, into the local Frame Relay 
     network (L2N1) and for the corresponding FR ACs. In addition, PE1 
     should send a PW status signaling message to the remote PE to 
     convey the status of the affected PWs. PE2 should in turn 
     translate this status into an ATM AIS message to be sent in each 
     of the corresponding ATM ACs. Also, PE2 should change the status 
     of the corresponding Ethernet ACs to DOWN. 
      
     A PW is declared DOWN if any of the conditions described in 
     Section 3.3 are met. 
      
     Defects in location (e) or (f) will result in changing the status 
     of the corresponding ATM ACs or Ethernet ACs to DOWN in PE2. In 
     this case, PE2 should generate a PW status message on each of the 
     corresponding PWs to convey this status to PE1. PE1 should in turn 
     translate this status by sending Active bit = 0 in the full status 
     report (and optionally in the asynchronous status message), as per 
     Q.933 annex A, into the local Frame Relay network and for the 
     corresponding FR ACs. 
      
     An ATM AC is declared DOWN if any of the conditions described in 
     Section 3.4 are met. 
      
     An Ethernet AC is declared DOWN if any of the conditions described 
     in Section 3.6 are met. 

   5.3        IP Interworking VPWS 
       
     The IP interworking VPWS consists of interworking FR, ATM, and 
     Ethernet ACs over the PSN when the PW is of IP type only [ARP-
     MEDIATION]. The heterogeneous VPWS OAM model is used here.

  Internet Draft draft-aissaoui-l2vpn-vpws-iw-oam-00.txt  February 2004 
   
      
     The OAM procedures for this VPWS type are the same as those for 
     the Ethernet Interworking VPWS. See Section 5.2 for details.  
      
   6      Security Considerations 
      
     This draft does not introduce any new security considerations to 
     VPWS. Though, it is worth mentioning that in the heterogeneous 
     VPWS OAM model, a flooding of alarms on the ACs may result in a 
     large number of PW status signaling messages generated. This may 
     have an impact on the performance of the MPLS control plane. This 
     issue should be investigated and solutions should be provided if 
     required. A method for aggregating PW status messages is one 
     possible solution.
