 Abstract 
    
   This paper presents a method to distribute 802.1Q VLAN information 
   across Autonomous Systems using BGP-4. The solution provided here 
   allows to learn VLAN information across Autonomous Systems. The VLAN 
   information and end point discovery presented here is especially 
   useful in providing end-to-end Virtual LAN Services across 
   Autonomous Systems.

2. Introduction 
    
   This paper presents a possible method of distributing 802.1Q VLAN 
   information using BGP. 
    
   With the increasing prospect of MAN (Metropolitan Area Networks) and 
   optical Ethernet solutions, End to End Layer 2 connectivity 
   provisioning is attracting attention. There are several publications 
   that present various tunneling protocols to transport Layer 2 
   traffic across IP Networks. However, there are only few publications 
   available in the area of automatic distribution of VLAN information. 
   Automatic distribution of VLAN information becomes important in 
   large networks, especially where large number of mutually exclusive 
   VLAN topologies exist. 
 
   [3] Paper presents a method of distributing VLAN related information 
   using OSPF Opaque LSA. [4] Presents method of Layer 2 information 
   distribution using BGP. However, level of detail presented here is 
   different to [4]. This paper does not attempt to extend any Layer 1 
   connectivity across MPLS network, rather it provides a VPN sort of 
   connectivity at the Layer 2 level. Concepts and format of VLAN 
   information presented in [3] have been extended in this paper to

   facilitate distribution of VLAN information across Autonomous 
   Systems. 
    
   Unlike, IP address allocations, VLANs are allocated at random and at 
   the will of the customer. As an example, VLAN v1 of customer c1 may 
   not have any co-relation to VLAN v2 of customer c2. This random 
   distribution of VLAN information makes classification of incoming 
   packets to Layer 2 VPN more complex than classification of incoming 
   packets to a Layer 3 VPN. To resolve this we have introduced a 
   concept of VLAN Domain Identifier (VDI). VDI provides a method of 
   distributing, multiple, mutually exclusive Layer 2 topologies on a 
   given network infrastructure. [3] Presents methods to group VLAN 
   ranges within a given VLAN domain. Thus providing a hierarchical and 
   scalable Layer 2 VPN solution. 
    
   In this paper we propose to use BGP multiprotocol extensions to 
   carry proposed VLAN information. The methods used here are similar 
   to [5]. A given update message may carry VLAN Reachability 
   Information for more than one VLAN domain. 
    
3. Typical Deployment Scenario 
    
   Below is a typical scenario where Layer 2 end-to-end service is 
   required. However, the proposed solution is not limited to the 
   scenario below.

   L2 Layer 2 Connectivity 
 
   BB Back Bone Network with BGP 
 
   It is assumed there is a BGP connectivity between each of PE 
   devices. It is assumed that there exists a Layer 2 connectivity 
   between CE and PE (say this is 1 Gig Link). Each PE maintain a VFEC 
   [6] (VLAN Forwarding Equivalence Class) per VLAN Domain.

   PE maintains VFEC entries for locally attached devices. Local VFEC 
   entries are either obtained via static configuration or by some 
   other method. 
 
   PE learns about the VFEC entries in other devices using methods 
   described in this document and [3]. It is the function of the 
   receiving PE to update the appropriate "VLAN domain" VFEC table, 
   according to the incoming VDI field in the BGP update message (see 
   below for details). 
    
   In the above figure, VFEC-1 corresponds to VLAN domain V1. VFEC-1 of 
   PE-1 contain reachability and other information required to reach 
   CE-2 VLAN V1. VLAN information on CE-2 and PE-2 reachability is 
   learnt by PE-1 via BGP extensions presented in this paper. 
   Similarly, VFEC-1 in PE-2 learns reachability and other information 
   about VLAN V1 in CE-1 via BGP extensions presented here.  
 
4. VLAN Domain Identifier (VDI) 
    
   As discussed earlier, there could exist multiple VLAN topologies 
   (domains) within a given IP topology. These VLANs may reside in 
   different Autonomous Systems (AS), these AS may be controlled by 
   different providers. VDI is a two level identifier. VDI identifies 
   both the corresponding AS and VLAN domain ID within the AS. Thus VDI 
   is defined as {AS:Domain_ID}. It is assumed that, two VLAN domains 
   are in the same layer 2 topology, if and only if the VLAN Domain_ID 
   are equal and the remote AS is part of the peering ASs for this 
   {AS:Domain_ID}. The AS-VLAN peering list is manually configured. If 
   there is large number of AS-VLAN peers, one may choose to use 
   Extended Community Attribute for the purpose of matching incoming 
   VDIs to local VDI. As such AS number may be used in conjunction with 
   local policies to accept or reject VLAN reachable information from 
   that Autonomous System (AS).  
    
   Encoding of VDI 
    
   +--------------------------------------+ 
   |  AS  (2 Octets)                      |

   +--------------------------------------+ 
    
   AS 
    
   Autonomous System Identifier 
    
   Domain ID 
    
   VLAN Domain Identity Number. This is a 32-bit number that is 
   assigned with mutual consensus between different AS administrators, 
   who wish to provide connectivity to the specified VLAN domain. 
    
4.1. Use of BGP Extended Communities

   The BGP Communities were defined in [7] to simplify application of 
   complex policies. Without BGP Communities, also known as route 
   coloring [8], implementation of complex policies in large routing 
   environment becomes administratively expensive, if not prohibitive. 
   BGP Community is defined as a 4-octet value. General usage of the 
   community is {AS:ID}; here AS is the 2-octet Autonomous System 
   number and ID is arbitrary 2-octet number. The above proposed VDI 
   numbering scheme follows a similar format as the common community 
   value encoding. As a result there is a risk of these mutually 
   exclusive community strings overlapping. 
    
   The BGP Extended Communities Attribute [9], provides a method to 
   define communities attributes without the risk of overlap. In 
   addition Extended Communities Attribute presented in [9] provides a 
   structured definition of Community Attributes. Thereby, facilitating 
   easy implementation of complex policies. 
    
   In light of the above reasons, in this paper, we suggest to use 
   Extended Communities Attribute to propagate Communities with VLAN 
   distribution information. 
    
   The extended community may be used by BGP routers to implement 
   complex VLAN policies easily. As an example a PE may want to use 
   VLAN reachability announced by a specific PE only for backup 
   purpose. All VLAN reachability learnt from that PE may be tagged 
   with some Extended Community, such that all the VLAN rechability 
   with that community gets a lower priority. 
    
   Presented below is the preferred Extended Communities Attribute 
   encoding for the VLAN distribution. Extended Community sub-Type 
   0x8020 (hex) is proposed for this purpose. However, if the proposal 
   is accepted a specific value for this purpose will be requested 
   through IANA. 
    
   +--------------------------------------+ 
   | Type (2 Octets)=0x8020               | 
   +--------------------------------------+ 
   | AS  (2 Octets)                       | 
   +--------------------------------------+ 
   | VLAN Community ID (4 Octets)         |        
   +--------------------------------------+ 
    
   Type 
    
   Two Octet field, suggested value 0x8020, see [9] for details.

   Community String applied to this update message. NOTE: VLAN 
   Community ID, can be different from Domain_ID field in VDI. This is 
   especially true if a single Extended Community is scoping multiple 
   VLAN Domain distributions in a single update message. 
    
5. Encoding VLAN information in BGP 
    
   BGP-4 Multiprotocol Extensions [10] were designed to carry non IP 
   information in BGP messages. Here we propose to use BGP-4 
   Multiprotcol Extensions to distribute Layer 2 VLAN information and 
   other related services. 
    
   Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) will indicate the 
   receiving routers that this attribute is carrying Layer 2 VLAN 
   information. At present, it is suggested to use 130 (decimal) for 
   SAFI field. Values 0-127 are reserved by IANA. If this proposal is 
   accepted it is suggested that a value in the range of 1-127 is 
   requested from IANA for this purpose. 
    
5.1.1 Multiprotocol Reachable NLRI 
    
   [10] Presents the encoding format of the MP_REACH_NLRI. We intend to 
   use the attribute with no modification to the encoding format. NLRI 
   field in the MP_REACH_NLRI attribute is enhanced to carry proposed 
   VLAN information.

   proposal.

   Number of Labels in the First Label Stack 
    
   Number of Labels in this Stack. Value zero indicates there are no 
   labels associated with this VDI. 
    
   Label Stack 
    
   Label Stack contain one or more 3 octet long labels. The high-order 
   bit contain the bottom of the stack. Remaining 3 high order bits are 
   all reserved. Remaining 20 bits of the label contain the label value 
   [11]. The entries in the Label Stack are zero padded to align with 4 
   octet (32 bit) boundaries. 
    
   The end-devices optionally choose to advertise a MPLS label that 
   could be pushed in to the Label Stack. This label(s) may provide the 
   ability to merge several MPLS tunnels on to a single outgoing tunnel 
   or may define wider forwarding scope at the egress. See Section 10., 
   below for scaling example.

   It may be required to withdraw either an entire VLAN or some subset 
   of services. We suggest that the same encoding format as the VLAN 
   reachability encoding be used in MP-UNREACH-NLRI. 
    
6. Capability Advertisement 
    
   Not all BGP speakers are required to provide Layer 2 tunneling 
   services. However, they may be required to participate in Layer 2 
   VLAN distribution. However, in order to properly handle Multi 
   protocol extensions, all the BGP speakers are required to be MP 
   capable. The MP capability is advertised using the methods specified 
   in [12], with Capability set to 1 with SAFI set to 130 (TBD). 
    
7. Population of VFEC   
    
   Each device that is providing Layer 2 VLAN services maintains a 
   separate instance of VFEC for each VLAN domain (or Domain_ID). Some 
   of the entries are directly attached VLAN information. Directly 
   attached information are either statically configured or learnt by 
   some other mechanism such as [3]. 
    
   BGP acceptance policy populates appropriate VFEC tables with the 
   incoming VLAN distribution information. There may be local policies 
   to reject some VLAN domains from some AS. 
    
   BGP announce policy would announce directly attached (or locally 
   learnt) VLANs via the methods presented here. In some situations  
   there may be local policies to prevent announcing some or all of 
   this VLAN information via BGP. 
    
   Exact format of the VFEC depends on the Layer 2 tunneling protocol 
   being implemented. [6] Presents VFEC format for MPLS based layer 2 
   tunnels. Details of the format and the construction of the VFEC is 
   implementation dependent and beyond the scope of this document.

   Suppose AS 4 is providing transitive services to AS 1, 2 and 3. In 
   this scenario, AS 4 may aggregate all the VLAN information from AS 3 
   and advertise to AS 1 and AS 2 and vice versa. As explained in [13], 
   AS 4 may advertise a single label to both AS 1 and 2. AS 1 and 2, in 
   turn can use this Label, either as the top label or part of the 
   Label Stack to merge traffic going to AS 3, thereby providing 
   effective scaling in large deployments. 
    
9. VLAN Distribution over E-BGP Sessions 
    
   The concepts presented here together with AS local policies can be 
   used for inter-AS VLAN distribution. Extended Communities presented 
   in section 4.1 may be useful in implementing complex policies such 
   as backup paths etc. The key is, the concepts presented here use the 
   BGP Multiprotocol extensions to distribute VLAN information, as a 
   result most of the E-BGP methods used in IP routing can be easily 
   implemented. 
    
10. VLAN Distribution over I-BGP Sessions 
    
   Use of IGP such as OSPF to distribute VLAN information within a 
   large Autonomous system may lead to scaling issues, specially in 
   environment where, changes to the VLAN topology is frequent. 
   However, it is noted here, that calculations such as SPF (Shortest 
   Path First) is not performed on VLAN Distribution Information. 
   Hence, the impact may be less critical than that of classical IP 
   routing. In any case use of I-BGP may provide better manageability 
   and imperative if the AS is multi homed and providing transitive 
   services. 
    
   Full meshed network topology is a fundamental requirement of 
   classical I-BGP. This requirement leads to scaling issues in large 
   networks and possibly makes I-BGP administratively prohibitive. 
   There are several solutions to circumvent the need of fully meshed 
   I-BGP topology. Route Reflector concept presented in [14] provides a 
   method to construct manageable I-BGP peer network. There are no 
   additional changes needed to distribute VLAN information using Route 
   Reflector methods explained in [14], except that BGP speakers are 
   able to understand BGP-MP extensions [10] and Extended Communities 
   attributes [9]. 
    
11. Security Considerations 
    
   This implementation does not affect the underlying security 
   requirements of BGP-4.
