   In this draft we present NEst Route Optimization for NEMO (NERON)

   at enabling nodes behind nested mobile networks to use optimized 
   communication paths with zero tunneling overhead and minimum end-to-
   end delay, irrespective of the depth of the nest, with minimum but 
   manageable changes to the base MIPv6 and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery 
   protocols and without introducing any new network entities.

1. Requirements notation 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1]. 

2. Introduction 

   IETF's Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support Protocol [2] proposes 
   the mobility management protocol for Mobile Networks which enables 
   Mobile Network Nodes (MNN) inside the Mobile Network behind a Mobile 
   Router (MR) to communicate with Correspondent Node CN(s) via a 
   bidirectional tunnel maintained between the MR and its Home Agent 
   (HA). Thus [2] doesn't redress and specify the route optimization 
   (RO) solution that would enable direct communication between MNNs and 
   CN(s) over optimized paths without involving any tunnels and 
   bypassing the HA(s) associated with MR(s). 

   The performance issues linked to the absence of any RO solution in 
   mobile networks, which has been detailed in [3], becomes more 
   conspicuous in case of nested mobile networks and gets compounded 
   with every incremental increase in the nest depth. 

   RFC 4889 [4] gives a very detailed account of the solution space of 
   RO in Mobile networks and nested mobile networks by encompassing the 
   different issues and scenarios referenced in [3]. 

   There are solutions available that address either complete or part of 
   the RO issue in nested Mobile networks but the common goal of any 
   solution is to enable a RO solution which fulfills the requirements 
   specified in [3] and [4]. 

   However a close review of the proposed solutions, which would be 
   referenced in the subsequent sections, reveals that the RO solution 
   for nested mobile networks has the tendency of being over-engineered 
   by over estimating the architectural scope of a mobile network, which 
   in fact is limited within very closed and well defined confines of 
   mobile entities such as cars, busses, trains, aircrafts, ships, etc. 
   In such an environment the size of the Mobile network can not exceed 
   beyond a certain constant limit (in terms of nodes) and degree of 
   complexity (in terms of network architecture). A conservative

   estimate is that the probability of the nest depth to increase beyond 
   a nest depth of 3 is very small. 

   With this perspective in consideration, we propose Nest Route 
   Optimization in NEMO (NERON) which is a light weight, efficient and 
   scaleable RO solution for nested, non-nested and intra-NEMO mobile 
   network scenarios and is designed within the boundaries defined in 
   [3] and [4]. NERON is light weight in the sense that it does not 
   introduce any new network entities and utilizes the available MIPv6 
   [5] and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [6] protocol messages with minimum 
   but manageable changes to them. 

3. Terminology 

   This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the mobility 
   related terms defined in [5] and [7], and particularly with the 
   network mobility terms introduced in [8]. The user must also be 
   familiar with the terms defined in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol 
   as defined in [6]. 

   The following term is used additionally in this document. 

   NEMO Prefix:  

      The on-link prefix(es) advertised by the nested MRs as part of 
      the Route Notification Process. 

4. Assumptions 

   There are RO solutions proposed in the context of nested mobile 
   networks like MANEMO [9], ONEMO [10], MIRON [11] being more 
   prominent. However a close review of the proposed solutions reveal 
   that the RO solution has the tendency of being over-engineered by 
   over estimating the architectural and functional scope of a mobile 
   network, which in fact is limited within very closed and well defined 
   confines of mobile entities such as cars, busses, trains, aircrafts, 
   ships, etc. In such an environment the size of a mob network can not 
   exceed beyond a certain constant limit (in terms of nodes) and degree 
   of complexity (in terms of network architecture). A conservative 
   estimate is that the probability of the nest depth to increase beyond 
   a nest depth of 3 is very small. 

   Also MIPv6 is now becoming a standard part of an OS kernel, such as 
   Linux, and therefore it is safe to assume that in the very near 
   future all nodes will have inherent support for MIPv6.

   With the above considerations in perspective the following 
   assumptions are made while proposing the NERON solution: 

   o  The mobile network environment is limited in terms of size and 
      number of users. 

   o  The MNN are assumed to be fixed LFN with no mobility support. 
      Although NERON operation makes provision for MIPv6 capable VMN to 
      travel as part of the mobile network however its position in the 
      domain of the mobile network is depth independent.  

   o  The Correspondent Node (CN) is MIPv6 aware. This eliminates the 
      need to introduce Correspondent Router (CR). 

   o  The CN is a fixed node, either in the Internet or sharing the same 
      mobile network domain as the corresponding MNN. 

   o  The root-MR (rMR) will connect to the infrastructure network with 
      a single egress interface. 

   o  The visiting MR will connect to the rMR forming a hierarchical 
      nested architecture rather than a flat configuration. 

5. Problem Statement 

   The current NBSP [2] does not specify any RO mechanism and the 
   problems and issues related to the absence of any RO mechanism with 
   reference to mobile networks is listed in detail in [3]. 

   According to [3], all data packets to and from the MNNs are tunneled 
   through the HA of its MR i.e., over sub-optimal routes, even though a 
   shorter and more optimized path may exist between the MNN and the CN. 
   In case of nested mobile networks, these data packets then traverse 
   multiple HAs with multiple levels of encapsulation. This would limit 
   the overall performance and give rise to various performance which 
   are summarized as follows: 

   1. Longer routes leading to increased delay and additional 
      infrastructure load posing crucial problems for real-time 
      applications and video streaming. 

   2. Increased susceptibility to link failures due to the packets 
      traversing longer routes. 

   3. Increase packet overhead due to tunneling and maintaining tunnels 
      within tunnels thus reducing the overall bandwidth efficiency.

   4. Increased processing delay due to successive encapsulation and 
      decapsulation. 

   5. Increased probability of packet fragmentation due to successive 
      tunneling of packets leading towards non-negligible packet loss. 

6. Design Goals 

   The design goal of NERON is to develop a light-weight and scalable RO 
   solution by utilizing and leveraging the existing MIPv6 [5] and IPv6 
   Neighbor Discovery [6] protocols with minimum but manageable changes 
   to them and without introducing any additional network entity and/or 
   third party support protocol(s). 

   The solution space of NERON encompasses all the major considerations 
   and requirements defined in [4] and summarized as follows: 

   o  To enable the intercommunication between MNN and corresponding 
      CN(s) over optimized paths without requiring to traverse any and 
      all HA(s) irrespective of the nest depth. 

   o  Enable direct intra-communication between MNN and CN when CN may 
      exist within the same domain of the mobile network as the MNN. 

   o  To completely eliminate the possibility of establishing any 
      tunnels between any network entities involved in the 
      infrastructure. 

   o  Reuse existing protocols such as MIPv6 and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery 
      protocol with minimum changes to the existing messages and network 
      infrastructure. 

   o  Abstain from introducing any new network entities or changes that 
      would require drastic changes in the network infrastructure. 

7. Network Mobility Background 

   In this section we give a summarized account of how NEMO protocol 
   manages the handover of mobile networks and how data packets are 
   routed between the CN(s) and MNN(s). 

7.1. General Handover Process in Mobile Networks 

   According to [2], a mobile network consists of several MNNs attached 
   to a MR's ingress interface whereas the MR connects the mobile 
   network to the Internet via its egress interface.  The MNNs are 
   unaware of the mobility of the mobile network.

Internet-Draft                  NERON                       August 2008 
    

   When a mobile network is at its home network, it is identified and 
   reachable via its Home Address (HoA), which is auto-configured [12] 
   or assigned [13] on the MR's egress interface based on the Home 
   Agent's (HA) advertised address prefix on the home link. The prefix 
   advertised on the MR's ingress interface inside the mobile network is 
   called a Mobile Network Prefix (MNP), which is delegated from the 
   subnet owned by the HA, and the MNNs configure their addresses with 
   the advertised MNP. When the Mobile Network is away from its home 
   network, the MR configures a Care-of-Address (CoA) on its egress 
   interface only according to the prefix advertised by the access 
   router (AR) of the visit network infrastructure whereas the address 
   of the MR's ingress interfaces, and hence those of the MNNs remain 
   unchanged. The MR will register its CoA with its HA through an 
   exchange of binding update (BU) and binding acknowledgment (BA) 
   message pair, and the HA will in turn create a binding between the 
   MR's CoA and its respective MNP(s) with the MR's Home Address (HoA), 
   all conveyed by the BU message, in a locally maintained cache called 
   Binding Cache (BC). After a successful binding, a bi-directional 
   tunnel is created between the HA and the MR. A packet addressed to a 
   MNN is first routed to its HA, which will intercept the packet and 
   tunnel it to the CoA of the MR, which in turn will decapsulate the 
   outer header of the packet and forward it to the MNN. In the reverse 
   direction the MR will encapsulate the packet originating from the MNN 
   and tunnels it to its respective HA, which in turn will decapsulate 
   the outer header of the packet and forward it to the destination 
   based on Internet routing mechanism. 

7.2. Non-optimum Packet Routing in Mobile Networks 

   The basic task of NEMO Basic Support Protocol (NBSP) is to utilize 
   the MIPv6 protocol operation and integrate it into the realm of 
   mobile networks, however this introduces severe performance 
   limitation in terms of sub-optimal communication paths for packets of 
   the MNN as it has to traverse, in both directions, the MR's HA via a 
   bidirectional tunnel established between the MR and its corresponding 
   HA. This sub-optimal routing of packets, also called 'triangular 
   routing', is due to the fact that [2] does not specify any RO 
   mechanism; a mechanism enabling MNN(s) and CN(s) to communicate 
   directly over optimum routes as determined by generic Internet 
   routing protocols and bypassing any or all HAs minimizing the 
   possibility of establishing and maintaining tunnel(s) between the MNN 
   and CN(s). The problems associated with sub-optimal routing have 
   already been highlighted in section 5 above. 

   This problem gets compounded when other MRs (and hence mobile 
   networks) attach behind another MR (or mobile network) in a 
   hierarchical fashion forming a larger mobile network. In such a

   cluster of mobile networks a MR that has connectivity to an 
   infrastructure AR is called a root-MR (rMR) and the MR behind the rMR 
   is called a nest-MR (nMR), and such a topology is termed as ``nest 
   topology'' and the network is called nested mobile network [8]. 

   Although NBSP does not prevent the formation of such a nested 
   architecture but, in the absence of any RO mechanism, when a CN 
   communicates with a MNN located behind a nMR. (where . is the depth 
   of the nest and rMR, which acts as a gateway to the nested mobile 
   network, is considered at depth .=0), the packets of the MNN will 
   traverse over (.+1) HAs (i.e., through the HAs of all the upper level 
   mobile networks present in the nest chain) thereby undergoing (.+1) 
   encapsulations/decapsulations in both directions. This problem gets 
   exacerbated especially in the case of two inter-communicating MNNs 
   belonging to different nMRs but located within the same rMR domain. 
   In such a case the number of encapsulations undergone by a packet 
   will double than the case when the MNN is communicating with a 
   Correspondent Node (CN) outside its mobile network domain. This is 
   also called "pin-ball" routing problem [4]. 

8. NERON Protocol Overview 

   The NERON protocol proposes a MIPv6 based RO solution which is 
   independent of the nest depth. The NERON process, similar to other RO 
   solutions such as MANEMO [9] and ONEMO [10], consists of the 
   following three essential steps namely; 

   o  Nest formation and mobile network gateway discovery. 

   o  Route notification within the rMR nested domain. 

   o  Return Routability and binding registration. 

   The proceeding sub-sections will elaborate the above three essential 
   operational steps. 

8.1. Nest Formation and Mobile Network Gateway Discovery 

   It is important for a visit MR (VMR) to detect the presence of a 
   Mobile Network domain behind which it can nest and acquire not only 
   the address of the rMR's egress interface, as this will be the 
   gateway for all the nMRs nested behind rMR, but also compute its 
   position in terms of the depth in the the nested architecture. 

   When a mobile network, such as a PAN, enters the domain of another 
   mobile network, it has to first detect and connect to the rMR as  
   nMR. The nMR will be able to distinguish a MR from a regular AR based

   on the status of the R-flag carried by the periodically advertised RA 
   message. When set it will indicate the AR is acting as a MR in which 
   case the RA's are advertised periodically over the ingress 
   interface(s) only and received and processed by the egress 
   interface(s). The RA MUST also carry the new Mobile Network Gateway 
   (MNG) option (see section 11.3.1) which conveys the rMR's depth in 
   the nest (which is 0 by default) and also the address assigned to its 
   egress interface (which can be a HoA or CoA, depending on the rMR 
   location). The receiving nMR will cache the rMR's egress interface 
   address and the incremented value of the "depth" parameter in its 
   two-field Nest Gate Table (NGT) (see section 10). 

   A non-zero Nest-Position value in the local NGT implies that the MR 
   is nested behind a MR as nMR at a depth indicated by the Nest-
   Position value (see section 10). 

   The nMR in turn MUST include the entry of its local NGT in the 
   appropriate fields of the MNG option of the RA messages advertised 
   periodically over its respective ingress interface(s). In other words 
   the nMR will relay the assigned address of the rMR's egress interface 
   to other nMRs deep inside the nest which in turn will relay it 
   further deeper in the nest using the RA message and this relaying 
   will continue till the last MR in the nest. All nMRs will also store 
   an incremented value of the received Depth field (D-Field) value in 
   the MNG option indicating its depth and position in the nest.  In 
   this way all nMRs will not only compute their position in the nest 
   but will also be informed of the rMR's egress interface address that 
   will be stored by the nMRs in their respective NGT. 

8.1.1. Loop Avoidance and Nest Depth Identification 

   Since the egress interface of a MR will be able to listen to the RA 
   messages advertised not only from its local ingress interface(s) but 
   also by the ingress interface(s) of the nMR(s), there is a 
   possibility of the MR to form loop either with itself or with its 
   nMR. To achieve loop-less connectivity the MR will compare the 
   advertised prefix(es) with its home prefix and also with the nest-
   depth value in the NGT. If the advertised "depth" value is greater 
   than the value stored in the local NGT and/or if the advertised 
   prefix matches the home prefix of the egress interface, then in such 
   case(s) the MR will drop/ignore the RA and not attempt connection 
   with the MR. NERON specifies that only the egress interface of the MR 
   should configure CoA as it roams whereas the ingress interface(s) 
   address(es) should remain the same as acquired at the home network. 
   At the home network of a MR, both ingress and egress interface will 
   configure addresses using the prefix of the home agent.

   In order to prevent against race condition i.e., in situation when 
   both MRs will be advertising depth value of 0 in its MNG option, then 
   this will be decided by the state of the P-flag in MNG option (See 
   section 11.3.1 for details). 

   In comparison to NERON, the MANEMO project follows the TD [14] 
   protocol to achieve the above tasks but it uses a much larger and 
   complex 32B Tree Information Option (TIO) with further 5 different 
   sub-options (potentially increasing the size of TIO sub-option to an 
   additional 34B) in its RA message. The extensive and complicated TIO 
   sub-option not only accounts for large size RA messages but also 
   accounts for complexity in terms of logic processing. In contrast 
   NERON uses a 20B fixed size MNG sub-option accounting for smaller RA 
   packets and straightforward processing of the RA message. A similar 
   approach is adopted by ONEMO [10] but ONEMO does not specify how a MR 
   will compute its position in the nest and how to ensure loop-less 
   connectivity. 

   The decision mechanism of the MR concerning preferred rMR is out-of-
   scope of this work and hence should rely on some decision algorithms. 

8.2. Route Notification 

   This is a crucial process that would furnish the routing tables of 
   MRs, within a nested domain, with the information necessary to route 
   data packets between CN and MNN irrespective of the depth of the MNN. 

   After the VMR nests behind a rMR and updates its NGT, it will send an 
   Unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement (UNA) message [6] over its egress 
   interface with the Override flag (O-flag) set to 0. This UNA will 
   convey the respective nMR's egress interface's link local address and 
   respective MNPs embedded in the newly defined "Route Notification 
   Option" (RNO) (see section 11.3.2). 

   A MR upon receiving the UNA on one of its ingress interface will 
   update its local routing table with the MNPs carried by the UNA and 
   assign/specify the corresponding link local address carried by the 
   same UNA message as the next hop address to reach the listed MNPs. If 
   the receiving MR is a nMR (in case depth value listed in local NGT is 
   not 0), it will relay the UNA to the next higher MR by replacing the 
   previous nMR's link local address with the link local address of its 
   own (the relaying MR) egress interface leaving the MNP entries 
   untouched. The next higher MR upon receiving the UNA will add/update 
   its routing table and relay it to the next higher MR as explained 
   above. In this way the routing tables of all the MR will get updated 
   with all the MNPs that are present in the nest and an appropriate

   next hop address will also be assigned for correct routing of the 
   packets. 

   A Relay flag (R-Flag) is added to the RNO which when set will 
   indicate to the next higher MR to relay the MNP carried by the RNO to 
   the next higher MR in the nest chain in case it is not a rMR. 

   The UNA is transmitted on the egress interface(s) and received and 
   processed on the ingress interface(s). 

   In contrast to a much simpler and smaller RNO, NINA [15] uses a new 
   NA message termed as Network In Node Advertisement (NINA) to relay 
   the MNPs up the tree. NINA is a NA message with a 32B Network In Node 
   Option (NINO) as compared to 24B Route Noticiation option which is 
   less complex than NINO. Also NINA/NINO depends on the Tree Discovery 
   protocol [14] before it can relay the MNPs.  

8.3. Return Routability and Binding Registration 

   As proposed in [2] and specified in MIRON [11], NERON uses the MIPv6 
   based Return Routability (RR) procedure [5] but unlike MIRON its 
   performance is independent of the nest depth. 

   In NERON, the MR of the MNN will perform home registration with its 
   HA as specified in [2]. After successful home registration, the MR 
   will perform MIPv6 specified RR procedure on behalf of the MNN as 
   specified in [11]. After a successful RR procedure with the CN, the 
   MR, on behalf of the MNN, will send a BU carrying the rMR's address 
   (accessed from its NGT) in the newly defined Nest Gate Option (NGO) 
   (see section 11.3.3). It should be noted that the BU is triggered 
   every time the entry in the NGT changes indicating a handover of the 
   Mobile Network. The CN upon receiving the BU, will process it as 
   specified in [2] and [11] and additionally it will extract the 
   address carried in the NGO and records the rMR's address in its 
   Binding Cache (BC) entry. The CN will send a Binding Acknowledgment 
   thus completing the RO and correspondent registration process. 

9. Data Communication between MNN and CN 

   After the mobile network has handed over and RO process completes, 
   the packets between MNN and CN will then flow over optimized paths 
   bypassing any and/or all HA(s) without any tunneling over head. NERON 
   address the following two scenarios in terms of data communication 
   between CN and MNN: 

   o  When CN is part of the Internet infrastructure.

Internet-Draft                  NERON                       August 2008 
    

   o  When CN and MNN share the same mobile network domain. 

   It should be noted that the CN in both cases are assumed to be non-
   mobile i.e., a standard host in the Internet or an LFN in the mobile 
   network (see section 4).  

9.1. When CN Is Part of the Internet Infrastructure 

   The communication flow between CN and MNN over optimized path is as 
   follows: 

9.1.1. MNN Sending Packets to CN 

   When a MR receives a packet from its MNN destined to the CN, it will 
   replace the source address of the IPv6 header with the CoA assigned 
   to its egress interface and put the address of the MNN in the Home 
   Address Destination option [5]. All the other nMRs on the path to the 
   rMR will simply forward this packet until it reaches the rMR. The rMR 
   will then forward the packet normally to the CN and hence the packet 
   arrives at the CN with no encapsulation and via a direct optimized 
   route bypassing the HAs. 

9.1.2. CN Sending Packets to MNN 

   When a CN wants to a send a packet to a nested MNN, it will first 
   search its BC for a valid cached entry for the packet's destination 
   address. If the packet's destination address is found listed in the 
   BC, the CN will then check if a Nest Gate entry (see section 10) 
   exists for the destination. If a valid Nest Gate address is present 
   in the BC, the CN knows that the MNN resides inside a nested mobile 
   network and composes the packet as follows; 

   o  The source address field in the IPv6 header is set to the CN 
      address. 

   o  The destination address field in the IPv6 header is set to the 
      Nest Gate address found in the BC entry. 

   o  The CoA of the nMR found in the BC entry corresponding to the 
      MNN's destination prefix, and the MNN destination address are 
      contained in the newly defined Type 3 Routing Header (T3RH) 
      address vector (see section 11.1). The T3RH gets processed only by 
      the destination router. 

   When receiving the packet with a T3RH, the rMR replaces the 
   destination address with the nMR's CoA found in the T3RH address 
   vector. Since inside the nest routes have already been exchanged

Internet-Draft                  NERON                       August 2008 
    

   between the MRs as part of the route notification process (see 
   section 8.2), the rMR, and the subsequent MRs nested behind the rMR, 
   will route the packet to the destination nMR using standard routing 
   algorithm. The destined nMR will then replace the packet's 
   destination address with the address of the MNN carried inside the 
   T3RH address vector and the packet eventually gets delivered to the 
   MNN without any tunneling over head. 

9.2. When CN and MNN Share the Same Mobile Network Domain 

   If the MNN and CN are connected behind different MRs that are 
   connected to the same nested mobile network, that is they share the 
   same rMR domain, then without RO, the intercommunicated packets will 
   leave the mobile network to be tunneled back into the same mobile 
   network following a pinball route [3].  

   NERON solution inherently provides reachable destinations to all MRs 
   inside the nest connected to the rMR by a combination of Route 
   Notification process described in section 8.2 and by advertising off-
   link prefixes (NEMO prefixes) of other MRs inside the nest received 
   via the Route Notification process in the prefix information option 
   of the RA message.  

   When advertising the NEMO prefix in the prefix information option 
   [6], both the On-link flag (L-Flag) and the Autonomous Address-
   Configuration Flag (A-Flag) MUST be set to zero while the newly 
   defined Update flag (U-Flag) (see section 11.2.3) MUST be set. The 
   combined status of these flags will indicate that the specified 
   prefix MUST be used by MRs to update its local routing table with 
   destination prefixes set to the received prefix and the next hop 
   address set to the source address of the received RA message. 

   This combined exchanged of Route Notification messages via UNA and 
   NEMO prefixes via unsolicited RA messages prevents against the 
   pinball routing problem by enabling the MNN and CN to 
   intercommunicate directly without having the packets leave the mobile 
   network domain and thus dramatically reduce the packet round trip 
   delay and packet overhead in terms of successive tunneling and de-
   tunneling. 

10. Data Structures 

   Mention the NGT and the small modification in the CN's BC. 

   The NERON protocol defines a new Nest Gate Table (NGT) maintained by 
   each MR. The NGT conceptual data structure consists of the following 
   fields:

Internet-Draft                  NERON                       August 2008 
    

   o  Nest Position: The position of the respective MR in terms of its 
      depth inside the nested mobile network's nest hierarchy. The MR 
      will calculate its position in the nest hierarchy by incrementing 
      the value carried in the Depth field of the RA's "Mobile Network 
      Gateway" Option (see section 11.3.1).   

   o  Mobile Network Gateway: The globally unique IPv6 address 
      configured and assigned to the rMR's egress interface. The MR will 
      update this field in the NGT from the information received in the 
      RA's "Mobile Network Gateway" Option (see section 11.3.1).  

   Besides NGT, NERON proposes to modify the binding cache of the CN [5] 
   by adding the "Nest Gate" field which will contain the rMR's egress 
   interface address received in the Nest Gate Option of the BU message  
   (see section 11.3.3).   

11. Message Formats 

   The NERON protocol introduces a new routing header called a Type-3 
   Routing header (T3RH) and makes use of the existing MIPv6 [5] and 
   IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol [6] with minimum but manageable 
   modifications and new message sub-options. 

11.1. Type-3 Routing Header 

   NERON defines a new routing header variant, the Type 3 Routing Header 
   (T3RH), to allow the packet to be routed directly from a CN to the 
   MNN inside the nested mobile network without any tunneling overhead.  

   This routing header type is restricted to carry two IPv6 addresses; 
   the nMR's CoA (the address of the egress interface) and the 
   associated MNN address. The rMR's egress interface address is 
   inserted into the IPv6 Destination Address field. 

   Once the packet arrives at the rMR's egress interface, it will swap 
   the destination address of the IPv6 header with the nMR's CoA inside 
   the T3RH and forward the packet inside the mobile network. The packet 
   upon reaching the relevant nMR will then replace the MNN address in 
   the IPv6 destination address field from the T3RH, and this is used as 
   the final destination address for the packet. The nMR will remove the 
   routing header and forward the packet to the required MNN. 

   The T3RH is used instead of the Type 2 Routing Header [5] whenever 
   the CN is sending data packets towards MNN that resides inside a 
   mobile network. See section 9 to understand how CN determines whether 
   the MNN is inside a mobile network or is connected to the Internet 
   infrastructure.

   The NERON protocol modifies the format of the MIPv6 specified router 
   advertisement message [5] by the addition of a single flag bit to 
   differentiate a MR from a regular infrastructure AR.

                  Reduced from a 5-bit field to a 4-bit field to account

11.2.2. Modified Neighbor Advertisement Message 

   The NERON protocol modifies the format of the IPv6 Neighbor 
   Discovery's neighbor advertisement message [6] by the addition of a 
   single flag bit to differentiate a MR from a regular infrastructure 
   AR. The MR will send unsolicited neighbor advertisement (UNA) to 
   advertise the MNPs of the local and nested MRs up to the higher MR in 
   the nest hierarchy/chain. The UNA is transmitted only on the egress 
   interface and received and processed at the ingress interface. The 
   receiving MR will update its local routing table by assigning the 
   link local address as the next hop address to reach the address 
   prefix(es) carried by the same UNA.

                  Carries the prefix of the MR's ingress interface. This 
                  option MUST be included, when the M-flag is set. The 
                  advertisement may carry multiple such options. 

11.2.3. Modified Prefix Information Option 

   The format of the modified prefix information option carried by the 
   RA message is shown in figure 4. 

   This format represents the following changes over that originally 
   specified in [5]: 

       Update Flag (U)  
                  When set indicates that the prefix option MUST be 
                  processed by the MR and that the advertised prefix is 
                  a NEMO prefix that MUST be used by the MR to update 
                  its local routing table and using the source IP 
                  address of the RA message as the next hop address to 
                  reach this prefix/address.  

       Reserved            
                  Reduced from a 5-bit field to a 4-bit field to account 
                  for the addition of the U-flag bit.

11.3. New Message Options 

   NERON defines two new message sub-options. 

11.3.1. Mobile Network Gateway Option 

   This option is included in the router advertisement message 
   advertised periodically by the MRs on their ingress interfaces. This 
   option MUST be included whenever the R-flag is set. This message 
   option carries the address configured on the rMR's egress interface 
   and also notifies its position in terms of nest-depth. The receiving 
   MR will compute its position in the nest by incrementing the depth 
   value specified in this option.   

   The format of the message is shown in figure 4.

       Length             
                  8-bit unsigned integer. Indicates length of the option 
                  field. 

      Primary Flag (P)  
                  When set indicates that the MR is attached to a non-
                  mobile infrastructure AR. This flag will eliminate the 
                  race condition that may occur when a MR enters the 
                  domain of another MR and both have the same Depth 
                  value.  

       Depth Field (D)                   
                  This 3-bit field indicates the position of the 
                  advertising MR in terms of nest depth. The rMR will 
                  always have a depth value of zero by default and 
                  incremented by 1 by the nMR (which receives this 
                  option) indicating the depth of its location. 

       Prefix Length                 
                  The prefix length indicates the number of significant 
                  bits of the rMR's CoA. This will enable a MIPv6 
                  capable VMN to derive a topologically correct CoA for 
                  initiating its MIPv6 handover process. This option 
                  will allow MIPv6 enabled node to co-locate and operate 
                  from within the domain of a mobile network.

                  the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver. 

       Root Mobile Router CoA                 
                  The global unicast address assigned/configured on the 
                  egress interface of the root mobile router (rMR). It 
                  may be a HoA or a CoA depending on the location of the 
                  rMR. This value is stored by the receiving MR in its 
                  Nest Gate Table and is relayed down to the next MR in 
                  its respective RA message. This option enables all the 
                  MRs nested behind the same rMR get information about 
                  the rMR's CoA.  

11.3.2. Route Notification Option 

   This option MUST be carried by the unsolicited neighbor advertisement 
   message whenever the M-flag is set. The MR will convey the MNP that 
   may be local or received from a nMR in a similar option to the next 
   higher MR.

11.3.3. Nest Gate Option 

   This option MUST be carried by the BU message sent by the nMR on 
   behalf of the LFN during correspondent registration. It carries the 
   address of the mobile network gateway i.e., the address of the rMR's 
   egress interface. After the successful completion of the return 
   Routability procedure (see section 8.3), the rMR/nMR will search and 
   acquire the rMR's egress interface address from its Nest Gate Table 
   and include this address in the Nest Gate Option and append it to the 
   BU.

   The format of the Nest Gate option is shown in figure 6 and it is 
   similar to the MIPv6 Alternate Care-of-Address option but with a 
   different type.  

12. Security Considerations 

   NERON follows the security aspects defined in [5] and [2]. For packet 
   transmission it uses the IPSec features of IPv6. Further security 
   considerations are still under investigation. 

13. IANA Considerations 

   This document requires IANA to assign numbers to the Type value of 
   the 3 message options namely; Nest Gate Option, Route Notification 
   Option and Mobile Network Gateway Option.

14. Conclusions 

   NERON is a light weight scalable RO solution that is independent of 
   the MNN depth in a nested mobile network and it utilizes the existing 
   MIPv6 and Neighbor Discovery Protocol constructs with minor but 
   manageable modifications to the existing messages. NERON does not 
   introduce any new network entity and all the protocol complexity is 
   limited within the scope of a MR. It tackles the issues described in 
   [3] and encompasses the solution space prescribed in [4]. All of the 
   above considerations makes NERON ideal for quick and early 
   deployment.
