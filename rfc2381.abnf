CLP=0 cells.  This conformance definition SHOULD always be used with
PCR = p_r
SCR = R
MBS = b_r.

PCR = p_r
SCR = r_r
MBS = b_r.

CDV = D_ATM
CTD = D_ATM + MPL.

CTD = D_ATM + MPL + S_ATM
CDV = D_ATM + S_ATM.

B = number of IP-packet Bytes,
H = number of AAL-5 header bytes (LLC/SNAP etc.)
C = number of cells,

C = B/48,

C = floor[(H + B + 8 + 47)/48]
