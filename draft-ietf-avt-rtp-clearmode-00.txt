Abstract 
    
   This document describes how to carry 64 kbit/s data streams trans-
   parently in RTP packets, using a pseudo-codec called "Clearmode". 
   It also serves as registration for a related MIME type called 
   "audio/clearmode". 
   "Clearmode" is a basic feature of VoIP media gateways.

1. Introduction 
    
   Voice over IP media gateways need to carry all data streams generated 
   by analog or ISDN terminals via an IP network. 
   ISDN wideband speech terminals do not rely on a voice data processing 
   (e.g. echo cancellation or DTMF detection) within a Voice over IP 
   media gateway. And ISDN data terminals e.g. will produce data streams 
   that are not compatible with a non-linear encoding as is used for 
   voice. 
   For such applications, there exists a necessity for a transparent 
   relay of 64 kbit/s data streams in RTP packets. This mode is often 
   referred to as "clear-channel data" or "64 kbit/s unrestricted". No 
   encoder/decoder is needed in that case, but a unique RTP [6] payload 
   type is necessary and a related MIME type is to be registered for 
   signaling purposes. 
    
   This payload format document describes a pseudo-codec called 
   "Clearmode", for sample-oriented 64 kbit/s data streams with 8 bits 
   per sample. It is in accordance with RFC 2736 [3], which provides a 
   guideline for the specification of new RTP payload formats. 
    
   Examples for the use of Clearmode in current VoIP media gateways are 
   the transfer of "ISDN 7 kHz voice" and "ISDN data". 
    
   This document also serves as the MIME type registration according RFC 
   2048 [5], which defines procedures for registration of new MIME types 
   within the IETF tree. 
    
    
2. 64 kbit/s data stream handling and RTP header parameters 
    
   Clearmode does not use any encoding or decoding. It just provides 
   packetization.

   Clearmode assumes that the data to be handled is sample oriented with 
   one octet (8bits) per sample. There is no restriction on the number 
   of samples per packet. 
    
   The payload handling for Clearmode is similar to the PCMU or PCMA 
   handling described in [7]. Each Clearmode octet SHALL be octet-
   aligned in a RTP packet. 
    
   A sample rate of 8000 Hz is used. 
   This calculates to a 64 kbit/s transmission rate per channel. 
    
   The Timestamp SHALL be set according to [6]. 
    
   The marker bit is always zero. 
   Silence suppression is not applicable for Clearmode data streams. 
    
   The payload type is dynamically assigned by means outside the scope 
   of this document. 
    
   This document specifies the use of RTP over unicast and multicast UDP 
   as well as TCP. 
   (This does not preclude the use of this definition when RTP is 
   carried by other lower-layer protocols.) 
    
    
3. Registration of audio/clearmode 
    
   To: ietf-types@iana.org 
    
   Subject: Registration of MIME media type audio/clearmode 
    
   MIME media type name: audio 
    
   MIME subtype name: clearmode 
    
   Required parameters: none 
    
   Optional parameters: ptime, maxptime 
          "ptime" gives the length of time in milliseconds represented 
          by the media in a packet [9]. 
          "maxptime" represents the maximum amount of media which can be 
          encapsulated in each packet, expressed as time in milliseconds 
          [9]. 
    
   Encoding considerations: 
          This type is defined for transfer via RTP [6]. 
    
   Security considerations: 
          Implementations using the profile defined in this

          specification are subject to the security considerations 
          discussed in the RTP specification [6]. 
    
   Interoperability considerations: none 
    
   Published specification: This document 
    
   Applications which use this media type: 
          Voice over IP Media Gateways, transferring "ISDN 64 kb/s data" 
          or "ISDN 7 kHz voice" or other VoIP-related 64 kbit/s data 
          streams via a RTP connection. 
    
   Additional information: none 
    
   Intended usage: COMMON 
    
   Author/Change controller: 
          This registration is part of the IETF registration tree. 
    
    
4. Mapping to SDP parameters 
    
   Parameters are mapped to SDP [9] in a standard way. 
    
       o  The MIME type (audio) goes in SDP "m=" as the media name. 
    
       o  The MIME subtype (clearmode) goes in SDP "a=rtpmap" as the 
          encoding name. 
    
       o  The optional parameters "ptime" and "maxptime" go in the SDP 
          "a=ptime" and "a=maxptime" attributes, respectively. 
    
    
   An example mapping is as follows: 
    
           audio/clearmode; ptime=10 
    
           m=audio 12345 RTP/AVP 97 
           a=rtpmap:97 CLEARMODE/8000 
           a=ptime:10 
    
   Note that the payload format (encoding) names defined in the RTP 
   Profile are commonly shown in upper case.  MIME subtypes are commonly 
   shown in lower case.  These names are case-insensitive in both 
   places. 
   Similarly, parameter names are case-insensitive both in MIME types 
   and in the default mapping to the SDP a=fmtp attribute.

5. Security Considerations 
    
   Implementations using the profile defined in this specification are 
   subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP 
   specification [6]. 
   This profile does not specify any different security services. The 
   primary function of this profile is to add a transparent transport 
   for a 64 kbit/s data stream. 
   Confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by encryption. Since 
   there is no processing of the data stream other than packetization 
   and depacketization, there is no interference to an end-to-end 
   encryption mechanism.
