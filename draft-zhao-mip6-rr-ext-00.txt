Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


1.  Motivations

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].

   MIP6 adopts Return Routability Test as a lightweight and
   infrastructure-less authentication mechanism to achieve a reasonable
   level of authentication between MN and CN even without pre-existing
   security association.  Our motivations to propose some extensions on
   the original MIP6 RR test are as follows:

   1) Location privacy (We will only focus on the location privacy in
   the IP layer in this draft.) attaches more and more attentions
   recently; Moreover, RR test could be also used to achieve the
   security of NEMO Route Optimization protocol (Although NEMO RO
   solution is still under discussion, a potential approach is to enable
   MR to register its MNP(s) with CN/CR to achieve the optimal route
   just like the procedure of Binding Updates to correspondent nodes in
   MIP6.) where the privacy issue, such as MNP (Mobile Network Prefix)
   information, becomes even more serious.  In this draft, we postpone
   the disclosure of HoA as late as possible and use the encryption to
   make HoA invisible to the eavesdropper.

   In MIP6 RR procedure, HoA is in the cleartext in the HoTi and HoT
   messages, thus an eavesdropper can learn that MN is away from the
   home network.  In every message of the extended RR test, the privacy
   of HoA is protected.  However, the location privacy of other
   messages, such as home BU messages, prefix discovery message and data
   message, is out of scope of this draft.

   2) In MIP6, an attacker that is able to only eavesdrop the traffic in
   the normal IPv6 network can effectively intercept the traffic between
   MN and CN, which makes the MIP6 network a little bit less secure than
   the normal IPv6 network.  For example, an attacker adjacent to a
   router on the path between HA and CN can only eavesdrop the traffic
   but not intercept the traffic passing by, however by eavesdropping
   and launching the RR test, the attacker can successfully intercept
   thus take the complete control over the communication between MN and
   CN.  In this draft we propose a detection mechanism for both CN and
   MN to detect any attack that could break the security of MIP6 RO
   mechanism.

   3) In MIP6, in order to mitigate the attack on the RR test, a timeout
   value is maintained.  Currently, this value is a few minutes, which
   causes a lot of overheads.  Also it is unnecessary to keep repeating
   the RR test even though there is no attacker around.  Thus how to
   reduce the signaling overhead is also our concern.  The detection

   mechanism enables CN and MN to detect such kind of ôpowerfulö
   attacker, thus take the correct responses based on the policy with
   requiring the long frequent timeout.

   4) It is also our motivation to propose a RR test mechanism that
   could be easily extended to RR-test Mobile Network Prefix in NEMO
   once NEMO working group is re-chartered to work on the RO problem.

   This draft is organized as follows: in Section 2 we briefly review
   the related works and then describe the details of our proposal in
   Section 3.  In Section 4 we present the security analysis.

2.  Related Works

   MIP6 protocol [2] adopts RR procudure to enable CN to authenticate
   the binding between CoA and HoA of MN in a reasonable level when
   there is no pre-exisitng security association between CN and MN.  The
   rationale and background of this design are documented in [5].  Later
   on, a lot of enhancements of MIP6 RO and improvement of the original
   RR procedure are proposed [6][7].  Those proposals are based on MIP6
   RO; however, NEMO RO has its own security requirements.  [8] proposed
   the idea of using NPT message to verify the correctness of MNP;
   however, it not only generates the amplication effect but also leaves
   a hole for an attacker to successfully steal the traffic, which is
   found by E.  Nordmark firstly to our best knowledgement.

3.  Assumptions

3.1  No infrastructure support

   The extended RR test does not require PKI or AAA infrastructure to
   assist the authentication procedure and thus avoids the expensive
   public key calculation and signaling overhead due to extra message
   exchanges.

3.2  Pre-existing SA between MN and HA

   We assume that there exists a security association between MN and HA
   and integrity and confidentiality of the messages between MN and HA
   are protected by this SA.

3.3  No pre-existing SA between MN and CN or between HA and CN

   We assume that there is no pre-existing SA between MN and CN or
   between HA and CN.

3.4  Ingress filtering

   Our proposal does not reply on the ingress filtering, thus we assume
   that there is no ingress filtering enforced.

3.5  HA does not have any malicious intention to CN and MN

   If HA is malicious, the security of RR procedure in MIP6 is
   comprised.  For example, a malicious HA can redirect the HoT message
   to an attacker so that the attacker can successfully finish the RR
   procedure with CN and intercept the traffic to other MN; a malicious
   HA can also drop the HoTi or HoT message from or to any MN.  In [8],
   the same assumption is also implicitly held because otherwise a
   malicious HA can forward the NPT messages to the attacker or respond
   on behalf of the attacker.  Please note that a malicious HA can break
   the communication in MIP6 and NEMO when not performing the RO
   mechanisms.  And this case falls into the category that the attacker
   has full control (interception) over the path between CN and HA.
   Thus we believe this is a valid assumption.

3.6  The assumptions of the power of the attacker

   MIP6 RR procedure limits the attack to be successful only when the
   attacker is in some certain locations.  In other words, the security
   of RR procedure is comprised when the attacker has the following
   powers: The attacker is able to access (intercept or eavesdrop) the
   message exchanges on the MN-CN path and HA-CN path.  To do so, the
   attacker could move from one path to the other; or it could have a

   conspirator on the other path; or these two paths are kind of
   overlapping with each other and the attacker is attached to the
   common part of these two paths.

   We assume that the attacker has no ability to access the message on
   both paths in a certain time period and when it attaches itself to
   either path, the attacker has at most the partial control over the
   path to eavesdrop the traffic passing by.

4.  Proposal

   Our discussions are based on the following simplified MIP6 scenario:
   CN is a fixed node in the Internet.  It is possible to use the
   reverse tunneling when CN is also a mobile node just like in [5], but
   we will address this case in details in the later version of this
   draft due to the constrained time frame.

4.1  Notations

   Besides those used in [2], we also defines the following notations:

   RN: a random number generated and managed by MN with the fixed
   length.  In other words, the length of RN is pre-configured and well
   known by MN, HA, CN and/or any other node.

   HV: the output of a secure hash function, such as SHA1.

4.2  The basic RR procedure

   When MN moves to a new location other than its home network, MN may
   decide to launch the RR procedure with remote node, CN, based on its
   policy that is not within the scope of this draft.

   HoTi:

      Source IP address: HoA

      Destination IP address: CN

      {home_init_cookie | RN}

   MN generates the HoTi message and forwards it into the reverse MN-HA
   tunnel, thus the confidentiality and secrecy of HoTi are protected by
   SA between MN and HA.

   After HA receives the HoTi message, HA can verify that HoA belongs to
   this home network.  When the verification is successful, HA will
   generate the following HoTi_HA message and forward it to CN.  Note
   that HoTi_HA message can use the same MH type value for HoTi message
   because all these messages are transparent to CN.  We give the
   different names to these two messages in order to highlight their
   differences.

   HoTi_HA:

      Source IP address: HA

Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


      Destination IP address: CN

      {home_init_ha_cookie | HV} where HV = SHA1 (HoA | RN)

   Please note that HA replaces the source IP address, HoA, with its own
   IP address, HA and replaces home_init_cookie with
   home_init_ha_cookie.  home_init_ha_cookie can be generated by
   AES(Kha, HoA | home_init_cookie) or at random and HA establishes a
   table storing home_init_ha_cookie, HoA and home_init_cookie in one
   entry where home_init_ha_cookie is a primary key.  Please note that
   HA generates home_init_ha_cookie by encrypting the concatenation of
   HoA and home_init_cookie after it verifies the received packet, it
   does not risk the Denial-of-Service attack at this stage and saves
   the memory cost.  However, it may become a serious threat when HA
   later decrypts the message to restore HoA and home_init_cookie even
   though HA may verify the home_init_ha_cookie firstly, so HA can avoid
   the DoS attack at the cost of memory.

   After CN receives HoTi_HA message, CN generates the HoT message.
   Note that the formula to generate home_token takes HV as input as
   well.

   HoT:

      Source IP address: CN

      Destination IP address: HA

      {home_init_ha_cookie | home_token | home_nonce_index}

      home_token = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kcn, (HV | home_nonce | 0)))

   After HA receives HoT message, HA looks up the table with
   home_init_ha_cookie as the primary key or decrypts the
   home_init_ha_cookie.  After successfully achieving HoA and
   home_init_cookie, HA generates the following HoT_HA message and
   forwards it to MN.

   HoT_HA:

      Source IP address: CN

      Destination IP address: HoA

      {home_init_cookie | home_token | home_nonce_index}

      home_token = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kcn, (HV | home_nonce | 0)))

Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


   Please note that HoT_HA message can use the same MH type value for
   HoT message because all these messages are transparent to MN.  We
   give the different names to these two messages in order to highlight
   their differences.

   MN generates the CoTi message and sends it directly to CN.  Note that
   CoTi carries HV instead of HoA in the cleartext.

   CoTi:

      Source IP address: CoA

      Destination IP address: CN

      {careof_init_cookie | HV}

      HV = SHA1 (HoA | RN)

      where RN is the same random number used in the HoTi.

   After CN receives CoTi message, CN generates the CoT message.  Note
   that the formula to generate careof_token takes HV as input as well.

   CoT:

      Source IP address: CN

      Destination IP address: CoA

      {careof_init_cookie | careof_token | careof_nonce_index}

      careof_token = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kcn, (CoA | HV | careof_nonce
      | 1)))

   The binding management key, Kbm, is generated by taking the
   concatenation of home_token and careof_token as input of SHA1.

   Kbm = SHA1(home_token | careof_token)

   MN generates the BU message as follows and sends it to CN.

   BU:

      Source IP address: CoA

      Destination IP address: CN

Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


      {HoA | Seq | home_nonce_index | careof_nonce_index | RN | HC |
      MAC}

      MAC = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kbm, (CoA | CN | BU)))

   When CN receives the BU message, CN firstly calculates HV based on
   HoA and RN, then generates Kbm and verifies the MAC, finally verifies
   the element in the hash chain.  If MN requests the Binding
   Acknowledgement, CN generates the BA message based on the
   verification result.

   BA:

      Source IP address: CN

      Destination IP address: CoA

      {Seq | HV | MAC}

      MAC = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kbm, (CoA | CN | BA)))

4.3  Protection of the HoA privacy in the BU message

   Kbm = SHA1(home_token | careof_token | 0)

   Ken = SHA1(home_token | careof_token | 1)

   BU:

      Source IP address: CoA

      Destination IP address: CN

      {Seq | home_nonce_index | careof_nonce_index | HV | ENC | MAC}

      ENC = AES (Ken, HoA | RN)

      MAC = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kbm, (CoA | CN | BU)))

   BA:

      Source IP address: CN

      Destination IP address: CoA

      {Seq | HV | MAC}

Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


      MAC = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kbm, (CoA | CN | BA)))

   Please note that the decryption operation is after the verification
   succeeds, which is necessary to reduce the risk of Denial-of-Service
   attack.  However, an attacker on the HA-CN path can still pass the
   MAC verification and make CN spend resources on the decryption
   operation.  However, this attack cannot be stopped.  So if this is
   really a concern for CN, the encryption is better not available.

4.4  Extending the RR test with a detection mechanism

   The original MIP6 RR procedure allows an attacker to intercept the
   traffic even though this attacker is only able to eavesdrop the
   traffic, which makes MIP6 slightly less secure than the normal IPv4
   Internet today.  In order to address this vulnerability together with
   other benefits we describe before, we propose a simple but effective
   detection mechanism to enable CN to detect and then take the correct
   action when the power of attacker can succeed in the original RR
   procedure.  The core idea is that either an attacker or a valid MN
   must provide the cryptographically sound proof of the previous
   successful Binding Update at CN if any before a new Binding Update
   being accepted by CN.  If the correctness of this proof cannot be
   verified by CN, CN will disable the relevant Binding Update Cache
   entry and switch from MIP6 RO mode to MIP6 Basic mode.

   We adopt the concept of one-way hash chain to achieve this.  Although
   there are a lot of different kinds of one-way hash chain, we use the
   following one:

   MN wants to a chain of length l.  Firstly, it generates a random
   number h_l and then repeatedly applies the one-way hash function, F.
   For example, h_l-1=F(h_l), h_l-2=F(h_l-1), à, h_0=F(h_1).  This
   one-way hash chain has the following properties: 1) MN reveals the
   elements of the chain in the order of h_0, h_1, à, h_l to CN.  Even
   though the attacker acquires h_i in this chain correctly, it is still
   cryptographically impossible for him to derive h_j from h_i where
   j>i.  On the contrary, any one can easily confirm that h_j is part of
   the chain if h_i=F(h_j)^(j-i) where j>i.  2) MN can create the chain
   all at once and store each element of the chain, or just store h_l
   together with the sequence number of the next element in the chain
   and generate the element on demand.  In practice, other approach can
   help to reduce storage cost with a small recomputation penalty.  (It
   is possible to use log(l) storage and log(l) computation to access an
   element).  Also we expect that the development of technology will
   meet the increasing requirement of battery and memory for MN to
   maintain such kind of one-way hash chain.

   HC denotes the current element in the one-way hash chain and Seq



Zhao, et al.             Expires August 18, 2005               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


   denotes the sequence number of this element in the one-way hash
   chain.

   MN generates the BU message as follows and sends it to CN.

   BU:

      Source IP address: CoA

      Destination IP address: CN

      {HoA | Seq | home_nonce_index | careof_nonce_index | RN | HC |
      MAC}

      MAC = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kbm, (CoA | CN | BU)))

   When CN receives the BU message, CN firstly calculates HV based on
   HoA and RN, then generates Kbm and finally verifies the MAC.  If the
   verification is successful, CN performs the following procedure:

   Search the Binding Update Cache by using MNÆs HoA as the primary key.

   If it does exist, CN verifies the HC in the BU message with the old
   element stored in the Binding Updates Cache.

   If it succeeds, CN believes this BU message is correct and then sends
   the Binding Acknowledgement message if requested.

   If it fails, CN realizes that there is an attacker that can
   successfully finish the extended RR test; however, CN is not sure
   whether this BU message is from the attacker or a valid MN based on
   its current knowledge.  Thus CN disables this entry until it times
   out, indicates the reason in the BA message and forwards the data
   packets destined to this HoA based on MIP6 Basic mode rather than
   MIP6 RO mode.

   If it does not exist, CN accepts the BU message and creates a new
   Binding Update Cache Entry and forwards the data packets destined to
   this HoA based on MIP6 RO protocol.

   CN also has to take into consideration the case that MN fails or
   reboots and all the information related to HC is lost.  In this case,
   CN has to wait until the related BCE expires before accepting the new
   BU message.

   If MN requests the Binding Acknowledgement, CN generates the BA
   message based on the verification result.

   BA:

      Source IP address: CN

4.5  Non-repudiation

   In this session, we discuss about the non-repudiation issue.  It
   seems that the only way to achieve the non-repudiation of HA or CN is
   to use the public key.  Our extended RR test can be extended to
   achieve the repudiation when the public keys of HA or CN are
   available.  The details of this extension are skipped because it is
   equivalent to say that there exists the trust relationship between HA
   and CN.  However, by using hash chain rather than public key, it does
   reduce the computation cost.

5.  Security consideration

   We take the following special considerations when extending the RR
   test:

5.1  The privacy of HoA is protected as much as possible

   All other messages use the hash value of HoA instead of HoA in the
   cleartext, which not only makes the attacker learn the HoA
   information cryptographically impossible, but also help shorten the
   length of message, simplify the task to design and parse message
   format as the length of a hash function output is fixed.  Moreover,
   we append a random number to HoA before performing the hash function
   in order to make it more difficulty for the attacker to derive the
   HoA information.

   Please note that the privacy issue is secondary compared with the
   authentication because if an attacker can break the authentication of
   the RR test, the privacy of HoA cannot be kept.  (If the process of
   encryption/decryption is much more expensive, the attacker can launch
   the Denial-of-Service attack to CN.)

5.2  The disclosure of HoA is postponed as late as possible

   Even though the BU message leaks the HoA information, the attacker on
   the MN-CN path together with its conspirator on the HA-CN path cannot
   launch the redirection attack to intercept the traffic that is
   intended to a specific MN if the attackers are assumed to be able to
   eavesdrop the traffic only and the detection mechanism is in use.

5.3  Supports the fast Binding Updates procedure

   The extended RR test supports the fast Binding Updates procedure in
   CN, which is especially useful when MN moves from one location to
   another frequently.  When MN moves to a new location, MN can reuse
   the home_token received at the previous location as long as
   home_token is still valid, thus MN saves the home test procedure that
   is usually longer than the careof test since HoTi and HoT messages go
   through HA firstly.

   Please note that the attacks described in [7] do not succeed in our
   RR test.  For the session hijacking attacks in section 3.1, although
   the attacker can learn the home_token, however, it does not know the
   HoA information, so the attacker cannot generate the correct BU
   message.  If the attacker has its conspirator on the MN-CN path,
   since its conspirator cannot intercept the message, it cannot stop MN
   from finishing the Binding Updates procedure at CN.  Together with
   the detection mechanism, the traffic cannot be hijacked.  For the

   Movement Halting attacks in section 3.2, when the attacker is able to
   know home_token and careof_token in the different sessions but from
   one single MN, the attacker must have to learn the HoA from the BU
   message.  If the BU message is encrypted, the attack fails if the
   attacker cannot monitor both paths simultaneously.  If the BU message
   is not encrypted, the attack still fails when the detection mechanism
   is used.  For the traffic permutation attacks in section 3.3, the
   attacker is able to know multiple home_tokens and multiple
   careof_tokens in the different sessions from multiple different MNs.
   However, since both home_token and careof_token are generated from
   the hash output of the HoA information, CN can detect the forged BU
   message using mixed home_token and careof_token.  Again the detection
   mechanism can detect this attack as well.

   Our RR test only prevents the attack target at a specific MN and the
   attacker has no knowledge of the HoA information associated with this
   MN.  But the attacker on the HA-CN path is free to launch the RR
   procedure for any HoA it chooses.  Again, this attack can be
   mitigated by the detection mechanism.

6.  Conclusions

   In this draft, we propose several extensions to the MIP6 RR test.
   Our proposal protects the privacy of HoA and provides a prompt method
   for CN to detect the attack accurately when the attacker could
   succeed in the original MIP6 RR procedure.
