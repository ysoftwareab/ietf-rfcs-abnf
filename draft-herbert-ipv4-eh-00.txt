1  Introduction

   This specification defines extension headers for IPv4 as well as an
   IPv4 flow label. The motivation is to provide an extensible mechanism
   in IPv4 that is unified with IPv6 and thus facilitates leveraging
   common protocol and implementation for extensibility between the two
   versions of the Internet Protocol.

   The extension headers defined for IPv6 in [RFC8200], specifically
   Hop-by-Hop Options, Destination Options, Routing Header, and Fragment
   Header are permitted for use with IPv4 (note that Authentication
   Header and Encapsulating Security Payload are already usable with
   IPv4). Additionally, No Next Header (protocol number 59) is defined
   to be usable in IPv4 packets.

   The IPv4 flow label is similarly derived from the definition of the
   IPv6 flow label. There is no flow label defined in the IPv4 header
   [RFC791], however under specific circumstances the sixteen bit
   Identification field may safely be used as a flow label.

1.1 Motivation

   IPv6 is intended to become the standard protocol of the Internet,
   however it is clear that there is a large segment of users that will
   be using IPv4 for the foreseeable future. This is particularly true
   in many enterprises where a business case for transitioning to IPv6
   hasn't yet emerged [V6STATE].

   In lieu of sun-setting IPv4 and expecting all users to move to IPv6
   in some time frame that is unlikely to be met, this specification
   suggests an alternative which is to improve IPv4. However the nature
   of these improvements is very specific, the idea is to "backport"
   useful features of IPv6 into IPv4. Essentially, this makes IPv4 look
   more like IPv6. The rationale for this is two fold:

      1) Users benefit from forward looking features being actively
         defined and developed for IPv6 without requiring them to
         transition to IPv6.

      2) In making IPv4 look more like IPv6, the work required to
         complete a future transition to IPv6 at some site may be
         reduced or simplified.

   Various proposals that would use IPv6 extensions are currently being
   discussed in IETF. These include Segment Routing [SRV6], Compressed
   Routing Header [CRH], Path MTU Option [MTUOPT], In-situ OAM [IOAM],
   Service-aware IPv6 Network [SAIN], and Firewall and Service Tickets
   [FAST]. These proposals leverage the extensibility mechanism of

INTERNET DRAFT          draft-herbert-ipv4-eh-00           April 8, 2019


   extension headers defined for IPv6. All of these proposals, in some
   form, could be of value for use with IPv4. Unfortunately, IPv4 does
   not have an extensibility mechanism that meets the requirements for
   supporting them. IP options are quite limited and have long been
   considered obsolete. There have been proposal for encoding host to
   network signaling in UDP (e.g. [SPUD], IOAM over encapsulation like
   Geneve [IOAMGEN]), however these are shown to neither be generic nor
   robust especially in the case that encapsulated data must be modified
   in flight.

   The proposal contained in this document is to enable IPv4 packets to
   carry the extension headers in the same manner that IPv6 packets can
   carry extension headers. In doing so, the various extensions for IPv6
   can be used with IPv4 to the benefit of the user. In many cases (such
   as IOAM and Path MTU option), the extension being defined is protocol
   agnostic and would be applicable and usable with IPv4 with little or
   no change. In other cases, such as segment routing, the extension
   being defined might be IPv6 specific, for example the segment routing
   header contains a list of IPv6 addresses. With some modification to
   the extension definition, it is also conceivable that these may work
   with IPv4. For instance, in the case of segment routing the extension
   can be adapted for use with IPv4 by defining a routing header format
   that contains IPv4 addresses instead of IPv6 addresses.

1.2 IPv4 extension headers

   IPv4 options were defined in [RFC0791] as the means of extending the
   IP protocol. IPv4 options have not been successful. Early router
   implementations, and even those today, either don't process IPv4
   options or relegate them to a slow path effectively making them
   unusable for serious applications. IPv4 options are limited to forty
   bytes length and, unlike TCP options, no IP options have been defined
   that are critical to communications. The upshot is that IPv4 options
   have long not been considered an option for deployment [IPNOOP].

   IPv6 took a different approach. Extensibility of IPv6 is provided by
   extension headers. Optional internet-layer information is encoded in
   separate headers that may be placed between the IPv6 header and the
   upper-layer header in a packet [RFC8200]. IPv6 extension headers have
   had mixed success in deployment in that some intermediate devices
   have trouble processing them [RFC7872], however there are several
   active proposals in IETF that would make use of them (e.g. [FAST],
   [MTUOPT], [IOAM], [SRV6EH]).

   Using extension headers with IPv4 is logically straightforward. The
   IPv4 Protocol field is effectively re-designated to be a Next Header
   field with the same meaning and semantics as the IPv6 Next Header
   field. In this manner, an IPv4 packet can contain IPv6 extension

INTERNET DRAFT          draft-herbert-ipv4-eh-00           April 8, 2019


   headers that are recast as IPv4 extension headers. These include Hop-
   by-Hop Options, Routing Header, Fragment, Destination Options,
   Authentication, and Encapsulating Security Payload. In cases where an
   extension header contains IPv6 specific information, the extension
   header can be adapted for use with IPv4. For instance, a Routing
   Header carrying IPv6 addresses to visit could be adapted to carry
   IPv4 addresses.

1.3 The IPv4 flow label

   IPv6 [RFC8200] introduced the concept of a flow label that has proven
   quite convenient to perform flow classification, such as that needed
   by Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP). The base IPv4 header does not have
   reserved bits that could be allocated as a flow label, however the
   sixteen bit Identification field can be used as a flow label in
   atomic datagrams [RFC6864].

   The IPv4 flow label will be most useful in scenarios for which the
   existing mechanisms used to classify IPv4 packets, such as parsing
   transport layer headers to extract port information, aren't
   available. Defining an IPv4 flow label is another instance of back
   porting a beneficial feature from IPv6 and further unifying the two
   protocols.

2  IPv4 extension headers

   IPv4 extension headers are optional internet-layer information
   encoded in separate headers that may be placed between the IPv4
   header and the upper-layer header in a packet. IPv4 extension headers
   are based on IPv6 extension headers and share the same basic
   properties and semantics [RFC8200].

   Extension headers are numbered from IANA IP Protocol Numbers [IANA-
   PN], the same values are used for IPv4 and IPv6. When processing a
   sequence of Next Header values in a packet, the first one that is not
   an extension header [IANA-EH] indicates that the next item in the
   packet is the corresponding upper-layer header. A special "No Next
   Header" value is used if there is no upper-layer header.

   As illustrated in these examples, an IPv4 packet MAY carry zero, one,
   or more extension headers, each identified by Protocol field of the
   IPv4 header or the Next Header field of a preceding extension header:

2.1 Requirements

2.1.1 General requirements

   IPv4 extension headers normatively assume the requirements of IPv6
   extension headers as defined in [RFC8200] section 4, with the
   following modifications:

      * References to the IPv6 header are replaced by references to the
        IPv4 header.

      * ICMP errors sent in the course of processing extension headers
        use ICMPv4 instead of ICMPv6.

      * The IPv4 header Protocol field assumes the same role and
        semantics with respect to extension headers as the IPv6 Next
        Header field.

      * The Hop-by-Hop Options header is used to carry optional
        information that MAY be examined and processed by any node along
        a packet's delivery path.

      * If a legacy IPv4 destination node, one that does not support
        IPv4 extension headers, receives a packet with extension headers
        then the packet will be processed as having an unknown protocol.
        It is expected that the packet will be discarded and an ICMP
        error may be generated.

INTERNET DRAFT          draft-herbert-ipv4-eh-00           April 8, 2019


      * Extension headers or options that carry IPv6 specific data or
        are otherwise specific to IPv6 MUST NOT be used with IPv4
        (Segment Routing [SRV6EH] for example). IPv4 variants of these
        might be defined if achieving the same functionality in IPv4 is
        desirable.

      * References to the Payload Length, for instance in reassembly
        procedures, are reinterpreted as being the computed IPv4 payload
        length (i.e. IPv4 Total Length minus the length of the IPv4
        header).

2.1.2 Fragmentation and reassembly requirements

   The following are modifications to fragmentation and reassembly
   requirements:

      * References to setting the Payload Length field in the IPv6
        header are interpreted to be setting the Total Length in the
        IPv4 header taking into account the IPv4 header length.

      * When creating or modifying IPv4 headers in packets, the IPv4
        header checksum MUST be set correctly.

      * Different fragment packets MAY contain different IPv4 options.
        In the reassembled packet, the IP options are taken from the
        first fragment packet (the one with offset of zero).

      * Different fragment packets MAY contain different extension
        headers preceding the fragment header. In the reassembled
        packet, the extension headers preceding the fragment header are
        taken from the first fragment packet (the one with offset of
        zero).

      * If the length and offset of a fragment are such that the Total
        Length of the packet reassembled from that fragment would exceed
        65,535 octets, then that fragment must be discarded and an ICMP
        Parameter Problem, Code 0, message should be sent to the source
        of the fragment, pointing to the Fragment Offset field of the
        fragment packet.

2.2 Interaction with standard IPv4 mechanisms

   IPv4 extension headers may be used concurrently with IPv4 mechanisms
   such as IPv4 options and IPv4 fragmentation. This section discusses
   the interactions.

2.2.1 IPv4 options and IPv4 extension headers

   An IPv4 packet MAY contain both IPv4 options and extension headers.
   IPv4 options are completely independent of IPv4 extension headers.
   IPv4 options MUST be processed before processing any extension
   headers per normal requirements of processing the IP header before
   the IP payload.

2.2.2 IPv4 fragmentation and IPv4 extension headers

   An IPv4 packet MAY be fragmented both by using a Fragment extension
   header as well as by standard IPv4 fragmentation. The Fragment header
   can only be set at the source, however intermediate devices can
   fragment packets using standard IPv4 fragmentation. Standard IPv4
   fragmentation at a source node MUST be done only after any extension
   headers are set in a packet or the packet was fragmented using the
   Fragment header. Specifically, fragmentation using the extension
   header MUST NOT be done on packet fragments created by standard IPv4
   fragmentation. However, a packet fragment that contains a Fragment
   header MAY itself be fragmented by standard IPv4 fragmentation. There
   is no correlation between normal IPv4 fragmentation and the IPv4
   Fragment header, the identifier space for each are unrelated and
   reassembly procedures are independent.

   At a destination, if a received packet was fragmented by standard
   IPv4 fragmentation, it MUST be reassembled before processing any IPv4
   extension headers. This requirement ensures that standard IPv4
   reassembly is done before reassembly for the Fragment header.

   If an IPv4 packet containing Hop-by-Hop options is fragmented using
   standard IPv4 fragmentation, the Hop-by-Hop Options are not set in
   each of the packet fragments. An intermediate node MAY process the
   Hop-by-Hop options in the first fragment if the complete Hop-by-Hop
   extension header is contained within the fragment. If the Fragment
   header is used with IPv4 then the DF bit (Don't Fragment) bit SHOULD
   be set and Path MTU discovery mechanisms SHOULD be used.

2.2.3 Atomic datagram recommendation

   It is RECOMMENDED to only use IPv4 extensions in atomic datagrams.
   Atomic datagrams [RFC6834] are IPv4 packets for which the Don't
   Fragment bit set, More Fragment bit is not set, and Fragment Offset
   is zero. In this case the packet will not be subject to IPv4
   fragmentation, the Fragment header can alternatively be used for
   fragmentation.

3  The IPv4 flow label

   The Identification field of the IPv4 header is re-purposed to be the
   IPv4 flow label in atomic datagrams. As stated in [RFC6864]:

     ">> Originating sources MAY set the IPv4 ID field of atomic
      datagrams to any value."

   This specification allows the IPv4 ID to be used as a flow label in
   atomic datagrams where (DF==1)&&(MF==0)&&(frag_offset==0).

3.1 Sender requirements

   An origin host MAY set the IPv4 Identification field as a flow label
   in atomic datagram packets. The IPv4 flow label is set following the
   same procedures for setting the IPv6 flow label as described in
   [RFC6437], with the following modifications:

      * The Identification field MUST only be used as a flow label in
        atomic datagrams. That is Don't Fragment (DF) bit MUST be set,
        More Fragment (MF) bit MUST NOT be set, and Fragment Offset MUST
        be zero.

      * If the IPv4 Identification field is not used as a flow label in
        atomic fragments, the Identification field MUST be set to zero.

      * Only stateless flow labels can be set.

      * The value to set, e.g. from a hash computation over packet
        headers, is truncated to sixteen bits (the size of the
        Identification field).

      * Intermediate nodes MUST NOT set the Identification field in
        atomic datagrams.


3.2 Receiver requirements

   Receivers, including intermediate hosts, MAY process a non-zero
   Identification field in the IPv4 header of atomic datagrams as being
   a flow label. The IPv4 flow label for instance can be used as input
   to ECMP as described in [RFC6438].

   If the Identification field is zero or the packet is not an atomic
   datagram (either the More Fragment bit is set, the Don't Fragment bit
   is not set, or Fragment Offset is non-zero) then the Identification
   field MUST NOT be considered as a flow label.

4  Deployability

   If a legacy host device receives an IPv4 packet with IPv4 extension
   headers, the packet will be treated as having an unknown protocol and
   should dropped. Intermediate devices might also see packets with a
   protocol unknown to them and will forward the packet inasmuch as they
   would forward any packet with an unknown protocol.

   In the  Internet, it is well known that there are some intermediate
   nodes that will drop packets with protocols that are unknown to them
   (firewalls would commonly to this for instance). Therefore, it is
   unlikely that packets with IPv4 extension headers can be ubiquitously
   deployed over the Internet. A workaround to this might be to
   encapsulate extension headers in UDP [EHUDPENCAP].

   In a limited domain [LIMDOM], an operator would have control over
   intermediate nodes and could ensure that at a minimum they properly
   forward packets with IPv4 extension headers. Routers in a limited
   domain can be updated to process IPv4 Hop-by-Hop Options or Routing
   headers to provide the functionality of features like IOAM and
   Segment Routing in IPv4. Similarly, they could be updated to support
   the IPv4 flow label to provide flow based ECMP in the same manner
   that the IPv6 flow label is used for ECMP [RFC6438].

5  Security Considerations

   This specification enables use of IPv6 extension headers in IPv4.
   Related security mechanisms of IPv6 extension headers can be applied
   for use with IPv4 extension headers.

   The IPv4 flow label has similar security properties as the IPv6 flow
   label. If the security intent of the sender is to prevent
   intermediate nodes in the network from classifying its traffic into
   flows then the IPv4 flow label SHOULD NOT be used.

6  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to change the descriptions of IPv6 extension
   headers and No Next Header protocol numbers to reflect that they are
   not IPv4 specific.

   In the Assigned Internet Protocol Numbers Registry, the modified
   protocols descriptions are:

   IANA is requested to update "Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4)
   Parameters" to include sections for "IPv6 Extension Header Types",
   "Destination Options and "Hop-by-Hop Options", and "Routing Types".
   These are based on the similarly named sections in "Internet Protocol
   Version 6 (IPv6) Parameters" with appropriate modifications for IPv4.
