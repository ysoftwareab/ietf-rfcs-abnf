INTERNET DRAFT        IP Address Management in DMM      October 27, 2014


1  Introduction

   In DMM scenario, mobility anchors would be deployed in a distributed
   manner, and as specified in RFC7333 [RFC7333], one of the aims of DMM
   is to reduce the routing redundancy between mobile node and
   correspondent node, which means providing a more optimal
   communication path for application traffic between mobile node and
   correspondent node. To achieve routing optimization for specific
   application traffic, the basic idea is to make the traffic using IP
   address(s) anchored at current anchor, so that downlink traffic from
   correspondent node to mobile node will go directly to mobile node,
   but this routing optimization requirement brings a fact that mobile
   node has to change its IP address as it moving to a new anchor. Some
   application sessions can cope with the change of IP address either by
   application layer itself or by the function provided by other layers,
   e.g. transport layer; but for other application sessions, after IP
   address changed, the application session would be broken off totally.
   So it's reasonable to provide different network layer mobility
   support according to the need of application. This document provides
   a discussion on IP address management in DMM domain, which gives
   support to source IP address selection on mobile node side. A brief
   discussion of how end host chooses to use the IP address provided by
   network is also involved. Currently, the address management described
   in this document is not specific to certain DMM framework.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2 IP Address Management

2.1 All application sessions prefer IP address consistency


   In IP network, the nature of IP address acting as both "locator" and
   "identifier" results that the change of "location" would inevitably
   interrupt continuity of ongoing application session, no matter short-
   lived or long last one. There are mainly two different technical
   routes to eliminate the impacts of IP address change on application
   session continuity, the first one is keeping IP address unchanged
   during movement of host; the second one is allowing IP address change
   to happen and then using other methods to make the application
   session correctly finished, here are some examples of these methods:

   (1) Deal with IP address change in process of a session Mobility

INTERNET DRAFT        IP Address Management in DMM      October 27, 2014


   support could be provided by application layer or transport layer.
   When IP address change happens, specific signaling of application
   layer or transport layer could be used to add new IP address to the
   session and at the same time removing old IP address from the
   session.

   (2) Restart a new session If there is no specific application layer
   signaling to deal with the change of IP address, the application
   could choose to restart a session when it finds the previous session
   failed. This method would only be used for short-lived session, e.g.
   DNS query/response session. Although, as discussed above, there are
   methods to cope with IP address change for application session, but
   from application's perspective, all these methods will bring in
   certain amount of "cost", and may import other negative impacts, e.g.
   signaling latency, packet losing, TCP slow start etc, in order to
   deal with the impact of IP address change. So we have to say that,
   all application sessions prefer to not change their IP address, the
   reason why they provide mechanisms to deal with IP address change is
   they have to do that, but not they willing to do that.  

   Another issue is that if application wants to make their traffic pass
   through an optimal path between MN and CN, it has to use an IP
   address anchored on the optimal path. So in order to get an overall
   good performance for application, there should be a tradeoff on
   whether to use a new IP address or not. 

2.2  Address Management model

   This sub-section provides a detailed description of suggested address
   management model to satisfy the requirement of analysis result in
   sub-section 2.1.

2.2.1 Design Principles

   The following are some design principles considered in design process
   of the address management model:

   P1. Network SHOULD provide IP address consistency during the whole
   session lifetime for application that cannot bear IP address change.

   P2. Providing opportunity for application session to use the new IP
   address after mobile node handover to a new anchor, but in order to
   limit IP address change frequency, application session SHOULD NOT
   changes its IP address each time after handover to a new anchor.

   P3. Less IP addresses maintained by mobile node is preferred.

   P4. Less requirements on mobile node side is preferred.

2.2.2 Anchor Deployment

   Anchors are deployed in a distributed manner, and each one could
   assign its own prefix to mobile node.

   Home anchor: A prefix's home anchor refers to the anchor which the
   prefix belongs to.

   Foreign anchor: A prefix's foreign anchor refers to all of the other
   anchors that are not home anchor.

   Current anchor: The anchor that mobile node currently attaches to.

2.2.3 Prefix Category

   There are two kinds of prefixes: stable prefix and temporary prefix.
   DMM network will provide mobility support for both of these two kinds
   of prefix.

   Stable prefix: Assigned by its home anchor, when mobile node hands
   over to a foreign anchor the stable prefix will be maintained by
   foreign anchors as long as the prefix is still being used by
   application.

   Temporary prefix: Assigned by its home anchor, temporary prefix
   usually has different valid lifetime values in home anchor's network
   and in foreign anchor's network (more shorter in foreign anchor's
   network), a foreign anchor only provide mobility support for
   temporary prefix for a specific period of time after which the
   temporary prefix will become invalid. In DMM domain, the anchors
   could set the valid lifetime of other anchors' temporary prefix to a
   predefined value.

   Each anchor maintains at least one stable prefix and one temporary
   prefix for mobile node.

2.2.4 Anchor Action

   Anchor advertises its own stable prefix and temporary prefix to the
   mobile node, and sets them as preferred prefix. If mobile node is
   hands over to current anchor from a previous anchor if prefix(es) of
   previous anchor is still used by application session of mobile node,
   then the current anchor will also advertise these prefixes from
   previous anchor, but set them as deprecated prefix. Current anchor
   sets valid lifetime value of temporary prefix of previous anchor to a
   specific value after which the prefix becomes invalid. When the cost
   of using previous temporary prefix is beyond a certain threshold
   (e.g. current anchor is certain hops away from home anchor), current

   anchor could choose not advertise the temporary prefix to mobile
   node, and this will let the application session to select a new
   prefix to reduce routing redundancy.

2.2.5 IP Address Release

   To reduce the number of IP addresses that mobile node must maintains,
   and contexts that network maintains for mobile node, there should be
   an effective IP address release mechanism for mobile node. 

   Triggers that could cause IP address to be released:

   (1) Prefix valid Lifetime expiration.

   (2) No traffic is transported using the IP address. For example, when
   mobile node hands over to a new anchor, if there is no traffic
   transported on previous anchors' prefixes, the prefixes will be seen
   as invalid in current anchor's network. But there should be a special
   treatment for MN's public address which can be retrieved by others
   through DNS (e.g. when MN is a mobile server) , public address is a
   kind of stable address though current anchor could set it as a
   deprecated address, but it should not be released even when there is
   not traffic using it.

   (3) Mobile node explicitly signals out that it wants to release
   certain IP address.

3 Source Address selection

   Which IP address could be selected as source address depends on what
   IP addresses are provided by network. Based on the address management
   model discussed in this document, there are some simple source
   address selection criteria:

   (1) New communication (e.g., the opening of a new TCP connection)
   should use a preferred address when possible.  

   (2) If an existing app session could cope with IP address changes, it
   could choose to use temporary address from temporary prefix. In a
   visit network, when MN's previous temporary address becomes invalid,
   a new temporary address from  current anchor's temporary prefix will
   be selected.

   (3) A deprecated stable address should be used only by applications
   that have been using it and would have difficulty switching to
   another address without a service disruption.

   (4) For the session which is initialized by CN, the address in the

   destination address field of packet from CN will be used as source
   address of outgoing packets. (This is mainly for the case of using
   MN's public address)
