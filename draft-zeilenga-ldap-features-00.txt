1. Overview

  LDAP [RFC2251] is an extensible protocol with numerous elective
  features.  LDAP provides specific mechanisms for a client to discover
  supported protocol versions, control, extended operations, and SASL
  mechanisms.  However, these mechanisms are not designed to support
  general feature discovery.  This document details a simple supported
  feature discovery mechanism.

  The key words ``MUST'', ``MUST NOT'', ``REQUIRED'', ``SHALL'', ``SHALL
  NOT'', ``SHOULD'', ``SHOULD NOT'', ``RECOMMENDED'',  and ``MAY'' in
  this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
  [RFC2119].


2. Discovery of supported features

  This document describes a simple, general-purpose mechanism which
  clients may use to discovery the set of features supported by a
  server.

  Each feature whose support may be discovered SHALL be identified by an
  Object Identifier (OID).  A server advertises its support for a given
  feature by providng the Object Identifier associated with the feature
  as a value of the supportedFeatures attribute held in the root DSE.  A
  client may examine the values of this attribute to determine if a
  particular feature is supported by the server.

  The supportedFeatures attribute type is described [RFC2252] as
  follows:

       ( OID.TBD NAME 'supportedFeatures'
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38
         USAGE dSAOperation )


3. Security Considerations

  As features of a server may be discovered by other means (such as
  trial and error) by rogue clients; this feature discovery mechanism is
  not believed to introduce any new security risk to LDAP.


4. Acknowledgment

  This document is based upon input from the IETF LDAPext working group.
