Introduction</h3>

<p>The Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) Working Group was formed in
      November 2001 to develop an Internet signaling protocol suite that would
      attempt to remedy some of the perceived shortcomings of solutions based
      on the Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP), e.g., with respect to
      mobility and Quality of Service (QoS) interoperability. The initial
      charter was focused on QoS signaling as the first use case, taking as
      the background for the work RSVP. In May 2003, middlebox traversal was
      added as an explicit second use case. The requirements for the new
      generation of signaling protocols are documented in <a class='info' href='#RFC3726'>[RFC3726]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Brunner, M., &ldquo;Requirements for Signaling Protocols,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a> and an analysis of existing signaling protocols
      can be found in <a class='info' href='#RFC4094'>[RFC4094]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Manner, J. and X. Fu, &ldquo;Analysis of Existing Quality-of-Service Signaling Protocols,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The design of NSIS is based on a two-layer model, where a general
      signaling transport layer provides services to an upper signaling
      application layer. The design was influenced by Bob Braden's Internet
      Draft entitled "A Two-Level Architecture for Internet Signaling" <a class='info' href='#I-D.braden-2level-signal-arch'>[I&#8209;D.braden&#8209;2level&#8209;signal&#8209;arch]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, R. and B. Lindell, &ldquo;A Two-Level Architecture for Internet Signaling,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2002.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>This document gives an overview of the NSIS framework and protocol
      suite is at the time of writing (2009), providing an introduction to the
      use cases for which the current version of NSIS was designed, notes on
      how to deploy NSIS in existing networks and summarizing how the protocol
      suite can be enhanced to satisfy new use cases.

<a name="rfc.section.2"></a><h3>2.&nbsp;
The NSIS Architecture</h3>

<p>The design of the NSIS protocol suite reuses ideas and concepts from
      RSVP but essentially divides the functionality into two layers. The
      lower layer, the NSIS Transport Layer Protocol (NTLP), is in charge of
      transporting the higher layer protocol messages to the next signaling
      node on the path. This includes discovery of the next hop NSIS node,
      which may not be the next routing hop, and different transport and
      security services depending on the signaling application requirements.
      The General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;ntlp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and M. Stiemerling, &ldquo;GIST: General Internet Signalling Transport,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> has been developed as the protocol
      that fulfills the role of the NTLP. The NSIS protocol suite supports
      both IP protocol versions, IPv4 and IPv6.
</p>
<p>The actual signaling application logic is implemented in the higher
      layer of the NSIS stack, the NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP). While
      GIST is only concerned with transporting NSLP messages hop-by-hop
      between pairs of signaling nodes, the end-to-end signaling functionality
      is provided by the NSLP protocols if needed. Not all NSLP protocols need
      to perform end-to-end signaling. The current protocols have features to
      confine the signaling to a limited part of the path (such as the
      interior of a domain). Messages transmitted by GIST on behalf of an NSLP
      are identified by a unique NSLP identifier (NSLPID) associated with the
      NSLP. Two NSLP protocols are currently specified: one concerning Quality
      of Service signaling <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;qos&#8209;nslp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Manner, J., Karagiannis, G., and A. McDonald, &ldquo;NSLP for Quality-of-Service Signaling,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>and
      one to enable NAT/Firewall traversal <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-natfw'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;nslp&#8209;natfw]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stiemerling, M., Tschofenig, H., Aoun, C., and E. Davies, &ldquo;NAT/Firewall NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>NSIS is primarily designed to provide the signaling needed to install
      state on nodes that lie on the path that will be taken by some
      end-to-end flow of data packets; the state installed should facilitate
      or enhance some characteristic of the data flow. This is typically
      achieved by routing signaling messages along the same path (known as
      "path-coupled signaling") and intercepting the signaling message at NSIS
      capable nodes. However, the NSIS architecture is designed to be
      flexible, and the routing of signaling messages is controlled by the
      Message Routing Method (MRM) that is applied to the signaling messages.
      The initial specifications define two MRMs:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>the basic Path-Coupled MRM designed to drive signaling along the
          path that will be followed by the data flow, and
</li>
<li>an alternative Loose End MRM which is applicable for
          preconditioning the state in firewalls and Network Address
          Translation (NAT) middleboxes when data flow destinations lie behind
          this sort of middlebox. Without preconditioning these middleboxes
          will generally reject signaling messages originating outside the
          region 'protected' by the middlebox and where the destination is
          located.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Parameters carried by each signaling message drive the operation of
      the relevant transport or signaling application. In particular, the
      messages will carry Message Routing Information (MRI) that will allow
      the NSIS nodes to identify the data flow to which the signaling applies.
      Generally, the intercepted messages will be reinjected into the network
      after processing by the NSIS entities and routed further towards the
      destination, possibly being intercepted by additional NSIS capable nodes
      before arriving at the flow endpoint.
</p>
<p>As with RSVP, it is expected that the signaling message will make a
      complete round trip either along the whole end-to-end path or a part of
      it if the scope of the signaling is limited. This implements a two-phase
      strategy in which capabilities are assessed and provisional reservations
      are made on the outbound leg; these provisional reservations are then
      confirmed and operational state installed on the return leg. Unlike
      RSVP, signaling is normally initiated at the source of the data flow
      making it easier to ensure that the signaling follows the expected path
      of the data flow, but can also be receiver initiated as in RSVP.
</p>
<p>A central concept of NSIS is the Session Identifier (SID). Signaling
      application states are indexed and referred to through the SID in all
      the NSLPs. This decouples the state information from IP addresses,
      allowing dynamic IP address changes for signaling flows, e.g., due to
      mobility: changes in IP addresses do not force complete tear down and
      re-initiation of a signaling application state, merely an update of the
      state parameters in the NSLP(s), especially the MRI.
</p>
<p>At the NTLP (GIST) layer the SID is not meaningful by itself, but is
      rather used together with the NSLP identifier (NSLPID) and the Message
      Routing Information (MRI). This 3-tuple is used by GIST to index and
      manage the signaling flows. Changes of routing or dynamic IP address
      changes, e.g., due to mobility, will require GIST to modify the
      Messaging Associations (MAs) that are used to channel NSLP messages
      between adjacent GIST peers in order to satisfy the NSLP MRI for each
      SID.
</p>
<p>The following design restrictions were imposed for the first phase of
      the protocol suite. They may be lifted in future and new functionality
      may be added into the protocols at some later stage.
</p>
<p></p>

          on the signaling application request, and does not directly support
          path-decoupled signaling, e.g., QoS signaling to a bandwidth broker
          or other off-path resource manager. The framework also supports a
          "Loose-End" message routing method used to discover GIST nodes with
          particular properties in the direction of a given address, for
          example the NAT/FW NSLP uses this method to discover a NAT along the
          upstream data path.
</li>
<li>No multicast support: Introducing support for multicast was
          deemed too much overhead, considering the currently limited support
          for global IP multicast. Thus, the current GIST and the NSLP
          specifications consider unicast flows only.

The General Internet Signaling Transport</h3>

<p>The General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;ntlp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and M. Stiemerling, &ldquo;GIST: General Internet Signalling Transport,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a> provides a signaling transport and
      security services to NSIS Signaling Layer Protocols (NSLP) and the
      associated signaling applications. GIST does not define new IP transport
      protocols or security mechanisms but rather makes use of existing
      protocols, such as TCP, UDP, TLS and IPsec. Applications can indicate
      the desired transport attributes for the signaling flow, e.g.,
      unreliable or reliable, and GIST then chooses the most appropriate
      transport protocol(s) to achieve the goals of the flow. GIST will
      normally use UDP if unreliable signaling is adequate, TCP if reliability
      is required and TLS over TCP for secure (and reliable) signaling flows
      but there extensibility provisions within GIST that will allow
      alternatives to be specified in future. The GIST layered protocol stack
      is shown in <a class='info' href='#f-proto_arch'>Figure&nbsp;1<span> (</span><span class='info'>The NSIS protocol stack</span><span>)</span></a>.

<p>* The Security Support and Transport Protocol layers show
        some possible protocols that could be used to transport NSIS messages.
        To provide authentication and/or integrity protection support the
        transport protocol has to be paired with a suitable security
        mechanism, e.g., TCP with TLS or DCCP with DTLS.
</p><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" align="center"><tr><td align="center"><font face="monaco, MS Sans Serif" size="1"><b>&nbsp;Figure&nbsp;1: The NSIS protocol stack&nbsp;</b></font><br /></td></tr></table><hr class="insert" />

<p>GIST divides up the end-to-end path to be taken by the data flow into
      a number of segments between pairs of NSIS aware peer nodes located
      along the path. Not every router or other middlebox on the path needs to
      be NSIS aware: each segment of the signaling path may incorporate
      several routing hops. Also not every NSIS aware node necessarily
      implements every possible signaling application. If the signaling for a
      flow requests services from a subset of the applications, then only
      nodes that implement those services are expected to participate as
      peers, and even some of these nodes can decline to operate on a
      particular flow if, for example, the additional load might overload the
      processing capability of the node. These characteristics mean that
      incremental deployment of NSIS capabilities is possible both with the
      initial protocol suite, and for any future NSLP applications that might
      be developed. The following paragraphs describe how a signaling segment
      is setup offering the transport and security characteristics needed by a
      single NSLP.
</p>
<p>When an NSLP application wants to send a message towards a flow
      endpoint, GIST starts the process of discovering the next signaling node
      by sending a Query message towards the destination of the related data
      flow. This Query carries the NSLP identifier (NSLPID) and Message
      Routing Information (MRI) among others. The MRI contains enough
      information to control the routing of the signaling message and identify
      the associated data flow. The next GIST node on the path receives the
      message and if it is running the same NSLP, it provides the MRI to the
      NSLP application and requests it to make a decision on whether to peer
      with the querying node. If the NSLP application chooses to peer, GIST
      sets up a Message Routing State (MRS) between the two nodes for the
      future exchange of NSLP data. State setup is performed by a three-way
      handshake that allows for negotiation of signaling flow parameters and
      provides counter-measures against several attacks like denial-of-service
      by using cookie mechanisms and a late state installation option.
</p>
<p>If a transport connection is required and needs to provide for
      reliable or secure signaling, like TCP or TLS/TCP, a Messaging
      Association (MA) is established between the two peers. An MA can be
      re-used for signaling messages concerning several different data flows,
      i.e., signaling messages between two nodes are multiplexed over the same
      transport connection. This can be done when the transport requirements
      (reliability, security) of a new flow can be met with an existing MA,
      i.e., the security and transport properties of an existing MA are
      equivalent or better than what is requested for a potential new MA.
</p>
<p>For path-coupled signaling, we need to find the nodes on the data
      path that should take part in the signaling of an NSLP and invoke them
      to act on the arrival of such NSLP signaling messages. The basic concept
      is that such nodes along a flow's data path intercept the corresponding
      signaling packets and are thus discovered automatically. GIST places a
      Router Alert Option (RAO) in Query message packets to ensure that they
      are intercepted by relevant NSIS aware nodes as in RSVP.
</p>
<p>Late in the development of GIST serious concerns were raised in the
      IETF about the security risks and performance implications of extensive
      usage of the RAO <a class='info' href='#I-D.rahman-rtg-router-alert-dangerous'>[I&#8209;D.rahman&#8209;rtg&#8209;router&#8209;alert&#8209;dangerous]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Rahman, R. and D. Ward, &ldquo;Use of IP Router Alert Considered Dangerous,&rdquo; October&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. Additionally
      evidence was discovered indicating that several existing implementations
      of RAO were inconsistent with the (intention of the) standards and would
      not support the NSIS usage. There were also concerns that extending the
      need for RAO recognition in the fast path of routers that are frequently
      implemented in hardware would delay or deter implementation and
      deployment of NSIS. Eventually it was decided that NSIS would continue
      to specify RAO as its primary means for triggering interception of
      signaling messages in intermediate nodes on the data path, but the
      protocol suite would be published with Experimental status rather than
      on the Standards Track while deployment experience was gathered. More
      information about the use of RAO in GIST can be found in <a class='info' href='#I-D.hancock-nsis-gist-rao'>[I&#8209;D.hancock&#8209;nsis&#8209;gist&#8209;rao]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hancock, R., &ldquo;Using the Router Alert Option for Packet Interception in GIST,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. Also the deployment issues
      that arise from the use of RAO are discussed in <a class='info' href='#rao_deployment'>Section&nbsp;6.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Deployment Issues Due to Use of RAO</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>Alternative mechanisms have been considered to allow nodes to
      recognize NSIS signaling packets that should be intercepted. For example
      NSIS nodes could recognize UDP packets directed to a specific
      destination port as Query messages that need to be intercepted even
      though they are not addressed to the intercepting node. GIST provides
      for the use of such alternatives as a part of its extensibility design.
      NSIS recognizes that the workload imposed by intercepting signaling
      packets could be considerable relative to the work needed just to
      forward such packets. To keep the necessary load to a minimum NSIS
      provides mechanisms to limit the number of interceptions needed by
      constraining the rate of generation and allowing for intentional
      bypassing of signaling nodes that are not affected by particular
      signaling requests. This can be accomplished either in GIST or in the
      NSLP.
</p>
<p>Since GIST carries information about the data flow inside its
      messages (in the MRI), NAT gateways must be aware of GIST in order to
      let it work correctly. GIST provides a special object for NAT traversal
      so that the actual translation is disclosed if a GIST-aware NAT gateway
      provides this object.
</p>
<p>As with RSVP, all the state installed by NSIS protocols is
      "soft-state" that will expire and be automatically removed unless it is
      periodically refreshed. NSIS state is held both at the signaling
      application layer and in the signaling transport layer, and is
      maintained separately. NSLPs control the lifetime of the state in the
      signaling application layer by setting a timeout and sending periodic
      "keep alive" messages along the signaling path if no other messages are
      required. The MAs and the routing state are maintained
      semi-independently by the transport layer, because MAs may be used by
      multiple NSLP sessions, and can also be recreated "on demand" if the
      node needs to reclaim resources. The transport layer can send its own
      "keep alive" messages across a MA if no NSLP messages have been sent,
      for example if the transport layer decides to maintain a heavily used MA
      even though there is no current NSLP session using it. State can also be
      deleted explicitly when no longer needed.
</p>
<p>If there is a change in the route used by a flow for which NSIS has
      created state, NSIS needs to detect the change in order to determine if
      the new path contains additional NSIS nodes that should have state
      installed. GIST may use a range of triggers in order to detect a route
      change. It probes periodically for the next peer by sending a GIST
      Query, thereby detecting a changed route and GIST peer. GIST monitors
      routing tables, the GIST peer states, and notifies NSLPs of any routing
      changes. It is then up to the NSLPs to act appropriately, if needed,
      e.g., by issuing a refresh message. The periodic queries also serve to
      maintain the soft-state in nodes as long as the route is unchanged.
</p>
<p>In summary, GIST provides several services in one package to the
      upper layer signaling protocols:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Signaling peer discovery: GIST is able to find the next hop node
          that runs the NSLP being signaled for.
</li>
<li>Multiplexing: GIST reuses already established signaling
          relationships and messaging associations to next hop peers if the
          signaling flows require the same transport attributes.
</li>
<li>Transport: GIST provides transport with different attributes,
          namely reliable/unreliable and secure/unsecure.
</li>
<li>Confidentiality: If security is requested, GIST uses TLS to
          provide an encrypted and integrity protected message transport to
          the next signaling peer.
</li>
<li>Routing changes: GIST detects routing changes, but instead of
          acting on its own, it merely sends a notification to the local NSLP.
          It is then up to the NSLP to act.
</li>
<li>Fragmentation: GIST uses either a known Path MTU for the next hop
          or limits its message size to 576 bytes when using UDP, and
          especially for Query mode messages. If fragmentation is required it
          automatically establishes an MA and sends the signaling traffic over
          a reliable protocol, e.g., TCP.
</li>
<li>State maintenance: GIST establishes and then maintains the
          soft-state that controls communications through MAs between GIST
          peers along the signaling path, according to usage parameters
          supplied by NSLPs and local policies.
</li>
</ul>

Quality of Service NSLP</h3>

<p>The Quality of Service (QoS) NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP)
      establishes and maintains state at nodes along the path of a data flow
      for the purpose of providing some forwarding resources for that flow. It
      is intended to satisfy the QoS-related requirements of RFC 3726 <a class='info' href='#RFC3726'>[RFC3726]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Brunner, M., &ldquo;Requirements for Signaling Protocols,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>. No support for QoS architectures based on
      bandwidth brokers or other off-path resource managers is currently
      included.
</p>
<p>The design of the QoS NSLP is conceptually similar to RSVP, RFC 2205
      <a class='info' href='#RFC2205'>[RFC2205]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, B., Zhang, L., Berson, S., Herzog, S., and S. Jamin, &ldquo;Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) -- Version 1 Functional Specification,&rdquo; September&nbsp;1997.</span><span>)</span></a>, and uses soft-state peer-to-peer refresh
      messages as the primary state management mechanism (i.e., state
      installation/refresh is performed between pairs of adjacent NSLP nodes,
      rather than in an end-to-end fashion along the complete signaling path).
      The QoS NSLP extends the set of reservation mechanisms to meet the
      requirements of RFC 3726 <a class='info' href='#RFC3726'>[RFC3726]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Brunner, M., &ldquo;Requirements for Signaling Protocols,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>, in particular
      support of sender or receiver-initiated reservations, as well as, a type
      of bi-directional reservation and support of reservations between
      arbitrary nodes, e.g., edge-to-edge, end-to-access, etc. On the other
      hand, there is currently no support for IP multicast.
</p>
<p>A distinction is made between the operation of the signaling protocol
      and the information required for the operation of the Resource
      Management Function (RMF). RMF-related information is carried in the
      QSpec (QoS Specification) object in QoS NSLP messages. This is similar
      to the decoupling between RSVP and the IntServ architecture, RFC 1633
      <a class='info' href='#RFC1633'>[RFC1633]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Braden, B., Clark, D., and S. Shenker, &ldquo;Integrated Services in the Internet Architecture: an Overview,&rdquo; June&nbsp;1994.</span><span>)</span></a>. The QSpec carries information on
      resources available, resources required, traffic descriptions and other
      information required by the RMF. A template for QSpec objects is defined
      in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;qspec]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ash, G., Bader, A., Kappler, C., and D. Oran, &ldquo;QoS NSLP QSPEC Template,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. This provides a number of
      basic parameter objects that can be used as a common language to specify
      components of concrete QoS models. The objects defined in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;qspec]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ash, G., Bader, A., Kappler, C., and D. Oran, &ldquo;QoS NSLP QSPEC Template,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> provide the building blocks for
      many existing QoS models such as those associated with RSVP and
      Differentiated Services. The extensibility of the template allows new
      QoS model specifications to extend the template language as necessary to
      support these specifications.
</p>
<p>The QoS NSLP supports different QoS models, because it does not
      define the QoS mechanisms and RMF that have to be used in a domain. As
      long as a domain knows how to perform admission control for a given
      QSpec, QoS NSLP actually does not care how the specified constraints are
      enforced and met, e.g., by putting the related data flow in the topmost
      of four DiffServ classes, or by putting it into the third highest of
      twelve DiffServ classes. The particular QoS configuration used is up to
      the network provider of the domain. The QSpec can be seen as a common
      language to express QoS requirements between different domains and QoS
      models.
</p>
<p>In short, the functionality of the QoS NSLP includes: </p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Conveying resource requests for unicast flows
</li>
<li>Resource requests (QSpec) that are decoupled from the signaling
          protocol (QoS NSLP)
</li>
<li>Sender- and receiver-initiated reservations, as well as,
          bi-directional
</li>
<li>Soft-state and reduced refresh (keep-alive) signaling
</li>
<li>Session binding, session X can be valid only if session Y is
          too
</li>
<li>Message scoping, end-to-end, edge-to-edge or end-to-edge (proxy
          mode)
</li>
<li>Protection against message re-ordering and duplication
</li>
<li>Group tear, tearing down several session with a single
          message
</li>
<li>Support for re-routing, e.g., due to mobility
</li>
<li>Support for request priorities and preemption
</li>
<li>Stateful and stateless nodes: stateless operation is particularly
          relevant in core networks where large amounts of QoS state could
          easily overwhelm a node
</li>
<li>Reservation aggregation
</li>
</ul>

<p>The protocol also provides for a proxy mode to allow the QoS
      signaling to be implemented without needing all end hosts to be capable
      of handling NSIS signaling.
</p>
<p>The QSpec Template supports situations where the QoS parameters need
      to be fine-grained, specifically targeted to an individual flow in one
      part of the network (typically the edge or access part) but might need
      to be more coarse-grained, where the flow is part of an aggregate
      (typically in the core of the network).

NAT/Firewall Traversal NSLP</h3>

<p>The NAT/Firewall Traversal NSLP <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-nslp-natfw'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;nslp&#8209;natfw]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Stiemerling, M., Tschofenig, H., Aoun, C., and E. Davies, &ldquo;NAT/Firewall NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP),&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a> lets end-hosts interact with
      NAT and firewall devices in the data path. Basically it allows for a
      dynamic configuration of NATs and/or firewalls along the data path in
      order to enable data flows to traverse these devices without being
      obstructed. For instance, firewall pinholes could be opened on demand by
      authorized hosts. Furthermore, it is possible to block unwanted incoming
      traffic on demand, e.g., if an end-host is under attack.
</p>
<p>Configurations to be implemented in NAT and firewall devices signaled
      by the NAT/Firewall NSLP take the form of a (Pattern, Action) pair,
      where the pattern specifies a template for packet header fields to be
      matched. The device is then expected to apply the specified action to
      any passing packet that matches the template. Actions are currently
      limited to ALLOW (forward the packet) and DENY (drop the packet). The
      template specification allows for a greater range of packet fields to be
      matched than those allowed for in the GIST MRI.
</p>
<p>Basically NAT/Firewall signaling starts at the data sender (NSIS
      Initiator) before any actual application data packets are sent.
      Signaling messages may pass several NAT/Firewall NSLP-aware middleboxes
      (NSIS Forwarder) on their way downstream and usually hit the receiver
      (being the NSIS Responder). A proxy mode is also available for cases
      where the NAT/Firewall NSLP is not fully supported along the complete
      data path. NAT/Firewall NSLP is based on a soft-state concept, i.e., the
      sender must periodically repeat its request in order to keep it
      active.
</p>
<p>Additionally, the protocol also provides functions for receivers
      behind NATs. The receiver may request an external address that is
      reachable from outside. The reserved external address must, however, be
      communicated to the sender out-of-band by other means, e.g., by
      application level signaling. After this step the data sender may
      initiate a normal NAT/Firewall signaling in order to create firewall
      pinholes.
</p>
<p>The protocol also provides for a proxy mode to allow the NAT/Firewall
      signaling to be implemented without needing all end hosts to be capable
      of handling NSIS signaling.

Deploying the Protocols</h3>

<p>The initial version of the NSIS protocol suite is being published
      with the status of Experimental Protocols in order to gain deployment
      experience. Concerns over the security, implementation and
      administrative issues surrounding the use of RAO are likely to mean that
      initial deployments occur in 'walled gardens' where the characteristics
      of hardware in use are well known and there is a high level of trust and
      control over the end nodes that use the protocols. This section
      addresses issues that need to be considered in a deployment of the NSIS
      protocol suite.
</p>
<p>First of all, NSIS implementations must be available in at least some
      of the corresponding network nodes (i.e., routers, firewalls, or NAT
      gateways) and end-hosts. That means not only GIST support, but also the
      NSLPs and their respective control functions (such as a resource
      management function for QoS admission control etc.) must be implemented.
      NSIS is capable of incremental deployment and an initial deployment does
      not need to involve every node in a network domain. This is discussed
      further in <a class='info' href='#incremental'>Section&nbsp;6.3<span> (</span><span class='info'>Incremental Deployment and Workarounds</span><span>)</span></a>. There are a number of
      obstacles that may be encountered due to broken implementations of RAO
      (see <a class='info' href='#rao_deployment'>Section&nbsp;6.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Deployment Issues Due to Use of RAO</span><span>)</span></a>) and firewalls or NATs
      dropping NSIS signaling packets (see <a class='info' href='#filtering'>Section&nbsp;6.2<span> (</span><span class='info'>Deployment Issues with NATs and Firewalls</span><span>)</span></a>).
</p>
<p>Another important issue is that applications may need to be made
      NSIS-aware, thereby requiring some effort on the applications
      programmer's behalf. Alternatively, it may be possible to implement
      separate applications to control, e.g., the network QoS requests or
      firewall pinholes, without needing to update the actual applications
      that will take advantage of NSIS capabilities.

<a name="rfc.section.6.1"></a><h3>6.1.&nbsp;
Deployment Issues Due to Use of RAO</h3>

<p>The standardized version of GIST depends on routers and other
        middleboxes correctly recognizing and acting on packets containing
        RAO. There are a number of problems related to RAO that can obstruct a
        deployment of NSIS:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Some implementations do not respond to RAO at all.
</li>
<li>Some implementations respond but do not distinguish between the
            RAO parameter values in IP version 4 (IPv4) packets or reject
            anything except 0 (in which case only the value 0 can be used)
</li>
<li>The response to RAO in a GIST Query mode packet, which is sent
            using the UDP transport, is to dispatch the packet to the UDP
            stack in the intercepting node rather than a function associated
            with the RAO parameter. Since the node will not normally have a
            normal UDP receiver for these packets they are dropped
</li>
<li>The major security concern with RAO in NSIS is that it provides
            a new vector for hosts to mount a (Distributed) Denial of Service
            (DDOS) attack on the control plane of routers on the data path.
            Such attacks have occurred and it is therefore normal for service
            providers to prohibit "host-to-router" signaling packets such as
            RSVP or NSIS from entering their networks from customer networks.
            This will tend to limit the deployment of NSIS to "walled gardens"
            unless a suitable mitigation of the DDOS threat can be found and
            deployed.
</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to deploy NSIS effectively routers and other hardware
        needs to be selected and correctly configured to respond to RAO and
        dispatch intercepted packets to the NSIS function.
</p>
<p>A further obstacle results from likelihood that IPv4 packets with
        IP options of any kind will be filtered and dropped by firewalls and
        NATs. In many cases this is the default behavior so that explicit
        configuration is needed to allow packets carrying the RAO to pass
        through. The general inclination of domain administrators is to deny
        access to packets carrying IP options because of the security risks
        and the additional load on the routers in the domain. The situation
        with IPv6 may be easier as the RAO option in IPv6 is better defined
        but the security concerns remain.
</p>
<p>Deployment issues are discussed at more length in Appendix C of the
        GIST specification <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;ntlp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and M. Stiemerling, &ldquo;GIST: General Internet Signalling Transport,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.

Deployment Issues with NATs and Firewalls</h3>

<p>NAT gateways and firewalls may also hinder initial deployment of
        NSIS protocols for several reasons:</p>
<ul class="text">
<li>They may filter and drop signaling traffic as described in
            <a class='info' href='#rao_deployment'>Section&nbsp;6.1<span> (</span><span class='info'>Deployment Issues Due to Use of RAO</span><span>)</span></a> to deny access to packets
            containing IP options.
</li>
<li>They may not permit "unsolicited" incoming GIST Query mode
            packets. This behavior has been anticipated in the design of the
            protocols but requires additional support to ensure that the
            middleboxes are primed to accept the incoming queries (see <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;qos&#8209;nslp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Manner, J., Karagiannis, G., and A.

</li>
<li>NATs that are not aware of the NSIS protocols will generally
            perform address translations that are not coordinated with the
            NSIS protocols. Since NSIS signaling messages may be carrying
            embedded IP addresses affected by these translations, it may not
            be possible to operate NSIS through such legacy NATs. The
            situation and workarounds are discussed in Section 7.2.1 of <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;ntlp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and M.

<a name="rfc.section.6.3"></a><h3>6.3.&nbsp;
Incremental Deployment and Workarounds</h3>

<p>NSIS is specifically designed to be incrementally deployable. It is
        not required that all nodes on the signaling and data path are NSIS
        aware. To make any use of NSIS at least two nodes on the path need to
        be NSIS aware. However, it is not essential that the initiator and
        receiver of the data flow are NSIS aware. Both the QoS and
        NAT/Firewall NSLPs provide "proxy modes" in which nodes adjacent to
        the initiator and/or receiver can act as proxy signaling initiator or
        receiver. An initiator proxy can monitor traffic and, hopefully,
        detect when a data flow of a type needing NSIS support is being
        initiated. The proxies can act more or less transparently on behalf of
        the data flow initiator and/or receiver to set up the required NSIS
        state and maintain it while the data flow continues. This capability
        reduces the immediate need to modify all the data flow end points
        before NSIS is viable.

Security Features</h3>

<p>Basic security functions are provided at the GIST layer, e.g.,
      protection against some blind or denial-of-service attacks, but note
      that introduction of alternative MRMs may provide attack avenues that
      are not present with the current emphasis on the path-coupled MRM.
      Conceptually it is difficult to protect against on-path attacker and
      man-in-the-middle attacks when using path-coupled MRMs, because a basic
      functionality of GIST is to discover yet unknown signaling peers.
      Transport security can be requested by signaling applications and is
      realized by using TLS between signaling peers, i.e., authenticity and
      confidentiality of signaling messages can be assured between peers. GIST
      allows for mutual authentication of the signaling peers (using TLS means
      like certificates) and can verify the authenticated identity against a
      database of nodes authorized to take part in GIST signaling. It is,
      however, a matter of policy that the identity of peers is verified and
      accepted upon establishment of the secure TLS connection.
</p>
<p>While GIST is handling authentication of peer nodes, more fine
      grained authorization may be required in the NSLP protocols. There is
      currently an ongoing work to specify common authorization mechanisms to
      be used in NSLP protocols <a class='info' href='#I-D.manner-nsis-nslp-auth'>[I&#8209;D.manner&#8209;nsis&#8209;nslp&#8209;auth]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Manner, J., Stiemerling, M., Tschofenig, H., and R. Bless, &ldquo;Authorization for NSIS Signaling Layer Protocols,&rdquo; July&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>, thus allowing, e.g.,
      per-user and per-service authorization.

Extending the Protocols</h3>

<p>This section discusses the ways that are available to extend the NSIS
      protocol suite. The Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) Framework <a class='info' href='#RFC4080'>[RFC4080]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hancock, R., Karagiannis, G., Loughney, J., and S. Van den Bosch, &ldquo;Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS): Framework,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2005.</span><span>)</span></a> describes a two-layer framework for signaling
      on the Internet, comprising a generic transport layer with specific
      signaling layer protocols to address particular applications running
      over this transport layer. The model is designed to be highly extensible
      so that it can be adapted for different signaling needs.
</p>
<p>It is expected that additional signaling requirements will be
      identified in future. The two layer approach allows for NSLP signaling
      applications to be developed independently of the transport protocol.
      Further NSLPs can therefore be developed and deployed to meet these new
      needs using the same GIST infrastructure thereby providing a level of
      macro-extensibility. However, the GIST protocol and the two signaling
      applications have been designed so that additional capabilities can be
      incorporated into the design should additional requirements within the
      general scope of these protocols need to be accommodated.
</p>
<p>The NSIS framework is also highly supportive of incremental
      deployment. A new NSLP need not be available on every NSIS aware node in
      a network or along a signaling path in order to start using it. Nodes
      that do not (yet) support the application will forward its signaling
      messages without complaint until it reaches a node where the new NSLP
      application is deployed.
</p>
<p>One key functionality of parameter objects carried in NSIS protocols
      is the so-called "Extensibility flags (AB)". All the existing protocols
      (and any future ones conforming to the standards) can carry new
      experimental objects, where the AB-flags can indicate whether a
      receiving node must interpret the object, or whether it can just drop
      them or pass them along in subsequent messages sent out further on the
      path. This functionality allows defining new objects without forcing all
      network entities to understand them.

Overview of Administrative Actions Needed When Extending NSIS </h3>

<p>Generally, NSIS protocols can be extended in multiple ways, many of
        which require the allocation of unique code point values in registries
        maintained by IANA on behalf of the IETF. This section is an overview
        of the administrative mechanisms that might apply. The extensibility
        rules are based upon the procedures by which IANA assigns values:
        "Standards Action" (as defined in <a class='info' href='#RFC5226'>[RFC5226]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T. and H. Alvestrand, &ldquo;Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs,&rdquo; May&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>),
        "IETF Action", "Expert Review", and "Organization/Vendor Private",
        defined below. The appropriate procedure for a particular type of code
        point is defined in one or other of the NSIS protocol documents,
        mostly <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;ntlp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and M. Stiemerling, &ldquo;GIST: General Internet Signalling Transport,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>In addition to registered code points, all NSIS protocols provide
        code points that can be used for experimentation, usually within
        closed networks, as explained in <a class='info' href='#RFC3692'>[RFC3692]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Narten, T., &ldquo;Assigning Experimental and Testing Numbers Considered Useful,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2004.</span><span>)</span></a>. There
        is no guarantee that independent experiments will not be using the
        same code point!

GIST</h3>

<p>GIST is extensible in several aspects covered in the subsections
        below. In these subsections, references to document sections refer to
        the GIST specification <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;ntlp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and M. Stiemerling, &ldquo;GIST: General Internet Signalling Transport,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>. The
        bullet points at the end of each subsection specify the formal
        administrative actions that would need to carried out when a new
        extension is standardized.
</p>
<p>More generally, as asserted in Section 1 of the GIST specification,
        the GIST design could be extended to cater for multicast flows and for
        situations where the signaling is not tied to an end-to-end data flow.
        However it is not clear whether this could be done in a totally
        backwards compatible way, and is not considered within the
        extensibility model of NSIS.

This MRM would direct
          signaling towards an explicit target address other than the
          (current) data flow destination and is intended to assist setting up
          of state on a new path during "make-before-break" handover sequences

Query Mode Packet Interception Schemes</h3>

<p>GIST has standardized a scheme using RAO mechanisms<a class='info' href='#I-D.hancock-nsis-gist-rao'>[I&#8209;D.hancock&#8209;nsis&#8209;gist&#8209;rao]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Hancock, R., &ldquo;Using the Router Alert Option for Packet Interception in GIST,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> with UDP packets. If the
          difficulties of deploying the RAO scheme prove insuperable in
          particular circumstances, alternative interception schemes can be
          specified. One proposal that was explored for GIST used UDP port
          recognition in routers rather than RAO mechanisms to drive the
          interception of packets. See Sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.2.5. Each NSLP
          needs to specify membership of an "interception class" whenever it
          sends a message through GIST. A packet interception scheme can
          support one or more interception classes. In principle, a GIST
          instance can support multiple packet interception schemes, but each
          interception class needs to be associated with exactly one
          interception scheme in a GIST instance and GIST instances that use
          different packet interception schemes for the same interception
          class will not be interoperable.
</p>
<p>Defining an alternative interception class mechanism for
          incorporation into GIST should be considered as a very radical step
          and all alternatives should be considered before taking this path.
          The main reason for this is that the mechanism will necessarily
          require additional operations on every packet passing through the
          affected router interfaces. A number of considerations should be
          taken into account:</p>

<li>Although the interception mechanism need only be deployed on

<li>Any packet fields to be examined should be normally close to

</li>
<li>The logic required to determine if a packet should be
              intercepted needs to be kept simple to minimise the extra
              per-packet processing.

<li>The mechanism should be applicable to both IPv4 and IPv6

<li>Packet interception mechanisms potentially provide an attack

              are diverted into the "slow path" and hence can significantly
              increase the load on the general processing capability of the

              designed to minimize the attack surface.

QoS NSLP</h3>

<p>The QoS NSLP provides signaling for QoS reservations on the
        Internet. The QoS NSLP decouples the resource reservation model or
        architecture (QoS model) from the signaling. The signaling protocol is
        defined in Quality of Service NSLP (QoS NSLP) <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-qos-nslp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;qos&#8209;nslp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Manner, J., Karagiannis, G., and A. McDonald, &ldquo;NSLP for Quality-of-Service Signaling,&rdquo; January&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>. The QoS models are defined in
        separate specifications and the QoS NSLP can operate with one or more
        of these models as required by the environment where it is used. It is
        anticipated that additional QoS models will be developed to address
        various Internet scenarios in the future. Extensibility of QoS models
        is considered in <a class='info' href='#model_ext'>Section&nbsp;8.4<span> (</span><span class='info'>QoS Specifications</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The QoS NSLP specifically mentions the possibility of using
        alternative Message Routing Methods (MRMs), apart from the general
        ability to extend NSLPs using new objects with the standard "AB"
        extensibility flags to allow them to be used in new and old
        implementations.
</p>
<p>There is already work to extend the base QoS NSLP and GIST to
        enable new QoS signaling scenarios. One such proposal is the
        Inter-Domain Reservation Aggregation aiming to support large-scale
        deployment of the QoS NSLP <a class='info' href='#I-D.bless-nsis-resv-aggr'>[I&#8209;D.bless&#8209;nsis&#8209;resv&#8209;aggr]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Doll, M. and R.

QoS Specifications</h3>

<p>The QoS Specification template (QSpec) is defined in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;qspec]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ash, G., Bader, A., Kappler, C., and D. Oran, &ldquo;QoS NSLP QSPEC Template,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>. This provides the language in
        which the requirements of specific QoS models are described.
        Introduction of a new QoS model involves defining a new QSpec. In
        order to have a new QSpec allocated by IANA there must an acceptable
        published specification that defines the specific elements within the
        QSpec used in the new model. See <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;qspec]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ash, G., Bader, A., Kappler, C., and D. Oran, &ldquo;QoS NSLP QSPEC Template,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a> for details.
</p>
<p>The introduction of new QoS models is designed to enable deployment
        of NSIS-based QoS control in specific scenarios. One such example is
        the Integrated Services Controlled Load Service for NSIS <a class='info' href='#I-D.kappler-nsis-qosmodel-controlledload'>[I&#8209;D.kappler&#8209;nsis&#8209;qosmodel&#8209;controlledload]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Kappler, C., Fu, X., and B. Schloer, &ldquo;A QoS Model for Signaling IntServ Controlled-Load Service with NSIS,&rdquo; April&nbsp;2010.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>A key feature provided by defining the QSpec template is support of
        a common language for describing QoS requirements and capabilities,
        which can be reused by any QoS models intending to use the QoS NSLP to
        signal their requirements for traffic flows. The commonality of the
        QSpec parameters ensures a certain level of interoperability of QoS
        models and reduces the demands on hardware that has to implement the
        QoS control. Optional QSpec parameters support the extensibility of
        the QoS NSLP to other QoS models in the future; new QSpec parameters
        can be defined in the document that defines a new QoS model. See
        Sections 4.4 and 7 of <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;qspec]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ash, G., Bader, A., Kappler, C., and D. Oran, &ldquo;QoS NSLP QSPEC Template,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>The QSpec consists of a QSpec version number, QSpec objects plus
        specification of processing and procedures that can be used to build
        many QoS models. The definition of a QSpec can be revised without
        necessarily changing the version if the changes are functionally
        backwards compatible. If changes are made that are not backwards
        compatible then a new QSpec version number has to be assigned. Note
        that a new QSpec version number is not needed just because new
        additional QSpec parameters are specified; new versions will be needed
        only if the existing functionality is modified. The template includes
        version negotiation procedures that allow the originator of an NSLP
        message to retry with a lower QSpec version if the receiver rejects a
        message because it does not support the QSpec version signaled in the
        message. See Section 3.2 of <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-qspec'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;qspec]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Ash, G., Bader, A., Kappler, C., and D. Oran, &ldquo;QoS NSLP QSPEC Template,&rdquo; November&nbsp;2008.</span><span>)</span></a>.

<a name="rfc.section.8.6"></a><h3>8.6.&nbsp;
New NSLP Protocols</h3>

<p>Designing a new NSLP is both challenging and easy.
</p>
<p>New signaling applications with associated NSLPs can be defined to
        work in parallel or replace the applications already defined by the
        NSIS working group. Applications that fit into the NSIS framework will
        be expected to use GIST to provide transport of signaling messages and
        appropriate security facilities which relieves the application
        designer of many "lower level" problems. GIST provides many important
        functions through the API that it exposes to the signaling application
        layer code, and allows the signaling application programmer to
        offload, e.g., the channel security, transport characteristics and
        signaling node discovery to GIST.
</p>
<p>Yet, on the other hand, the signaling application designer must
        take into account that the network environment can be dynamic, both in
        terms of routing and node availability. The new NSLP designer must
        take into account at least the following issues:
</p>
<p></p>
<ul class="text">
<li>Routing changes, e.g., due to mobility: GIST sends Network
            Notifications when something happens in the network, e.g., peers
            or routing paths change. All signaling applications must be able
            to handle these notifications and act appropriately. GIST does not
            include logic to figure out what the NSLP would want to do due to
            a certain network event. Therefore, GIST gives the notification to
            the application, and lets it make the right decision.<br />
<br />

</li>
<li>GIST indications: GIST will also send other notifications,
            e.g., if a signaling peer does not reply to refresh messages, or a
            certain NSLP message was not successfully delivered to the
            recipient. NSLP applications must also be able to handle these
            events. Appendix B in the GIST specification discusses the
            GIST-NSLP API and the various functionality required, but
            implementing this interface can be quite challenging; the
            multitude of asynchronous notifications that can arrive from GIST
            increases the implementation complexity of the NSLP.<br />
<br />

</li>
<li>Lifetime of the signaling flow: NSLPs should inform GIST when a
            flow is no longer needed using the SetStateLifetime primitive.
            This reduces bandwidth demands in the network.<br />
<br />

</li>
<li>NSLP IDs: NSLP messages may be multiplexed over GIST MAs. The
            new NSLP needs to use a unique NSLPID to ensure that its messages
            are delivered to the correct application by GIST. A single NSLP
            could use multiple NSLPIDs, for example to distinguish different
            classes of signaling nodes that might handle different levels of
            aggregation of requests or alternative processing paths. Note that
            unlike GIST, the NSLPs do not provide a protocol versioning
            mechanism. If the new NSLP is an upgraded version of an existing
            NSLP, then it should be distinguished by a different
            NSLPID.<br />
<br />
 
<ul class="text">
<li>A new generally available NSLP requires IESG approval for
                the allocation of a new NSLP ID <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;ntlp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and M. Stiemerling, &ldquo;GIST: General Internet Signalling Transport,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a><br />
<br />

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Incremental deployment: It would generally be unrealistic to
            expect every node on the signaling path to have a new NSLP
            implemented immediately. New NSLPs need to allow for this. The QoS
            and NATFW NSLPs provide examples of techniques such as proxy modes
            that cater for cases where the data flow originator and/or
            receiver does not implement the NSLP.
</li>
<li>Signaling Message Source IP Address: It is sometimes
            challenging for an NSLP originating a signaling message to
            determine the source IP address that should be used in the
            signaling messages, which may be different from the data flow
            source address used in the MRI. This challenge occurs either when
            a node has multiple interfaces or is acting as a proxy for the
            data flow originator (typically expected to occur during the
            introduction of NSIS when not all nodes are NSIS enabled). A proxy
            signaling flow originator generally needs to know and use the
            correct data flow source IP address at least initially. As
            discussed in Section 5.8.1.2 of <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;ntlp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and M.

            may choose to alter the source IP address after the initial Query
            message has established the flow path in order that ICMP messages
            are directed to the most appropriate node; in the proxy case, the
            data flow originator would be unaware of the signaling flow and
            ICMP messages relating to the signaling would be meaningless if
            passed on to the data flow originator. Hence it is essential that
            an NSLP is aware of the position and role of the node on which it
            is instantiated, and has means of determining the appropriate
            source address to be used and ensuring that this is used on
            signaling packets. <br />

</li>
<li>New MRMs: GIST currently defines two Message Routing Methods,
            and leave the door open for new ideas. Thus, it is possible that a
            new NSLP also requires a new MRM, path-decoupled routing being one
            example.<br />
<br />

</li>
<li>Cooperation with other NSLPs: Some applications might need
            resources from two or more different classes in order to operate
            successfully. The NSLPs managing these resources could operate
            cooperatively to ensure that such requests were coordinated to
            avoid wasting signaling bandwidth and prevent race conditions.
</li>
</ul>

<p>It is essential that the security considerations of a new NSLP are
        carefully analyzed. NSIS NSLPs are deployed in routers as well as host
        systems; a poorly designed NSLP could therefore provide an attack
        vector for network resources as well as end systems. The NSLP must
        also support authorization of users and must allow the use of the GIST
        authentication and integrity protection mechanisms where users deem
        them to be necessary.
</p>
<p>The API between GIST and NSLPs (see Appendix B in <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;ntlp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and M. Stiemerling, &ldquo;GIST: General Internet Signalling Transport,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>) is very important to understand.
        The abstract design in the GIST specification does not specify the
        exact messaging between GIST and the NSLPs but gives an understanding
        of the interactions, especially what kinds of asynchronous
        notifications from GIST the NSLP must be prepared to handle: the
        actual interface will be dependent on each implementation of GIST.
</p>
<p>Messages transmitted by GIST on behalf of an NSLP are identified by
        a unique NSLP identifier (NSLPID). NSLPIDs are 16 bit unsigned numbers
        taken from a registry managed by IANA and defined in Section 9 of the
        GIST specification <a class='info' href='#I-D.ietf-nsis-ntlp'>[I&#8209;D.ietf&#8209;nsis&#8209;ntlp]<span> (</span><span class='info'>Schulzrinne, H. and M. Stiemerling, &ldquo;GIST: General Internet Signalling Transport,&rdquo; June&nbsp;2009.</span><span>)</span></a>.
</p>
<p>A range of values (32704-32767) is available for Private and
        Experimental use during development, but any new signaling application
        that expects to be deployed generally on the Internet needs to be
        defined either in a standards track RFC or, possibly, an experimental
        RFC. Such an RFC would request allocation of unique NSLPID value(s)
        from the IANA registry. There is additional discussion of NSLPIDs in
        Section 3.8 of the GIST specification.

Security Considerations</h3>

<p>This document provides information to the community. It does not
      itself raise new security concerns.
</p>
<p>However, any extensions that are made to the NSIS protocol suite will
      need to be carefully assessed for any security implications. This is
      particularly important because NSIS messages are intended to be actively
      processed by NSIS-capable routers that they pass through, rather than
      simply forwarded as is the case with most IP packets. It is essential
      that extensions provide means to authorize usage of capabilities that
      might allocate resources and recommend the use of appropriate
      authentication and integrity protection measures in order to exclude or
      adequately mitigate any security issues that are identified.
</p>
<p>GIST offers facilities to authenticate NSIS messages and to ensure
      that they are delivered reliably. Extensions must allow these
      capabilities to be used in an appropriate manner to minimize the risks
      of NSIS messages being misused, and must recommend their appropriate
      usage.
</p>
<p>If additional transport protocols are proposed for use in association
      with GIST, an appropriate set of compatible security functions must be
      made available in conjunction with the transport protocol to support the
      authentication and integrity functions expected to be available through
      GIST.
