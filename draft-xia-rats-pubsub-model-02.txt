1.  Introduction

   Remote attestation is for acquiring the evidence about various
   integrity information from remote endpoints to assess its
   trustworthiness (aka, behave in the expected manner).  These evidence
   should be about: system component identity, composition of system
   components, roots of trust, system component integrity, system
   component configuration, operational state and so on.
   [I-D.richardson-rats-usecases] describes possible use cases which
   remote attestation are using for different industries, like: network
   devices, FIDO authentication for online transaction, Cryptographic
   Key Attestation for mobile devices, and so on.

   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] lays a foundation of RATS architecture
   about the key RATS roles (i.e., Relying Party, Verifier, Attester and
   asserter) and the messages they exchange, as well as some key
   concepts.  Based on it,
   [I-D.birkholz-rats-reference-interaction-model] specifies a basic
   challenge-response-based interaction model for the remote attestation
   procedure, which a complete remote attestation procedure is triggered
   by a challenge message originated from the verifier, and finished
   when the attester sends its response message back.  This is a very
   generic interaction model with wide adoption.  This document proposes
   an alternative interaction model for Remote attestation procedure, by

   customizing the NETCONF pub/sub model [RFC8639][RFC8640][RFC8641].
   YANG push [RFC8641] is basically an extensive NETCONF pub/sub model
   mainly for the YANG datastore.  With the nature of asynchronous
   communication, the pub/sub model for remote attestation procedure is
   optimal for large-scale and loosely coupled distributed systems,
   especially for the network devices, which has the advantages as:
   loose coupling, scalability, time delivery sensitivity, supporting
   filtering capability, event-driven and so on.  The pub/sub model can
   be used independently, or together with the challenge-response model
   to complement each other as a whole.  Note that in which way these
   models are combined together are currently out of the scope of this
   draft.

   In summary, by utilizing the pub/sub model in remote attestation
   procedure, the gained benefits are as below:

   o  Flexibility: the verifier does not need to send the challenge
      message every time.  The whole thing of the verifier is to
      subscribe a topic to the attester and then to anticipate the
      period or timely on-change notification from the attester about
      its integrity evidence.

   o  Efficiency: once the verifier has subscribed its interested topics
      related with its triggering condition to the attester, it will get
      all the condition triggered notifications on time, which are the
      integrity related evidence for remote attestation in fact.  It
      will ensure any integrity change/deviation of the remote endpoint
      to be detected with the minimum latency.

   o  Scalability: it will save a lot of challenge messages by replacing
      with single subscription message for one topic stream, and
      decrease the total number of stateful connection between the
      verifier and attester, especially for a very large scale network.
      Thus, the scalability of the solution will increase.

   In short, the basic idea of pub/sub model for remote attestation is
   the verifier subscribes its interested event streams about the
   integrity evidence to the attester.  The event streams can be in the
   YANG datastore, or not.  After the subscription succeeds, the
   attester sends the subscribed integrity evidence back to the
   verifier.  During subscription, the verifier may also specify how the
   attester returns the subscribed information, that is, the update
   trigger as periodic subscription or on-change subscription.  And when
   the selection filters are applied to the subscription, only the
   information that pass the filter will be distributed out.

   More detailed, the key steps of the remote attestation workflow with
   this model can be summarized as below (using the network devices as
   the example):

   o  The verifier subscribes its interested event streams about the
      integrity evidence to the attester.  More specifically:

      *  The event stream here refers to various integrity evidence
         information related to device trustworthiness, which can be in
         YANG datastore, or not.  The basic event streams may include:
         software integrity information (including PCR values and system
         boot logs) of each layer of the trust chain recorded during
         device booting time; device identity certificates & Attestation
         Key certificate; operating system, application dynamic
         integrity information (e.g., IMA logs) and the device
         configuration information recorded during device running time.

      *  Periodic subscription is mainly used by the verifier for the
         general and non-critical information collection, which are not
         strictly time sensitive and aims for collecting the latest
         integrity evidence and checking the possible deviation.  In
         contrary, on-change subscription is basically used to to
         monitor the critical integrity evidence (e.g., integrity values
         and log files during device booting time, or integrity values
         of some key service processes).  If these integrity values
         change, notifications are sent immediately.

      *  The selection filters may be applied to the subscription, so
         that only the event records that pass the filter will be
         distributed out.  Some specific examples include: event records
         of a component (e.g., line card) in the composite device, the
         event records in a specific time period that includes a start
         time and an end time, and so on.

   o  Consider how to send the existing parameters (i.e., nonce, hash
      signature algorithm, and specified TPM name, etc.) carried in the
      challenge message of the previous challenge-response model to the

      attester through the subscription message of the new sub/pub model
      in advance, and the follow-up usage of them.  A very important
      point is how to ensure that the nonce carried in every
      notification message is different, and both the attester and the
      verifier know the correct value in advance.

   o  Both configuration subscription and dynamic subscription are
      considered.  More specifically:

      *  Configure subscription is for the important security event
         stream.  For example, it enables the monitoring the important
         integrity information by using the on-change mode.

      *  Dynamic subscription is for the normal integrity information,
         that is, periodically receive those related information during
         NETCONF Session.  The corresponding subscription RPC needs to
         be established dynamically.  This way can reduce unnecessary
         NETCONF sessions.

   o  In addition to the update trigger of on-change, the other possible
      update trigger may be certain pre-defined events according to
      [I-D.bryskin-netconf-automation-yang], that is: When these events
      occur, the specified integrity information is triggered to be
      sent, which is the relevant event stream plus optional selection
      filter.  The events may include: device startup completion, device
      upgrade completion, specific attack event, active/standby
      switchover, line card insertion/removal/switchover, certificate
      life cycle event (expiration), etc.

   o  The attester notification delivery mechanisms thus vary as the
      above subscription mechanisms of verifier vary.

   The following sections describes the above key steps one by one.

3.2.  Remote Attestation Event Stream Definition

   The event streams here refers to various integrity evidence
   information related to device trustworthiness.  By definition,
   evidence is typically a set of claims about device's software and
   hardware platform.  So, the remote attestation event stream is
   composed by the claims.  For remote attestation, the basic event
   streams may generally include: system integrity information
   (including PCR values and system boot logs) of each layer of the
   trust chain recorded during device booting time, device credentials
   and their change, operating system and files integrity information
   (e.g., IMA logs) recorded during device running time, and so on.

Internet-Draft                  RATS Push                  February 2020


   The event streams are created and managed by the attester.  And their
   formal definition should be conformed to the information model
   definition like Attestation Evidence or others in
   [I-D.birkholz-rats-information-model], and the claim data model
   definition in [I-D.ietf-rats-yang-tpm-charra] with YANG data format,
   and [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] with COSE data format.

   More specific, for current RATS claims YANG data model in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-yang-tpm-charra] , the following event streams may be
   defined if necessary:

   o  the rats-support-structures datastore node, or its subtree nodes
      like: tpms, compute-nodes.  All these nodes can be subscribed for
      pushing their values periodically or on-change;

   o  For all the YANG RPCs, whether their output are the YANG datastore
      nodes or information stored in the device with other way, the
      event streams can be defined for all of them, such as: tpm12-
      attestation-response, tpm20-attestation-response, attestation-
      certificates and system-event-logs.  If needed, the more fine-
      grained event stream can be defined for the substructure of the
      above, like: endorsement-cert or attestation-cer of the
      attestation-certificates, bios-event-logs or ima-event-logs of the
      system-event-logs.

3.3.  Remote Attestation Subscription Definition

   NETCONF pub/sub model provides several subscription types in which
   approriate one or more types are chosen and possibly used together to
   meet the service requirements.

   Particularly, periodic subscription is mainly used by the verifier
   for the general and non-critical information collection, which are
   not strictly time sensitive and aims for collecting the latest
   integrity information and checking the possible deviation.  In
   contrary, on-change subscription is basically used to monitor the
   critical integrity evidence (e.g., integrity values and log files
   during device booting time, or integrity values of some important
   files).  If these integrity values change, notifications are sent
   immediately.

   Besides, both configuration subscription and dynamic subscription are
   considered.  In which, configure subscription is for the important
   security event stream as it lasts even the NETCONF session is closed.
   For example, it enables the monitoring of the status of important
   security event stream by using the on-change mode.  On the other
   hand, dynamic subscription is for the general security event stream,
   that is, periodically receive those related information during

   NETCONF Session.  The corresponding subscription RPC needs to be
   established dynamically.  This way can reduce unnecessary NETCONF
   sessions.

   For the remote attestation event streams described in the previous
   section, some relatively critical and not frequently changed ones can
   be subscribed as the configuration and on-change subscription, so
   that the verifier can always receive them very timely.  Some examples
   are: tpms, compute-nodes and attestation-certificates event streams.
   In contrary, some normal and frequently changed event streams can be
   the dynamic and/or periodic subscription, the verifier just want to
   receive and monitor them occasionally and reduce the processing.  One
   example is ima-event-logs event stream.

   Furthermore, certain pre-defined events according to
   [I-D.bryskin-netconf-automation-yang], can be the update trigger too,
   that is: When these events occur, the specified integrity information
   is triggered to be sent, which is the relevant event stream with
   optional selection filter.  The events may include: device startup
   completion, device upgrade completion, specific attack event, active/
   standby switchover, line card insertion/removal/switchover,
   certificate life cycle event (expiration), etc.

3.4.  Remote Attestation Selection Filters Definition

   The selection filters may be applied to the subscription, so that
   only the event that pass the filter will be distributed out.  Both
   the pub/sub and the YANG push selection filters can be considered.

   A concrete example of selection filter is limiting the delivered
   event stream to those originated from a specific component with id
   ("xxxxxxxxxx") of a designated vendor ("xxx-vendor-device").

   The other example is filtering the event records in a specific time
   period that has a start time and an end time.

3.5.  Remote Attestation Subscription Parameters Handling

   Most of the parameters carried in the subscription message are not
   changed during the remote attestation procedure, like: hash signature
   algorithm, specified TPM name and so on.  Their main goal is to
   enable the dynamic negotiation with the attester about what
   information the verifier needs and how to construct them together.  A
   very important point is how to ensure that the nonce carried in every
   notification message is different, and both the attester and the
   verifier know the correct value in advance.  For this purpose, the
   basic idea is to ensure that the nonce in two sides of the
   communication is synchronously changed, and the randomness of the

   nonce is maintained.  Specifically, there may be several ways to do
   it:

   o  Verifier sends a seed with hash algorithm to the attester in the
      subscription message, and then perform the synchronization
      operation on both sides.

   o  In fact, the nonce does not need to be random every time.  As long
      as the receive endpoint (here for verifier) can identify
      duplicated packets, other means may be used.  For example: The
      timestamp and increasing count.

   o  The RATS TUDA mechanism [I-D.birkholz-rats-tuda] can also be used
      here to ensure the freshness of information.

3.6.  Remote Attestation Notification Distribution

   Basically, the remote attestation notification is the event stream in
   the YANG notification structure, and the event stream is defined
   above with the same YANG structure as the corresponding the YANG
   datastore node or RPC's output.

   More details are to be added.

3.7.  Summary

   Based on the above discussion, this section gives some examples to
   illustrate the overall application of sub/pub model to remote
   attestation procedure.

   Below is a configured subscription example with on-change update
   trigger, with specific contents as:

   o  There are 3 integrity evidence related event streams as follows:
      pcr-trust-evidence, bios-log-trust-evidence and ima-log-trust-
      evidence.  The subscribed one is pcr-trust-evidence.

   o  The other parameters of the subscription include: pcr-list: {{1,
      3, 7}}, tcg-hash-algo-id: TPM_ALG_SHA256, nonce-value: 0x564ac291,
      TPM_ALG_ID-value: TPM_ALG_ECDSA, pub-key-id: 0x784a22bf, tpms:
      {"tpm1"}.

   o  The selection filter is set as follows: a specific component with
      id ("xxxxxxxxxx") of a designated vendor ("xxx-vendor-device").
