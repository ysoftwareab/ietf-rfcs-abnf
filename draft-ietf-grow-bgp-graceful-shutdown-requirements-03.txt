Abstract 
    
   The BGP protocol is heavily used in Service Provider networks both 
   for Internet and BGP/MPLS VPN services. For resiliency purposes, 
   redundant routers and BGP sessions can be deployed to reduce the 
   consequences of an AS Border Router or BGP session breakdown on 
   customers' or peers' traffic. However simply taking down or even 
   bringing up a BGP session for maintenance purposes may still induce 
   connectivity losses during the BGP convergence. This is no more 
   satisfactory for new applications (e.g. voice over IP, on line 
   gaming, VPN). Therefore, a solution is required for the graceful 
   shutdown of a (set of) BGP session(s) in order to limit the amount of 
   traffic loss during a planned shutdown. This document expresses 
   requirements for such a solution.

2. Introduction 
    
   The BGP protocol is heavily used in Service Provider networks both 
   for Internet and BGP/MPLS VPN services. For resiliency purposes, 
   redundant routers and BGP sessions can be deployed to reduce the 
   consequences of an AS Border Router or BGP session breakdown on 
   customers' or peers' traffic. 
    
   We place ourselves in the context where a Service Provider performs a 
   maintenance operation and needs to shut down one or multiple BGP 
   peering link(s) or a whole ASBR. If an alternate path is available 
   within the AS, the requirement is to avoid or reduce customer or peer 
   traffic loss during the BGP convergence. Indeed, as an alternate path 
   is available in the Autonomous System (AS), it should be made 
   possible to reroute the customer or peer traffic on this backup path 
   before the BGP session(s) is/are torn down, the nominal path 
   withdrawn and the forwarding is interrupted on the nominal path. 
    
   The requirements also cover the subsequent re-establishment of the 
   BGP session as even this "UP" case can currently trigger route loss 
   and thus traffic loss at some routers. 
    
   Currently, BGP [BGP-4] and MP-BGP [MP-BGP] do not include any 
   operation to gracefully withdraw a prefix while traffic toward that 
   prefix could still be correctly forwarded. When a BGP session is 
   taken down, BGP behaves as if it was a sudden link or router failure 
   and withdraws the prefixes learnt over that session, which may 
   trigger traffic loss. There is no mechanism to advertise to its BGP 
   peers that the prefix will soon be unreachable, while still being 
   reachable. When applicable, such mechanism would reduce or prevent 
   traffic loss. It would typically be applicable in case of a 
   maintenance operation requiring the shutdown of a forwarding 
   resource. Typical examples would be a link or line card maintenance, 
   replacement or upgrade. It may also be applicable for a software 
   upgrade as it may involve a firmware reset on the line cards and 
   hence forwarding interruption. 
   The introduction of Route Reflectors as per [RR] to solve scalability 
   issues bound to iBGP full-meshes has worsened the duration of routing 
   convergence as some route reflectors may hide the back up path. Thus 
   depending on RR topology more iBGP hops may be involved in the iBGP 
   convergence.

Requirements for the graceful shutdown of BGP sessions 
 
 
   Note that these planned maintenance operations cannot be addressed by 
   Graceful Restart extensions [GR] as GR only applies when the 
   forwarding is preserved during the control plane restart. On the 
   contrary, Graceful Shutdown applies when the forwarding is 
   interrupted. 
   Note also that some protocols are already considering such graceful 
   shutdown procedure (e.g. GMPLS in [RFC5817]). 
    
   A successful approach of such mechanism should minimize the loss of 
   traffic in most foreseen maintenance situations. 
    
3. Problem statement 
    
   As per [BGP-4], when one (or many) BGP session(s) are shut down, a 
   BGP NOTIFICATION message is sent to the peer and the session is then 
   closed. A protocol convergence is then triggered both by the local 
   router and by the peer. Alternate paths to the destination are 
   selected, if known. If those alternates paths are not known prior to 
   the BGP session shutdown, additional BGP convergence steps are 
   required in each AS to search for an alternate path. 
    
   This behavior is not satisfactory in a maintenance situation because 
   the traffic that was directed towards the removed next-hops may be 
   lost until the end of the BGP convergence. As it is a planned 
   operation, a make before break solution should be made possible. 
    
   As maintenance operations are frequent in large networks 
   [Reliability], the global availability of the network is 
   significantly impaired by this BGP maintenance issue. 
    
3.1. Example of undesirable BGP routing behavior 
    
   To illustrate these problems, let us consider the following example 
   where one customer router "CUST" is dual-attached to two SP routers 
   "ASBR1" and "ASBR2". 
   ASBR1 and ASBR2 are in the same AS and owned by the same service 
   provider. Both are iBGP client of the route reflector R1.

                                '  
    
   Before the maintenance, packets for destination Z/z use the CUST-
   ASBR1 link because R1 selects ASBR1's route based on the IGP cost. 
    
   Let's assume the service provider wants to shutdown the ASBR1-CUST 
   link for maintenance purposes. Currently, when the shutdown is 
   performed on ASBR1, the following steps are performed: 
     1.  ASBR1 sends a withdraw to its route reflector R1 for the prefix 
        Z/z. 
     2. R1 runs its decision process, selects the route from ASBR2 and 
        advertises the new path to ASBR1. 
     3. ASBR1 runs its decision process and recovers the reachability of 
        Z/z. 
    
   Traffic is lost between step 1 when ASBR1 looses its route and step 3 
   when it discovers a new path. 
    
   Note that this is a simplified description for illustrative purpose. 
   In a bigger AS, multiple steps of BGP convergence may be required to 
   find and select the best alternate path (e.g. ASBR1 is chosen based 
   on a higher local pref, hierarchical route reflectors are used...). 
   When multiple BGP routers are involved and plenty of prefixes are 
   affected, the recovery process can take longer than applications 
   requirements. 
    
3.2. Causes of packet loss 
    
   The loss of packets during the maintenance has two main causes: 
   - lack of an alternate path on some routers 
   - transient routing inconsistency. 
    
   Some routers may lack an alternate path because another router is 
   hiding the backup path. This router can be a route reflector only 
   propagating the best path. Or the backup ASBR does not advertise the 
   backup path because it prefers the nominal path. This lack of

   knowledge of the alternate path is the first target of this 
   requirement draft. 
    
   Transient routing inconsistencies happen during iBGP convergence 
   because all routers are not updating their RIB at the same time. This 
   can lead to forwarding loops and then packet drops. This can be 
   avoided by performing only one IP lookup on BGP routes in each AS and 
   by using tunnels (e.g. MPLS LSP) to send packets between ASBRs. 
    
4. Terminology 
    
   g-shut initiator: the router on which the session(s) shutdown is 
   (are) performed for the maintenance. 
    
   g-shut neighbor: a router that peers with the g-shut initiator 
   via (one of) the session(s) undergoing maintenance. 
    
   Affected prefixes: a prefix initially reached via the peering 
   link(s) undergoing maintenance. 
    
   Affected router: a router reaching an affected prefix via a 
   peering link undergoing maintenance. 
    
   Initiator AS: the autonomous system of the g-shut initiator 
   router. 
    
   Neighbor AS(es): the autonomous system(s) of the g-shut neighbor 
   router(s). 
    
5. Goals and requirements 
    
   When a BGP session of the router under maintenance is shut down, the 
   router removes the routes and then triggers the BGP convergence on 
   its BGP peers. The goal of BGP graceful shutdown is to initiate the 
   BGP convergence to find the alternate paths before the nominal paths 
   are removed. As a result, before the nominal BGP session is shut 
   down, all routers learn and use the alternate paths. Then the nominal 
   BGP session can be shut down. 
    
   As a result, provided an alternate path is available in the AS, the 
   packets are rerouted before the BGP session termination and fewer 
   packets (possibly none) are lost during the BGP convergence process 
   since at any time, all routers have a valid path. 
    
   Another goal is to minimize packet loss when the BGP session is re-
   established following the maintenance. 
    
   From the above goals we can derive the following requirements: 
    
   a)   A mechanism to advertise the maintenance action to all affected 
   routers is REQUIRED. Such mechanism may be either implicit or

   explicit. Note that affected routers can be located both in the local 
   AS and in neighboring ASes. 
    
   b)   An Internet wide convergence is OPTIONAL. However if the 
   initiator AS and the neighbor AS(es) have a backup path, they MUST be 
   able to gracefully converge before the nominal path is shut down. 
    
   c)   The proposed solution SHOULD be applicable to any kind of BGP 
   sessions (e-BGP, i-BGP, i-BGP route reflector client, e-BGP 
   confederations, e-BGP multi hop, MultiProtocol BGP extension...) and 
   any address family. If a BGP implementation allows closing a sub-set 
   of AFIs carried in a MP-BGP session, this mechanism MAY be applicable 
   to this sub-set of AFIs. 
    
   Depending on the session type (eBGP, iBGP...), there may be some 
   variations in the proposed solution in order to fit the requirements. 
    
   The following cases should be handled in priority: 
   - The shutdown of an inter-AS link and therefore the shutdown of an 
   eBGP session. 
   - The shutdown of an AS Border Router and therefore the shutdown of 
   all its BGP sessions 
   - The shutdown of a customer access router and all of its BGP 
   sessions. In BGP/MPLS VPN as per [VPN], this router is called a CE 
   and the use of others protocols than BGP on the PE-CE access link 
   should also be considered (static routes, RIPv2, OSPF, IS-IS...). 
    
   d)   The proposed solution SHOULD NOT change the BGP convergence 
   behavior for the ASes exterior to the maintenance process, namely 
   ASes other than the initiator AS and it(s) neighbor AS(es). 
    
   e)   An incremental deployment on a per AS or per BGP session basis 
   SHOULD be made possible. In case of partial deployment the proposed 
   solution SHOULD incrementally improve the maintenance process. The 
   solution SHOULD bring improvements even when one of the two ASes does 
   not support graceful shutdown. In particular, large Service Providers 
   may not be able to upgrade all of the deployed customer premises 
   access routers (CPE). 
    
   f)   Redistribution or advertisement of (static) IP routes into BGP 
   SHOULD also be covered. 
    
   g)   The proposed solution MAY be designed in order to avoid 
   transient forwarding loops. Indeed, forwarding loops increase packet 
   transit delay and may lead to link saturation. 
    
   h)   The specific procedure SHOULD end when the BGP session is 
   closed. The procedure SHOULD be reverted, either automatically or 
   manually, when the session is re-established. During this reversion 
   procedure -when the session is brought up- the procedure SHOULD also 
   minimize packet loss when the nominal path is installed and used

   again. In particular, it SHOULD be ensured that the backup path is 
   not removed from the routing tables of the effected nodes before it 
   learns the nominal path. In the end, once the planned maintenance is 
   finished and the shutdown resource becomes available again, the 
   nominal BGP routing MUST be reestablished. 
 
   i)   The solution SHOULD be simple and simple to operate. Hence it 
   MAY only cover a subset of the cases. 
    
    
   The metrics to evaluate and compare the proposed solutions are, in 
   decreasing order of importance: 
   - The duration of the remaining loss of connectivity when the BGP 
   session is brought down or up 
   - The applicability to a wide range of BGP and network topologies, 
   especially those described in section 6; 
   - The simplicity; 
   - The duration of transient forwarding loops; 
   - The additional load introduced in BGP (eg BGP messages sent to peer 
   routers, peer ASes, the Internet). 
    
6. Reference Topologies 
    
   In order to benchmark the proposed solutions, some typical BGP 
   topologies are detailed in this section. The solution drafts 
   should state its applicability for each of these possible 
   topologies. 
    
   However, solutions SHOULD be applicable to all possible BGP 
   topologies and not only to these below examples. Note that this 
   is a "SHOULD" rather than a "MUST" as a partial lightweight 
   solution may be preferred to a full but more complex solution. 
   Especially since some ISP may not be concerned by some topologies 
   (e.g. confederations). 
    
6.1. E-BGP topologies 
    
   We describe here some frequent eBGP topologies that SHOULD be 
   supported by the solution. 
    
6.1.1. 1 ASBR in AS1 connected to two ASBRs in the neighboring AS2 
    
   In this topology we have an asymmetric protection scheme between 
   AS1 and AS2: 
   - On AS2 side, two different routers are used to connect to AS1. 
   - On AS1 side, one single router with two BGP sessions is used.

   The requirements of section 5 should be applicable to: 
   - Maintenance of any of the ASBR routers (in AS1 or AS2); 
   - Maintenance of one link between AS1 and AS2 performed either on 
     an AS1 or AS2 router.

Requirements for the graceful shutdown of BGP sessions 
 
 
6.1.3. 2 ASBRs in AS2 each connected to two different ASes  
    
   In this topology at least three ASes are involved. Depending on 
   which routes are exchanged between these ASes, some protection 
   for some of the traffic may be possible.

          ASBR3.1----------- ASBR2.2 
                       '     
             AS3       '      AS2  
    
         
   The requirements of section 5 do not translate as easily as in 
   the two previous topologies because we do not require propagating 
   the maintenance advertisement outside of the two ASes involved in 
   an eBGP session. 
   For instance if ASBR2.2 requires a maintenance affecting ASBR3.1, 
   then ASBR3.1 will be notified. However we do not require for ASBR1.1 
   to be notified of the maintenance of the eBGP session between 
   ASBR3.1-ASBR2.2. 
    
6.2. I-BGP topologies 
    
   We describe here some frequent iBGP topologies that SHOULD be 
   supported by the solution. 
    
6.2.1. iBGP Full-Mesh 
    
   In this topology we have a full mesh of iBGP sessions: 
    
           P1 ------ P2 
           | \     / | 
           |  \   /  |

Requirements for the graceful shutdown of BGP sessions 
 
 
   When the session between ASBR1.1 and ASBR2.1 undergoes 
   maintenance, it is required that all i-BGP peers of ASBR1.1 
   reroute traffic to ASBR1.2 before the session between ASBR1.1 and 
   ASBR2.1 is shut down. 
                               
    
    
6.2.2. Route Reflector 
    
   In this topology, route reflectors are used to limit the number of 
   i-BGP sessions. 
    
           P1 RR----- P2 RR 
           | \       / | 
           |  \     /  |

         ASBR1.1     ASBR1.2 
            \          / 
             \        / 
        ''''''\''''''/'''''''''''' 
               \    /       
                \  /         AS2 
               ASBR2.1 
    
   When the session between ASBR1.1 and ASBR2.1 undergoes 
   maintenance, it is required that all BGP routers of AS1 reroute 
   traffic to ASBR1.2 before the session between ASBR1.1 and ASBR2.1 
   is shut down. 
    
6.2.3. hierarchical Route Reflector 
    
   In this topology, hierarchical route reflectors are used to limit 
   the number of i-BGP sessions.

                \     /        AS2 
                 ASBR2.1   
    
   When the session between ASBR1.1 and ASBR2.1 undergoes 
   maintenance, it is required that all BGP routers of AS1 reroute 
   traffic to ASBR1.2 before the session between ASBR1.1 and ASBR2.1 
   is shut down. 
    
6.2.4. Confederations 
    
   In this topology, a confederation of ASs is used to limit the number 
   of i-BGP sessions. Moreover, RRs may be present in the member ASs of 
   the confederation.  
   Confederations may be run with different sub-options. Regarding the 
   IGP, each member AS can run its own IGP or they can all share the 
   same IGP. Regarding BGP, local_pref may or may not cross the member 
   AS boundaries. 
   A solution should support the shutdown of eBGP sessions between 
   member-ASs in the confederation in addition to the shutdown of eBGP 
   sessions between a member-AS and an AS outside of the confederation.

                  ASBR2.1   
    
    
   In the above figure, member-AS AS1A, AS1B, AS1C belong to a 
   confederation of ASs in AS1. AS1A and AS1B are connected to AS2. 
    
   In normal operation, for the traffic toward AS2,  
   . AS1A sends the traffic directly to AS2 through ASBR1A.1 
   . AS1B sends the traffic directly to AS2 through ASBR1B.1 
   . AS1C load balances the traffic between AS1A and AS1B 
    
   When the session between ASBR1A.1 and ASBR2.1 undergoes 
   maintenance, it is required that all BGP routers of AS1 reroute 
   traffic to ASBR1B.1 before the session between ASBR1A.1 and 
   ASBR2.1 is shut down. 
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   Security considerations MUST be addressed by the proposed 
   solutions. 
    
   The solution SHOULD NOT increase the ability for one AS to 
   selectively influence routing decision in the peer AS (inbound 
   TE) outside the case of the BGP session shutdown. Otherwise, the 
   peer AS SHOULD have means to detect such behavior. 
    
8. IANA Considerations 
    
   This document has no actions for IANA.
