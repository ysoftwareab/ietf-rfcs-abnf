          DNS Delete-Confirm Mechanism With Multi-DHCP-Servers
                draft-que-dhc-dns-multi-dhcp-servers-00

Abstract

   Registering Self-generated IPv6 Addresses in DNS using DHCPv6
   describes a mechanism to register self-generated and statically
   configured addresses in DNS through a DHCPv6 server.  If there are
   multiple DHCPv6 servers within an administration domain, when the
   client extends the configuration, the coordination of multiple
   servers will be an important problem.  This document defines a
   mechanism to ensure that the servers can work correctly in updating
   DNS.

1.  Introduction

   In network that are centrally managed, self-generated and statically
   configured addresses can be registered through a DHCPv6 server.  When
   there are multiple DHCPv6 servers within an administration domain,
   the servers can work correctly in updating DNS (either adding or
   removing the entries).  If there are two address registration servers
   and both receive the initial registration and (correctly) update DNS,
   when the client extends this but one of the servers does not receive
   this extension.  Then, the server that missed the extension removes
   the entry prematurely (i.e., when it expired originally).

   This document defines a mechanism to ensure that the servers can
   coordinate with each other and update DNS correctly.  Two new DHCPv6
   message type is defined to confirm the address registration
   information.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Solution Overview

   After the servers update DNS correctly, the client SHOULD extends
   this by sending a new ADDR-REGISTRATION-CONFIRMATION message to a
   DHCPv6 address registration server.  After receiving the refresh
   message, the DHCPv6 address registration server update the address
   registration entry.  Before the servers that missed the extension
   remove the entry prematurely (i.e., when it expired originally), the
   server MUST send an ADDR-REGISTRATION-CONFIRMATION message to the
   client to confirm whether or not remove the entry.  The ADDR-
   REGISTRATION-VALIDATION message MUST be sent back to the server to
   indicate whether or not the server remove the address registration
   entry.

4.  New DHCPv6 Messages

   Two new DHCPv6 messages between the client and the server: DHCPv6
   ADDR-REGISTRATION-CONFIRMATION Message and DHCPv6 ADDR-REGISTRATION-
   VALIDATION Message are defined.This section describes the structures
   of these messages.

4.1.  DHCPv6 ADDR-REGISTRATION-CONFIRMATION Message

   Before the servers that missed the extension remove the entry
   prematurely, the DHCPv6 server sends an ADDR-REGISTRATION-
   CONFIRMATION message to a client to whether or not remove the entry.
   The format of the ADDR-REGISTRATION-REQUEST message is described as
   follows:

   The ADDR-REGISTRATION-CONFIRMATION message MUST contain server

   FQDN option [RFC4704].  The IA_NA option MUST contain the IPv6
   address of the server.  When the client receives the ADDR-
   REGISTRATION-CONFIRMATION message.

4.2.  DHCPv6 ADDR-REGISTRATION-VALIDATION Message

   When received the ADDR-REGISTRATION-CONFIRMATION message from the
   server, the client determines whether to remove the entry and sents
   ADDR-REGISTRATION-VALIDATION message to the server.  The format of
   the ADDR-REGISTRATION-VALIDATION message is described as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   options         Options carried in this message.

   If the binding entry is valid, ADDR-REGISTRATION-VALIDATION MUST
   contain the IA_NA option and the DHCPv6 FQDN option [RFC4704].  The
   IA_NA option MUST contain at least one IA Address option.  The valid-
   lifetime field of the IA Address option MUST be set to the period for
   which the client would like to register the binding in DNS.  If the
   binding entry is invalid, the client MUST NOT put any option in the
   ADDR-REGISTRATION-VALIDATION message.

5.  DHCPv6 Address Registration Confirmation Procedure

   If there are multiple DHCPv6 servers within an administration domain,
   when the client extends the configuration, one of the server MAY miss
   the extension and remove the binding entry by mistake.  Before the
   server removes the binding entry, the server MUST send ADDR-
   REGISTRATION-CONFIRMATION to confirm whether or not to remove the
   binding entry.

5.1.  DHCPv6 Address Registration Confirmation Request

   For every successful binding registration, the address registration
   server MUST record the IPv6-address-to-FQDN bindings and associated
   valid-lifetimes in its storage.

   The address registration client MUST refresh the registration before
   it expires (i.e. before the valid-lifetime of the IA address elapses)
   by sending a new ADDR-REGISTRATION-REQUEST to the address
   registration server.

   If the address registration server does not receive such a refresh
   and the valid-lifetime will pass, the address registration server
   sends ADDR-REGISTRATION-CONFIRMATION to the client.

   If the binding entry is valid, ADDR-REGISTRATION-VALIDATION MUST
   contain the IA_NA option and the DHCPv6 FQDN option.  If the binding
   entry is invalid, the client MUST NOT put any option in the ADDR-
   REGISTRATION-VALIDATION message.

5.2.  Registration Expiry and Refresh

   When the server receives the ADDR-REGISTRATION-VALIDATION message, if
   the option is null, then remove the IPv6-address-to-FQDN binding
   entry in DNS, also the local record.  But if the option contain the
   IA_NA option and the FQDN option, the server MUST refresh the
   registration.
