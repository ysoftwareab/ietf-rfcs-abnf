Abstract

   This document describes a list of DSCP value of hundreds service type
   in order to make a precise priority, which can be applied by
   differentiated traffic conditioning policies. A Routing optimization
   based on traffic identification is then proposed, which is to execute
   route selection with the information of both destination address and
   traffic value. This method can promote the network quality of
   transmission and finally achieve differentiated services.

1. Introduction

   o This Request for comments (RFC) responses to note differentiated
      service packets with unique DS code in IP header. Service
      differentiation is desired to accommodate heterogeneous
      application requirements and user expectations, and to permit
      differentiated pricing of Internet service.

   o The service differentiation architecture permits intermediate
      nodes to examine and change the value of the DSCP. This document
      presents a list of DSCP value of hundreds of service types, in
      order to make a precise priority, which can be applied by
      differentiated traffic conditioning policies. This document is
      intended to be read along with the differentiated service
      architecture [FRC2475].

2. Terminology

   This section gives a general conceptual overview of the terms used in
   this document. Some of these terms are more precisely defined in
   later sections of this document.

   Traffic Identification is a method which selects packets based on the
   content of transport layer or application layer of packet according
   to defined rules. Service the overall treatment of a defined subset
   of a customer's traffic within a DS domain or end-to-end.

3. DSCP Values of Differentiated Application

   When packet arrives at a router, it firstly be processed by the
   Traffic Identification module, and be noted a specific DSCP value as
   its application type. Then the router finds the next hop from the
   proper routing table which is used by packets with this DSCP value. A
   replacement header field, called the DS field, is defined, which is
   intended to supersede the existing definitions of the IPv4 TOS octet
   [RFC791] and the IPv6 Traffic Class octet [IPv6]. Six bits of the DS
   field are used as a codepoint (DSCP) to select the PHB (Per Hop
   Behavior) a packet experiences at each node. A Two-bit currently
   unused (CU) field is reserved and is defined as ECN Explicit
   Congestion Notification  by IETF. In this document, the CU field is
   used as an extension of DS field. The DS field structure is presented
   below:

            0     1   2   3   4   5   6   7

           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

           |         DSCP          |  CU   |

           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

           DSCP: differentiated services codepoint
           CU: currently unused

   If the DSCP value is higher, the traffic condition may be more
   efficient. Traffic Identification techniques, including port based on
   traffic connection behavior and network packet identification method
   based on machine learning, is an important foundation of many network
   monitoring management and control methods today. Differentiated
   Services have different priority requests in the network.
   For example, the security type applications need rapid and safe
   network environment, so these application services should be
   transferred in the first priority. As a result, they should be
   distributed a high DSCP value.

   Based on the different priority requests of the current applications,
   the DSCP value can be distributed as fellows:

4. Routing Based on Traffic Identification

   After the identification in the Traffic Identification module, each
   type of traffic is endowed with a certain DSCP value. In general,
   traffic with high priority has higher requirements for path
   parameters, and is consequently provided with a prior service.
   Furthermore, this module can be used as the basis of routing
   optimization, which in detail is to execute route selection with the
   information of both destination address and traffic value (embody the
   requirements of different application services) rather than with
   destination address only during the routing phase. In doing so, a
   user oriented characteristic is also reflected. For example, for
   traffic to the same destination, if the DSCP value of a certain kind
   of traffic is 0X10, which means this traffic is real-time stream and
   has very high demands on delay and bandwidths, then we can choose
   path with relative low latency; Whereas for those traffic to the same
   destination that consume considerable bandwidth, e.g. P2P traffic, we
   should select the best effort path. The performance of paths with low
   latency or best effort can be configured statically in advance.

   To provide different routes for different service, we need to sustain
   multi optional paths that reach the same destination in routing
   tables, which can be achieved by setting path parameters for each
   path. During the process searching routing table, the destination
   address is treated as the first index and the DSCP value of traffic
   is secondary, then we can find the forwarding hop one by one.

   Thus we can arrange routing according to different traffic
   requirements based on the route selection with destination, which can
   promote the network quality of transmission and finally achieve
   differentiated services.

5. Security Considerations

   Noting the packets with different DSCP value does not have any direct
   impact on security.

6. IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA considerations.
