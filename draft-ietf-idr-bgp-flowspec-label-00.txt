              Carrying Label Information for BGP FlowSpec
                  draft-ietf-idr-bgp-flowspec-label-00

Abstract

   This document specifies a method in which the label mapping
   information for a particular FlowSpec rule is piggybacked in the same
   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Update message that is used to
   distribute the FlowSpec rule.  Based on the proposed method, the
   Label Switching Routers (LSRs) (except the ingress LSR) on the Label
   Switched Path (LSP) can use label to indentify the traffic matching a
   particular FlowSpec rule; this facilitates monitoring and traffic
   statistics for FlowSpec rules.

1.  Introduction

   This section provides the background for proposing a new action for
   BGP Flow specification that push/pops MPLS or swaps MPLS tags.  For
   those familiar with BGP Flow specification ([RFC5575], [RFC7674],
   [I-D.ietf-idr-flow-spec-v6], [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-l2vpn],
   [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-flowspec-oid] and MPLS ([RFC3107]) can skip this
   background section.

1.1.  Background

   [RFC5575] defines the flow specification (FlowSpec) that is an
   n-tuple consisting of several matching criteria that can be applied
   to IP traffic.  The matching criteria can include elements such as
   source and destination address prefixes, IP protocol, and transport
   protocol port numbers.  A given IP packet is said to match the
   defined flow if it matches all the specified criteria.  [RFC5575]



Liang, et al.           Expires December 3, 2016                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft                BGP FlowSpec                     June 2016


   also defines a set of filtering actions, such as rate limit,
   redirect, marking, associated with each flow specification.  A new
   Border Gateway Protocol Network Layer Reachability Information (BGP
   NLRI) (AFI/SAFI: 1/133 for IPv4, AFI/SAFI: 1/134 for VPNv4) encoding
   format is used to distribute traffic flow specifications.

   [RFC3107] specifies the way in which the label mapping information
   for a particular route is piggybacked in the same Border Gateway
   Protocol Update message that is used to distribute the route itself.
   Label mapping information is carried as part of the Network Layer
   Reachability Information (NLRI) in the Multiprotocol Extensions
   attributes.  The Network Layer Reachability Information is encoded as
   one or more triples of the form <length, label, prefix>.  The NLRI
   contains a label is indicated by using Subsequent Address Family
   Identifier (SAFI) value 4.

   [RFC4364] describes a method in which each route within a Virtual
   Private Network (VPN) is assigned a Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) label.  If the Address Family Identifier (AFI) field is set to
   1, and the SAFI field is set to 128, the NLRI is an MPLS-labeled VPN-
   IPv4 address.

1.2.  MPLS Flow Specification Deployment

   In BGP VPN/MPLS networks when flow specification policy rules exist
   on multiple forwarding devices in the network bound with labels from
   one or more LSPs, only the ingress LSR (Label Switching Router) needs
   to identify a particular traffic flow based on the matching criteria
   for flow.  Once the flow is match by the ingress LSR, the ingress LSR
   steers the packet to a corresponding LSP (Label Switched Path).
   Other LSRs of the LSP just need to forward the packet according to
   the label carried in it.

2.  Terminology

   This section contains definitions of terms used in this document.

      Flow Specification (FlowSpec): A flow specification is an n-tuple
      consisting of several matching criteria that can be applied to IP
      traffic, including filters and actions.  Each FlowSpec consists of
      a set of filters and a set of actions.

3.  Overview of Proposal

   This document proposes adding a BGP-FS action in an extended
   community alters the label switch path associated with a matched
   flow.  If the match does not have a label switch path, this action is
   skipped.

Internet-Draft                BGP FlowSpec                     June 2016


   The BGP flow specification (BGP-FS) policy rule could match on the
   destination prefix and then utilize a BGP-FS action to adjust the
   label path associated with it (push/pop/swap tags.)  Or a BGP-FS
   policy rule could match on any set of BGP-FS match conditions
   associated with a BGP-FS action that adjust the label switch path
   (push/pop/swap).

   [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-mpls-match] provides a match BGP-FS that may
   be used with this action to match and direct MPLS packets.

   Example of Use:

   Forwarding information for the traffic from IP1 to IP2 in the
   Routers:

          PE1:   in(<IP2,IP1>) --> out(Label2)
          ASBR1: in(Label2) --> out(Label3)
          ASBR2: in(Label3) --> out(Label4)
          PE2:   in(Label4) --> out(--)

   Labels allocated by flow policy process:

          Label4 allocated by PE2
          Label3 allocated by ASBR2
          Label2 allocated by ASBR1

          Filters:

   The following Extended Communities are added/deleted

          [rule-1a] BGP-FS action MPLS POP [used on PE2]

4.  Protocol Extensions

   In this document, BGP is used to distribute the FlowSpec rule bound
   with label(s).  A new label-action is defined as BGP extended
   community value based on Section 7 of [RFC5575].

        +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+
        | type   | extended community | encoding                 |
        +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+
        | TBD1   | label-action       | MPLS tag                 |
        +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+

   Label-action is described below:

  0                   1                   2                   3
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

Internet-Draft                BGP FlowSpec                     June 2016


   The use and the meaning of these fields are as follows:

      Type: the same as defined in [RFC4360]

      OpCode: Operation code

   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+
   |OpCode| Function                                                   |
   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  0   | Push the MPLS tag                                          |
   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  1   | Pop the outermost MPLS tag in the packet                   |
   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  2   | Swap the MPLS tag with the outermost MPLS tag in the packet|
   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+
   | 3~15 | Reserved                                                   |
   +------+------------------------------------------------------------+

         When the Opcode field is set to 0, the label stack entry Should
         be pushed on the MPLS label stack.

         When the OpCode field is set to 1, the label stack entry is
         invalid, and the router SHOULD pop the existing outermost MPLS
         tag in the packet.

         When the OpCode field is set to 2, the router SHOULD swap the
         label stack entry with the existing outermost MPLS tag in the
         packet.  If the packet has no MPLS tag, it just pushes the
         label stack entry.

         The OpCode 0 or 1 may be used in some SDN networks, such as the
         scenario described in
         [I-D.filsfils-spring-segment-routing-central-epe].

         The OpCode 2 can be used in traditional BGP MPLS/VPN networks.

      Reserved: all zeros.

      Order: A FlowSpec rule MAY include one or more ordering label-
      action(s).  If multiple label action extended communities are
      associated with a BGP-FS Rule, this gives the order of this in the
      list.  The Last action received for an order will be used.

      Label: the same as defined in [RFC3032].

      Bottom of Stack (S): the same as defined in [RFC3032].  It SHOULD
      be invalid, and set to zero by default.  It MAY be modified by the
      forwarding router locally.

Internet-Draft                BGP FlowSpec                     June 2016


      Time to Live (TTL): the same as defined in[RFC3032].  It MAY be
      modified by the forwarding router locally.

      Experimental Use (Exp): the same as defined in [RFC3032].  It MAY
      be modified by the forwarding router according to the local
      routing policy.

5.  IANA Considerations

   For the purpose of this work, IANA should allocate the following
   Extended community:

      TBD1 for label-action

6.  Security considerations

   This extension to BGP does not change the underlying security issues
   inherent in the existing BGP.
