Internet-Draft               IAOC Membership                   July 2009


1.  Introduction

   The original specification of the membership of the IAOC in BCP 101
   [1] included the IETF and IAB Chairs as voting members.  While
   probably desirable initially, this has turned out to have unfortunate
   side effects.  This document discusses those side effects and
   replaces those specific individuals with liaisons from the IAB and
   IESG.


2.  The IAB and IETF Chairs and the IAOC

   While BCP 101 specified that the IAB and IETF Chairs should serve on
   the IAOC (and now as Trustees of the Internet Trust [2]), there does
   not appear to be a strong motivation for having those particular
   roles expanded to include the considerable additional workload that
   comes with the IAOC and Trustee roles.  It is clearly important that
   the IAOC and Trustees have direct and ongoing input from the IAB and
   IESG, but that responsibility need not be performed by the two
   Chairs.  There are disadvantages associated with having the Chairs in
   the Trustee and IAOC roles, which include:

   o  workload and full-time positions
      Even without IAOC and Trustee roles, the IETF Chair and IAB Chair
      roles require considerable time and effort.  It is in the interest
      of the community to minimize that time and effort because doing so
      increases the number of people who might be able to volunteer to
      serve in those positions and because it might permit those who do
      serve to participate more actively in other tasks.

   o  skill set
      The IAOC and Trustee roles ideally require special skills and
      experience in administration, finance, organizational management,
      and intellectual property issues.  Those skills have not been high
      priorities in selection of either IESG and IAB members or the two
      Chairs.  The bodies involved should be able to select the people
      from among their members with the greatest level of skill,
      interest, and time availability for these roles.

   In addition, it is useful to clarify the role of the IAB and IESG
   representatives by making them (and the chairs, if different) non-
   voting liaisons.  This reduces the requirement that IAB and/or IESG
   members be selected for the specific types of expertise needed on the
   IAOC and Trustees.  If they cannot explain IESG and IAB requirements
   and perspectives to the voting IAOC and Trustee members and persuade
   them as needed, we have far more serious problems than whether or not
   those two people vote.

3.  BCP 101 Modifications

   Section 4 of BCP 101 is hereby modified as follows:

3.1.  Editorial changes for clarity

   1.  Immediately below the title line for Section 4 ("IAOC Membership,
       Selection and Accountability"), insert a new Section title, "4.1
       Voting Members".

   2.  Immediately below the line starting "o The ISOC President""
       insert a new Section title, "4.2 Non-voting Members and Other
       Liaisons"

   3.  Immediately after the sentence ending "...IAOC has requested the
       liaison.", insert a new Section title, "4.3 Other Membership
       Issues".

   4.  Renumber the additional subsections of Section 4 as appropriate.

3.2.  Substantive Changes

   Modify the material in Section 4 of BCP 101 (Section 4.1 as defined
   above), by deleting:

   o  The IETF Chair (ex officio);

   o  The IAB Chair (ex officio);

   and adding at the beginning of Section 4.2 as defined above:

   o  One non-voting liaison from each of the IAB and IESG.  These
      liaisons will normally be chosen from the memberships of those
      bodies although, should the bodies decide to do so and can arrange
      the necessary communication paths, someone else can be chosen.
      The chairs of the respective bodies are not barred from serving
      should those bodies decide that is appropriate, except that the
      IETF Chair may not represent the IAB.  These liaisons are
      considered to be IAOC Members and hence "eligible parties" from
      the standpoint of the IETF Trust and may not be excluded from any
      meeting of the IAOC or Trustees, even executive sessions.
      Individuals serve in these positions at the pleasure of the IAB
      and IESG respectively; those bodies should review the positions at
      least annually at a convenient time after new members are seated.

   o  If one or both of the liaisons specified immediately above are not
      the IAB Chair or IETF Chair, those individuals have permanent
      liaison status with the IAOC (and Trustees): they are not expected

      to attend meetings on a regular basis, but may do so and may not
      be excluded from any meeting, even executive sessions.


4.  Transition

   The changes specified in this document are effective immediately at
   the time of its adoption.  Since the Chairs are now serving in the
   specified roles and eligible to continue, the IESG and IAB should
   review the positions at times of their choosing.


5.  Acknowledgments

   This document benefited from suggestions from Spencer Dawkins and
   Joel Halpern.  Neither bears responsibility for the specifics of the
   approach mentioned above.


6.  IANA Considerations

   [[Comment.1: RFC Editor: Please remove this section before
   publication.]]

   This memo includes no requests to or actions for IANA.


7.  Security Considerations

   This document makes an adjustment to an IETF and IASA procedural
   document.  It has no Internet security implications beyond those
   described in the relevant base documents.
