1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.16d/e [IEEE802.16][IEEE802.16e] supports MSs (Mobile
   Stations) moving at vehicular speeds and thereby specifies a system
   for combined fixed and mobile broadband wireless access.

   As the deployment of IEEE 802.16 networks progresses, the IEEE 802.16
   MSs will be connected to IPv6 networks.  The characteristics of IEEE
   802.16 networks put special considerations on how IPv6 is used.  This
   document describes scenarios and considerations on IPv6 adoption in
   IEEE 802.16 networks.

1.1.  Scope of this Document

   This document presents issues with discussion on the use of IPv6
   protocols when operating over IEEE 802.16 networks.  In order to
   achieve this, operational, architectural, and addressing scenarios
   are first described.  The scenarios have an influence on how to adopt
   IPv6 to IEEE 802.16 networks.  Then, the following considerations
   will be intensively discussed based on the scenarios :

   Basic IP

      In this part, basic IPv6 issues such as Neighbor Discovery, IPv6
      packet transmission, addressing, and IPv6 control/management
      protocols are discussed.

   Mobility

      In this part, issues on interworking with the link layer mobility
      mechanism and Mobile IPv6 are discussed.

   Multicast

      In this part, MBS and IPv6 multicast interworking issues are
      discussed.

   Security

      In this part, IPsec and threat model issues are discussed.

   Multiple Interface with Different Characteristics

      In this part, some requirements for multiple interfaces with
      differerent characteristics (e.g., WLAN) are discussed.

1.2.  Terminology

   SS:

      Subscriber Station.  A general equipment set providing
      connectivity between subscriber equipment and a BS.

   MS:

      Mobile Station.  A station in the mobile service intended to be
      used while in motion or during halts at unspecified points.  A
      mobile station (MS) is always a subscriber station (SS) unless
      specifically excepted otherwise in this document.

   BS:

      Base Station.  A generalized equipment set providing connectivity,
      management and control of MS connections.  A unidirectional
      mapping between BS and MS medium access control (MAC) peers for
      the purpose of transporting a service flow's traffic.  Connections
      are identified by a connection identifier (CID).  All traffic is
      carried on a connection.

   CID:

      Connection IDentifier.  A 16-bit value that identifies a
      connection to equivalent peers in the MAC of the BS and the MS.
      It maps to a service flow identifier (SFID), which also defines
      QoS parameters of the service flow associated with that
      connection.

   MBS:

      Multicast and Broadcast Services.  Some globally defined service
      flows may carry broadcast or multicast information that should be
      delivered to a multiple of SSs or MSs.

1.3.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Assumptions and Scenarios

   IEEE 802.16e supports two modes such as 2-way PMP (Point-to-
   Multipoint) and Mesh topology wireless networks.  In this document,
   we focus on 2-way PMP topology wireless networks.

   Some of the problems with IPv6 adoption in IEEE 802.16 networks are
   described in [I-D.jee-ipv6-802.16-problem-statement].  In this
   section, several issues about the operation and the architecture of
   IEEE 802.16e networks are addressed.  The issues have an influence on
   how to adopt IPv6 to IEEE 802.16 networks.

2.1.  Deployment Models

   From an operational perspective, there are two use cases of IEEE
   802.16 standards.

2.1.1.  Hot Zone

   The success of a Hotspot service with IEEE 802.11 has been prominent.
   The new IEEE 802.16 standards basically support such Hotspot services
   with large coverage area and high data rate.  An area served by one
   base station is usually termed 'Hot Zone' because it is considerably
   larger than an IEEE 802.11 access point service area called Hotspot.
   Large numbers of wireless Internet service providers (Wireless ISPs)
   have planned to use IEEE 802.16 for the purpose of high quality
   service.  A company can use IEEE 802.16 to build up mobile office.
   Wireless Internet spreading through a campus or a cafe can be also
   implemented with it.  The distinct point of this use case is that it
   can use unlicensed (2.4 & 5 GHz) band as well as licensed (2.6 &
   3.5GHz) band.  By using the unlicensed band, the IEEE 802.16 BS might
   be used just as a wireless hub which a user purchases to build a
   private wireless network in his/her home or laboratory.

   Under 'Hot Zone' use case, the IEEE 802.16 BS will be deployed using
   an Ethernet (IP) backbone rather than a proprietary backend like
   cellular systems.  Thus, many IPv6 functionalities will be preserved
   when adopting IPv6 to IEEE 802.16 devices.

2.1.2.  Cellular-like

   IEEE 802.16 BS can offer both fixed communications and mobile
   functions unlike IEEE 802.11.  In particular, IEEE 802.16e working
   group has been standardizing the mobility features.  The final
   specification of IEEE 802.16e will provide some competition to the
   existing cellular systems.  This use case will be implemented only
   with the licensed spectrum.  IEEE 802.16 BS might be deployed with a
   proprietary backend managed by an operator.  All original IPv6

Internet-Draft        IPv6 in IEEE 802.16 Networks         February 2006


   functionalities will not survive and some of them might be
   compromised to efficiently serve IPv6 to this 'Cellular-like' use
   case.

   Under the use case, however, IEEE 802.16 standards are still IP-
   centric, providing packet-switched approach, while cellular standards
   like GSM have a more circuit-switched approach.

2.2.  BS Architecture

   We describe two possible deployment architectures of IEEE 802.16
   networks.  Figure 1 and 2 illustrate the two cases.

2.2.1.  Router Separation from BS

   In Figure 1, routers are located separated with IEEE 802.16 BSs.  In
   this case, IEEE 802.16 BSs have only MAC and PHY layers without
   router function.  A router and several BSs form an IPv6 subnet.  BSs
   may not have IPv6 stack.  But, for management and configuration
   purpose, IPv6 stack will be loaded to them.  A simple or complex
   network equipments may constitute the underlying wired network
   between BSs and router.  In a subnet, therefore, there are always two
   underlying links including IEEE 802.16 wireless link between MS and
   BS.

   In this case, the methods of IPv6 adoption to IEEE 802.16 may depend
   on the underlying network architecture between BSs and router.

   Note that this draft does not address this scenario at this phase.
   Its considerations will be discussed later.

2.2.2.  BS and Router in One Box

   Figure 2 represents an alternative IEEE 802.16 network deployment
   where a BS is integrated with a router, composing one box in view of
   implementation.  A subnet consists of only single router and single
   BS.

   In this case, many IPv6 functionalities can be implemented without
   much consideration about the underlying network implementation.  Only
   IEEE 802.16 link will be taken into consideration for IPv6 adoption.

   one box

2.3.  Addressing Issues

   There are two possible addressing schemes as follows.

2.3.1.  A Unique Prefix to a MS

   RFC 3314 recommends that a given prefix should be assigned to only
   one primary PDP context so that 3GPP terminals are allowed to
   generate multiple IPv6 address using the prefix without the concerns
   of address confliction.  This recommendation can be also applied to
   IEEE 802.16 network system if it is reasonable to the given usage
   scenario (e.g., 'Cellular-like' usage scenario).  In such case, many
   IPv6 functionalities can be implemented without difficulty.

Internet-Draft        IPv6 in IEEE 802.16 Networks         February 2006


2.3.2.  A Single Prefix to Attached MSs

   Different usage scenario such as 'Hot zone' would not allow RFC 3314
   recommendation because of the compatibility with the existing IPv6
   devices.  In this case, there will be more issues for adopting IPv6
   to IEEE 802.16.

2.4.  Convergence Sublayer (CS) Types

   IEEE 802.16 Convergence Sublayer (CS) provides the tunneling of
   IP(v6) packets over IEEE 802.16 air-link.  The tunnels are identified
   by the Connection Identifier (CID).  Generally, CS performs the
   following functions in terms of IP packet transmission: 1) Receipt of
   protocol data units (PDUs) from the higher layer, 2) Performing
   classification and CID mapping of the PDUs, 3) Delivering the PDUs to
   the appropriate MAC SAP, 4) Receipt of PDUs from the peer MAC SAP.

   [IEEE802.16] defines several CSs for carrying IP packets, but does
   not provide a detailed description of how to carry them.  The several
   CSs are classified into two types of CS: IP CS and Ethernet CS.  The
   followings include the description of the two types.

2.4.1.  IP Convergence Sublayer (CS)

   Using IP CS, an IEEE 802.16 MAC frame is followed by IPv6 header.
   That is, IP CS only carries IP packets as the payloads of IEEE 802.16
   MAC frame.  In terms of IP layer, therefore, the link-layer addresses
   of IPv6 neighbors are not utilized at all.  Accordingly, it is not
   easy (or even needless) to support address resolution, router
   discovery, and address auto-configuration, etc.  With IP CS, the
   classification and CID mapping will be performed based on destination
   IP address, source IP address, destination port, and source port.
   Sometimes, the QoS-related fields of IPv6 header such as 'class' and
   'flow label' may be additionally used for QoS and prioritization
   purposes.

   IP CS is adequate to support the point-to-point type of communication
   between a SS and a BS/Router when the next-hop of the outbound
   packets sent by a SS is pre-defined and fixed to a network node, such
   as BS or access router.  At this case, it is not well-grounded to
   support all IPv6-related function.  Rather, some functions will be
   implemented in a proprietary manner.

   IP CS does not require any header to carry a link-layer address, it
   can save some bandwidth of IEEE 802.16 air-link.

Internet-Draft        IPv6 in IEEE 802.16 Networks         February 2006


2.4.2.  Ethernet Convergence Sublayer (CS)

   [IEEE802.16] introduces 'IPv6(v4)-over-ethernet CS' which permits
   classifiers that examine fields in Ethernet headers as well as fields
   of IPv6 (and encapsulated TCP/UDP headers) that are encapsulated in
   IEEE 802.3-style frames.  An IEEE 802.16 MAC frame is followed by
   IEEE 802.3 Ethernet header, which then followed by IP header.  This
   type of CS can well support IEEE 802-style broadcast network service.
   The emulation of the broadcast network with Ethernet CS can allow IP
   layer to see an IEEE 802.16 link as a LAN and support IPv6 neighbor
   discovery (ND) protocol without difficulty.  Ethernet CS can also
   support point-to-point service via PPPoE optionally.

   Since additional IEEE 802.3 Ethernet header is always located between
   IEEE 802.16 MAC frame and IPv6 header, some overload over IEEE 802.16
   air-link is inevitable.  But, it can be alleviated by using IEEE
   802.16 Payload Header Suppression.

   For the detailed description of Ethernet CS, see [I-D-mandin-ip-over-
   80216-ethcs].

2.5.  Summary of Scenarios

   As a result of the combination of the above four issues, we got 16
   scenarios as follows.

3.  Basic IP

3.1.  Neighbor Discovery for IPv6

   In IEEE 802.16 networks, some Neighbor Discovery [RFC2461] messages
   can be unnecessary in certain cases, since MS and BS/router links
   resemble a point-to-point link; hence, the MS's only neighbor is the
   the BS/router which is already known through the link configuration
   (e.g., network entry) mechanisms.  Also, Neighbor Discovery packets
   with a multicast destination address (e.g., all-node-multicast, or
   all-router-multicast addresses) are also transmitted as normal IEEE
   802.16 MAC frames, as the same as regular unicast packets.  Normal
   802.16 MAC headers do not include MAC addresses.  Instead, in order
   to identify connections to equivalent peers in the MAC of the BS/
   router and the MS, CID is used.  In certain cases, multicast CID may
   be provided for in the downlink.  It can be useful to tranmit
   efficiently link-local multicast destination packets (e.g, Router
   Advertisements) from BS/router to MSs.  The packet transmission
   issues are discussed in section 3.2.

   In some scenarios, the router may be separated from the BS.  Two
   different link connections must be bridged for one network connection
   between and the MS and the router (e.g., 802.16 link + Ethernet).  In
   case of the scenarios, the operations and issues may be different
   (i.e., CID mapping and Neighbor Discovery packets transmission).
   These issues will be discussed later.

   Note that considerations of Neighbor Discovery in IEEE 802.16
   networks are being discussed in an other document [I-D.lee-ndp-
   ieee802.16].

   Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement messages can be
   classified into three functions; Address Resolution, Neighbor
   Unreachabilit Detection and Duplcate Address Detection.  Also, Router
   Solicitation and Router Advertisement messages are used for Router
   and Prefix Discovery.

3.1.1.  Address Resolution

   Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement messages for address
   resolution delivered between the MS and BS/router are not needed,
   since MS and BS/router links resemble a point-to-point link; hence,
   the MS's only neighbor is the BS/router which is already known
   through the link configuration (e.g., network entry) mechanisms.
   Actually, Neighbor Cache entries may be unnecessary.  Since CID is
   used for link-layer transmission, CID connection state is maintained,
   instead of Neighbor Cache entries.  The MS uses CID which is provided
   to each connection by the BS/router.  It must ensure the uniqueness



Shin, et al.             Expires August 30, 2006               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft        IPv6 in IEEE 802.16 Networks         February 2006


   of such connections on the link.

3.1.2.  Neighbor Unreachability Detection

   In general, Neighbor Unreachability Detection is used for all paths
   between hosts and neighboring nodes.  However, this function is used
   only between MS and BS/router, since the MS's only neighbor is the
   BS/router.

   The Neighbor Unreachability Detection portion of IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery protocol is not needed, since MS and BS/router don't
   maintain Neighbor Cache entries.  But the MS and BS/router must know
   their neighbor reachability at the IP layer in certain cases.  A BS/
   router is considered reachable if the MS has recently received a
   confirmation that packets sent recently to the neighbor were received
   by its IP layer.  Reachability confirmation can be gathered in two
   ways: hints from upper layer protocols that indicate a connection is
   making "forward progress", or from link layer mechanisms that
   indicate a "link up" in IEEE 802.16 networks.

3.1.3.  Duplcate Address Detection

   Usually, a BS/router may assign a prefix that is unique to a MS.
   Therefore, this avoids the necessity to perform Duplicate Address
   Detection.  The allocation of a prefix to a MS will alow the MSs to
   implement the IPv6 stateless address auto-configuration [RFC2462] and
   privacy extension [RFC3041] without the need for further Duplicate
   Address Detection.

   However, if BS/router assigns a single prefix to all of its attached
   MSs, Duplicate Address Detection must send Neighbor Solicitation
   messages with an unspecified source address targeting its own
   tentative address.  In order to efficiently perform a multicast
   Neighbor Advertisement for a response, a BS/router can perform proxy
   Neighbor Advertisements for one or more other MSs.  In certain cases,
   multicast CID may be used to send the proxy Neighbor Advertisements
   to the MSs in the downlink.

   It might be dependent on the scenarios of IPv6 addressing scenarios
   described in section 2.3.  This issus is also discussed in section
   3.3.

3.1.4.  Router and Prefix Discovery

   Router Discovery is already performed by link layer configuration
   mechanisms.  As for Prefix Discovery, a BS/router trasmits Router
   Advertisements that contain Prefix Information to the advertising
   interface whose corresponding AdvSendAdvertisements flag is TRUE.



Shin, et al.             Expires August 30, 2006               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        IPv6 in IEEE 802.16 Networks         February 2006


   The AdvSendAdvertisements flag must be set when CID is set for a
   connection.  A BS/router must not send Router Advertisements out to
   any interface that is not an advertising interface.  In this case, a
   multicast CID can be used to to transmit the Router Advertisements to
   the MSs in the downlink.

   To obtain Router Advertisements quickly, a MS can send Router
   Solicitations to its BS/router.  In this case, the MS's CID is used
   to identify the MS.

3.1.5.  Redirect Function

   The Redirect message is not necessary in IEEE 802.16 networks, since
   the MS's only router is the BS/router and the MS cannot send a packet
   to other MS without the BS/router.

3.2.  Transmission of IPv6 Packets

   IEEE 802.16 MAC header format is described in [IEEE802.16].

         0                   1
         0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |H|E|   Type    |R|C|EKS|R|LEN  |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |    LEN LSB    |    CID MSB    |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |    CID LSB    |    HCS        |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   Figure 4: IEEE 802.16 MAC header format

   It is importmant to see that there is no MAC address in IEEE 802.16
   the MAC header format.  Similar to general point-to-point links, the
   MAC address is not used for link-layer transmission.  Hence, mapping
   unicast or multicast addresses to IEEE 802.16 MAC addresses is
   unnecessary.  Also, link-local addressess may be not needed for
   transmission of link-local destination packets.  Instead, CID is used
   to identify connections to equivalent peers in the MAC of the BS and
   the MS in IEEE 802.16 networks.

   In some scenarios, the router may be separated from the BS.  Two
   different link connections must be bridged for one network connection
   between and the MS and the router (e.g., 802.16 link + Ethernet).  In
   these cases, standard Path MTU Disovery may not work well.  These
   issues is being discussed in [I-D.shin-16ng-ipv6-transmission].

   In certain cases, multicast CID can be provided for in the downlink.
   It can be useful to transmit efficiently link-local multicast
   destination packets in the downlink.

3.3.  IPv6 Addressing

   There are two possiblities to allocate an IPv6 prefix in 802.16
   networks.  The simple method is to assign a unique prefix to a MS.
   This avoids the necessity to perform Duplicate Address Detection.

   The second method is to assign a single prefix to all of its attached
   MSs.  In this case, Duplicate Address Detection must be supported.

   It might be dependent on the scenarios of the IPv6 addressing model.
   This issus should be intensively researched later, since it will
   affect the protocol implementation of Duplicate Address Detection.

4.  Mobility

   As for mobility management, the movement between BSs is handled by
   Mobile IPv6 [RFC3775], if it requires a subnet change.  Also, in
   certain cases (e.g., fast handover [I-D.ietf-mipshop-fast-mipv6]) the
   link mobility information must be available for facilitating layer 3
   handoff procedure.

4.1.  Mobile IPv6

   Mobile IPv6 defines that movement detection uses Neighbor
   Unreachability Detection to detect when the default router is no
   longer bi-directionally reachable, in which case the mobile node must
   discover a new default router.  Periodic Router Advertisements for
   rechability and movement detection may be unnecessary becasue IEEE
   802.16 MAC provides the reachabilty by the Ranging procedure and the
   movement detection by the Handoff procedure.

4.2.  Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers

   In addition, IEEE 802.16 defines L2 triggers whether refresh of a IP
   address is required during the handoff.  Though a handoff has
   occurred, an additional Router Discovery procedure is not required in
   case of intra-subnet handoff.  Also, faster handoff may be occurred
   by the L2 trigger in case of inter-subnet handoff.

   Also, IEEE 802.16g which is under-developed defines L2 triggers for
   link status auch as link-up, link-down, handoff-start.  These L2
   triggers may make the mobile IPv6 procedure more efficient and
   faster.  In addition, Mobile IPv6 Fast Handover assumes the support
   from link-layer technology, but the particular link-layer information
   being available, as well as the timing of its availability (before,
   during or after a handover has occurred), differs according to the
   particular link-layer technology in use.

   This issue is also being dicussed in [I-D.jang-mipshop-fh80216e].

5.  Multicast

   In order to support multicast services in IEEE 802.16, Multicast
   Listener Discovery [RFC2710] must be supported between the MS and BS/
   router.  Also, interworking with IP multicast protocols and MBS
   should be considered.

5.1.  Multicast Listener Discovery

   Within IEEE 802.16 networks, a MS connects to its BS/router via
   point-to-point links.  Multicast Listener Discovery sends link-local
   multicast destination queries and reports.  The packets are
   transmitted as normal IEEE 802.16 MAC frames, as the same as regular
   unicast packets.  Especially, multicast CIDs can be used to transmit
   efficiently query packets on the downlink.

   There are exactly two IP devices connected to the point-to-point
   link, and no attempt is made (at the link-layer) to suppress the
   forwarding of multicast traffic.  Consequently, sending Multicast
   Listener Discovery reports for link-local addresses in IEEE 802.16
   network environment may not always be necessary.  Multicast Listener
   Discovery is needed for multicast group knowledge that is not link-
   local.

5.2.  Interworking with IP Multicast and MBS

   MBS defines Multicast and Broadcast Services, but actually, MBS seems
   to be a broadcast service, not multicasting.  MBS adheres to
   broadcast services, while taditional IP multicast schemes define
   multicast routing using a shared tree or source-specific tree to
   deliver packets efficiently.

   In IEEE 802.16 networks, two types of access to multicast and
   broadcast services (MBS) may be supported: single-BS access and
   multi-BS access.  Therefore, these two types of services may be
   roughly mapped into Source-Specific Multicast.

   It should be intensively researched later, since MBS will be one of
   the killer services in IEEE 802.16 networks.

6.  Security

6.1.  IPsec

   IPsec is a fundamental part of IPv6.  Unlike IPv4, IPsec for IPv6 may
   be used within the global end-to-end architecture.  But, we don't
   have PKIs across organizations and IPsec isn't integrated with IEEE
   802.16 network mobility management.

6.2.  Security Threat Analysis

   IEEE 802.16 network threats may be different with IPv6 and IPv6
   transition threat models [I-D.ietf-v6ops-security-overview].  It will
   be discussed later.

7.  Multiple Interfaces with Different Properties

   If a MS has additional interfaces on which IP is used (such as
   Ethernet, WLAN), then there may be additional problems for the
   device.

   Some of these problems are :

   Protocol inconsitancy problems with the same fuctionalities:

      If an MS has additional interfaces on which IP is used, we need to
      figure out any protocol inconsitancy if there are protocol issues
      (modification) in IEEE 802.16 networks.  Two or more different
      versions of protocols (e.g., NDP) may be required within the
      TCP/IP stack on the same MS.

   Roaming/movement problems between heterogenous networks:

      will be discussed later.

   MS multi-homing problems:

      will be discussed later.
