2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five
   major components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and
        events for the purpose of management. The first
        version of this Structure of Management Information
        (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, RFC
        1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58,
        RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management
        information. The first version of the SNMP message
        protocol is called SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC
        1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
        protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC
        1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management
        information. The first set of protocol operations and
        associated PDU formats is described in STD 15, RFC
        1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations and
        associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC
        2573 [14] and the view-based access control mechanism
        described in RFC 2575 [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [18].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
   store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined
   in the SMI.

Internet Draft    Policy-Based Management MIB    July 12, 2000


   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the
   SMIv2. A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced
   through the appropriate translations. The resulting
   translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except
   where objects or events are omitted because no translation
   is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.
   However, this loss of machine readable information is not
   considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

3.  Overview

Large IT organizations have developed management strategies to cope
with the extraordinarily large scale inherent in large networks. In
particular, they try to manage the network as a whole by describing
and implementing high-level business policies, rather than managing
device by device, where orders of magnitude more decisions (and
mistakes) may be made.

Following this management practice results in the following benefits:
  - Reduced training needs (fewer details to learn)
  - Reduced documentation costs (fewer details to document)
  - Reduced impact of turnover (less ad-hoc knowledge goes out the door)
  - Greater testability (a greater percentage of fielded
    configurations may be tested in the lab)
  - Higher reliability (combination of factors above)
  - Lower cost of changes (changes can be simpler and operate over a
    wider extent)
  - Lower cost of corporate mergers (less knowledge to transfer; fewer
    policies to integrate)
  - Lower cost of ownership (combination of factors above)

To illustrate the concept of "business policies", some examples are:
  - All routers will run code version 6.2
  - On-site contracters will all have special security restrictions on
    their ports
  - All voice over cable ports in California must provide free local
    calling
  - Apply special forwarding to all ports whose customers have paid
    for premium service.

Each of these policies could represent an action applied to hundreds
of thousands of configuration variables.

In order to automate this practice, customers need software tools that
will implement business policies across their network, as well as
a standard protocol that will ensure that it can be applied to all of
their devices, regardless of the vendor.

This practice is called Policy-Based Network Management. This document
defines standard managed objects for the Simple Network Management
Protocol that are used to distribute policies in a standard form
throughout the network.

4.  Policy-Based Management Architecture

Policy-based network management is the practice of applying management
operations globally on all managed objects that share certain
attributes.

Policies always express a notion of:
  if (an object has certain characteristics) then (apply operation to
  that object)

Policies take the following normal form:

  if (policyFilter) then (policyAction)

A policyFilter is an expression which results in a boolean
to determine whether or not an object is a member of a set of
objects upon which an action is to be performed.

A policyAction is an operation performed on a set of objects.

These policies are executed on managed devices, where the objects live
(and thus their characteristics may be easily inspected), and where
operations on those objects will be performed.

A management station is responsible for distributing an organization's
policies to all of the managed devices in the infrastructure. The
pmPolicyTable provides managed objects for sending a policy to a
managed device.

In this architecture, the objects that policies act on are called
elements. An element is a group of related MIB variables such as all
the variables for interface #7. This enables policies to be expressed
more efficiently and concisely. Elements can also model circuits,
CPUs, queues, processes, systems, etc.

The execution model for policies on a managed device is:

  foreach element for which policyFilter returns true
      execute policyAction on that element

For example:

  If (interface is fast ethernet)       then (apply full-duplex mode)
  If (interface is access)              then (apply security filters)
  If (gold service paid for on circuit) then (apply special queueing)

Internet Draft    Policy-Based Management MIB    July 12, 2000


PolicyFilters have the capability of performing comparison operations
on SNMP variables, logical expressions, and other functions. Many
device characteristics are already defined in MIBs and are
easy to include in policyFilter expressions (ifType == ethernet,
frCircuitCommittedBurst < 128K, etc). However, there are
important characteristics that aren't currently in MIB objects, and
worse, it is not current practice to store this information on managed
devices. Therefore, this document defines MIB objects for this
information. To meet today's needs there are three missing areas:
roles, capabilities and time.

Roles

A role is an abstract characteristic assigned to an element that
expresses a notion, such as a political, financial, legal,
geographical, or architectural attribute, typically not directly
derivable from information stored on the managed system. For example,
"paid for premium service" or "is plugged into a UPS" are examples of
roles, whereas the percent utilization of a link would not be.

The types of information one would put into a role are:

  political - describes the role of a person or group of people, or of
              a service that a group of people use. Examples:
              executive, sales, outside-contracter, customer.
        If (attached user is executive) then (apply higher bandwidth)
        If (attached user is outside-contracter) then (restrict access)

  financial/legal - describes what financial consideration was
                    received. Could also include contractual or legal
                    considerations. Examples:
                    paid, gold, free, trial, demo, lifeline
                    (The lifeline example is supposed to model the
                    RBOC's legal obligation to provide dial tone to
                    elderly/poor).
        If (gold service paid for) then (apply special queueing)

  geographical - describes the location of an element. Examples:
                 California, Headquarters, insecure conduit.
        If (interface leaves the building) then (apply special security)

  architectural - describes the network architects "intent" for an
                  element. For example: backup, trunk.
         If (interface is backup) then (set ifAdminStatus = down)

Internet Draft    Policy-Based Management MIB    July 12, 2000


  Collectively, these 4 classes of characteristics are called
  roles. Roles are human defined strings that can be referenced by
  a policyFilter. Multiple roles may be assigned to each element.

Capabilities

  Some actions are inappropriate for certain elements or are simply
  unsupported. PolicyFilter's must be able to be defined so that a
  policy can be applied only to elements that have the proper
  capability. The capabilities table provides MIB objects that
  describe the capabilities of the system.

Time

  Managers may wish to define policies that are true for certain
  periods of time. This might mean that a policy is downloaded and is
  dormant for a period of time, becomes active, and then later becomes
  inactive. Sometimes these time periods will be regular (M-F 9-5) and
  sometimes ad-hoc. This MIB provides MIB objects that allow
  policies to be dependent on time.


5.  Policy Based Management Execution Environment

There are several steps performed in order to execute policies
in this environment:

    - Element Discovery
    - Element Filtering
    - Policy Enforcement


5.1.  Element Discovery

An element is a uniquely addressable entity on a managed
device. Examples of elements include interfaces, circuits,
queues, CPUs, and processes. Sometimes various attributes of
an entity will be described through tables in several standard
and proprietary MIBs - as long as the indexing is consistent
between these tables, the entity can be modeled as 1 element.
For example, the ifTable and the dot3Stats table both contain
attributes of interfaces and share the same index (ifIndex),
therefore they can be modeled as one element type.

The Element Type Registration table is used for the manager to

Internet Draft    Policy-Based Management MIB    July 12, 2000


learn what element types are being managed by the system and
to register new types if necessary. An element type is
registered by providing the OID of an SNMP object (i.e.,
without the instance). Each SNMP instance that exists under
that object is a distinct element. The address of the element
is the index part of the discovered OID. This address will be
supplied to policy filters and actions so that these scripts
can inspect and configure the element.

For each element that is discovered, the policy filter is
called with the element address as an argument to see if the
element is a member of the set that the policy acts upon.


5.1.1.  Implementation Notes

Note that while the external behavior of this registration
process is defined in terms of the walking of MIB tables,
implementation strategies may differ. For example, commonly-
used element types (like interface) may have purpose-built
element discovery capability built-in and advertised to
managers through an entry in the pmElementTypeRegTable.

Before registering an element type, it is the responsibility
of a manager to inspect the table and see if it is already
registered (by the agent or another manager). Note that
entries that differ only in the last OID (which specifies
which object in an entry) are effectively duplicates and
should be treated as such by the manager.

The system which implements the Policy-Based Management MIB
may not have knowledge of the format of object identifiers in
other MIBs. Therefore it is inappropriate for it to check
these OIDs for errors. It is the responsibility of the
management station to register well-formed object-identifiers.
For example, if an extra sub-identifier is supplied when
registering the ifTable, no elements will be discovered.
Similarly, if a sub-identifier is missing, every element will
be discovered numerous times (once per column) and none of the
element addresses will be well-formed.

Internet Draft    Policy-Based Management MIB    July 12, 2000


5.2.  Element Filtering

The first step in executing a policy is to see which elements
match the policy filter. To evaluate a policy, the policy
filter is called once for each element and runs to completion.
The element address is the only state that is passed to the
script for each invocation (in particular, no state is
remembered from the previous invocation of this element nor
from the previous invocation of the policy filter). If any
syntax or processing error occurs, the script will terminate
immediately for this element. If the script returns non-zero,
the corresponding policy action will be executed for this
element.


5.2.1.  Implementation Notes

It is an implementation-dependent matter as to how policy
filters are scheduled. Each filter/element combination is
conceptually its own process and can be scheduled sequentially
or one or more could be run simultaneously.

Policy filters have no side-effects. Policy filter
interpreters are encouraged to stop processing a filter as
soon as it's return value is known.



5.3.  Policy Enforcement

For each element that has returned non-zero from the policy
filter, the corresponding policy action is called. The element
address is the only state that is passed to the script for
each invocation (in particular, no state is remembered from
the policy filter evaluation, nor from the previous
filter/action invocation of this element nor from the previous
invocation of the policy filter or action). If any syntax or
processing error occurs, the script will terminate immediately
for this element.


5.3.1.  Implementation Notes

It is an implementation-dependent matter as to how policy
actions are scheduled. Each filter/element combination is

6.  Policy Based Management Expression Language

Policy filters and policy actions are expressed with the
policy expression language. This expression language provides
the power to make parenthesized logical and arithmetic
comparisons and to call a number of pre-defined functions.

The policy expression language is a subset of the Perl and C
languages that is limited to expressions. Some examples of the
features that have been removed are: function definitions,
local variables, assignments, pointers (except for constant
pointers used for strings), arrays, structures, floating point
and pre-processor functions.

Because there is no referenceable standard specification of
the Perl language, this language is formally defined as a
subset of ANSI C [19]. The policy expression language is
defined in this standard by reference to ANSI C, but only
allows those constructs that may be expressed in the BNF
documented here. This is done because while BNF doesn't fully
specify syntactical rules (it allows constructs that are
invalid) and doesn't specify semantic rules, it can
successfully be used to define the subset of ANSI C that is
required for conformance to this standard.

The use of comments and newlines are allowed and encouraged
where they will promote readability of expressions.



6.1.  Formal Definition

The policy expression language follows the syntax and
semantics of ANSI C [19], but expressions are limited to those
that can be expressed in the following EBNF form:

    identifier        : letter ( letter | digit )*

    string            : '"' ascii_char* '"'

    expression        : const_exp ( ';' const_exp )*

    const_exp         : compound_exp | conditional_exp

    conditional_exp   : const_exp '?' const_exp ':' const_exp

6.2.  Accessor Functions

Several functions are available to provide access to
information on the local system. No functions are available
except for those described here.

6.2.1.  getint()

The getint() function is used to retrieve the value of an SNMP
MIB instance.

     int getint(char *objectIdentifier)

        objectIdentifier is a NULL terminated string containing an
        ASCII dotted-decimal representation of an object identifier
        (e.g. 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0).

        The 2-character token "$1" can be used in place of any
        decimal sub-identifier. This token is expanded by the agent
        at execution time to contain the index value of each
        element the expression acts upon. For example, if the element
        is interface #7, and the objectIdentifier is
        "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.$1", it will be expanded to
        "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.7".

        The agent will retrieve the instance in the same SNMP context
        in which the element resides. Note that no actual SNMP PDU
        needs to be generated and parsed when the policy MIB module
        resides on the same system as the managed elements.

        If the queried object identifier value does not exist or is
        not an integer-valued object, execution of the containing
        expression on the current element will immediately terminate
        and the associated policyAction will not be executed on the
        current element.

        This function returns the value of the integer-valued MIB
        instance.

        It is recommended that NMS user interfaces display and allow
        input of MIB object names by their descriptor values followed
        by the index in dotted-decimal form (e.g., "ifType.7).


6.2.2.  getstring()

The getstring() function is used to retrieve the value of an
SNMP MIB instance.

     char * getstring(char *objectIdentifier)

        objectIdentifier is a NULL terminated string containing an
        ASCII dotted-decimal representation of an object identifier
        (e.g. 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0).

        The 2-character token "$1" can be used in place of any
        decimal sub-identifier. This token is expanded by the agent
        at execution time to contain the index value of each
        element the expression acts upon. For example, if the element
        is interface #7, and the objectIdentifier is
        "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.$1", it will be expanded to
        "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.7".

        The agent will retrieve the instance in the same SNMP context
        in which the element resides. Note that no actual SNMP PDU
        needs to be generated and parsed when the policy MIB module
        resides on the same system as the managed elements.

        If the queried object identifier value does not exist or is
        not a string-valued or object-identifier-valued object,
        execution of the containing expression on the current
        element will immediately terminate and the associated
        policyAction will not be executed on the current element.

        This function returns a string containing the value of
        string-valued MIB instances or the ASCII dotted-decimal
        representation of object-identifier-valued instances.

        It is recommended that NMS user interfaces display and allow
        input of MIB object names by their descriptor values followed
        by the index in dotted-decimal form (e.g., "ifType.7).

6.2.3.  exists()

The exists() function is used to verify the existence of an
SNMP MIB instance.

     int exists(char *objectIdentifier)

        objectIdentifier is a NULL terminated string containing an
        ASCII dotted-decimal representation of an object identifier
        (e.g. 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0).

        The 2-character token "$1" can be used in place of any
        decimal sub-identifier. This token is expanded by the agent at
        execution time to contain the index value of each

        element the expression acts upon. For example, if the element
        is interface #7, and the objectIdentifier is
        "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.$1", it will be expanded to
        "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.7".

        The agent will retrieve the instance in the same SNMP context
        in which the element resides. Note that no actual SNMP PDU
        needs to be generated and parsed when the policy MIB module
        resides on the same system as the managed elements.

        This function returns the value 1 if the SNMP instance exists
        and 0 if it doesn't exist.

        It is recommended that NMS user interfaces display and allow
        input of MIB object names by their descriptor values followed
        by the index in dotted-decimal form (e.g., "ifType.7).


6.2.4.  elementName()

The elementName() function is used to determine what the
current element is and can be used to provide information
about the type of element as well as how it is indexed.

    char * elementName(void)

        elementName returns a NULL terminated string containing an
        ASCII dotted-decimal representation of an object identifier
        (e.g. 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0). This object identifier identifies an
        instance of a MIB object that is an attribute of this
        element.


6.2.5.  strcmp()

The strcmp() function is used to compare two strings.

    int strncmp(char *s1, char *s2, n)

        Arguments s1 and s2 are NULL terminated strings.

        Compares at most n bytes of s1 and s2, stopping at the end of

        Returns 1 if s1 is lexicographically greater than s2.
        Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are equal.


6.2.6.  lc_strcmp()

The lc_strcmp() function is used to compare two strings.

    int lc_strcmp(char *s1, char *s2)

        Arguments s1 and s2 are NULL terminated strings that are
        translated into lower case strings lc1 and lc2.

        Compares at most n bytes of s1 and s2, stopping at the end of
        either string.

        Then:
        Returns -1 if lc1 is lexicographically less than lc2.
        Returns 1 if lc1 is lexicographically greater than lc2.
        Returns 0 if lc1 and lc2 are equal.

6.2.7.  roleMatch()

The roleMatch() function is used to check to see if the
current element has been assigned a particular role.

    int roleMatch(char *roleString)

        Argument roleString is a NULL terminated string. If this
        exactly matches (content and length) any role assigned to the
        current element, the function returns 1. If no roles match,
        the function returns 0.

6.2.8.  capMatch()

The capMatch() function is used to check to see if the current
element has a certain capability.

    int capMatch(char *capString)

        Argument capability is a NULL terminated string containing a
        ASCII dotted-decimal representation of an object identifier
        that describes a capability as would be found in the
        pmCapabilitiesTable.

        If the current element has the capability described by
        capString, this function returns 1, otherwise it returns 0.

6.2.9.  setint()

The setint() function is used to set a MIB instance to a
certain integer value. The setint() function is only valid in
policyActions.  If when executing a policyFilter, the agent
encounters a call to the setint() function, execution of the
policyFilter for the current element will immediately
terminate and the associated policyAction will not be executed
on the current element.

    int setint(char *objectIdentifier, int value)

        objectIdentifier is a NULL terminated string containing an
        ASCII dotted-decimal representation of an object identifier
        (e.g. 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0).

        The 2-character token "$1" can be used in place of any
        decimal sub-identifier. This token is expanded by the agent
        at execution time to contain the index value of each
        element the expression acts upon. For example, if the element
        is interface #7, and the objectIdentifier is
        "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.$1", it will be expanded to
        "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.7".

        The agent will set the variable specified by objectIdentifier
        to the value specified by value.

        The agent will set the instance in the same SNMP context
        in which the element resides. Note that no actual SNMP PDU
        needs to be generated and parsed when the policy MIB module
        resides on the same system as the managed elements.

        If the queried object identifier value does not exist and
        cannot be created or is not an integer-valued object,
        0 is returned. If successful, 1 is returned.

        It is recommended that NMS user interfaces display and allow
        input of MIB object names by their descriptor values followed
        by the index in dotted-decimal form (e.g., "ifType.7).

6.2.10.  setstring()

The setstring() function is used to set a MIB instance to a
certain string value. The setstring() function is only valid
in policyActions.  If when executing a policyFilter, the agent
encounters a call to the setstring() function, execution of
the policyFilter for the current element will immediately
terminate and the associated policyAction will not be executed
on the current element.

    int setstring(char *objectIdentifier, char *value)

        objectIdentifier is a NULL terminated string containing an
        ASCII dotted-decimal representation of an object identifier
        (e.g. 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0).

        The 2-character token "$1" can be used in place of any
        decimal sub-identifier. This token is expanded by the agent
        at execution time to contain the index value of each
        element the expression acts upon. For example, if the element
        is interface #7, and the objectIdentifier is
        "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.$1", it will be expanded to
        "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.3.7".

        value is a NULL terminated string containing a
        sequence of bytes. The agent will set the variable
        specified by objectIdentifier to the value specified by value.

        The agent will set the instance in the same SNMP context
        in which the element resides. Note that no actual SNMP PDU
        needs to be generated and parsed when the policy MIB module
        resides on the same system as the managed elements.

        If the queried object identifier value does not exist and

valid in policyActions. If when executing a policyFilter, the
agent encounters a call to the setoid() function, execution of
the policyFilter for the current element will immediately
terminate and the associated policyAction will not be executed
on the current element.

    int setoid(char *objectIdentifier, int value)

        objectIdentifier is a NULL terminated string containing an
        ASCII dotted-decimal representation of an object identifier
        (e.g. 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0).

        The 2-character token "$1" can be used in place of any

    DESCRIPTION
        "The order in which policies on the local system are
        evaluated. A policy with a higher precedence value will
        be evaluated after a policy with a lower precedence. For
        example, a policy with a precedence value of 999 will be
        evaluated after a policy with a precedence value of 998.
        These values must be unique on the local policy system
        that realizes this module. The value for a particular
        policy should be the same across an administrative
        domain, though that is not mandatory.

        When the local policy system performs the evaluation in the
        pmPolicyFilter for the policy identified by this row it will
        also read the pmTrackingElementToPolicyStatus object for each
        object returned as a result of the policy evaluation.  If that
        object is set to modified(3), then the pmPolicyAction shall
        not be taken on that element.

        The value of precedence(4), of pmTrackingElementToPolicyStatus
        is an indication that when an evaluation was performed by
        another policy, the pmTrackingElementToPolicyStatus was found
        to have a value of on(1) and that policy had a higher
        precedence value than the policy that initially set the value
        of the pmTrackingElementToPolicyStatus to on(1). In this
        event, the pmTrackingElementToPolicyPrecedence object shall
        have the value of the pmPolicyIndex for the policy with the
        higher precedence value entered. If the policy identified by
        this row of the pmPolicyTable has a higher precedence value
        than the value found in pmTrackingElementToPolicyPrecedence
        then the pmPolicyAction should be performed on the element and
        the pmTrackingElementToPolicyPrecedence object updated with
        the value of the pmPolicyIndex for this policy. The only
        exception to these rules is when the policy that has the
        higher precedence value in not currently running, i.e., the

-- The Role String table is visible through 2 SNMP tables. The
-- pmRoleESTable is a read-create table that organized role strings
-- sorted by element. This table is used to create and modify role
-- strings and their associations.
-- The pmRoleSETable is a read-only table that organizes role strings
-- sorted by string. This table is read-only.

8.  Security Considerations

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
create.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or
vulnerable in some network environments.  The support for SET
operations in a non-secure environment without proper
protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the
network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even
then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically,
the use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the
View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the
SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is
properly configured to give access to the objects only to
those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed
GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
