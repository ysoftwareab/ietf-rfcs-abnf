m=control <port number> <transport> SCP/0.1
a=fmtp:SCP/0.1 conf=<confid>

   An example of a SDP record describing a control session may look
   like this:

v=0
o=chr 2890844526 2890842807 IN IP4 193.175.133.195
s=SCP Seminar
i=A Seminar on the Session Control Protocol
e=reichert@fokus.gmd.de (Christoph Reichert)
c=IN IP4 224.2.2.2/127
t=0 0
m=control 8000 udp SCP/0.1
a=fmtp:conf=xyz123@193.175.133.195

   An SCP control session has an explicit representation within the
   control session,  the SCP conference object.  The fmtp:conf
   attribute denotes the globally unique identifier for this
   object.  This identifier is also part of the message header.
   Basically, this identifier should be communicated outside of
   SCP, as SCP messages must include the conference identifier.
   This is the rational behind the fmtp attribute in the last line
   of the example above.

   If only IP multicast address and port number are known, an SCP
   agent may join the multicast group and listen for a while to
   learn the conference id.

M = { m1, m2, ..., mm }.

X = (V, R, A, M).

Xm = (Vm, Rm, Am, Mm).

M = set_unify(Mm, M)        //   collect masked timestamps 
M = set_insert(A, M);	// add A as a masked timestamp
M = set_insert(Am, M);	// add Am as masked timestamp
M = set_insert(Am, M);     // add Am as a "wrong" follow up
            return;
V = Vm;
R = Rm;
A = Am;
   }

   If the operation is a DELETE operation, no value is assigned, of
   course.  In this case, the object is marked as deleted.  In case
   the retransmitter of a deleted object (ie. the retransmitter of
   the DELETE operation) leaves the session, a potential
   "lexicographical" neighbour should prepare to continue the
   retransmissions for the deleted objects it may inherit.
