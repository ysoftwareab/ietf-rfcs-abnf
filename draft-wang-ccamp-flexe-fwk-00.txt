Abstract

   Flex Ethernet (FlexE) technology, which is defined by Optical
   Internetworking Forum (OIF), is a new kind of data plane technology
   and can be used to provides a generic mechanism for supporting a
   variety of Ethernet MAC rates that may or may not correspond to any
   existing Ethernet PHY rate.  This includes MAC rates that are both
   greater than (through bonding) and less than (through sub-rate and
   channelization) the Ethernet PHY rates used to carry FlexE.

   Based on the applications/use cases given in the Flex Ethernet
   Implementation Agreement, this document defines a framework and
   control plane requirements for the application of existing GMPLS
   architecture and control plane protocols to the control of flexible
   Ethernet network.  The actual extensions to the GMPLS protocols will
   be defined in companion documents.

1.  Introduction

   As defined in Flex Ethernet (FlexE) Implementation Agreement, FlexE
   can provide a generic mechanism for supporting a variety of Ethernet
   MAC rates that may or may not correspond to any existing Ethernet PHY
   rate.  In a more detailed description, FlexE employs more than one
   Ethernet PHYs as server layer and these Ethernet PHYs are bonded
   together as a FlexE group to carry FlexE client signal.  The general
   capabilities supported by FlexE implementation includes:

      Bonding of Ethernet PHYs, e.g., supporting a 200G MAC over two
      bonded 100GBASE-R PHYs.

      Sub-rates of Ethernet PHYs, e.g., supporting a 50G MAC over a
      100GBASE-R PHY.

      Channelization within a PHY or a group of bonded PHYs, e.g,
      support a 150G and two 25G MACs over two bonded 100GBASE-R PHYs.

   Note that hybrids are also possible, for example a sub-rate of a
   group of bonded PHYs, for example, a 250G MAC over three bonded
   100GBASE-R PHYs.

   In order to operate on the Ethernet PHYs, FlexE mechanism operates
   using a calendar which assigns slot positions on sub-calendars on
   each PHY of the FlexE group to each of the FlexE clients.  The
   calendar has a granularity of 5G, and has a length of 20 slots per
   100G of FlexE group capacity.

   Based on the FlexE Implementation Agreement, this document defines
   the framework for GMPLS-based control of flexible Ethernet network to
   depict the layer model of Flex Ethernet as well as a set of
   associated control-plane requirements.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Overview of FlexE Networks

2.1.  FlexE Terminology

   This section presents the definitions of the terms used in FlexE
   networks.  More details about these terms can be found in OIF Flex
   Ethernet (FlexE) Implementation Agreement.

      FlexE group: the FlexE Group refers to a group of from 1 to n
      bonded Ethernet PHYs.  This version of the Implementation
      Agreement supports FlexE groups composed of one or more bonded
      100GBASE-R PHYs.

      FlexE Client: a FlexE Client is an Ethernet flow based on a MAC
      data rate that may or may not correspond to any Ethernet PHY rate.
      The FlexE client MAC rates supported by this implementation
      agreement are 10, 40, and m * 25 Gb/s.

      FlexE Shim: the FlexE Shim is the layer that maps or demaps the
      FlexE clients carried over a FlexE group.  The FlexE mux refers to
      the transmit direction which maps the FlexE clients over the FlexE
      group.  The FlexE demux refers to the receive direction which
      demaps the FlexE clients from the FlexE group.

2.2.  Scenarios Supported by FlexE

   According to the FlexE Implementation Agreement, FlexE can support a
   variety of cases.  A non-exhaustive list includes:

      One case of router to transport connection is where the transport
      network is unaware of FlexE.  This may be used with legacy
      transport equipment that provides PCS-codeword transparent
      transport of 100GbE, but provides no special support for FlexE.
      In this case, all PHYs of the FlexE group are carried
      independently, but over the same fiber route, over the transport
      network.

      Another case of router to transport connection is where the
      transport network equipment terminates the FlexE group.  In the
      FlexE terminating case, FlexE group is terminated before crossing
      the transport network and FlexE client is extracted from the FlexE
      signal and then carried over the transport network.

      The final router to transport example described is one where the
      transport network is aware that it is carrying FlexE PHYs (as
      opposed to 100GbE), but the FlexE group is not terminated on the
      transport equipment.  Transport network equipment may "crunch" the
      PHY of the FlexE group by allowing bits or bytes to be discarded
      from the unavailable calendar slots at the transport network
      ingress and these bits or bytes re-inserted with fixed values at
      the transport network egress.  This may be used to support cases
      where the Ethernet PHY rate is be greater than the wavelength
      rate, the wavelength rate is not an integral multiple of the PHY
      rate, or there is a reason (for example, wavelengths terminated on
      different transponder line cards) that it is not possible to
      terminate the FlexE group in the transport equipment.  This kind

      of equipment is a kind of special transport equipment which can
      support partial-rate transport.

2.3.  FlexE Layer Model

   Based on the cases addressed in section 3.2, FlexE has different
   kinds of mapping hierarchy accordingly.  This section gives
   description of FlexE layer model in different cases.  Figure 1
   depicts a FlexE layered network scenario.  In this network, B and E
   are FlexE capable nodes, C and D are OTN ODUflex/ODU4 capable nodes.
   Node B, C are mainly used to encapsulate the client layer signal into
   the server layer, while node D, E are mainly used to extract the
   client layer signal from the server layer signal.

   As defined in FlexE Implementation Agreement, a FlexE client may be
   generated internally within a system, received from an Ethernet PHY
   or from another FlexE shim.  In this network scenario, we suppose the
   FlexE client is generated in router B.

   Feature of cases can be found in section 3.2.

   In all cases, FlexE client at node B has a path setup request from
   source B to destination E.

                       Figure 1: FlexE Layer Network

2.3.1.  Layer Model in FlexE Unaware Case

   In this case which is depicted in Figure 2, there exist four network
   layers.  FlexE client layer represents an end-to-end connection,
   which is from the source B to destination E.  When the FlexE client
   signal is generated inside node B, the FlexE client signal is first
   placed into the slots of FlexE, then the FlexE signal is carried by
   Ethernet PHYs towards the destination E.  When the Ethernet PHYs
   arrive at node C, each PHY will be mapped into a separate ODU4
   connection and then transferred towards the ODU layer connection
   destination D.

   Four layers exist in this case, and the mapping hierarchy between
   node C and node D can be seen in Figure 3.

2.3.2.  Layer Model in FlexE Terminating Case

   In this case, FlexE client layer represents an end-to-end connection,
   which is from the source B to destination E.  When the FlexE client
   signal is generated inside node B,, the Ethernet signal is first
   placed into the slots of FlexE, then the FlexE signal is carried by
   Ethernet PHYs towards the destination C.  When the FlexE signal
   arrives at node C, node C first extracts the FlexE client signal,
   then maps the Ethernet client signal into ODU signal and transfers
   towards destination node D.  Node D will first extract the FlexE
   client signal from the ODU signal, then map the Ethernet client
   signal into FlexE signal, which will then be carried by Ethernet PHYs
   towards destination node E.

   Two segments of FlexE connection exist in this case. one is from node
   B to node C, and the other is from node D to node E.

   FlexE client layer represents an end-to-end connection, which is from
   the source B to destination E.  When the FlexE client signal is
   generated inside node B,, the Ethernet signal is first placed into
   the slots of FlexE, then the FlexE signal is carried by Ethernet PHYs
   towards the destination E.  When the FlexE signal arrives at node C,
   node C will first discards unavailable slots, then transfers the left
   slots to ODU Connection.

   In this scenario, Ethernet PHYs connection exist between node B and
   node C, node D and node E.

3.  GMPLS Applicability

   The goal of this section is to provide an insight into the
   application of GMPLS as a control mechanism in FlexE networks.
   Specific control-plane requirements for the support of FlexE networks
   are covered in Section 5.  This framework is aimed at controlling the
   FlexE shim layer in different network scenario based on the

   capability of FlexE described in OIF Flex Ethernet (FlexE)
   Implementation Agreement.

3.1.  General Considerations

   The GMPLS control of the FlexE layer deals with the establishment of
   FlexE connections that are transferred in FlexE capable nodes.  GMPLS
   labels are used to locally represent the FlexE connections and its
   associated slots transferring.

3.2.  Consideration of LSPs in FlexE

   The FlexE LSP is a control-plane representation of a FlexE Connection
   and MUST be carried by Ethernet PHYs LSP or ODU LSP in the network.

   Figure 4 depicts a scenario that the FlexE LSP is carried over
   Ethernet PHYs LSP between node B and node C, node D and node E.  When
   the Ethernet client signal arrives at node B, node B first check if
   there are enough Ethernet PHYs available for setting up FlexE LSP.
   If no, node B will first set up Ethernet PHYs LSP from node B to node
   C, and then set up the FlexE LSP over the Ethernet PHYs LSP.  This
   process involves twice signalling procedures, one is to set up
   Ethernet PHYs, and the other is used to set up FlexE LSP over the
   Ethernet PHYs.  The set-up signalling of FlexE LSP includes the
   allocation of resource for Ethernet client.

   Figure 7 depicts a scenario that the FlexE LSP is carried over ODU
   LSP between node C and node D.  This scenario is different, and is
   used to support cases where the Ethernet PHY rate is be greater than
   the wavelength rate, the wavelength rate is not an integral multiple
   of the PHY rate.  Node C and node D MUST support the partial-rate
   ability.  When the FlexE LSP over Ethernet PHYs arrives at node C,
   node C first check if there is enough resource for carrying the FlexE
   LSP signal across the transport network.  If no, node C will check if
   there is enough resource for carrying FlexE LSP signal after
   discarding the unavailable slots.  If yes, node C will first set up
   the ODUFlex LSP to node D, and then continue the signalling process
   of FlexE LSP across the transport network.

3.3.  Control-Plane Modelling of FlexE Network Elements

   FlexE is a new kinds of transport technology, which brings new
   constraints.  These constraints are listed below:

      Unavailable slots: this is different from "unused" slot, in that
      it is known, due to transport network constraints, that not all of
      the calendar slots generated from the FlexE mux will reach the
      FlexE demux and therefore no FlexE client should be assigned to



Wang                    Expires September 8, 2016               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft            GMPLS FlexE Framework               March 2016


      those slots.  As defined in the Flex Ethernet Implementation
      Agreement, unavailable slots are always at the end of the sub-
      calendar configuration for the respective PHY.

      Unused slots: unused slots can be allocated to Ethernet client as
      available resource.

      Partial-rate capability: the partial-rate capability is usually
      supported by an OTN access equipment.  If an equipment supports
      partial-rate, it means this equipment has the capability of
      discarding unavailable slots and transfers the left slots across
      OTN transport network.

      Slot granularity: currently, only one kinds of 5G slot granularity
      is defined in OIF Flex Ethernet (FlexE) Implementation Agreement.

3.4.  FlexE Layer Resource Allocation Considerations

   FlexE LSP transfers based on the slot information, so it SHOULD be
   able to expose the unused slot resource information towards the
   client layer.  Besides the slot information, there are also many
   other attributes that need to be specified when allocating resource.
   In GMPLS-controlled system, these information should be taken into
   consideration as a label when transferring.

      FlexE group number: a bunch of Ethernet PHYs can be bounded
      together and used as a whole by the FlexE LSP.  FlexE LSPs between
      the same source and destination equipment SHOULD NOT have the same
      FlexE group number.  Source equipment and destination equipment
      SHOULD be aware of the existing of FlexE group and which Ethernet
      PHYs are in which FlexE group.

      PHY Number: it's a dynamic and logical number that is assigned
      through control plane or management plane, which is unique within
      the context of (source, destination), and has a one-to-one
      correlation with physical port.  This information will also be
      carried in the FlexE overhead.  Source equipment and destination
      equipment SHOULD negotiate a value for every Ethernet PHYs within
      one FlexE group.

      Slot Assignment information: the FlexE LSP transfers based on the
      slot positions, so the equipment SHOULD be able to tell which slot
      is assigned to which client.

      Partial-rate: during the process of resource allocation, where the
      partial-rate would happen should be indicated.

Internet-Draft            GMPLS FlexE Framework               March 2016


      Granularity: currently, only one kinds of 5G slot granularity is
      defined in OIF Flex Ethernet (FlexE) Implementation Agreement.

3.5.  Neighbour Discovery and Link Property Correlation

   There are potential interworking problems between different FlexE
   capable equipment.  Devices or equipments might not be able to
   support the interworking of every slot due to the constraints of
   transport network or other constraints.  In this case, two directly
   connected FlexE capable equipments SHOULD run the neighbour discovery
   process and correlate the link property to make sure which slots are
   unavailable, which slots can be used by the client.

3.6.  Routing and Topology Dissemination

   The topology and routing information is used by the path computation
   entity to compute an end-to-end path.  Besides the basic
   interconnected information, there are also some FlexE specific
   attributes that should be taken into consideration.

      Partial-rate: partial-rate capability is a special feature which
      allows an equipment to discard unavailable slots and transfers the
      left slots across OTN transport network.  Path computation entity
      is more likely to compute a feasible path if this capability is
      taken into consideration when computing path.

      Unavailable slot information: this information is used to indicate
      certain slots SHOULD not be considered when computing an end-to-
      end path.  The unavailable slots can not be used to transfer
      signal because of the transport constraints.

      Unused slot information: unused slot can be allocated to the path
      as available resource.

4.  Control-Plane Requirements

   The control of FlexE networks places additional requirements on the
   GMPLS protocols.  This section summarizes those requirements for
   signalling and routing.

4.1.  Support for Signalling of FlexE

   The signalling procedures shall be able to assign an FlexE group
   number for a FlexE LSP, so a number of Ethernet PHYs can be bonded
   together and uniquely indicated.

   The signalling procedures shall be able to assign an unique PHY
   number for each bonded Ethernet PHY, and a correlation relationship



Wang                    Expires September 8, 2016              [Page 11]

Internet-Draft            GMPLS FlexE Framework               March 2016


   SHOULD also be indicated between the assigned PHY number and real
   physical port number when signalling.

   The signalling procedures shall be able to configure the slots
   information allocated for a FlexE LSP.

   The Signalling procedures shall be able to indicate the palace where
   partial-rate mapping happens.

4.2.  Support for Routing of FlexE

   The routing protocol will support all functions described in
   [RFC4202] and extend them to a FlexE data plane.

   The routing protocol SHALL distribute sufficient information to
   compute paths to enable the signalling procedure to establish LSPs as
   described in the previous sections.

   The routing protocol SHALL update its advertisements of available
   resources and capabilities to include the partial-rate support
   information and unused slot information on each Ethernet PHY port.

4.3.  Support for Neighbour Discovery and Link Property and Link
      Correlation

   The control plane MAY include support for neighbour discovery such
   that a FlexE network can be constructed in a "plug-and-play" manner.

   The control plane SHOULD allow the nodes at opposite ends of a link
   to correlate the properties that they will apply to the link.  Such a
   correlation SHOULD include at least the identities of the nodes and
   the identities that they apply to the link.  Other FlexE specific
   properties, such as the link characteristics of unavailable slot
   information, SHOULD also be correlated.  Such neighbour discovery and
   link property correlation, if provided, MUST be able to operate in
   both an out-of-band manner.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD

6.  Manageability Considerations

   TBD
